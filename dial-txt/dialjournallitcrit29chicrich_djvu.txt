dents of the most stirring character are blended with political 
and social pictures of an interesting period. The last days of 
the Grand Monarque, clouded with baffled ambitions and 
domestic sorrow, the intrigues which surrounded the Peace of 
Utrecht, the antagonism between Orleans and Madame de 
Maintenon in the microcosm of Versailles, the perfidies of 
statesmen, and one above all, are set forth with liveliness." 
London Athenceum, 

" It is a clever story, ranking well ahead of ' When Knight- 
hood Was in Flower ' and several other romances that have 
had great vogue. It is the best book we have seen in respect 
to cover, contents, and cuts." Newark Daily Advertiser. 

"The story will fully repay the perusal. A noteworthy 
feature of the volume is the excellent finish of the many full- 
page illustrations which are scattered throughout the book." 
The Sunday States. 

" The book is in all respects a capital story. Belongs more 
nearly to the school of "The Three Musketeers" than any 
historical romance that has been written for some years." 
Toronto Globe. 



the reading public to a new writer of great dramatic power. 
Mr. Hayes has been long before the public as an artist. He 
is responsible for the sixteen beautiful illustrations which 
illuminate the pages. Of the book itself one can truly say 
that it is entitled to rank with the best historical novels of 
the day. Those who have followed with breathless interest 
and mingled emotions the fortunes of Ambrose Gwynett will

SOUTHERN HEARTS 

By FLORENCE HULL WINTERBURN 

Size, 7o x 5 ', inches. Small pica type. 466 pages. Extra paper. Beautiful cover design. Extra cloth. 

Price, $1.25. 

There is excellent reason why Florence Hull Winterburn's new book, " Southern Hearts," should be a favorite 
with women. Equally good reason why men should not care for it. The author has drawn her characters with 
vivid, graphic touch, to the life. A brighter, pleasanter collection of stories for summer reading there cannot 
be. Says the Globe-Democrat, St. Louis, Mo.: 

" The author has portrayed with strength and delicacy the many phases of character she has introduced into 
her stories, and has shown rare insight in her delineations." 

" They are far better than the average short story, so much better that it is a long way from a good comparison ; in fact, 
it is almost sacrilege. But one must read them. The book is certainly one that the author and publisher may well be proud 
of ." Toledo Daily News. 

" The book is an excellent one for summer reading." Louisville Courier- Journal.

A WOMAN'S PARIS 

With 40 half-tone illustrations from photographs. 

" A Woman's Paris " is intended for the use of the American lady who is about to visit Paris, and who 
wishes while she is there " to do the agreeable things there are to do and to avoid the disagreeable things there 
are not to do." The author is herself an American woman who knows her Paris, and who has tried to take up 
systematically, but readably and entertainingly, the questions of living, of servants, of cabs, of churches and 
theatres, of shopping, of dressmakers, of sports, of prices, and a dozen other things, and to point out to her 
countrywomen just how they may everywhere have the best and pleasantest experience possible. The book 
is fully illustrated, and contains chapters on the Exposition and on " Fair " prices. 

Although in no sense a guide or hand-book, " A Woman's Paris " is more largely instructive than either 
and as entertaining as it is timely.

GOOD BOOKS PW: 
FOR SUMMER READING 



Oh, What a Plague is Love! 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of " The Dear Irish 

Girl," " She Walks in Beauty," etc. 12mo. 75 cts. 

In this bright little story, the author has told in a most 
entertaining way how a too keen susceptibility to the tender 
passion on the part of a gallant though somewhat elderly 
gentleman is a constant source of anxiety to his grown-up 
children, who are devotedly attached to him. 

The dialogue is sparkling throughout, the characters 
charmingly naive and natural, and the book fairly bubbles 
over with fun and good humor. It is an ideal book for 
summer outings. 

" Leigh Hunt would have delighted in Mrs. Hinkson. 
He knew how to value high spirits in a writer, and the 
gaiety of this cheerful story would have charmed him im- 
mensely." The Saturday Review. 

The Dread and Fear of Kings. 

By J. BRECKENRIDGE ELLIS. 12mo. $1.25. 

The period of this romance is the beginning of the Chris- 
tian era, and the scenes are laid in Rome, the island of 
Capri, and other parts of Italy. The interest of the love 
story, the exciting incidents, and the spirited dialogue en- 
chain the attention of the reader. 

"For stirring adventure and romantic love scenes, one 
need go no farther. Mr. Ellis has written a book that will 
be eagerly read by all who like a stirring and well-told 
story." The Chicago Tribune. 

'" One of the very best novels that have been published 
recently. So vivid are this novelist's colors, so real his 
speech and action, so superior his arrangement of plot and 
counterplot that hardly another touch is needed to make 
the literary relationship of ' The Dread and Fear of Kings ' 
to actual Roman history completely satisfactory." Boston 
Times. 

The Cardinal's Musketeer. 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR, author of "On the Red Stair- 
case," "An Imperial Lover," etc. 12mo. $1.25. 
A rousing tale of adventure and love whose scenes are 
laid in France in the time of Richelieu. 

" It is a strong, well-studied reproduction of the times of 
Cardinal Richelieu. . . . The tale is full of life and love, 
of daring night rides, of gallant fights. It is a stirring ro- 
mance, overflowing with life and action." The Indianap- 
olis News. 

" The movement is rapid and easy, and the interest sus- 
tained by thrilling adventure, dangerous situation and 
fortunate escape. A delicately worked thread of romance 
runs through the story and brings it to a happy conclusion." 
The Home Journal (New York). 

"The interest of the book never flags." The Outlook. 

The Dear Irish Girl. 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of "Oh, What a 

Plague is Love ! " etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

"The story has delightful bits of character, quaint pic- 
tures of places and people, the true Irish atmosphere of 
sunny innocence and quick mirthf uluess, the social ease and 
insouciance, the ready humor which is not to be analyzed, 
all the characteristics we look for are there." The World 
(London, England). 



McLoughlin and Old Oregon. 

A Chronicle. 

By EVA EMERY DYE. 12 mo, gilt top, with frontis- 
piece, $1.50. 

This is a most graphic and interesting chronicle of the 
movement that added to the United States that vast terri- 
tory, previously a British possession, of which Oregon 
formed a part, and of how Dr. John McLoughlin, then chief 
Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company for the Northwest, 
by his fatherly interest in the settlers, displeased the Hud- 
son's Bay Company and aided the United States. 

" Get the book if you would be thrilled by a tale of truth, 
for it is really wonderful. It is a history which, while accu- 
rate and detailed, holds all the attraction of a work of fiction, 
and the narrative is wholesome and good." Boston Times. 

Memoirs of Alexander I. 

And the Court of Russia. 

By Mme. La Comtesse DE CHOISEUL-GOUFFIER. 

Translated from the French by MARY BERENICE 

PATTERSON. With portraits, 12mo, gilt top, deckle 

edges, $1.50. 

The author of this volume was an intimate friend of 
Alexander and an ardent supporter of his foreign and do- 
mestic policy. When Napoleon entered Russia she was pre- 
sented to him, and her pages contain a life-like and charac- 
teristic picture, though not a very flattering one, of the 
" Little Corporal." The book is full of bright, witty say- 
ings, and presents a remarkably true portrait of Alexander, 
who occupied during the first quarter of the nineteenth 
century as preeminent a position in the world of diplomacy 
as did Napoleon in military affairs. Only two copies of the 
original of this work are known to exist from one of 
which the present translation has been made. 

Opportunity 

And Other Essays and Addresses. 

By Rt. Rev. J. L. SPALDING, Bishop of Peoria, author 

of " Education and the Higher Life," " Things of 

the Mind," etc. 12mo, $1.00. 

A valuable contribution to modern thought on education 
and other topics. 

" All that Bishop Spalding writes is sure to be said grace- 
fully and earnestly, in love and charity. He is surely one 
of the highest types of ' Americanism ' that the Church of 
Rome has produced." The Churchman (New York). 

The Honey-Makers. 

By MARGARET W. MORLEY, author of " A Song of 

Life," " Life and Love," " The Bee People," etc. 

12mo, gilt top, illustrated, $1.50. 

A book about bees for bee-lovers and others. 

" Miss Morley combines the thoroughness, accuracy, and 
enthusiasm of a naturalist with the graceful touch of a 
skilled artist. Not only does she reveal with simplicity and 
care the organization and habits of the honey bee, but she 
indulges in felicities of expression that impart an additional 
charm to her story. Miss Morley indicates in the last half 
of the volume the place which the bee and its products have 
held in literature, ancient and modern." N. Y. Tribune.

BY 

I MARY E. WILKINS 

MISTRESS MARY CAVENDISH had a " tabby petticoat of a crimson color, 
and a crimson satin bodice shining over her arms and shoulders like the 
plumage of a bird, and down her back streamed her curls, shining like gold under 
her gauze love-hood." This young lady certainly lends charm to the opening of 
Miss Wilkins's first venture in the field of historical romance, nor does the rest of 
the story belie this auspicious beginning. The novel is designedly more subjective 
than most members of its class, but the development of personality is at no expense 
of movement or interest, the scene being laid just after Bacon's Rebellion, and a 
dramatic incident being the destruction of the young tobacco crop to elude the 
Navigation Act.

AN EPIC OF THE WEST. 

The Girl at the Halfway House. 

A Romance. By E. HOUGH, author of "The 
Story of the Cowboy." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
A dramatic picture of a battle which has been compared to 
scenes in "The Red Badge of Courage," opens the story. 
After this "Day of War" there comes "The Day of the 
Buffalo." The reader follows the course of the hero and his 
friend, a picturesque old army veteran, to the frontier, then 
found on the Western plains. The third part of the story is 
called " The Day of the Cattle," and the fourth part of the 
story " The Day of the Plow." While this story is a novel 
with a love motive, it is perhaps most striking as a romance 
of the picturesque and dramatic days of early Western life. 
It shows the movement westward, and the free play of prim- 
itive forces in the opening of a new country. Nothing has 
been written on the opening of the West to excel this romance 
in epic quality, and its historic interest, as well as its freshness, 
vividness, and absorbing interest, should appeal to every 
American reader.

Pine Knot. 

A Story of Kentucky Life. By WILLIAM E. 

BARTON, author of " A Hero in Homespun." Illus-

The story is full of the atmosphere of the quaint mountain 
life with its wealth of amusing peculiarities, and it also has 
a historical value, since it pictures conditions attendant upon 
the anti-slavery movement and the days of the war. The 
interest of a treasure search runs through the tale, since the 
author has adroitly utilized a mountain legend of a lost mine. 
" Pine Knot " is a romance " racy of the soil " in a true sense, 
a story fresh, strong, and absorbing in its interest throughout.

" In Henry Wilton Thomas has arisen the historic playright 
if not historian of the Italy of New York. His tale of ' Mul-

ing trout, salmon, ouananiche, bass, perch, pike, and other

CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF 
THE I-NOVEL. 

A German novelist and critic, Spielhagen, 
has called the attention of students of the novel 
to certain characteristics that seem to distin- 
guish narratives related in the first person 
from those told in the third person. The 
novel of the first person he has called, with the 
facility of his language in the coining of tech- 
nical terms, der Ich- Roman, the I-novel ; and 
the phrase is apt enough, perhaps, to excuse an 
attempt to include it in English critical term- 
inology. Though Spielhagen applies the word 
especially to an autobiographical novel, many 
of his remarks have an application to the struc- 
ture of narrative of the first person that is 
generic. The autobiographical quality, indeed, 
must in any case be relative ; and it is my pur- 
pose to study on Spielhagen's lines a few 
novels that are not autobiographical. 

Yet if an autobiographical novel is cast in 
the first person, its directness of form makes 
it seem to most readers more lifelike and con- 
vincing. It gains thereby an added degree 
of personal closeness. Directness, therefore, 
and a resulting capacity for intensity are the 
qualities first remarked as belonging to the 
I-structure. How inherent these are may be 
proved by the great difference in the nature of 
some of the novels that the I-form helps to 
vitalize. From Stevenson's " Treasure Island " 
to Kingsley's " Alton Locke " and to Bronte's 
" Jane Eyre " is a far cry ; none of these is in 
any large sense autobiographical, yet they all 
possess an unusual degree of vividness. They 
are representatives of three distinct classes, 
the story of adventure, the tract-novel, and the 
novel of passion. Each of these kinds, if well 
written, is likely to be intense, but for different 
reasons. The story of adventure of the type of 
Stevenson's is intense through the excitement 
aroused by following the incidents. The tract- 
novel, written with the express purpose of set- 
ting forth the author's ideas on moral or public 
questions, is likely to be intense through the 
writer's earnestness of feeling and purpose. 
And the novel of passion, if it really succeeds 
in delineating some great primary emotion, is 
thereby certain to be intense. 

Now this intensity in the nature of the ma- 



12 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



terial is at once aided by the first-person form 
of discourse. The form agrees with the spirit 
it clothes. The truth of this analysis receives 
some proof by the absence, in the three novels 
mentioned, of diversity of characterization and 
multiplicity of interests. " Treasure Island " 
shows little breadth of characterization, though 
it reveals some vivid figures ; and its interest is 
single. " Alton Locke " has a gifted tailor for 
a hero, and is concerned with portraying him 
as a tailor and a workman. Conditions, rather 
than people, are pictured and characterized, 
and these conditions are strictly limited both in 
extent and time. Compared with " Marcella," 
for example, which is less distinctly a tract- 
novel, " Alton Locke " has a much more con- 
fined range of interest and characterization. 
" Jane Eyre " is remarkable for its narrow 
range, for its singleness of effect. Two per- 
sons, two only, stand out in high relief from a 
background offering little variety of scenery, 
personage, or incident. We pass far into the 
hearts of those two, and that suffices. " The 
Vicar of Wakefield," also an I-novel and one 
not closely autobiographical, has again not 
much diversity of character, incident, or con- 
dition. This novel is the history of a group 
rather than of one ; but of strictly narrative 
material it contains little not directly connected 
with this immortal group. None of these novels 
attempts to give the life of a community, 
none of them possesses epic fulness ; none 
of them accomplishes an equally full, just, 
and lively delineation of several personages, 
such as is found in many third- person novels. 
They contrast markedly in this particular with 
" Middlemarch," for example, with its complex 
plot, its skilful portrayal of diverse character, 
and its varied background ; or, again with 
Meredith's "Egoist," where, though a relatively 
small company of persons is studied, and the 
background is slight, we yet find subtle and 
elaborate analysis of one after another of the 
chief figures. To such work as this the I-form 
is not adapted. 

The reason for this is that the I-form com- 
pels a certain unity or singleness of structure 
because of the structural importance of the 
narrator. The whole story must, of course, 
pass through the mind of the I-narrator ; he 
must be present everywhere, and in a way ab- 
sorb everything into himself. Unity of material 
is indeed not required ; for this structural unity 
dependent on the narrator is so inherent that 
it can hold together a great diversity of mate- 
rial. This is why in a story of adventure of 



the picaresque type, in which there is little 
logical connection between incidents and slight 
study of character, there is nevertheless one 
kind of structural unity : the unity, namely, 
of a biography. But in such stories concen- 
tration or intensity of feeling is impossible. 
" Roderick Random," here used as representa- 
tive of this type, shows life from many points 
of view, and has a varied background. Yet 
everything is seen superficially, and is sub- 
jected to the demands of the hero in his role of 
adventurer. In fact, the I-novel of the single- 
narrator type cannot, or at least does not, as 
the third-person form may, include both breadth 
and intensity. Dickens's " Copperfield " and 
" Great Expectations " (of the novels here 
studied) most nearly succeed in doing this. 
And yet the quality of these I-novels is not 
essentially different from that of Dickens's 
other stories, and it is not the quality (it lacks, 
indeed, the element of intensity) of either 
" The Egoist," " Jane Eyre," or " Treasure 
Island." Looked at from this point of view, 
Dickens's I-novels are more akin to " Roderick 
Random." 

This structural importance of the narrator is 
certainly one of the most noteworthy charac- 
teristics of the I-novel. The narrator always 
remains the structural centre, even if he is by 
no means the most interesting personage. In 
a story like " Cranford," where the narrator 
scarcely claims the reader's attention, he yet 
remains the connecting link or the motive 
power of a whole group, furnishing so far as 
there is any the logic of their appearances 
and behavior. 

But if the I-form can partially unify diver- 
sity and reinforce intensity, it yet has also 
special off-setting difficulties. The problem of 
legitimacy, of rendering natural the narrator's 
knowledge and ignorance, his presence and his 
absence, his acting and his not acting, is not 
easy of solution. The difficulty peculiar to the 
I-form lies in the fact that the narrator is a 
double personage. Logically, he of course rep- 
resents the author, yet he is also a figure in 
the story. As author he is bound if the 
novel is to have the higher artistic effects of 
which narrative is capable to prepare the 
reader for what is to come. Being the pivot 
on which the structure turns, he rather than 
the other personages must carry the chief bur- 
den of this preparation. Yet as one of the 
figures in the story, the narrator must himself 
not see what it is too early for him to see ; and 
even after he has the knowledge that would

naturally lead to action, he must not act before 
the proper time. He must be a transparent 
medium through which the reader may dimly 
behold the future, himself remaining passive, 
unresisting, and unperceiving ; nevertheless, he 
is supposed to be endowed with the usual de- 
gree of intelligence and activity. This is the 
crux of the I-form. How shall this double 
personality be maintained with lifelikeness ? 
How solve the problem that demands from the 
narrator enlightenment of the reader and at 
the same time blindness or inaction in himself? 
The magnitude of the problem of legitimacy 
is apparent when a master like Stevenson re- 
sorts to such a trick as that on which " Treas- 
ure Island " hinges, the boy-hero, with no 
malice prepense, climbing into 'a nearly empty 
apple-barrel and falling asleep ; to be oppor- 
tunely waked to hear the treachery of the ship's 
crew. The hero's knowledge of what occurs on 
the island aside from what happens to him- 
self, which is far more important is legiti- 
mated by making him an eaves-dropper. 
Indeed, eaves-dropping or accidental overhear- 
ing is a device used in nearly every one of the 
novels here studied. Accident is, of course, 
an easy mode of legitimation. It necessarily 
plays some part in any picture of life, but the 
reader dislikes the too frequent or the too 
opportune accident. " Roderick Random," for 
example, uses chance so abundantly and so 
unskilfully as fairly to arouse resentment. 
The problem of legitimacy here, as in other 
similar stories, chiefly concerns the sudden 
changes of fortune undergone by the hero ; and 
these are due, not to his character, but to a 
stroke of good or ill luck. " The Vicar of Wake- 
field " shows especially the difficulty of bring- 
ing the persons together ; a difficulty naturally 
greater after the narrator is in prison, where he 
is nevertheless to meet all the others. Nor is 
the problem well solved in " Jane Eyre." Here 
the preparation of the reader is directly and 
seriously at variance with the needed ignorance 
of the heroine. How can Jane come so near 
the lunatic as she does, and witness so much 
of the results of frensy, without divining the 
truth ? Her ignorance is legitimated, but hardly 
adequately, by Rochester's preliminary order 
to withhold all knowledge of the crazy woman 
from the governess, and later by his personal 
care to silence any suspicions she has. Scrutiny 
of the plot reveals other improbabilities ; but of 
this novel the incidents and the plot, though 
single and strong in places, are swallowed up 
in the intensity with which the author presents 



the themes of love, separation, and reunion. 
To her the presenting means must have been a 
minor matter. The novels analyzed seem to 
show that the I-structure is especially effective 
in a story built upon adventure or upon some 
masterful passion or personality. In these 
cases the problem of legitimacy, while always 
obstinate, no doubt, is nevertheless capable of 
a somewhat satisfactory solution because of the 
dominance of the narrator-hero, or because of 
the limited range of interests necessary to suc- 
cess. Obviously the novels of Dickens do not 
belong wholly to either of these classes or to 
the type represented by " Roderick Random." 
They seem to be organized according to no rule 
or pattern, are often carelessly organized and 
extended beyond due bounds. With all their 
complexity one expects the problem of legiti- 
mation in " David Copperfield " and " Great 
Expectations " to assume unusual proportions. 
But Dickens is helped by the very looseness of 
his structure. Neither of these novels has a 
scenic plot-centre a scene that brings all the 
personages together in a confusion or a combi- 
nation of interests. The heroes are accordingly 
never obliged to meet many of the persons at 
once, and the connection of scene with scene is 
made largely by their own voluntary acts. 
Moreover, in the structure of the stories there 
are some ragged ends. If the legitimation, 
therefore, is not uncommonly difficult in these 
long and intricate I-novels, this is chiefly be- 
cause Dickens evades it, as he does also in his 
third-person novels. 

One other difference in the structure of the 
two forms of narrative is noticeable. It con- 
sists in the treatment accorded author's com- 
ment. 

Author's comment is a term applied to what- 
ever departs from pure narrative by way either 
of generalization from individual instances, of 
direct address to the reader, or of expression 
of feeling not dramatized in some personage, 
but seen to be the author's own. In the third- 
person novel such reflection or appeal is re- 
garded by some critics as not properly a part 
of the story. However apt it may be, or 
pleasant to the reader, from the standpoint of 
narrative structure it is declared to be an 
excrescence, because it is not objectified in the 
thoughts and acts of the personages but re- 
mains separate and abstract. In any piece of 
fiction, comment closely approaches logically 
the narrative of thoughts much used in modern 
novels as a means of character-analysis. Log- 
ically, this narrative of thoughts is in part the 



14 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



author's comment upon the character he is 
portraying; but structurally it holds a different 
relation to the work from that of the comment 
defined above, because it is objectified and 
individualized, and is thus truly incorporated 
with the narrative. Now the peculiarity of the 
I-form is that it objectifies and incorporates 
all comment by making it the direct utterance 
of the I-narrator. Critics who object to com- 
ment in the third-person form must admit that 
in I-narrative it gains the structural right of 
entrance, because the narrator is present in his 
own story and has full liberty to relate either 
his deeds or his thoughts. In the I-novel, 
accordingly, the relation between narrative of 
thoughts and author's comment in the strict 
sense is sometimes so close as to make the dif- 
ference almost indistinguishable. The differ- 
ence lies, however, so far as it may be perceived 
at all, in the fact of generalization. Author's 
comment becomes objectified, indeed, to the 
extent that it is uttered by the I-narrator ; but 
yet it is only half dramatized, it may still serve 
the author's philanthropic or homiletic purpose, 
it still stops the narrative of events ; it is gen- 
eralized, and thus it has the value of an essay 
or a sermon. If the comment, however, springs 
really from the thoughtful habit of mind in 
the author, the statements just made presup- 
pose some identity between the author and the 
hypothetical narrator. And this fact points to 
what seems to be actually the case, that in 
I-novels wherein there is but slight spiritual 
relationship to the author in stories he has 
told for the sake of spinning a yarn not much 
comment is recognizable as author's reflection. 
Stevenson's stories are an instance. But in all 
I-novels where there is close relationship be- 
tween the author and the narrator, comment may 
be expected and its legitimacy fully granted. 

Nevertheless, the structural incorporation 
thus of author's comment is a two - edged 
weapon. Though greater freedom is thereby 
allowed the author to reflect on life, to discuss 
moral or public questions, than could be easily 
admitted in a third-person novel, yet this same 
freedom tempts him to pass beyond the bounds 
of liveliness or of naturalness. He is tempted, 
if he has at heart some great question, to make 
the I-narrator the mouthpiece of his anxieties 
and his plans to such an extent that the novel 
becomes a tract, a servant of the age without 
permanent artistic value. This is true of 
" Alton Locke." Or, the author is tempted to 
overlay the narrative with such an amount of 
observation and reflection, part of which may 



be inconsistent with the person uttering it, that 
the novel loses its dramatic interest without 
being recompensed by the logical fulness and 
consistency of a treatise. This is illustrated by 
Besant's novel " Dorothy Wallis." The I-nar- 
rator becomes in such cases as these, so far as 
he is a fictitious personage, a victim of the 
author's zeal for humanity, and is immolated 
on the altar of progress. 

Possibly few things furnish a better test of 
the character of a novelist's gift than the fre- 
quency of his comment and the nature of the 
things he says. " Jane Eyre," though it has 
scattered addresses to the reader, is uncom- 
monly free from reflection as a thing apart 
from the body of the story. The nature of the 
work is almost purely narrative. Dickens's 
I-novels show the same slightness of reflection 
as on the whole is usual in his works. His 
gift is not in the direction of thought. The 
same may be said of Smollett. On the other 
hand, Kingsley's book, overloaded with com- 
ment and not ballasted by a dramatic plot, 
proves him a moralist and a preacher quite as 
readily as do his sermons or his fondness for 
quoting Carlyle. " The Vicar of Wakefield," 
perhaps the most truly genial of any of these 
books, is after all weighted with no small amount 
of eighteenth century sententiousness. One or 
two chapters are entirely filled with abstract 
essays, curiously legitimated by being delivered 
as sermons by the Vicar. A similar device is 
used by Kingsley. To Sterne, of course, one 
turns for examples par excellence of comment ; 
since, indeed, the comment in some sense 
vitalizes his work. But in this as in other 
things " Tristram Shandy " illustrates not the 
ordinary workings of the I-structure ; rather 
only some of its peculiarities exaggerated into 
fantastic oddity. Hence, after all, it may be 
said that though I-narrative doubtless in theory 
allows comment, none of the novels here an- 
alyzed, except the two mentioned, makes much 
undue use of the liberty ; and the remark sug- 
gests itself that even an I-novel is an uncertain 
vehicle for social or philosophical disquisition. 

Other characteristics and other forms of 
I-narrative must be studied before positive 
conclusions can be reached concerning its na- 
ture ; perhaps, however, enough has here been 
done to show that the I-form adapts itself with 
remarkable ease either to material intense and 
concentrated in feeling, or to material which, 
subordinating emotion, is flowing and compre- 
hensive in incident.

TRAVELS BY LAND AND SEA.* 

Information about the Pamir region of Cen- 
tral Asia that once terra incognita to the 
north of the Hindu-Kush range poetically 
known as the Roof of the World is now ac- 
cessible in a number of good books written 
from different political view-points. The re- 
gion is a rather tempting one to the explorer 
and the sportsman ; but perhaps its chief in- 
terest just now lies in the fact that it marks 
the point where the jurisdictions of three Em- 
pires, the British, the Russian, and the Chi- 
nese, meet in rivalry although the China- 
man does not seem to count for much there 
as a competitor. 

The latest literary traveller in this debatable 
land of high plateau and towering peak is Mr. 
Ralph P. Cobbold, who records his experiences 
and impressions, and gives vent to some very 
decided opinions, in a handsome volume of 
350 odd pages entitled " Innermost Asia." 
Mr. Cobbold's book is ostensibly and essen- 
tially a story of travel and sport in the Pamirs ; 
but, as a Briton of the strenuous type and an 
ex-officer in the army to boot, he does not let 
slip the opportunity to dilate vigorously on the 
political questions connected with the country 
he visited. It is due to Mr. Cobbold to say 
that a portion of the country he saw has never 
before been viewed by an Englishman, and that 
his enforced detention by Russian officials at 
an outlying post gave him an exceptional op- 
portunity for studying Russian administrative 
methods in newly annexed territory. These 
methods are partly exemplified in the following 
incident :

" One day I had an interesting opportunity of seeing 
how the Russian conquerors treat their subject races. 
I happened to be at the Consulate when an Andijani 
merchant called on some business, and was promptly 
invited to enter. He was treated as an honored guest ; 
the Russian officers chatted with him on terms of inti- 
macy, and to watch him seated in the Consul's private 
room as he partook of tea and fruit one would have 
supposed him to be a cherished friend. The following 
morning I observed the same merchant making a hur- 
ried exit through the Consulate gates, his progress be- 
ing skilfully accelerated by the whips of the Cossacks. 
From inquiries I gathered that the merchant had done 
something of which the Consul-General did not approve, 
or had failed to do something which Petrovsky wished 
him to do." 

Nor do the Russian proconsuls, as it seems, 
hesitate to resort to extreme measures of com- 
pulsion with Chinese officials, even where the 
latter are, with the Russians, in joint control 
of the district. For instance, at Kashgar, the 
resident mandarin, or Taotai, proving stubborn 
on some small point of disagreement, it was 
arranged to lure him into the Consulate under 
the pretence of treating him to a Russian vapor 
bath. A treat of a very different order, how- 
ever, was in store for the learned Confucian 
and representative of the Dragon Throne. It 
was arranged that while the great man was en- 
joying his ablutions he was to be seized by 
four stout Cossacks and soundly whipped until 
his mind was open to a rational, or Russian, 
view of the point in dispute. Thus, as Prince 
Ukhtomsky beautifully says, is the advance of 
Holy Russia in the Orient inspired by her 
motto, " Power lies not in strength, but in love." 

It was on September 13, 1897, that Mr. 
Cobbold set out from Srinagar, by the military 
road through Gilgit and Hunza, on his long- 
planned visit to the Pamirs. After an inter- 
esting and adventurous two-months' journey he 
reached Kashgar, where a rather protracted 
stay furnished him material for a pleasant 
chapter. Vierny, nearly five hundred miles 
distant, was the next considerable halting- 
point, and here the author enjoyed a tiger- 
hunt. We say enjoyed, although at one time 
the tables were very near being turned on Mr. 
Cobbold, the reader being wrought up to a 
pleasing pitch of uncertainty as to whether in 
the end it was going to be the gentleman or 
the tiger. From Vierny Mr. Cobbold returned 
to Kashgar, where he obtained a permit to 
visit the Russian Pamirs. This privilege led 
to an arduous journey and some trying adven- 
tures, as well as to an object-lesson in the 
methods of Russian officials, who detained Mr. 
Cobbold for some time as a prisoner on parole, 
in spite of his permit and his sacrosanct quality

THE DIAL, 



[July 1, 



as a British subject. Freed from the clutches 
of his polite and hospitable but inexorable 
captors (who seem to have regarded him as a 
possible spy), Mr. Cobbold resumed his jour- 
ney in no sentimental mood, and on July 7 
crossed the Chinese frontier, of which he says : 
" I confess that at this part of my journey I felt par- 
ticularly radiant. I had realized my ambition to visit 
the mighty Oxus in that part of its course which is 
quite unknown to Englishmen. I had crossed the dis- 
trict of Roshan, and visited the unknown region of 
Shighnan, which had been closed to Europeans ever 
since they had been under Muscovite dominion. I had 
crossed the Panja and visited the outermost stronghold 
of Afghan power at Kala Bar Fanja, and I had seen 
the inside of the two most outlying Russian strongholds 
in innermost Asia, and I realized that the hardships I 
had met with had not been endured in vain." 

Mr. Cobbold's book will be found both en- 
tertaining and instructive, and must, we think, 
take rank as a standard work of reference on 
the subject. Those who scout its political 
views must admit the value of its descriptions. 
It is handsomely illustrated and well provided 
with maps. 

Mr. John Ward's charmingly illustrated 
volume of travel-sketches from Egypt, entitled 
"Pyramids and Progress," seems almost an 
ideal book for the use of tourists looking Nile- 
wards who wish to make the most of the jour- 
ney in the way of both pleasure and profit. 
As Professor Sayce observes, in his thoughtful 
Introduction, the traveller who would learn all 
that a voyage up the Nile can teach him must 
have the seeing eye and the hearing ear, and 
possess, moreover, the understanding mind; 
and it is for such that Mr. Ward's book is 
written. Mr. Ward has not written as an an- 
tiquarian merely. In his descriptions, infor- 
mation as to the vestiges of ancient Egyptian 
civilizations is judiciously mingled with infor- 
mation as to the Egypt of to-day, the land of 
nascent progress in which Lord Cromer and 
his staff of administrators and engineers are 
working so many wonders. The great works 
of irrigation now in progress, the enormous 
barrages and reservoirs destined to regulate 
the flow, check the waste, and double the area 
of fertilization of the Nile, are fully described. 
Mr. Ward's scholarly and concise book is a 
model one of its kind, and may be cordially 
recommended to the intelligent tourist, and to 
the reader in quest of general information. 

Reading Mr. Charles W. Wood's chatty 
and enthusiastic account of his tour " In the 
Valley of the Rhone" is nearly as good as 
making the trip one's self rather better, in- 



deed, in some regards and for not a few tem- 
peraments. As Schopenhauer says, the ex- 
pression " to enjoy one's self at Paris " instead 
of " to enjoy Paris " is a profoundly accurate 
one. At all events, Mr. Wood clearly has the 
capacity for having an immensely good time, 
as every page of his book attests. For an 
F.R.G.S., he seems a rather sentimental trav- 
eller, and has not, we think, wholly neglected 
the immortal model of the historian of Father 
Lorenzo and the caged starling. But the sug- 
gestion of a model is slight and unobtrusive ; 
and of good set description and nuggets of ac- 
tual information in the guide-book way there is 
no lack. Mr. Wood's starting-point was Mon- 
treux, in the upper, or Swiss, Rhone valley ; 
and his itinerary for this region embraced the 
best towns of the cantons of Vaud and Valais 
Territet, Caux, Chillon, Sion, St. Maurice, 
Martigny, Orsieres, Liddes, Geneva. The St. 
Bernard Hospice was visited, of course. The 
lower or French valley was "done" in leisurely 
fashion. From Lyons a delightful excursion 
by train and diligence was made to the Au- 
vergne district. Aries was made the rallying- 
point for a series of delightful jaunts, and Mr. 
Wood does not omit the customary tribute to 
the fair Arlesiennes. 

" Fair women ? They are indeed fair women. We 
had long heard of the charm of the Arldsiennes. but 
our imagination fell short of the truth. We never an- 
ticipated such a galaxy of beauty beauty of a noble 
and splendid type. They are said to have retained the 
old Roman type of the earlier centuries, and apparently 
it is so. In no other way can one explain the phenom- 
enon for it is nothing less than a wonder." 

A trip to Aries is evidently well worth while. 
Les Baux, Mont Major, St. Remy, La Ca- 
margue, St. Gilles, Aignes-Mortes, Avignon, 
Villeneuve, St. Peray, Vienne, were visited 
and explored, with pleasant results. In short, 
Mr. Wood's book is an exceptionally lively 
and readable one, with a due savor of litera- 
ture and scholarship, and an element of decided 
interest and charm in the eighty-eight artistic 
drawings that enrich it. 

In Mr. W. Anderson Smith's " Temperate 
Chile " will be found a rather severely critical 
yet friendly and impartial account of that en- 
ergetic and combative little state, its people, 
politics, resources, customs, and geographical 
features. The book is soberly written, and 
with a view to the instruction rather than en- 
tertainment of the reader, being filled with 
solid information and carefully drawn conclu- 
sions. Mr. Smith evidently believes in the 



1900.J 



THE DIAL 



future prosperity and political stability of Chile, 
though things are at present in a rather raw and 
inchoate condition. Intemperance is common, 
and homicides are shockingly frequent. 

" When a large bottle of very strong and fiery alco- 
holic spirit can be bought for about sixpence, and living 
is otherwise cheap, the natural consequence is a large 
consumption. . . . Scarcely a day passes in Santiago 
without two or three murders; and it is commonly as- 
serted and believed that 1,500 to 1,800 men are annu- 
ally victims of violence between Valparaiso and San- 
tiago." 

Chile is as yet but nominally republican, many 
of the old semi-aristocratic or oligarchic au- 
thorities and abuses having, in point of fact, 
survived the Revolution, and a more or less 
vicious and ignorant priesthood still blights 
the minds and morals of the people. 

" In place of a fresh new republican tree we have a 
weak republican graft on the old oligarchy, that re- 
mains still largely in evidence. The wealth seized from 
Peru has aggravated rather than relieved the situation. 
It has increased the number of parasites removed from 
the possible workers in the more beneficial paths of in- 
dustry and commerce. Like a hive of bees that has 
robbed its neighbor, Chile is in danger of becoming a 
nation of professional thieves, rather than steady devel- 
opers of its undoubtedly valuable resources. ... A 
restraining and modifying influence is, however, ap- 
parent in all the growing centres of population. The 
educated and struggling middle class is increasing at a 
far greater ratio than the lower, with which insanitary 
surroundings and ways of life, aided by the knife and 
aguardiente, wage continual and effective war. The 
public press is outspoken and increasingly liberal, edu- 
cation advancing on sound lines, and every act of gov- 
ernment criticized keenly and discussed with heat in 
every bar and cafe." 

Those in need of solid information as to Chile's 
present condition and her outlook should not 
neglect Mr. Smith's book. It has an index 
and a good map. 

On June 16, 1897, the steamer " Excelsior," 
of the Alaska Commercial Company, steamed 
to her dock near the foot of Market Street, 
San Francisco ; and that night the wires flashed 
over the country the news that a part of her 
cargo was $750,000 in gold-dust, an earnest of 
what was going to prove the richest " strike " 
in all American mining history. On June 17, 
another boat, the " Portland," reached Seattle, 
bringing 8800,000 more of what newspaper 
economists and stump orators call the " yellow 
metal "; and the Coast was presently " gold 
crazy " once more. The rush to the Klondike 
began. On the 28th of July Messrs. Harper 
& Brothers of New York commissioned a corre- 
spondent to go to Dawson to procure news and 
pictures of the gold-fields. Mr. Tappan Adney 
was the one chosen for the work ; and on July 



30 he started for the West, specially equipped 
with one year's photographic outfit. Arrived 
at the scene of operations, Mr. Adney plunged 
manfully into the thick of the fray, doing at 
the Klondike as the Klondikers did, and study- 
ing in all its phases the life at the new Eldo- 
rado. The literary and pictorial result of his 
expedition is embodied in a comely volume of 
nearly five hundred pages, entitled "The Klon- 
dike Stampede." It is a racy and graphic 
book, full of hints and counsels for the tyro, 
in which one may view through the eyes of a 
keen observer the Klondike drama in its pecu- 
liar phases. Social life, we learn, adorned and 
softened by the presence of the fair sex, was 
not lacking at Dawson. Indeed, there was a 
good deal of it. It centred at a dance-hall 
known as " Pete's," the fashionable Almack's 
of the place. Its presiding genius, after 
"Pete" himself, was the "caller-off," a strenu- 
ous and voluble young man whose function it 
was to keep the fun going, and, incidentally, 
the whiskey flowing. Bashful " gents " with 
the wall-flower habit were urged into action, 
and economical "gents" were shamed into 
bursts of prodigality. When the music struck 
up, the exhorter began : 

" ' Come on boys you can all waltz let's have a 
nice, long, juicy waltz;' and then, when three or four 
couples had taken the floor . . . the fun began. . . . 
Hardly had the dancers stopped before the caller-off, 
upon whose skill in keeping the dances going depended 
the profits of the house, began again in his loud voice, 
coaxing, imploring ' Come on boys,' or, < Grab a 
lady, boys, V have a nice quadrille.' And so it went on 
all night, one hundred and twenty-five dances being not 
unusual before daylight appeared through the frosted 
panes." 

"Grabbing" a lady involved treating her at 
the bar after the dance was over ; and so, with 
whiskey at a dollar a drink and champagne at 
forty dollars a bottle, the "pokes," or gold- 
sacks, of the miners grew lean rapidly, while 
the coffers of "Pete" waxed fat. Mr. Adney's 
vivacious book gives a satisfactory view of the 
Klondike movement of 1897-98, and the pic- 
tures are as good as the text. 

Miss Margaret W. Morley's fresh and ex- 
hilarating account of her leisurely summer 
jaunt in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island 
deserves a more graceful title than "Down 
North and Up Along." Miss Morley visited 
in turn Digby, Grand Pre, Blomidon, Part- 
ridge Island, Halifax, Baddeck, Englishtown, 
Igonish, etc., and she paints what she saw in a 
style that is refreshingly straightforward and 
unaffected. Miss Morley has the sense of 



18 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



humor, as the following picture of " Tommy 
Atkins," as seen at Halifax, may attest: 

" Their presence is decorative, but individually these 
soldiers are not very impressive. Many of them are 
certainly round-shouldered; and with their bright red 
coats and tiny round caps perched on an angle of the 
head and held in place by straps under the chin, they 
look so irresistibly like the long-tailed gentleman who 
sits on the hand-organ and doffs his cap for pennies, 
that it is difficult to contemplate them with the respect 
due to their glorious calling." 

So much for the units of the historic " thin 
red line." Miss Morley's book is a capital one 
with which to while away the sultry hours of a 
summer holiday. 

Miss E. M. Merrick is a London artist, and 
portraits are her specialty ; but she has made 
some creditable excursions into the field of 
genre painting, in the illustrative or narrative 
English style. While still a student at the 
Koyal Academy, Miss Merrick made a trip to 
Egypt; and there, though mainly on pleasure 
bent, she found time to secure and begin sev- 
eral commissions, notably portraits of the 
Khedivia and of Mr. H. M. Stanley. These 
successes turned Miss Merrick's thoughts to 
the Orient as a promising field of operations ; 
and a professional foray into India followed. 
The memories of these expeditions are now 
printed in a pretty little volume entitled "With 
a Palette in Eastern Palaces," which has a cer- 
tain special descriptive value owing to the fact 
that its author, in her capacity of portrait- 
painter, was often permitted to penetrate into 
places that are closed to most tourists in- 
deed, to all masculine visitors whomsoever. 
The book presents many lively pictures of East 
Indian society and manners, native and exotic ; 
and it is written with true feminine vivacity. It 
contains some interesting reproductions of por- 
traits painted in the East by the author ; but 
quite the most attractive thing in it is the 
frontispiece portrait of Miss Merrick herself. 
While in Egypt, Miss Merrick met some 
American tourists. 

" I remember one remarking to me when I was feel- 
ing rather seedy at Assouan, ' Wai, you do look like a 
worm. Guess Egypt don't suit you. You'll go home 
in a box likely.' American expressions sound very 
funny to our ears." 

We should think so. American readers will 
regret that Miss Merrick fails to say what 
section of this country the expressions quoted 
are native to. 

" Ivory Apes and Peacocks " is the suffi- 
ciently bizarre title of a sheaf of East Indian 
travel-pictures by that pleasantly fantastical 



essayist and virtuoso of irridescent phrases, 
" Israfel." To the travel-pictures are added a 
half-dozen rhapsodic little papers on themes 
musical and literary " The Musical Critic," 
" Rudyard Kipling," " Music and Literature," 
etc. Other titles are, " Peninsular and Ori- 
ental," " Bombay," " Agra," The Taj Ma- 
hal," "Delhi," "Benares," "Calcutta," and 
so on. " Israfel " is essentially a stylist, an 
executant of brilliant verbal fantasias ; and we 
are not to look to him for statistics, or for a 
British tax-payer's views on the Indian budget. 
He has a curious trick of wilful bathos, of 
checking a flight of parti-colored words with a 
homely and even a relatively vulgar allusion. 
A rhapsody on the Taj Mahal is thus cut short 
by the memory of the grateful effect of a glass 
of whiskey on a chilly night : 

"I went to see the Taj by moonlight (oh! the trite- 
ness of the phrase!) a full moon. The night was 
such a one as you might spend ' with Saadi in the gar- 
den,' breathless and tropical, the flower scents rose as 
incense straight to Heaven, the gleaming tanks were 
sheets of shadowy silver, and musical with frogs. The 
Taj shone, peerless as a swan on a lake, in the sky of 
dusky amethyst, a palace of pearl pierced by soft, un- 
fathomable glooms. ... I cannot express the Un- 
reality, the Ideality, of the Taj that night. Standing 
but a few paces from its ghostly loveliness, I felt that 
it was a vision, impalpable, unattainable ; I thought of 
Epipsychidion,' I thought of Heine's Ewig verlor'nes 
LiebJ I thought of the whiskey-peg I should have when 
I got home for the night was a cold one." 

Asked to describe the Taj Mahal, the author's 
uncle said that it was " a very nice place." 
Perhaps he would have reserved his enthusi- 
asm for the whiskey-peg. Readers who care 
for " Israfel " at all will like this his latest 
volume very much. 

We have read with much relish the seven- 
teen papers contained in Mr. Richard Le Gal- 
lienne's pretty volume entitled " Travels in 
England," and shall certainly re-read some of 
them the specially pleasant ones on Win- 
terslow and Stratford, for example. Mr. Le 
Gallienne went to Winterslow as to the one time 
home or lair, one may say of Hazlitt ; and 
he went to Stratford to see Madame Bernhardt 
play "Hamlet." These facts mark the drift 
and tenor of the two papers. Other places 
visited were Selborne, Winchester, Sarum, 
Stonehenge, Avebury, Lechlade, Kelmscott, 
Cirencester, the Cotswold's. Let us add that 
the season was summer, and Mr. Le Gallienne 
travelled a-wheel. Mr. Herbert Railton's half- 
dozen dainty drawings harmonize nicely with 
the general character of this sprightly and 
pretty book. E. G. J.

THINGS OUT OF DOORS.* 



" By the time July is well started," observes 
the gentle author of " Friends Worth Know- 
ing," in his newer work, " Nature's Calendar," 
" the rains have ceased, the woods are deep in 
the shadow of completed leafage and growing 
twigs, the soil is dry and is throwing out an 
increasing crop of curious agarics, and walking 
in the dusty roads or open uplands is unpleas- 
ant. Naturally enough, then, we turn in our 
rambles towards the watercourses and seek to 
read the ' books in the running brooks.' " Mr. 
Ingersoll does not say, as he could have said, 
that the opening of July is the very crown and 
summit of the year ; nor could he have known 
that this year of grace, 1900, finds it a most 
exceptional time for seeing the outdoor world 
at its very best, abundant and early rains and 
moderate temperatures having given promise 
of a July that does not need to have its face 
washed for the dust upon it. 

It is truly a time and a season in which to 
observe the real beauties of this earth of ours, 
so far removed from the political turmoil in 
which that country is about to plunge. Nor 
should we, unless we know them thoroughly, 
neglect the lessons that are to be gained from 
so charming an assortment of books as have 
been provided for summer instruction and en- 
tertainment. " Nature's Calendar " is a book 
for the year, containing on its broad pages " a 
slender rivulet of text " of much charm and 
pertinency, while beside and under it is a space 
of white marked for every day of the year, 
whereon notes may be made to supplement the 
observations of the author. But it is a calen- 
dar in another sense as well, for at the end of 
each of the months is set forth such a summary 
of the habits of live things, birds, reptiles, 
fishes, and insects, that the least observant can 
load himself with hints to make obvious and 
familiar at least a part of a world before invis-

Beautifully printed on paper which leaves 
one vexed that glazed surfaces have ever been 
tolerated, with nearly a hundred illustrations 
by Mr. Oliver Kemp to interpret the thought 
in another medium, Dr. Charles C. Abbott's 
" In Nature's Realm " is a book to be treas- 
ured. Serenely philosophical, keenly observant, 
intellectually suggestive, the placid marshalling 
of the less obvious facts of nature, with their 
gentle spiritual interpretation from Dr. Ab- 
bott's pen to make us all human together, is a 
real triumph of literature. He discusses, to 
take one example from scores, " My Point of 
View," and his breadth is made ours if we read 
him aright when he says : 

" I am what I am to nature, not what another, from 
his point of view, judges I should be. I am a part of 
nature and nature is a part of me. Tear us apart, and 
nature is robbed and I am ruined. Hence the futility 
of attempting radical changes; for nations and coun- 
tries and climates have their peculiar points of view, 
and the Christianized pagan is still but a pagan Chris- 
tianized. His idol may be a fraud, but it will never 
cease to be his idol. The outward sign of respect may 
be withheld, but the inward feeling of regard can never 
die. Who has seen the world with another's eyes? 
There is a cuttle-fish that can blacken the waters about 
it until the animal disappears, but the water is water 
still, and the animal is only hidden, not changed nor 
annihilated. The oak does not ask the elm to change 
its leaves, nor roses red taunt the violets because they 
are blue, why then seek to change my point of view 
and blur the landscape that to me is beautiful and so a 
joy forever ? The intensity of a personality that 
dwarfs others is more likely to prove a curse than a 
blessing. My limited individuality has its place and is 
not benefitted by shifting it from its bearings. Nature 
is a better director than man in this regard." 

There is much more of this delightful and hu- 
mane philanthropy, which contrasts so abruptly 
with the turmoil and warfare of the world 
due chiefly, it may be remarked, to the fact 
that we are not satisfied with burghers as 
burghers, Filipinos as Filipinos, or Mongols as 
Mongols, but are madly seeking to make them 
British, or American, or Caucasian, as the case 
may be. When the world has learned, like 
Dr. Abbott, that a man's point of view is his 
own, and that he is accountable for it to God 
alone, we shall all of us be in a fair way of 
being civilized, instead of merely thinking our- 
selves so.

notice at this time, since the new edition an- 
nounces itself the fifty-sixth thousand. It dif- 
fers from its predecessors by the inclusion of 
forty-eight colored plates after the water-color 
sketches by Miss Elsie Louise Shaw, uncolored 
pictures of the same flowers contained in for- 
mer editions being omitted here, and almost as 
many new ones being added from the faithful 
flower portraits of Miss Marion Satterlee. The 
text stands as it did seven years ago, and the 
book in its present form leaves little to be de- 
sired. 

Miss Alice Lounsberry's " Guide to the 
Trees " and Mrs. Harriet L. Keeler's " Our 
Native Trees " differ chiefly in the personal 
equation of the two writers. Both give, with 
all the fulness desirable, the means whereby 
component members of American forests can 
be distinguished one from another, and their 
names ascertained with the least amount of 
trouble. In addition to this groundwork, which 
includes a complete description of the tree in 
all its details, bark, leaves, flowers, and 
fruit, Miss Lounsberry's book contains a 
great number of colored and black-and-white 
pictures and diagrams made by Mrs. Ellis 
Rowan, and a brief introduction by Dr. N. L. 
Britton. Mrs. Keeler's work is illustrated by 
reproductions of photographs direct from na- 
ture, most of them of leaves and fruit, but with 
many drawings of details. It is a work which 
is less formal than the other, and with more of 
the literary quality. Quite as instructive, it 
sets forth the technicalities in popular language, 
while the photographs of leaves serve a better 
purpose in the process of identification. Either 
of the books is a desirable addition to the 
library. 

Mr. Charles A. Keeler is already well known 
for his delightful writings after the manner of 
a Californian Thoreau, and "Bird Notes 
Afield " will enhance his reputation both as a 
man of letters and of science. He deals with 
the birds of the Pacific coast more particularly, 
and his statement of the differences and re- 
semblances of these with the feathered folk of 
regions nearer the rising sun makes very de- 
lightful reading. Many of his studies have 
been made in the vicinity of Berkeley, for 
which the pleasant book of Miss Eva V. Car- 
lin, published more than a year ago, serves as 
an introduction. He tells of the domestic life 
of the hummingbird, as follows : 

"If you have the good fortune to have discovered 
an unfinished nest, you may observe the mother bird's 
methods of work. She settles upon it and rounds it 



with her breast. Seemingly with difficulty the head is 
raised and the long, slender beak arranges here and 
there a bit of lichen, bark, or cobweb in its proper place 
on the outside. Thus she works until the compact little 
structure of softest thistledown, covered on the outside 
with small fragments of moss, lichen, bark, and similar 
materials, is ready to receive the invariable two white 
eggs. In due course of time the most helpless young 
imaginable are hatched, to be tended with unremitting 
care. They soon grow so large that their diminutive 
home can scarcely contain them until, at last, from the 
sheer physical necessity of overcrowded quarters, they 
are forced to essay a flight. Wonderful, indeed, is the 
domestic life of these smallest of birds, in whose minute 
frame is compacted so much of intelligence and passion 
so much that we fondly claim as human." 

In abrupt contrast with this may be taken the 
paper on "Patrolling the Beach," in which 
nature in her most ferocious aspect, after a 
storm at sea, is followed in her work of devas- 
tation. The book, which is most alluringly 
designed, concludes with a key whereby the 
various birds of California may be differenti- 
ated and identified, the arrangement being 
such that no scientific knowledge is required 
for its use. 

" Bird Homes," by Mr. Radclyffe Dugmore, 
is such a book as every lover of birds must 
welcome, since it really admits the reader into 
the privacy of their family life. It is, more- 
over, an eloquent plea for acquaintance with 
our tiny neighbors as the best means of pre- 
serving them from the cruelties which make us 
ashamed of the name of human. One or two 
of the instances Mr. Dugmore cites are quite 
too harrowing for repetition here. But such a 
paragraph as this is worth taking to heart : 

" I think any woman who had seen a mother-thrush 
on the nest, with her anxious, wild little eyes looking 
out in fear of the intruder, could never again wear a 
stuffed bird as a hat ornament, to be used for a short 
month or two and then thrown away. For herein lies, 
perhaps, the chief cause of the partial extermination of 
our birds, both those that are sombre in color (for they 
can be dyed to any desired shade) and those that are 
by nature of brilliant hues. And who gains by this 
cruel sacrifice to a heartless fashion save the dealers ? " 

A similar warning is addressed to the boy who 
begins an egg collection. Instructions are 
given which will enable the eggs to be taken 
without inflicting the birds with calamity, but 
a still stronger argument is made for observing 
the conduct of the young when hatched. It is 
to descriptions of this sort, admirably illus- 
trated by instantaneous photographs in repro- 
duction of the birds, old and young, in various 
stages of home building and family rearing, 
that the book is chiefly devoted ; and no better 
argument for the use of a camera instead of a

gun could be desired than these very pictures. 
Emerson's lines are his text : 

" Have you numbered all the birds of the wood, 

Without a gun ? 
Have you loved the wild rose 

And left it on its stalk ? 
be my friend, and teach me to be thine." 

Not only does the book abound in photographic 
reproductions, many of them in color, but there 
are several plates of eggs which will give the 
reader most of the advantages of a collection 
without the possibility of inflicting misery upon 
the small friends whom self-interest no less than 
humanity urges us to protect. Mr. Dugmore 
is to be congratulated on the execution of his 
gentle and pious task. 

Of even greater interest than the book just 
noticed is Mr. F. M. Chapman's pleasant 
narrative of " Bird Studies with a Camera." 
Mr. Chapman is the first American to discern 
the advantages which the exceedingly clever 
book of the Messrs. Kearton, " Wild Life at 
Home," held out to those happy folk who are 
amateurs in both photography and ornithology. 
Though his book is not so ambitious as his 
disciple's, it covers more ground, and ground 
of another sort, without being quite so detailed. 
The two works, taken together, will form a 
course both elementary and advanced in the 
pleasant application of the two sciences of 
which it treats. Mr. Chapman has been along 
the Atlantic coast and to the islands in the 
St. Lawrence in search of subjects, and he dis- 
courses on pelicans and plovers with the ease 
which Mr. Dugmore bestows on bobolinks and 
blackbirds. Nests and eggs play their part 
with both, and so do the facts about lenses and 
hyposulphites ; Mr. Chapman being more spe- 
cific in respect to the latter. 

So ends a charming task, most amiably suited 
to the crowning season of the year. Insects 
and flowers, butterflies and roses, birds and 
trees, fields and rivers, these are surely among 
the loveliest things on earth.

three pages of bibliography, this edition has no special

RECEXT FICTION.* 

Those readers to whom " The Choir Invisible " 
came as a revelation of strength allied with tender- 
ness, of spiritual beauty made one with the beauty 
of the visible world, have been eagerly awaiting 
further work from the pen of Mr. James Lane 
Allen. Mr. Allen takes his time about writing, 
and two years have gone to the composition of his 
new book, " The Reign of Law." We are thus as- 
sured in advance of his usual careful workmanship, 
and we open his new volume with the most pleas- 
urable anticipations. These anticipations are not 
doomed to disappointment, for the work, considered 
primarily as a piece of literature, proves to be sat- 
isfying in a high degree. Those who care less for 
the graces of style and for the exhibition of elevated 
emotions than they care for a story apart from these 
adjuncts, will perhaps suffer some slight disappoint- 
ment when they discover that " The Reign of Law" 
is little more than an account of the struggles of an 
untutored country lad to win his spiritual emanci- 
pation. He is presented as an extremely sympa- 
thetic figure, but the story of his life has few inci- 
dents save those which are connected with his 
endeavor to secure an education, and with his eager 
quest for the higher forms of truth. All sorts of 
obstacles confront him as his mind gropes toward 
the light, and his spiritual freedom is gained at a 
great price. Living in an atmosphere of sectarian- 
ism and narrow religious bigotry, he finds his way 
unaided to the high intellectual plane of the great 
modern thinkers who have so transformed our 
primitive conceptions of the relation between man 
and the universe. The dogmatic influences which 
would impede his growth to full intellectual stature 
are successfully resisted, and be works out in his

own experience that sublime conception of the reign 
of law which has been the chief philosophical 
achievement of our age, and which dwarfs all the 
theological counsels, darkened by words without 
knowledge, of the past. Those who can match in 
their own experience the intellectual struggles of 
this youth will understand the author's purpose ; 
for those who cannot bring to their reading as 
much as they take from it, " The Reign of Law " 
will be a sealed book. That it should become widely 
popular we do not deem probable; its interest is 
too special for that, and its direct appeal is made 
to the audience that is never a large one in any age. 
The gospel of easy comfortable acceptance of what- 
ever ideas are held by those around us, the gospel 
which is content to exalt for worship the idols of 
our own particular tribe or forum is more wide- 
spread in its influence than the gospel of those rare 
and strenuous spirits to whom Mr. Allen's hero be- 
longs. To such lives there always attaches the 
pathos of loneliness, of the sympathy that yearns 
for a response but does not find it, and this aspect 
of the struggle is presented with deep poignancy by 
Mr. Allen. The scene of the story is laid in Ken- 
tucky, in the sixties, and it is described as " A Tale 
of the Kentucky Hemp Fields." This must be men- 
tioned, because the processes connected with the 
cultivation of hemp play an important part in the 
narrative. The landscape is colored by the vivid 
green of the hemp, its fragrance fills the air, and 
the soul of the hero is strong as with the strength 
of its fibre. In fact, hemp plays the part of a 
Leitmotiv, if there be such a thing in fiction, 
throughout the book, and, if the symbolism of its 
use appears somewhat labored in the earlier chap- 
ters, the writer in the end compels us to accept it 
as an essential part of his artistic scheme. We 
fancy that we do not err in ascribing to Mr. Allen 
himself that "Song of the Hemp" which is intro- 
duced near the end, and credited to "A minor 
Kentucky writer." It is an exquisite piece of 
verse, and we must find room for one of the four 
stanzas. 

" Oh, dim, dim autumn days of sobbing rain 

When on the fields the ripened hemp is spread 

And woods are brown. 
No land, no land like this for mortal pain 

When Love stands weeping by the sweet, sweet bed 
For Love cut down." 

Mr. Allen is half a poet even in his prose, and 
the transition to and from these verses is accom- 
plished without a jar. It is by his poetic charm 
that he has won our hearts, by that, and by his in- 
tense realization of some of our deepest moods, of 
some of our most spiritual aspirations. 

It is difficult to say anything in praise of " An 
Angel of Clay." Mr. Partridge is an excellent 
sculptor, but a poor writer of fiction. He has no 
control whatever over his medium, and words re- 
fuse to do his artistic bidding. He has produced a 
series of the veriest lay figures in this novel; all of 
them use the same stiff and unnatural forms of 
speech, and not one of them has a spark of vitality. 



He has a message of fine idealism to deliver a 
message that he has delivered successfully in marble 
and in bronze that he might deliver successfully 
in the form of the essay; but his attempt to set it 
forth in a work of fiction is a hopeless failure. If 
the reader will forego the expectation of finding a 
story in this book, and be content to view it as a 
series of thoughtful disquisitions upon art and life, 
he will not, however, go wholly unrewarded. 

Mr. Chambers has so unusual a gift for romantic 
fiction that it is a pity he does not take greater 
pains with his work. The two stories which he has 
recently published are in a way exasperating, be- 
cause, good as they are, they might have been very 
much better. The reckless fashion of slinging his 
materials together, and relying upon his vigor and 
poetic exuberance for an effect, seems to be grow- 
ing upon this brilliant writer. Such slapdash 
methods of composition as are exemplified in " The 
Cambric Mask " and " The Conspirators " betoken 
a sad neglect of the writer's opportunities, and 
make the reader extremely impatient. Both the 
stories are interesting, as a matter of course Mr. 
Chambers always contrives to be that but neither 
of them gives us the satisfaction that we get from 
reasonably finished work. " The Cambric Mask " 
is a story of rural New York, and derives its inter- 
est from the attempt of a gang of whitecaps to 
intimidate and drive away from the region a gen- 
tleman who has come thither for the innocent pur- 
pose of entomological research. His entomology 
is not the cause of offense, but the fact that the 
land which he occupies has suddenly acquired great 
commercial value, and the other fact that he takes 
a too obvious interest in the impossible village 
beauty who figures as the heroine. When aroused 
to a sense of the dangers that threaten him, the 
hero turns out to be anything but the peaceable 
naturalist for whom he is taken. Being an old 
West Pointer, his fighting instincts are aroused, his 
strategy proves equal to his courage, and he routs 
his enemies in the most approved melodramatic 
fashion. Incidentally, he wins the impossible hero- 
ine, after her drunken, and in another sense impos- 
sible, father has been conveniently disposed of, 
and the romance ends in the conventional way. 
" The Conspirators " takes us to a very different 
field of action. The scene is the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg, and the period some imagined future 
time when the German Emperor is upon the point 
of annexing the territory that seems to lie defense- 
less within his grasp. His plans are thwarted, 
partly by the unexpected vigor with which Holland 
opposes the scheme, and partly by the fact that the 
United States, in its new character as a world 
power, takes a hand in the affair. The hero is an 
exaggerated young American, having a diplomatic 
appointment in the Duchy, and getting into all sorts 
of scrapes and entanglements. There are really 
two heroines, one of them being the fictitious and 
picquant countess whom the hero sets himself to 
win, the other being no less a personage than the

THE DIAL 



actual Queen of Holland, for the audacity of the 
writer goes so far as to make him invent a romantic 
attachment between the fair Wilhelmina and a 
prince of the German Empire. The book gives us 
a really charming picture of Luxembourg, both the 
drowsy capital and its wild surroundings, and 
nature, as viewed by the poetic imagination of the 
writer, counts for no small part of the interest of 
the story. 

The extent to which women are of late taking 
possession of the field of historical fiction must 
seem somewhat alarming to writers of the sterner 
sex. That women should vie with them in the de- 
lineation of sentiment and passion seems natural 
enough, but that women should also seek to vie with 
them in tales of battle and adventure seems at first 
sight an unwarrantable intrusion upon the natural 
prerogative of man. But the fact must be faced 
that women are taking more and more to the work 
of historical romance, and that some of them, at 
least, are doing the work in a highly successful 
manner. It is a little late to be speaking about 
" To Have and to Hold," Miss Mary Johnston's 
second novel, for the work attracted widespread 
attention when its first chapters appeared serially 
a year ago, and the completed book has been in the 
hands of readers for a number of weeks. But the 
book is so exceptionally good, and its great popular 
success so well deserved, that in giving it a few 
words of belated praise we have no fear of being taken 
to task for recalling attention to a forgotten book. 
Like Miss Johnston's "Prisoners of Hope," the 
new romance is a tale of colonial Virginia, and 
interest is divided between the natural conditions 
of life in the colony and its relations with the 
mother country. Miss Johnston has a pretty inven- 
tion and an even prettier style. Exciting adventures 
and hairbreadth escapes follow one another in be- 
wildering succession, and the attention is ever alert. 
Crafty Indians and picturesque villains share the 
interest of the story with hero and heroine. There 
is even a pirate crew, a shipwreck, and a desert 
island. Of hero and heroine we may say that both 
are of the type dear to romantic souls ; the one is 
strong, resourceful, and courageous, the other is 
alternately haughty and tender, and always ador- 
ably feminine. Over the whole romance there is 
a slight cast of melodrama, and there is dis- 
played a little less of originality than in the story 
which first attracted readers to Miss Johnston. In 
both books her knowledge of Indian ways is re- 
markable, and her understanding of Indian charac- 
ter has a degree of subtlety which even surpasses 
what we find in Cooper. And in both books the 
reader will linger longest over the many lovely 
pages which describe the Virginian wilds, the hills, 
the rivers, and the solemn solitudes of the forest. 
In this aspect of her work, Miss Johnston is almost 
comparable with Miss Murfree, but fails to attain 
to quite the spiritual elevation of that writer in her 
contemplation of nature. With Miss Johnston, the 
natural surroundings are always accessories of the 



narrative ; with Miss Murfree, on the other hand, 
they are invested with a life and meaning of their 
own. 

" Mary Paget," by Miss Minna Caroline Smith, 
is a slight and amateurish romance of Bermuda in 
the days when Englishmen first settled in the Sum- 
mer Islands, and when the tales of returning mar- 
iners fired the imagination of Shakespeare, and 
became transmuted into the " rich and strange " 
poetry of " The Tempest." Miss Smith is auda- 
cious enough to introduce the poet himself into her 
story, the scene of which remains in England until 
we are half way through the book. Her romance 
is in no way forceful, but it is written in a pleasing 
manner, and it seems to be based upon a careful 
study of the pertinent historical materials. 

It is with modern rather than with colonial Vir- 
ginia that "The Voice of the People," by Miss 
Ellen Glasgow, is concerned. This is Miss Glas- 
gow's third novel, and it is thus far distinctly her 
best. Beginning with a charming description of 
an old Virginian town, which has been left side- 
tracked in the march of modern civilization, and is 
none the less interesting for that, we are at once 
introduced to the hero, an unprepossessing child of 
humble parentage, who has the intellectual instinct, 
and who is determined to raise himself above the 
level of his surroundings. The book is essentially 
the story of this child's career, as he painfully ac- 
quires an education, becomes a successful lawyer, 
enters politics, and is chosen Governor of the Com- 
monwealth. He illustrates that type of American 
manhood of which Lincoln is the great historical 
exemplar, and of which Mr. Ford's Peter Stirling 
is a striking example in fiction, the type of sturdy 
honesty and downright manliness which our country 
is still capable of illustrating from time to time, and 
without which our prospects would indeed be hope- 
less. There are numerous minor characters in this 
book, carefully studied and agreeably diversified, 
who add materially to the interest, but the figure 
of Nicholas Burr rises predominant above them all, 
and it is with his personal fortunes that we have 
chiefly to do. In the end, the story rises to the 
height of tragedy, and the hero, now Governor of 
the State, sacrifices his life in defending the honor 
of the Commonwealth. A negro has been guilty of 
a nameless crime, and a lynching party has been 
organized. The governor comes unexpectedly upon 
the scene of action, opposes the lawless fury of the 
mob, and, before he has been recognized, is mor- 
tally wounded by a shot. "And he died for a 
damned brute," is the comment of a bystander 
when the sobered mob learns what it has done. 
But even in the most brutish of that mob there 
must have been some dim recognition, in the lesson 
thus sharply brought home to them, of the shame of 
their assault upon the majesty of law, and of the 
noble cause for which their victim had given his life. 
Shocking as was the murder, it was less shocking 
and less permanently demoralizing than the success 
of their lawless undertaking would have been. In

describing this scene, the author rises to the true 
dignity of the situation, and leaves a deep impres- 
sion upon the minds of her readers. We have to 
thank her for a strong book, and for a message of 
practical idealism which cannot be weighed too 
seriously. 

An interesting subject and honest workmanship 
combined are sufficient to make a good book, if not 
exactly a strong one. This is what we are offered 
by Miss Caroline Brown's " Knights in Fustian," a 
story of Indiana in the time of the Civil War. The 
secret organization of the Knights of the Golden 
Circle forms the theme of this very readable story, 
which is based upon a careful study of the ramifi- 
cations of their conspiracy, and of the thwarting of 
their plans by the firmness and vigilance of the 
great War Governor of the State. Although Gov- 
ernor Morton does not figure largely in person, he is, 
in a sense, the real hero of this book, which is essen- 
tially a tribute to his masterful management of the 
difficulty occasioned by the treasonable conspiracy 
in question. The writer truthfully says that " we 
of a later generation can hardly credit the extent of 
the organization, and the heinousness of its aims, 
which included crime and the disruption of the 
Union." As a description of this interesting epi- 
sode in the history of the war the book is distinctly 
successful, and to the interest of this theme private 
interests are subordinated, although the story itself 
is not without a certain amount of action and of 
skilful characterization. 

Readers of " The New Antigone " and " The 
Two Standards," having discovered that a Catholic 
priest may be as good a novelist as anybody else, 
will turn to " Arden Massiter," Dr. Barry's third 
work of fiction, with something like enthusiastic 
anticipation. Nor will they be disappointed, for 
the new novel is the best of the three, one of the 
best novels, in fact, that have appeared for many a 
day. It is not such a novel of tendency as its pre- 
decessors were ; it is rather a brilliant picture of life 
in modern Italy, dramatic in manner rather than 
reflective, straightforward rather than discursive, 
and intensely interesting from first to last. The 
variety of its interest is such as to appeal to many 
tastes. Those who ask for nothing more than a 
story will find one of the most thrilling sort, a story 
of subterranean Italy, with its brigands, anarchists, 
and Camorristi, a story of adventure and intrigue, 
a story of conspiracies and abductions and romantic 
passions. Those who ask more of a book than this 
will find their account likewise. They will find 
vivid and artistic delineations of character, im- 
pressive dramatic situations, that sense of the his- 
torical past which is a product of the ripest culture, 
and that insight into contemporaneous conditions 
which betokens close and intelligent observation. 
And all these things find expression in a style so 
admirable, so distinctly the writer's own, so terse 
and direct when occasion requires, so measured and 
poetical when opportunity permits, that interest in 
the mere story is everywhere accompanied by the 



feeling that the book is much more than a story, 
that it belongs to a high and rare order of litera- 
ture. 

Miss M. Imlay Taylor is the author of a growing 
series of historical novels in which, whether she 
takes for her subject imperial Russia or revolution- 
ary America, the England of Thomas Cromwell or 
the France of Cardinal Richelieu, she succeeds in 
combining entertainment with a reasonable modicum 
of instruction. Her manner is facile, she has an 
instinct for effective points, and she constructs a 
plot with no little skill. Her latest novels are " The 
House of the Wizard " and " The Cardinal's Mus- 
keteer." The former deals with the court of Henry 
VIII., and introduces the luckless figure of Anne 
Boleyn and the sinister figure of the Lord Privy 
Seal. It is a pretty romance, provided with a courtly 
hero and a pert heroine of the customary types. 
In "The Cardinal's Musketeer," Miss Taylor has 
chosen an overworked historical period, and has 
contrived to tell a story of considerable sustained 
interest and a certain delicate charm. The con- 
spiracy of Cinq Mars is the indirect subject of the 
narrative, although that luckless personage is kept 
in the background. The great Cardinal appears, 
however, upon several occasions, but he is too evi- 
dently a lay figure to be impressive. The musketeer- 
hero is no dashing Gascon of the Artagnan type, 
but simply a gentleman who performs his part cred- 
itably, and proves equal to a number of difficult 
situations. His devotion wins the customary re- 
ward, and there is the usual sentimental and happy 
ending. 

Mr. William J. Locke is a novelist whose stories 
are always welcome. Their workmanship is neat, 
and they agreeably portray modern English society 
in its superficial aspects, occasionally also striking 
some deep chord of human feeling. In "The 
White Dove " we have a story of strictly private 
interest, concerned with two or three peculiarly 
strong and lovable characters, and with some others 
whose wickedness provides the necessary foil. It 
is a story of the shadow of past sins falling upon 
young lives and well-nigh marring them forever. 
It has the defect of a somewhat exaggerated senti- 
mental ism, and a stern moralist might object to the 
leniency with which the offenders are dismissed. 
"0 white dove of the pity divine" is the motto 
upon the title page, and serves to explain the name 
given to the book. "Pardon's the word for all" 
might have been added as a supplementary motto, 
for the spirit of forgiveness hovers over the closing 
pages, and even the villain is made to share in the 
writer's largess. Mr. Locke's style is for the most 
part direct and simple, but glows at times with a 
poetic touch, and leaves a pleasant impression. 

In writing " The Bath Comedy," Mr. and Mrs. 
Castle have again collaborated, as they did in " The 
Pride of Jennico." The result is one of the most 
delicious pieces of light literature which it has often 
been our good fortune to read. It is a story of 
Bath in the latter half of the eighteenth century,

the year not too precisely defined. " A sufficient 
reason for reticence in the matter of exact date will 
be found in the unfortunate predicament of the then 
Bishop of Bath and Wells ; undoubtedly a most 
mortifying episode in the life of an invariably dig- 
nified Divine." As there were several Bishops of 
Bath and Wells during the period concerned, no 
cause for scandal is given. This episode, amusing 
as it is, figures as only one of a long series packed 
into the few days which the story covers. As inci- 
dent follows upon incident, each touched with the 
very spirit of comedy, the delight of the reader 
grows apace, and he feels that he would gladly re- 
main in such company for an indefinite period. 
The artful minx who provides the story with all its 
complication is so fascinating a study in femininity 
that we cannot feel very harshly toward her, 
although a severe moralist would find her conduct 
highly reprehensible. The book offers so many 
surprising developments, and is so bubbling with 
mirth, that we are reluctant to think that we shall 
know the heroine no longer. As far as the story 
has a serious side, it is to be found in the note of 
passion that occasionally makes itself heard, and in 
the faithful study which it presents of the language 
and manners of English fashionable life over a 
hundred years ago. 

Mr. Weyman, in the search for material fit for 
his purposes as a novelist, seems to have abandoned 
Continental themes for good, and to have settled 
upon the English historical past as the best field for 
the display of his ingenuity. This material is less 
romantic than the other, but he is more intimately 
acquainted with it, and his later novels upon En- 
glish themes have more reality than his earlier novels 
upon French ones. The habit of the romancer still 
clings to him, and his invention is as fresh as ever, 
but it is impossible to claim for the period in which 
he has elected to work of late the same sort and 
degree of interest afforded by the period of his first 
books. With the best will in the world, one cannot 
find the England of the later Stuarts as satisfactory 
a subject for romantic exploration as the France of 
Henry IV. and of Richelieu. Mr. Weyman's latest 
story is entitled " Sophia," and is a tale of the years 
of Queen Anne. The interest is strictly social and 
private, political history having little to do with the 
occurrences described. The heroine is a wayward 
young woman, sought for her fortune by a villainous 
Irish adventurer, and saved from his persecution by 
an English gentleman of mature years, whose grave 
sincerity she at first despises, but who in the end 
wins her affection. The story has much variety of 
both incident and character, and leads through one 
desperate adventure after another to a conclusion 
that is satisfactory to everybody who deserves to be 
satisfied. The plot is of a nature to strain the 
probabilities, and there is a melodramatic accumu- 
lation of horrors, but the narrative is at least saved 
from prolixity, and holds the interest of the reader 
unabated. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



We believe few persons will ever 
Primitive lore read through Mr. H. T. Finck's 

and love-stories. , . , . -^ , 

ponderous volume of u Primitive 
Love and Love-Stories " (Scribner). Not that the 
author's style is unattractive, or his subject in itself 
uninteresting ; but it is dreary work to plod through 
eight hundred pages of ugly print, for what might 
have been better said in two hundred. Mr. Finck's 
contention is that the ancients, and the modern men 
who in savage life keep up ancient conditions, did 
not and do not experience the passion of romantic 
love. In other words, romantic love is of recent 
development and is found only in the upper stage 
of culture civilization. The author begins with 
an analysis of the emotion, in which he finds just 
fourteen ingredients no more, no less. These 
ingredients are conveniently and neatly divided into 
two groups, of just seven each. There are seven 
egoistic ingredients individual preference, monop- 
olism, jealousy, coyness, hyperbole, mixed moods, 
and pride ; there are seven altruistic ingredients 
sympathy, affection, gallantry, self-sacrifice, adora- 
tion, purity, admiration of personal beauty. The 
ancients, savages, barbarians, even the Orientals, 
may have sensual love with the seven egoistic ingre- 
dients ; but only modern civilized white men have 
real romantic love, with the lately developed seven 
altruistic ingredients. And, alas, but few modern 
civilized white men have experienced this supreme 
emotion. Such is Mr. Finck's theme, drawn out 
through eight hundred pages, illogical, repetitious, 
tiresome. He assumes that anthropologists gener- 
ally assert that all human beings have fully devel- 
oped love of the romantic type, and always have 
had. He then proceeds to demonstrate their errors. 
Probably few anthropologists would now, or ever, 
deny Mr. Finck's fundamental thought, that love is 
a growth and a development. In demonstrating his 
claim, Mr. Finck follows highly unsatisfactory 
methods. Starting by asserting the absolute un- 
trustworthiness of certain authors, he quotes them in 
his own support when it suits him. Passages are 
quoted in support of his contention at one point, 
which are absolutely opposed to conclusions which 
he draws elsewhere. Insisting on literal accuracy 
as the part of all others, he himself is careless in 
reference and statement. Thus, he quotes Charles 
A. Leland and Lewis A. Morgan, and refers (un- 
kindly) in a footnote to J. S. Wood : these names 
are all wrong. He states that Lewis H. Morgan 
lived many years among the Iroquois, and that he 
knew more about the Iroquois than anyone else : 
both false statements. Usually these would be small 
matters to criticize, but they become glaring blun- 
ders considering Mr. Finck's merciless demands 
upon others. Mr. Finck waxes sarcastic at the ex- 
pense of the barbarians whose " love " but shortly 
outlasts the loss or death of the loved woman ; he 
is ever severe with people who " love " more than

one at a time. Plainly, consistency demands that 
he considers romantic love as single and life-long. 
How surprising, then, that he insists upon telling 
us more than once that he has been (romantically) 
in love several times. Mr. Finck has been an indus- 
trious reader, and has really gathered a great mass 
of material. Had he been scientific in method, and 
constructive instead of bitterly and partisanly de- 
structive, he might have rendered a real service to 
science and made a more interesting book, which 
should attempt to trace the growth and development 
of the love sentiment from its low savage beginnings 
up to its most beautiful culmination. We regret 
that he has missed such an opportunity. 

War is just now the all-absorbing 
topic, and rumors of wars to come fill 
the air a sorry sequel to the Czar's 
Peace Congress, that promised so much and would 
seem to have achieved so little either in the sphere 
of events or in the public mind. South Africa is lit 
with battle-flames in a contest so savage that the 
losses on one side must soon equal the total forces of 
the other ; our own country is engaged in the bloody 
subjugation of far distant islands in the ironically- 
named Pacific ; France has a new score to settle with 
Perfidious Albion, and boasts ominously that she was 
" never before so strong as now "; relations between 
Russia and Japan are in a state of most dangerously 
unstable equilibrium ; a great conflagration seems 
imminent in China ; German interests are growing 
apace in revolution-ridden South America ; and 
Senator Lodge is well to the fore at Washington. 
That war has suddenly developed a new horror, in 
the battle-songs of Mr. Alfred Austen, gives no 
pause to the belligerent humor of the times. In 
Anglo-Saxondom, the voice of the man of peace is 
drowned by the strident clamor of Kipling and his 
kind. To adapt the famous phrase of Abbe" Sieyes 
in the Reign of Terror, of what avail is the glass of 
wine of moderate civilized men like Mr. John Morley 
amid such a torrent of brandy? Man, after all, 
appears to be, as Palmerston cynically said, by na- 
ture " a fighting and quarrelling animal," and must 
have his fill of battle and slaughter regularly every 
three or four decades. Never at any previous pe- 
riod of the world's history has that senseless, savage 
thing, race hatred, been so rife and so actively dis- 
seminated. Books reflecting the turn of the popular 
mind, all sorts and conditions of war-books, thrive 
and multiply. Some of them, by gilding and glori- 
fying war, pour oil on the flame, and actively fur- 
ther the work of Satan's agents in the newspapers ; 
others, of a more truthful and literal sort, by paint- 
ing honestly the true face of war, with its squalor, 
ugliness, and infernal horror and brutality, make 
for peace, and render service to God and man. 
But reports of slaughter the world must have, now 
that the business is going on so briskly and with 
such promise of increase in the near future ; and 
the war-correspondent is having his day. Not to be 
altogether out of it, in the matter of making hay

while the sun shines, older war-correspondents, who 
can tell of past wars now fading into relatively an- 
cient history, are bestirring themselves and raking 
over the embers of memory for matters of old expe- 
rience still worth recounting. A writer of this sort, 
and one with a turn for the picturesque, the senti- 
mental, and the melodramatic, is Mr. Irving 
Montague, for many years war artist and corre- 
spondent of the " Illustrated London News." Mr. 
Montague now issues a readable little book of 
sketches (most of them with the short-story flavor) 
drawn from his recollections of the Franco-German 
and Russo-Turkish wars, the Spanish civil wars, and 
the days of the Paris Commune, and collectively 
entitled " Things I Have Seen in War " (Wessels) . 
Some of the titles are : " An Encounter with Kurds," 
" Rescued by the Red Cross," " Round About the 
Redoubts, Plevna," " Osman's Last Stand," " A 
Harem En Dfehabiltt" "Woman's Influence at the 
Front," etc. The sketches are sufficiently spirited, 
and there are sixteen illustrations by the author. 

To wr ite a history of China appro-

a difficult task in condensation and elimination. 
Yet Mr. Robert K. Douglas has accomplished this 
feat in a surprisingly entertaining fashion, for he 
has so combined interesting incidents with the 
names of men and places absolutely unfamiliar to 
American ears as to enlighten the reader and hold 
his attention. Probably the English reader, by 
reason of greater familiarity with Chinese politics 
and history, will find less to interest him in this 
work than will the American ; but for the latter 
the author has rendered a real service in his delin- 
eation of Chinese government and diplomacy, and 
more than all in his characterization of Chinese 
methods of thought and feeling. The history of 
China can by no possibility be condensed satisfac- 
torily into such small compass. The author him- 
self has recognized this, and has wisely chosen to 
confine himself to stating the main points of his 
story in such order as to preserve the historical se- 
quence, while national Chinese characteristics, as 
exemplified when in contact with various foreign 
civilizations, are dwelt upon in some detail. The 
most positive impression received is that of the 
intense pride and sense of superiority with which 
the Chinese authorities regard all ideas and customs 
foreign to their own conception of life. This is not 
merely an intolerance of Western ideas, but an ab- 
solute contempt for them, as manifestations of an 
inferior civilization, a contempt based upon the 
belief that the nations of the earth are glad to do 
homage to the government of China, and that 
China's intellectual development surpasses that of 
all other countries. This point of view seems, and 
really is, incomprehensible to the citizen of a mod- 
ern nation ; for, well as he thinks he understands 
the Chinese mind, he cannot realize the Chinese 
indifference to governmental corruption, lethargy,

and incapability. The inability of peoples of di- 
verse methods of thought to understand each other 
is here, as always, a cause of frequent trouble, and 
after recounting diplomatic attempts toward the 
reasonable settlement of various disputes Mr. 
Douglas emphatically asserts that the only success- 
ful method of dealing with China, for a country at 
variance with that power, is to reach a conclusion 
based on just, not selfish, principles, and then to 
use force if necessary in putting that conclusion 
into effect. Just now, when the " open door " in 
China is being so constantly exploited, it is a little 
surprising that the author should fail to enlarge 
upon the merits or demerits of that policy, or fail 
to assume the prophetic tone. Happily, however, 
he has confined himself to history, and his work 
closes with a brief account of the war with Japan. 
The book has many illustrations, excellent in them- 
selves, but having no particular connection with 

the text. 

" Breezy " is doubtless the review- 
er's inevitable word for Lilian Bell's 
little volume of impressions of for- 
eign lands, entitled "As Seen by Me" (Harper), 
and the " breeziness " sometimes reaches the ty- 
phonic pitch. In the course of her perigrinations 
abroad, the author visited London, Paris, Moscow, 
Rome, Cairo, Constantinople, Athens, etc., and her 
account of how the effete Old World impressed her 
is at least refreshingly candid. For the rest, the 
quality of the book may be indicated by the follow- 
ing passage from it, which is prompted by Miss 
Bell's mortification at the relatively sober dress 
worn by our official representatives abroad : " Jef- 
fersonian simplicity ! How I despise it ! Thomas 
Jefferson, I believe, was the first populist. We had 
had gentlemen for Presidents before him, but he 
was the first one who rooted for votes with the 
common by catering to the gutter instead of to the 
skyline, and the tail end of his policy is to be seen 
in the mortifying appearance of our highest offi- 
cials and representatives. Hinc illce lachrymce! 
... I have worked myself into such a towering 
rage over this subject that there is no getting down 
to earth gracefully or gradually. I have not pol- 
ished off the matter by any manner of means. I 
have only just started in, but a row of stars will 
cool me off." (A row of cooling asterisks follows). 
Miss Bell's giddy little book is not without a cer- 
tain cleverness, but cannot in candor be said to 
" cater to the skyline." 

The wth century W . e like the beginning of Mr. Bl- 
ow we might bridge S. Brooks's " Story of the 
Nineteenth Century" (Lothrop) 
better than its close. He wrote too soon for the 
crowning enormity of European aggression in China, 
but he went far enough to have been able to draw a 
striking analogy between the glories of the French 
Revolution going out in Napoleonic imperialism, 
and the glories of the latter-day Democracy which 
he lauds so highly dimming and degrading them- 



selves with wars of exploitation and conquest in the 
Philippines, or South Africa, or the province of 
Tientsin, as the case may be. At least there was 
no shadowy pretence of philanthropy or civilization 
a century ago, and wars of conquest were wars, not 
benevolences. We learn from Mr. Brooks that on 
November 24, 1899, "Aguinaldo's Philippine re- 
volt [was] overthrown," a pleasant bit of news 
which we are puzzled to account for either as be- 
lated or prophetic. His closing lines inform us that 
the Nineteenth Century " steps grandly in the ad- 
vance as the flower and pride of all the centuries 
since Christ came to Bethlehem, and taught men 
that Golden Rule which, after nineteen hundred 
years of slow and sullen schooling, is to become the 
motive and creator of the great things which the 
new century holds in store for man." 

" A. lovelier faith their happier crown ; 
But history laughs and weeps it down," 

sings Mr. William Watson ; and while we cannot 
but envy Mr. Brooks the robustness of his ethical 
digestion, we cannot agree that he is doing his 
readers a service in twisting the facts of recent 
years into a support for the Golden Rule as distin- 
guished from the rule of gold. The American 
seems to be getting possessed of the thought that 
the way to remedy national faults is to turn away 
the head lest they be seen. 

Given an interest in science, it would 

be d ! ffic f J ' ma g ine a more , at - 

tractive book than " Flame, Elec- 
tricity, and the Camera " ( Doubleday & McClure 
Company). And if the reader brings to the book no 
prepossessions in favor of scientific knowledge, it is 
almost impossible to conceive of his carrying away 
none with him after reading it. The salient feature 
of the work is the description of applied science 
from the first time when man was able to command 
fire as a servant down to the present era of varied 
wonders, each more amazing than the last. Those 
who were born in time to have their daguerreotypes 
taken (and Mr. lies reminds us that Miss Draper, 
whose face was the first to be portrayed by the com- 
bined use of sunlight and chemicals, is still living) 
have a certain advantage over their juniors in this 
very feeling of wonder ; not being born to it after 
the manner of the younger generation, successive 
discoveries are not taken as matters of course 
indeed, there be those of us to whom the telephone 
is not quite real, and the phonograph uncanny. 
But to all, young or old, this book must make its 
appeal. Albeit science has lent much of its best 
effort to the horrible art of destruction known as 
war, it affords the best argument for peace, if only 
that our civilization may live long enough to avail 
itself of the countless benefits of which nothing 
but savage and barbarous greed can now deprive 
us. In addition to all that appears on the surface 
of Mr. Iles's work, there is a pervasive argument 
which proves that every new step forward in the 
way of increased resources reacts and interacts

A cyclopedia of Persons who are fastidious about 
correspondence their stationery, and especially those 
and heraldry. wno affect heraldic blazonry thereon, 
will do well to consult Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews's 
pretty and carefully prepared little manual entitled 
The Writing Table of the Twentieth Century " 
(Brentano's). The book forms an elementary ac- 
count of heraldry (especially designed for the needs 
of American readers), art, engraving, and the estab- 
lished forms for correspondence, and contains over 
three hundred illustrations by the author, which 
include the armorial bearings and devices of over 
five hundred Colonial American families. Those 
who choose to decorate their note-paper, etc., with 
these old-world symbolic insignia should remember 
that nothing is more vulgar and ludicrous in the eyes 
of the initiated than solecisms and improprieties in the 
use of them. The question whether or no the use of 
them at all in democratic America be a solecism we 
do not care to discuss just now. But, at all events, 
if they are to be used they should be used correctly 
and with strict regard to prescribed heraldic form, 
and only by those whose clear and demonstrable 
hereditary right it is to do so. A " bogus " coat-of- 
arms means a " bogus " man ; and there is surely no 
more pitiful spectacle of the kind in the world than 
an American thus fraudulently posing as a scion of 
the feudal aristocracy of Europe adding, as it 
were, the guilt of apostasy to the meanness of petty 
larceny. After a general introduction discussing 
pro and con the propriety of bearing a coat-of-arms 
in America, Mr. Mathews proceeds to treat in 
detail of the principles and insignia of heraldry, of 
visiting cards, cards of invitation, wedding invita- 
tions and announcements, bookplates, monograms, 
dies, seals, etc., and, lastly, of writing papers. The 
book is tastefully illustrated, and should form a 
helpful and graceful adjunct to the home writing- 
table. 

Without conceding that the Bacon- 
ian theorv of the authorship of the 
Bon-Shake*peare. Shakespearean dramas has ever at- 
tained the importance which warrants much serious 
discussion, it is pleasant to observe that Mr. Charles 
Allen has written an interesting book in his " Notes 
on the Bacon-Shakespeare Question" (Houghton). 
Himself a lawyer, the author performs a service in 
clearing away the doubts which former legal com- 
mentators have raised in respect of Shakespeare's 
legal attainments not, indeed, by denying them, 
but rather by extolling them to a point where the 
uninstructed could point the finger and say, "No 
one but a lawyer could have known this ; Shake- 
speare was not a lawyer ; ergo, Bacon wrote it." 
Mr. Allen shows, quite conclusively, that the poet 
was as often wrong as right in his use of legal 
terms and ideas, and that he nowhere displays 
more knowledge of the law than a man of property,

such as he, would ordinarily display. By cleverly 
reversing the process just noted, the author easily 
proves the plays to contain such a knowledge of 
stage-craft and play-acting as Bacon could not have 
acquired without a complete overthrow of the facts 
in his biography, saying in effect, "No one but an 
actor-manager could have known this ; Bacon was 
not an actor-manager; ergo, Shakespeare wrote it." 
The book evinces careful and intelligent reading, 
and is evidently a work of love a typical work, in 
fact, for a highly cultured lawyer to take up by way 
of avocation.

evidently denotes that she will not be very chast." 
But it means nothing of the sort in " The Practice 
of Palmistry for Professional Purposes and Scien- 
tific Students" (Laird & Lee), for the compiler, 
M. le Comte C. de Saint-Germain, graduate of the 
University of France in both letters and law though 
he be, has no fortunes of that sort to evolve, having 
suited his ancient art to the exigencies of Anglo- 
Saxon conventions. His work is most inclusive, 
even to the point of containing a plate from Fer- 
rier's great work on brain functions in the earlier 
part, and another from somebody's phrenology in 
the later. It contains 1,254 original illustrations 
besides, and is certainly set forth in sufficient detail 
to tell any sort of fortune which is not too uncon- 
ventional for modern discussion. That it fills a 
public want cannot be doubted, for it would appear 
that America is perfectly capable of suiting its 
popular science to its popular politics, discussing 
astrology and protection, palmistry and imperial- 
ism, with an intense sobriety which augurs volumes 
for the strenuous life. As Montaigne remarks in 
another place, "the higher the ape climbs, the 
longer his tail appears." 

The plaint of The unpretentious little book by Mr.

desperate attempt to serve God and Mammon, and 
has in it much about a strike and the aspirations of 
the laboring classes. Artless to the last degree in 
any literary sense, the very naivete of the narrative 
tempts the reader on and on, until the conclusion 
quite as artless as the rest is reached. And when 
reached it will be apparent that the author is very 
much in earnest, and takes to heart the thought that 
there is so little place made for the poor in churches 
which are preparing a way for the rich without the 
use of the needle's eye. Many earnest men have 
observed with sadness the difference between the 
Christian life set forth in the New Testament and 
the one led by professing Christians in the modern 
commercial world : the difference appears radical in

under each vowel there is given an alphabetical arrange-

contain tbat vowel, and their equivalents in Spanish. 
This expedient seems to us of doubtful value, as it re- 
quires the student to look up a word, not by the initial

however, that the work is intended for a lesson-book 
rather than for a dictionary.

Cobhurst " are the latest additions to the new library 
edition of Mr. F. R. Stockton's writings, now being 
published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

"Bride Roses" and "Room Forty-five," by Mr. 
W. D. Howells, are two additions to the author's series 
of farces. Each of them makes a neat booklet with 
the imprint of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

One of the most attractive school editions of Scott's 
" Ivanhoe " is that lately issued by Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co. The volume is edited by Mr. Porter L. Mc- 
Clintock, and contains several illustrations by Mr. C. E. 
Brock. 

Carlyle's " French Revolution " makes two volumes 
in the new " Library of English Classics," now in course 
of publication by the Messrs. Macmillan. Mr. A. W. 
Pollard is the editor of these, as of the other volumes 
of the series. 

The " Iliad " of Messrs. Lang, Leaf, and Myers, and 
the " Odyssey " of Messrs. Butcher and Lang, both in 
English prose, as we hardly need to state, are repub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. in inexpensive new editions 
for the use of students. 

" The History of Language," by Mr. Henry Sweet, 
and " A History of South Africa," by Mr. W. Basil 
Worsfold, are two " Temple Primers," in addition to 
those of which we recently acknowledged the receipt. 
The Macmillan Co. are the publishers. 

A new edition, in one volume, of the " Life, Diary, 
and Letters of Edward Thring " by Mr. George R. 
Parkin, is published by the Macmillan Co. With the 
exception of a few minor omissions the text of this 
cheaper edition is identical with that of the two- volume 
work issued some time ago. 

The " Browning Study Programmes " arranged by 
Miss Charlotte Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke, are 
published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. in two edi- 
tions. One fills a single substantial volume; the other 
occupies two smaller ones, uniform with the favorite 
" Camberwell " edition of the poet. 

First in the field among books descriptive of the great 
exhibition now in progress at Paris is Messrs. Laird & 
Lee's " Paris and the Exposition of 1900." The volume 
consists of nearly two hundred half-tone plates, illus- 
trating the principal buildings and points of interest on 
the Exposition grounds, characteristic scenes in the 
streets and parks of Paris, etc., the whole forming a 
collection of interest. The necessary amount of de- 
scriptive text is supplied by Mr. Max Maury.

COLUMBUS IN CUBA. 



At the present time, when we are coming into closer relations with 
Cuba than ever before, few things could possess greater interest for our 
students of history than the account giVen by Columbus himself of his 
discovery and exploration of the historic and beautiful island in 1492. 
The directors of the Old South Work have rendered a distinct service 
in printing as one of their Old South Leaflets the passages from the 
Journal of Columbus in which this account is given. This is No. 102 in 
the series, in which for the mere cost of printing, 5 cents a copy, our 
schools and the people are being furnished with so many original his- 
torical documents. Three valuable Columbus leaflets have already 
appeared in the series : The Account of the Discovery of America, from 
the Life of Columbus by his son, Ferdinand Columbus ; Columbus's 
Letter to Gabriel Sanchez, describing the First Voyage ; and Colum- 
bus's Memorial to Ferdinand and Isabella, sent from Hayti in 1494.

Black Rock 
The Sky Pilot 



" Ralph Connor ' is some man's nom de plume. The 
world will insist on knowing whose. One who can 
write such a book as ' Black Rock ' has no right to con- 
ceal his identity behind a pen name. . . . ' Ralph 
Connor' has gone into the heart of the Northwest Cana- 
dian mountains and has painted for us a picture of life 
in the lumber and mining-camps of surpassing merit. 
With perfect wholesomeness, with exquisite delicacy, 
with entire fidelity, with truest pathos, with freshest 
humor, he has delineated character, has analyzed mo- 
tives and emotions, and has portrayed life. Some of 
his characters deserve immortality, so faithfully are 
they created. . . . ' Black Rock,' if it has a reading 
commensurate with its merits, will prove one of the 
most popular, as it is one of the best and most 
wholesome books of the year." St. Louis Globe- 
Democrat. 

" ' Black Rock ' was good, but ' The Sky Pilot ' 
is better. The matter which he gives us is real life 
virile, true, tender, humorous, pathetic, spiritual, 
wholesome. His Bret Harte manner in describing this 
life has at times a distinct and refreshing quality of 
literary workmanship; his style, fresh, crisp, and terse, 
accords with the Western life, which he well under- 
stands." The Outlook.

A HISTORIC ROMANCE

Just THE RIGHT BOOK to slip into your

A ROYAL ENCHANTRESS 

By LEO CHARLES DESSAR 
Fully illustrated by B. Martin Justice 



A book that portrays in glowing colors that pic- 
turesque period in the history of Africa when 
Cahina, the last Queen of the Berbers, united all 
the northern countries, except Egypt, into one great 
nation. Cahina was beautiful and womanly as 
Cleopatra, wise as Aspasia, brave in battle as 
Boadicea, but in one momentous act of her life 
one of the most tragic scenes of history or fiction 
was cruel as Nero.

"The reader will love him." Omaha World Herald. 

" Has the point and dry force found in the stories told by the 
late lamented author of ' David Jfarum.' If we are not mis- 
taken this book indicates the introduction to the public of a new 
American humorist." The Outlook.

BOOKS FOR THE LIBRARY 

THE INDIANS OF TO-DAY. By GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL, Ph.D. With fifty full-page portraits 

of the most famous chiefs. 4to, buckram, $5.00. 

It is generally acknowledged that Mr. Grinnell is the authority on American Indians. For the first time in many years 
a serious attempt is made to deal fairly with the Indian of to-day ; his past, his present conditions, and his future 
chances. The book is illustrated with a remarkable series of photographs, taken by Mr. F. A. Rhinehart during the Congress 
of Indians at the Omaha Exposition. 

SIR ARTHUR SULLIVAN. His Life Story, with Letters and Reminiscences. With many illustra- 

tions. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

This is the authorized biography of the great composer. It has been prepared under his personal supervision and revised 
by him in proof. It contains many of his letters and much intimate personal matter of great interest. 

" Mr. Lawrence is to be congratulated upon his book, which has its value enhanced by the inclusion of a lecture by Sir 
Arthur Sullivan upon Music, with a criticism of his sacred music by B. W. Findow, and of his secular and more general 
work from the same appreciative hand. The publisher has given the work a worthy setting in all respects, making the book 
one of the noteworthy ones of the year." Chicago Times-Herald. 

THE LIFE OF WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. By LEWIS MELVILLE. With por- 
traits, facsimile of handwriting, and several drawings, many now printed for the first time. In two volumes, 
demy 8vo, cloth, gilt, $7.50. 

Although five and thirty years have passed since his death, until now there has never been published a life of Thackeray 
which has had any pretensions to thoroughness. The present work has been written to fill this void in the literary history of 
the century. It is a complete record of the career of the great novelist, and throws many new lights upon his private as well 
as his public life. Thackeray is presented as novelist, poet, artist, and art critic, and his friendships and tastes are recorded. 

TWO GENTLEMEN IN TOURAINE. By RICHARD SUDBURY. With many full-page illustrations, 

reproduced in photogravure. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

A delightful account of the wanderings of an American gentleman and a member of the French nobility through the his- 
torical chateaux in Touraine. It gives the stories of the various castles, anecdotes of the famous people who lived in them, 
and admirable descriptions of the country.

MARIE CORELLI'S 

NEW LONG NOVEL 



BOY 



A SKETCH 

With Frontispiece. 12mo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1.50. 

This book is the longest and most important work by MISS CORELLI published since 

" The Sorrows of Satan" 

From THE WORCESTER SPY. 

M The story is one full of pathos and reality." 

From THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW. 

" In BOY,' her latest work, Miss Corelli is at her best. In this she has written a story 
which is at once healthy in tendency and in the main true to the facts of human nature. In 
this story the Transvaal war makes its appearance in contemporaneous fiction before it is over. 
The story is excellently constructed, and is told with charming simplicity of style. The char- 
acters are well drawn, and the whole atmosphere of the tale is lifting. As a study of the pos- 
sible effects of good influences in overcoming the tendencies of heredity it is thoughtful, and it 
will add to the solidity of its author's reputation." 

From THE BOSTON COURIER. 

" ' BOY ' is one of the most wonderful delineations of mental development that has ever 
been published. The author's style is, as usual with Miss Corelli, such that tells the tale at 
its best, that holds the attention from the opening of the book until its closing. It informs of 
the earnestness of the writer upon her subject, who at times uses sarcasm in a mighty way. To 
' BOY ' is certainly owing extensive perusal and popularity."

A YEARS PROGRESS IN SECONDARY 
AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 

Only scattering and fragmentary reports of 
the annual meeting of the National Educational 
Association, held last week in Charleston, S. C., 
have yet reached the public. Scattering and 
fragmentary as these reports are, yet, taken in 
connection with the elaborate programme pre- 
viously published, they bring under survey 



nearly the whole field of education, public and 
private. Among the many important subjects 
discussed, none surpassed those relating to 
secondary and higher education, especially as 
these relate to each other. The truth is that 
in the two fields or in the one field, if we are 
to consider them as being but one very un- 
usual progress was made during the year just 
closed. A resume of the leading facts consti- 
tuting this progress may aid readers of THE 
DIAL to grasp the import of the Charleston 
discussions, and to discern whither, for the 
time, the educational affairs of our country are 
tending. 

The Committee on College Entrance Re- 
quirements, appointed in pursuance of action 
taken in Denver in 1895, finished its labors and 
published its report in time for presentation 
and discussion at the Los Angeles meeting a 
year ago. The main object of this Report, it 
will be remembered, was not to fix or to recom- 
mend requirements for admission to the col- 
leges and universities, but rather to make up a 
list of studies deemed suitable for this purpose, 
to establish a series of units or measures, and 
to urge the adoption of this list upon the sec- 
ondary and higher schools. To repeat a figure 
that was used in the discussions at Chicago last 
year, the aim of the Committee was to create a 
uniform educational coinage with which stu- 
dents going to college could discharge their 
entrance indebtedness, the amount of which 
indebtedness the various institutions would fix 
for themselves. Four periods a week for a 
school year was made the unit of value the 
dollar of this new coin of the educational 
realm ; and the colleges were strongly urged 
not to break up these dollars into " change," 
save perhaps in a single instance that is more 
apparent than real. To carry out this central 
idea, much more college entrance-work was 
approved or " stamped " than any institution 
could require or most secondary schools could 
furnish ; thus preparing the way for a liberal 
list of electives in the secondary schools and of 
entrance alternatives at the colleges. Still, the 
Committee strove to hold both electives and 
alternatives in check, by insisting upon certain 



44 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



constant studies : namely, four units in foreign 
languages, two units in mathematics, two in 
English, one in history, and one in science. 
Beyond these constants, it was assumed that 
the schools would do the work they were best 
fitted to do. 

Important discussions and legislation have 
followed this report, conforming in general to 
the lines the Committee had marked out. In 
fact, no one of the numerous reports which the 
National Educational Association has published 
in the last few years has been followed by hap- 
pier immediate results. The Board of Educa- 
tion of the City of Chicago has adopted a 
programme of studies that is in many respects 
in accord with the recommendations of the 
Committee ; while a committee is now at work 
arranging for an approximate uniformity of 
college entrance requirements in the State of 
Illinois. 

In May last, the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and 
Maryland adopted a plan of organization for a 
College Entrance Examination Board that 
should do the work of examining for all the 
institutions directly interested. This move- 
ment had its immediate rise in an address upon 
the subject delivered before the Association in 
December, 1899, by Dr. Nicholas Murray 
Butler. The new board, which is the central 
feature of the plan of organization, consists of 
the president or authorized representative of 
each college or university of the Middle States 
and Maryland having a freshman class of not 
fewer than fifty students, counting both the 
course in Arts and in Sciences, and of five 
representatives of secondary schools to be 
chosen annually by the Association from among 
those that adopted the plan, or in such manner 
as it may direct. The machinery and methods 
of this board are topics that lie aside from our 
present path. It suffices to say that the ob- 
ject of the board, as expressed in the resolutions 
adopted at Trenton in December, is " to bring 
about, as rapidly as possible, agreement upon 
a uniform statement as to each subject required 
by two or more colleges for admission," and to 
*' hold or cause to be held, at convenient points, 
in June of each year, a series of college admis- 
sion examinations, with uniform tests in each 
subject, and issue certificates based upon the 
results of such examinations "; the several col- 
leges in the Middle States and Maryland to 
accept the certificates so issued, " so far as they 
go, in lieu of their.own separate examinations." 
This scheme will go into operation the coming 



autumn, and the first examinations will be held 
in June of next year. The subjects that have 
been chosen are English, history, Latin, Greek, 
French, German, mathematics, physics, chem- 
istry, botany, and zoology. The institutions 
represented are Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Colum- 
bia, Rutgers, Swath more, Union, Vassar, and 
Woman's Colleges, and Colgate, Cornell, 
Princeton, New York, and Pennsylvania Uni- 
versities ; or all the institutions within the geo- 
graphical limits described which have freshman 
classes of fifty or more students. These names 
are at once a pledge that the new plan will be 
thoroughly tried, and also that, if successful, it 
will exert a far-reaching influence. The board 
of examination does not propose to interfere 
directly with college entrance requirements in 
respect either to the studies or to the amount 
of work and study that shall be demanded for 
admission ; but only to establish and carry on 
a mint for the coining of money that shall have 
a uniform value, with which students can pay 
their college entrance charges. However, re- 
sults that are not formally provided for are 
quite certain- to follow. The plan will save 
much labor and expense ; cause the necessary 
work to be better done ; bring about a healthful 
degree of uniformity in studies ; save students, 
preparatory teachers, and professors (deans 
especially) much unnecessary work and per- 
plexity; cultivate good relations among institu- 
tions, and between institutions and the public ; 
and tend to abolish what Dr. Butler has called 
" our educational atomism." Perhaps it is too 
much to expect Eastern colleges and univer- 
sities to adopt at present the Western plan of 
receiving freshmen on the leaving certificates 
of approved preparatory schools ; but while they 
are moving slowly toward that goal, the Middle 
States and Maryland may well be congratulated 
on the long step they have taken in establishing 
this Board of Examinations. Henceforth, Chaos 
ought not to sit as umpire over the colleges and 
universities of that region, and, by deciding, 
more to embroil the fray. 

Much the most important action taken by 
any single college or university during the year 
in respect to entrance is the new requirements 
for admission to Columbia College. Elemen- 
tary French and German have long been col- 
lege studies, and within the last few years some 
institutions have put elementary Greek on the 
same list. Columbia has now taken the unpre- 
cedented step of adding elementary Latin. 
The immediate result will be that a student who 
has taken a non-Latin course in the secondary 



1900.] 



THE DIAL

school may enter Columbia College and pro- 
ceed to the degree of A.B. without prejudice 
arising from that fact. The total requirement 
for admission is fixed at fifteen points, of which 
three must be in English and three in elemen- 
tary mathematics ; while the remaining nine 
may be selected, in measures ranging from one 
point to four points, from a total of twenty-six 
points to be made in Latin, Greek, history, 
French, German, mathematics, physics, Span- 
ish, chemistry, botany, physiography, and zool- 
ogy. At the University of Michigan, also, the 
entrance requirements have been revised in the 
interest of simplicity and elasticity. 

At the Washington meeting of the National 
Educational Association, two years ago, the 
writer of this article presented a paper in the 
department of Higher Instruction on the possi- 
bility and desirability of forming a federation 
of colleges and universities in the United States 
similar to the Association of American Medical 
Colleges. After discussion, a committee of five 
was appointed to report at the uext annual 
meeting of the department a practical plan of 
effecting such a federation, and to offer recom- 
mendations with reference to the same ; but 
this committee was not heard from last year at 
Los Angeles. However, another movement, 
somewhat similar to this one in the outcome, 
but wholly separate from it in origin and 
original purpose, has eventuated in an organ- 
ization known as the Association of American 
Universities. A circular letter, signed by the 
presidents of Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hop- 
kins, Chicago, and California Universities, was 
sent to certain selected institutions, inviting 
them to a conference to be held in Chicago in 
February, at the time of the meeting of the 
Department of Superintendence, to consider 
primarily the relations of American schools and 
students to German universities. In the course 
of the discussions at the conference, this sub- 
ject was quietly dropped, and an association 
bearing the name already given was organized. 
The object of this organization is the consid- 
eration of matters of common interest relating 
to graduate study, and its membership is natur- 
ally limited to institutions that are actually 
engaged in giving advanced or graduate instruc- 
tion. The initial membership consists of Cali- 
fornia, Chicago, Clark, Columbia, Cornell, 
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Pennsyl- 
vania, Princeton, Stanford, Wisconsin, and 
Yale Universities, and the Catholic University 
of America ; and provision is made for length- 
ening the list at the annual conference, by the 



admission of other institutions, on the invita- 
tion of the executive committee endorsed by a 
three-fourths vote of the members. It is ex- 
pected by the founders of this association that 
it will do something of value for fixing the 
standard for the Ph.D. degree, and for its 
proper administration. It may prove to be, 
what one writer has already declared that it is, 
" a long step toward complete university coop- 
eration." 

To explain in full the present status of the 
proposition to found a national institution of 
learning at the national capital is not an easy 
matter. It appears, however, to present three 
distinct forms. The first is the plan, which 
has Washington for its author, to establish at 
the capital of the nation a statutory university. 
This plan is now pending before the Senate in 
the form of " A Bill to Establish the Univer- 
sity of the United States," introduced by Mr. 
Depew. The second form is the plan to organ- 
ize for the purposes of instruction the various 
scientific facilities, resources, and materials 
belonging to the government at Washington, 
such as libraries and museums, collections and 
laboratories, under the supervision and over- 
sight of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, which forms the centre of the new 
scheme ; the instruction furnished to be limited 
to students who are graduates of properly ac- 
credited institutions, or those who are other- 
wise properly qualified ; and no degrees to be 
conferred in connection with such instruction. 
The third form of the proposition is to make the 
Bureau of Education, rather than the Smith- 
sonian Institution, the administrative centre of 
the Bureau of Research, as the new organiza- 
tion is sometimes called. Of these three plans, 
the first is presse.d more or less vigorously by 
a national committee of some four hundred 
members, having Dr. John W. Hoyt as its 
chairman ; the second is urged with much per- 
sistence by the American Association of Agri- 
cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations ; 
while the third does not appear to have any 
organized support. 

The committee of fifteen appointed by the 
President of the National Council of Educa- 
tion, in July, 1898, to investigate the entire 
subject of the establishment of a National Uni- 
versity, has pronounced decidedly against the 
plan of a statutory institution, and has virtu- 
ally, if not formally, declared in favor of some 
alternative plan. The attitude of this commit- 
tee is well shown by two of the propositions 
that it has adopted.

" The government is not called upon to maintain at 
the Capital a University in the ordinary sense of that 
term." 

" That a sub-committee be requested to prepare for 
consideration by the full committee a detailed plan by 
which students who have taken a baccalaureate degree, 
or who have had an equivalent training, may have full 
and systematic advantage of the opportunities for ad- 
vanced instruction and research which may now or may 
hereafter be afforded by the government; such a plan 
to include the cooperation with the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution of the universities willing to accept a share of 
the responsibilities incident thereto." 

For some reason, the full committee did not 
at its February meeting adopt the report of the 
sub- committee, but, after discussion, referred 
it back to the sub-committee without action. 
It was expected that the subject would come 
up for final disposition at the late meeting of 
the National Educational Association, in sub- 
stantial accordance with the above report. 

So the matter stands at present. Unless 
Congress shall sooner cut the Gordian knot, 
which is hardly to be expected, the next step, 
if any, will no doubt be taken by the Regents 
of the Smithsonian Institution. Conjectures 
as to what they will probably do would be pre- 
mature. It is known, however, that while the 
Regents are in sympathy with the ultimate 
purpose of the American Association of Agri- 
cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, 
they find themselves seriously embarrassed 
when they take up the question of the provis- 
ion of funds with which to do the work that 
would be required, and the further question of 
correlating formal instruction or teaching with 
their own original and primary office of ad- 
vancing knowledge among men. To quote one 
of the abler organs of public opinion : 

" One of the most interesting developments of spe- 
cialization now going on in higher education in this 
country is that which looks toward a better training for 
business men and civil servants. Whatever the pre- 
vailing view of the primary objects of a college or a 
university, and however narrowly one may be disposed 
to limit its essential field, there can be no question that 
the most progressive of these institutions are now zeal- 
ously seeking to put themselves in touch with the prac- 
tical business needs of the times, and to fit their stu- 
dents for participation in every-day affairs." 

Proofs of this tendency have become too 
pronounced to be overlooked or underrated. 
The Wharton School of the University of 
Pennsylvania, the School of Political Science 
of Columbia University, and the elaborate 
courses in history and economics at several of 
the stronger institutions, were the forerunners 
of the new movement. Two years ago, the 
University of California founded a School of 



Commerce, including in its curriculum studies 
in history, political science, commercial and 
international law, technological subjects, and 
modern languages ; and laying emphasis upon 
our commercial relations with Asia. A little 
more than a year ago, the New York Chamber 
of Commerce determined to cooperate with 
Columbia University in establishing a collegi- 
ate course of instruction in commerce, to be 
open to high-school graduates, and to cover 
four years. Dartmouth College has recently 
announced the Tuck School, with a programme 
of studies bearing directly upon preparation 
for business and administrative life. Again, 
the University of Wisconsin has also taken 
steps to organize a School of Commerce, while 
the University of Michigan has just sent out 
an announcement of special courses in higher 
commercial education and in public adminis- 
tration. These courses are especially intended 
for students, graduates or under-graduates, who 
desire to specialize in history, economics, and 
related subjects ; but they are also thrown open 
to those who wish to prepare for the polit- 
ical and social side of newspaper work, for 
teaching history and political science in col- 
leges and high schools, for philanthropic and 
pastoral work, or for diplomatic or consular 
service. 

These several schools and courses of instruc- 
tion are not yet fully organized, but that con- 
summation will not be long deferred. The 
causes that have produced them, and that 
promise to produce others like them, call for 
but the slightest suggestion. They are the in- 
dustrial and political, the commercial and so- 
cial, activities of the times. Such schools and 
courses would no doubt have come in time, had 
the nation moved on in its old path ; but they 
have been materially hastened by the fuller 
development of the national self-consciousness 
that has followed events in our recent history. 
Those persons who adopt Mr. Lowell's charac- 
terization of a university as a place where noth- 
ing useful is taught, are not likely to take 
kindly to the new development ; but they are 
no more likely to oppose to it a successful re- 
sistance. In fact, we are but following in the 
footsteps of Europe. Special schools for teach- 
ing business and administration have already 
been successfully established in France, Ger- 
many, Austria, and Italy the best known of 
all, perhaps, being the school at Leipsic. The 
new University of Birmingham, England, will 
include a faculty of commerce.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



DANGERS AND DRAWBACKS IN ENDOWMENTS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The publication, in THE DIAL for June 16, of statistics 
regarding recent gifts and bequests for educational, 
religious, and other humane purposes, suggests some 
further comments. In the first place it is to be noticed 
that not only was the gross amount contributed for 
1899 ($65,000,000) much greater than for any other 
year recorded (1893-1899), but the number of con- 
tributors was nevertheless smaller, making the average 
amounts contributed one-half larger, than for any pre- 
vious year. In other words, much larger sums were 
contributed by a smaller number of individuals. These 
statistics do not include, however, endowments under 
five thousand dollars, though these must have been 
important, and may even have exceeded in gross amount 
the sums tabulated. Only by knowing the increase or 
decrease in the gross amount of these smaller endowments 
can the complete significance of the published statistics 
concerning larger endowments be determined. Since 
this is not known, we are quite in the dark regarding 
the relative gross amount of all endowments for 1899 
compared with those for previous years. We may sup- 
pose, however, that they were probably somewhat 
greater, since the presumptive decrease in smaller en- 
dowments was very likely more than made up by the 
increase in very large gifts. The impression shining 
out of the article referred to, that we have entered into 
a very paradise of institutional endowments, may re- 
quire modification. Since these tabulations seem to 
show that not more than one in fifty, or possibly one in 
a hundred, of our millionaires contributed at all, and 
since single individuals or corporations are known to 
have accumulated within the single year sums bordering 
close upon, or exceeding, the entire amount of these 
tabulations, we should exercise due restraint in judging 
Ihe self-sacrificing benevolence of this wealthy social 
class. 

If these statistics for 1899 really point, as they seem 
to point, to a future in which many smaller endowments 
must give place to fewer large ones, to accord perhaps 
with tendencies toward concentration of wealth, we may 
well hesitate to express congratulation for any expected 
future increase in the total amounts. As between hav- 
ing educational and humane institutions supported by 
many smaller contributions, or by few large ones, by all 
means if possible let us have the former. In the first 
place, this would signify that the people themselves 
were financially able and willing to maintain their own 
cherished institutions; while a people who are able to 
have great institutions only through the gifts of the 
very wealthy are in danger of being blinded by the 
ameliorating and debauching influences of charity to 
the paramount duty of obtaining more just economic 
conditions for society in general. Moreover, that any- 
one should be able by reason of his wealth to influence 
unduly our religious or educational institutions, is on 
the whole unfortunate. When these institutions are 
carried on through the support of many persons, there 
need be little fear of undue domination by any particular 
benefactor. But if an institution owes its existence 
wholly, or in very large part, to the financial support of 
one man, he is in a position to exercise very great influ- 
ence over its management and policy. If the endow- 
ment of institutions had no bearing upon the material 



welfare of their administrators, and if human action 
were honestly determined in strict accordance with 
correct reasoning processes, we should have no occasion 
to fear the subtle influence of wealth upon our educa- 
tional or religious institutions. But the material wel- 
fare of the adminstrators is closely wrapped up in the 
worldly success of these institutions; and the human 
mind is wonderfully impressionable, and always prone 
to be swayed by transient conditions and temptations. 
The destruction of ideals is a subtle and gradual pro- 
cess, and once begun it is not easy for it to stop. 

Of course, the sort of influence exercised by a munifi- 
cent donor will depend upon the man. His influence 
may be broad and wholesome, or narrow and injurious. 
But the fact that it is exercised, in a large degree, 
under practical compulsion, makes it always objection- 
able. Moreover, it is usually, if not always, a secret 
influence. Thus it may happen that an institution 
which stands before the world as free and sincere, may 
in fact be in certain respects scarcely more than the 
hired advocate of a certain rich benefactor. I do not 
say that all large endowments are attended with this 
insidious influence; but I do say that the possibility of 
such influence is real enough to awaken serious mis- 
givings. 

In times of social and economic ferment and unrest, 
such as we are living in, it is very important that two 
institutions, because of their functions as moral and 
economic teachers, should remain absolutely unham- 
pered, the church and the college. And in view of 
the well-known ultra-conservative attitude of great 
wealth, large endowments to such institutions cannot at 
this time be dissociated from economic considerations. 
A prominent type in the commercial world, whose gifts 
to religious and educational institutions have been large, 
is deserving of special consideration. Great fortunes 
may sometimes be acquired through sheer unaided 
ability and force, though also, more likely, with the 
addition of circumstance and favorable economic condi- 
tions. But it is believed that in the accumulation of 
such fortunes other elements are sometimes actively 
concerned, such as an unscrupulous disregard of others' 
rights, if not an almost absolute disregard of honor. 
More and more are we seeing men who, through the 
instrument of political bribery, deliberately purpose to 
undermine the very foundations of justice and national 
life in order to enrich themselves, insinuating their influ- 
ence into religious and educational institutions. It is a 
peculiarly ingenuous innocence which fails to suspect in 
this a concealed purpose. Is there anything more hu- 
man than the disposition of a corrupt man of social 
standing to maintain his outward respectability ? Could 
anything be better calculated to ameliorate the harsh- 
ness of public criticism for public crime than munificent 
financial encouragement to institutions which stand most 
for purity and truth ? And is it likely that one whose 
methods of corruption have insinuated themselves into his 
every political and business association should scruple to 
insidiously attempt the debasement of moral ideals to the 
level of his own, if his welfare seemed to demand it ? 
The problem of de-Christianizing the world may be 
large, but some men glory in large problems. Can 
anyone be found willing to maintain that no progress in 
this evil direction has been made ? 

The problems confronting the administrators of the 
immense funds of our endowed institutions are, as stated 
in THE DIAL'S article, serious. But again I must insist 
that bestowed funds do have a commercial significance, 



48 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



not only by reason of the conditions which created them, 
or of the possibility of their influence upon moral and 
economic perceptions and teachings, but also because 
their administration forces the institutions themselves 
into commercial activities. Large endowments un- 
doubtedly consist in considerable part of the watered 
stock of corporations whose dividends depend upon sys- 
tematic public corruption. The first moral problem 
which administrators have to meet is to determine 
whether such wealth can honestly be accepted at all 
(although this doubtless scarcely presents itself as a 
real problem) ; the second, to determine what their atti- 
tude shall be in the business world upon matters involv- 
ing business immorality; and third, that of deciding 
whether the teachings of the institution concerned shall 
be permitted to influence detrimentally the possible 
earnings of invested funds, or to endanger possible 
future endowments. It is not my purpose to pursue 
this aspect of the matter further. But I wish, in finally 
emphasizing the contention that commercialism is closely 
twined about all sides of the endowment question, to 
quote the following statement concerning the property 
of one of our prominent educational institutions (made 
in the " Chicago Tribune " of April 28, 1900, by Build- 
ing Commissioner McAndrews) : " There are rows and 
rows of unsafe and unsanitary buildings in the Nine- 
teenth Ward which belonged to the Hull estate and are 

now owned by University." At least four of these 

buildings were ordered destroyed, including one devoted 
to a presumably profitable saloon business. Evidently 
the very poor are paying for the education of the com- 
fortable classes more directly than some of us had pre- 
sumed. It speaks with peculiar earnestness for the 
moral sincerity of this institution, that it sees fit to 
foster a " social settlement," to aid its students in the 
study of the awful conditions of a " slum " neighbor- 
hood, which it is finding profit in helping to perpetuate. 
The contemplation of a great humane institution is 
truly inspiring, but none the less if it be the fruit of 
the generosity of many small donors rather than that of 
one, or a few, extremely large. One of the main pur- 
poses of this communication is to utter what seems to be 
a needed warning, that large endowments are prone 
to foster a complacency regarding the injustices through 
which much of our great wealth is accumulated. If 
the endowments to a great university may so subvert 
the moral judgment of its president as to cause him to 
hold that it matters little how a man obtains his wealth 
so long as he bestows it properly, surely none of us can 
be accounted safe from this subtle influence.

WANTED A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In December of last year the writer submitted to the 
Committee on Cooperation of the American Library 
Association, and to the Committee on Bibliography of 
the American Historical Association, a plan for a com- 
plete bibliography of American literature. The work 
was to be done cooperatively by several libraries and 
under the auspices of the above mentioned and other 
scientific societies, which, it was thought, might be able 
to bear the cost of editing and publishing. The first- 
named Committee reported at the annual meeting of 
the American Library Association at Montreal last 
month " that the Committee recognized the importance 
of such a catalogue, and that the plans for cooperative 



cataloguing now under consideration may open the way 
to its preparation." 

Plans for cooperative cataloguing of books for libra- 
ries have been put before American librarians at various 
times during the last half century, and their realization 
at this time, as decided upon at the Montreal conference, 
will mark in a fitting way the end of a century rich in 
achievements in librarianship and bibliography, and ripe 
with promises of a still greater future. 

Cooperative cataloguing for libraries, in order to be 
successful, must be made according to rules that are a 
result of a compromise between the conflicting rules and 
practices of many libraries of different character. A 
bibliography, on the other hand, must follow scientific 
principles uncompromisingly. It is, indeed, doubtful 
whether libraries like the Boston and New York public 
libraries and the Library of Congress, engaged as they 
are in very important work peculiarly their own, could 
cooperate in an undertaking not directly concerned with 
their own immediate objects. These libraries and a, 
few others possess the main part of the material for an 
American bibliography ; but a great mass of material, 
seemingly of less value, certainly of a more ephemeral 
nature, will be found in a great number of smaller and 
obscure libraries. This is particularly true of topo- 
graphical, biographical, and other local literature. It 
is plain that in order to get together all this material 
laborious research would have to be made in various 
parts of the country. 

The compilation of such a bibliography as has been 
planned must necessarily be a work of years, even if 
undertaken by a considerable number of bibliographers. 
Some plan must therefore be devised whereby the ma- 
terial will be made available as far as already collected. 
Such a device has been found by the Committee on 
Cooperation of the American Library Association which 
proposes to make for each title a linotype plate after the 
plan used in the John Crerar Library, and to keep on 
hand cards printed from these plates. The plates and 
the cards being numbered, it will be possible to publish 
a list of books on certain subjects, or by certain authors, 
as soon as the completeness of the material at hand 
may warrant publication. 

The need of an American bibliography is the most 
pressing, but by no means the only, need of the Amer- 
ican bibliographer. To give only one example, a new, 
complete, and trustworthy critical bibliography of bib- 
liographies might be prepared by the joint labor of 
bibliographers and scientific specialists. A bureau of 
information in matters bibliographical is a desideratum 
long felt among bibliographers and scholars. Again, 
there is not in this country a single magazine devoted 
to scientific and bibliophilic bibliography. 

No library, no publishing house, could think of under- 
taking a work of the magnitude here suggested. The 
various undertakings outlined cannot be attempted ex- 
cept by a specially founded Bibliographical Institute, 
with a large endowment and a competent staff of bibli- 
ographers and scientific men. An endowment for one 
institution of this kind would be of as much value as 
the endowment of ten public libraries. 

If such an institution were founded in connection with 
a university, there might be a way of realizing the ideal 
aimed at but not yet even approached in any of the 
library schools in the country, namely, a real post- 
graduate course in bibliography and librarianship.

MR. FISKE ox THE CIVIL, WAR.* 

Laying aside temporarily his general scheme 
for a continuous series of American histories, 
Mr. Fiske now enters one field of the Civil 
War, and indites " a purely military narra- 
tive " of the campaigns in the Mississippi Val- 
ley, including in this term the whole of the 
territory drained by the great river and its 
tributaries. This narrative is brought down to 
the close of the year 1864, and thus virtually 
covers the period of the entire war. Indeed, 
it is the theory of this volume that the war was 
mainly fought in the great valley, and that it 
was the achievements of the Federal armies on 
this Western field which made the war for the 
Union a success. Mr. Fiske's mode of pre- 
senting the subject is striking. He pictures 
the aggregation of all the campaigns in this 
field as one extensive battle, waged on the 
modern plan, in which the result depends upon 
skill in flanking. The Appalachian chain of 
mountains had divided the general field into 
two fields, each of which was to be separately 
fought for. In the East, broad flanking opera- 
tions were not feasible, and the campaigning 
was largely limited to frontal attacks, which at 
the end of four years had not carried the Fed- 
eral forces beyond the James River. The pro- 
longed contest for the possession of the great 
Western field was distinguished by a continu- 
ous succession of flanking movements, of which 
the most sanguinary battles were incidents, and 
in which the left flank of the Confederacy's 
Mississippi Valley armies was continuously 
turned. Their extreme left was rolled back 
when the state of Missouri was occupied by the 
Federals. Next, the line of defense first estab- 
lished, with its left resting on the Ohio, was 
turned by the reduction of Forts Henry and 
Donelson, and the Federal occupation of the 
Mississippi below Columbus. The Confederates 
established a new line of defense along the 
railroad running east from Memphis, which 
was in turn flanked as a result of the battles of 
Shiloh, luka, and Corinth, and other operations 
on the Mississippi ; and the recovery of the 
entire control of that stream closed a broad 
flanking movement, and forced the forming of 
new lines by the Confederates, in a reduced 
territory. Once again was their left turned,

Fiske. Boston : Honghton, Mifflin & Go. 



when the campaigning around Chattanooga 
terminated in the fall of Atlanta and the march 
to the sea, of all which, Hood's advance upon 
Nashville and the accompanying battles were 
but incidents ; and this extensive flanking 
operation made the ultimate surrender of Lee 
inevitable. 

In his narrative recital of the main features 
of these movements, Mr. Fiske exhibits the 
breadth of view, keen analysis, and judicious 
generalization with which the readers of his 
other writings are familiar. As one turns 
these pages, it is a gigantic game of chess which 
one sees mapped out before him. Island Ten, 
Corinth, Vicksburg, New Orleans, Chattanooga, 
Atlanta, are squares upon the chess-board ; and 
the armies and corps of Grant, Sherman, 
Thomas, Johnston, Pemberton, and Hood, are 
the pieces and pawns of the magnificent game. 
Grant, on the Big Black Eiver, between his 
antagonists Pemberton and Johnston, is no 
more embarrassed than is the White Queen 
who has invaded the domains of the Black 
King, reserving both direct and diagonal lines 
of movement ; or than the White Knight who, 
though surrounded by Black adversaries, still 
has squares unoccupied by them to which he 
can make his erratic retreat. Frequently, 
Mr. Fiske finds the peculiar terms of chess 
most pertinent for his illustrations. And this 
analogy forcibly impresses the necessity of one 
skilful manager to plan and direct all the de- 
tails of the great enterprise. The several epi- 
sodes of the war in the West are dictated by 
the chess-player. The recovery of Missouri, 
which, it is here hinted, took the west bank of 
the Mississippi out of the active field of the 
war ; the steps by which the control of that 
river was reassumed, namely, Fort Donelson 
and Shiloh, the capture of New Orleans, the 
battles of Corinth and Stone River, and finally 
the reduction of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, 
each of these is but a move upon the mighty 
chess-board of war. 

Such a capacity for generalization as is recog- 
nized in Mr. Fiske finds a congenial opportu- 
nity in the task of dealing thus comprehensively 
with the Civil War. We find in this book all 
the charm of his other historical essays. His 
facile pen flows as rapidly and as smoothly 
through sanguinary campaigns and terrible 
crises as it has heretofore done through political 
manoeuvres and intrigue, and the romantic and 
thrilling experiences of frontier life. 

But Mr. Fiske has sought to condense so 
much into this one volume of 360 pages that 



50 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



he has apparently pressed out some important 
episodes altogether, and has sacrificed histor- 
ical proportion. We are transported from the 
western side of the Mississippi to the eastern, 
with the impression that the operations in the 
former field are virtually ended by its conquest 
in the first year of the war. The battle of 
Helena, on July 4, 1863, is a witness to the 
contrary ; but this engagement is not mentioned 
by our author. He gives, very appropriately, 
a chapter to Hood's march upon Nashville, 
undertaken for the purpose of embarrassing 
Sherman at Atlanta. But it was in like man- 
ner that Price had hoped, in 1863, to embarrass 
Grant at Vicksburg by the capture of Helena. 
Fiske says that later, in September, 1864, "the 
irrepressible Sterling Price had bounced up 
once more in Missouri." But he had done 
more than this in July, 1863 : he had gathered 
an army of 14,000 men, whom he sought to fire 
to action with the appeal, " The invaders who 
seek to subjugate you have been driven from 
Arkansas save at one point, Helena ; we go to 
retake it." Fiske gives due credit to General 
Benjamin M. Prentiss for having " saved the 
day " at Shiloh by the persistence and stub- 
bornness of his resistance to the Confederate 
onslaughts. But Prentiss rendered more con- 
spicuous and valuable service at Helena, where 
he brilliantly repelled the impetuous attack 
of Price's greatly superior force. By stoutly 
holding with his small army the west bank of 
the river at Helena, he ably complemented the 
work of Grant at Vicksburg, and helped to 
make it a verity that " the Father of Waters 
rolled unvexed to the sea." No one episode 
of the war in the West had a more distinct 
effect upon the whole situation than this march 
by Price upon Helena and his crushing repulse ; 
nor could Mr. Fiske have found a more fortu- 
nate subject for the exercise of his powers of 
picturesque and dramatic description. The 
greater glamor of Vicksburg and Gettysburg 
has served to dim the real lustre of Helena ; but 
this should not be allowed to mislead, at this 
distance of time, a careful observer of the moves 
on the chess-board of the Mississippi Valley. 

The biographical part of this history does 
not conform to our author's usual standard of 
accuracy. He styles the same General Prentiss, 
who entered the service from Illinois, a " West 
Virginian Brigadier." He dismisses General 
Albert Pike, of the Confederate Army, with 
the appellation of " an adventurer from Massa- 
chusetts." But Pike was in no proper sense an 
adventurer, though born in New England, for 



he had lived longer in Arkansas than General 
Blair, whom Mr. Fiske idolizes, had lived in 
Missouri. 

Our author is apparently a good hater, as 
witness his treatment of General Benjamin F. 
Butler. Though he does not style him " an 
adventurer from Massachusetts," he adminis- 
ters to his memory a stinging excoriation for 
his acts as commander in New Orleans. Doubt- 
less these incidents in Butler's career, and much 
other personal gossip such as abounds in this 
book, were introduced by the author to enliven 
and spice his lectures, in which form these 
chapters of history were first presented. They 
may add entertainment to a discourse which 
might otherwise prove dry and forbidding, and 
thus make more readable the details of marches 
and countermarches and skirmishes and bloody 
battles. This may have been the author's 
intention. But we do not expect such outbreaks 
from the impartial historian.

THE WORKING PEOPLE or AMERICA.* 



"America's Working People " forms the sub- 
ject of the second of Mr. Charles B. Spahr's 
contributions to the sociological literature of the 
day ; and, like his " Distribution of Wealth," 
the present work deserves the most careful 
attention. To the student of the modern novel, 
these researches into modern American life will 
show how impossible is it for one man to seek 
any adequate interpretation of that life at the 
present time, even should his work take the 
vast scope of another " Comedie Humaine "; to 
the politician they will prove little or nothing ; 
but the statesman will find them compact with 
that true spirit of American manhood and de- 
mocracy which the politicians have been doing 
their best to prostitute by pensions, bounties, 
and special privileges of all sorts. To the plain 
citizen and patriot who loves America as he loves 
his mother, the book is one of hope and illumi- 
nation, especially worth reading by those whose 
residence in cities has given them an outlook 
upon the rest of their native land as if through 
smoked glass ; and, finally, all humane and con- 
scientious people will find here inducement to 
labor unceasingly and with good courage. 

Mr. Spahr has gone the round of the United 
States in search of truth : unlike Diogenes 
probably because his method is the reverse of

cynical he has found it. His journeys began 
with the older factory towns of New England ; 
successively he took up the new factory towns 
in the Southern States, went to a country where 
the life is still that of the pioneer engaged in 
clearing away the primeval forests of Arkan- 
sas, made investigations concerning the negro 
both as workman and citizen which shed new 
light on a dark subject, dug into that still 
darker blot upon our civilization comprised in 
the coal mines and iron works of Pennsylvania, 
studied the trades-unions of Chicago with a 
perspicuity which led him nearer the truth than 
any other writer with whom we are familiar, 
talked and lived for a time with the Mormons 
of Utah, and learned much concerning a much 
misunderstood people, and concluded his wan- 
derings among the northern farms of Minne- 
sota and the Dakotas. In most places, but 
most of all among these northern farmers, Mr. 
Spahr found the people free that is, he saw 
them to be Americans, unafraid of any man 
that walks the globe, sovereign citizens of the 
sort which bids the world wonder at a real de- 
mocracy of humanity. Here and there, as 
among the workmen in the Chicago building 
trades, he discovered an advocacy of freedom 
which is perilously near to lawlessness. Else- 
where, sporadically, he saw servility, the fawn- 
ing upon superiors which our fathers learned to 
despise generations ago as " flunkeyism." Here 
is an example of this, quite as marked in its 
way as the heartbreaking failure of philan- 
thropy at Pullman in 1894 : 

" All that I saw at Homestead convinced me that 
Mr. Carnegie was unusually sincere in his desire for 
the welfare of his employees. President McKinley is 
not more so in his desire for the welfare of Luzon. But 
the fatal defect which Mr. Carnegie observes in the 
President's policy in the Philippines permeates his own 
policy at Homestead. The government at Homestead 
aims to be government for the people, but its funda- 
mental principle is that there shall be no government by 
the people. He who joins an organization of the em- 
ployees at Homestead to resist the absolute supremacy 
of the employers is warned in advance that he can ac- 
complish nothing except his own ruin. The policy is 
not, indeed, that which Mr. Carnegie employed when 
he was directly in charge. In an unusual degree he 
sympathized with the organization of the men for self- 
government. But the imperialist policy in its most abso- 
lute lines is the one pursued and avowed by the present 
head of the Carnegie company, Mr. Charles M. Schwab." 

Similar bits of illumination pervade the book, 
and no one can read it without the conviction 
that the issue really before the American peo- 
ple is that which Professor William G. Sumner 
has so succinctly stated as " the issue between 
plutocracy and democracy." A single regret 



remains after reading Mr. Spahr's book through 
twice with the certainty of taking it up for 
more than one re-reading : he did not dig out 
the truth of the iniquity in the Coaur d'Alene 
region in Idaho, a spot on the continent, not in 
the islands, where imperialism and militarism 
are reigning unmodified and unchecked.

THE EMPIRE OF THE MOORS.* 



The northwest corner of the continent of 
Africa is practically an unknown country even 
to the educated reader on this side of the sea. 
This Moorish sultanate borders on the Medi- 
terranean and the Atlantic, and on Algeria and 
the Sahara. It embraces about 220,000 square 
miles. Its rulers and people have played a 
tragical role in the world's history for more 
than a thousand years. 

Mr. Meakin's " Historical Epitome of the 
Moorish Empire " is the first of a series of 
three volumes on this land and people. The 
bibliography of this vast empire has already 
passed far beyond two .thousand titles. But 
there has been no modern work in English that 
brings the history down to the present date. 
The present volume epitomizes the history of 
the empire; the second, already announced, 
will give a comprehensive description of " The 
Land of the Moors "; and the third will be a 
comprehensive description of the Moors. 

The portly volume before us is broken into 
three parts, dealing with internal development, 
external relations, and Moroccan literature, 
with an appendix on " classical authorities on 
Morocco." The first part is a rapid sketch of 
history from 500 B. C. down to 1894 A. D. 
It is so sketchy, now and then, as to presup- 
pose more information than most of its readers 
possess. But its narrative rather than statis- 
tical style holds and carries along the mind of 
the reader with an ever-increasing interest. 
The author fortifies his pithy statements by 
ample references to the chief authorities on 
Moorish history. This feature of the work 
assures the reader that the author is not pre- 
suming on his good faith, but is ready to give 
him for his own verification the basis of his 
assertions. To aid in a proper conception of 
the history of the empire, the book is supplied 
with a comparative chart, which presents to

the eye, in a length of about one yard, its his- 
torical, chronological, geographical, and geneo- 
logical relations and features. This, with 
smaller charts and illustrations in abundance, 
affords a very definite idea of the vicissitudes 
of that strange and often dreadful empire. 

There is no part of that long stretch of his- 
tory that exceeds for grim savagery and tyran- 
nical villainy the career of Mulai Ismail, whose 
long reign covered a period of fifty-five years, 
(1672-1727). The author so condenses his 
administration (pp. 139-161) that the horrible 
details of his barbarity must be omitted. The 
beginning of his reign is described thus : 

" In announcing this [the determination to make 
Mequinez his capital] he sent ten thousand heads, includ- 
ing those of women and children slain in his rival's 
camp, to adorn the walls of Fez and Marr&kesh, while 
he caused the bodies of prisoners of war to be inter- 
woven with rushes to form a bridge whereby the vic- 
torious army might cross a river. Thus commenced 
the horrors of that awful reign." 

Chenier, in describing his perfidious career, 
says : 

" Active, enterprising, and politic, this emperor tar- 
nished the glory of his reign by avarice, duplicity, 
oppression, injustice, and continuous barbarities, the 
relation of which would be dreadful, and the remem- 
brance of which time only can efface. . . . Nero, 
Caligula, Heliogabalus were abhorent villains; yet Nero, 
Caligula, Heliogabalus themselves were unequal to the 
fiend of whose acts I give [in earlier chapters] but a 
partial account." 

His mastery of the situation and his moulding 
influence in crystallizing the character of the 
empire were such that our author adds : "With- 
out an understanding of the Moorish Empire 
as Ismail left it, it would be impossible to un- 
derstand Morocco as it is." 

After drawing a lurid picture of the excesses 
and oppressions of the present administration 
of Morocco, we discover a ray of sunlight in 
the following (p. 225) : 

" The only satisfactory officials in Morocco, as a rule, 
are those who have been drawn from the ranks of re- 
tired men of business men whose palms no longer 
itch whose knowledge of the world enables them to 
act with dignity and fairness, and whose intercourse 
with Europeans has removed their prejudices to a great 
extent. The Moorish method is to select from among 
such men those whose reputation is high, to appoint 
them as administrators of customs, of whom there are 
several at every port. . . . For foreign payments these 
administrators serve as Moorish Government bankers, 
on whom orders are given at court, and altogether they 
play a part not unlike, though far behind, that played 
by the excellent service under the inspector-general of 
Chinese imperial customs." 

The external relations of the Empire are de- 
picted in strong terms. Beginning with 1246 
A.D., the author traces with sufficient fulness 



the part which Europeans and others have 
taken and suffered in their relations with the 
Moors. The horrors perpetrated, particularly 
on Christian slaves, by the above-mentioned 
Mulai Ismail are indescribable and blood-curd- 
ling. The only check to Moorish barbarity 
toward foreigners lay in their fear of European 
powers. This, with other influences, has some- 
what modified and promoted their foreign re- 
lations. Foreign enlightenment has compelled 
His Majesty to regard to some extent the 
wishes of his subjects. Foreign powers have 
also set some limits to his absolute freedom. 
So that our author speaks of " that decrepit 
Power which now, by courtesy alone, retains 
the name of * the Moorish Empire,' ... a 
ghastly travesty of empire." France, beyond 
all other nations, is said to be casting longing 
eyes toward this territory, as an important 
section of her projected African empire. 

The author has done good service for stu- 
dents of history in general and of Morocco in 
particular by his 110 pages of discussion of the 
best literature on Morocco. A part of the ma- 
terial is in the form of reviews of books and 
pamphlets by the best writers. If the works 
announced shall come up to the standard here 
laid down, modern students of ethnology, his- 
tory, and geography will have a valuable con- 
tribution to their apparatus.

ETHNOGRAPHIC ALBUM OF 
MEXICAN INDIANS.* 



The opportunity to go among barbarous 
peoples is given to but few. Nor are there 
many who have the enthusiasm or the interest 
to create such opportunity. There are no well- 
defined tourist routes to the homes of the un- 
civilized, nor carefully planned accommodations 
for the traveller in those regions. He must 
take his host as he finds him, but usually he 
can be assured that his reception will not be 
unkindly nor his hospitality stinted. 

Though so few really know the uncivilized 
man at home, almost everyone finds him inter- 
esting as a curiosity, and an increasing number 
are coming to learn more and more from him 
by serious study. So to almost everyone an 
ethnographic album, such as Professor Fred- 
erick Starr has given us of the Indians of 
Southern Mexico, comes as a pleasant surprise

among books, and as an object of great interest. 
It is entertaining to see how other people do 
things ; it is of value to the student to be able 
to make a comparative study of the mode of 
life, dress, customs, and physical features of 
other people than ourselves. 

There are few places in the world where the 
mixture of tribes and languages is more con- 
fused than in Southern Mexico and Central 
America. An interesting problem is here pre- 
sented to the student of ethnology, to account 
for this confusion. Is it due to a mixture of 
many radically distinct tribes? or are these 
but variations of a few stocks now so far apart 
that little connection between them can be de- 
tected ? In the absence of all historic data, the 
answer to such a question is to be found in a 
study of the customs and physical features of 
the people themselves. This is the work which 
Professor Starr has been carrying on for some 
years. He has made many visits to Mexico, 
accompanied by a photographer, and has visited 
those least known, least accessible, and most 
interesting parts of the Mexican Republic. One 
result of this work appears in his album illus- 
trating the Indians of Southern Mexico. 

Ethnographic albums have been issued be- 
fore ; but rarely if ever have they been satis- 
factory, partly because of a lack of material to 
make a good album and partly because the 
work of reproduction has been poorly done. 
Professor Starr, in a series of 141 plates re- 
produced from photographs selected from many 
hundreds, gives an idea of the general appear- 
ance of the people of thirteen tribes, of their 
villages, homes, and occupations. The work of 
reproduction is excellent : almost none of the 
sharpness of outline and definiteness of detail 
of the original photographs is lost. Thirty-two 
pages of text are included to explain the plates. 
This publication will soon be followed by a 
paper by Professor Starr, descriptive of the 
daily life and industries of the people illus- 
trated in the album, which will add greatly to 
the interest and value of the present work.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

In such a series as that of " Heroes 
of . the Nations " (Ptnam), a life of 
Oliver Cromwell was pretty sure to 
appear sooner or later : so it is perhaps a mere coin- 
cidence that Mr. Charles Firth's " Oliver Cromwell 
and the Rule of the Puritans in England " should 
be given to the public at the same time with Mr. 



Morley's narrative in " The Century " and that of 
Mr. Roosevelt in " Scribner's." Careful readers 
and interested students will peruse all three of these, 
and will understand something of the fascination 
which the life and work of the Protector have exer- 
cised on such widely variant natures as Carlyle and 
Gardiner and Morley and Firth in England, and 
Roosevelt and S. H. Church in America. Mr. 
Charles Firth is not a genius like Carlyle, nor a lit- 
erary master like John Morley ; but in all matters 
where patient research and a real instinct for get- 
ting at the truth are involved, he is an authority 
whom other writers are glad to quote. The book 
before us is an expansion of Mr. Firth's article in 
the " Dictionary of National Biography," written in 
1888 ; but it embodies the results of later researches 
and of recently discovered documents. The narra- 
tive is an abridged but adequate account of the great 
events which made epical the twenty years between 
1640 and 1660. Mr. Firth's estimate of Crom- 
well's character is candid, tinged though it be with 
sympathetic admiration. The summary of his work 
which forms the concluding paragraph is worth 
quoting : " Cromwell remained throughout his life 
too much the champion of a party to be accepted as 
a national hero by later generations, but in serving 
his Cause he served his Country too. No English 
ruler did more to shape the future of the land he 
governed, none showed more clearly in his acts the 
- plain heroic magnitude of mind.' " The book is 
unusually rich in illustrations over forty of them, 
seven being portraits (of one kind or another) of 
Cromwell. There are seven maps, prepared by 
Mr. B. V. Darbishire under Mr. Firth's direction, 
to illustrate important campaigns or battles. Two 
of these "differ considerably" (as the author says 
in his preface) " from those generally accepted as 
correct." It may be added that Mr. Morley, in his 
account of Marston Moor, accepts Mr. Firth's plan 
as the most trustworthy. In the plan to illustrate 
the battle of Naseby (to face p. 128) the draughts- 
man seems inadvertently to have confused the posi- 
tions of "Parliamentarians" and "Royalists" by 
misplacing the devices employed to indicate the 
respective armies. The book will take its place in 
Cromwellian literature as a clear, impartial, and 
authoritative presentment of one of the most fruitful 
epochs in the history of self-government, and of the 
all-compelling man who was its central figure. 

Lovers of Robert Louis Stevenson 
find the life of the man as interest- 
ing as his books ; and Mr. L. Cope 
Cornford, in his volume of biography and criticism 
of Stevenson (Dodd, Mead & Co.), has made a very 
engaging sketch of an attractive personality. In 
his preface, the author disclaims any attempt to 
write the full story of Stevenson's life, satisfying 
himself with a "study of his finished achievement, 
and of his personality and temperament as expressed 
in that achievement "; and this study he has made 
with fine sympathy and careful critical discrimina- 



Stevensori's 
romantic life.

tion. Discussing Stevenson's philosophy in the 
chapter on " The Moralist," he finds courage the 
last word of that philosophy ; hut somehow through 
it all is " the want of some kindly, indefinable, hu- 
man quality," and he deepens our impression that 
Stevenson was one who, by reason of his courage, 
played a little too lightly and buoyantly over the 
surface of things. For a time, perhaps, in our de- 
light in his romancing, we were inclined to glorify 
Stevenson beyond the warrant of his work ; and it 
is therefore all the more pleasant to find Mr. Corn- 
ford's appreciation balanced by so sane a judgment. 
In conclusion he says : " But with all Stevenson's 
brilliant endowment and all his amazing cleverness, 
the sane, serenely humorous vision of the great 
masters is denied him." What those brilliant en- 
dowments were, he sets before us with a very pleas- 
ing literary art of his own. In the chapters on 
"The Romanticist," "The Novelist," and "The 
Limner of Landscape," he discusses with surprising 
fulness (since the chapters are not long) the dis- 
tinctive characteristics of Stevenson's work, and his 
limitations. The wonderful versatility of the man 
is the most striking thing in the impression which 
these chapters make, and the range of his achieve- 
ment comes up pretty clearly in this account of it. 
Something of the color that vibrates in the pages 
of " The Master of Ballantrae " or " The Wrecker " 
has found place in the book. Though a volume of 
but two hundred pages, it contains about as much 
as the ordinary reader will care to know about 
Stevenson, and no reader will think it a word too 
long. 

It has been remarked, by Mr. Her- 

carVS^Ln. bert S P 6DCer and . Other8 > that 
spend our youth in learning every 

sort of thing except the supremely important one 
that of taking care of the coming generation. Prob- 
ably no parent has entered into the joys of parent- 
hood prospectively without an earnest search 
through the literature of the day to find some book 
that will set forth the rule of conduct in such case 
made and provided at least no parent who is ac- 
customed to go to books for information. For the 
most part, such a quest has been vain ; all the in- 
telligence which school and college has sharpened 
into acuteness stands dulled before the immutable 
and mysterious facts of nature ; and we boasting 
moderns take up our duties as fathers and mothers 
in the same tentative, empirical, impractical way 
that befalls all mankind after it leaves the safe har- 
bor of savagery and invincible ignorance. False 
modesty, what White called "prurient prudery," 
the hypocrisy of Anglo-Saxonry, and the lack of 
real civilization, combine to keep us from our duty 
and our rightful inheritance. In this emergency, 
Dr. Nathan Oppenheim steps forward for the third 
time with " The Care of the Child in Health " 
(Macmillan), and with courage enough to begin 
his suggestions for the care of the child when the 
child's life begins, and not after it is too late for 



the mother to avail herself of some simple direc- 
tions which will add greatly to her peace of mind 
and to the future happiness of the child itself. The 
book is not filled with veiled suggestions which will 
serve to keep it under lock and key to become a 
fearful joy to the youngster who chances upon it 
later ; rather is it a book of facts to be kept where 
all the family can read it and do what they can to 
make amends for the lack which Mr. Spencer has 
observed in us. Though the latest in point of time 
of Dr. Oppenheim's excellent treatises, it precedes 
them in the facts discussed, and serves as a scien- 
tific introduction to them as to the facts of parent- 
hood. 

Hard realities Mr - Karl Irvin g Faust's rather elab- 
of warfare in orately gotten up volume entitled 
the Philippines. Campaigning in the Philippines " 
(Hicks-Judd Co., San Francisco) is frankly a com- 
pilation, by no means altogether of stale matter 
however, and the fact that its contents are largely 
from the pens of men who were active participants 
in the events described lends it a certain interest. 
The graphic quality of the book is enhanced by the 
numerous illustrations after photographic snap-shots 
taken largely at the scene of action, and in some 
instances under conditions arduous enough, one 
would think, to baffle the ingenuity or cool the 
courage of the most enterprising " camera fiend." 
Let us add that the ghastly objects shown in some 
of these plates the trenches choked with corpses, 
and courtyards covered with mangled trunks and 
torn disjecta membra, and so on, should suffice 
to chill the martial ardor of the most strenuous. 
The compiler of the volume went out to Manila in 
December, 1898, to collect data for an account of 
the military operations then thought to be virtually 
over. Arriving at Manila on the eve of the out- 
break of the trouble with our late allies, Mr. Faust 
saw that the scope of the projected book must be 
enlarged, so as to include accounts of the new cam- 
paigns then evidently impending. A staff of writers 
was therefore organized to follow up the move- 
ments of the troops in the field, and the cooperation 
of competent men in the various regiments was ar- 
ranged for. The result of this enterprise is a 
melange of descriptive and statistical matter that 
undoubtedly contains a fair amount of the raw ma- 
terial of history proper. The editor has evidently 
tried to get at the truth as far as possible, as well 
as to make a readable and salable book. A supple- 
mentary chapter sketches the history of the Philip- 
pines and their people, and there are some useful 
maps. The lack of an index seriously impairs its 
value as a book of reference. 

Mr. Edmund Hamilton Sears's 
" Outline of Political Growth in the 
Nineteenth Century" (Macmillan) 
is not very happily named : it might better have 
been called an " Outline of Political History," or 
something of that sort. The author explains, in 
his preface, that he wished to emphasize the growth

of popular institutions, which he has done ; but the 
words " political growth " do not necessarily con- 
vey this idea. From this point of view, he should 
have called his work an "Outline of Democratic 
Growth " or of the " Growth of Democracy." The 
conception of the work is a good one, and its execu- 
tion is in some particulars meritorious. The book 
shows reading, if not original investigation which, 
however, is not claimed but disclaimed ; and the 
arrangement and handling of the material show 
grasp of the subject. A very large amount of use- 
ful information relating to an important topic is 
brought into convenient compass. But, we regret 
to say, this information cannot always be implicitly 
accepted. For example, in dealing with the Home 
Rule controversy in England, the author makes all 
Home Rulers Irishmen, thus confounding them 
with the Irish Nationalists ; while he says Mr. 
Gladstone's retirement from office and public life 
was "owing to the formation of a cataract in his 
eyes." The ten-line personal sketch of President 
Garfield contains two positive errors. Garfield did 
not, as asserted, " abandon the law to serve, first in 
the army, and afterwards in Congress "; neither 
was he, at the time of his nomination for the Presi- 
dency, serving in the Senate. Garfield's law prac- 
tice all followed his entry into Congress, and he 
never served in the Senate at all, although he was 
chosen a member of that body the winter before he 
was elected President. 



A -wheel in 
Normandy. 



Tourists who know Normandy only 
through its fashionable watering- 
places and its one or two larger his- 
toric towns will find Mr. Percy Dearmer's valuable 
little book, "Highways and Byways in Normandy" 
(Macmillan), in its way a revelation. Mr. Dear- 
mer's scholarly descriptions are copiously illustrated 
by the delightful drawings of Mr. Joseph Pennell, 
whose pencil is very much at home in depicting the 
picturesque nooks and corners and unspoiled archi- 
tectural charms of the quaint old Norman towns. 
For those who desire to explore and to know Nor- 
mandy, to get away from the beaten track of the 
" personally conducted " tourist, this is assuredly 
the book. Not that Mr. Dearmer has by any means 
exhausted the riches of this lovely corner of France. 
His trip was made a-wheel, and he cheerfully ad- 
mits that " it would be easy to leave the route that 
is here suggested at almost any point and discover 
fresh country." In Mr. Dearmer's narrative, if 
such it can properly be called, the personal note is 
not conspicuous, the space being devoted mainly to 
objective description of the country passed through. 
Much desirable information as to the historic asso- 
ciations and past of notable towns and buildings is 
interspersed. There is a folding map showing the 
author's route, and Mr. Pennell's very tasteful 
drawings serve to illustrate as well as adorn this 
capital descriptive and historical guide to the tempt- 
ing region explored by Mr. Dearmer. 



Recollections 
of Presidential 



Colonel A. K. McClure is a veteran 
of American politics. He has ac- 
^ y ^ participated in fourteen Presi- 
dential contests, or nearly half of the entire number. 
In the Republican National Convention of 1860 he 
played a prominent part, leading, with Mr. Curtin, 
the " break " of his delegation from Cameron to 
Lincoln. In the ensuing campaign he was chair- 
man of the State Committee. In addition to his 
experience, Colonel McClure has made a life-long 
study of the history and methods of American poli- 
tics, especially of the great quadrennial contests for 
the Presidency. He now embodies the information 
thus gained in 'a volume of some 400 pages, entitled 
"Our Presidents and How We Make Them" 
(Harper), which aims to narrate succinctly yet 
readably the story of each Presidential campaign, 
down to and inclusive of that of 1896. Upon the 
inside history of those campaigns in which Colonel 
McClure personally took part some interesting side- 
lights are shed. The text is brightened with an 
occasional anecdote. The book is, all things con- 
sidered, commendably impartial, and contains much 
information of the sort that an active political ex- 
perience can best supply. There are twenty-five 
portraits, including one of the author. 



Dr. E. E. Hale 
on Emerson. 



Dr. Edward Everett Hale writing of 
Emerson could hardly fail to be 
interesting, and though his book is 
not very thick, containing only an address of some 
fifty-three pages by the author and two early essays 
of Emerson's, the address itself, is pure gold and 
the essays are more than interesting. Little per- 
sonal touches that bring us near to the warm human 
nature of the transcendental philosopher crop out 
on every page, and his figure grows larger for us as 
we realize more fully the range of his sympathies. 
It is refreshing to read accounts of his efforts to 
hold the Town and Country Club to practical aims, 
and equally so to read of his getting up in the dim 
midnight to soothe and comfort two lonely boys, like 
himself guests in a strange house. " He was what 
his own New England had made him. And this 
was a child of God who chose to go to God for 
instructions. . . . And no interpretation of that 
word by any of these aides brothers and sisters 
of his could turn him from the Father. This is 
the secret of the power of Emerson." Slight as it 
is, all lovers of Emerson will want the book, with 
its revealings of the inner spirit of the loftiest figure 
in American letters. (Brown & Co.)

ical and critical, essential to a right understanding 
of Rabelais and his work. Sir Thomas Urquhart's 
rendering of the immortal tales of Gargantua and 
Pantagruel, first issued in 1653, occupies a posi- 
tion immeasurably above any other English version. 
It is, as Mr. Whibley says, " a translation, unique 
in its kind, which has no rival in profane letters. 
Indeed it can scarcely be called a translation at all ; 
rather it is the English Rabelais. . . . He [Urqu- 
hart ] was, in a sense, Rabelais incarnate." The 
mechanical form of this new edition is in keeping 
with previous volumes of the " Tudor Transla- 
tions," that is to say, the volumes are models of 
typographical dignity and excellence: It is certain 
that Rabelais was never before presented to English 
readers in so satisfactory and attractive a form. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In " Paris As It Is " (Doubleday, Page & Co.) Miss 
Katherine de Forest has given us a very readable book, 
which, in spite of the disclaimer of its preface, will 
convey a good deal of information to the average reader 
and probably contribute in its way something toward a 
better appreciation of French life. Her account of what 
she has seen is sprightly and enlivened with anecdotes 
not always new but generally good. When she drops 
into philosophy of art or literature she shows to less 
advantage. Her ambition to " interpret the genius of 
Paris " must not lead one to expect anything that may 
be compared with the chapters of Mr. Hamerton or 
Mr. Browuell. There are some excellent pictures, and 
the book is neatly printed and bound. Unfortunately, 
the proof-reading is atrocious. The foreign names and 
phrases which liberally besprinkle the pages appear 
under horrible disguises; the blunders here are some- 
times of a character to make us suspect the complicity 
of the author. 

The latest " Temple Classics " (Macmillan) to reach 
us form a group of exceptionally attractive titles in a 
series which is uniformly attractive. They comprise a 
two-volume edition of Goldsmith's " A Citizen of the 
World," with notes by Mr. Austin Dobson; the " Silex 
Scintillans, or Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations " 
of Henry Vaughan; Cowper's "The Task"; Carlyle's 
"Heroes and Hero- Worship"; Matthew Arnold's 
4t Narrative, Elegiac, and Lyric Poems," edited by Mr. 
H. Buxton Forman, with the Watts portrait as frontis- 
piece and including the famous first-edition preface; 
and, finally, Vols. I. and II. in a seven-volume edition 
of William Caxton's " The Golden Legend, or Lives of 
the Saints." 

The following modern language text-books are the 
latest that we have received: "Journalistic German," 
being " selections from current German periodicals " 
(American Book Co.), edited by Dr. August Prehn; 
"Les Fautes du Langage" (Jenkins), by Mr. Victor 
F. Bernard; " Progressive Exercises in Spanish Prose 
Composition " (Holt), by Mr. M. Montrose Ramsey and 
Miss Aneta Johnstone Lewis; and Herr Sudermann's

of Dr. Richard T. Ely's "Outlines of Economics." 

" How to Recite " is a school speaker, edited by Mr. 
F. Townsend South wick, and published by the American 
Book Co. 

Mrs. Humphry Ward's " Helbeck of Bannisdale " has 
just been reissued, two volumes in one, by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

Mr. David Nutt, London, publishes a pamphlet en- 
titled " Peasant Lore from Gaelic Ireland," collected by 
Mr. Daniel Deeney. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish the " Elements of Al- 
gebra," by Messrs. W. W. Beman and D. E. Smith, as 
a text-book for secondary schools. 

Mr. M. F. Mansfield publishes a reprint of "The 
Mutiny on Board H. M. S. Bounty," from the original 
narrative of Lieutenant William Bligh. 

The Macmillan Co. have just published a third edition 
of Mr. Henry Wallace's " Letters to the Farm Boy," a 
book which has had a wide popular success. 

Mr. Robert Luce, Boston, is both author and pub- 
lisher of "Going Abroad? Some Advice," a small 
volume first issued three years ago, and now reproduced 
in a new edition. 

Twenty lives, by Cornelius Nepos, edited by Mr. 
John Edmund Barss, and published by the Macmillan 
Co., form a volume which is a welcome addition to Latin 
texts suitable for beginners. 

A condensation for young readers of " The Chronicles 
of Sir John Froissart, made by Mr. Adam Singleton, is 
a most welcome reading-book for schools recently pub- 
lished by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

" The World's Work " is the title of a new magazine 
to be published in the Fall by Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co., under the editorship of Mr. Walter H. Page, 
formerly editor of " The Forum " and " The Atlantic." 

A new illustrated edition of Carlyle's " French Revo- 
lution," in a single thick volume, has recently been 
imported by the Messrs. Scribner. The illustrations 
are full-page plates, fifteen in number, reproductions of 
old prints. 

A new edition of Miss Cholmondeley's " Diana Tem- 
pest," recalled to favor by the success of her more re- 
cent " Red Pottage," is published by Messrs. Harper & 
Brothers. It includes a portrait and a biographical 
sketch of the author. 

The official illustrated catalogue of the American fine 
arts exhibit at the Paris Exposition, as published by 
Messrs. Noyes, Platt, & Co., makes a small and neat 
volume, and is given particular attractiveness by the 
half hundred full-page plates at the end of the book. 

A new edition of " The Story of Grettir the Strong," 
as translated from the Icelandic over thirty years ago 
by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson, has just 
been published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. in 
their uniform library edition of the writings of Morris. 

" Pausanias, and Other Greek Sketches " is the title 
of a volume by Mr. J. G. Frazer, just published in 
" Eversley " form by the Macmillan Co. It consists 
for the most part of matter reprinted from the author's 
monumental edition of Pausanias. The essay which 
served that edition as an introduction fills the first 
hundred and sixty pages of this volume, and is here fol- 
lowed by nearly a hundred brief descriptive sketches 



1900.]

selected from the author's commentary on Pausanias. 
His " Encyclopaedia Britaunica " article on " Pericles " 
closes this collection of essays. 

Milton's " Paradise Lost," I. and II., De Quincey's 
" Opium Eater," and Scott's " Lady of the Lake," are 
three new volumes of the " Pocket English Classics" 
published by the Macmillan Co. The respective editors 
are Mr. W. I. Crane, Dr. Arthur Beatty, and Miss 
Elizabeth A. Packard. 

Messrs. Davis & Co., Chicago, are the publishers of 
The Crucifixion," by Mr. William T. Stead. The book 
is a sort of religious novel dealing with the last days in 
the life of Jesus, and intended as a sort of commentary 
upon the play at Oberammergau. It is written in Mr. 
Stead's most approved style of sensational journalism. 

"The Young Folks' Cyclopaedia of Persons and 
Places," by Mr. John Denison Champlin, is published 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. in a third and revised 
edition. The original work is now twenty years old, 
and the revision has occasioned many changes, including 
the preparation of more than five hundred new articles. 

New reading-books sent us by the American Book 
Co. in their " Eclectic " series are the following : " Dis- 
coverers and Explorers," by Mr. Edward R. Shaw; 
" Alice's Visit to the Hawaiian Islands," by Miss Mary 
H. Krout; the "Story of Ulysses," by Mr. M. Clarke; 
and The True Citizen," by Dr. W. F. Markwick and 
Mr. W. A. Smith. 

" Robert Browning," by Mr. Arthur Waugh, and 
41 John Wesley," by Mr. Frank Banfield, are the first 
two volumes in the series of " Westminster Biographies," 
published by Messrs. Small, Maynard, & Co. These 
biographies are similar in size and appearance to those 
of the " Beacon " series, and are to deal similarly with 
famous modern Englishmen. 

" The Story of Captain Meriwether Lewis and Cap- 
tain William Clark for Young Readers," retold in simple 
prose by Miss Nellie F. Kingsley, is a recent publication 
of the Werner School Book Co., who also send us " Four 
American Pioneers,"a reading-book about Boone, George 
Rogers Clark, Crockett, and Kit Carson, prepared by 
Miss Frances M. Perry and Miss Katharine Beebe. 

" Exhibition Paris, 1900," is a practical guide pub- 
lished by Messrs. F. A. Stokes Co. in connection with 
Mr. William Heinemann, of London. The opening 
chapter, on " how to see Paris in one day for forty-five 
francs," should appeal irresistibly to hurried Americans. 
By this feature, as well as by many others, the book 
unquestionably earns its title of a " practical " manual. 

The Macmillan Company have in preparation an 
edition de luxe of the works of Walter Pater, in eight 
volumes. The edition will be limited to 775 copies, 
250 of which will be reserved for America. The first 
volume, " Studies in the History of the Renaissance," 
will be issued iu September, followed by monthly vol- 
umes, the last of which, " Miscellaneous Studies," will 
be issued in April, 1901. 

The Hon. Mellen Chamberlain, jurist, librarian, and 
author of numerous essays and reviews on historical 
subjects, died in Boston on the 25th of last month in 
his eightieth year. He was both lawyer and judge be- 
fore he became librarian of the Boston Public Library, 
which position he left about ten years ago, and since 
then has given his time to literary work, of which his 
volume entitled "John Adams, the Statesman of the 
American Revolution " is perhaps the best known ex- 
ample.

COLUMBUS IN CUBA. 



At the present time, when we are coming into closer relations with 
Cuba than ever before, few things could possess greater interest for our 
students of history than the account given by Columbus himself of his 
discovery and exploration of the historic and beautiful island in 1492. 
The directors of the Old South Work have rendered a distinct service 
in printing as one of their Old South Leaflets the passages from the 
Journal of Columbus in which this account is given. This is No. 102 in 
the series, in which for the mere cost of printing, 5 cents a copy, our 
schools and the people are being furnished with so many original his- 
torical documents. Three valuable Columbus leaflets have already 
appeared in the series : The Account of the Discovery of America, from 
the Life of Columbus by his son, Ferdinand Columbus; Columbus's 
Letter to Gabriel Sanchez, describing the First Voyage ; and Colum- 
bus's Memorial to Ferdinand and Isabella, sent from Hayti in 1494.

AN EPIC OF THE WEST. 

THE GIRL AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE 

A Story of the Plains. By E. HOUGH, author of "The Story of the Cowboy." 12mo, cloth, 31.50. 
A dramatic picture of a battle which has been compared to scenes in " The Red Badge of Courage," opens the story. 
After this " Day of War " there comes " The Day of the Buffalo." The reader follows the course of the hero and his 
friend, a picturesque old army veteran, to the frontier, then found on the Western plains. The third part of the story is 
called "The Day of the Cattle," and the fourth part of the story "The Day of the Plow." Nothing has been written 
on the opening of the West to excel this romance in epic quality, and its historic value, as well as its freshness, vividness, and 
absorbing interest, should appeal to every American reader. 

PINE KNOT 

A Story of Kentucky Life. By WILLIAM E. BARTOX, author of " A Hero in Homespun." 

Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The story is full of the atmosphere of the quaint mountain life with its wealth of amusing peculiarities, and it also has 
a historical value, since it pictures conditions attendant upon the anti-slavery movement and the days of the war. The 
interest of a treasure search runs through the tale, since the author has adroitly utilized a mountain legend of a lost mine. 
" Pine Knot " is a romance " racy of the soil " in a true sense, a story fresh, strong, and absorbing in its interest throughout. 

IN CIRCLING CAMPS 

A Romance of the American Civil War. By J. A. ALTSHELER, author of " A Herald of the West," 

" A Soldier of Manhattan," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Mr. Altsheler has an enviable reputation. His method is that of Fenimore Cooper. He tells a good, strong, human 
story for its own sake and not for the sake of showing off his talent as a literary story-teller. He gives us some great 
battle pieces, notably Shiloh and Gettysburg. His admiration of the nobler qualities of ' old friends turned foes ' is so 
hearty and so sincerely dramatic that we love and pity the terrible valor of both." RICHARD HKNRY STODDARD in 
The New York Mail and Express.

This new edition of "The Red Badge" is issued in re-

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

i. 

In pursuance of our custom of several years' 
standing, we have summarized for this and the 
succeeding issue of THE DIAL the reports made 
to the London " Athenaeum " by the foreign 
correspondents of that journal, upon the liter- 
ary history of the last twelvemonth in the sev- 
eral countries of Continental Europe. Our 
acknowledgments are once more due to our 
English contemporary for the material herewith 
presented. The reports for the present year 
include twelve countries, the only noticeable 
omissions being Greece, Portugal, and Sweden. 
We present our summary by countries, in 
alphabetical order, following the example set 
by the " Athenaeum." 

Professor Paul Fredericq writes of Belgium, 
and begins with mention of E. Banning'* 
posthumous " Reflexions Morales et Poli- 
tiques." The author was a diplomat and a 
student of political science, not unlike Laveleye 
in the range of his interests. 

" The French poets and prose authors of Belgium 
who enjoy a reputation outside their country are becom- 
ing naturalized in France in increasing numbers. MM. 
Maeterlinck, Camille Lemonnier, Eeckhoud, and Roden- 
bach the last died at Paris last year have even 
settled in the French capital, which now sends forth 
their books instead of Ghent or Brussels or Antwerp. 
M. Lemonnier has published two novels, ' Une Femme ' 
and 'Au Co3ur Frais de la ForeV; M. Maeterlinck 
continues his series of philosophical compositions with 
' Le Mystere de la Justice.' A collection of Roden- 
bach's work has appeared under the title of ' L'Elite,' 
containing the portraits of the authors and artists of 
the day whom he considered the best." 

In Belgium, we are told, " the theatre lives 
almost entirely on pieces from France." There 
are, however, a few Belgian pieces, the most 
important of them being " Le Cloitre," by M. 
Verhaeren. A work of timely interest is the 
" Pays des Boers " of M. Leclercq, who visited 
South Africa just before the war. In their 
"Controverse Transvaalienne," MM. Abel and 
Christophe "have gathered the arguments for 
both sides as they appear to Belgians," where 
the Boers are generally favored by public 
opinion. M. Henri Pirenne's " Histoire de 
Belgique," now published in French, has made 



66 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



a considerable sensation, although it has not 
got beyond the fourteenth century. There are 
many other contributions to national history 
besides this. In Flemish literature nothing 
very remarkable seems to have been published, 
unless we except " Te Lande," a volume of 
sketches by Mr. Cyriel Buysse. 

" Flemish literature, which began by being at first 
merely popular and poetical, is gradually becoming 
learned. The professors of our universities are begin- 
ning to write their books in their mother tongue. . . . 
The Flemish even dream of forming at Ghent a uni- 
versity of their own, like the Slav University the Czechs 
of Bohemia have had for some years at Prague. What- 
ever comes of the scheme, no one can deny that the 
level of Flemish literature is gradually but surely rising 
year by year." 

Finally, mention is made of two small works 
interesting to English scholars " The En- 
glish Faust-Book of 1592," edited by Professor 
Logeman ; and " Was Dachte Shakespeare 
iiber Poesie?" by M. Paul Hamelius. 

Mr. V. Tille, writing of Bohemia, begins by 
saying : 

" In all branches of mental activity, Bohemia is mak- 
ing fresh starts, energetic attempts at novel forms and 
developments. The older generation is passing away, 
people who in their day have done their duty in different 
departments of science and literature; but we are still 
waiting for a man capable of shaping something new 
out of the chaos of modern tendencies. For this reason 
also, the majority of our authors' tendencies are char- 
acterized by general rather than by individual quali- 
ties, and only very few books rise above the average 
level." 

In serious writing, mention is made of some 
works on the development of civilization and of 
art, besides studies in literary criticism, such as 
Mr. Vrchlicky's " Chapters on Recent French 
Fiction," and Mr. Vlcek's " History of Our 
Poetry." But in general, " literary criticism 
shows a great lack of depth and elaboration, 
yet at the same time plenty of cursory studies 
and interesting struggles between the several 
tendencies of our younger writers. A large 
systematic work on the history of universal 
literature is in preparation, but as yet nothing 
can be said about its execution." Literature 
proper is summarized in a few such sentences 
as the following : 

" The older authors who have already secured hon- 
ourable places in the history of our literature remain 
quiet, and are mostly occupied in publishing collections 
of their own works. ... A kind of fiction cultivated 
in Bohemia with uncommon predilection is the tale of 
popular life, embracing scenes from the life of Bohe- 
mian peasantry, directly drawn from different parts of 
the country. . . . Dramatic literature is now on the 
eve of a new era caused by the change in the working 
of the national theatre in Prague. The management 



passes this year into the hands of a new society consist- 
ing of the foremost men in the literary and financial 
world." 

The plays which have made the most stir have 
been Mr. Svoboda's " Passion Flowers " and 
" The Uprooted Oak," and Mr. Hilbert's " The 
Exiles," which has been published but not yet 
produced. 

The report from Denmark is contributed by 
Dr. Alfred Ipsen, who says, among other 
things, that a new collected edition of Dr. 
Brandes has just been published ; that Profes- 
sor Hansen is bringing out a second edition of 
his monumental "History of Danish Litera- 
ture "; that Herr Julius Clausen is editing a 
literary history of the world on a plan similar 
to that of the English series in charge of Pro- 
fessor Gosse ; and that a large new " History 
of the Danish Kingdom," by many hands, is 
now in course of publication. Herr Drach- 
mann's " Hellige lid " (Sacred Fire), written 
during his American sojourn, is probably the 
most noteworthy literary production of the 
year. " Carit Etlar," not long before his 
death, published a story of old-time Norway 
entitled " Bjorneset," highly romantic in color- 
ing and treatment. Herr Skjoldborg's " Krage- 
huset " " presents a picture of peasant life on 
the western coast of Jutland. He knows the 
peasants there as scarcely any other man does, 
being himself settled among them as a teacher." 
Other works of fiction are " Lykke-Peer," by 
Herr Pontoppidan, which is largely autobio- 
graphical ; " The Sins of the People," by Mr. 
Gyrithe Lemche, which treats of a delicate 
subject, but not with sensational intent ; and 
" Before the Portal of Death," by Herr Ed- 
vard Egeberg, " a most serious and momentous 
effort." In verse, Herr E. Blaumuller, a cler- 
gyman, has published a volume " in which a 
whole cycle of songs is devoted to Spinoza." 

" I must first consider various theatrical 
pieces of the year," says M. Jules Pravieux, 
writing of French literature. 

" We are tired, quite tired, of the brutal or bitter or 
immoral sort of piece. This style has become dreadfully 
commonplace. To do realism justice, it has rendered 
a real service to letters: it has done away with the cult 
of the vaudeville, which has had so many faithful fol- 
lowers since Scribe was its chief prophet. We have 
learnt to despise ingenious combinations, elaborate im- 
broglios. People have, it appears, an increasing fond- 
ness for ideas at the theatre ideas belonging to 
psychology, morals, philosophy, sociology. I will not 
go so far as to say that the French theatre is confined 
to idealism. The statement would be untrue, and this 
chronicle of the chief pieces will have to notice attempts 
of quite a different sort."

" Les Maris de Leontine," by M. Capus, and 
Le Pere Naturel," by MM. Dupre and Char- 
ton, are pieces in the style of refined vaude- 
ville, but they stand out as rather exceptional. 
A few problem plays are briefly characterized. 
M. Bruyere, in the piece called " En Paix," 
" attacks the law on the confinement of the 
insane," but makes of his theme " a deep-dyed 
melodrama." 

"M. Jacques Normand leads us to calmer regions. 
The problem he has intended to study in ' La Douceur 
de Croire ' is this: Have you the right to destroy faith 
if you have nothing to put in its place ? Reasoning is 
powerless to resolve problems whose essential elements 
are beyond reason. . . . M. Brieux in ' La Robe Rouge ' 
proves once more his lively gifts. He has exhibited in 
some scenes of real power the distortions of soul in a 
magistrate due to the professional spirit. M. Brieux 
in all his pieces puts before one the most pressing social 
and moral problems of the day with a keen sense of 
life, and his boldness is almost always crowned with 
success. He despises the common proceedings by 
which authors in vogue capture the applause of the 
gallery. . . . M. Hermant also looks out for ' actual ' 
subjects. He has given us ' L'Empreinte ' and ' Le 
Faubourg.' The first can be without hesitation reck- 
oned a ' piece a these.' ' L'Empreinte ' belongs to the 
daily increasing list of pieces against divorce. If one 
wished to be ironical, it would be pleasant to observe 
how the dramatists, after having advertised divorce, 
now seem to exert a keenness in fighting against it as 
great as the energy, audacity, and enthusiasm with 
which they celebrated its benefits. . . . Since the extra- 
ordinary success of ' Cyrano,' a passionate curiosity fol- 
lows the works of M. Rostand. In ' L'Aiglon ' he has 
resolutely left fiction alone, and the methods of Dumas 
the elder and Victor Hugo. His idea is, in a series of 
well-chosen scenes, to bring out the real figure of the 
son of Napoleon. He has made up for the absence of 
incident by a strong precise psychological analysis, thus 
imitating the great classics. M. Rostand has written 
an unequal, but splendid work, full of pathetic beauty, 
with a breath, at times, of Victor Hugo's epic genius. 
If he sins in any direction, it is in excessive facility, in 
the over-use of comparison and metaphor." 

"The tendencies of the poets are not very 
clearly defined," we are told. 

" Their common aim seems to be to put ideas into 
poetry, but broad ideas which are the expression of the 
most intimate personality, which render the deep vibra- 
tions resulting from being in contact with things and 
faced by the great enigma of life. The evolution of 
versification is going on. The romantic reform is being 
completed by the banishment of the last traces of 
caesura of the hemistich in the verses which are not ex- 
pressly formed on the classical type. The aim is to 
make verse still more supple, and capable of finer, more 
clearly expressive, harmonies." 

The most noteworthy volumes of recent poetry 
are " La Beaute de Vivre," by M. Fernand 
Gregh; "Les Medailles d'Argile," by M. 
Henri de Regnier; "Berthe aux Longs Pieds," 
by M. Andre Rivoire ; " La Legende Ailee de 
Wieland le Forgeron," by M. Viele Griffin ; 



" Fleurs de Corail," by M. Maurice Olivaint ; 
" Fleurs d'Hiver," by M. Armand Silvestre ; 
" Au Champs et au Foyer," by M. Achille 
Million ; " La Bretagne Enchantee," by M. 
Paul Sebillot ; and " La Charmille d'Or," by 
M. A. Joubert. 

" Our century is so infatuated with the novel that it 
is not strange to see novelists multiplying at a rate 
really frightful. . . . One fact is evident, for every 
year brings fresh proof of it: there is no school, a fact 
which cannot be regretted. Every one goes his own 
way follows his ideal, his own bent, as he chooses. 
Every one is innovating or imitating as his innate tem- 
perament or his lively affection directs." 

M. Bourget is becoming a moralist rather than 
a psychologist. 

"The time has come when simple undiluted state- 
ments of fact do not satisfy him. The study of the 
human heart leaves an uneasiness, and as by living near 
the sick one gets the desire to care for them, the psy- 
chologist is being moved with pity for the poor suffering 
souls whose wounds he examined at first with mere cu- 
riosity. Having seen souls suffer, he attempts to cure 
them with beliefs." 

These statements are illustrated by M. Bour- 
get's "Drames de Famille." 

" Nor do the brothers Margueritte, in their novel 
<Femmes Nouvelles,' aim at merely amusing their 
readers. They wish to oblige them to verify, and cor- 
rect some of the gravest errors, some of the worst in- 
justices, of our contemporary civilization. So their 
book, before being a work of art, is a social work." 

M. Barres, in " L'Appel au Soldat," has con- 
tinued the theme of his " Deracines." M. 
Rod's latest novel, " Au Milieu du Chemin," 
studies " the important question of the respon- 
sibility of the man of letters. The book de- 
rives a great beauty from the gravity of the 
subject alone, but the novel spoils the moral 
treatment." M. Marcel Prevost, in " Freder- 
ique " and " Lea," has attacked the " question 
feministe " " his characters are thrown into 
strong relief by his dramatic power, and their 
experiences are vividly related." Of M. Zola's 
" Fecondite " we are told that 
" One cannot help admiring the extraordinary powers of 
his imagination, the gift he has of creating great wholes, 
of painting crowds of stirring people all alive, thrilled, 
carried away by great movements, roused by great agita- 
tions to revolt. His novel is a poem, a highly realistic 
poem. Its descriptions are intense, brilliant, winding off 
into visions. It moves towards the organization of a vast 
allegory, disengaging more or less confusedly a social con- 
ception whose chief merit is not originality. The novel 
of M. Zola gives me a chance to note once more that the 
realist school, of which he is the chief, has seen its day. 
The preferences of young men entering letters are not 
for the literary doctrines of M. Zola, and few are the 
books which can be referred to realism, if one prefers 
naturalism." 

A few other novels are "La Double Mai-

tresse," by M. de Regnier ; " La Romance du 
Temps Present," by M. Leon Daudet ; " La 
Princesse de Lerne," by M. Ernest Daudet ; 
"Au Coaur Frais de la Foret," by M. Lem- 
onnier ; " Claudette," by M. Theuriet ; and 
" Sous la Tyrannie," by M. A. Filon. In lit- 
erary criticism, much praise is given to M. de 
Wyzewa for his persistent endeavor to make 
the French public acquainted with the modern 
works of other literatures. M. Ehrhard's work 
on Grillparzer and the Austrian theatre is com- 
mended, as well as M. Rebelliau's study of 
Bossuet. M. Emile Faguet continues the best 
traditions of French criticism. 

" He seems to steer clear carefully of general theo- 
ries, mere erudition, and anecdotes. He presents curi- 
ous studies of minds. His one aim is to distinguish and 
define the moral existences which are revealed by works, 
and all these mixtures of temperaments, intelligence, 
and affections are analyzed by him with fine precision. 
He has published this year two important works, 
L'Histoire de la Litte*rature Franchise ' and Politiques 
et Moralistes du XlXeme Siecle.' The former is nota- 
ble for immense learning, originality of view, abundance 
of ideas, and, above all, lucidity, wonderful distinctness 
of exposition." 

Memoirs of the First Empire abound this year 
as usual, and include a new volume by M. 
Frederic Masson. M. Alberic Neton devotes 
a thorough study to " Sieyes." M. Aulard 
has written a " Histoire Politique de la Revo- 
lution Fransaise." M. Victor du Bled has 
written a volume on " La Societe Franaise du 
XVIeme au XXeme Siecle." " For M. Ana- 
tole France, history is once again a muse, as 
she used to be when she charmed young hu- 
manity. In his book * Clio ' the past is exactly 
and scrupulously revived as imagination pic- 
tures it, and as it really was, without, however, 
losing the distinct charm of things death has 
sheltered from the ravages of time. Clearly 
under history must also be included Victor 
Hugo's posthumous * Choses Vues,' of which 
a new volume has been brought out by the ex- 
ecutors of the poet." Philosophy is represented 
by numerous works, among which M. Fouil- 
lee's " La France au Point de Vue Moral " is 
of the first importance. 

" In it he studies the press, politics, and religion, he 
inquires what this great word decadence,' which we 
utter so lightly, means. He puts at the end of his long 
study the remedies for the ills he has exhibited, attach- 
ing special importance to the grave question of national 
education. It is the work of a thinker and a moralist." 

Other books in this department are " Les 
Causes Sociales de la Folie," by M. G. L. 
Duprat; " Recherches sur 1'Esthetique et la 
Morale, "by M. Durand de Gros ; and "La Phil- 



osophic d'Auguste Comte," by M. Levy-Bruhl. 
Two books of interest to English readers are 
" Les Milliardaires Americains," by M. F. de 
Norvins, and " Newman et le Mouvement d'Ox- 
ford," by M. Thureau-Dangin. This year has 
also seen the appearance of the first volume of 
a long-awaited life of Louis Veuillot, by his 
brother. 

" At the end of this review the leading idea to be 
discovered in the literary effort of the year might be a 
subject for inquiry. Tendencies are confused, and the 
result of all this agitation and preparation of all sorts 
may be asked. If I can trust an eminent critic and 
authority, it is now all over with scientific literature, 
only an artistic literature can be produced. To-day it is 
all over with naturalism, as it was forty years ago with 
romanticism, and seventy years ago with classicism. 
The literature of the future will be a naturalism wid- 
ened by being reformed out of certain romantic and 
especially classic elements, a synthesis, as it were, of 
the three doctrines of art which our literature has 
evolved since the Renaissance." 

The persistence of the romantic tendency is 
the keynote of Herr Ernst Heilborn's account 
of the German literature of the past year. 

" Literary tendencies come and go, but that romantic 
undercurrent is enduring. What is designated as lit- 
erature and, dubbed as the < spirit of the age,' fills up 
the pages of our histories of literature is, after all, only 
the property of a few cultured persons. The great 
mass of the people, at any rate in Germany, remain 
untouched by it. They continue to lead their own intel- 
lectual life; and only those writers who strike the 
notes that find an echo in the popular range of feeling 
are able to conquer this tough and unwieldy mass, and 
so win their way ' to the people.' Now and then it 
happens that this undercurrent, which regularly reveals 
itself in the back-staircase novels and stories of the 
people, extends its dominion over literature proper 
of course, in some higher and purer manifestation. Or 
else the same mood may prevail among the cultured 
and the masses, though with different effects on the 
feelings. Such a period seems at hand. Unless all the 
signs are deceptive, we are steering towards a new 
romanticism." 

The indications of this drift are numerous, 
among them being the two here mentioned : 

" Next winter a theatre is to be opened in Berlin de- 
voted principally, if not exclusively, to a new romantic 
movement. Quite lately a series of lectures was given 
in one of the artistic salons of Berlin, with the expressed 
object of paving the way for interest in and compre- 
hension of romantic art." 

The drama occupies the forefront of the present 
discussion, and Herr Heilborn presents unusu- 
ally interesting summaries of the important 
plays of the year. 

" Gerhart Hauptmann's latest work, the farce 
' Schluck und Jau,' deals with quite a romantic sub- 
ject, familiar from one of the stories in the Arabian 
Nights ' as well as one of the plays by the Danish dram- 
atist Holberg; still more familiar in the Introduction 
to Shakespeare's ' Taming of the Shrew.' Two tipsy

tramps in the familiar instances there is only one 
are carried to a castle by a merry hunting party, and 
one of them on awakening from his fit of intoxication 
is made to fancy himself the lord. His companion has 
to play the part of his consort and to deceive his com- 
rade, who is the dupe. ... In sharp contrast to the 
broken-down drunkard are the members of the hunting 
party ; on their behalf Hauptmann has for the first time 
invented a dignified yet characteristic style, abounding 
in metaphor; even in the ' Versunkene Glocke ' there 
was too great a tendency to allusiveuess." 

Herr Max Halbe's new play, " Das Tausend- 
jjihrige Keich," has for its subject " the old 
dream that Christ would come again to estab- 
lish an earthly kingdom of happiness and 
gentle peace a conception which Christian- 
ity has taken over as a legacy from Judaism." 
The author " plants this dream in the heart of 
a man of the people, a village blacksmith. 
While famine prevails in the land and revolu- 
tionary bands are stirring up strife for this 
is the year 1848 this village blacksmith col- 
lects a company of the faithful, to await the 
coming of the Lord." In Herr Ludwig 
Fulda's " Das Schlaraffenland," 

" An apprentice to whom reality refuses all that his 
heart desires, and grants him only the objects of his 
aversion, enters Lazyland (Schlaraffenlaud) in a dream. 
There he meets with all his coveted delights sweet 
dreams and pretty girls. He even attains the honour 
of a throne in Lazyland. But in the midst of his bliss 
he discovers that work is a condiment which even the 
sweetest of dainties cannot dispense with. He tries to 
introduce work into Lazyland, and this leads to terrible 
disturbances, so that he is glad enough to wake up 
once more in the reality he had despised." 

Herr Georg von Ompteda is the author of 
" Worth," a one-act piece "which satisfies the 
most exacting demands in its simple and poetic 
expression." Compared with this little piece, 
" The play which is regarded as the great dramatic 
success of the year, Max Dreyer's ' Probekandidat,' ap- 
pears somewhat threadbare. It owed its success to its 
' purpose,' and this is laudable enough, but, like every 
other purpose, it tends to injure what is the chief aim 
of all art, the purely human interest ; in fact, it is truth 
that suffers. A young teacher during his probationary 
period expounds Darwinian views to the highest class 
in the natural history lesson. The school comes under 
clerical influence, the head master is a time-server, and 
the young probationer is called upon to retract his state- 
ments in a public lesson. The pressure of domestic 
circumstances compels him to consent; but when it 
comes to the point, and he looks into the clear eyes of 
his pupils, the truth overwhelms him with irresistible 
force, and instead of retracting, he confirms his pre- 
vious statements with greater emphasis. He is dismissed, 
he loses his sweetheart, but in his heart he feels a sense 
of victory, and the play ends with an epigram." 

Herr von Wildenbrach's new historic tragedy, 
" Die Tochter des Erasmus," is thus charac- 
terized : 



" Passionate love for German nationality and patriotic 
sentiment, for pure doctrine and unfettered belief, en- 
thusiasm for the capacity for enthusiasm, animates the 
whole play. Even the dramatic situation depends on 
it. Erasmus of Rotterdam appears as the cool, scep- 
tical critic; Hutten, at first his friend, is the enthusiast. 
Erasmus's daughter is naturally her father's true child, 
all reason and calm calculation; it is her love for Hut- 
ten that effects the great transformation in her. As 
his mistress she follows him into banishment and misery. 
At last the score has to be settled between his daughter 
and Erasmus, now grown an old man. Then she, the 
disgraced and abandoned in the eyes of the world, re- 
nounces him, and breaks her staff over him." 

Herr Heyse, at the age of seventy, has written 
a " Neues Marchenbuch," which is called the 
best product of his old age. The " tales are 
simple and unpretending, some of them only 
fresh versions or interpretations of old fairy 
tales ; but there is unusual grace in their form, 
and they are pervaded by a peculiar restrained 
humour accompanied by a tinge of sadness." 
Herr P. K. Rosegger's novel, "Erdsegen," 
takes us to a peasant's cottage among the au- 
thor's native mountains, and draws a sharp and 
too didactic contrast " between the patriarchal 
existence on mountain heights and life in a 
great city." 

"The same civilization which Rosegger desires to 
banish from his world becomes in Adolf Wilbrandt a 
refined intellectual culture, the force that sustains life. 
Wilbrandt, another distinguished representative of the 
older generation in our literature, delights in depicting 
as the leading figure of his stories an ideal of free, 
intellectual, ethical manhood, such as he cherishes in 
his own heart." 

He has published two stories, " Erika " and 
" Das Kind, " which embody this ideal. 
" Thekla Ludekind," by Herr W. von Polenz, 
" is an educational romance, of the kind that 
* Wilhelm Meister ' made popular in German 
literature, a book in which life itself plays the 
part of the educator." 

" The book is good, as marking an advance, not only 
in Polenz's own development, but also in the present 
position of our fiction as a whole. The same may be 
even more emphatically asserted of Georg von Omp- 
teda's novel ' Eysen.' Polenz bases his picture on the 
individual fortunes of one person, while Ompteda's 
1 Eysen ' rests on a broader basis. The book bears the 
characteristic sub-title Deutscher Adel urn 1900,' and 
describes the fortunes of a whole family, the von 
Eysens; but though the interest is equally directed to a 
variety of figures, artistic unity is by no means lacking." 

Herr Detlev von Liliencron has this year pub- 
lished a few new poems in the collection, 
" Nebel und Sonne." 

" He possesses a warm masculine temperament which 
carries one away; a daring humour which can make 
head against life pervades the elegiac atmosphere; and 
when his poems originate in mystic sentiment this mys 
ticism springs from true nature feeling. . . . There i

a curious contradiction about his moods, but no matter 
what their character, their effect is genuine." 

Other volumes of poetry are by Fraulein Anna 
Bitter and Herr Carl Spitteler. In literary 
criticism and miscellany, mention is made of 
Professor Grimm's " Fragmente," of Fraulein 
Kicarda Huch's " Aus der Friihzeit der Ro- 
mantik," of Herr Julius Rodenberg's " Jugen- 
derinnerungen," and of Ludwig Bamberger's 
posthumous " Erinnerungen." At the close of 
his discussion, the author reverts to his key- 
note, and says : 

" A new romantic movement is making way in art. 
Whether it will bear fruit who shall say? Yet to me it 
seems to originate in an awakening desire for greater 
depth and thoughtfulness, and the longing that still 
seeks timidly and hesitatingly for expression is a holi- 
day yearning after inner contemplation. If this be so, 
the fruits cannot fail to appear." 



COMMUNICA TION. 

WHO ARE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I take exception to a passage which I note in 
your issue of June 1 (pp. 442-443) in a paragraph 
entitled " The Fighting Englishman " ? The passage is 
as follows: " Dr. Fitchett's own pages must often enough 
traverse the assumption of his title [ How England 
saved Europe '] by showing how often, during the 
Napoleonic wars, it was not the English, but the Celts, 
the Scotch and Irish contingents of the British forces, 
that did the bulk of the fighting." This criticism would 
only be justified if the word English had in Dr. Fitch- 
ett's work a racial significance opposed to the word Celt. 
It has not, nor has it in current usage ; it connotes, on 
the contrary, all the inhabitants of the British Isles 
not merely those of the country south of the Cheviots 
and west of Offa's Dyke. It is as justifiable, historically, 
in this sense as the term French, which connotes popu- 
lation without a drop of Frankish blood in their veins, 
population speaking Celtic and Germanic languages, 
as well as population speaking a very different form of 
Romance from that known as French ; population, I may 
add, which within a very recent historical period were 
bitterly opposed to the hegemony of France proper. 
All modern nations are amalgams; it is practically 
impossible to devise a name which shall express every 
element of the amalgam ; it is inevitable that that ele- 
ment which takes the lead by virtue of position, supe- 
rior energy, and superior wealth (of all kinds), should 
impose its name. In the present case your criticism is 
the more unfortunate because it was England in the 
narrow sense in which you take the term rather than 
England in the larger sense (t. e., the British Isles) in 
which Mr. Fitchett takes it, which did "save Europe." 
So far as the power of Napoleon was shattered by fight- 
ing, it was shattered by sea-fighting, the partakers in 
which were almost entirely Englishmen in the narrower 
sense. But, as a matter of fact, it was the policy of 
stubborn and indomitable opposition to Napoleon, far 
more than the fighting by which it was supported, which 
ultimately won the day; and for this policy the specific- 
ally English portion of the British Isles was responsible. 



In the same paragraph, you continue: "To come 
nearer our own day, what sort of showing must Tommy 
Atkins proper (though outnumbering his foes four to 
one) have made against the hardy South African ranch- 
man without the support of the Scotch and Irish and 
Colonials ? " In the first place, if you deduct Scotch 
and Irish and Colonial troops from the British forces 
the residue does not outnumber the Boer forces " four to 
one," however low an estimate be made of the latter. 
In the second place, it is quite illusory to imagine that 
the territorial designations of our regiments imply ex- 
clusive connection with different localities. There are 
Londoners in Highland regiments, there are Irishmen 
and Highlanders in South " English " regiments. But 
thirdly (and this is a simple matter of fact) there has 
been no such distinction as you imply between the dif- 
ferent regiments ; the errors of conduct have been 
spread over the same area and that the whole of the 
army as the excellences of conduct. The " cockney " 
whom you decry (without, if I may urge, knowing any- 
thing about him) has fought quite as well as the man 
from Devon, or Tipperary, or Carnarvon, or Lanark, or 
Rosshire; just as well, but no better, and at times 
he has had to put up with nasty reverses equally with 
his " rural " or " Celtic " comrade. As a matter of 
fact, the " cockney " is by no means so largely repre- 
sented in the ranks of the British army as you seem 
to think, more 's the pity, perhaps, as he is, like the 
Parisian, a first-class fighting man, making up in ner- 
vous energy what he lacks in stamina. 

One more point: You speak of the " ludicrous failure 
of the English attempt to raise in the rural districts a 
corps of rough riders ' on the American model." You 
are misinformed on this matter. The attempt has not 
been a failure. The " Yeomanry " raised in all parts of 
the British Isles (it was the Irish corps which has suf- 
fered the chief reverse that has befallen this branch of 
the forces) has done excellent service and shown itself 
fully the equal of the American " Rough Riders." The 
latter were doubtless a gallant set of men and did their 
duty nobly ; but you must pardon my pointing out that 
they had to face an enemy pour rire, and that they, at 
least once, got themselves, as volunteer troops will, 
into such a position that, had they been opposed by ca- 
pable sharpshooters like the Boers, scarcely a man 
would have escaped. I am convinced that the Rough 
Riders would have borne themselves as bravely at Spion 
Kop or at Gettysburg as they did at Santiago; in either 
case they would have been exterminated, or they would 
have had to fall back, just as Pickett's magnificent 
corps had to do. The American army has such a superb 
history of real fighting that it seems inadvisable to 
dwell overmuch upon the military promenade in Cuba. 

May I add that, although an Englishman in the nar- 
rower sense of the word, nay, a cockney, and one who 
glories in the name, I have for twenty years urged, 
in season and out of season, the importance of recog- 
nizing and fostering every element in our mixed British 
population. In especial I have extolled and vindicated 
the importance of the Celtic element. Nor have I other 
than the warmest feeling for the English race in 
America. I look upon Lincoln as the greatest man 
produced by our common race in the nineteenth cen- 
tury; and I do think that some of his greatness is due 
to the blood derived ultimately from the British Isles, 
and from that portion of it to which you incorrectly, 
as I maintain would restrict the name England.

CHINA AND THE CHINESE.* 

Of the four profusely illustrated books in 
our present category, only one seems to have 
been gotten out with any reference to the ex- 
isting eruption in China. The Reverend Doctor 
Smith's highly interesting and instructive work 
has been in print for several months ; Miss 
Scidmore's bright and prejudiced book is the 
result of her many journeys and residences in 
the newly roused country ; while Mr. Colqu- 
houn's instructive volume is the product of 
long acquaintance with Oriental affairs, and 
has more diplomatic value than the others. 
All of them, it may be added, make it apparent 
that one sees in China much that one wishes to 
see, and correction of the personal equation is 
more than ordinarily needful if the truth is to 
be ascertained approximately, the realities be- 
neath the life of the Chinese remaining largely 
unexplored through ethnical miscomprehen- 
sions. 

" The Chinese Empire, Past and Present," 
is a book of encyclopedic scope. Many sources 
are drawn upon for a knowledge of the Middle 
Kingdom which is felt to be necessary in the 
present crisis. General Tcheng-Ki-Tong, Mili- 
tary Attache to the Imperial Chinese Legation 
in Paris ; the Very Reverend John Henry Gray, 
Archdeacon of Hong Kong ; the Reverend 
William C. Milne, with some less well-known 
persons, have been quoted extensively. The 
third chapter of the book brings the history of 
the country down to the immediate present, 
while the other chapters contain the elementary 
facts respecting the people and their customs 
which are taken for granted by the other 
writers under consideration. It will be found 
useful for those newly interested in the subject, 
but it sheds little light on the causes now at 
work to overthrow the whites and their recently 
acquired possessions. 

Miss Scidmore, the author of " China, the 
Long-Lived Empire," is possessed of a bouyant 
Americanism which is not as common as it

was once ; and a certain amused contempt for 
foreigners in general, and yellow-skinned for- 
eigners in particular, runs through her vivid 
pages. She gives a lively picture of the life 
led in Peking by Europeans connected with 
diplomacy, and from it may be obtained con- 
siderable light. Referring to the legations, 
she says : 

"All these official European residences are main- 
tained on a scale of considerable splendor, and the 
sudden transfers from the noisome streets to the beau- 
tiful parks and garden compounds, the drawing-rooms 
and ball-rooms, with their brilliant companies living and 
amusing themselves exactly as in Europe, are among 
the greatest contrasts and surprises of Peking. The 
picked diplomats of all Europe are sent to Peking, paid 
high salaries, and sustained by the certainty of promo- 
tions and rewards after a useful term at Peking all 
but the American minister. . . . The diplomats in exile 
lead a narrow busy life among themselves, occupied 
with their social amusements and feuds, often well 
satisfied with Peking after their first months of disgust, 
resentment, and homesickness, and even becoming sensi- 
tive to any criticism or disparagement of the place. . . . 

" For the nearly forty years that the fine flowers of 
European diplomacy have been transplanted to Peking, 
they have been content to wallow along this filthy Lega- 
tion Street, breathing its dust, sickened with its mud 
stenches, the highway before their doors a general sewer 
and dumping ground for offensive refuse of every kind. 
. . . ' We are here on sufferance, you know,' said the 
meek and lowly diplomats. 'We must not offend 
Chinese prejudices.' Moreover, all the legations would 
not subscribe to an attempted improvement fund, nor 
all unite in demanding that the Chinese should clean, 
light, pave, and drain Legation Street that jealousy 
of the great powers so ironically termed the Concert of 
Europe ' as much to blame for the sanitary situation in 
one corner of Peking as for affairs in Crete and Ar- 
menia." 

It is evident that Miss Scidmore has a 
hearty disgust for policies which lead the Eu- 
ropean ministers to humiliate themselves for 
the sake of gaining a slight temporary advan- 
tage for their countries respectively, through 
their complaisance. Here, Mr. Colquhoun 
brings more positive information to aid in an 
understanding of the situation, which will be 
referred to presently. 

For Li Hung Chang, Miss Scidmore enter- 
tains a real hostility. It is difficult to fathom 
Chinese methods at best, but no light is given 
by such a statement as this : 

The Russians chose Li Hung Chang, who had 
served them well before, and deserved a reward and an 
incentive for the future [to attend the Tsar's coronation 
ceremonies]. The Manchu enemies of the grand secre- 
tary, who hated him for the disasters attending the war 
[with Japan] he had protested against their inviting, 
hailed the idea of his going abroad. During his ab- 
sence they expected to undermine him thoroughly, never 
dreaming of the honors and distinction to be accorded 
the ' Grand Old Man of China,' the absurdities of adu-

ation which all Europe and America were to heap upon 
a deposed and discredited provincial governor, a Chinese 
politician out of a job. They were dumfounded and 
chagrined when reports of Li's triumphal progress 
reached China, and the cry was raised that the great 
tourist was assuming honors due a sovereign. . . . The 
United States, not first among Chinophile countries 
certainly, and whose regularly accredited ministers at 
Peking have received but the scantiest hospitality and 
very little courtesy from the individuals directing the 
Chinese government, spent thirty thousand dollars in 
United States gold entertaining this passed politician 
and ex-office-holder, and fairly outdid Europe in its 
abject attitude before this great hypnotizer." 

It is perhaps unfair to criticize the instruc- 
tion conveyed in a book which is certainly 
intended to be entertaining. Miss Scidmore is 
at her best in describing visits of ceremony 
to some Manchu ladies of the court or to the 
family of a provincial magnate of the Chinese 
race. The book is a beautiful one, and reada- 
ble in every sense. 

Mr. Colquhoun, whose " China in Trans- 
formation " will be recalled as a luminous book, 
is an indefatigable traveller and newspaper 
correspondent, and formerly held rank in the 
administration of affairs in Burmah and Ma- 
slionaland. He has recently made the long and 
arduous overland journey from Russia proper 
through Siberia to Peking, leaving the line of 
the new transcontinental railway, and forming 
estimates of Manchuria and other recently ac- 
quired Russian possessions which overthrow 
established opinions and indicate how rapidly 
the Tsar has been developing the deep and 
extensive policy of his imperial predecessors. 
A most instructive account of the vast sweep of 
the Cossack pioneers of empire through Asia 
serves as an introduction to the sudden acqui- 
sition of Port Arthur, which brings to a fitting 
close the Siberian policy of the Russians by 
furnishing them with an unfrozen port on the 
Pacific. But Manchuria and Liao Tung, 
though they enable the rulers of Muscovy to 
consider one definite aim fully accomplished, 
have only increased their appetite for more. As 
Mr. Colquhoun says, with convincing logic : 

"Attainment of the longed-for prize has given an 
added impetus of irresistible force to the ambition and 
enterprise of the Russians. Sweeping the hand across 
the map southward as far as the Great Wall, ' All that 
is ours!' they exclaim in astonishment, contemplating 
their extraordinary windfall ; and they are hastening to 
take full advantage of their good fortune, as is evi- 
denced by the phenomenal activity recently witnessed 
at Port Arthur, Talienwan, and in the Hinterland, where 
many thousands of Cossacks and large bodies of Chinese 
are employed on fortifications, harbors, and railways, 
and by the increased zeal and energy with which the 
Construction of the trans-Siberian railway is being car- 



ried on. Many Russians, indeed, more advanced in 
their views, already include Tientsin and Chefoo (that 
is to say, the whole Gulf of Pechihli), and even Peking. 
. . . The alignment of the railway has been several 
times shifted farther and farther to the southwest, 
following the rapid succession of diplomatic achieve- 
ments." 

From the general tone of the book it is evi- 
dent that the author holds Great Britain and 
the United States to have been hoodwinked in 
the game of grab by the zealous agents of the 
Tsar, joining the American cause with that 
of the British quite as a matter of course. He 
shows that Manchuria, set down as worthless 
by the deluded British, is worth as much as 
Canada for purposes of development, and is 
regarded as an earthly paradise by the Russians 
from the arctic North. A glance at the map 
will show what its possibilities are by way of 
advance, the Russians at Tsien Wei, on the 
great highway, being less than two hundred 
miles from the Chinese capital. The very 
possession of Mukden, the ancient seat of the 
Manchu power, gives the Tsar a prestige in 
the minds of the Chinese which is dangerous to 
the reigning family though the present de- 
termination of the long oppressed natives to 
rule themselves has apparently overthrown 
every European calculation, Russia's with the 
rest. 

Though recent events vitiate many of Mr. 
Colquhoun's conclusions respecting Chinese 
partiality for Russia, even to the point where 
the reader will suspect the author of exaggera- 
tion for the sake of awakening Great Britain 
to a realization of the facts, many of his sen- 
tences are illuminating, as, for example, 
these, taken from different portions of the book : 

" China has now passed into such a condition that 
indifference is no longer possible for her, neither will it 
be long possible for us. It is preeminently true in 
China that whoever is not for Britain is against her, 
and the alternative must soon be faced by the most 
reluctant of governments: shall they vindicate the inter- 
ests of the British and of the Anglo-Saxon race gen- 
erally vigorously, manfully, and straightforwardly, or 
submit to their being completely crushed by the powers 
who are pressing forward their own claims to the entire 
exclusion of those of Britain ? " 

" The policy of Germany in the Far East is, and must 
be, dependent on the basis of her world-policy a good 
understanding with Russia and it is idle for the British 
to expect Germany, now the neighbor of Russia in Asia, 
as in Europe, to depart from that programme. Her 
policy, like that of Japan, is opportunist, but, unlike 
Japan, she is committed by force of circumstances to 
Russia." 

" The most cursory glance at any map, showing the 
railway schemes and spheres of influence or interest, or 
whatever they may be called, of foreign powers, must

shatter any belief in a responsible or organic govern- 
ment iu China. The trail of the foreigner is on the 
land from north to south. The Western powers have 
come to stay, and the extension of the present spheres 
is merely a matter of time. Internally, the forces mak- 
ing for rebellion on a grand scale are daily gaining 
strength, and, once they realize that no power exists to 
suppress them, will usurp in vast regions the office of 
government." 

It is noteworthy that the price President 
Krueger said he would make England pay for 
taking the Transvaal is growing larger with 
every day of British conquest in South Africa, 
Mr. Colquhoun himself admitting the loss of 
prestige the British name has suffered in the 
Far East through the war against the burghers. 
The paltry gold of the Witwatersrand, most of 
it owned on the Continent of Europe in any 
event, seems to have effectually decoyed Britain 
away from her real imperial interests, which 
are certain to suffer in China through the 
entente between Russia, France, and Germany. 
Just as the unorganized opposition of the Fili- 
pino "savages" keeps the American imperialist 
from being anything more than a politician at 
this time, with the certainty that the govern- 
ment is, like England's, powerless to protect 
its great commerce with China, so the imperial 
armies of the Empress of India are preoccupied 
with spreading civilization among the Dutch, 
when they might be enjoying the spoils of piracy 
with those nations which talk less about Chris- 
tianity and civilization and have a keener nose 
for loot. 

It is of the individual Chinaman, not of the 
nation, that the Reverend Doctor Arthur Smith 
treats in his " Village Life in China," and his 
panoramic volume shows how human the pig- 
tailed Celestial is, all testimony of those who 
do not know him so well to the contrary not- 
withstanding. Doctor Smith writes from an 
intimate knowledge, his work being both an 
expansion and a supplement to his earlier 
" Chinese Characteristics." He paints a suc- 
cession of pictures, showing a patient and long- 
suffering folk, whose struggle for mere exist- 
ence has taken from them many of the finer 
qualities of humanity to leave them the very 
exemplars of the earth for the ability to be 
content upon nothing. So overcrowded is the 
country, so honored from age to age the equiv- 
alent of the scriptural injunction to " increase 
and multiply," that no people can surpass the 
Chinese for patience, for industry, and for 
adaptability to hard conditions. Dr. Smith 
says : 

" Poverty in China is often a synonym for the most 



abject misery and want. The entire possessions of great 
numbers of the people would not amount in value to 
five dollars, and thousands of persons never know whence 
the next meal is to come. Such persons would in Eu- 
ropean countries constitute what are called the dan- 
gerous classes.' In China, unless their distress is extreme, 
they do not mass themselves, and they seldom wage 
war against society as a whole." 

" A few small birds, and the common hare, seem to 
constitute the objects most frequently shot, but except 
in the case of the limited number of those who make a 
business of securing such game to sell as a means of 
support, there are very few persons who devote their 
energies to any form of hunting. Indeed, the instinct 
which is said to lead the average Englishman to remark 
It is a fine day, let us go and kill something,' is totally 
lacking in the Chinese." 

" To the intelligent foreigner, the most prominent 
fact in China is the poverty of its people. There are 
too many villages to the square mile, too many families 
to the village, too many mouths to the family. Where- 
ever one goes, it is the same weary tale with intermina- 
ble reiteration. Poverty, poverty, poverty, always and 
evermore poverty. The empire is broad, its unoccupied 
regions are extensive, and its undeveloped resources 
undoubtedly vast. But in what way can these resources 
be so developed as to benefit the great mass of the 
Chinese people ? By none with which we are acquainted 
or of which we can conceive, without a radical disturb- 
ance of the existing conditions. The seething mass of 
over-population must be drawn off to the regions where 
it is needed, and then only will there be room for the 
relief of those who remain. . . . War, famine, pesti- 
lence sweep off millions of the population, but a few 
decades of peace seem to repair the ravages of the past, 
which are lost to sight, like battlefields covered with 
wide areas of waving grain." 

These are a few scattered excerpts from a 
book which should be read as a whole, one 
which it is hard to overpraise. It is apparent 
that the Chinese dislike foreigners, but the 
dislike seems to spring from the active inter- 
vention of the conservative literary class in 
concrete examples, rather than to be based 
upon anything more hostile than the dislike of 
all ignorant folk for strangers. It is to be 
learned that there are a million of native Ro- 
man Catholics distributed through twenty-five 
bishoprics in China, with fifty thousand pro- 
testants of all denominations, the Catholics 
being independent of European contributions 
either in men or money. Many other surprises 
are contained in one or another of these books, 
which are all in a degree complementary of and 
supplementary to one another. 

Yet, when all have been read and digested, 
there will be found something very baffling 
beneath all the information and speculation, 
bearing out to the full Doctor Smith's dictum, 
" It is seldom safe to generalize in regard to 

anything in China."

THEOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY.* 

Though the title of Mr. Howe's book on 
" The Puritan Republic of the Massachusetts 
Bay " suggests to the reader, and was prob- 
ably suggested by, Mr. Goodwin's " Pilgrim 
Republic," yet the comparison ends with the 
titles. Mr. Goodwin traced in a minute man- 
ner the development of what was indeed, from 
first to last, the "Pilgrim Republic." Mr. 
Howe could not exhibit a parallel process in 
Massachusetts Bay, for the process there was 
radically different from that in Plymouth. In- 
deed, he has not, in the contents of his book, 
illustrated his title. He has re-stated the de- 
tails, in succinct and agreeable form, of the 
establishment of the Puritan Theocracy in the 
Bay Colony. Of his eighteen chapters, the 
eleventh closes with his account of the " Fall 
of the Theocracy." In the succeeding chap- 
ters he traces the development, out of the the- 
ocratic system first established, of the principles 
and practice of local representative government ; 
and next the growth of the idea of federation, as 
exemplified in the association of the United 
Colonies of New England. It is made plain in 
his pages that the sturdy independence of the 
Massachusetts Bay colonists, which was so great 
a factor in the American Revolution, grew up 
on the ruins and after the fall of the theocracy. 
It was in spite of Puritanism, and in opposi- 
tion to its spirit and tendencies in government, 
that a popular representative system was devel- 
oped. The commonwealth utilized many of 
the liberal ideas which had distinguished the 
government of the Pilgrims ; but the influences 
thus contributed by the Pilgrim Republic to 
the commonwealth into which it was merged 
are not here given the prominence they deserve. 
The republic in the Bay Colony, though pro- 
moted by many persons of Puritan antecedents 
and sympathies, was not a Puritan movement ; 
and the title of Mr. Howe's book is misleading. 

This contribution to Massachusetts history 
is written in protest against the strictures of 
the Brooks Adams school concerning the theo- 
crats, and with a desire to treat them fairly, 
and to place honorably to their credit their 
sturdiness, energy, and honesty. Mr. Howe 
emulates the calmness and impartiality of Pal- 
frey, and seeks to recall criticism from the 
extreme views championed by our contempo- 
rary Adamses. He has not veiled the excesses

IN NEW ENGLAND. By Daniel Wait Howe. Indianapolis :

or absurdities of the theocratic government, 
nor sought to palliate or excuse them. His 
summary statement, in the compass of a few 
chapters, of the characteristics, habits, mode 
of life, aims and plans of government of the 
Puritans of the Bay Colony presents the whole 
subject, in its various aspects, in convenient 
and succinct form. It is an admirable con- 
densation of the historical matter to which so 
many compendious volumes have been devoted. 
Extenuating nothing, and setting down nothing 
in either malice or prejudice, Mr. Howe dem- 
onstrates that there were merits even in this 
system, which has become so far outgrown that 
no one now has any sympathy for it. The facts 
he has summarized, in his concluding chap- 
ters, tracing the " Genesis of a still greater Re- 
public," show clearly how the vigorous and 
trenchant democracy of Massachusetts became 
the prototype and the inspirer of a democratic 
spirit of continental operation, and illustrate 
the extent of our national indebtedness to the 
rejected theocracy. 

The position of the Theocrats respecting re- 
ligious toleration is here stated with a dignified 
calmness. They did not pretend that heresy 
should be tolerated, even in themselves. They 
maintained their own immunity from hostile ac- 
tion by the English government, " not because 
it had no right to punish men for advocating 
heretical views, but because their views were 
not heretical "; and they asserted the right to 
punish, as they did, those who held certain 
views, "because, as they believed, such views 
were heretical, and dangerous to church and 
state " (p. 256). So the Puritans are acquitted 
of the common accusation of insincerity. 
" Whatever else they were," says Mr. Howe, 
" they were not hypocrites. They did not de- 
vour widows' houses and for a pretense make 
long prayers " (p. 256). They possessed a 
share of the intense intolerance of their age, 
" and of whatever there was heroic in it, the 
Puritans presented the highest types " (p. 
258). So the author strives to retouch the 
gloomy portraits of the Puritan ministers 
which have been " painted by Oliver and 
Brooks Adams," and to remove the impression 
" evidently sought to be conveyed by Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams, that the Puritans 
themselves were hypocritical, or at least incon- 
sistent " (p. 255). 

But with all his generosity of feeling for 
the accused colonists of the Bay, Mr. Howe 
turns sharply against them when he comes 
to consider their politics. In two chapters he

THE DIAL,

traces chronologically the resistance of the 
Puritans of the Theocracy and of the statesmen 
of the Commonwealth to the attempted aggres- 
sions of the British Parliament, under the title 
of " The Struggle for Independence." This 
resistance, from as early as 1646 at least, down 
to 1776, Mr. Howe stigmatizes as aiming really 
at independence, while covered with a thin 
veneer of pretended allegiance to the crown. 
In his view, the constant assertions by the col- 
onists of such allegiance were as thoroughly 
devoid of sincerity as were their religious as- 
sertions in the view of the Adamses. To ex- 
ploit this view, that the Bay colonists were in 
fact struggling for independence for a hundred 
and thirty years, seems to be one object of Mr. 
Howe's book. "It is certain," he says, "that 
long before the end of the commonwealth " 
they entertained this idea. They admitted 
only " some shadowy sort of allegiance to En- 
gland," and they " did try to demonstrate how 
they could be independent and at the same 
time owe allegiance to England, but the ex- 
periment was a failure " (p. 319). After the 
accession of Charles II., their struggle is " seen 
more and more clearly " to be one for inde- 
pendence. The answers of the colonial gov- 
ernment in 1681 to the complaints of the king 
"were probably the best that could be de- 
vised," but Mr. Howe is not surprised that 
they " were far from being satisfactory " to the 
king. So he industriously convicts the colon- 
ists of a studied hypocrisy in politics, only 
equal in degree to that in religion of which 
Mr. Adams convicts them, but of which we 
have seen Mr. Howe acquit them. The fre- 
quent assertion of the Massachusetts leaders 
in the Revolution, that they, in common with 
all the other colonists, aimed in the beginning, 
not at independence, but only at the preserva- 
tion of their rights under the British constitu- 
tion, was indeed hypocrisy most offensive, if 
Mr. Howe's views are correct. 

It is plain that he has wholly failed to ap- 
prehend the position of the colonies, Massa- 
chusetts included, before the Declaration of 
Independence, as to their constitutional rela- 
tions to the crown of Great Britain. This 
appears from his assertion that the Bay colo- 
nists " by their acceptance of the charter had 
recognized the authority of England to levy 
and collect taxes, one of the highest attributes 
of sovereignty " (p. 355). The arguments of 
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as to the 
position of the colonists as separate parts of 
the British empire, and their several allegiance 



to the crown, which were based in part on the 
same historical precedents as those cited by the 
Bay colonists in 1646, would have no effect 
upon our author, for they were only " verbi- 
age " when used by these Puritans. In all 
this, he seems to have taken his cue from Mr. 
Brooks Adams, who, in his " Emancipation 
of Massachusetts," demurs to the legal views 
of Mr. John Adams, expressed in 1776, as 
to the "nullity of the acts of Parliament" 
against which he and his compatriots had so 
earnestly protested (p. 302), and who thinks 
the colonial clergy of 1646, in their statement 
of the colonial relations toward England, 
wished " to enjoy tHe privileges and safe- 
guards of British subjects without yielding 
obedience to British law " (p. 90). But even 
Mr. Brooks Adams, while he doubted the 
soundness of the legal views of his great an- 
cestor, did not go on to criticize him as a hyp- 
ocrite in pretending that independence was a 
second thought, but says, in the same thesis, 
that not only Washington but Jefferson and 
Adams were at first opposed to the idea of sep- 
aration from Great Britain (p. 347). 

The new historical theories of the modern 
Adamses are hardly a safe guide for historians. 
Mr. John Adams, in his arguments in support 
of the constitutional position so carefully as- 
sumed by the American colonies under his 
guidance, successfully refuted the Parliament- 
ary assumptions by precedents from British 
historical and juridical sources, proved by 
those precedents the right of each colony to 
have its internal affairs, including taxation, 
regulated by its own legislative assembly, and 
demonstrated the superior acquaintance of 
American lawyers with the British constitution. 
The pages of Mr. Howe's " Puritan Republic " 
abound with statements and arguments and 
protests made by the colonists of whom he 
writes, which evidence their ability, early and 
late, as constitutional statesmen. He might 
well have selected this feature of their history 
namely, their struggle for their constitutional 
rights as illustrated in the citations he has 
made from their deliverances, to be his special 
thesis. JAMES OSCAR PIERCE,

THE SCOPE or RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION.* 



The seventeen volumes in our present group of 
recent religious discussions are pretty evenly divided 
between discussions in which the historical or the 
theoretical or the practical element respectively pre- 
dominates. We shall notice them in this general 
order. There cannot readily be a more wholesome 
relation than that in which the theoretical is snugly 
laid away between the historical and the practical. 

" The Social Meaning of Modern Religious Move- 
ments in England" is an admirable book. The 
purpose is comprehensive and historic, and is pur- 
sued with liberality of feeling and with insight. 
The author conceives clearly the immense import- 
ance of the social and religious changes that have 
taken place in England in the present century and 
the last portion of the previous one. He also ap- 
prehends the great variety of conflicting causes that 
have promoted them. Free of dogmatism, he finds 
his way among these great events as an Alpine road 
threads ravines and passes right and left lofty sum- 
mits. The style is sometimes negligent, but this is 
of minor moment. 

" A Critical History of the Evolution of Trinita- 
rianism" will interest all to whom the subject seems 
inviting. It is a scholarly and critical tracing of 
the changes which that central dogma of orthodox 
theology, the Trinity, has undergone; and of the pas-

sage of belief into what is known as the New Theol- 
ogy. A remarkable chapter in religious speculation 
is discussed with ability and in a liberal spirit. 

The Rev. Leighton Pullan has given us a minute 
historical sketch of the growth of the Book of Com- 
mon Prayer, and of its relation to other similar 
compilations. The work is made up of a series of 
relatively trifling facts with no commanding views ; 
and an intense interest in the subject itself is re- 
quired to make it readable. 

"The State and the Church" is historical and 
critical. It is popular in form, and is exceedingly 
discursive. It lacks that systematic, thorough, and 
independent line of thought which would make it 
valuable to the scholar. The book is strongly 
American in its temper. 

" Faith and Sight " is a clear, able, and candid 
production. Its main purpose is to give agnosti- 
cism standing in the religious court, and to put it 
on terms of giving and receiving with definite forms 
of faith. The chief criticism we are disposed to 
pass upon it is, that the author, in common with so 
many, seems inclined to separate science and faith 
widely from each other, assigning the one a force 
more absolute, and the other a form less verifiable, 
than belong to them respectively. Knowledge is 
one, from side to side. The same elements enter 
into it everywhere. What we know, we know under 
the same general conditions and by virtue of the 
same powers. We might as well think of the at- 
mosphere as without moisture, and of the ocean as 
without air, as to think of science as without the 
fallibility of human conceptions, or of religion as 
without the basis of valid experiences. 

The essays that make up the volume called 
"Ethics and Religion" were written early in the 
opening of the Ethical Movement, and " then gave 
character and direction " to it. They are the pro- 
duction of leaders in that movement, and are of 
deep interest. There is no spirit current among 
men more pure, discriminating, and gentle than 
the distinctively ethical spirit ; and none with which 
our social and religious life can be more advan- 
tageously infused. These essays are fitted to test 
and to stimulate the spiritual tone of every thought- 
ful man. 

The volume entitled "Theism in the Light of 
Present Science and Philosophy " is a series of lect- 
ures given as the first course on the foundation of 
the Charles F. Deems Lectureship. As the title 
implies, the lectures are primarily philosophical. 
They do not seem to us to be as interesting or as 
profitable as the extended knowledge and marked 
resources of the author should have made them. 
While a general line of thought is indicated in 
them, they unfold too much as an endless series of 
observations. We are not held close to a well de- 
fined purpose. It is hard to tell where we are, or 
whither we are going. Decision in announcing 
one's object, and tenacity in pursuing it, are espe- 
cially needful in a region of thought which suffers 
so much from a vague and changeable outlook.

Dr. Coe's work on " The Spiritual Life " calls for 
a favorable notice. It is a wise and patient effort 
to inquire into the physical conditions, especially 
those of temperament, which affect our spiritual 
life and oftentimes give color to it. While assign- 
ing due importance to these facts, the author does 
not use them as a means of subverting the spiritual 
phenomena under consideration. We shall be better 
able to handle our own lives and the lives of others 
by virtue of this discussion. 

" Back to Christ " is a book which springs from 
a strong sense of the confusion and failure that 
have accompanied theological speculations. The 
tone and purpose elicit our sympathy ; but the au- 
thor pushes his remedy too far. We are not to be 
led back to Christ simply as an authority. A better 
phrase is " Forward with Christ." Each man must 
be an authority to himself, no matter by whom he 
is led and taught. The autocracy of the spirit is 
the leading fact of the spirit, and the pivotal point 
on which debate is revolving. Christ leads us into 
truth. 

The books of Dr. Washington Gladden belong to 
a class one is glad to recommend. They are liberal, 
practical, and stimulating. The style is agreeable 
and the matter is instructive. Dr. Gladden is a 
favorable example of the efficiency of the new the- 
ology in every good word and work. The present 
volume, " How Much is Left of the Old Doctrines ? " 
is a detached discussion of a variety of current re- 
ligious themes, such as " What is the Supernatural ? " 
What is the Bible? " " Is there a Personal Devil? " 
It is characterized by sound sense. 

" The Personality of Truth " is brief and bright, 
and sound in its main contention. The assertion of 
the personality of man as the indissoluble unit in 
all analytic processes, is the impregnable citadel of 
spiritual truth. However the battle may go here 
and there in the open field, man has only to retire 
into himself and be safe. Truths, like words, lie 
between persons. Truth involves the giving and 
receiving mind, as much as does the tennis ball the 
two rackets. 

Bishop Huntington's volume on " Personal Reli- 
gious Life in the Ministry " is made up of six dis- 
courses on such themes as " Singleness of Heart," 
" Self -Sacrifice," " Thorough Service." In reading 
it, we are rid for the moment of all controversy. 
We are taken into the confidence of a single and 
pure heart, holding tenaciously by its own renovat- 
ing divine service. 

" The Conception of Immortality," by Dr. Josiah 
Royce, is a discussion of much ingenuity, of decisive 
literary merit, and, due allowance being made for 
the remoteness of the thought, one clearly rendered. 
It is a good running-mate with the discourse on the 
some theme recently given on the same foundation 
by Professor James. That discussion suggested a 
possible reconciliation of immortality with physical 
forces : this discussion considers its possible har- 
mony with the relations of the spiritual world under 
an idealistic philosophy. One already well-grounded 



in the belief in immortality, and with a relish for 
astute thought, might read both works without any 
serious loss of faith. The doctrine of immortality, 
like an ocean current, is far-reaching though not 
conspicuous in its forces. The practical mariner 
will be profoundly aware of it ; the mere voyager 
may pass into it and out of it with little observation, 
and find difficulty in determining its whereabouts. 

" Man and his Divine Father " is a very discur- 
sive treatise. The subject is comprehensive, and it 
loses nothing in vagueness by the treatment. The 
volume ranges from a consideration of the nature 
of man and of God to the philosophy of Philo, the 
state of Syria, and the Apocalypse. The work evinces 
profound self-confidence, and is marked by rash and 
unguarded assertions. The author seems to think 
that if he but walks across the world, a conspicuous 
path will be left behind him which all men will do 
well to follow. The true things that are said are 
thus lost in the general confusion and irrelevancy of 
the method. 

" An Essay toward Faith " is a book of devotion 
fitted to deepen our thoughts of life without render- 
ing them morbid. It combines, with more success 
than is usual, the comprehensiveness of human 
feeling with its spiritual quality. 

The last two volumes on our list, while wholly 
unlike in contents, fall together in one respect. In 
both, Biblical thoughts and Biblical events are used 
in so rigid and narrow a way as largely to separate 
spiritual life from the normal history of the world, 
and to put it under a comparatively barren disci- 
pline of its own. " Christ Came Again " is a pains- 
taking book. It presents very fully the words of 
Christ, and the anticipation of his disciples in con- 
nection with his second coming. This expectation 
was deep-seated and general. The author is by no 
means as successful in showing that the destruction 
of Jerusalem, or any events in connection with it, 
were the fulfilment of this anticipation. As a 
matter of fact, they were not so regarded. The 
conviction lived on in spite of them, and has 
wrought mischief to our own time. Aside from a 
theoretical necessity of meeting the prophetic lan- 
guage with some corresponding event, few if any 
would have thought of the destruction of Jerusalem 
as standing for the coming of Christ. The author 
struggles with the fact that the minds of men have 
not seen or accepted the agreement between the 
expectation and its fulfilment. This lack of corre- 
spondence remains a serious obstacle to the theory 
of the absolute and accurate inspiration of the New 
Testament. No ingenuity can evade the fact that 
the feelings called out and the events that followed 
after them have not corresponded with each other. 

" The Crown of Christ " is a series of Scripture 
readings, and of reflections meant to accompany 
the sacred seasons of the Church in the circuit of 
its Liturgical Year. They are well of their kind, 
but, alas, what a kind ! One is strongly and pain- 
fully impressed in this volume, and in the preceding 
one, with the immense burden of dogma and lit-

urgy which oppresses the Christian Church. Many 
nuts germinate slowly, or not at all, because of the 
thickness of the shell. Spiritual life is enveloped 
by a tenacious religiosity which separates it from 
the vitalizing power of the present. We have a 
liturgical year, and not God's year of fresh experi- 
ences a world on the march. Many, like a timid 
woodsman, are trying to find their way by studying 
half-effaced, conflicting, and overgrown marks 
blazed on the trees ; they fail to comprehend the 
cardinal points of the compass, the lay of the land, 
and the world that envelopes them. When will 
men believe that God's immediate word is as good 
as any word he has ever spoken, and, more than 
any, pertinent to our wants ! These two books dis- 
close the ease with which believers make a religion, 
infinitely more narrow than our present living faith, 
out of the mere shreds and waste experiences of 
previous generations. J OHN BASCOM. 



BKIBFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Professor Crawshaw, in his " Liter- 
7 Interpretation of Life" (Mac- 
millan), shows that literature, as a 
natural outgrowth of life, also reveals life. This 
revelation concerns the personality of the author, 
the age in which he lives, his race, and his nation- 
ality in distinction from his race. It is also the 
reflector of the broad traits of humanity. The influ- 
ence of Taine is tolerably evident in the division of 
the subject-matter, and it must be said, as the au- 
thor anticipates in his prefatory note, that in the 
outlines of his course there is much that is reminis- 
cent of the beaten track. Yet there are numerous 
passages of vivid suggestion, as, " When most sin- 
cere [literature] is less a desire to be heard than a 
desire to speak "; and, " If the absolute truth of life 
could ever be presented, then any particular phase 
might be treated once and for all. It is because 
we can at best have only approximations to the 
truth that all artistic representations of life, even 
though they should cover essentially the same 
ground, have importance and value." The author 
uses as tools, to dig out the details of his amplifi- 
cation, a few favorite topics. He recommends, 
again and again, the chronological order of literary 
study, based on individual works and the complete 
works of individual writers. This completeness is 
to be extended to epochs, and to the synchronous 
production of several races, suggesting the need of 
more than one lifetime for the student. Contem- 
porary history is to be carefully studied as well, in 
order to reach the full revelation of literature, which 
includes both the external aspects of man, like his 
manners, and also his inward life or character. 
The revelation may be direct or indirect, conscious 
or unconscious, " objective or subjective," the last 
set of terms being somewhat out of favor, one may 
remark, since Carlyle's satirical description of Cole- 



ridge's monologue, in which these Kantian terms 
were mumbled. Browning, whose name appears 
again and again, is accepted as " the sufficient rep- 
resentation of that power of genius which has filled 
the world's literature with immortal creations of 
men and women who are at once living individuals 
and impressive types of the qualities and charac- 
teristics of humanity." Yet the author's view in- 
cludes reference to names covering the whole field 
of English literature, and he makes illuminating 
mention of one or two American writers. Some of 
his quotations, like those from Matthew Arnold, 
show how very possible it is for good people to 
differ as to the value of poetical passages. A num- 
ber of topics are touched in a manner to open dis- 
cussion and stimulate thought. Indeed, the chief 
originality of the book, it would seem, lies in these 
incidental remarks. It is here that the author him- 
self appears. He is a stanch defender of literature 
as one of the arts, holding it to be the most natural 
and adequate means of human expression, perfect 
and universal. And his book will serve both the 
general reader and the teacher of literature by 
showing in how many different ways the study of 
literature may be profitably pursued. 

Christian To those who know Dr. Thomas 

philosophy and Chalmers simply as a great preacher, 
civic needs. an( j ag the i ea( j er of that dramatic 

secession from the Established Church which be- 
came the Free Church of Scotland, his volume on 
"The Christian and Civic Economy of Large 
Towns " (Scribner) will be something of a surprise, 
revealing him as a vigorous writer on some of the 
most important economic and sociological questions 
of the present day, such as wages, trades-unions, 
pauperism, savings-banks, mechanic schools, etc. 
His treatment of these subjects is always from a 
practical and Christian standpoint, with the earnest 
intention of improving the condition of the working 
classes. He is not an original authority in economic 
theory ; but he is an independent thinker and a 
powerful writer. His theories go hand in hand 
with earnest practical work in the slums of Edin- 
burgh ; and in the book can be felt the heart-throbs 
of a man who is in personal contact with the men 
and women to whose sufferings and struggles he is 
attempting to apply the relief of Christian philos- 
ophy. The social settlement and institutional 
church of our day find their antetype in Dr. Chal- 
mers's later work, which called forth the admira- 
tion of Carlyle : " What a wonderful old man 
Chalmers is ! When so many of us are wringing 
our hands in hopeless despair over the vileness and 
wretchedness of the large towns, there goes the old 
man, shovel in hand, down into the dirtiest puddles 
of the West Port of Edinburgh, cleans them out, 
and fills the sewers with living waters. It is a 
beautiful sight." The work of Dr. C. R. Hender- 
son, in abridging Dr. Chalmers's treatise, is admir- 
ably done. In a volume of 350 pages, he has 
condensed the three bulky volumes of the original 



1900.]

text, reproducing its exact words, but omitting repe- 
titions and matters of local or temporary interest. 
Connecting the portions of the original work thus 
transcribed, are " bracketed additions designed to 
indicate the transitional thoughts or to explain some 
point which might otherwise be left in obscurity." 
Dr. Henderson has also prefixed a valuable Intro- 
duction, in which Dr. Chalmers's doctrines are 
carefully examined and his contributions to mod- 
ern thought considered. 

Hotel de Not infrequently the mention of the 

Rambouillet Hotel de Rambouillet calls at once 

and the Precieuses. to the min( j of the gene ral reader of 

French literature scenes in Les Precieuses Ridi- 
cules, and he thinks of the first French salon only 
as the hot-bed of absurd affectations of speech, 
dress, and manners, which were epidemic in the 
seventeenth century. The world has joined so 
heartily with Moliere in the laugh at the expense 
of these faddists, who were only imitators of imi- 
tators, that it has often failed to appreciate the 
originators, the coterie which the Marquise de Ram- 
bouillet gathered about her for twoscore years. 
The influence of this brilliant marquise was excep- 
tional, even in France, where women as society 
leaders have done so much. A misjudgment of the 
Hotel de Rambouillet means a misunderstanding of 
some of the most important and characteristic fea- 
tures of France of the seventeenth century, in- 
deed, of France of all times; for what is more 
peculiarly French than its social genius? It is 
worth while for us Anglo-Saxons, who many times 
are keen for the vices and blind to the virtues of 
the French, to get a true conception of this salon, 
which, if it did contain the genius of affectation, 
threw its weight so unmistakably on the side of 
purity and refinement. It is interesting also to 
study the achievement of a woman who saw better 
things for her associates than formality and attend- 
ance on lectures and classes. A small library has 
already been written on the subject ; and the dif- 
ficult task which Mr. Leon H. Vincent has per- 
formed in "Hotel de Rambouillet and the Pre*- 
cieuses " (Houghton) is to condense the chief facts 
within about a hundred pages. He promises only 
a resume, but the bare bones show through but sel- 
dom. He has given an interesting as well as help- 
ful and suggestive narrative, which entices the 
reader into the wider fields opened by a valuable 
bibliography of the subject, appended to the book. 

Persistent features ^ n l" 8 brief sketch of " France Since 
of the French 1814" (Macmillan), Baron Pierre 

constitutional life. de Coubertin has 8ought to bring 

clearly into view those elements in the political 
structure of France, which, though profoundly 
shaken by the revolutions of 1830, 1848, and 1870, 
have nevertheless been preserved or restored. He 
thinks that the persistence of these features of 
French constitutional life has been obscured by the 
division of the whole period into sections, such as 



the " Restoration," the " Monarchy of July," the 
" Republic of '48," etc., in this way emphasizing 
the phenomena of crises. To Louis XVIII. he 
gives the chief credit for whatever has been accom- 
plished toward establishing a sound constitutional 
system. And it was the prosperity which the re- 
stored monarchy created that enabled Napoleon 
III., in the early days of the Empire, to make 
France the arbiter of Europe. Moreover, so soon 
as the spectre of the June days ceased to terrify 
the Bourgeoisie, the desire for a return to the con- 
stitutional system of the monarchy was difficult to 
resist, and the Empire became " liberal." The 
Third Republic, too, is in its governmental forms 
hardly more than a revival of the same constitu- 
tional system. This is Baron de Coubertin's thesis, 
which gradually becomes clearer as one moves 
through his running commentary on Nineteenth 
Century France. The second half of the book is 
stronger than the first, which abounds in strange, 
not to say untenable, views of the period from 1814 
to 1848. As has already been intimated, Baron 
de Coubertin has a high opinion of the statesman- 
ship of Louis XVIII. and of " his intense moral 
energy." He has an equally unmeasured contempt 
for Thiers, who, he thinks, was the principal mis- 
chief-maker in July, 1830. The Ordinances, he 
says, hardly constituted a coup d'etat, adding that 
it was only the absence of preparation for resist- 
ance that finally provoked the rioting. But the 
most extraordinary assertion in the book explains 
that "the recognition of those Spanish colonies 
which were already constituted separate States, to- 
gether with their commercial liberty," was " secured 
by our [sic] initiative." One or two curious verbal 
blunders have crept into the text : " orthodoxes," 
referring to Greek Christians, and the " Chamber 
of Communes " for the House of Commons. 



Croquet, 
properly 
so called. 



To those who in these days of golf 
are scornful of the game which we 
have heard called "Presbyterian 
billiards " we commend Mr. Arthur Lillie's " Cro- 
quet up to Date " (Longmans). From that instruc- 
tive treatise many things may be learned, and, as 
not the least among them, respect for a game far 
superior to either tennis or golf in the opportunities 
which it offers for strategy and finesse, and, indeed, 
for most other forms of skill which demand some- 
thing more than brute strength. The term " cro- 
quet," as here used, is of course something very 
different from that childish parody of the sport 
often practised upon American lawns, in which two 
shots are claimed for scoring two points at once, and 
in which the player puts his foot upon his own ball 
to keep it from following the ball that he is engaged 
in croquetting. These strange vagaries, and others 
equally weird, are, we believe, still prevalent in this 
country, and are even countenanced by the " rules " 
which the manufacturers of " croquet sets " provide 
for innocent purchasers. That they disappeared 
from the real game decades ago is a fact which all

players know, of course, but which it seems about 
as difficult to enforce upon old-fashioned persons as 
it is difficult to enforce the principles of modern 
whist upon persons who deem the last word to have 
been said by the earlier Hoyle. Mr. Lillie's book 
is full of interesting matter openings, systems of 
tactics, accounts of famous players, and suggestions 
for revised rules. We recommend it to all devotees 
of the unduly neglected game of skill with which it 
deals, and particularly to such others as, knowing 
nothing of the sport, have minds that are open to 
conviction upon the subject.

pared by Dr. H. D. M. Spence, Dean 
of Gloucester, under the title of " The White Robe 
of Churches" (Scribner's importation). Living in 
Gloucester deanery, and in the very shadow of the 
grand Cathedral, various questions have from time 
to time naturally suggested themselves to Dr. 
Spence, such as, " At what special epoch, and under 
what special circumstances, were these inimitable 
mighty prayer-homes built? and what special inspi- 
ration fired the builders' hearts? Was there any 
ancient type after which these grand piles were de- 
signed and finished? Who were the builders? 
What of the vanished dwellers in these abbeys and 
cloisters? have they any special story?" It was 
in framing replies to these and kindred queries that 
Dr. Spence's little book grew up. It is popular and 
entertaining, rather than drily technical, and writ- 
ten in a vein of pious enthusiasm that warms the 
style and fixes the attention of the reader. We 
know of no book of its scope in which the history 
and the main structural features of these grand and 
inspiring mediaeval edifices are more intelligently 
and attractively set forth for the general reader 
than this temptingly made and beautifully illus- 
trated one by Dean Spence. There are sixty-eight 
plates, full-page and vignette, from photographs, 
drawings, and standard books on architecture. 

Urbanity, a light satiric touch, and 
seasonableness of theme, mark the 
essays by Mr. Eliot Gregory which 
are grouped in a neat volume under the title " The 
Ways of Men" (Scribner). There are thirty-three 
papers in all, under such tempting captions as 
" Domestic Despots," " Machine - Made Men," 
"Some American Husbands," "The Grand Opera 
Fad," " The Genealogical Craze," " Pre-palatial 
Newport," " The Dinner and the Drama," etc. 
Other papers, wherein the satirist of current follies 
and fleeting social affectations is less apparent, are : 
"Cyrano, Rostand, Coquelin " (substantially M. 
Coquelin's own account, as given to Mr. Gregory, 
of his earlier acquaintance with M. Rostand and 
first production of " Cyrano ") ; " Calve' at Cabri- 
eres," " Carolus " (Carolus-Duran), "Sardou at 
Marly-le-Roy," etc. As a satirist of manners, Mr. 
Gregory knows how to be both sensible and amus- 



ing ; and his gentle ridicule of passing folly is of 
the stingless kind that cures. Let us add that Mr. 
Gregory will be better known to many under his 
pen-name, " An Idler." He has " idled " to good 
purpose. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Dr. Ernest F. Henderson's " Side Lights on English 
History," published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is a 
royal octavo volume of extracts from letters, papers, 
and diaries of the past three centuries. It places in the 
hands of students a great amount of original material, 
and is one of the most comprehensive and satisfactory 
of the many source-books that have been published 
during recent years. Even more interesting than the 
text is the series of sumptuous illustrations, eighty in 
number, with which it is provided. These are for the 
most part full-page portraits from contemporary paint- 
ings and engravings, and constitute such a series as 
cannot be found in any other similar work. 

Mr. Henry W. Elson has just published, through the 
Messrs. Macmillan, a second volume of his readable and 
entertaining " Side Lights on American History." The 
period covered is that from 1860 to the present time. 
The author gets on delicate ground when he discusses 
the recent war, and there is too much of the " poor old 
Spain " idea about his writing to win the approval of 
sober readers. But teachers, and others, will welcome 
this book as a whole, because of its intelligent account 
of such things as the Alabama Claims, the impeachment 
of Johnson, and the Electoral Commission of 1876 
things about which it is not always easy to get definite 
and compact information. 

Mr. Robert Waters is the author, and the Edgar S. 
Werner Co. are the publishers, of a volume entitled 
" Flashes of Wit and Humor." It is a pleasant little 
book, full of anecdotes and witticisms of all degrees of 
antiquity, collected into a series of chapters, to each of 
which the author gives a sort of unity by means of his 
own appreciative and genial commentary. He has a 
quick sense for the humorous phrase or situation, and a 
wholesome instinct for the rejection of anything that 
approaches coarseness or vulgarity. We are glad to 
say a word in commendation of this latest of " Joe 
Millers." 

" North America " is the subject of the second book 
in the series of geographies prepared for the Macmillan 
Co. by Professors Ralph S. Tarr and Frank M. Mc- 
Murry. These books certainly solve the problem of 
reducing a school geography to the dimensions of an 
ordinary book, which alone should prove a potent rec- 
ommendation. They are in other respects thoroughly 
praiseworthy, being modern in scholarship and treat- 
ment, provided with all sorts of helpful suggestions for 
the work of teaching, as well as with illustrations in 
unusual number and variety. 

A handsomely-printed catalogue of the exhibit of the 
Oxford University Press at the Paris Exposition is 
issued by Mr. Henry Frowde. The catalogue is in 
three parts, devoted respectively to the Educational, 
Binding, and Paper exhibits. The illustrations of 
unique special bindings executed at the Oxford Press, 
and the description of the wonderful Oxford India paper, 
are the most noteworthy features of this altogether 
interesting catalogue.

NOTES. 



Mr. G. Bernard Shaw's " An Unsocial Socialist " has 
just been published in a satisfactory new edition by the 
Messrs. Brentano. 

" Robert's Primer of Parliamentary Law," by Mr. 
Joseph Thomas Robert, is a recent publication of the 
Doubleday & McClure Co. 

Messrs. Sibley & Ducker publish a " Practical Com- 
position and Rhetoric," the work of Messrs. William 
E. Mead and Wilbur F. Gordy. 

Dr. Charles G. Herbermann has edited the " Bellum 
Catilinse " of Sallust for schools, and the book is pub- 
lished by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. 

Volume XI. of the " Larger Temple Shakespeare " 
(Dent-Macmilhui) has just been published, leaving but 
one more volume to complete the edition. 

" A Term of Ovid," by Mr. Clarence W. Gleason, is 
a text which provides " ten stories from the ' Meta- 
morphoses ' for girls and boys." It is published by the 
American Book Co. 

" The Red Badge of Courage," by Stephen Crane, is 
republished by the Messrs. Appleton, this time accom- 
panied by a portrait, as well as by a biographical sketch 
which Mr. Ripley Hitchcock signs. 

A new volume in the attractive little " Nugget Series," 
published by Messrs. Fords, Howard & Hulbert, is a 
compilation of " Quaint Nuggets," made up of selec- 
tions from various Elizabethan writers. 

" Tom Jones," in two volumes, edited by Mr. A. W. 
Pollard, is the latest addition to the " Library of En- 
glish Classics " published by the Messrs. Macmillan. 
Mr. A. W. Pollard has edited the text, as in the case 
of the rest of the series. 

" Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, Illustrated by Dreams of 
Metaphysics " (Macmillan) is a translation from Kant, 
supplemented by correlative passages from Swedenborg. 
Mr. E. F. Goerwitz is the translator, and Mr. Frank 
Sewall the editor of this volume. 

" Some Problems of Lotze's Theory of Knowledge," 
discussed by Edwin Proctor Robins, is the first volume 
in the series of " Cornell Studies in Philosophy," pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. The author of this mon- 
ograph was a promising scholar who died about a year 
ago at the age of twenty-six. 

The following numbers have just been added to the 
Columbia series of studies in political science : " Colo- 
nial Immigration Laws," by Mr. E. E. Proper; "His- 
tory of Military Pension Legislation in the United

Theory of Sovereignty since Rousseau," by Dr. C. E. 
Merriam. 

The latest expression of the energy and good taste 
of the English firm of Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. is the 
series of " Illustrated English Poems." Shelley's " The 
Sensitive Plant " and Cowper's " John Gilpin " are the 
two widely different texts chosen to inaugurate the 
series. In his spirited drawings for "John Gilpin," 
Mr. Brock proves himself the legitimate successor to 
Randolph Caldecott. Mr. Housman's work is strongly 
suggestive of Pre-Raphaelite influences, and the mystic 
quality of his drawings is well adapted to Shelley's lines. 

" A High School Grammar," by Dr. Brainard Kel- 
logg and the late Alonzo Reed, with much helpful col- 
laboration from Professor F. A. March, is a recent 
publication of Messrs. Maynard, Merrill & Co. It 



includes a good deal of historical and comparative 
grammar, with references to Latin, Old English, and 
the modern languages, which, of course, place it be- 
yond the reach of elementary school children, and jus- 
tifies its title. It seems an excellent book for its purpose. 

A new monthly magazine is about to make its appear- 
ance in London under the title of " The New Liberal 
Review." It will resemble most of the well-known 
English reviews in form and size, and will include arti- 
cles on literary and general interest. In spite of its 
popular attractions, however, its principal aim is to be 
the monthly organ of liberal imperialism, with particu- 
lar attraction for the younger writers of the Liberal 
cause. The joint editors of the new venture will be 
Messrs. Cecil and Hildebrand Harmsworth. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " Specimens of the 
Forms of Discourse," a text for schools edited by Dr. 
E. H. Lewis. Criticism is illustrated, as well as the 
four primary types of discourse, and there is a useful 
list of suggested exercises at the end of the volume. 
The same publishers send us an edition of Tennyson's 
" Princess," prepared by Professor L. A. Sherman, and 
illustrating his peculiar methods of annotation and 
instruction. There is a sixty-page introduction upon 
poetic diction in general, full of solemn vagaries, and 
illustrated with remarkable diagrams. It is lucky that 
the approach to literature is not often hedged about 
with such forbidding defences. 

The organization is announced, in New York City, of 
the American Publishers' Association, with Mr. Charles 
Scribner as President, Gen. A. C. McClurg and Mr. 
George Mifflin as Vice-Presidents, Mr. George P. Brett 
(of The Macmillan Co.) as Secretary, and Mr. G. B. M. 
Harvey (of Harper & Brothers) as Treasurer. The 
promotion of the interests of publishers, authors, book- 
sellers, book manufacturers, and bookbuyers is stated 
to be the general purpose of the association; while, 
more specifically, an attempt will be made to secure 
greater uniformity of prices to the public and to pre- 
vent the " cutting " system which has proved so detri- 
mental and demoralizing to the regular book trade. 

Readers of the American Economic Association's col- 
lection of critical monographs on " The Federal Census," 
reviewed in THE DIAL a few months ago, will be inter- 
ested in a paper by Professor Walter F. Willcox, one

of the Division of Methods and Results, and a contrib- 
utor to the former discussion, entitled " Plans for the

The following information about Professor Barrett 
Wendell's forthcoming " Literary History of America," 
from the London " Athenseum," is of interest: "The 
author endeavours to define the points in which the 
nation, character, and thought of America have di-

With 80 full-page illustrations. 300 pp. 8vo. **$5.00. 

Accounts and pictures by contemporaries ingeniously arranged to give the effect of a continuous history, and dealing with 
such topics as the personality of Queen Elizabeth, the execution of Mary Stuart, characteristic traits of Cromwell, the return 
of Charles II., the Stuarts in exile, Queen Anne and the Marlboroughs, etc., etc.; illustrated by 80 portraits, fac-siniiles, 
caricatures, etc., reproduced directly from the rarest original mezzotint and line engravings. 

A T . Y. Tribune : "It is not unlikely that he who has dipped into this book in the early afternoon will find himself still reading when night 
cornea. ... A better book to put in the hands of the lover of history, whether he be a beginner or an old student, we do 
not know." 

Dial: " One of the most comprehensive and satisfactory of the many source-books that have been published during recent years. Even 
more interesting than the text is the series of sumptuous illustrations, eighty in number. . . . Such a series cannot be found 
in any other similar work." 

A'ation: "Particularly handsome in respect to printing, binding, and illustrations. The thirty-two subjects chosen are all important ones, 
and Dr. Henderson has used good authorities. . . . Much valuable material is put within reach."

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 

ii. 

It is now about twenty years, says Mr. C. K. 
Elout, writing of the literary history of the 
past twelvemonth in Holland, since " De 
Nieuwe Gids " started a new intellectual and 
artistic movement. 

" The movement swept over the country like a huge 
wave, and caused an immense disturbance, for the bold 
behaviour of the young authors, their courageous criti- 
cism of their predecessors, and especially their coinage 
of new and strange expressions, roused a storm of anger 



and indignation. But at the same time a band of ad- 
mirers gathered around them with an enthusiasm equal 
to the indignation displayed on the other side. And for 
many years the battle went on fiercely. It looked as 
if both parties were determined to fight ' to the bitter 
end,' but at length the opposition to the ' new literature ' 
was abandoned slowly and sullenly. The older gen- 
eration gave way. It continued writing in its own old- 
fashioned style though modified to a great extent by 
contact with its adversaries but it stopped criticizing." 

Of the writers who were identified with the 
new movement Messrs. Verwey, van Deyssel, 
van Eeden, Gorier, and Kloos only one, the 
first named, has published anything during the 
past year. The writer last named, however, 
has made a " literary " marriage which has at- 
tracted as much attention as a new book from 
his pen would have done. His bride is Miss 
Jeanne Reyneke van Stuwe, whose first book, 
" Hartstocht " (Passion), " is a short novel in 
which the author describes the life of one whom 
she thinks to be a man of passion, but who is 
really nothing of the kind, merely a base and 
reckless rake." The same young woman " has 
also issued a collection of poems in praise of 
Mr. Kloos, which an outsider I mean one 
who is neither Mr. Kloos nor Miss Reyneke 
cannot help finding rather monotonous.'* 
The chief novels of the year are " Als Kaf 
voor den Wind " (As Chaff before the Wind), 
by a pseudonymous lady ; "Geloof " (Faith), 
by Miss de Savornin Lohman ; " Kameleon," 
by Mr. V. Loosjes ; and " Verborgen Bronnen " 
(Hidden Springs), by Miss Augusta de Wit. 
Mr. Couperus has turned to fairy-tales. His 
" Fidessa," " is both interesting in its story 
and beautiful in the exquisite poetry of its 
language." The leading play of the year is 
Het Zevende Gebod " (The Seventh Com- 
mandment), by Mr. Heyermans. This " tragi- 
comedy of love without marriage in a flat in 
the Quartier Latin of Amsterdam " has proved 
immensely successful as a stage production. 

Mr. Leopold Katscher, writing from Hun- 
gary, begins his article with mention of some 
works of serious scholarship. Among them 
are the " History of Greece " of the late Pro- 
fessor Schvarcz ; a " History of the Greeks," 
by Professor G. Gyomlai; "The Life and 
Poetry of Imre Madach," by Mr. M. Palagyi ;, 
"Hungarian Music in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury," by Mr. Kernel Abranyi ; " The King- 
dom of Hungary," by Mr. A. V. Matlekovits ; 



90 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



" Studies in Social Politics," by Mr. Mano 
Somogyi ; " The Solution of the Peace Prob- 
lem," by Mr. Ferencz Kemeny; and "Wo- 
man's Work," by Mr. Andor Maday. In 
poetry, mention is made of Mr. Sandor Feleki's 
" Wandering Clouds," " a collection of nearly 
a hundred pieces of genuine poetry of a dreamy 
sort, without a trace of artificiality." In the 
drama, there are " Mother Earth," by Mr. 
Istvan Geczy ; " Prince Unique," a fairy piece 
by Mr. Elek Benedek ; " Learned Professor 
Hatvani," a comedy in verse by Mr. Emil 
Makai ; and u Shakespeare," by Mr. Arpad 
Zigany. In fiction, mention is made of 
" Among Strangers," by Mr. Ferencz Herczeg ; 
" Blue-Eyed Mrs. Davidka," by Mr. G. Gar- 
donyi ; " The Last," by Mr. Dezso Malonyay ; 
and the " Dying Gladiator," by Mr. Arpad 
Abonyi. Mr. Jokai's new book is the most 
important of all this fiction, and is character- 
ized as "a highly fantastic romance, which 
created the more stir as the writer gave up his 
widower's state last year in his seventy-fifth 
year to marry a young lady of twenty, and the 
book is highly personal, though not autobio- 
graphical. Love and old age are the subjects 
round which the master's extraordinary imagi- 
nation revolves. He squanders a whole mine 
of sarcasm, humor, self-mockery, bitter truth, 
and romantic extravagance. This strange pro- 
duction reads like a fascinating mixture of 
Boccaccio, Jules Verne, and E. T. A. Hoff- 
mann." " Aged but not Old " is the appro- 
priate title of this characteristic work. 

In Italy, writes Sig. Guido Biagi, the greatest 
literary successes of the year have been two 
foreign productions the " Quo Vadis " of 
Mr. Sienkiewicz, and the " Cyrano " of M. 
Rostand. The former, published in an author- 
ized translation by Sig. F. Verdinois, has, owing 
to a defect in the copyright laws, been also 
translated by several other hands, and thus 
pirated right and left. Its vogue, both as a 
book and as a drama, has been something ex- 
traordinary, and has even led to the prepara- 
tion of illustrated postcards, beyond which 
popularity can no farther go. The past year, 
" which in the history of the Catholic world will be 
called the Anno Santo or year of jubilee might in a 
literary sense, as far as Italy is concerned, be called the 
Dantesque year, since in it coincide centenaries of 
Dante's vision, and also of the year of his priorate 
(1300). . . . The cult of the hero as poet has taken at 
the present day a form which would have pleased even 
Carlyle, since he is celebrated by the younger men, and 
becoming more and more popular." 

The Florentines have now a Dante lectureship 



in full swing, and the poet is periodically ex- 
pounded in Orsanmichele. 

" Lectures 011 Dante and readings from his works have 
been given everywhere this year, and the finest cantos 
of the ' Commedia ' have even been recited on the stage. 
In fact, the poet has been all the rage, and the natural 
eloquence, not to say verbosity, of the Italians must 
have found utterance to the full in this enthusiasm." 

The serious works upon Dante include " Dante 
and Heresy," by Sig. Felice Tocco ; " La Vita 
e la Coltura Italian a al Tempo di Dante," by 
various writers, and a further instalment of the 
work entitled " Poesie di Mille Autori intorno 
di Dante Allighieri," which, intended to fill 
twelve volumes, will be " a complete collection 
of poems, including those written in imitation 
of Dante, in all languages." Sig. Carlo del 
Balzo is the editor of this work. In literary 
history, Sig. A. Belloni has written an account 
of the seventeenth century, Sig. G. Fumagalli 
has compiled a " Parini Album," Sig. de 
Amicis has published " Memorie," and Sig. 
Vittorio Pica has discussed recent French au- 
thors in a volume entitled "Letteratura d'Ec- 
cezione." An important life of Leopardi has 
been published, described as written by the 
poet himself, but in reality compiled by the 
editor, Sig. G. Piergili, being a mosaic of ex- 
tracts from Leopardi's writings. Sig. d'An- 
nunzio's "Laudi del Cielo, del Mare, della 
Terra, e degli Eroi," including a hymn in 
praise of Dante, is a book " full of images, 
visions, and thoughts of wonderful beauty, with 
a faint archaic perfume of Franciscan poetry." 
Other volumes of poetry are "Poemetti," by 
Sig. G. Pascoli ; " Leggenda Eterna," by Sig- 
norina Aganoor ; " Primavira Fiorentina," by 
Sig. Ferrari ; and " Canzoni," by Sig. Antonio 
della Porta. The first place among novels be- 
longs to the " Fuoco " of Sig. d'Annunzio. 
Other novels are " L'lllusione," by Sig. F. de 
Roberto ; " La Signorina," by Sig. G. Rovetta ; 
" II Giuoco dell' Amore," by Sig. Ugo Ojetti ; 
" Sant' Elena," by Sig. G. Rossi ; " Le Mili- 
taresse," by Captain O. San Giacomo ; " Un 
Duello," by Sig. F. Crispolti ; and A Rac- 
colta," by Signorina A. Giacomelli. The one 
noteworthy theatrical success Sig. Giacosa's 
"Come le Foglie" has already been men- 
tioned ; of theatrical interest are Sig. Rasi's 
" I Comici Italiani," a richly illustrated work, 
and the translation of Shelley's " Cenci " made 
by Sig. A. de Bosis. This tragedy will soon 
be produced upon the Italian stage, which 
should do something to put the poet's country- 
men to shame. Many works of historical in- 
terest have appeared. We note the first vol- 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



91 



times of the " Rerum Italic-arum Scriptores," 
" La Fine d' un Regno," by Sig. R. de Cesare ; 
" Storia d' Italia Contemporanea," by Sig. 
Paolo Orsi ; and " II Centre di Firenze," a 
volume issued by the Commune of Florence. 
The writer glances in conclusion at the scien- 
tific output, remarking that " the archaeological 
discoveries at Rome, the Stele arcaica, the 
Oriental Congress, the Congress of Christian 
Archaeology, the centenaries of Paulus Diac- 
onus and Francesco Filelf o, the commemoration 
of the great legal writer Francesco Carrara, of 
Lucca, and other events, have given rise to 
many valuable publications." Senator D. 
Comparetti's monograph on the Stele arcaica 
is particularly noteworthy. Of philosophical 
publications, the most important seem to be 
" Le Mostruosita dello Spirito," by Sig. Ven- 
turi ; " Rosmini-Spencer," by Sig. G. Vidari ; 
"Nord e Sud," by Sig. F. S. Nitti ; and "II 
Governo Locale Inglese e le Sue Relazioni con 
la Vita Nazionale," by Sig. Pietro Bertolini. 

Mr. C. Brinchmann, writing of Norwegian 
literature, naturally gives the first place to Dr. 
Ibsen's " When We Dead Awake," and ac- 
cepts the sub-title, " a dramatic epilogue," as 
meaning that this work " is to be the last link 
in the chain of ideas that have occupied his 
mind since * A Doll Home ' appeared." Herr 
Jonas Lie, like Dr. Ibsen, has chosen an artist's 
career for the subject of his this year's novel. 

" Both writers seem to have drawn largely on per- 
sonal experience, their difference of temperament being 
made clearly evident. Where Dr. Ibsen's drama re- 
veals concentrated self-consciousness coupled with much 
that is tender, Herr Jonas Lie's novel, Faste Forland,' 
shows its author's frank disposition and absolute faith 
in the eventual triumph of life's healthy instincts, as 
clearly as when in his youth, after the usual fate of an 
inexperienced financial promoter, the inevitable final 
shock only broke the chrysalis to send forth the novelist. 
And all the best qualities of this delightful narrator 
show themselves once again in this his latest volume, 
which would doubtless appeal favorably to many in the 
country that love Dickens. On the other hand, English 
readers more seriously inclined would value the later 
books of Herr Arne Garborg for their clear reasoning 
and fearless inquiries into life's realities, presented as 
they are with a masterly perfection of language and 
imagery. His last Christmas production, ' Den Burt- 
komne Faderen,' is a clever narrative in monologue 
form about silenced doubts and fears, written with the 
same purpose to fight the good fight and win back the 
belief in an all-good, almighty Ruler. In an article like 
this it is only possible to point out how intelligent, think- 
ing readers of Herr Garborg's book are charmed by the 
purer atmosphere into which he leads them, where no 
clash of arms resounds." 

Other works of interest are " Harald Svan's 
Mother," an " Aristophanic Comedy " by Herr 



G. Heiberg ; " Gammelholm," a " grand novel " 
by Herr Peter Egge ; " Norges Daemring," a 
descriptive history of Norwegian literature 
during the thirties, by Professor G. Gran ; and 
a biography of Welhaven, by Professor A. 
Lochen. The death of J. B. Halvorsen, who 
had almost completed his "Norsk Forfatter 
Lexicon," has deprived Norway of its greatest 
authority on literary matters. Certain philo- 
logical publications have brought on 
" A renewed contest between the rival camps of Lands- 
maal and Rigsmaal, one side urging the substitution of 
an artificial aggregate of dialects for the usual Norwe- 
gian written language, the other opposing any such inno- 
vation, the two representatives of the contending par- 
ties being the poets Herr Bjornson and Herr Garborg." 

Professor A. Belcikowski gives an interest- 
ing account of Polish belles lettres for the year. 

" The Nestor of our novelists, Mr. T. T. Jez, a man 
who has rendered many services to literature, has re- 
cently increased the number of valuable works which 
he has written by publishing a tale, By the Waters of 
Babylon,' which describes the melancholy life led by 
the Polish refugees in Paris. Madame E. Orzeszko, who 
also belongs to the older generation, still continues to 
improve, so far, at least, as the artistic form of her fic- 
tion is concerned, and, in my opinion at any rate, her 
latest romance, ' The Argonauts,' is even more mature 
than any of her previous efforts." 

Other works of fiction are " The Homeless 
Race," by Mr. S. Zeromski ; " Risztau " and 
" The Abyss of Misery," by Mr. W. Sieros- 
zewski ; " The Eye of the Prophet," by Mr, 
W. Lozinski; "For a Million," by Mr. A. 
Gruszecki ; " Letters of a Madman," by Mr. 
A. Niemojewski ; and " The Forest," by Mr. 
W. Zmudski. The leader of the moderns, 
" Mr. S. Przybyszewski, writes his poetry in prose, and 
continues the practice in his recent effusions, ' On the 
Sea,' ' In the Path of Souls,' and ' Androgyne,' but ex- 
cept to the initiated he remains unintelligible ; the 
thought in his works loses itself in dreamy phantoms 
and apocalyptic phraseology. There is nothing of im- 
portance in the way of drama. There are some new 
farces and some plays by authors of no repute, who have 
made no real addition to the literature of the stage." 

The recent celebration of the fifth centenary 
of the University of Cracow led to the appear- 
ance of several works in the history of Polish 
education. A " History of Polish Literature," 
in six volumes, by Mr. P. Chmielowski, is " the 
first work of the kind which has afforded a 
synthetic account of the whole of our litera- 
ture." Other books are " Literary Criticism 
in France," by Mr. E. Przewoski ; " The Devil 
in Poetry," by Mr. J. Matuszewski ; " St. 
Francis of Assisi," by Mr. E. Porembowicz ; 
and " Studies and Sketches from the History 
of Art and Civilization," by Mr. Sokolowski.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



Mr. Constantine Balmont writes of literary 
Russia in somewhat pessimistic strain. Although 
the past year witnessed the Pushkin centenary, 
" There did not appear a single book or a single essay 
worthy of the great poet, and the historical date which 
should have been the joyful festival of a great people 
forms another ignominious page in literary chronicles." 

Count Tolstoy's " Resurrection " has been the 
one great work of the year. 

" It presents a remarkably complicated picture, parts 
of which may produce a frigid impression upon the 
spectator, or even shock his feelings, but it is, consid- 
ered as a whole, a magnificent fresco not to be forgot- 
ten, and unique. It is impossible to express any deep 
regrets that Count Leo Tolstoi has not openly given 
himself up to a purely artistic impulse, as he did in his 
Homerically great novels ' Anna Karenina ' and ' War 
and Peace.' But in spite of all the fatiguing deficien- 
cies of his improving and sermonizing manner, the new 
novel shows that Tolstoi even now, when his life is 
drawing to a close, may furnish us with types and 
create effects with all the force of youth. The descrip- 
tion of spring at the beginning of the novel; the de- 
scription of the maison publique and the fallen women; 
the description of the malodorous prison, which de- 
pressed even the attendants in it; the breaking up of 
the ice; the autumnal night when the heroine Katusha 
runs after the train in which Nekhludov, who has de- 
ceived her, is departing; the various scenes of convict 
life all these are pictures such as show an artist of 
the first rank who understands how to be responsive to 
the most varying demands." 

The work of next importance in the year's lit- 
erature is " Thomas Gordeyev," a novel by 
Mr. Maxim Gorski. 

" This novel, which depicts the life of the tradesmen 
who live about the Volga, is as complete and finished 
as a lyrical poem. The types are powerfully drawn 
with bold strokes, and the language of the tradesmen, 
always picturesque and incisive, has for the first time 
in Russia found its artist." 

Mr. Merezhovski has written " The Resurrec- 
tion of the Gods," a romance having Leonardo 
da Vinci for its hero. 

" A certain change is perceptible in the ordinary life 
of contemporary Russian singers, owing to the circum- 
stance that a poetical club has been established at St. 
Petersburg, founded by Mr. K. K. Sluchevski, the best 
of living Russian poets; and a company for the publi- 
cation of books, called the Scorpion,' has been started 
at Moscow, around which the younger bards have 
grouped themselves." 

Important new editions of the poets Tiutchev 
and Fet, and of the critic Bielinski, have been 
published. Among works of scholarship the 
following should be mentioned : " Village 
Economy in Muscovy in the Sixteenth Cen- 
tury," by Mr. N. Rozhkov ; " Aids to Lec- 
tures on Russian History," by Mr. B. Kliu- 
chevski ; " The Economic Development of 
Europe Till the Rise of Capitalism," by Mr. 
Maxim Kovalevski ; " European Novels Dur- 



ing Two-Thirds of the Nineteenth Century," 
by Mr. P. Boborikin ; and " The Struggle for 
Idealism," by Mr. A. Volinski. Generally 
speaking, the writer thinks that 
"The season just closed has shown more life than that 
which preceded it. The inevitable separation between 
1 fathers ' and ' children ' raises the temperature of jour- 
nalistic life. Unfortunately the opponents of all that is 
new in literature, seeing almost a mortal sin in the crea- 
tion of new forms of poetical production, appear to be 
intellectually flaccid, and greet the constant struggle of 
ideas with a heap of interjections. But youth must be 
young, and no amount of shrieks can prevent us from 
celebrating our poetical May." 

Last of all in the series of reports, we come 
to Don Rafael Altamira's account of Spanish 
literature. 

" No one, it may be assumed, will be surprised that 
after the disastrous issue of the struggle in Cuba and 
the Philippines the intellectual classes in Spain have felt 
the necessity of studying plans for national reorganiza- 
tion, and have been led to consider the causes of our 
decline and our inferiority to other nations and the 
means of bringing about a new renascence. Clearly, 
while they interest the nation more than any others, 
books that deal with these questions offer to foreigners 
valuable sources of information regarding the actual 
condition of our commonwealth, and the aspirations of 
those among us who form, or may form, the governing 
classes." 

" El Problema Nacional," by the late Macias 
Picavea, makes 

" A truly scientific study of the Spanish people and the 
problems before it, tracing the general outlines of its 
innate peculiarities and their history, and analyzing the 
influence of its physical condition, and especially the 
causes of its decline and also the remedies for them, the 
chief of which he considers to be popular education." 

Other works in this field are " La Moral de la 
Derrota," by Senor Morote ; " Hacia otra 
Espana," by Senor Maeztu ; " Problemas del 
Dia," by Senor Silio ; " Del Desastro Nacional 
y Sus Consecuencias," by Senor Isern ; and 
"Los Desastres y la Regeneracion de Espana," 
by Senor Rodriguez Martinez. Addresses upon 
this subject have also been made, and after- 
wards printed, by the author of the present 
article, by Senor Echegaray and by Senora 
Bazan. Works of erudition are mentioned in 
great numbers, the most conspicuous place 
being given to the Festschrift inscribed to 
Professor Menendez y Pelayo, and containing 
fifty-seven monographs by the most distin- 
guished Spanish and foreign scholars. Fiction 
is illustrated by "Morsamor," by Senor Valera; 
three new " Episodios Nacionales," by Senor 
Galdos ; and a volume of stories by Senora 
Bazan. In poetry and the drama little work 
of any consequence has appeared during the 
year.

Two GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
OF ENGLAND.* 



The term Public Schools, in English usage 
as distinct from American usage, denotes boys' 
boarding-schools that fit for the universities 
These schools are established upon private 
foundations, and are made free only to a small 
number of day scholars, called " foundationers," 
in the town in which they are situated. Thus, the 
public school is merely set off from the private 
tutor, as when Thomas Arnold writes that his 
experience " seems to point out no one plan of 
education as decidedly the best ; it only says 
that public education is the best when it an- 
swers. A very good private tutor would tempt 
one to try private education ; or a very good 
public school, with connections with the boys at 
it, might induce one to venture upon public." 
The stories of two of these great English pub- 
lic schools Rugby and Charterhouse form 
the subjects of two excellent volumes of a series 
which is to cover the whole system of the lead- 
ing public schools of England. Rugby is treated 
by the Assistant Master, Mr. H. C. Bradby, 
who has, while confessedly giving nothing new, 
compiled the main facts into a useful sketch. 
Rugby School was founded in 1567, " in ac- 
cordance with the will of Lawrence Sheriffe, 
citizen and grocer of London," to be a free 
school " chiefly for the children of Rugby and 
Brownsover." For the first century of its life it 
had but a precarious existence ; but with Henry 
Holyoake, who held the head mastership for 
forty-three years, from 1687 to 1731, it began 
a vigorous career. Thomas James, Henry 
Ingles, and John Wooll were successors of 
note. Of the last named it is recorded that he 
" did not forget Solomon's precept, and we read 
of one occasion when in the extraordinarily short 
space of fifteen minutes he flogged the whole of 
a form of thirty-eight boys, who had thought 
fit to put a stop to a lesson by the simple expe- 
dient of going away." 

After this redoubtable flogger came the 
greatest of all masters, Thomas Arnold. 

" What Arnold did for public schools was to alter and 
expand, to a degree which amounted to a revolution, 
the aims and objects which these institutions set before

themselves. Before his time the avowed object of the 
public schools was to impart learning; systems and 
discipline were subservient to this end, and though inci- 
dentally they had other effects, their main object was to 
render learning possible and effective; if this object was 
attained their work was done, and they were judged by 
their success or failure in this respect. Arnold took a 
much broader view of the objects of education; while 
deeply impressed with the importance of learning, he 
realized that it was only a part of education, and that 
the great end and aim of education was the formation of 
character. This was the great object which was to domi- 
nate all others: to this end learning and everything else 
must be subservient. The ideal which he set before 
himself was to train boys to become not merely scholars 
but Christian gentlemen. . . . He accepted the two 
great features of English public schools, the liberty 
allowed to all, and the power exercised by the senior 
over the junior boys; but he bent all his energies to 
bring it about that the liberty should not be mere 
license, and that the power should be exercised for 
good and not for evil, as had been too often the case. 
. . . Arnold's greatness and his success lay in the fact 
that he did inspire a very large proportion of boys 
placed in authority with something of his own spirit of 
duty, and that in the minds even of boys who did not 
come into personal contact with him he implanted a 
feeling of their responsibility as members of a great 
society. In this way he did succeed in showing what a 
public school, in spite of its imperfections, might,' to 
use his own phrase, ' and ought to be.' He did succeed 
in rousing people to the fact that the aim of education 
was not merely to stimulate the intellectual faculties 
but the moral faculties as well, that the great object to 
be pursued was the formation of character. In this he 
was a pioneer, and his example soon had great results." 

The most noted men of letters who have 
come from Rugby are Walter Savage Landor, 
A. H. Clough, and Matthew Arnold. Lander's 
independent and fiery personality displayed 
itself at Rugby as in all his later life. When 
the head master knocked at his door, his only 
reply was, " Get thee hence, Satan ! " and " it 
was for writing scurrillous verses in the head 
master's album that that strange genius had 
finally to be removed." Lander's name is 
linked with Rugby by the lines on ' The Swift 
joining the Avon," just as Arnold's is by his 
great poem on " Rugby Chapel." Thomas 
Hughes, who has been described as " the incar- 
nation of the highest form of the British school- 
boy, the best type of the character of the school 
which moulded him," has immortalized Rugby 
scenes in " Tom Brown's Schooldays." 

The second chapter of this book gives a 
detailed description of the buildings and 
grounds. A large and well-equipped art mu- 
seum is an unusual feature in a boy's school, 
but it seems very serviceable at Rugby. The 
third chapter gives a brief account of the work 
of the school, while the fourth is devoted to 
societies, games, etc. Several pages are given

to football, and we note that this game is " com- 
pulsory for all below the Sixth who have not 
got a medical certificate of unfitness." 

Charterhouse, though not so familiar a name 
as Rugby, is one of the great and venerable 
English public schools. It dates from 1609, 
and was founded by Thomas Sutton, a banker 
of London. The name Charterhouse is a cor- 
rupt form of " Chartreuse," it being situated 
on the site of " L'Abbaye Chartreuse " at 
Smithfield ; and hence the name Charterhouse 
is properly spelled as one word, and members 
of the school are known as " Carthusians." 
By the Chantry Acts of Henry VIII. and 
Edward VI., a large number of grammar 
schools where Latin had been taught were 
done away with. 

" Now Latin was then the universal language of in- 
ternational commerce. Knowledge of Latin at that 
time was as necessary for foreign commerce as a 
knowledge of French and German is now. Sutton, a 
man of business in many lands, must have felt that his 
countrymen, who were losing their Latin, were at a 
disadvantage in commerce, just as boys who neglect 
modern languages are at the present time. So in 
founding a grammar school Sutton was founding the 
equivalent of a modern technical school." 

Charterhouse cannot count so distinguished 
a line of masters as Rugby. One of the early 
masters, Robert Brooke, " was ejected for flog- 
ging boys who did not share his political 
views." Dr. Russell, who was head master in 
the early part of this century, abolished flog- 
ging, and substituted fines, to the indignation 
of the boys who regarded flogging " as very 
gentlemanly, but fines most ungentlemanly." 
The rebellion against fines was so fierce that 
Dr. Russell re-adopted flogging, and one of the 
students of the times writes that on the day 
when fines were abolished, " when we all 
walked into school together, we found a per- 
fect forest of birch rods, and I should think 
that the whole school-time of two hours was 
expended in the use and application of them!" 
The rod is now rarely used at Charterhouse. 
In the realm of letters, Thackeray was the 
most distinguished son of Charterhouse, and 
he shows in his writings a devoted attachment 
to the school. 

In 1872 Charterhouse was removed from 
London to new buildings at Godalming. Chap- 
ter II. of the volume devoted to this school is 
an illustrated description of the " New Char- 
terhouse." Chapters III.- VIII. give accounts 
of the varied life there, work, plays, discipline, 
manners, prizes, expenses, etc. Charterhouse, 
like other public schools, has been greatly hu- 



manized in the last few decades ; legalized 
fighting and the worse forms of bullying have 
been suppressed, and the power of the monitor 
over the fag has been restricted. It is also 
notable that now in this school, where, as in 
other schools, athleticism has been dominant, 
" intellectual pursuits are regarded with toler- 
ance "; the scholarly boy is no longer subject 
to constant persecution. Another change at 
Charterhouse is one which does not meet with 
the unlimited approval of the author namely, 
the mapping out of the boy's leisure time by 
set games and entertainments, so that he no 
longer has time fully to himself to act upon his 
own initiative. 

"There does appear a distinct danger of public 
schools becoming more and more what they are some- 
times said to be, ' the home of the commonplace.' 
Hitherto their tradition has been to encourage manliness, 
self-reliance, independence, and a high sense of duty; 
the monitorial system taught all, first how to obey, and 
afterwards how to command, while the unrestricted 
life fostered originality and self-reliance. What will 
be the results of the present method, time must show." 

These little handbooks are compends of in- 
formation, and are presumably meant more to 
be consulted than to be read. However, they 
are clearly written and well illustrated, and 
will be of considerable interest to the general 
reader, and of special interest to the educator, 
the tourist, the alumnus, and the patron.

A TRANSITION PERIOD 
AMERICAN HISTORY.* 



The years which intervened between the 
second term of President Monroe and the tri- 
umph of " the people " in the election of their 
favorite Andrew Jackson were years marked by 
many changes in the political, social, industrial, 
and intellectual life of the United States. The 
departure from the scene, with the passing of 
Monroe, of the generation which had been influ- 
ential in the revolutionary movements, and the 
incoming of a new stock of voters, many of 
them born " since the war," were accompanied 
by a corresponding shifting of ideas which made 
the " era of good feelings " notable for the nu- 
merous revolutions effected in thought and life. 

The fifth volume of Mr. McMaster's " His- 
tory of the People of the United States " is 
largely given to an examination of these revo-

lutions. After some consideration of the pre- 
liminary questions that later became important 
in the settlement of the Texas and Oregon 
problems, an extended chapter deals with the 
Monroe Doctrine, tracing its history up to the 
time when it was formulated by the President 
whose name it bears, the occasion which called 
it forth being indicated at length. The history 
of the Holy Alliance is so related as to show 
how a " meaningless pledge " of 1815, framed 
in a moment of religious excitement, led the 
allied rulers into a position where they were 
forced to oppose all popular government, until 
at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 they became organ- 
ized into a mutual association for the insurance 
of monarchy. This chapter is a fair type of 
the volume, which is largely taken up with 
essays descriptive of the development of ideas 
in the United States, essays on Socialistic and 
Labor Reforms, on the Negro Problem, the 
Industrial Revolution, Early Literature, Brit- 
ish Criticism of the United States, the Com- 
mon School in the First Half Century, and 
Political Ideas in the First Half Century. 
These essays lead up to the surprisingly rapid 
changes of the period under consideration, and 
in many instances the interplay of forces is 
admirably, if perhaps unconsciously, indicated. 
The account is very interesting of the agitation 
by laboring men for a shorter day, of the influ- 
ence upon labor and society of the invention 
and introduction of labor-saving machinery, of 
the preaching of doctrines of social betterment 
with the accompaniment of the formation of 
communities for the working out of theories. 
Men are taught the wisdom of cutting loose 
from old party ties, and the attractiveness of 
the anti-masonic party is in a measure under- 
stood as people look to see the new leader or 
the most likely new theory. 

The beginnings of the importance of urban 
life are noted in such striking paragraphs as this : 

" At New York, now the metropolis of the country, 
the growth of the city was astonishing to its own citi- 
zens. The population numbered one hundred and sixty- 
two thousand, an increase of forty thousand in five 
years. To keep pace with such an inpouring of strang- 
ers was hardly possible. More than three thousand 
buildings were under way in 1825, yet such was the 
press that not an unoccupied dwelling house existed in 
the entire city, and it was quite common to see families 
living in houses with unfinished floors, with windows 
destitute of sashes, and in which the carpenters had not 
hung a single door. Nor was this an accident. Year 
after year the same thing occurred, and on one first of 
May the great ' moving day ' three hundred home- 
less people gathered in the park with their household 
goods and were lodged in the jail till the houses they 
had rented were finished and made habitable." 



The same activity was indicated in business 
circles as in domestic. 

" Five hundred new mercantile houses were said to 
have been established in the city in the early months of 
1825, a statement well borne out by the crowded con- 
dition of the mercantile newspapers. The ' Gazette ' in 
seven days contained 1,115 new advertisements, and in 
one issue, a week later, printed 213, and stated that 23 
others were left out for want of space." 

The lack of preparation of the people for the 
rapid changes can hardly be better indicated 
than by mention of a newspaper which would 
let twenty-three advertisements escape it be- 
cause of " want of space." As another indica- 
tion, it may be mentioned that of the three 
thousand dwellings reported as building in 
1825, it is related that, " Most of these houses 
were built by speculators, and were erected so 
cheaply and hastily that several fell down while 
in course of construction ; others were torn 
down by order of the authorities." 

The attempts of the citizens to wrestle with 
the new problems of city life naturally were 
extremely faulty. The cleaning of the streets, 
the protection from fire and from evil doers, 
the lighting of streets and houses, caused the 
residents of the new cities just as much trouble 
as they do people of to-day, and, as presented 
by Mr. McMaster, stand in suggestive opposi- 
tion to the difficulties of rural life, where vast 
sums were spent in schemes for the improve- 
ment of transportation, and thousands of dollars 
were buried in connection with efforts to solve 
problems in which highway and canal and rail- 
road figured largely. The questions of the 
city and the country differed materially, but in 
each place the same characteristics marked the 
period, the temptation to deal in futures, a 
wild rush for speculation, an abundance of 
cheap money, social distress, relief laws, then a 
gradual settling down on a firmer and steadier 
basis. 

The changes which were taking place in 
political ideas were as numerous and as marked 
as those in the field of social life. New and 
more liberal constitutions were adopted, grant- 
ing a wider suffrage and more generous privi- 
leges. Ideas advanced in theory as part of 
the revolutionary movement became realized in 
fact. A number of perplexing and puzzling 
problems presented themselves for solution, 
the status of the free negro, the quieting of 
Indian titles (notably in Georgia), the ever 
important matter of slavery extension, the ac- 
tual working of tariff provisions. Put these 
with an occasional diplomatic question, the 
Panama Congress, the settlement of the dis-

puted Maine boundary, the future of Oregon, 
the possibilities in the direction of Texas, 
and one has the panorama passing before him, 
which Mr. McMaster has successfully de- 
scribed. 

The political history in the volume is com- 
paratively unimportant. The discussion of the 
problems mentioned everywhere dominates. 
But a word must be said of the account of the 
development of the "Jackson men," and the 
attractiveness of the study of the machinery of 
popular elections which was being formed in 
opposition to the congressional caucus. Why 
it was that Jackson had such a hold upon the 
common people will certainly be clearer to 
anyone after reading Mr. McMaster's story. 

In mechanical construction this volume, 
which is the smallest of the five in the series, 
reveals the haste in which it was printed, a 
haste which is apparent notwithstanding the 
length of time of the publishers' preliminary 
announcements of " ready soon " and " in 
press," promises for whose fulfilment eager 
students waited long. Careful proof-reading 
would have prevented such mistakes as " Nile's 
Register" (p. 7), "$3,720 dollars" (p. 24), 
"Washinton" (p. 24), "the French . . . 
was about to invade and seize Cuba" (p. 53). 
A little care might have avoided anachronisms 
in maps, as in the one on page 121, where the 
United States in 1826 is shown with one of the 
lines marked "confirmed by Mexico in 1828." 
The same map indicates the line of 54 40 ' as 
being quite a distance north of the line of 55. 
Chicago and Milwaukee are given place, and 
some names of places important in early his- 
tory are misspelled. In a number of pages the 
plates are faulty, especially in the foot-notes.

STUDIES OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.* 

For a long time no new books of serious 
character dealing with the Human Races were 
printed in English. After the battle over 
monogenistic and polygenistic ideas, giving rise 
to such books as Nott and Gliddon's works and 
Knox' " On Race," the only serviceable work 
was Peschel's " Races of Men." The long 
silence was broken by Brinton's " Races and 
Peoples," which was quickly followed by 
Keane's " Ethnology." Then Ratzel was given 
an English dress, and recently three highly

Scott. (Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.) 



important books have appeared, Keane's " Man, 
Past and Present," Ripley's " Races of Europe," 
and the book before us, Deniker's " Races of 
Man." The author is Librarian at the Museum 
of Natural History in Paris, and has long 
been prominent in the anthropological work of 
France. 

The alternative title, " An Outline of An- 
thropology and Ethnology," gives a fair idea of 
the scope of the work. The first seven chap- 
ters study the characters investigated by an- 
thropologists the Somatic (Morphological, 
Physiological, and Pathological), the Ethnic 
(including Linguistic), and Sociological (Ma- 
terial Life, Psychic Life, Family Life, and 
Social Life) characters. Attention is then 
turned to Systematic Ethnology. In one chapter 
the matter of Classification of Races and Peo- 
ples is presented. The method of defining races 
by the synthesis of a few fundamental somato- 
logical characters, carefully examined and 
traced out through humanity, was first fully 
carried out by Topinard, who thus defined nine- 
teen original races. Deniker pursues the same 
method, but makes out and names twenty-nine 
races. These are succinctly described. In 
grouping these in a table, the author considers 
the hair as a fundamental character for sub- 
division purposes and recognizes six groups : 

(A) Woolly hair, broad nose (four types) ; 

(B) Curly hair or wavy (four types) ; (C) 
Wavy brown or black hair, dark eyes (seven 
types) ; (D) Fair, wavy or straight hair, light 
eyes (two types) ; (E) Straight or wavy hair, 
dark, black eyes (four types) ; (F) Straight 
hair (eight types). These twenty-nine race- 
types, when grouped to show relationship, give 
rise to some seventeen new groups which are 
characterized and then rather unsatisfactorily 
arranged in a two-dimension tabulation. 

The author next examines the distribution of 
these races and groups, taking up five great 
world divisions in the following order : Europe, 
Asia, Africa, Oceania, America. He is every- 
where exact and rigid, laying down hard and 
fast lines. There is no doubt or uncertainty in 
his statements, no controversies or difficulties. 
Here we have such and such types, pure or 
unmixed ; there we find such and such a com- 
bination. The author is undoubtedly too arbi- 
trary, yet some degree of arbitrariness is inher- 
ent in the nature of such a treatise. It is best, 
perhaps, to admit his assumptions ; but we ought 
always to remember that all types have not yet 
been finally marked out, and that many conclu- 
sions here presented will surely be modified. 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



97 



It is fair to say, however, that the author has 
read widely and has carefully weighed his 
reading. 

Interest naturally centres in Deniker's treat- 
ment of the populations of Europe, a subject 
which has engaged his attention for years, and 
upon which he is high authority. It will be 
remembered that Dr. Ripley, whose book we 
recently noticed in these columns, claimed but 
three European types Mediterranean, Alpine, 
Teutonic. It was a view ideally simple and 
attractive. Deniker recognizes six principal 
and four secondary races. Two of his six 
principal races are fair-haired, four are dark- 
haired. The six principal races are the 
Northern, Eastern, Ibero-insular, Western or 
Cevenole, Littoral or Atlanto-Mediterranean, 
Adriatic or Dinaric. Each of these is described 
and the influence of each in the present popu- 
lations examined. On the whole, without 
claiming for it inerrancy, Deniker's classifica- 
tion better suits us than Ripley's. In his dis- 
cussion of each world district, the author first 
presents an outline of the prehistoric evidence 
regarding past populations, and then discusses 
those of the present. 

We always read, with great satisfaction, the 
discussions, in these general treatises, of those 
areas with which we are least familiar. It is 
only when we read those dealing with ground 
most familiar to us that we become doubtful 
and hesitant. Where in the large list of Eu- 
ropean writers have we a discussion of American 
ethnologic problems that is half-way satisfac- 
tory ? Peschel fell far short. Eatzel, Schmidt, 
Keane, Nadaillac, always just fail to grasp re- 
lations and bearings. Deniker does little better. 
The realization of this failure in the field we 
best know always leaves a haunting dread lest 
other fields may be as bad. Let us hope not. 

A word of criticism must be made either of 
the translator or proof-reader of this book. 
The statement that there are but two thousand 
Livonians is almost as startling as that the 
English lung capacity is 3.7 cubic metres. One 
of the best features of the book is its series of 
tables of measurements ; but unless their proof- 
reading has been done with great care their 

value is gone. -c,

RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION.* 

Perhaps the most significant of the recent an- 
nouncements of educational publications is that of 
the " Teacher's Professional Library," edited by 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler and published by the 
Macmillan Company. The published list contains 
books on the various studies of the secondary schools, 
to be written by favorably known teachers. That the 
editor and publishers should venture on so extensive 
an enterprise speaks well for the educational intelli- 
gence and interest of the country, at least as these 
gentlemen view matters. They evidently expect 
teachers and scholars to respond liberally to their 
enterprise, and it is to be hoped that they will do so. 
It fell to the lot of Dr. D. E. Smith, of the Brockport, 
N. Y., Normal School, to open the series, which he 
has done in a commendable way in his " Teaching of 
Elementary Mathematics." If the opinion which is 
held in some quarters to the effect that of late the 
teaching of mathematics has suffered in the atten- 
tion that it has received in comparison with some 
other subjects, this volume will do something to re- 
dress the balance. Again, one of the serious educa- 
tional questions of the time is, What parts of math- 
ematics shall be taught in the elementary schools? 
One of the merits of the book is that it will help to 
find a practical answer to this question. For ex- 
ample, Dr. Smith's criticisms on the current arith- 
metic and suggestions of reform are thoroughly 
sensible and judicious. The author considers his

ers for whom the book is intended cannot fail to 
find illuminating and helpful. Our severest criti- 
cism of the book is that the author has not always 
distributed his matter in as clear and logical a way 
as he might have done. The mechanical make-up 
and appearance of the volume are excellent. 

Professor H. B. Adams gives in " Public Educa- 
tional Work in Baltimore " an interesting account 
of such work done since 1876 by or under the aus- 
pices of the Johns Hopkins University. It is a 
good contribution to the literature of University 
Extension, although the work that is treated has 
not always, or generally, borne that name. A be- 
ginning was made before University Extension had 
been introduced into the country ; moreover, the 
claim is made that the first conscious attempt to 
introduce English university methods into this coun- 
try were made in 1887 by individuals connected with 
Johns Hopkins. The monograph closes with an inter- 
esting but rather strained attempt to find educational 
meaning in Washington's relations to Baltimore. 

When the first reports of the University Ele- 
mentary School of Chicago reached the outside 
world, they were not taken seriously save by isolated 
persons here and there. It was not anticipated by 
teachers and educators generally that the school 
would last long, or that it would teach any important 
lessons, save one very old lesson that has been so 
many times repeated that an additional repetition 
can hardly make it more impressive. But to the 
surprise of persons holding this view, the school has 
lived on until it is now in its fourth year, and has 
more eyes fixed upon it to-day, undoubtedly, than 
any other elementary school in the country. This 
fact must be admitted, but just what may be its 
significance is a question that would call out a 
diversity of answers. In our view its meaning will 
be found in large part, but not wholly, in current 
dissatisfaction with our conventional common school 
education, and desire to find something better. 
Although considerable has been written about this 
school, we have not had hitherto an authorized 
statement of its aims and methods. This lack is 
now supplied by Professor Dewey, the author of the 
school, in his book entitled " The School and So- 
ciety." This volume consists of three lectures " sup- 
plemented by a statement of the University school," 
the whole comprehending but one hundred and 
twenty-five pages. But small as it is, it is not 
impossible that the book will come to hold some 
such prominence among the pedagogical books of 
the time as the school itself is now holding among 
the schools of the country. The central ideas of 
the three lectures are that the school has entirely 
failed to keep pace with social progress, and must 
be readjusted to society ; that, owing in great part 
to this failure, the school has fallen out of relation 
to the life of the child and must in some way be 
brought back into such relation, and that, as a re- 
sult of these two facts, there is now great waste in 
education going on. Furthermore, the readjust- 
ment of the school to society and to child-life can- 



not be effected on the lines of reconstructed scholas- 
ticism or a new course of study, but must be 
accomplished on the lines of manual training, cook- 
ing, sewing, drawing, modelling, and the other " fads 
and frills " which call down the wrath of educational , 
conservatives. While no one can tell what the future 
of the University Elementary School may be, it does 
not require much foresight to see that it can never 
become the type of the public elementary school : its 
cost and the delicacy of the organization make this 
impossible. But it would be a great mistake to 
identify the fortunes of the book and the fortunes of 
the school. The book has virtue, no matter what 
the future of the school may be. It is to be hoped, 
therefore, that teachers will be more interested in 
making some practical application of this virtue to the 
schools of the country than in watching the develop- 
ment of the little institution in Chicago that was the 
occasion of this virtue obtaining literary expression. 

It was perfectly natural that the promoters of 
the Ethical Culture movement should impress the 
Sunday school into their service, and that they 
should begin to produce a Sunday School literature. 
Still, so far as we are aware, Mr. Sheldon's " An 
Ethical Sunday School " is the first essay in that 
direction. The book has, however, other sources of 
interest. The distinction between the new type of 
school and the old one is thus expressed : 

" We desire that all that sanctity which in the con- 
ventional Sunday school has been connected with the 
word God ' should surround the thought of the Moral 
Law. It is the Moral Law which should sanctify the 
thought of God, rather than the thought of God which 
should sanctify the Moral Law." 

We are told further that the aim is 
" To associate the sentiments belonging to the Eternal, 
the Infinite, the Absolute, with the distinction between 
right and wrong, with the thought of the Moral Law, 
but not to use these words so that they shall become 
hackneyed before the child-mind has begun to have any 
conception at all as to what these words stand for." 

We do not propose to discuss the new ideal, or even 
to give an account of the modus by which it is pro- 
posed to realize it. On the latter point, the author 
tells us that his book is a description of the system 
of Sunday School work that has been developed in 
an Ethical Sunday School in St. Louis. He has 
evidently devoted much time and thought to the 
subject, and his work may, in our opinion, be read 
with advantage by the managers and teachers of 
conventional Sunday Schools. They may get from 
it some useful ideas of method and of systematic 
instruction, if nothing more. For ourselves, we 
think there is a valuable suggestion in the statement : 
"We undertake to develop certain tendencies of 
thought and feeling in the young, or to develop a cer- 
tain attitude of mind on the problems of life, rather than 
to give the young a specific knowledge or to impart 
definite beliefs or facts of scriptural history." 

" Educational Aims and Methods," by the veteran 
English educator, Sir Joshua Fitch, will naturally 
attract the attention of the better class of American

teachers, to whom he is so favorably known. These 
teachers will desire no other recommendation of the 
book than that it is, in a sense, supplementary to 
the author's well-known " Lectures on Teaching," 
which has been republished by more than one 
American house. The volume is composed of lec- 
tures and addresses that have been given at various 
times within the last few years before different 
audiences in England and America. These dis- 
courses treat of miscellaneous subjects, so that the 
book has no distinct centre of unity. The subjects 
dealt with lie in " the borderland " which " separates 
the corporate life of the school from the larger life 
of the family and the community," as Sir Joshua 
puts it, and are all interesting and important. The 
book contains fifteen lectures and addresses. 

That veteran educator of the Pacific Coast, Mr. 
John Sweet, has made a useful contribution to the 
literature of the profession that he has honored, in 
" American Public Schools." The peculiar feature 
of the book is that it is made up in something like 
equal measure of history and pedagogics ; a combi- 
nation for which, in the case of the great majority 
of teachers, much can be said. To this class of 
persons the volume may be strongly recommended. 

Professor MacCunn's " The Making of Charac- 
ter " is a valuable addition to the literature of moral 
training. The book covers a wide field of topics, 
and covers it well and wisely. Incalculably more 
valuable than intellectual training, moral training, 
in its nature, processes, and methods, if not in its 
results, is yet much less understood. There is, 
indeed, an extensive literature of moral counsel and 
exhortation, some of it of great value ; but there is 
a great lack of a body of definite and practical teach- 
ing, or a moral pedagogy, that teachers can use. 
This book is not just the book that is most needed, 
but it will do something to supply that need. It 
abounds in quotable passages. 

" Reading : How to Teach It," by Sarah Louise 
Arnold, Supervisor of Schools of Boston, Mass., is 
one of the most attractive and sensible books that 
has appeared on the subject in many a day. In 
choice of matter and in method of presentation it is 
thoroughly practical and exceedingly suggestive, its 
key-note being a setting forth of the best methods of 
teaching a pupil how to read and what to read, and 
of creating within him a permanent love for choicest 
reading. Every page shows the masterful author 
and the experienced supervisor. It is a fine contri- 
bution to this important branch of learning, and 
should be welcomed by every teacher of reading. 
We predict for it a large sale. 

"Advanced Elementary Science" is the latest 
volume in the "International Education Series." 
It is by Professor Edward Howe, author of " Sys- 
tematic Science Teaching," and is intended to pro- 
vide symmetrical outlines for grammar grades 
similar to those therein provided for primary grades. 
The book treats of the elements of botany, zoology, 
geology, mineralogy, and astronomy, and offers rich 
suggestions and illustrations of the best methods of 



presentation to pupils. The aim of the work, like 
that of its fore-runner, is the cultivation of accurate 
habits of observation, the acquirement of common 
facts, and the establishment of proper apperception 
bases for future scientific instruction. It will be ex- 
ceedingly helpful to the great mass of teachers in this 
field of work, and should receive a warm welcome. 

" The Logical Bases of Education," by J. Welton, 
Professor of Education in the Yorkshire College, 
Victoria University, is well written, thoughtful, and 
scholarly, and aims to point out a system of instruc- 
tion whereby logical habits of thinking and study 
can best be developed. It is, however, too far be- 
yond the grasp of the ordinary teacher to attract 
serious attention, or to be of much value as an edu- 
cational contribution. It could wisely be denomi- 
nated a Logic, and placed in that particular field. 

Mr. Seeley's " A History of Education " is de- 
signed especially for teachers preparing for exam- 
ination. The book is not based on theory, has no 
logical beginning or ending, makes no claim to 
thoroughness, but aims to furnish plain, accurate 
material of sufficient comprehensiveness to meet the 
demands of all reasonable examining boards. 

Professor F. E. Bolton's " Secondary School Sys- 
tem of Germany " is a very interesting volume. 
The book is the outcome of a year's residence de- 
voted to an examination of the school system and 
to a study of the underlying principles involved. 
It treats in a very clear and concise manner of the 
general organization and management of the schools, 
the status of the teacher, the course of study, the 
higher education of women, and of many other 
topics of special interest and value to American 
students. The author is especially happy in depict- 
ing those very features of the system which the 
average educator is most anxious to know about. 
The author is also unique in that he does not fall 
down and worship at the German educational shrine 
as so many are wont to do, but is as quick to por- 
tray their defects as their excellences. The book is 
a valuable contribution to the literature on this sub- 
ject, and should be extensively read. 

" The Nervous System of the Child," by Francis 
Warner, M.D., author of " The Study of School 
Children and their Training," is clear, comprehen- 
sive, and scientific, and is the result of long study 
and practice as teacher and physician. It treats of 
the following topics : the brain and body in infancy 
and early childhood ; the child at school ; observa- 
tion, description, and classification of children in 
school ; evolution of the child and his brain power ; 
physical care of the child, hygiene and feeding ; the 
training and teaching of young children ; advancing 
school method and teaching ; the nerve centres in 
infancy school life and adolescence, their health and 
training ; and mental hygiene and voluntary mental 
power. In view of the wide-spread interest in every- 
thing that pertains to the welfare of the child, these 
topics ought to prove of unusual interest to teachers 
and to the public generally. B. A. HINSDALE.

THE DIAL,

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

It is more than half a generation 
. since a few scientific men, to whom 

the situation had become an increas- 
ingly grave one, formed in Washington "The 
American Forestry Association," which has long 
labored under all the disadvantages pertaining to 
any movement the need of which is unrecognized 
by the people at large. When an American fron- 
tiersman sees a tree at any rate, on land over 
which he has any control he cuts it down. That 
is part of the instinct of clearing the ground for 
work. But the American lumberman has cleared 
it simply for profit, with no knowledge that thus he 
was creating inevitably not only arid lands, but dis- 
ease and other unpleasant conditions. Our forests 
have vanished not only before the axe and the gen- 
eral march of what we call civilization, but by the 
fires of yearly recurrence. Even now, as these 
words are written, the most glorious trees eye of 
man in this country has ever rested upon the 
redwoods of California are at the mercy of a 
lumber corporation, and the women of California 
are cogitating what to do about it. In short, while 
the meaning of a tree is becoming a trifle clearer 
to the general mind, we need all the education that 
can be given, in school and out, to fix the fact that 
man cannot make a tree, and that its destruction 
save for essential purposes is a crime. In good 
time, then, comes an admirable manual for just 
such ends, " North American Forests and For- 
estry," by an expert, Mr. Ernest Bruncken of the 
Wisconsin Forestry Commission ; his German name 
not only implying but insuring the patient, careful, 
indefatigable work that is evident in every page of 
the volume. The twelve chapters, with their full 
table of contents and index, mean a book that 
should be on the shelves of every lover of trees, 
and no less on those of every householder in city or 
country, since to act as it directs is now a recog- 
nized duty of the citizen. Waste is an American 
vice, waste of food, of material in a thousand 
ways, of life itself, in our hurry and rush. There 
is no need of surprise, but there is surely need for 
shame, as we read the story of our own wholesale 
destruction of what we have the right to use as a 
gift of nature, but never the right to waste or reck- 
lessly destroy. The book pleads for general educa- 
tion in this study, not alone for the personal knowl- 
edge and its pleasure, but as a national necessity, 
and it makes all the reasons plain. Mr. Bruncken's 
work is clear, definite, practical, above all in its 
definition of what Forestry really is, and the clear- 
est of statements as to what deforestation means in 
the life of the people. The final chapter, " Forestry 
as a Profession," opens up a new place in life for 
many a nature lover, and is as thoroughly common- 
sense as are other suggestions. The book is not a 
technical manual, save as some technicalities are a 
necessary part of the presentation. It is a very 
live, very earnest statement of needs, as well as a 



story of Forestry at home and abroad ; and every 
school that keeps Arbor Day should have it on the 
school library shelves, as motive and reason for the 
custom that Arbor Day is at last making a national 
matter. The book is published by the Messrs. 
Putnam. 

The bright side " The Story of Philadelphia'] ( Amer- 
of the story of ican Hook Co.), by Miss Lillian lone 
Philadelphia. Rhoades, is intended for use as a 
text-book in the public schools of that city, as an aid 
to " the training of pupils to intelligent and virtu- 
ous citizenship." The work is a good one for the 
purpose, so far as it goes, but it seems to us to go 
scarcely half way. It has apparently been prepared 
on the theory that the training aimed at is to be 
got by the pupil through the contemplation of the 
virtues and achievements of a historic past, without 
study of the municipal needs, conditions, and short- 
comings of the immediate past and the present. 
An ideal text-book of the kind for the young Phila- 
delphian would, we should think, display also the 
reverse side, so to speak, of the medal, and thus 
serve to foster not only a due sense of pride in the 
glories of the remoter past, but a knowledge of 
present-day abuses and deficiencies, and a deter- 
mination to remedy them. A keen realization of 
the mortifying fact that the city of Penn and 
Franklin, the Mecca of pilgrims to the shrine of 
American independence, had sunk, through the 
supineness of her citizens, into a notorious citadel 
of " bossism " and municipal corruption, might well 
prove even more useful in the arena of political 
action to the young Philadelphian than a thorough 
familiarity with the historical springs of civic self- 
complacency interestingly set forth by Miss Rhoades 
in the present volume. Indeed, to go farther, we 
are inclined to think that American youth in gen- 
eral has lost not a little in point of political judg- 
ment and efficiency through the vainglorious or un- 
critical historical text-book, which, in drawing up 
our national account, has unduly ignored the debit 
side of the ledger. Miss Rhoades's little book, how- 
ever, is, we repeat, good so far as it goes, and re- 
capitulates pleasantly, in a series of brief special 
chapters, a story the chief features of which should 
be familiar to every young American. Mr. Edward 
Brooks, Superintendent of the Philadelphia public 
schools, supplies a brief introduction, and there is 
a liberal sprinkling of illustrations. 

Dr. John Bascom has drawn, in his 
latest volume " Growth of Nation- 
ality in the United States" (Put- 
nam), from a course of lectures on the Federal 
Constitution, some chapters illustrating the country's 
development under that Constitution out of scattered 
colonies into a compact whole. Traces of prepara- 
tion for the class-room appear everywhere, with 
occasional infelicities of style ; yet the reader can 
easily overlook these, along with a general heavi- 
ness in the treatment, if he is assisted to understand 
such political phenomena as the willingness of John

Jay, a century ago, to give up the unique office of 
Chief Justice of the United States in order to be 
Governor of New York. The tendency to nation- 
ality, in this " social study," is accepted as inher- 
ent, only interrupted by obstacles which it in time 
overcame : diversity in origin of the different colo- 
nies ; distance in miles, in cost and time of com- 
munication, with consequent scanty intercourse and 
diverging interests ; cessation of the need, with the 
conclusion of peace, of union for defense ; rivalry 
of States with one another, of States with the gen- 
eral government, and between departments of gov- 
ernment ; and the social fusion of class and class. 
These obstacles give titles to successive chapters in 
which progress toward union is noted, the steps 
being marked mainly by decisions of the national 
Supreme Court in its slow but effective work of 
establishing a closer Federal Union. It is under 
the last head, " Strife between Classes," that the 
author will be most likely to meet with criticism ; 
his pronounced views on the relation of the State to 
corporations, on railroads and the Inter-State Com- 
merce Commission, on " government by injunction," 
and the income tax, being not only opposed to those 
of many respected fellow-citizens, but chargeable 
also with having no close necessary logical relation 
with the development of his subject. On these 
points, however, he is fair and sincere : while the 
motif of this chapter, " The prosperity of a people 
can no longer be defined in terms of wealth merely, 
or civilization that attaches to classes ; it must be 
defined in terms which express the common social 
welfare, and run through the body of the nation," 
stands quite above criticism. The slavery contro- 
versy fills its due space in the history, its decision 
resting on immutable decree : " The impossibility 
of successfully compromising a moral question lies 
in the fact that Ethical Law is a vital issue, inter- 
lacing all social facts," etc. Not only is this the 
best of lessons for the instruction of a class of 
undergraduates, but it is one which many of the 
nation's legislators might, now no less than fifty 
years ago, be the better for taking to heart. A 
good analytical table of contents and a useful list of 
fifty-six " cases cited " from the Supreme Court 
reports are provided. 

Readable " ^ke Memoirs of the Baroness Cecile 

if apocryphal, de Courtot, Lady in Waiting to the 
memoir,. Princess de Lamballe, Compiled from 

the Letters of the Baroness to Frau von Alvensleben, 
and the Diary of the latter by her great grandson, 
Moritz von Kaisenberg," is the reading of the title 
page of an outwardly attractive book recently trans- 
lated from the German and issued by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. In the preface the editor relates 
how he found one day, at the bottom of an an- 
cient oak chest belonging to the heirlooms of his 
family, a packet of letters tied with the usual blue 
ribbon, and a red velvet album containing a diary 
which proved to be a veritable treasure trove, and 
whose translation from the original French, together 



with editorial matter, furnish the contents of the 
present volume. Briefly told, the contents are as 
follows : The editor gives the Vorgeschichte of the 
von Alvenslebens, an exemplary noble Prussian pair, 
who receive the Emigre'e Baroness de Courtot into 
their family ; the Baroness on several succeeding 
days relates her story up-to-date, which her hostess 
immediately writes down in the words of the nar- 
rator in the red album ; the Baroness resides eight 
years with the von Alvenslebens, the record of which 
is furnished by the album ; she returns to France, 
whence she writes seventeen long letters to' her 
benefactors, which are translated in full. The en- 
tire book gives the impression of unreality. The 
marvellous rescue of the heroine from the guillotine 
'by her lover ; her recognition of Napoleon at their 
first interview as the pale-faced cadet who had once 
rescued her from a mad bull when she was walking 
under the shade of a red parasol in the fields near 
Brienne, and whom she had afterwards crowned with 
a wreath of laurel leaves at the distribution of prizes 
at its Military College ; the return of the supposedly 
dead lover as a famous soldier, all this and much 
more of the same kind bears the appearance of ro- 
mance. There is also a striking similarity of style 
in the parts supplied by the editor, the diary, and 
the letters. If the letters and diary are not genuine, 
the intimate knowledge of millinery and housekeep- 
ing displayed would preclude masculine authorship, 
nor would an author of the male sex people his 
pages with so many sweet friends, dear princesses, 
and dear old uncles and pastors. But however this 
may be, the book is a good one to add to the list 
of light summer reading. 

In its original form, when first pub- 
lislied ten years ago, Captain S. 
Eardley-Wilmot's "Our Fleet To- 
day " was a review in outline of the changes that 
had taken place in the principal fleets of the world 
during the preceding half-century, mainly, of 
course, in the navy of Great Britain. Naval archi- 
tecture develops apace, and maritime nations have 
during the past decade been adding with feverish 
haste to their strength. A new and powerful navy 
has arisen in the East, and America has recently 
startled the world with an unexpected proof of the 
strength and efficiency of her rehabilitated fleet. 
The Chino- Japanese War and the Hispano- American 
War have furnished many subsidiary lessons in 
equipment, structural details, and organization. 
Captain Eardley-Wilmot has therefore seen fit to 
revise and to a considerable extent recast his book, 
with a view of bringing it up to date, and it is now 
re-issued in attractive form with some important 
alterations and additions (Scribners' importation). 
In order to keep the volume within the space limits 
originally assigned to it, the chapters on foreign 
navies are omitted from the new edition, which is 
generally restricted to a history of the development 
of the British fleet from 1840 to the present day, a 
period which includes the radical changes from sail 



oj naval 
architecture.

Professor Smyth's " Greek Melic

catholic in their range. Questions of text criticism, 
the dialects, metrical theory, and the obscure his- 
tory of Greek lyric forms, are treated with copious 
erudition, while literary criticism and illustration 
are not neglected. Professor Smyth would have 
made a more useful book for American teachers if 
he had insisted less rigidly on the scientific distinc- 
tion between melic poetry and lyric poetry in gen- 
eral. We need for the class-room a convenient 
annotated edition of the Teubner Anthologla Lyrica 
including both Iambic and Elegiac poets. Pro- 
fessor Smyth could easily have found room for this 
additional text within his 564 pages by referring 
the student to the histories of Greek literature for 
much of the historical material given in his intro- 
ductions. The proof-reading and printing have 
been done with care. " Ruffian Boreas " is surely 
Shakespeare, not Chaucer. And Rossetti's " Combi-

Nay ! but got it not, for none could get it till now," 
not " for they could not get it till now."

Officers ; Consular Service Duties ; Diplo- 
matic Service ; Uncle Sam and Expansion. The

Canal " (Harper). The book is mainly the fruit of 
personal observation, and is entertainingly written. 
Readers sharing the pretty common, but as we now 
learn mistaken, belief in the insalubrity of Nica- 
ragua, will be surprised to find Mr. Simmons apos- 
trophizing the country as a " land of sunny skies 
and sparkling lakes ; ... of healthful and delight- 
ful climate." " Fevers," he adds, " which in the 
United States are supposed to be the curse of the 
country, are extremely rare, and it would be hard 
to find another land in which so little disease of 
any kind prevails." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" A History of Sanskrit Literature " (Appleton), by 
Dr. Arthur A. MacDonell, has been added to the series 
of " Literatures of the World." It is the first history 
of the subject that has been written in English, a fact 
which gives it a value quite apart from that which re- 
sults from its great intrinsic merit. Heretofore, the 
English reader has had to remain content with Weber's 
volume, nearly half a century old, and with Professor 
Max Miiller's history of the Vedic period. Since the 
writer is a competent scholar in his chosen subject, and 
has made use of the results of the latest scholarship, 
his volume makes a peculiarly acceptable addition to the 
useful series for which it has been written. 

English readers have taken much interest in Russian 
literature of late years, and much has been written 
upon the subject in a fragmentary way. But we have 
had no good modern manual of the subject and are thus 
prepared to welcome, in spite of certain shortcomings 
and defects in perspective, the " History of Russian 
Literature " (Appleton), which has recently been pub- 
lished by Mr. K. Waliszewski. The writer is rather 
French than Russian in his standpoint, which makes his 
book lose something in sympathetic insight, although it 
probably gains in interest of presentation. It appears 
as a volume in the series entitled " Literatures of the 
World."

NOTES. 

" Milton's Minor Poems," edited by Mr. E. S. Parsons, 
is a recent English text published by Messrs. B. H. 
Sanborn & Co. 

"Lawton: An Ode," by Mr. Clinton Scollard, was 
read last June before the Phi Beta Kappa of Harvard, 
and is now printed in a neat pamphlet. 

" To an English Sparrow " is the title of a copy of 
verses, written by Mr. William S. Lord, Evanston, and 
published by him as an artistic booklet. 

Messrs. J. F. Taylor & Co. have in preparation a 
popular edition of the works of Charles Kingsley, from 
the same plates used in their subscription edition of 
this author. 

Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co. announce a unique 
volume claiming Abraham Lincoln as its author. It is 
a scrap-book Lincoln made up for use in the campaign 
of 1858, containing, as he said, everything he had ever 
uttered on the subject of negro equality. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have just sent us three 
modern language texts: Scribe's " Le Verre d'Eau," 
edited by Dr. C. A. Eggert; Bendix's " Nein," edited 
by Mr. A. Werner- Spanhoofd; and Elz's " Er 1st Nicht 
Eifersiichtig," edited by Dr. Benjamin W. Wells. 

North's Plutarch's " Alexander the Great," and 
Ruskin's " Sesame and Lilies," both with introductions 
and other editorial matter furnished by Mr. H. E. 
Scudder, have just been published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. in the " Riverside " series of school texts. 

" A List of Books in the Reading Room " of the John 
Crerar Library, just published by the Directors of that 
institution, makes a dignified pamphlet of two hundred 
and fifty pages, and comprises about three thousand 
volumes, which " may be used by the public without 
any formality." 

The Library of Congress is now issuing a series of 
bulletins of much bibliographical value. Among the 
latest issues are lists relating to Trusts and to the Gov- 
ernment of Dependencies. From the (Copyright Office 
we have an extremely useful compilation of Copyright 
Enactments from 1783 to 1900. 

" Numa Roumestan," translated by Mr. Charles 
DeKay, and " The Little Parish Church," translated by 
Mr. George Burnham Ives, have just been sent us by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. They are uniform with 
the other volumes of Daudet issued by these publish- 
ers, and have attractive frontispieces. 

Messrs. Isaac Pitman & Sons have in press for early 
publication " Pitman's Twentieth Century Dictation 
Book and Legal Forms," being an American commer- 
cial dictation book for schools, without reference to the 
system of shorthand taught. The firm will also issue, 
about September 15, " Robinson Crusoe," in Isaac Pit- 
man's phonography. 

A " Logical Chart for Teaching and Learning the 
French Conjugation," by Mr. Stanislas LeRoy, is a re- 
cent pamphlet publication of Mr. W. R. Jenkins. The 
same publisher sends us two Spanish texts: "Fortuna 
y Otros Cuentos," by Seuor R. Diez de la Cortina; and 
" Temprana y con Sol y Tres Otros Cuentos," by Senora 
Bazan, the latter edited by Senor de la Cortina. 

" The Private Memoirs of Madame Roland," edited 
by Mr. Edward Gilpin Johnson, will shortly be issued by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. The work is based upon 
a translation made from Bosc's original edition of the 



memoirs, published at London within two years after 
Madame Roland's death. It will be the first English 
translation since the above very scarce English edi- 
tion. The volume will contain a number of full-page 
illustrations. 

The University of Illinois has fallen into line with 
many of its fellow institutions by inaugurating a series 
of " University Studies," which will appear at irregular 
intervals. The first number of the series is by Dr. 
D. K. Dodge, and has for its subject " Abraham 
Lincoln : The Evolution of His Literary Style " an 
interesting subject, certainly, and treated with discern- 
ment. 

The science text-books of the late Joel Dormau 
Steele, with their fourteen weeks to each subject, have 
long been the synonym for everything that is pedagog- 
ically and scientifically mischievous, and we doubt the 
desirability of prolonging their life in any shape. But 
it must be admitted that Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd, in 
rewriting the old Steele " Astronomy," has produced a 
book that is both scientific and interesting. This means, 
of course, that she has produced what is practically a 
new work ; and we would have been better pleased had 
she discarded the Steele idea altogether, for that is 
more likely to hurt than to help her book. The volume 
is published by the American Book Co. 

Dr. John Clark Rid path, the well-known American 
historian, died in New York City July 31, at the age of 
fifty-nine. His first book was an " Academic History 
of the United States " (1874-5), from which he abridged 
his " Grammar School History," long a standard text- 
book. From 1869 to 1885 he was a professor in De 
Pauw University. His biographical work included the 
Life and Work of Garfield," the Life and Work of 
James G. Blaine," and the " Life and Times of Glad- 
stone." In 1894 appeared his most comprehensive 
work, entitled " Great Races of Mankind," in four vol- 
umes. He was engaged for ten years in preparing the 
material, and another four years in writing this work. 
He was for a time editor of " The Arena " of Boston. 
His monographs are numerous.

A ROMANCE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 

ROBERT TOURNAY , , w 

By WILLIAM SAGE. Illustrated, 11.50. 

If, as we suppose, " Robert Tournay " be Mr. Sage's first volume, it is certainly a remarkable one. The 
historical background is firmly set, the characters are clearly seen, and the incidents are so deftly interlocked 
that one is borne from one to the other with hardly a pause. . . . This is romance of good quality. 

The Churchman (New York). 

It is an exciting tale of exciting times, and historical scenes are graphically reproduced. ... A decidedly 
readable book. The Living Age (Boston). 

It is occasion for thankfulness that there are such wise, brave, and inspiring books as this Living Age (Boston). 



THE ARTS OF LIFE 

By R. R. BOWKER. 16mo, $1.25. 

Among much studying into science we have neglected the science of our own lives; and with all our learning 
we have failed to learn the art of living. Believing this, and believing also that he who masters life is the happy, 
the successful man, Mr. Bowker has set forth in the seven chapters of this book his thoughts of the seriousness, 
the earnestness, the fidelity with which we should face our opportunities and our responsibilities. Through edu- 
cation, politics, business, and religion he seeks the key of that success which comes from a clear aim, honestly 
followed, ever emphasizing the truth that the reality is more than the symbol. It is a book to be read at leisure 
and thought about afterward not because it says things new and startling, but because it presses home quietly 
truths that make for the improvement of man and society. The Christian Register (Boston).

HERRICK AND DAMON 

COMPOSITION AND RHETORIC FOR SCHOOLS 

By ROBERT HERRICK, A.B., Assistant Professor of English, University of Chicago, and LINDSAY TODD 
DAMON. A.B., Instructor in English, University of Chicago. Published in June, 1899, and has been adopted 
for the High Schools of Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dayton, Ohio; Evansville, Ind.; Rockford, 111.; etc.; and 
for all the High Schools of Kansas, Washington, and Delaware. 

" What has struck me especially is the freshness and directness with which it appeals to the average school-boy and school-girl. It 
attacks the problem of writing as they have to cope with it, talks the plain and vigorous common sense which they are likely to appre- 
ciate, and offers illustrations which are often striking and always directly to the point. It gets at the student in a way most Rhetorics 
fail to do." HKBBEBT VAUGHAN ABBOTT, Department of English, Horace Mann School, New York City.

McCLURE'S FOR SEPTEMBER 



CONTAINS 



Three Chicago Stories 

By EDITH WYATT 



SEPTEMBER McCLURE'S contains three tales which enter an entirely new 
field in fiction and which are sure to attract wide attention. They deal with contem- 
porary Chicago life. The German family of Hoffmans, in this group of stories, the self- 
centred Richard Elliot, and the puritan Miss Alden, all show Miss Wyatt's versatility in 
the delineation of widely diverging types of character. Miss Wyatt, unlike most authors, 
does not defend any one of her characters. On the other hand, not one of them escapes 
her searching satire, and each, at one time or another, is presented in an amusing light. 
A marriage makes possible the dramatic situation which gives rise to the action of the 
stories. They are illustrated in an original way by Frederic R. Gruger, who spent some 
time in Chicago for the purpose.

INVITE SPECIAL ATTENTION TO 

THE BOERS IN WAR 

The True Story of the Burghers in the Field 

By HOWARD C. HILLEGAS, author of " Oom Paul's People." Elaborately illustrated with Photographs by 

the Author and Others. Uniform with "Oom Paul's People." 12mo, cloth, 31 50. 

It will be of peculiar interest to American readers to know that Howard C. Hillegas, author of " Oom Paul's People," 
has been with the Boer commandos in their campaigns, and has secured a wealth of literary and artistic material in the 
shape of manuscript, notes, and photographs, which have been incorporated in his book, "The Boers in War." Mr. 
Hillegas was in Pretoria and on various battlefields at the best times for observations of peculiar interest. The home life 
of Boer families in war time and the actual existence of the burghers in their laagers and intrenchments are vividly 
described. The writer had a personal acquaintance with many of the Boer leaders, and the opportunities which he has 
enjoyed for " telling the other side " the unpublished story of the Boer campaigns are unequaled. and they have been 
fully improved. The book presents a new and oftentimes a most surprising view of the struggle of the Boers. 

AN EPIC OF THE WEST. 

THE GIRL AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE 

A Story of the Plains. By E. HOUGH, author of "The Story of the Cowboy." 12mo, cloth, 81.50. 

" ' The Girl at the Halfway House ' is a book of exceptional vitality, a series of swift-changing, kaleidoscopic pictures 
of one of the most interesting phases of American life a phase which has passed away within the memory, and yet almost 
without the knowledge, of the present generation. It is a broad canvas that Mr. Hough has chosen for his pictures, and 
he draws them in with bold, unfaltering strokes that stand out in clear relief." N. Y. Commercial Advertiser. 

"A writer abundantly endowed with perceptions, a lively sympathy, a sense of humor, and a rich and fluent style. 
His novel is unique in interest and charm. At once an attractive story and an enlightening study of one most picturesque 
phase of the development of America." Chicago Record. 

" Life in the West is pictured in a charming way. Mr. Hough has the faculty of mingling the picturesque and the 
everyday happenings which are wonderfully effective when properly treated." Chicago Evening Post. 

"A novel of brilliant description and intense interest. Mr. Hough has all Stephen Crane's bizarre power of descrip- 
tion with the poetic touch that was never Crane's. . . . No novel of our recent reading has so impressed us, and Mr. 
Hough may justly be moved to a niche of fame very high up in the gallery of American writers of fiction." San 
Francisco Call. 

PINE KNOT 

A Story of Kentucky Life. By WILLIAM E. BARTON, author of " A Hero in Homespun." 

Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"Like Mr. Allen's 'Reign of Law,' 'Pine Knot' is a thoroughly wholesome story written by a man of earnestness 
and purpose. It is a novel to be read and enjoyed and then put away to be read later." Buffalo Express. 

" A most interesting novel. One that will be read in the years after, commented upon, and held as valuable literature 
long after the best society novel has been forgotten." San Francisco Bulletin. 

"A crisp and spirited story. It is a novel which has a permanent value, and the artist has done his work with unusual 
skill. He has given us human portraits and living pictures instead of landscapes and views of the mountains at sunrise or 
sunset." Brooklyn Eagle. 

" The humanity of the book will touch every reader. The quaint peculiarities of the community are introduced with 
picturesque effect, but eccentricities are only appropriate, entertaining accompaniments of a skilfully portrayed develop- 
ment of character and social life. The handling of the love story is satisfying. Few modern writers possess such a power 
of describing an interesting and generally unknown people so appreciatively, graphically, and often humorously. The 
book has a vivid, cumulative interest." The Congregationalist. 

" A story full of interest." New York Nation. 

IN CIRCLING CAMPS 

A Romance of the American Civil War. By J. A. ALTSHELER, author of " A Herald of the West," 
A Soldier of Manhattan," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Mr. Altsheler has written a romance of the Civil War, in which we feel a fresh and captivating genius. It is cer- 
tainly an extraordinary book. Its freshness, vigor, abounding color, keen insight into the life of a volunteer soldier, 
broad, full grasp of military conditions and incidents, and its power of enthusiasm combine to make it a memorable 
romance." N. Y. Independent. 

" A remarkably strong sequence of romantic action carried along at a lively pace by the events of the Civil War. The 
story is admirably sustained. This novel alone is enough to place the art and skill of the writer beyond question." 
Chicago Tribune. 

" A romance full of episode and adventure. The historical background is admirably done. The story of Gettysburg 
is told with graphic pictorial effect. Very good, too, are the occasional glimpses of the melancholy figure of Abraham 
Lincoln." .ZV. Y. Herald. 

"Noteworthy for the breathless interest of its adventures, its broad, generous, and fair-minded view of the people 
and the principles on both sides, and for two remarkably good accounts of great battles." Boston Herald.

A QUESTION OF LITERARY 
CONSCIENCE. 

There are few chapters of literary criticism 
that surpass, in display of subtle insight and 
essential justice of conclusion, the well-known 
essay of Charles Lamb upon the artificial 
comedy of the Restoration. This essay has 
always been a stumbling-block to the Philistine, 
and will always appear paradoxical to the reader 
whose intellectual perceptions do not nicely 
balance his moral prepossessions. Macaulay, 
as we know, found it both a paradox and a 
stumbling-block, and assailed it with the weav- 
er's beam that he wielded with such redoubtable 
energy. But in spite of the attack of Macaulay, 
and of other persons defective in their literary 
sympathies, the ideas advanced by Lamb in 
this essay have held their own, and criticism 
has accepted their fundamental validity. It 
will be remembered that Lamb's argument 
runs, in substance, to the effect that the writers 
whom he defends created a conventional world 
of their own, in which the rules that ordinarily 
govern, and properly should govern, human 
conduct, have no more application than the 
rules of ordinary probability to the incidents 
of a Grim Mahrchen or an Arabian tale. Lamb 
declared himself " glad for a season to take an 
airing beyond the diocese of the strict con- 
science," and now and then " for a dream- 
while or so, to imagine a world with no 
meddling restrictions." The world of Congreve 
and Wycherley " is altogether a speculative 
scene of things, which has no reference what- 
ever to the world that is. ... The whole is a 
passing pageant, where we should sit as uncon- 
cerned at the issues, for life or death, as at a 
battle of the frogs and mice." His complaint is 
that people no longer take delight in the pageant, 
because they have grown too strenuous in their 
literal-minded interpretation of the show. 
" Like Don Quixote, we take part against the 
puppets, and quite as impertinently." We are 
too self-conscious to give ourselves up to mere 
distraction, and go to the theatre not "to escape 
from the pressure of reality so much as to con- 
firm our experience of it ; to make assurance 
double, and take a bond of fate." 

The fashion of the Restoration comedy is 



116 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



one that has now passed away from popular 
interest, but another fashion has taken its 
place, concerning which Lamb's argument is 
equally to the point. This is the fashion of 
romantic fiction, toward which our strenuous 
moralists are apt to assume a deprecatory atti- 
tude, upon much the same grounds that served 
as a basis for the condemnation of the earlier 
fashion. Romantic fiction is essentially unreal, 
we are told ; it does not reflect the conditions 
of actual life, it encourages us to dream instead 
of setting us face to face with the problems of 
human existence, it dissipates our energies in- 
stead of enlisting them in behalf of worthy 
social and intellectual causes. The charge is 
doubtless true, but is there no place for dreams 
in the economy of the spiritual life ? Are we 
to reject the ministry of every form of litera- 
ture that takes us away from our surroundings, 
or is not closely related to our immediate pur- 
suits and interests? Entertainment may not 
be the highest mission of literature, but it is 
surely a legitimate object for a writer to set 
before himself, and those writers who offer 
entertainment, in whatever fashion the hour 
may approve, are not undeserving of the public 
and will not find their efforts unrewarded. To 
say that romantic fiction moves in an unreal 
world of its own making should not be held a 
matter for reproach ; it should rather be recog- 
nized as the necessary condition of this form 
of art, and should make us grateful for the 
refuge which it offers to the mind oppressed 
by the burden, at times so intolerable, of the 
actual world. The art of fiction depends upon 
conventions quite as fully as does the dramatic 
art. The action must be compressed far beyond 
the limits of probability, and worked out with 
small regard for the many disturbing iuflu- 
ences by which it would certainly be compli- 
cated in real life. The villain must be foiled, 
the hero must triumph, and the lovers must be 
united, even if there are only a score of pages in 
which to accomplish all these things. Whatever 
the length of the story, these are its fundamental 
requirements ; and to such ends all the means 
employed by the writer must be bent. Each 
separate scene, moreover, must be heightened 
in effect far beyond anything that is likely to 
occur in everyday life; two people seated side 
by side at a dinner- table must make their con- 
versation more brilliant than any that was ever 
actually heard upon such an occasion ; the 
members of every group of persons brought 
into contact for the purposes of the narrative 
must say and do just the right things at the 



right moments, instead of floundering about in 
act and speech as they doubtless would in the 
haphazard actual world. In that world, as the 
poet reminds us, we get "never the time and 
the place and the loved one all together "; but 
in the world which the romantic imagination 
creates we have a right to expect this conjunc- 
tion, and a reason for justifiable disappointment 
if it is missed. 

The romance of pure adventure appeals to 
some of our healthiest instincts. Both as boys 
and as men, we like to follow the fortunes of 
pirates, to read about shipwrecks and all other 
sorts of forlorn hopes, and to applaud the deeds 
of heroes who slay their enemies right and left, 
and escape from the most desperate dangers by 
feats of improbable prowess and display of 
indomitable if not superhuman valor. The 
gentlest spirits as well as the most fiery delight 
in these things, and delight in them precisely 
because they are so far removed from ordinary 
human experience. They are the happenings 
of a world which, at least when we have out- 
grown boyhood, we have no desire to make our 
own, a world which could not be our own if we 
wished it, a world which we frankly recognize 
as imagined for our diversion. We should ill 
requite those who purvey for us all this inno- 
cent entertainment were we to arraign them 
before the bar of science, to make stern inquiry 
into the probability of their imaginings, and to 
pronounce upon the conduct of their characters 
such severe judgments as would doubtless await 
such conduct in the courts of justice of our 
prosaic world. 

Nevertheless, although we are fully per- 
suaded of the right of romantic fiction to exist 
and of its heroes to perform acts which would 
not bear the test of a prosaic and conventional 
morality, we are not without certain searchings 
of soul when we contemplate the enormous 
vogue enjoyed by this species of literature at 
the present day. Of that vogue there can be 
no question. It would be difficult to point to 
any earlier period in which popular fiction was 
so largely made up of tales of adventure, tales 
whose interest centres upon exploits rather than 
principles, upon the triumph of the individual 
will rather than of the abstract ideal. There 
is an appalling amount of bloodshed in our 
popular romance, and an almost unexampled 
degree of recklessness in the choice of means 
for the desired end. One need not be a pro- 
fessional moralist to correlate this illustration 
of popular taste with the wave of brutality 
which seems to be sweeping over our civiliza-

tion, and which threatens to submerge the 
moral territory that has been reclaimed at so 
great a cost of individual and collective effort. 
For some reason or other, the finer instincts of 
civilization seem of late years to have become 
dulled, and both individuals and nations are 
suffered without effective protest to commit 
acts which should arouse the fiercest indignation 
for their contravention of all the principles by 
which nations achieve true greatness and indi- 
viduals bequeath to their descendants a heri- 
tage of honorable fame. We should hardly 
include our popular literature among the active 
causes of this degenerative process, but it may 
not be unfair to regard it as symptomatic. We 
may read with zest the popular literature which 
glories in brute force, and we may get no harm 
from it as individuals ; but we must " view 
with alarm," as the political platforms say, the 
ever-increasing hold which this species of lit- 
erature is gaining upon the popular mind. If 
such literature does not directly shape the ac- 
tions of men, it certainly does to some extent 
reflect their ideals, and its present prominence 
is such as to confront the literary conscience 
with a serious question. Should we, because 
they afford us such admirable entertainment, 
give our unqualified approval to these writings 
that glorify all the brutal passions, that move 
in a world unswayed by the moral law, and 
that substitute for the Christian precepts a 
gospel whereof Carlyle and Nietzsche are the 
evangelists ? It is a serious question, whether 
the ideals of public and private morality, as 
reflected in the popular literature of the day, 
which this century is about to pass on to the 
next, will bear a favorable comparison with 
those which the last century bequeathed to 



our own. 



"LA FORZA D'UN BEL VOLTO." 

(After Michael Angela.) 



Skyward I 'm drawn by light of thy fair face 
(Other delight on earth is left me none), 
And of the spirits elect I count me one: 

Was ever granted mortal man such grace ? 

So well the Maker in thy form I trace 
That, seeing Him, already earth I shun: 
And well for me, else were I all undone, 

Such flame for thee doth heart and mind enlace. 

Wherefore, if never my fixed gaze I turn 

From thy deep eyes, 't is that my bleeding feet 

Learn from their blessed light the path divine; 
And if in happy martyrdom I burn, 

'T is that the generous fire showeth sweet 
The joys that in the eternal heaven shine.

A GREAT AMERICAN POLITICIAN.* 

Few Americans better deserve the appella- 
tion of " great politician " than William H. 
Seward. Born in 1801, he was already a party 
leader in his county at the early age of 23, and 
he continued active or interested in politics 
until his final retirement forty- five years after- 
wards at the age of 69. For much more than 
half of this period he was in public office. He 
was State Senator, 1829-1833 ; Governor of 
his State, 1839-1843 ; United States Senator, 
1849-1861 ; and Secretary of State, 186}- 
1869, making in all twenty-eight years of 
official life. Moreover, during seventeen 
years of the forty-five years that he was out 
of office he was not out of politics, for, as his 
present biographer remarks, speaking of the 
period following his retirement from the State 
Senate, " he always had time for profitable 
politics, and he knew how to plan." He some- 
times wearied of political conflicts and party 
strife ; he sometimes spoke of his principal 
employment for so many years in the tone of 
disgust, painting at the same time " a fond 
picture of retirement his otium cum digni- 
tate oceans of leisure in midst of shrubs and 
flowers, as he jocosely translated it "; but there 
is less of this self-deluding sentiment in his 
biography than is to be found in the biographies 
of most public men of equal eminence. When 
he retired from the State Senate in 1833 and 
returned to the " much-coveted quiet of his study 
and profession," he wrote to his friend Weed 
rejoicing that he was " free from the wearying 
and * unprofitable life ' that he had been living 
at Albany, and hoped that he was at home to 
remain for a long time "; but he significantly 
added : " Keep me informed upon political 
matters, and take care that you do not so far 
get absorbed in professional occupations that 
you will cease to care for me as a politician." 
When a politician calls in his next friend in 
such fashion as this, he is not very likely to 
need his assistance. " The world knows," says 
our author, in relating this incident, " what the 
politician means when he says farewell." 
Seward spoke his true nature when, at the same 
perfod of his life, he wrote : 

" I shall, from the force of constitutional bias, be 
found always mingling in the controversies which agi- 
tate the country. Enthusiasm for the right and ambi-

tion for personal distinction are passions of which I 
cannot divest myself, and while every day's experience 
is teaching me that the former is the very agent which 
must defeat the latter, I am far from believing that I 
should be most happy were I to withdraw altogether 
from political action." 

The following addendum reveals that even 
then he was an adept in the genial optimistic 
philosophy which he so freely dispensed to 
others and employed so soothingly in his own 
case in after life. 

"I shall go on as always, adopting what my judg- 
ment and my conscience approve. If my career ends 
where it now is, I shall have enjoyed, if not all I de- 
served, as much of success as is my reasonable share. 
If success comes as it hitherto has done, when I am 
laboring in what seems to me the right cause, it will be 
doubly gratifying, because it will bring no remorse." 

The fact is, William H. Seward's mind and 
temper were thoroughly political, and he could 
no more keep out of politics than a fish can 
keep out of water. 

The character of Mr. Seward's life naturally 
determines the character of Mr. Bancroft's 
book. Seward was, indeed, much more than 
a politician. Ho was a man of large mental 
and social cultivation ; he delighted in nature 
and travel, and actually travelled far more than 
most of his compeers in public life ; he was a 
lawyer, and rose to a high place, although not 
to the highest place, in his profession. More- 
over, some of the author's most pleasing chap- 
ters deal with these interesting topics, such as 
" Travels," " Seward as a Lawyer," " Some 
Personal Traits and Characteristics," the " Man 
and Senator "; but such themes altogether, 
including the first years and last years of life, 
fill fewer than 100 of the 1225 pages that 
make up the two volumes. The work is em- 
phatically a political biography. Still, we do 
not wish to imply that Seward was not states- 
man as well as politician. 

With all his tact and arts of conciliation, 
traits in which he greatly excelled, Mr. Seward 
sharply divided men in opinion while he was 
living ; and it is inevitable that any writer who 
deals with his history, if he attempts more than 
a bald sketch, will divide his readers now that 
Seward has long been dead. 

First, there is the selection from the mass of 
material of such matter as will, when properly 
presented, give a full and fair view of Seward's 
life and character. Here we think Mr. Ban- 
croft is deserving of commendation. He has 
studied his subject with evident thoroughness, 
and has shown good judgment in the selection 
of his matter. Mr. Seward's entry into public 
life was coincident with the sound and fury 



that made up political anti-masonry ; he iden- 
tified himself with the Whig party at its form- 
ation, and continued, not merely a Whig, but 
a prominent Whig leader, until the dissolution 
of the party ; he cast in his lot with the Re- 
publicans soon after the organization of that 
party, rose to the highest place in its councils 
but one, and, although he became widely sepa- 
rated from many of his old colleagues after the 
Civil War, he still favored the Republican 
Presidential candidates in 1868 and 1872. 
Here is a great variety of topics of the highest 
interest, and Mr. Bancroft has so handled them 
as to make perfectly clear what they are in 
themselves and what were Mr. Seward's rela- 
tions to them. While we should have been 
pleased to see a little better sense of proportion 
in some parts of the work, we do not feel that we 
have serious cause for complaint. Our severest 
criticism would be that the last years of 
Seward's official life have been passed over too 
hurriedly. Some events of Johnson's adminis- 
tration, as his quarrel with Grant, may be re- 
ferred to. It will be remembered that in the 
celebrated issue of " veracity " between the 
President and the General, Seward, in a way, 
endorsed his chief ; but the incident is not 
mentioned in these pages. 

But, secondly, the crucial test comes on the 
question of interpretation : what do the facts 
mean ? Mr. Bancroft has been severely criti- 
cised for both the amount and the character of 
the commentary that he has incorporated in his 
history. He is continually interpolating, it is 
charged, unnecessary and unjust explanations 
of Seward's utterances and acts, particularly in 
the first volume, which closed with the Presi- 
dential election of 1860. We have not space 
to deal with this subject directly, farther than 
to observe that this volume does not, on the 
whole, leave on the mind a favorable impres- 
sion of Mr. Seward as a politician, but rather 
distinctly the contrary. 

Indirectly, however, we wish to say that 
Mr. Seward constantly challenges discussion 
and provokes commentary. He was not a 
man of simple but rather of complex mental 
character ; few of our eminent statesmen have 
been more so ; he is constantly arousing the 
activity of the harmonist or of the critic ; and 
the biographer who should confine himself to 
the plain story, abjuring all attempts at inter- 
pretation, would show a rare power of self- 
abnegation. The principal questions are not 
only historically interesting but they are deeply 
rooted in the character of the man. What did

Seward really mean by the " higher law," the 
" irrepressible conflict," the peace-in-sixty-days 
prophecies, and by his proposal to Mr. Lincoln 
in the month of April, 1861, that war at home 
should be averted, or an attempt be made to 
avert it, by wantonly getting up war abroad ? 
The biographer, especially if psychologically 
inclined, feels bound to make answer to these 
questions ; but to make answer is to provoke 
disagreement. In complexity of character, 
Mr. Seward reminds us of Jefferson, of whom 
one of the best known of American historians 
says that he cannot be sketched in outline, but 
must be painted " stroke by stroke." We do 
not undertake to propound theories relative to 
these interesting questions ; but for us, how- 
ever it may be with others, Mr. Bancroft states 
the substance of truth when he says that 
William H. Seward was two men in one, John 
Quincy Adams and Thurlow Weed " not less 
eager to inherit the mantle of the one than to be 
the beneficiary of the schemes and power of the 
other," but equally sincere in both cases. Our 
author says, dealing with the Senatorial period : 
" Seward continued to hear the two voices in fact, 
he continued to act two distinct roles. It was John 
Quincy Adams Seward that uttered the telling phrases 
and made the severe arraignments and was the hope of 
the radicals like Gerrit Smith, Theodore Parker, and, 
at times, of the Garrisonians. He usually favored 
what was boldest and most extreme if it stopped short 
of violence. On the other hand, Thurlow Weed Seward 
kept in close relations with the party organization; he 
watched the plans of the politicians, changed the pro- 
gramme to suit conditions, and tried to win all classes 
of men. Adams Seward was ardently anti-slavery and 
expected to live in history as a great philanthropist. 
Weed Seward was determined to control the patronage 
and to live in the White House. The one regarded 
himself as a martyr to a sacred cause, and wrote: 'I 
am alone, in the Senate and in Congress, and about in 
the United States, alone. While adhering faithfully to 
the Whigs, I dare to hold on the disallowed right of 
disenfranchised men and classes. I must stand in that 
solitude and maintain it, or fall altogether.' The other 
was alone in deciding which principles and theories 
should be given prominence and which should be ig- 
nored or explained away. The result was that Seward 
continued to be the political favorite of a large propor- 
tion of the champions of freedom and of ardent youth- 
ful voters of the best impulses, as well as of the prac- 
tical men and hard-headed politicians, calculating on 
tendencies and eager for office." 

The meaning of all this is that Mr. Seward 
was a thorough-going opportunist, but certainly 
not an opportunist of the baser sort. That he 
often saw far into the future, and with perfect 
clearness, is true beyond question ; but then 
again, politician that he was, he sometimes 
showed himself wholly blind to impending po- 
litical changes of the most important character. 



For one thing, he was slow to believe in the 
disruption of existing parties and the formation 
of new ones. At first he inclined to the Demo- 
cratic-Republican party that Jefferson had 
founded, to which his father was firmly at- 
tached ; but it was as impossible for him to 
act with that party, in the long run, as it was 
for him not to be a politician at all. He was 
impelled toward the other school of political 
thought by his mental character, as well as by 
his dislike of the Albany Regency ; so that it 
was predetermined, as far as such things are 
predetermined, that he should be first a Whig 
and then a Republican. But first he toyed 
with the Anti-Masonic party. Young as he 
was in those days, Seward could hardly have 
had any faith in this movement as Anti-Ma- 
sonry, and must have been drawn to it, or 
driven to it, as the only effectual or practical 
way of opposing the party then in power, and 
of promoting certain objects in which he was 
interested that had become associated with the 
Anti-Masonic movement. But with the Whigs, 
and later the Republicans, with their large 
national views, he was in his element. 

Reverting to Seward's partial defect in po- 
litical prevision, one is surprised to find him 
writing to Charles Sumner after the crushing 
defeat of the Whigs in 1852, when many lead- 
ing men considered the defeat annihilation : 

" I answer that just now there is nothing to say, only 
that recent events are what they were or might have 
been foreseen, and that they do not disturb me in the 
least. No new party will arise, nor will any old one fall. 
The issue will not change. We shall go on much as 
heretofore, I think, only that the last effort to convert 
the Whig party to slavery has failed." 

Two years after this, the New York " Times," 
which reflected the sentiments of Seward and 
Weed, repeatedly predicted both Seward's 
nomination as a Whig candidate for the Presi- 
dency, and his election, in 1856. Seward did 
not look for the dissolution of the Whig party. 
Naturally, therefore, he took no part in the 
efforts made in 1854 to organize the Anti- 
Slavery forces of the country efforts that led 
to the formation of the Republican party, of 
which he was proud a little later to be the 
great leader but rather discouraged them. 
Naturally, too, Greeley wrote in "The Trib- 
une," when the New York election was over : 
" Instead, however, of taking the position which cir- 
cumstances and his own antecedents seemed to require, 
Mr. Seward, adhering to the vacated shell of Whiggery, 
has stood aside and allowed the great movement of the 
Free States to go forward without a word of bold and 
hearty encouragement from its natural leader. The 
result is recorded in the returns of this election."

But Mr. Seward had a personal reason for 
going slowly at this time. His senatorial term 
would expire in 1855, and he did not wish to 
fall between stools. Here was more oppor- 
tunism. What is more, the hesitancy and in- 
decision which marks men of speculative mind, 
when the time comes for action, was no doubt 
a factor in the problem, as it was in many 
other problems in Mr. Seward's life. No 
doubt, too, such hesitancy or indecision is a 
part of opportunism. It is natural that a poli- 
tician should be slow to believe that a great 
party that he has served and loved, and to 
which he is looking for favors, should be mori- 
bund ; but Seward should have seen, at least 
after 1852, that such was the state of the 
Whigs. 

Still, it was in those very days, perhaps, that 
Seward rendered his country the greatest ser- 
vice. This he did in the early, powerful, and 
constant testimony that he bore against Slavery. 
Of politicians of high rank, he was the first to 
discern the true nature of the peculiar institu- 
tion, to see where it was bearing the country, 
to oppose it stoutly on high moral and political 
grounds, and to foretell what the end would be 
freedom victorious over slavery. Witness 
his speech to the Whigs of the Western Re- 
serve, made at Cleveland in 1848. To be sure, 
there was much in his life that was inconsistent 
with his lofty avowal of principle ; but, poli- 
tician as he was, he did not believe that the 
ends which he sought could be gained without 
the aid of a powerful political party, and so he 
clung to the Whigs even when it is hard to see 
how any man of his clearness of vision could 
discover any real soundness in the party. 

With his defeat at Chicago in I860, Mr. 
Seward seems definitively to have abandoned 
his presidential ambition ; and with such aban- 
donment, his political life, Mr. Bancroft holds, 
ascended to a higher level. He accounts him the 
greatest of American Secretaries of State, and 
believes that the estimation in which his great 
services in that office are held by the American 
people will increase rather than diminish as 
the years go by. A man of generous feeling, 
who agrees in the main with Seward's political 
ideas, can hardly fail to sympathize with him 
in the great disappointment of his life ; but 
when we recall Seward's opportunism, and 
especially the manifestations of his opportun- 
ism in the period between the election of Mr. 
Xiincoln and the conclusive joining of the issue 
in the succeeding year reflecting upon the 
uncertainty of the result, if it had been left in 



Seward's hands one can hardly fail to see 
that the country had a fortunate escape from 
probable if not certain peril when the nomina- 
tion went to the comparatively unknown can- 
didate from Illinois. 

It remains only to add that Mr. Bancroft 
has made a valuable contribution to a very im- 
portant part of our political history.

NATURE BY Dowx AND PAVE.* 



In Mr. W. H. Hudson's large and handsome 
volume entitled " Nature in Downland," the 
term " Downland " is applied to the range of 
low treeless hills popularly known as the South 
Downs, which run parallel with the line of the 
sea-coast in the county of Sussex, England. 
The hills are of chalk formation, with soft 
rounded outlines and fluted sides, and are cov- 
ered with a thick fine turf which affords the 
best of pasturage for the famous breed of sheep 
bearing the name of the hills on which they 
feed. 

To the average mind, these bare and monoto- 
nous elevations, as they are delineated by the 
author, and by the artist who assists him, are 
not particularly prepossessing ; yet upon Mr. 
Hudson they exercised a fascination so absorb- 
ing and persistent that for weeks and months 
of the year 1899 he was rambling over them, a 
solitary but diligent student of their varying 
aspects and productions. Neither the heats of 
midsummer nor the storm and gloom of winter 
had force to lessen his enthusiasm. In storm 
or shine, in August or December, he was 
pleased to be out in the open alone, quietly 
noting the changes in earth and sky and in the 
wild life that came under his observation. 

It was a singular choice of pastime or indus- 
try, judged by ordinary standards, but to him 
the returns were ample in satisfaction. Clad 
in a suit of grayish-brown tweeds, of the tint 
and texture best adapted to the purpose of the 
field naturalist that of approaching unnoticed 
the bird or beast his eye was fixed on, he 
prolonged his daily tramp for ten or twelve 
hours together. For food when hungry and for 
shelter at nightfall, he depended upon the hos- 
pitality of the cottagers whose humble habita-

tions are found at long intervals in the desert- 
like region. 

He carried no weapon of offense or defense, 
his intent being kindly toward every living 
creature, but he was never without one invari- 
able companion, a powerful binocular, of all 
man's inventions that which to him " was the 
most like a divine gift." Nothing was too small 
or too mean to engage his attention with the 
help of this valuable aid to the vision. For 
hours he could gaze on the thistle-down filling 
the air, and he made it the subject of pages of 
reminiscent and original comment. The plants 
underfoot, the insects in the air, " the little 
winged men and women called birds," the ani- 
mals clothed in scales or in fur, the clouds in 
the sky, all that is included in Nature, was the 
subject of his careful and minute consideration. 
He had the fine instinct which enables one to 
discern the beauty inherent in everything, " the 
beauty and grace and sweetness and melody " 
that exist everywhere. It was this that made 
" every hour of the day and every step of the 
way," during his months of solitary sauntering 
on the South Downs, a keen and pure delight 
such as the world dreams not of. 

Mr. Hudson has heretofore made valuable 
contributions to the facts of natural history. 
His youth was spent on the plains of the Argen- 
tine Republic, and at this early period of life 
he developed a talent for searching and accu- 
rate inquiry into the secrets of the wild life 
about him, and an equal ability for reporting 
the discoveries that resulted. During his later 
sojourn in England he has continued in the 
same line of study, and his work has a value 
justly esteemed by the fellows of his craft. 
The present volume is a comprehensive survey 
of the structure, the surface, the specialties of 
the pastoral region of Sussex, not excluding its 
human characteristics. The narrative is in 
harmony with the subject, serene and unevent- 
ful. A series of expressive illustrations accom- 
pany the letter-press. 

Mr. Charles M. Skinner has made his mark 
as a clever writer, always spirited and amusing, 
and at times brilliant. His name attached to 
a volume is therefore a definite recommenda- 
tion. In the one now before us, "Flowers in 
the Pave," he has brought together eleven short 
sketches, most of which relate to his experi- 
ences in contact with Nature. It is from the 
point of view of a nature-lover that he chiefly 
discourses, and many a bright, poetical, tender, 
and pathetic thing does he say to us in this 
amiable character. 



It is a happy temperament which Mr. Skinner 
possesses, the aesthetic temperament with its gift 
for seeing the pictures and hearing the music 
of the universe. He is aware of these moving 
sights and sounds in the city streets, the back 
yards, the alleys even, and they appeal to him 
with persuasive joy by night as by day. Such 
spirits among us have a mission to fulfil. It 
is to awaken others to a sense of the delights 
which are common to all, which are as cheap 
as the daylight, and as much at our command 
as the air we breathe. Mr. Skinner appreciates 
the obligation which his gift Jays upon him, 
and faithfully endeavors to communicate his 
pleasure in the beauty with which Nature sur- 
rounds us even in the densest cities' confines. 
In a characteristic passage, he says : 

" There is always the sky; the stars are lighted after 
dark; some yards boast a spear or two of grass; dis- 
tance will not be cheated of its magic, nor wholly shut 
off by buildings; there is even a tree uow and again; 
and birds, dogs, cats, and children bring a touch of free 
life to the scene. . . . Some of the best hours in a 
man's life are those when he is beholden to nothing and 
nobody, when he simply looks at the sky or the woods 
or the hills, or from his window gazes into tree-tops, 
clean and rare delight." 

The foregoing passage is taken from the 
first and longest piece in the book. Next to 
this in our favor is the final essay, which is a 
grateful exposition of " The Kindness of Na- 
ture." We hear so much uow-a-days of the 
cruelty of our earth-mother that a testimony to 
her loving intent toward her children comes 
with peculiar graciousness. We make room 
for a bit of this to show the force of the au- 
thor's argument : 

" For one who is crushed beneath a falling tree are 
there not a hundred thousand who eat its fruit, who re- 
joice in its shade, who breathe a purified air about it, 
who bask in its heat when it gives back its store of 
sunshine in our fireplace on a winter night? For one 
who succeeds in filling himself with malaria, through 
careless living, think how many find only health and 
beauty and food and business in the fields. ... In the- 
perfect order of Nature we read a kindness that is- 
deeper than our ability to adjust ourselves to it. Man. 
is more abusive than the earth. He slays for gain, he 
slays for sport, he fells the woods, he blasts the hills, 
he dries the streams, he mars loveliness, he lives un- 
beautifully, until he gets intelligence and sees that the 
rest of creation thrives by opposite conduct, when he 
begins to act with modesty and to harmonize his actions, 
to those of the rest of the world." 

Mr. Skinner is an optimist as well as a na- 
ture-lover, and preaches his glad gospel at 
every proper opening. It is enlivening to hear 
him say : 

" I believe that the human type is bettering all the 
time, in spite of the people one meets in city slums and 



122

[Sept 1, 



other unexcellent places, where they seem to be sinking 
back from the standard." 

And again : 

" Do away with occasion for gloom. It is well with 
the rest of the world, so, why not with us? Let 's be 
glad we were born, instead of sorry that other folks 
were. The hospitable state of mind is best, because it 
is most like nature." 

We will make one more extract, because of 
its pungent suggestion ; 

" In my days of solitude in the fields the city weight 
falls off and I spring erect like a pine released after 
long bending. I live. I find myself. God forgive me 
for selling so much of my life for wages." 

It is a sane and wholesome soul that can 
speak like this. Mr. Skinner reveres his in- 
stincts, and cherishes them ; therefore it is 
that amidst the cark and care that business in 
a city inevitably imposes, there is still much 
saving " music and song " in his daily life. 

After the examples we have given of the 
dash and humor and charm in Mr. Skinner's 
essays, we are forced to express the conviction 
that he could do much better if he desired, and 
that we ought really to demand a higher order 
of writing from a man with his pronounced 
and versatile talents. It is easy to imagine the 
finished work he might produce with delibera- 
tion and care and with the righteous ambition 
which should be a part of the equipment of 
every writer who asks the ear of the public.

THE ROMANTIC HISTORY OP TEXAS.* 



There is, perhaps, no State in the Union 
which possesses so individual, so striking, so 
picturesque a past as Texas. Six different 
sovereignties have in turn claimed her alle- 
giance. Discovered and traversed by the ad- 
venturous Spaniards in the sixteenth century, 
no contestant appeared until La Salle, the ex- 
plorer of the Mississippi, landed by mischance 
on the shores of the Espiritu Santo, in 1685, 
where he planted his short-lived colony. Then 
began the dispute over the possession of the 
territory, which ended only with the Mexican 
War. The coming of the French caused the 
Spaniards to occupy the country, their first 
establishment dating from 1690, many years 
before the hardy pioneers of the Atlantic States 
had crept past the barrier of the Alleghanies. 
More than a hundred years elapsed ere the 

*A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF TEXAS. Edited by 
Dudley Q. Wooten. In two volumes. Dallas, Texas : Pub- 
lished by William G. Scarff. 



Anglo-Americans, owning the sovereignty of 
Mexico, entered that region as colonists. The 
time was short, however, after their coming 
until the province was in a state of insurrec- 
tion ; an insurrection which led to war and 
independence. The republic which was set up, 
after a decade, became a member of the Union ; 
but when the great rupture of the States came, 
Texas cast her lot with the South. Since that 
time she has made wonderful progress both in 
material development and in the wider influ- 
ence exerted on national affairs. 

From this bare outline it must be perceived 
that the field of Texas history is broad and 
inviting. It is therefore with pleasure that we 
note the recent issue of what the publisher well 
pronounces an Encyclopedia of Texas History. 
The text is made up in the first part of Yoa- 
kuni's " History of Texas " with some " sup- 
plemental " chapters ; in the second, of " a 
complete history of the State of Texas from 
1845 to 1897 "; and in the third, of a series of 
articles covering such topics as the " Indian 
Tribes of Texas," etc. The republication of 
Yoakum's History, of which only a limited edi- 
tion ever appeared (1855), is an important 
feature of the work. So far as the student of 
history is concerned, however, much of the 
value of this republication is lost in the failure 
to reprint the notes and citations of the orig- 
inal author. To aggravate this, new notes are 
occasionally added by F. W. Johnson, from his 
MS. History of Texas, which frequently take 
Yoakum to task without indicating any other 
authority than Mr. Johnson. This is always 
unfortunate, for the student has no clue whereby 
he may continue the search in the endeavor to 
arrive at the truth. 

The sixteenth century, during which time 
Grijalva, Pineda, Cabeza de Vaca, Guzman, 
Coronado, and others, explored parts of the 
State, receives only passing notice in this work. 
The history proper begins with the landing of 
La Salle on the coast of the Espiritu Santo in 
February, 1685. Sieur de La Salle sailed to 
plant a colony on the Mississippi, then known 
as Rio del Espiritu Santo ; but failing in his 
calculations, he entered a bay on the coast of 
Texas, since known as Matagorda. La Salle 
was slain, and the colony came to an end a few 
months after through Indian attacks and inter- 
nal dissensions. But the Spaniards in Mexico 
had heard of the expedition, and soon a small 
army was on the soil of Texas. Precarious 
settlements were made as the Spaniards became 
alarmed for the safety of their sovereign's do-

minions. The State and Church marched hand 
in hand in forming missions : the territory 
would be preserved and the Indians converted. 
The mission-founding began in 1690, and con- 
tinued irregularly for almost a century. Nine- 
teen distinct establishments were made in the 
territory known as Texas. This most unique 
and interesting epoch the Mission period 
has received too little attention. When we 
consider that this regime lasted until the com- 
ing of the American colonists, and that it 
affected in no small measure the social, political, 
and economic development of the State, it must 
become apparent that the subject is worthy of 
more extended treatment than that which Yoa- 
kum gave it fifty years ago. 

The period of American colonization began 
with Moses Austin, who went to Mexico in 
1820, during the troublous times of the revo- 
lution, and secured a grant of land lying in the 
rich valley of the Colorado river. This colony 
became the nucleus of the present State, which 
now ranks seventh in population in the Union. 
The Austin MSS., printed in articles contrib- 
uted by Guy M. Bryan, throw much light on 
the development of the colonies which were 
rapidly filled with emigrants from the " over- 
crowded " States. 

The result of the occupation of Texas might 
have been forecast. Two peoples, with such 
distinct customs and ideas as the Americans 
and their Mexican rulers, could not hope to 
dwell in peace. By the year 1835 contentions 
and usurpations led to insurrection and war ; 
1836 found Santa Anna, the despot of Mexico, 
in the hands of the Texans as a result of the 
great victory of San Jacinto. In March of 
that year independence was declared. Such a 
state of affairs had been brought about, not by 
the slavery party of the South, as many anti- 
slavery writers have indicated, but chiefly by 
the original colonists, who fought for their 
rights in the first place with no idea of imme- 
diate freedom. This is clearly established by 
documentary evidence which must be consid- 
ered by future students of the question of 
slavery. However, there remains much to be 
done in the way of writing the complete history 
of the sharp and bloody revolution which gave 
Texas her independence. The Mexican version 
of the matter, with the political history of the 
colonies during the conflict and through the 
period of independent existence, offer tempting 
inducements to the investigator. 

At the time of the revolution, Texas was 
inhabited by about 30,000 Anglo-Americans, 



5,000 slaves, 3,000 Mexicans, and 14,000 In- 
dians. During the period of the Republic, 
which lasted from 1836 to 1845, the popula- 
tion grew at a tremendous rate. The story of 
the annexation is well told in these volumes, 
in an essay by General Sam Bell Maxey. The 
struggle in the State itself is contrasted with 
the larger controversy which was precipitated 
in the Union over the question of the annexa- 
tion. The full import of the accession of 
Texas on the politics of the time, on the slavery 
agitation, on the aggressive spirit of the nation, 
is not brought out satisfactorily. Indeed, thus 
far the subject of the Mexican War has received 
no adequate or competent treatment. The 
causes which gave rise to it were not all of 
recent growth ; some of them dated from the 
Louisiana Purchase, some earlier, some later. 
The immediate cause of the Mexican War 
the annexation of Texas has been allowed 
to obscure all others. The Mexican govern- 
ment, at that time rent by faction and revo- 
lution, inherited the odium which had been 
originally Spain's and suffered in conse- 
quence. In another sense, the Mexican War 
was a manifestation of the predatory tendencies 
of the Anglo-Saxon race. 

From the Mexican War to 1895 the history 
is narrated by ex-Governor Oran M. Roberts, 
recently deceased. It is a concise, praiseworthy 
discussion, which, however, deals primarily 
with political aspects. The history of the 
growth of parties in the State is not so well 
told elsewhere. Naturally, having played a 
part in the proceedings himself, some allow- 
ance must occasionally be made for the per- 
sonal element. The exciting years which pre- 
ceded the Civil War are well presented. The 
division of the people over the question of 
secession is notable ; the contest was bitterly 
waged, but, once committed to a policy, the 
State stood manfully by its position. 

The more recent events, as well as many of 
the essays, have interest only for those vitally 
concerned with the history of the State. How- 
ever, some of the special articles are noteworthy 
contributions to the history of the Southwest. 
Examples are " The Fredonian War," "Official 
Documents, Laws, Decrees, and Regulations 
Pertaining to Austin's Colonies," " The Indian 
Tribes of Texas," " Spanish and Mexican Titles 
to Land in Texas, their Origin and History, 
1691-1835." The last contribution, "The 
Results of Fifty Years of Progress in Texas," 
is a fitting close to the history. 

The arrangement of the materials might

have been varied a little with profit ; but lack 
of unity, from the nature of the case, could 
not have been avoided. The failure to cite, 
from page to page, the authorities and sources 
drawn upon, detracts much from the worth of 
the History. It must be said, too, that a few 
of the contributions are hardly more than 
memoirs but memoirs of much import. An 
ample index adds much to the convenience of 
the reader. The two thousand pages of the 
two volumes, with their three hundred and 
sixty-four illustrations, exhibit a neatness and 
finish which would do credit to any publishing 
house. In fine, the work as a whole marks 
an epoch in the making of Texas history.

RECENT FICTION.* 

When Mr. Robert Herrick published " The Gos- 
pel of Freedom," a year or two ago, he gave evidence 
of a degree of constructive skill and artistic sincerity 
that augured well for whatever future work he 
might produce. Up to that time his work had been 
tentative and confined within narrow limits ; he had 
undertaken nothing of really ambitious design. But 
"The Gospel of Freedom" at once gave him an 
assured place among our serious novelists, and sug- 
gested even finer powers than it exhibited. Of his 
new novel, " The Web of Life," we are not justified 
in faying that it exhibits an advance upon the earlier 
work, but it is safe to say that there has been no 
retrogression. It is a strongly conceived domestic 
story, filled with earnestness and fine idealism. 
Possibly the idealism is somewhat too impatient, 
and the earnestness too unrelieved by those lighter 
touches that writers of more experience, however 
serious their ultimate purpose, usually contrive to 
add ; but these defects if such they be do not

weigh very much against the admirable accomplish- 
ment of the book. The hero is a young man of 
fine impulses set in the midst of a sordid society, 
and revolting with his whole soul against the gross 
and selfish ideals that surround him on every hand. 
His revolt is so extreme that he casts aside what are 
commonly considered " opportunities " for advance- 
ment, and goes so far as to defy all the conventions 
by living without the customary legal sanctions in 
company with the woman whom he loves. The 
story of his struggle for a living under these condi- 
tions, and of the heroic act by which the woman, at 
last grown conscious that she is ruining his career, 
sacrifices her own life to set him free, is told with 
directness and simple pathos. He has learned at 
last how hard it is to kick against the pricks, and is 
ready to take up the life of external conformity 
without any abandonment of internal principle. 
The scene is laid in Chicago, concerning which com- 
munity the writer finds occasion to utter many 
truths unpalatable to its inhabitants. That they 
are truths is undeniable to any disinterested ob- 
server ; perhaps it is fair to say that they are not 
sufliciently relieved by other truths of the more 
agreeable sort. Somehow the book leaves the impres- 
sion of a society in which there is no such thing as 
purity of motive or elevation of soul ; it is, as we 
said before, the book of an impatient idealist, of a 
writer whose indignation has got the better of his 
sympathies. We expect that Mr. Herrick will fall 
into a mellower vein after a time, and thereby gain 
a wider influence than he can expect to exert through 
a book like " The Web of Life," with all its serious 
sincerity of purpose. 

"The Prelude and the Play," by Mr. Rufus 
Mann, is a novel that may be coupled with the one 
just now under discussion, although it is far inferior 
in execution. The style is pretentious and affected ; 
the elaboration of motive and analysis is greatly 
overdone. This novel also has its scene in Chicago 
at least in large part and it also presents the 
contrast although not so sharply between the

ideal plane of life and the lower material plane. 
" These men here would n't be half bad if they 
could only forget their principles," is a remark made 
by one of the characters, and we feel like applying 
it to the author himself. He is so intent upon prin- 
ciples that he altogether fails to give us character- 
ization, and there is not a figure in his book that 
seems really alive. A pretty enough sentiment 
takes the place of passion, and the characters are 
moved about like pawns on a chessboard ; we never 
feel that they are moving themselves. We should 
add that it is dangerous to use French and Italian 
words without knowing the languages. An Italian 
who said " non, signora " would be a curiosity, a 
woman cannot be epris, and there is no such mon- 
ster as a bete noir known to syntax. 

It is a far cry from " The Confessions of a Frivo- 
lous Girl," a youthful indiscretion which Mr. Robert 
Grant now doubtless wishes were forgotten, to 
" Unleavened Bread," his latest work of fiction. It is 
not so far a cry from hia more recent chapters on 
" The Art of Living," but even in this latter com- 
parison the distance is considerable, being the dis- 
tance between a light and superficial social philoso- 
phy and a dissection of society that probes far 
beneath the surface and lays bare the nerves and 
arteries. " Unleavened Bread," considered as a 
story, is an account of the career of one ambitious 
woman ; all of its other characters are of minor 
importance, and have little interest for us. Con- 
sidered as a social study, the book is a quiet and 
effective satire upon American democracy, that is, 
upon the pretensions of the democratic spirit to 
reach valid conclusions by the aid of its own un- 
tutored instincts, upon its tendency to substitute 
catchwords for ideas, and to be deceived by its own 
phrases. The satire is effective precisely because 
it is both quiet and restrained ; the writer is too 
conscientious an artist to put violent colors upon his 
canvas. Among the special subjects of his satire 
are the notions of art and of education, of society 
and of politics, that prevail in our middle-class 
American life. The notions of art, for example, 
that make our large cities a medley of incongruous 
architectural styles and that erect grotesque statues 
in our public places ; the notions of education that 
place our schools in the hands of ignorant men and 
fill them with untrained teachers ; the notions of 
society that exalt showiness above refinement, and 
extravagance above simplicity ; the notions of poli- 
tics that make sincerity an almost impossible virtue 
in public life and that blunt both the intellect and 
the moral sense. This seems a rather heavy pro- 
gramme for a work of fiction, and the book itself, 
if not exactly heavy, certainly does not come within 
the category of light reading. It opens in a man- 
ner somewhat suggestive of such a book as the 
" Modern Instance " of Mr. Howells, then it seems 
to suggest something of the moralizing atmosphere 
of Mr. Warner's group of three novels, but in the 
final impression it stands out as a work of distinc- 
tively original type. The ambitious woman about 



whom all the interest centres, and who is so marked 
an embodiment of the crudities, the self-deceptions, 
and the ill-directed aims that are characteristic of 
many of our men and women alike, is a figure 
drawn with extraordinary intellectual detachment, 
and, it must be admitted, has little of the flesh and 
blood that are needed to make such a figure really 
vital. We follow her career with curious interest, 
but we feel all the time that she is a puppet, with 
the strings always in the author's hand. The vital 
characters of fiction do not leave us with this 
impression ; they seem in a way to pass beyond the 
control of the writer, and to act of their own mo- 
tion. In this respect Mr. Grant's heroine is a failure, 
his book is a failure in this sense also, but it is 
nevertheless a remarkable piece of workmanship, 
relatively speaking, and judged with reference to 
its limitations. 

One of the many morals of Mr. Grant's novel is 
that a man knows very little about his wife until 
they have been married for a considerable length 
of time. This rather trite observation is enforced 
in " Unleavened Bread " with so much impressive- 
ness that it gains a deeper meaning than it is wont 
to have. In " The Action and the Word," the 
latest novel of Mr. Brander Matthews, the idea is 
again illustrated, although in this case it affords 
matter for comedy rather than for tragedy, or even 
for serious dramatic effect. We have here the story 
of a New York architect and his wife. The wife 
is a charming woman with a marked aptitude for 
amateur theatricals. Her acting wins such applause 
that her head is almost turned, and she seems upon 
the point of abandoning domestic life for the ex- 
citements of the stage. Happily, her better judg- 
ment triumphs and she gives up the notion, but her 
husband has been startled out of his complacency, 
and the novelist has been provided with the ma- 
terial for a pretty story. The story is not deep, 
certainly, but it exhibits keen insight and deft work- 
manship. It proves exceptionally entertaining, 
which is probably all that the writer expected of it. 

" Robert Tournay," by Mr. William Sage, is a 
conventional romance of the French Revolution, one 
of the many books that find their prototype in 
" Mademoiselle de la Seigliere." There is the usual 
noble family, with its selfish aristocratic prejudices, 
and the usual fair daughter, who has a heart as 
well as a title. There is also the usual man of the 
people, who dares to love the daughter of his aris- 
tocratic master, and to whom the Revolution brings 
the usual opportunities for protecting the woman 
whom he loves from her enemies, and for rescuing 
her from imminent death. As is usually the case 
in novels of this sort, we are told about the destruc- 
tion of the Bastile, the burning of a chateau, and 
the horrors of a Republican noyade on the Loire. 
We have also the familiar story of Republican vic- 
tories on the frontier, and of the Terror in Paris. 
Robespierre and Danton are both here, likewise the 
Conciergerie and the tumbrils and the guillotine. 
We have read it all many times before, but its in- 



126 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



terest seems perennial, and we have no fault to find 
with the author for inviting us to read it again. 

When we are confronted with such a title as 
" The Black Terror : A Romance of Russia," we at 
once know what to expect. There will be nihilists 
and dungeons and conspiracies and reprisals and 
brutal governors and sinister officers of the Third 
Section. There will also be a lovely heroine who 
will aid the hero in some hairbreadth escape. In 
the case of the present novel, the work of Mr. John 
K. Leys, we are not disappointed in any of these 
expectations, and we have besides the story of an 
ingenious plot, successfully carried out, to kidnap 
the Tsar, and keep him in close confinement until 
he grants to his subjects the desired Constitution. 

Mrs. Edith Wharton's second book of fiction is 
not a collection of stories, like " The Greater Incli- 
nation," but a single novel. Yet " The Touchstone," 
although we must call it a novel, has really no more 
substance than one of the briefer sketches. It is 
the story of a single incident, and of its influence 
upon the lives of a man and his wife. It is a story 
that might easily have been told in fifty pages ; the 
hundred additional pages that are given us merely 
serve to permit of a more detailed analysis of the 
situation created by a single thoughtless act. Yet 
we would not spare from the story a single page, 
for the writer's art is so exquisite that no one of 
her pages seems superfluous, or fails in its contribu- 
tion to the deep impressiveness of her psychological 
study. If the book has a defect, that defect must 
be sought in the central conception, and not in the 
treatment. The hero has in his possession a great 
many letters, of the most intimate character, written 
to him by a woman who had loved him all her life, 
but whom he had been incapable of loving in re- 
turn. That woman had become a famous writer, 
and, after her death, anything that could throw 
light upon her personality was eagerly demanded 
by the public. The recipient of the letters, learning 
of this demand, and for lack of money unable to 
marry the woman he loves, actually sells this sacred 
correspondence to a publisher, suppressing his own 
name, and thereby removes the obstacle to his mar- 
riage. When he realizes what he has done he be- 
comes remorseful, and Mrs. Wharton's purpose is 
to direct our attention to the workings of his con- 
science, to excite our sympathies for his sufferings. 
In this she is imperfectly successful, for it would 
tax the powers of the greatest novelist that ever 
lived to be entirely successful in such a task. The 
act in question is so despicable that no motive 
would seem adequate for its justification, no cir- 
cumstances could be found more than palliating in 
the case of such an offense. Mrs. Wharton's treat- 
ment of this theme is all that we might desire, but 
it cannot give us a genuinely sympathetic interest 
in fcuch a person as her hero. We cannot help feel- 
ing that he deserves even more than he suffers, and 
we remain suspicious of any moral regeneration 
that is brought about by means of his remorse. Yet 
it is the clear intention of the writer to have us ac- 



cept this moral regeneration as a fact, and to for- 
give the offender as his own deceived wife forgives 
him in the end. In a word, the substance of this 
book is of a kind to repel rather than to attract ; 
what does attract, and even fascinate, is the delicacy 
of texture and the distinction of style which the 
work exhibits. 

Whatever we may think of Mrs. Atherton's 
" Senator North," it would never occur to us to ac- 
cord it the attributes of delicacy and distinction. 
In the place of the one it has a sort of rude energy ; 
in the place of the other it has a form of expression 
which is rough in sound and crude in coloring, 
which is positively repellant to a refined sense. 
Here is a sentence fairly representative of its style. 
" In ordinary conditions politics are barely men- 
tioned when the most political city in the world is 
in evening dress, but war is a microbe." The in- 
eptitude of that metaphor would be hard to match. 
Mrs. Atherton's novel deals with the social and po- 
litical life of Washington at the present day. The 
heroine is a young woman of aristocratic breeding, 
who becomes weary of the whole empty round of the 
life of a self-styled " society," and who makes up her 
mind to go in for politics. To the horror of her 
family, she actually cultivates the acquaintance of 
Representatives and Senators, and starts a sort of 
salon for the furtherance of her new-found inter- 
ests. The one conspicuous result of this activity is 
the fact that she falls in love with Senator North, a 
statesman of sixty, who has an invalid wife. This 
unnatural passion is reciprocated, and neither of 
the two parties concerned seems to have any par- 
ticularly conscientious scruples, although both have 
a lively sense of the desirability of escaping dis- 
covery. In the end, the invalid wife opportunely 
dies, and conventional morality is spared any further 
outrage. Incidentally, the story makes much of two 
matters of social and political interest. The former 
is the ostracism placed by American prejudice upon 
any woman who has a drop of negro blood in her 
veins. This matter is dealt with in the most mor- 
bid and sensational manner possible. The latter is 
the state of affairs which led to our recent war with 
Spain, and in her treatment of this subject the 
writer displays an unexpected sanity, and exhibits 
a rather remarkable intellectual grasp of the situa- 
tion. Both the unreasoning frenzy which precipi- 
tated that war, and the dangerous sequelce of its 
conclusion, are set forth with an ethical perception 
that is entirely just, and that contrasts strikingly 
with the other ethical ideals of the book. 

Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson's latest novel, " The 
Rebel," turns from the imaginary history wherein 
his invention has of late been exercised to the actual 
history of England in the time of Charles II. It 
takes the form of a memoir of the fourth Earl of 
Cherwell, written by his cousin, and leading up to 
an account of the ri'sing at Taunton in 1684. The 
hero is a noble swashbuckler who has no hesitation 
in setting the laws at defiance, and whose audacity 
fairly takes our breath away. He contrives to stand

well with the King, who has a certain admiration 
for his recklessness, but he is the declared enemy 
of the Duke of York, whose shameful persecution of 
the heroine leaves him indeed no room for respect. 
The heroine is a gentle creature, who serves well 
enough as a foil for her fiery and turbulent defender, 
but who has otherwise slight claim upon our interest. 
It is needless to say that the Duke's villainy comes 
to naught, and that the heroine is rescued from the 
manifold perils that beset her. The plot of the 
narrative is at first confused and difficult to follow, 
but the complications are gradually cleared away, 
and it takes a straightforward course to the close. 
The story is told forcibly and with brilliant ani- 
mation. 

Mr. Frederick W. Hayes is a new writer to us, 
but he deserves well of the novel-reading public. 
His " Kent Squire " is a historical romance of the 
time of Queen Anne and the Duke of Harlborough. 
The latter personage figures prominently in the his- 
tory, and his duplicity is depicted with an unsparing 
hand. French and Spanish political intrigue, as 
well as English, make up a large part of the his- 
torical substance of this highly exciting narrative. 
Indeed, the canvas is so crowded with figures and 
dramatic situations that the reader becomes almost 
dazed in his attempt to keep track of all the per- 
sonal and public interests at stake. That this task 
proves too much for the writer himself is evident in 
the closing chapters, for with respect to some of its 
leading issues the story is not ended at all, it sim- 
ply stops. Most of the incidents are legitimate 
enough for this sort of sensational romance, but 
credulity is strained beyond the breaking-point when 
the hero reappears upon the scene after having been 
hanged by the public executioner, and afterwards 
suspended in chains upon the gibbet. So violent a 
wrench to the feelings might have been spared us 
without serious difficulty, and we might also have 
been spared the apparition of the condemned man 
to his sweetheart some hundreds of miles away. 
Aside from these two constructive defects, the story 
is to be commended for both its invention and its 
acquaintance with the period in question. It is 
evident that the writer has done a great deal of 
" reading up " for his work, that he has delved into 
the memoirs of the age, instead of remaining content, 
as most historical novelists do, with the superficial 
knowledge of the text-books. 

Mr. Max Pemberton's " Fe"o " is the romance of 
a singer in French opera and an Austrian prince. 
The heroine is the daughter of a decayed gentle- 
man who cares for little save his own personal 
comfort, and is not above the meanness of trading 
upon his daughter's beauty. The rank of the hero 
naturally hedges him about with all sorts of barriers 
to the accomplishment of his wishes, and the story 
tells us how he has his way in the end, in spite of all 
the diplomatic locksmiths. It is a story of intrigues 
and duels and abductions, a little melodramatic 
in manner, infused with sentiment, and sparkling 
with interest. No one will regret having read it, 



and no one will remember anything about it a year 
afterwards. 

Mr. E. F. Benson, in "The Princess Sophia," 
again exhibits his versatility. The book may be 
described as standing midway between the frivolity 
of " Dodo " and the seriousness of his two Greek 
novels. The new story is the next thing to being 
Greek itself, for it is about the principality of 
Rhodope*, which lies, " as everyone knows, on the 
wooded coast-line of Albania." It tells about the 
politics of this extremely interesting imaginary 
State, and describes the attempt of Petros, the hus- 
band of the Princess, acting as regent in her ab- 
sence from the capital, to subvert the government, 
and get secure possession of the reins of power. 
The thwarting of this plot provides the story with 
a really thrilling climax, although the spirit of the 
book throughout is that of refined comedy rather 
than of anything more serious. The interest of the 
story is concentrated in the character of the Prin- 
cess, and her passion for gambling, which leads her 
to the very brink of disaster, and which has a most 
demoralizing influence upon her subjects. 

Mr. S. R. Crockett has now close upon a score of 
romances to his credit, and there is no reason why 
he should not make the number twoscore within a 
few years. He evidently writes with the ease of a 
Dumas, and his invention never seems to flag. Two 
of his books are now before us : one a romance of 
the fifteenth century, entitled "Joan of the Sword 
Hand "; the other a more modern tale of his own 
Scotland and of the West Indies, entitled " The 
Isle of the Winds." Both stories abound in pic- 
turesque incident and exciting adventure, both are 
about as unreal as stories of the sort can possibly 
be, and both are fairly reeking with sentimentality. 
The latter of the two has, we observe, been pre- 
viously published with another title. 

In writing " The Minx, " Mrs. Mannington 
Caffyn has determined to be "smart" at any cost. 
Her epigrams have the air of being profoundly 
philosophical, and the conversation of her characters 
fairly coruscates with intellectual brilliancy. She 
never permits one of them to express even a com- 
monplace idea without giving it a verbal turn that 
seems impressive until we look closely enough to 
detect its emptiness. In a word, the style of the 
book is simply intolerable, and the story has not 
intrinsic interest enough to be worth disentangle- 
ment from all the verbiage which invests it. It is 
about a young woman who takes life with intense 
seriousness and does not know which of two lovers 
to accept. The one satisfies her intellectual ideals, 
but the other appeals to the just-awakening emo- 
tional side of her nature. Eventually, the heart 
triumphs over the head, and her final choice rests 
upon the warm-hearted fox-hunting country gentle- 
man whose whole way of looking at life stands in 
violent contrast to the abstract ideals which she has 
hitherto held sacred. 

A novel published last year by Mrs. Henry 
Dudeney forced us to condemn the uncompromising

realism of the writer both with respect to choice 
of subject and to treatment in spite of the mani- 
fest power of the book. " Folly Corner," a second 
story by the same writer, is less open to objection, 
and it is possible for praise to balance blame, if not 
actually to outweigh it. There is still much un- 
necessary insistence upon unlovely and squalid 
details, and some unnecessary obtrusion of those 
phases of life concerning which no writer can be 
too reticent, but there is also a sombre power to 
envisage the tragical side of everyday life which 
goes far to redeem the grossness of the writer's 
naturalism. We read this book with something of 
the feeling aroused by the later books of Mr. 
Thomas Hardy, a feeling in which admiration for 
undeniable talent is all the time struggling with 
impatience of a perverse method. This suggestion 
of Mr. Hardy is no mere fancy, for he is certainly 
the master whom Mrs. Dudeney would acknowledge 
among the writers of to-day. 

The second half of " Knights of the Cross," by 
Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz, carries on the story of 
the struggle between Poland and the Teutonic 
Knights, ending with the battle of Grtlnwald and 
the final overthrow of the Order. This climax is 
not without impressiveness, yet its effect is far from 
equal to that of several episodes to be found in the 
author's earlier trilogy of Polish history. It does 
not begin to stir the blood as the siege of Chensto- 
hova, for example, stirs it. Nor does Zbyshko 
make as satisfactory a hero as Kmita or Pan 
Michael. There is a great deal of fighting in the 
book, but it grows rather monotonous, and is not 
diversified by such feats of individual prowess as 
hold us spellbound in the romances of the earlier 
series. Nor is there any figure for a moment com- 
parable with that pf Zagloba, which must stand as 
the greatest of the author's creative triumphs. It 
is only in comparison with the author's own best 
that the present romance suffers. Were it our 
introduction to his genius, we should find it difficult 
to praise sufficiently the historical pageant which it 
unfolds, its simple strong-souled figures swayed by 
primitive passions, its brilliant invention, and its 
racy humor. But all of these things are exhibited 
to much better advantage in the great trilogy, and 
we fear that Mr. Sienkiewicz will not again reach 
the level of that colossal work. 

Still another of Mr. Jokai's novels has been 
translated for us, the selection this time being " The 
Baron's Sons," and the translator Mr. Percy Favor 
Bicknell. Some abridgements have been made, for 
which a very lame excuse is offered, but otherwise 
the translation is satisfactory. The story is con- 
cerned with the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and 
combines the use of historical material with domestic 
incidents in a happy and interesting fashion. The 
thread of the narrative is a little difficult to follow, 
which is probably due in part to the liberties taken 
by the translator. On the whole, the story is one 
of the author's best, as far as they have been trans- 



lated, and does not strain our credulity as much as 
some of its predecessors have done. 

A few words about two recent translations from 
the Spanish may be given in closing this review. 
" Currita, Countess of Albornoz " is the work of a 
Jesuit priest, Senor Luis Coloma by name. It is a 
novel of Madrid society about thirty years ago, and 
is concerned with political intrigue as well as with 
the doings of the fashionable world. The author- 
ship of the work leads us to expect a strong infu- 
sion of clericalism, in which we are not disappointed ; 
but the foremost aim of the novelist is to draw a 
picture of social corruption rather than to play the 
part of the avowed preacher, and he brings to this 
task the full equipment of an experienced observer 
and a master of incisive and caustic speech. The 
work is rather shapeless as a whole, but it has much 
brilliant detail, and its moral lesson is made all the 
sharper for being left rather implicit than out- 
spoken. It is clear that we are all the time in con- 
tact with a richly cultured mind, and this gives so 
much satisfaction to the reader of discernment that 
the amateurish character of the artistic perform- 
ance may easily be overlooked. We could wish 
that a better English version of the work had been 
given us. The translator seems to have a fair 
knowledge of Spanish, but she is all at sea in the 
presence of the scholarly allusions and foreign 
proper names with which the novel is plentifully 
sprinkled. 

" The Joy of Captain Ribot " is not only an in- 
teresting novel, it is also a work of gracious and 
exquisite art. Although it has for its theme the 
love of a man for a woman already married, it is at 
once so delicate and so noble in its treatment that 
the author's own claim is justified when he calls it, 
in a private letter, " a protest from the depths 
against the eternal adultery of the French novel." 
For the "joy" of its hero is not eo much in his 
love as in the moral triumph which keeps that love 
unsullied, and rises victorious above every tempta- 
tion. So clean and wholesome a work rarely comes 
to us from a novelist of Latin race; its idealism 
makes not the slightest compromise with evil, and 
in its spirituality there is no base admixture. Yet 
with all this exultation of sentiment, the story is 
convincingly real ; it is a story of everyday people, 
and of life unfalsified by rose-colored glasses. Mr. 
Howells is entirely right when he describes the 
book as "a novel of manners, the modern manners 
of provincial Spain "; and when he adds that 
" while we were spoiling our prostrate foe, I wish 
we could have got some of these," he expresses a 
feeling that must be stirring in many an American 
conscience, now that we are starting on the painful 
path of recovery from our national military de- 
bauch. It is certainly difficult to find words ad- 
equate to express the admirable qualities of this 
latest of the novels of Sefior Valde's, or of the 
genius of the nation that can boast the possession 
of such writers. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

BRIEFS 



BOOKS. 



We have had, of recent years, some 

New text-books in r i , r . i i . T-< 

English literature. fa . irl y satisfactory text-books in En- 
glish literature, but there is room 
for improvement in the best of them, and we are 
glad to observe the appearance of several new com- 
petitors for the favor of educators. Among the 
many books upon this subject which we have exam- 
ined, we are inclined to give the palm to the " History 
of English Literature " (American Book Co.) re- 
cently prepared by Mr. Reuben Post Halleck. For 
selection and arrangement of material, for usefulness 
of pictorial illustration, and for its happy faculty of 
saying just the right thing about a given author or 
work, it would be difficult to improve upon this 
text. It provides a continuous and interesting his- 
tory of our literature, and contrives to keep a 
middle course between the dry summary on the 
one hand, and the discursive essay on the other. 
The writer believes thoroughly in teaching the his- 
tory of the subject as well as in taking up the study 
of individual works. He justly says : " Various 
masterpieces seem like unconnected islands in an 
unexplored ocean. There is no way of making 
these masterpieces seem otherwise except by teach- 
ing the history and development of the literature of 
which they form a part." The apparatus of this 
book, with its directions for required and optional 
reading and its suggestive questions and exercises, 
is remarkably good. One feature of particular in- 
terest is the literary map of England which serves 
as a frontispiece. We take great pleasure in com- 
mending this work to the attention of teachers. A 
literary map also accompanies the " History of 
English Literature" (Sibley & Ducker) which 
Professor F. V. N. Painter has recently published. 
This book is an expansion of the writer's earlier 
"Introduction," and deals at length with nearly 
twice as many authors. Eight periods are recog- 
nized, and to each of them a considerable chapter 
is devoted. The method employed is that of writing 
an essay upon each period as a whole, and then 
dealing in considerable detail with a few selected 
writers. Thirty -two authors altogether, from 
Chaucer to Ruskin, are thus singled out for some- 
what elaborate treatment. This method has the 
obvious defect of giving other great writers much 
less than their due in the history of our literature. 
We cannot entirely approve of a work that relegates 
Fielding in the Queen Anne period, Burke in the 
Johnsonian period, and Keats in the Romantic 
period, to the position of minor writers. The au- 
thor's style is too discursive to be in the best sense 
practical. His essays make pleasant reading, but 
they do not make the most satisfactory sort of 
teaching material. He is the kind of writer, more- 
over, who speaks of " female poets," and who calls 
Byron " immoral." Such infelicities of diction and 
characterization have a slightly jarring effect, and 
do not commend the writer to persons of nice judg- 
ment. A third recent text-book upon this subject 



is the " Outline History of English and American 
Literature" (American Book Co.) written by Dr. 
Charles F. Johnson. The writer's object has been 
" to compress into this book the minimum of what 
every young person should know of the literature 
of his own country and England, even if his educa- 
tion is strictly scientific." The author recognizes 
ten periods in the history of English literature, but 
preserves the sense of proportion in dealing with 
the writers of each of the periods. In spite of the 
fact that he deals with both English and American 
literature in a single volume, he finds room for 
numerous extracts, many of them of considerable 
length. The book is remarkably well written, and 
will be welcomed by teachers who find their English 
courses unduly limited by the pressure of other 
subjects upon the curriculum. 

Memoirs of a John Adams, the New England 
New England schoolmaster, was a man " of the old 
school " both in character and educa- 
tional methods. Born in 1772 and dying in 1863, 
his life touched the two greatest of our national 
experiences, and covered the period of our estab- 
lishment as an independent and united nation. 
Through his influence upon thousands of young men 
who, at Phillips Academy, at Andover, and other 
schools, were under his care, Mr. Adams bore an 
honorable part in the work of upbuilding the country. 
The list of prominent men trained at Andover dur- 
ing the twenty-two years he was its principal is a 
long one. Oliver Wendell Holmes was one of them, 
and has given in his verses many pictures of the 
life there. He refers to Mr. Adams in the well- 
known lines : 

" Uneasy lie the heads of all that rule, 
His most of all whose kingdom is a school." 

While Mr. Adams will be chiefly remembered as 
principal of Andover Academy, to many he is an 
interesting figure as the father of the brilliant New 
York minister, Reverend William Adams ; to others, 
as a pioneer missionary of the S. S. Union in Illi- 
nois ; to others still, as one of the original circle of 
philanthropists from whose labors grew the Amer- 
ican Tract Society and the Temperance movement. 
He was a man of profound religious convictions and 
a high sense of spiritual obligations. His character 
had no complexity or uncertainties. It was built 
about one simple all-controlling quality, " devoted- 
ness to duty "; it had but one simple unchanging 
aim, to serve God and his generation. Contact 
with such a nature, in life or in books, is refreshing. 
In bringing before the reader this strong and useful 
life, the authors of the well- written memoir of Mr. 
Adams recently published (Scribner) give also an 
entertaining and valuable picture of the character- 
istics and educational methods of a New England 
academy. It is this portrayal, together with the in- 
teresting associations of his long life, that give to 
this memoir more than a private value. The book 
is noticeably well printed and bound, and evinces 
good taste throughout.

The volume of " Liberty Poems " 
(J<*e8 H. West Co.), which has 
been compiled in the interest of the 
anti-imperialist agitation, ought to prove an effective 
auxiliary in the cause of justice and public morality, 
now at stake as only once before in the history of 
our country. It is a collection of about seventy-five 
pieces of verse, written by various hands in various 
manners, and inspired by a common indignation at 
the attempted subversion of the fundamental prin- 
ciples of our government. We wish it were possible 
to say that all of these poems rose to the height of 
their great occasion. But most of them belong to 
the category of newspaper verse, hastily written by 
persons having no special aptitude for the poetic 
art. If Lowell and Whittier and Emerson were 
still alive, a very different collection would be 
possible ; for who could doubt that their voices 
would again be raised in behalf of human freedom, 
as they were so effectively raised fifty years ago? 
As it is, very few of the names signed to these 
pieces have any literary significance whatever. The 
best poems in the collection are Mr. William Lloyd 
Garrison's thirteen sonnets, Mr. W. C. Gannett's 
" At the Peace Congress," Miss Baskam's " The 
Voice of the Lord," and a selection from Mr. 
William Vaughn Moody's noble " Ode in Time of 
Hesitation." We must find room for one quotation, 
and it shall be Mr. Garrison's tribute to Governor 
Boutwell, that venerable and venerated statesman, 
the representative of a vanishing type, who has de- 
clared himself with no uncertain voice to stand 
upon the side of Washington and Jefferson and 
Lincoln in the present crisis : 

" Not thine the sadness of an outlived fame, 
Nor fate to lag superfluous on the stage : 
Thou addest only strength to ripest age, 

And lustre to a lifelong honored name. 

In a degenerate day, when public shame 
And private avarice stain the nation's page, 
When sordid ends the growing youth engage, 

Thy burning words are like a torch of flame. 
New England glories in thy manhood rare, 

Which, breaking party shackles, stands erect 
And breathing deeply of diviner air, 

Enrolls thy name among the great elect. 
Thy topmost boughs the richest leafage bear, 

Thy latest fruit compels the world's respect."

It is not every genealogist, however, who is able to 
write the story of his own life, in order that no fu- 
ture family historian may have occasion to blame 
him for omitting to preserve details of possible in- 
terest to descendants. The love of genealogy led 
to the publication, by General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, 
of Mansfield, Ohio, of his " Recollections of a Life- 
time " (Robert Clarke Company). For years Mr. 
Brinkerhoff has been a recognized leader of move- 



ments having for their purpose the improvement of 
the condition of criminals and unfortunates, and in 
this capacity he has been interested in National 
Congresses of Charities and Corrections, National 
Prison Congresses, and in many state movements. 
The most valuable chapters in the volume are those 
which are taken up with discussions of these mat- 
ters. For the most part, the life described is that 
of the average man, who, as school-teacher, lawyer, 
or soldier, plays well his part in the social circles 
of his home city, is honored and respected by his 
neighbors and friends, and by reason of years of 
faithful "adherence to the principles of right living 
makes himself a place in his day and generation. 
The story will, of course, have most interest for 
those who have known the author during his long 

and useful life. 

Summary of the A summary, in chronological order, 
jurisprudence of the principal features of the juris- 
of the world. prudence of the leading peoples of 

the world, has been prepared by Professor Guy 
Carleton Lee, of Johns Hopkins University, and 
published under the title " Historical Jurispru- 
dence " (Macmillan). Finding "the foundations 
of law " in the jurisprudence of Babylonia, Egypt, 
Israel, and India, the author exhibits "the develop- 
ment of jurisprudence " as displayed in the Roman 
systems of law, to which over a third of his less 
than two hundred pages are appropriately devoted. 
The great work of Justinian is explained at some 
length, and the projections of the Roman Law into 
mediaeval times are illustrated under the titles of 
the " Canon Law " and the " Barbarian Codes." 
The survival of the elaborate Roman system in 
modern times is traced into the laws of the western 
continental states of Europe, and the laws of Scot- 
land, in which it secured permanent position. The 
book closes with an account of the introduction of 
the principles of the civil law into the jurisprudence 
of England. From the evidences of customary law 
furnished by the unearthed contract-tablets of Baby- 
lonia, to the early commentaries on the law of 
England, runs the curriculum of this new study in 
jurisprudence, on the comparative historical plan. 
The book is full of meat, and though intended as 
" an introduction to the systematic study of the de- 
velopment of law " (see title-page) it will prove of 
much interest to all students of general history. 

The memories of a man who has 

y^sssa Hved much and has the art f teiiin g 

about it gracefully can hardly fail to 
be entertaining. Mr. H. Sutherland Edwards, in 
his "Personal Recollections" (Cassell), has given 
us the record of a long and rich experience, and has 
told the tale with an easy flow of narrative that 
takes one swiftly and pleasantly from story to story. 
Mr. Edwards has clearly enjoyed living, for other- 
wise the incidents that gave life form and color for 
him could not have impressed themselves upon his 
memory with such sure distinctness, they are so 
many and sometimes so slight. Occasionally a

sudden transition to the inconsequential gives the 
reader an unpleasant sensation. " I have no doubt 
that the military type-setter was well paid. Herzen 
was a generous man, and had abundant private 
means. He called his paper the Bell and he had 
himself a voice like a bell, musical and sonorous." 
But perhaps these things merely authenticate the 
record to something more than artificiality in the 
glow of a fresh and lively remembrance. Mr. 
Edwards's memories, as he makes note of them, are 
largely of persons rather than events, artists, 
musicians, statesmen, Russian, and Italian revolu- 
tionaries, actors and managers. Tennyson and 
Browning figure in the pages, von Billow, Wagner, 
Verdi, Macready, Lewes, Reade, Thackeray, and a 
host of lesser men of various abilities and more or 
less interesting personalities. Douglas Jerrold's 
caustic wit and the more genial pleasantries of 
others known to fame brighten the pages abun- 
dantly, and the running comment on men and man- 
ners that makes up the thick volume has the sparkle 
of brilliant conversation, if it has also at times the 
scrappiness into which such conversation may lapse. 
There is in the book no serious dealing with the men 
and women upon whose lives it touches, but in 
anecdote and in side-lights upon character it is dis- 
tinctly rich and entertaining.

ing Fish, that is to say, how to make a Man that 
was none, to be an Angler by a book." Never- 
theless, Isaak Walton has left us a piscatorial as 
well as a literary classic. But the " Compleat 
Angler " was written for other lands and days. 
Americans who love and practice this fascinating 
form of recreation will find Mr. McCarthy's vol- 
ume on " Familiar Fish " (Appleton) replete from 
cover to cover with fisherman's lore from the pen 
of one of their successful confreres. Mr. McCarthy 
writes with the spirit of the true sportsman, and 
those who would learn the art will find in his book 
a sympathetic account of the life and haunts of our 
fresh-water game fish. Details of rods and tackle, 
and counsel as to fly-casting, with suggestions for 
outfits and for the conduct of camp-life, make the 
book a valuable one for all campers and sportsmen. 
The ichthyological references have been supervised 
by President David Starr Jordan, whose facile pen 
also contributes a prefatory note which discusses 
the raison d' etre of angling and the comparative 
ethics of " hog-fishing " and piscatorial prevarica- 
tions. 

The meditation* of Ifc is a Volume f 8OUnd and thought- 

a prelate and a ful essay s and addresses that Bishop 
student of affairs, gpalding presents us under the gen- 
eral title of " Opportunity, and Other Essays " 
(McClurg). Showing on every page the marks of 
the scholar and the thinker, they are vitalized by 
the fine earnestness of a broad vision of life and a 
noble enthusiasm for the good it has to offer. Bishop 



Spalding is no narrow churchman or pedant, and 
the breath of the larger needs of life and its larger 
activities gives a bracing atmosphere to the volume. 
In the opening essay, which gives its title to the 
book, there is perhaps the finer flavor, a suggestion 
of Emerson in style and hardly less in the quality 
of rapt prescience in the mysteries of life and its 
possibilities. There are eight chapters in all, rang- 
ing in theme from " The University, A Nursery of 
the Higher Life " and " Goethe as Educator " to 
" Empire or Republic." This last address, and the 
one preceding it in the book, are words for the 
times to give us thoughtful pause; but for that 
reason, it may be, their literary charm is perhaps 
less distinct and enjoyable. For its stimulus to the 
living of the life that is worth while, for its clear 
and wholesome doctrine of optimistic endeavor, 
packed to almost epigrammatic fulness, the little 
volume is well worth reading and well worth having 
at hand for the idle moment when a page or two of 
kindly wisdom is a pleasing tonic. 

wuiiam Watson The Catholic Apostolic movement has 
Andrew passed more and more into obscurity. 

It was one of the movements which 
never greatly appealed to the popular mind or 
heart. But it appealed to many rare minds and 
noble characters, of whom a memorial volume on 
William Watson Andrews ( Putnam ) recalls one. 
William Watson Andrews was the Congregational 
minister of Kent, Connecticut, when he came under 
the influence of the new teaching and found him- 
self in growing sympathy with it. He believed that 
it was the will of God to meet the needs of the 
time by a revival of the Apostolate. Nothing could 
be of a finer spirit than the words in which he 
finally asked dismission from the church in which 
he had been reared. The same spirit seemed only 
to be heightened by the adversities and isolation 
which followed his entrance into the new fold. He 
never gained the ear of the public, nor was he 
greatly successful in propagating the new creed, but 
throughout his life his was a friendship prized by 
some of the foremost of our intellectual and spirit- 
ual leaders, and in that circle he was always a 
power by reason of his personality, his learning, 
and his great spiritual gifts. The memorial volume 
is an interesting and valuable one. 

A new volume Xt is always a pleasure to record the 
in Mr. Murray's appearance of the successive volumes 
edition of Byron. of Mr Murray's excellent edition of 
Byron (Scribner). The volume before us, the third 
of the poetry, contains the metrical tales which 
confirmed Byron's fame after the great success of 
" Childe Harold," together with the miscellaneous 
pieces of the same period. The numerous notes 
gratifyingly confirm one's impression of the taste, 
vigilance, and precision of Mr. Coleridge, who is 
earning the admiration of students and the grati- 
tude of the poet's lovers. This volume contains six 
full-page illustrations, the most interesting of these

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



King Alfred's 
" best book " in 



being a reproduction of Hayter's handsome drawing 
of Mrs. Leigh ("Augusta"). The qualities of this 
edition we have enlarged upon in preceding num- 
bers of THE DIAL: they are such that it must 
supersede all others, irrespective of the considerable 
amount of new material it contains. We wish Mr. 
Coleridge good speed in the great task of editing 
"Don Juan," which he regards as Byron's "great- 
est work." The illustration of a poem so wide- 
ranging and various must severely tax the resources 
of the most accomplished editor. 

The coming year is the millenary of 
the death of King Alfred, and to its 
modem English. ce i e b ra tion Mr. Walter John Sedge- 
field makes a highly acceptable contribution by 
publishing, through the Oxford University Press, a 
modern English translation of " King Alfred's 
Version of the Consolations of Boethius." Mr. 
Sedgefield has previously edited the Old English 
text of this " best book " of the King of the West 
Saxons, and his present work is thus a sort of sup- 
plement to his earlier one. The alliterative verses 
of the original are reproduced in Old English metre, 
and printed together at the end of the volume. In 
the body of the text, the editor has distinguished by 
means of italics the additions made by Alfred to the 
work of the Roman philosopher. This is a particu- 
larly interesting feature of the translation, for it 
enables us to follow the very workings of Alfred's 
mind as he labored for the instruction and moral 
welfare of his subjects. The editor's introduction 
is valuable, and includes specimen extracts from the 
preceding English versions of Boethius. 

Newly edited Professor W. P. Ker has put all 
critical writings students of English literature, and 
cf John Dryden. e8pec j a n v o f English criticism, in his 
debt by editing the " Essays of John Dryden " for 
the Oxford University Press. The work occupies 
two volumes, and includes the bulk of Dryden's 
critical writings, together with a commentary and 
extensive notes. " It is not meant to take the place 
of Scott or of Malone ; but may serve as a conven- 
ient book for reference, to be used especially by 
such readers as are interested in criticism and the 
history of criticism, and who may be glad to have 
Dryden's critical opinions put before them in a 
form adapted for ready consultation and compari- 
son." In all cases but one, the text has been col- 
lated with the original editions ; but the editor has 
thought it best to modernize the spelling and give 
uniformity to the punctuation. The scholarship of 
the author of " Epic and Romance " needs no cer- 
tificate, and it is a matter of course that he has 
done his editorial work in an admirable way. 

For unprotected The American woman going abroad 
American women for the first time and without a man 

going abroad. to look after her w j n fin( j the Httle 

book entitled " European Travel for Women " 
(Macmillan), by Mary Cadwallader Jones, worth 
its weight in gold. In it the thousand and one 



anxious queries that rise to the lips of the unpro- 
tected female tourist after she is fairly " in the 
thick of it " are answered in advance in a most 
practical and satisfactory way. As the author states 
it, the book is " intended especially for the use of 
women, to suggest what they had better take with 
them in going abroad for the first time, and to tell 
them how they can get about most comfortably 
after landing." Special chapters deal with travel 
in England, France, Germany, and Italy, respect- 
ively ; and there is a table of well-selected useful 
foreign phrases. In short, the woman who has 
mastered the contents of this little manual may 
venture on the unknown sea of European travel 
with a comparatively light heart. 

An account of '' Spencer and Spencerism " (Double- 
Herbert Spencer day, Page & Co.) is the title of a 

and hit system. ugeful 1|ule volume o f 233 pages, 

wherein Mr. Hector Macpherson essays not only 
" to present to the general reader Spencerism in 
lucid, coherent shape," but to convey in outline 
some knowledge of the career and personality of 
the author of the system. The book was under- 
taken with Mr. Spencer's approval ; and while it 
is, as it should be, the work of a disciple of his, it 
is not that of a slavish one. Mr. Macpherson is a 
good expositor, and something more than an ex- 
positor, his work showing throughout a rather critical 
bias a tendency to collate and classify philosoph- 
ical ideas, as well as merely to elucidate them and 
simplify the form of their original expression. As 
an essay in Spencerism, the book is decidedly sug- 
gestive, and the general reader will find it helpful 
on its expository side. 

Educators will note with interest the 
appearance of a life of the late " Joel 
Dorman Steele " (Barnes), by Mrs. 
George Archibald. Dr. Steele made his mark in 
life as a popular instructor and successful adminis- 
trator, as well as the author of a series of text-books 
upon the merits of which opinion is still divided. 
Mrs. Archibald's life is the uncritical and affec- 
tionate tribute of an ex-pupil to a master to whom 
she was personally much attached ; and it is pre- 
fixed by an autobiographical fragment outlining its 
author's career down to about 1867. From the 
book may be gathered passim passages indicating 
Dr. Steele's somewhat original notions as to quelling 
the " old Adam " and sowing the seeds of virtue 
and knowledge in the youthful mind. " Pedagogue " 
is writ large (and somewhat repellantly) on the 
portrait which forms the frontispiece. 

A translation from the German, by 
Henrietta Szold,of Volume I., which 
constitutes Part I., of " The Ethics 
of Judaism," by Professor M. Lazarus of the Uni- 
versity of Berlin, is issued in presentable form by 
The Jewish Publication Society of America (Phila- 
delphia). The remaining three volumes of the 
work are to be published at regular intervals. The

THE DIAL 



133 



present volume is divided into three chapters re- 
spectively headed, "On the Sources of Jewish 
Ethics," " The Principle of Jewish Ethics," " The 
Character of Jewish Ethics." Dr. Lazarus's treat- 
ment of his theme is strictly objective and scientific, 
and his work bids fair to supply when completed, 
through its portrayal of the inner life of Judaism, 
a needed supplement to the monumental History of 
Graetz. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The source extracts from American history, prepared 
by Professor Howard W. Caldwell, of the University of 
Nebraska, and published by Mr. J. H. Miller, have 
frequently received our commendation, and we are now 
glad to have the entire collection bound up in a single 
volume. The volume includes two series of ten num- 
bers each, their respective subjects being " A Survey of 
American History " and " American Territorial Devel- 
opment." The latter series comes down to the present 
year, and includes extracts from State papers and other 
sources bearing upon the inglorious war of subjugation 
in which the country of Washington and Lincoln is now 
engaged. 

To most English readers, Joseph Glanvill is nothing 
more than a name, the name of an obscure English 
writer of the seventeenth century, from whom Matthew 
Arnold got the story of " The Scholar Gypsy." Those 
who wish to make his further acquaintance may now 
be directed to a monograph prepared by Dr. Ferris 
Greenslet in pursuance of his study for a degree at 
Columbia University. This monograph, published for 
the University by the Macmillan Co., is the first number 
in a new series of " Studies in English." We cannot 
commend too highly the practice of this University in 
publishing these dissertations in the form of ordinary 
books. The present volume is thoroughly creditable to 
the department whence it issues, and a valuable contri- 
bution to the history of English literature. 

A moderate sized volume of " Selected Writings of 
Isaac M. Wise," prefixed by a hundred pages of biog- 
raphy, the joint work of David Philipson and Louis 
Grossman, is published under the auspices of the Alum- 
na! Association of the Hebrew Union College, by the 
Robert Clarke Co. Dr. Wise was for over half a cen- 
tury a conspicuous figure in American Jewish life, and 
the writings selected for the present volume may be 
pronounced as representative of their author's style and 
opinions, as they are thoughtful, public-spirited, and 
earnest. There are half a dozen illustrations which 
acceptably crown this worthy memorial volume. 

Two new volumes in the " Famous Scots Series " 
(Scribner) are Mr. Edward Pennington's " Sir David 
Wilkie" and Mr. A. R. MacE wen's "The Erskines." 
The particular Erskines treated of by Mr. MacEwen 
were the brothers Ebenezer and Ralph, famous in the 
annals of the Scotch church in the eighteenth century. 
The early history of the Secession church, of which 
Ebenezer Erskine was the founder, may be read in out- 
line in Mr. MacEwen's scholarly little book. The life 
of Wilkie forms an interesting story in itself, as well as 
an important chapter in the history of British art; and 
Mr. Penniugton tells it well and with due discrimina- 
tion, quoting the critics pro and con, and holding the 
balance pretty fairly between them. 



NOTES. 



Shakespeare's " Julius Caesar," edited by Dr. G. C. D. 
Odell, is an English text recently published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" An Epitome of the New Testament," in the Greek 
text, has been prepared by Professor Nicholas J. 
Stoft'el, of Notre Dame University, and is issued from 
the press of that institution. 

Daudet's " Kings in Exile," translated by Miss 
Katharine Prescott Wormeley, has been published by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., in an edition uniform 
with their other novels by this author. 

The first number of a little periodical to be called 
" Noon," devoted to the reprinting of popular and 
" famous " poetry, will be issued early this month by 
Mr. William S. Lord of Evanstou, 111. 

The Macmillan Co. have just sent us a new edition 
of " Elizabeth and Her German Garden," containing 
something like fifty pages of new matter, and intended 
by the writer to be the final form of the work. 

An historical essay on " The Hiding of the Charter," 
by Mr. Charles J. Hoadly, is announced as the second 
publication of the Acorn Club of New Haven, an asso- 
ciation organized for the purpose of issuing works bear- 
ing on the history and literature of Connecticut. 

Volumes XI. and XII. of the " Cornell Studies in 
Classical Philology " (Macmillan) have just been pub- 
lished. The former is an " Index in Xenophontis 
Memorabilia," prepared by Misses Catharine M. Gloth 
and Mary F. Kellogg; the latter is "A Study of the 
Greek Pecan," the work of Dr. Arthur Fairbanks. 

" Rome: Its Rise and Fall," by Dr. Philip Van Ness 
Myers (Ginn), is an expansion of the author's smaller 
text-book of Roman history into a volume of over five 
hundred pages, with many maps and other illustrations. 
The success long since achieved by Dr. Myers as a 
writer of text-books guarantees the scholarship and the 
practical usefulness of this new work. 

It is announced that the reorganization of the affairs 
of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. is practically completed, 
that all their obligations have been or shortly will be 
met in full, and that their business will go on with the 
old management and on an efficient financial basis. 
This announcement will be gratifying to the friends of 
this old and honorable house, and to the American 
book trade generally. 

The " International Catalogue of Scientific Litera- 
ture " is now well under way, and publication will be- 
gin next year. Seventeen subjects will be comprised, 
and a volume for each subject will be ready some time 
during the year. The price of subscription is 17, and 
the Smithsonian Institution will receive applications 
from this country. Three hundred sets must be sjub- 
scribed for in order to secure the production of this 
work, and the forty-five sets allotted to the United 
States should be taken up without delay. 

Mr. J. R. Tutin's "Concordance" to FitzGerald's 
translation of Omar, published by the Macmillan Co., 
seems to us to be the very acme of useless labor. A 
Concordance is a work which helps us to find a striking 
word or phrase in a voluminous writer, and we often 
find such a work useful; but we cannot conceive of the 
existence of persons who will wish to know exactly how 
many times, and in what places, FitzGerald used such 
words as " and " and " the " in the several editions of 
his slender sheaf of quatrains.

With 40 illustrations from original drawings by F. C. Tohn, E. C. Peixotto, Seymour Lucas, Frank Craig,

/^OVERNOR ROOSEVELT'S monograph on Cromwell is a most vivid and condensed account of the 
great Protector and his times, written with special reference to the birth of English liberty and its relation 

to the growth of American liberty and American institutions. It is the most important and elaborate his- 

torical essay which Governor Roosevelt has written. 



TV/f R- BARRIE'S new novel has been accepted everywhere as the most important book which he has yet 
written a character study of remarkable originality, presented with power, humor, and pathos. "The 
inimitable Tommy," says one reviewer, "redeems the promise of his youth, and Barrie presents him so lov- 
ingly that he is fascinating." The advance orders for the novel are so large as to make a first edition of 
40,000 copies necessary. 

" The reappearance of Barrie and Tommy in SCRIBNER'S // cause for devout rejoicing among novel-aweary 
readers. Here are originality and quiet humor, and deft workmanship to make even the most sated take 
courage once more.'''' New York Evening Post.

TPHE frankness and the fearlessness with which Mr. Davis described, in his articles for SCRIBNER'S MAGA- 
ZINE and in his newspaper letters, what he saw and heard in South Africa, coupled with his extraordinary 
faculty of observing the significant thing and for making it vivid, give a unique quality to this book, and 
differentiate it sharply from the score or more of volumes dealing with various aspects of the same subject. 
Mr. Davis was alone, moreover, in observing the war from both the British and the Boer points of view, and 
his book has therefore, in addition to its piquant personal quality, a completeness which is one of its most 
valuable characteristics.

'"pHIS is the most important and longest piece of fiction that Miss Sea well has yet done. It is a romance 
of the seventeenth century, dealing with the friends of the exiled Stuarts, and is full of adventure. It is 
a time to which Miss Seawell has given special study and which always exerts a great fascination. The 
author's dramatic style, so well exemplified in "The Sprightly Adventures of Marsac," is still more 
apparent in this new work.

Memoirs of Alexander I.

By Mine. LA COMTESSE DE CHOISEUL-GOUFFIER. 

Translated from the French by Mary Berenice 

Patterson. With Portraits. 12mo, gilt top, deckel 

edges, $1.50. 

The author of this volume was an intimate friend of 
Alexander and an ardent supporter of his foreign and 
domestic policy. The book is full of bright and witty say- 
ings, and presents a remarkably true portrait of Alexander, 
who occupied, during the first quarter of the nineteenth 
century, as pre-eminent a position in the world of diplomacy 
as did Napoleon in military affairs. Only two copies of the 
original of this work are known to exist, from one of which 
the present translation has been made. 

"An excellent translation." The Outlook. 

" It is a pleasure to open and a delight to read the book, 
and one wishes the end had been yet further on. Whoever 
found and brought back to us these memoirs has our 
thanks." The Living Church. 

The Cardinal's Musketeer. 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR, author of " On the Red 
Staircase," " An Imperial Lover," " A Yankee Vol- 
unteer," "The House of the Wizard." 12 mo, 
$1.25. 

A rousing tale of adventure and love, whose scenes are 
laid in France in the time of Richelieu. 

"From opening to close a strong interest imbues the 
pages. It is a tale of adventure told with spirit. A charm- 
ing love-current runs through it, ending as it should. We 
commend it as a story, bright and clean, well written, and 
thoroughly engaging." The Independent. 

"It is a strong, well-studied reproduction of the times 
of Cardinal Richelieu. . . . " The Indianapolis News. 

Opportunity, 

And Other Essays and Addresses. 

By Rt. Rev. J. L. SPALDING, Bishop of Peoria, 
author of " Education and the Higher Life," 
Things of the Mind," etc. 12mo, $1.00. 
The volume contains essays on Opportunity ; Woman 

and the Higher Education ; The University ; Goethe as 

Educator ; The Patriot ; and Empire or Republic. 

" Full of noble thought set forth in singularly genial, 

graceful and eloquent speech." The Chicago Tribune. 
" ' Opportunity ' is a volume such as one might profitably 

catch up from one's reading-table dozens of times in a 

week." The Boston Budget. 

Oh, What a Plague is Love! 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of " The Dear Irish 
Girl," She Walks in Beauty," etc. 12mo, 75 cts. 
In this bright little story the author has told in a most 
entertaining way how a too keen susceptibility to the ten- 
der passion, on the part of a gallant though somewhat 
elderly gentleman, is a constant source of anxiety to his 
grown-up children, who are devotedly attached to him. 

" Leigh Hunt would have delighted in Miss Tynan. He 
knew how to value high spirits in a writer, and the gayety of 
this cheerful story would have charmed him immensely." 
The Saturday Review (London, Eng. ). 



McLoughlin and Old Oregon. 

A Chronicle. 

By EVA EMERY DYE. Gilt top, with Frontispiece. 

12mo, $1.50. 

A graphic account of the movement that added Oregon 
to our possessions. 

" Mrs. Dye had rare material at hand and has used it with 
great skill and effectiveness. She has the historian's gift 
for bringing out significant events, the novelist's gift for 
vivifying characters." The Buffalo Express. 

"Mrs. Dye's narrative is not to be considered at all as 
a mere matter-of-fact account of the pioneering days, for it 
deals largely with the personal history of the many men 
and women concerned in the incidents described, and the 
author often lingers, gracefully and entertainingly, it must 
be admitted, on matters of amatory significance." The 
New York Times Saturday Review, 

The Dread and Fear of Kings. 

By J. BRECKINRIDGE ELLIS. 12mo, $1.25. 

The period of this romance is the beginning of the 
Christian era, and the scenes are laid in Rome, the island 
of Capri, and other parts of Italy. The interest of the 
love story, the exciting incidents, and the spirited dialogue 
enchain the attention of the reader. 

" For stirring adventure and romantic love scenes one 
need go no further. Mr. Ellis has written a book that will 
be eagerly read by all who like a stirring and well-told 
story." The Chicago Tribune. 

She Walks in Beauty. 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of " The Dear Irish 

Girl," "The Handsome Brandons," etc. 12mo, 

$1.50. 

"A brightly told story of Irish life, . . wholesome, 
and attractive." Saturday Evening Gazette (Boston). 

" It has much of the charm, tender, sweet, and frank, 
of the author's ' Dear Irish Girl,' and much of the fresh, 
buoyant atmosphere that we associate with the Irish 
character." The Churchman (New York). 

Back to Christ. 

Some Modern Forms of Religious Thought. 

By WALTER SPENCE. 12mo, $1.00. 

With clearness and brevity this little book presents to 
the thoughtful Christian the most important conclusions of 
recent writers on theology. 

" While endeavoring to show us the sweet reasonable- 
ness of the new theology, the author never stops to revile 
the old. . . . The charm of the book consists in its 
brevity, simplicity, strength, and fairness." The Boston 
Times. 

Man and His Divine Father. 

By JOHN C. C. CLARKE, D.D. 12mo, $1.50. 

This is the latest treatment of Biblical philosophy from 
the point of view of the conservative theologian. 

" It presents a conservative theology in a form strongly 
marked by individual independence. . . . Dr. Clarke 
comes close to the truth, unrecognized in the creeds, in 
holding that the central fact in the atonement is in the 
complete union of Jesus' life with the lives of men."

Uncanonized. 

A Romance of English Monachism. 

By MARGARET HORTON POTTER. 12mo, $1.50. 

The monastic life of England in the thirteenth century 
and the political conditions of the momentous reign of 
King John are here set before us with the utmost clear- 
ness. Every character that appears in the course of the 
story is portrayed with artistic skill ; and the principal 
figure that of Anthony Fitz-Hubert, son of the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, the courtier turned monk to save his 
father's soul is one, it may confidently be said, which the 
reader will never forget. 

Few will lay down this novel without feeling that a new 
force has appeared in American letters. The power and 
originality of the conception and treatment of the principal 
character will enter for the author a strong claim to a place 
among the thoughtful writers of to-day, while such analysis 
of character and breadth of historic imagination as are 
found here are things rare in literature. 

The Cobbler of Mimes. 

By MARY IMLAY TAYLOR, author of On the Red 
Staircase," "The Cardinal's Musketeer," etc. 
12mo, $1.25. 

A delightful tale of love and heroism in the days when 
the Huguenots of Langnedpc waged their desperate fight 
for liberty of conscience against the tyranny of Louis XIV. 
The hero of the story is a little humpbacked cobbler, whose 
unprepossessing exterior covers a magnanimous and loving 
soul, and who sacrifices his life to save the lady he adores 
and the man she loves. The historical incidents are subor- 
dinated to the interest of a fascinating character-study and 
a story of love touched as if with the purity and freshness 
of a summer morning. 

Battling for Atlanta. 

(The Young Kentuckians Series.) 

By BYRON A. DUNN, author of " General Nelson's 
Scout," "On General Thomas's Staff." Illus- 
trated. 12mo, $1.25. 

The brilliant campaign in which the Union forces under 
General Sherman encountered the Confederate forces, com- 
manded at first by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, and later by 
General Hood, is portrayed in much detail and in an in- 
tensely interesting manner by Mr. Dunn in the third 
volume of the Young Kentuckians Series, entitled " Bat- 
tling for Atlanta." At this time Fred Shackelford, a mere 
youth in " General Nelson's Scout," and only a little older 
in " On General Thomas's Staff," is now a young man of 
twenty-one ; and, fitly enough, an affair of the heart, in 
which a charming daughter of the Confederacy is the party 
of the second part, cuts a considerable figure in the present 
volume, though there is also sufficient adventure and fight- 
ing to please young people. 

Northern Georgia Sketches. 

By WILL N. HARBEN. 16mo, $1.00. 
Mr. Harben's stories are eagerly sought by the leading 
periodicals. This volume contains some of his choicest 
work, in which the delightful quality of his humor and 
pathos and his clever handling of plot provide a rare treat 
for the reader. The stories have a permanent interest, in- 
asmuch as they depict very interesting phases of social life 
that are rapidly disappearing. This end, however, they 
attain indirectly, for Mr. Harben writes purely as a ro- 
mancer whose aim is to give artistic pleasure to his readers. 



The Private Memoirs of 
Madame Roland. 

Edited, with an introduction, by EDWARD GILPIN 

JOHNSON. Illustrated. Gilt top, deckel edges. 

12mo, $1.50. 

Madame Roland's attractive personality, her brilliant 
intellect, her desire to be regarded with admiration by 
posterity, her enthusiastic devotion to republicanism, her 
disappointment on seeing the deeds done by the French 
Revolutionists in the name of Liberty, and her condemna- 
tion to the guillotine are here set forth in her own words in 
the form of personal reminiscences. The editor's intro- 
duction enables the reader to comprehend the whole situa- 
tion and to appreciate this intensely interesting book. 

The present work is based upon a translation made from 
Bosc's original edition of the Memoirs, and published at 
London within two years after Madame Roland's death by 
the guillotine. It is the first English translation published 
since the above-named, and now very scarce, English 
edition. 

The Handsome Brandons. 

By KATHARINE TYNAN, author of " The Dear Irish 
Girl," " Oh, What a Plague Is Love ! " " She 
Walks in Beauty," etc. Illustrated. 12 mo, $1.50. 
The Handsome Brandons are an Irish family whose de- 
cayed fortunes have no power to obscure their inbred love- 
liness of character. The affection which unites these 
brothers and sisters communicates itself to Miss Tynan's 
readers, and they feel as if privileged in being introduced 
to beings so pure and good and kind, while the satisfaction 
which they experience in witnessing the happy outcome of 
the sisters' love affairs is akin to a personal joy. In this 
story Miss Tynan is in her happiest mood ; the humor, the 
tenderness, the pathos with which she is so richly gifted, 
are found here in fullest measure. 

The King's Deputy. 

By H. A. HINKSON. 12mo, $1.50. 

This is a very spirited and dashing story of life at the 
Vice-Regal Court in Dublin toward the close of the 
eighteenth century. The dialogue is lively and witty. In- 
cluding the Duke of Rutland and Mr. Grattan, many real 
personages figure in the tale, and the picture of the times 
is realistic and truthful. The story is unusually full of 
incident and adventure, and the reader's attention is not 
allowed to flag for a moment. 

"Mr. Hinkson has caught the spirit of the time and the 
genius of the country in ' The King's Deputy.' It is a fine, 
dashing story, full of true Irish wit and gallantry." The 
Speaker, London, Eng. 

North Carolina Sketches. 

Phases of Life where the Qalax Grows. 

By MARY NELSON CARTER. 16mo, $1.00. 
Most readers of these sketches will feel as if they had 
learned for the first time of a new people. So unique are 
the social characteristics of these mountain folk that it is 
hard to realize that we are reading of citizens of the United 
States in the nineteenth century. Mrs. Carter paints from 
life ; she does not seek to idealize, but her descriptions do 
not fail to reveal, under the unlovely externals of every-day 
life, the kindly emotions that make the whole world kin. 
The novel-reader, the student of social conditions, and the 
historian will all find their own in this work.

With 12 Plates and 14 Illustrations in the Text by A. D. 

McCoKMiCK. 8vo, $3.50. 

*#* The downland district described in this work is that 
of Southern England the great Sussex range of chalk hills 
extending from Pevensey westward into Hampshire. It 
contains the author's impressions of nature, the people, and 
some of the more interesting villages he stayed at, and is to 
some extent a personal narrative, but it also treats fully of 
the natural history and flora of the district. 

" Mr. Hudson has exceptional qualities for writing this kind of book, 
and the best of them is that he is perfectly genuine. He naturally 
writes well, and is never labored or affected in his nature pictures, 
and his mind is richly stored with the lore both of nature and of 
books. " Literature. 

WAR AND LABOUR. 

By MICHAEL ANITCHKOW. 8vo, pp. xii.-578, $5.00. 

" This book is divided into three parts, each of which will 
be found of real value to those who study questions of war 
and peace. (1) The prospect of energetic co-operation be- 
tween nations with a view to establishing free frontiers, by 
means of which, according to Michael Anitchkow, peace can 
be better served than by additions made to armaments. 

(2) The causes of contemporary international antagonism. 

(3) The free trade and labor questions at the present time, 
and other matters too numerous to indicate in a single para- 
graph. The opinions of famous economists of all nations are 
submitted to searching analysis, till, by logical progression, 
the author destroys the theory that war will kill war, con- 
tinuing with the statement in uncompromising terms of his 
belief that perpetual peace is by no means a visionary ideal."

many, and the friendship of not a few of the most celebrated 
men of his time. The story of the rest of his life, spent 
mainly in South Australia, where he achieved considerable 
distinction in colonial affairs, is told by the editor with the 
help of reminiscences and letters contributed by Mrs. Pearson 
and by some of Mr. Pearson's surviving friends.

MASTER CHRISTIAN 

1 IS NOW READY. >r ' 

It is one of the most remarkable books of recent years 

BY 

MARIE CORELLI T 

In vigor of style, in boldness of conception, in tenderness and 
pathos, and in its wide appeal, THE MASTER CHRISTIAN 
presents features of extraordinary interest. It is impossible to 
sketch the outlines of this romance, and it is enough to say that 
it deals with the great problems of humanity and religion, the 
eternal struggk between the spirit and the flesh. */ln allegory of 
striking beauty runs through the hook. 

It will appeal with great attraction to the Roman Catholic, to 
the Anglican, to the Nonconformist, to the agnostic, and to the 
bigot; to the worldling as well as to the religious.

THE FOURTH GENERATION. 

By SIR WALTER BESANT. 

Author of "All Sorts and Conditions of Men," etc. 

The motif of this, a romance of modern days, is the ap- 
parent injustice in the visitation of the father's sins upon the

THE 



BACILLUS OF BEAUTY. 

By HARRIET STARK. 

A novel with a fresh and unhackneyed plot and treat- 
ment. It is like nothing else ever printed. It tells the story 
of a young girl from the West who is made the subject of an 
experiment by a Professor in Barnard College, which trans- 
forms her into the most beautiful woman in the world. 

Beauty proves a key to the smart world, and for a time the 
houses of the rich are as familar to her as the studios and

been.

WOUNDS IN THE RAIN. 

War Stories by STEPHEN CRANE.

ice," etc. 

A brilliant and thrilling work in the best vein of one who 
has been called by Robert Barr, "The greatest modern

jurymen.

ROBERT ORANGE. 

By JOHN OLIVER HOBBES. 

Author of " The School for Saints," etc. 

" This new novel by John Oliver Hobbes is a triumph of in- 
tellectual creativeness, and it has held me captive from cover 
to cover." Clement K. Shorter, in " The Sphere." 

" * Robert Orange ' is a sequel to ' The School for Saints,' 
and a worthy sequel; but it may be read very well as a single 
production, and so read it will produce an abiding impression 
on any thoughtful mind. ' "Robert Orange ' is an eminently 
religious book, but it is conspicuously bright; it is political, but 
it is also witty; it is philosophical, but it is also shrewd; it is 
an artistic collection of character studies, but they are all human 
and nearly all of individual type; but it has action also." 
"Country Life." 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 



CONSEQUENCES. 

By EGERTON CASTLE. 

An exciting romance by the author of "The Light of Scar- 
they," etc. Distinguished by verve, by close and wide ob-

not least in the striking end, decidedly original.

Author of " Tekla," " The Mutable Many," etc.

experimented with most of the communal ideas discussed in 
this work. The book, in consequence, is always fresh and 
interesting 

12mo, cloth $1.50 

LOVE AND MR. LEWISHAM. 

By H. G. WELLS. 

Author of " The War of the Worlds," etc. 

A novel by this well-known author in an entirely new field. 

A subtle, delicate, and dainty story dealing with the pas- 
sion of love. 

The London Morning Post speaks of it as "a work of 
genius," while the Daily Telegraph says it " will be consid- 
ered by many the most fascinating piece of work that Mr. 
Wells has done." Literature says: "The handful of vivid 
human figures belong to a great extent to the world of South 
Kensington students, and into that often purposeless and 
sordid background Mr. Wells weaves the poetry of life and 
the beauty of human love."

JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS 

Who bos already created one of the few imperishable figures in American 
literature "Uncle !{emw," gives us another irresistible character in bis 

new book, "ON THE WING OF OCCASIONS." Here is the 

way the old Georgia countryman, Mr. Bitty Sanders, greets President Lincoln, 



whom he has come to kidnap: 

" Well, Mr. President, I jest come on my 
own hook, as the little boy said about the cow 
in the garden," Mr. Sanders hastened to 
say. 

" Take seats, all of you," remarked Mr. 
Lincoln, cordially. Then he turned to Mr. 
Sanders, " What about the little boy and the 
cow ? " 

u Why, one Sunday a little boy was set to 
mind a gap in the gyarden fence. A panel had 
blown down in the night, and it couldn't be 
mended on account of Sunday. So the little 
boy was set to mind it. When the folks got 
home from church the cow was in the gyarden, 
and the little boy was settin' on the door-steps 
snifflin'. His mammy says, c Why, honey, 
what in the world is the matter ? The gyarden 
is ruined. How did the cow git in ? ' l She 
run her horns under my jacket an' flung me a 



somerset,' says the little boy. ' I see,' says 
his daddy, 4 she got in on her own hook.' 
The daddy thought he had got off a good joke, 
but nobody seed the two p'ints, an' this made 
him so mad that he went into the house an' 
loaded his gun wi' a piece of fat bacon, an' 
fired it right at the cow's hindquarters. She 
curled her tail an' run off smokin'. They say 
you could smell fried meat in that neighbor- 
hood for the longest." 

Mr. Lincoln clasped his hands behind his 
head, and laughed a hearty, contented laugh. 

Mr. Awtry regarded Mr. Sanders with a 
puzzled expression. " Did you say the joke 
had two points ? " he asked. 

" Why, certain an' shore," responded Mr. 
Sanders, with alacrity. " You've seed cows, 
maybe, wi' no horns, but you never seed one 
made like a rhinossyhoss."

Words That Burn 

A 20th Century Novel. 

By LIDA BRIGGS BROWNE. 

Price, $1.50. 

Dealers can sell for less. Copyrighted 1900. 

This story has over twenty prominent characters, and the 
scenes are laid both in England and in the United States. 
Sir William Percival, a haughty nobleman, disinherited his 
daughter for marrying an American whom she loved, and 
spoke words which in later years burned deep into his soul. 
His son disobeyed his command and crossed the ocean to visit 
his sister, who lived in New York City. On shipboard he 
met a wealthy Colorado mine owner, wife and daughter. 
He fell in love with the young lady and later on went to 
Denver, where the young couple were happily married. 
Some fine descriptions of western life and scenery are given, 
and the reader is taken to the top of Pike's Peak and down 
into a mine. Places in and around New York City, on the 
Hudson, in Chicago and Denver, are vividly described. 
Scenes in London, and at Percival Hall, in Somersetshire, 
Eng., are also woven into the narrative. 

The story is progressive, shows the effect of mind over the 
body, and will instruct as well as interest and please. 

Will fill all orders accompanied by New York draft or 
money order at 50 per cent off or 75 cts. each, delivered free.

THREE NEW BOOKS 

OF UNUSUAL CHARACTER AND INTEREST. 

THE DUKE OF STOCKBRIDGE. 

A ROMANCE OF SHAY'S REBELLION. By EDWARD BELLAMY, 
author of " Looking Backward." 382 pp., illus. $1.50. 
This stirring novel, written just before the book that made 
its author famous, has the intense interest of a dramatic 
romance and the keen insight into the problems of the day 
which distinguished "Looking Backward." It deals with 
an episode of American history about which too little is 
known: the revolt of the debtor farmers of Massachusetts 
against their oppressive creditors and the cruel courts, in 
1786; and is full of historic and literary power. 

THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT WOOD. 

By CHARLES Q. D. ROBERTS, author of "The Forge in the 
Forest," " By the Marshes of Minas," etc. (In press.) 
A realistic romance of the folk of the forest of the peace 
alliance between a pioneer's daughter in the depths of the 
ancient wood and the wild beasts that came under her spell. 
The human element is strongly individualized, while the 
animals as character creations are among the most real dra- 
matis personse to be found in literature. The story in itself 
is entrancing. 

THE WALL STREET POINT OF VIEW. 

A BUSINESS MAN'S BOOK BY A BUSINESS MAN. By HENRY 

CLEWS. 306 pp., with portrait. $1.50. 

Wall street in itself; in connection with the Government; 
with Social Problems; with International Affairs this is the 
ground covered by the famous Wall street broker, who knows 
his subject through and through, and handles it with marked 
good sense, judgment and native ability.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... 184 
(A classified list of 1,700 titles announced for publi- 
cation during the coming season.) 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

Our annual autumn list of the publications 
announced for the coming season is this year 
even longer than ever before, although last 
year set a standard that seemed unlikely to be 
exceeded for some time, and although the 
excitement attendant upon the political orgy 
in which our country quadrennially indulges 
might reasonably seem to exercise a modifying 
influence upon the plans of the publishers. 



But in spite of the record of other years, and 
in spite of the distractions of a Presidential 
campaign, it seems that we are to have more 
books this year than ever before, and we may 
add that the proportion of promising announce- 
ments, of books that are to be awaited with 
eagerness, is quite as large as it has been at 
the opening of any past season. It is the 
purpose of the present article to indicate a few 
a very few only of the works that are 
likely to prove most attractive to readers and 
collectors in general. 

If there is such a thing as " the book of the 
year " in the present list, it is probably the two- 
volume biography of Thomas Henry Huxley, 
that has been prepared by Mr. Leonard 
Huxley, his son. Huxley was so much more 
than a mere man of science, he was a philoso- 
pher and humanist in so large a sense, that the 
story of his life is likely to be found equal in 
interest to that of any of his great Victorian 
contemporaries. Those who are familiar with 
his miscellaneous writings know that he touched 
nothing that he did not adorn with his humor, 
his argumentative appeal, his apt allusiveness, 
and his heightened sense for good literature as 
well as for sound logic. The story of such a 
life cannot fail, when told at length, to prove 
both instructive and fascinating. Standing at 
the head of the biographies of the year, this 
work, however, will by no means stand alone. 
It will be accompanied by important biogra- 
phies of Coventry Patmore, James Martineau, 
and Francis Parkman, by the intensely inter- 
esting autobiography of Mr. Stillman ("which 
recent readers of the "Atlantic" have followed 
with so much interest), and by such works of 
the pictorial type as Mr. Mabie's Shakespeare, 
and the two treatments of Cromwell by Mr. 
Theodore Roosevelt and Mr. John Morley. 
The latter work will be welcome indeed, for it 
is far too long since a new book by Mr. Mor- 
ley has made its appearance, and we are glad 
to know that his hand has not lost its cunning 
during these years of preoccupation with the 
problems of practical politics. We may also, 
perhaps, mention under the present heading 
the forthcoming book by Mr. Howells, entitled 
" Literary Friends and Acquaintances," which 
will be both biography and autobiography, 



168 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



both in a fragmentary but genial way. Frag- 
mentary and genial also, doubtless, will be the 
volume of Major Pond's reminiscences of the 
famous men and women of the platform and 
stage whom he has known in his long career 
as manager, which will be published under 
the title " Eccentricities of Genius." There 
will be interest in the forthcoming life of 
Henry George, by his son ; and in the comple- 
tion, in two additional volumes, of the late 
Augustus J. C. Hare's " Story of My Life," 
the first two volumes of which were issued 
several years ago. 

First in importance in the field of general 
literature is the long-expected " American 
Anthology " of Mr. E. C. Stedman, which, 
many times delayed and eagerly awaited, is 
now definitely promised for this season. Next 
in interest to the student of American liter- 
ature will be the ambitious "Literary History 
of America," upon which Prof. Barrett Wen- 
dell has been long engaged. The season is to 
give us some additional letters of Edward 
FitzGerald, edited by Mr. Aldis Wright ; and 
also a new life of FitzGerald by Mr. John 
Glyde. Mention of FitzGerald reminds us 
that we are to have a volume on " The Life 
and Times of Omar Khayyam," written by 
Mr. Denison Ross. Other items of interest 
in this category are a new volume of essays by 
Count Tolstoi, a study of the Sonnets of 
Shakespeare by Mr. Parke Godwin, a study of 
Milton by Mr. Walter Raleigh, and an au- 
thorized English translation of M. Rostand's 
"L'Aiglon." A noticeable feature of the 
season's announcements is the unusually large 
number of new and attractive editions of stan- 
dard works, of which space will allow us to 
mention only the edition de luxe of the works 
of Walter Pater, in eight sumptuous volumes ; 
the novels of Charles Kingsley, edited and 
supplied with introductions by his son, Mr. 
Maurice Kingsley; the "Knickerbocker" edi- 
tion of Lord Macaulay, in 20 volumes ; a com- 
plete edition of George Borrow's works, edited 
by Professor Knapp and others ; and a popular 
seven-volume edition of the writings of Col. 
T. W. Higginson. 

Among works of scholarship, the first place 
must be given to the " General History of 
Modern Times," which has long been prepar- 
ing under the editorship of Lord Acton. This 
great enterprise, which has enlisted the most 
eminent scholars in its preparation, will extend 
to twelve volumes, the first of which, " The 
Renaissance," is now announced as ready for 



publication. Another highly important co- 
operative enterprise is the " World " series of 
descriptive geographies, edited by Mr. J. H. 
Mackinder, of which the first two volumes 
will appear at once. Still another large col- 
lective undertaking is the " Dictionary of 
Philosophy and Psychology," in three volumes, 
edited by Professor James Mark Baldwin, 
which is now nearly ready to see the light. A 
few more titles of important works, taken 
somewhat at random, are " Studies in History 
and Jurisprudence," by Mr. James Bryce ; 
"Introduction to English Politics," by Mr. 
John W. Robertson ; " A Century of Amer- 
ican Diplomacy," by Mr. John W. Foster, 
our foremost living diplomatist ; " Italian 
Cities," by Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Blashfield; 
" The Ascent of Mount St. Elias," by the 
Duke of Abruzzi ; " Pompeii," by M. Pierre 
Gusman ; " Through the First Antarctic 
Night," by Dr. Frederick A. Cook ; " The 
Harriman Expedition to Alaska" ; and " The 
Problem of Asia," by Captain A. T. Mahan. 
There are to be no end of books about China 
and the new Eastern question, but none of 
them will be likely to equal in weight and 
influence this work of Captain Mahan. Interest 
in Eastern affairs has of course eclipsed for 
the moment events in South Africa ; but we 
are to have a number of new volumes on the 
Boer war, the most important of which are 
Richard Harding Davis's " With Both Armies 
in South Africa," Dr. A. Conan Doyle's 
" History of the South African War," and 
Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill's account of 
" Ian Hamilton's March." 

Among the more sumptuous art publications 
we find two elaborate volumes devoted to the 
work of Van Dyck, one by Mr. Lionel Gust, 
the other unsponsored ; an account of " Bot- 
ticelli and his School," by Count Plunkett ; a 
life of Sir Joshua Reynolds, by Sir Walter 
Armstrong ; and a " Life of Lord Leighton," 
by Mr. Ernest Rhys. These promise to be 
works of permanent value, although clad in 
holiday raiment ; of holiday books in the 
stricter sense, so many are announced that we 
give up in despair the attempt to make any 
selection at all. 

Our list is fairly swamped with works of 
fiction, and the task of selecting a few of the 
many titles offered is peculiarly invidious. 
The following have caught our attention as 
among those most deserving of mention : 
" The Lane That Had No Turning," by Mr. 
Gilbert Parker ; " The Palace of the King,"

Humphry Ward. The announcements in 
poetry, although not unnumerous, are of such 
very minor importance that it seems hardly 
worth while to specify any of them. We look 
in vain for the volume by Mr. Swinburne 
which some recent notes in the English jour- 
nals had led us to expect this fall. 



THE MENTAL PROCESSES OF 
ANIMALS. 



In a Monograph Supplement to " The Psycho- 
logical Review," Volume II., No. 4, Dr. Edward L. 
Thorndyke presents a series of experiments on the 
mental processes of animals, and his conclusions 
based thereon. So profoundly convinced is he of 
the finality of these conclusions, as well as of the 
uselessness of any but experimental studies, that he 
does not hesitate to declare himself as follows : 

" Surely everyone must agree that no man now has a right 
to advance theories about what is in animals' minds or to 
deny previous theories unless he supports his thesis by sys- 
tematic and extended experiments." 

He is, moreover, particularly severe on those be- 
lated persons who think that the lower animals 
i. e., those below man reason. After admitting 
that both such men and their opponents have thus 
far based their belief on mere opinions, he says : 
" So, although it is in a way superfluous to give the coup de 
grace to the despised theory that animals reason, I think it 
worth while to settle this question once for all." 

In the quotations given above, it will be observed 
that Dr. Thorndyke first denies the right of any 
one not of the experimental school, even though a 
naturalist who has devoted many years to the study 
of animals in their normal surroundings, to enter 
into the discussion at all after the advent of his 
( Dr. Thorndyke's) work ; and then all parties are 
notified that the coup de grace has been given to 
" the despised reason theory." 

Against both of these positions I desire to enter 
a protest. I must at the outset, however, confess 
to a sincere admiration for the ingenuity and care 



exhibited by Dr. Thorndyke in the devising of ex- 
periments and for his patience in carrying them 
out and tabulating the results. Although the pur- 
pose of this article renders it necessary to criticise, 
to some extent, these experiments, it should be un- 
derstood that such criticisms are not inconsistent 
with a sincere appreciation of the many admirable 
features that could easily be pointed out. The gen- 
eral method of experimentation was as follows : 

" It was merely to put animals when hungry in enclosures 
from which they could escape by some simple act, such as 
pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a 
platform. The animal was put in the enclosure, food was left 
outside in sight, and his actions observed." 

The author further explains that " so far as possible 
the animals were kept in a state of hunger, which 
was practically utter hunger." 

It might be suggested that imprisonment in a 
box while suffering from the pangs of utter hunger 
is not likely to result in the best mental conditions 
for the exhibition of normal mental activities, and 
that conclusions drawn from the conduct of such 
animals might justly be relegated to the limbo of 
" Abnormal Psychology." Can we wonder that 
under these conditions " there was displayed no ob- 
servations of the surroundings or deliberations upon 
them?" The author remarks that "the cat does 
not look over the situation, much less think over 
it." This conclusion appears to be entirely gratui- 
tous, and it seems not unlikely that the unfortunate 
animal would be doing a deal of thinking which 
might take some such form as this : " This is most 
unpleasant, and I will try every means in my power 
to get out at once." And then it would do exactly 
what Dr. Thorndyke says it does when he reports 
that it " bursts out at once into the activities which 
instinct and experience have settled on as suitable 
reactions to the situation." I imagine that a boy 
similarly treated would act in a similar manner, and 
not necessarily without reason. 

It may fairly be maintained, I think, that these 
experiments are negative in their results, so far as 
proof of reason is concerned. They neither prove 
reason nor the absence of reason. Similar experi- 
ments with human beings, even though attended by 
similar conduct, would not prove the absence of the 
power to reason. The boy above referred to might 
be able to solve an equation when not mentally per- 
turbed by imprisonment or fear, and physically 
deranged by utter hunger. 

Those who believe that the higher mammals 
reason have, it seems to me, a perfectly logical 
ground for that belief. Nothing beyond an outline 
of the argument can be given here, but even this, it 
is hoped, will show that the coup de grace has still 
to be given to the despised " reason " theory. 

It is almost an axiom among biologists that 
closely similar organs in animals that are zoologi- 
cally closely related, as are all of the higher mam- 
malia, are similar in function, and that the greater 
the similarity in structure the greater the similarity 
in function. Taken in general, the organs in the 



170 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



cat, for instance, are so similar to corresponding 
structures in man that their activities are not only 
inferred but known to be similar in kind, although 
perhaps differing greatly in degree. Not only is 
this true, but also the highly significant fact that 
similar stimuli result in similar reaction, showing 
not only structural but physiological likeness be- 
tween the nervous systems of the two. Drugs and 
medicines, in general, have the same effect on both, 
in witness whereof stands practically the whole 
mass of facts accumulated by the experimental phy- 
siologists. Now this similarity in kind is no less 
true of the brain than of other organs. This being 
a matter of prime importance to my argument, I 
have sought expert testimony. 

Professor G. L. Houser, a specialist in brain 
structure and head of the Department of Animal 
Morphology in the State University of Iowa, has 
the following to say concerning the fundamental 
similarity between the brain of man and of the 
order Carnivora, to which the mammals experi- 
mented upon by Dr. Thorndyke belong : 

"The brain of the higher Carnivora may be compared 
with the human brain without disclosing any essential differ- 
ence either in external characters or in internal structure." 

Recently the claim has been made that an import- 
ant difference between the brain of man and other 
animals is found in the " association tracts," which 
are supposed to have to do with the transmission of 
impulses between different parts of the brain. At 
my request, Dr. Henry H. Donaldson, head of the 
Department of Neurology in the University of Chi- 
cago, permits me to quote him as follows : 

" In the cerebrum of vertebrates, so far as the cortex is 
developed, there appear to be always present cells which we 
can fairly assume to be concerned in passing nerve impulses 
from one part of the cortex to another. This is physiologi- 
cally the process of association. It doubtless is very poorly 
developed in the lower orders, but it is essentially the same 
arrangement as is found in the cortex of man himself . . . ." 
"The possibility of this physiological linking of different 
portions of the cortex is not to be confused with the presence 
or absence of so-called association fibres, which are defined in 
anatomical terms only." 

In regard to these association fibres, there is no 
question, I believe, about their being found in all 
the higher Mammalia. 

It is admitted that the brain is the physical 
organ, the activities or functions of which are in- 
volved in mental phenomena. We are therefore 
justified in taking the position that these similar 
organs have similar functions in the man and in the 
cat. In other words, their mental activities are 
similar, and do not differ in kind, however much 
they may differ in degree ; and we confidently 
assert that this similarity in function appears to 
extend to the function or power of reasoning. 
That the higher mammals appear to reason is a 
proposition that few naturalists would care to deny. 
Almost anyone who has had an intimate acquaint- 
ance with animals would agree to the statement 
that they exhibit activities which would unhesitat- 
ingly be ascribed to reason if exhibited by human 



beings. Dr. Thorndyke, to be sure, denies that his 
animals even appeared to reason ; but his testimony 
is far outweighed by the repeated observations of 
the great majority of those naturalists who have 
given most attention to the mental activities of 
animals. 

Now there are no possible criteria whereby we 
can interpret the mental activities of other organ- 
isms than our own, save those furnished by our own 
mental states. These criteria may be wrong, but 
they are absolutely our only resource. In other 
words, we are forced to interpret the acts of ani- 
mals in terms of our own consciousness, or else not 
to interpret them at all. Ours is the only mind 
with which we are acquainted at first-hand, and 
those acts which with us are accompanied by certain 
mental states must be assumed to be accompanied 
by similar mental states in animals with similar 
brains, until the contrary is proved. The burden 
of proof is thus brought to rest upon those who deny 
to the lower animals the power to reason. 

The argument which I have thus briefly sum- 
marized can be outlined as follows : 

Dr. Thorndyke's experiments were by their 
nature such as to interfere with the normal mental 
activities of his subjects, and even if they were 
valid his results were negative, so far as reason is 
concerned. 

The demonstrated similarity between the anat- 
omy and physiology of man and the higher mam- 
mals, extending as it does to the brain and its 
minute structure, gives us a logical right to expect 
mental activities similar in kind, however great the 
difference in degree. This similarity in brain 
structure is actually accompanied by activities that, 
in us, would be at once regarded as the outcome of 
reason. It is therefore logical to assume that reason 
is an attribute of at least some minds of animals 
lower than man. Furthermore, this assumption 
holds good until proof to the contrary is forthcom- 
ing, and it is from the nature of the case almost 
impossible to prove such a negative so long as any 
animals even appear to reason. 

It will be seen that I have not as yet attempted 
to define reason. For the purposes of this discus- 
sion I am willing to accept Dr. Thorndyke's defini- 
tion which is implied in the question : " Do they 
[animals] ever conclude from inference that a 
certain act will produce a desired result, and so do 
it?" I am willing to assert that they appear to do 
so, and that is all that anyone is warranted in 
asserting either of the lower animals or of any 
human being save himself. 

It may be noted, in conclusion, that many 
modern psychologists would not agree with Dr. 
Thorndyke in this matter. Dr. G. T. W. Patrick, 
Professor of Psychology in the State University of 
Iowa, allows me to quote him as follows : 

"The trend of opinion among modern psychologists is 
toward the belief that the mental activities of man do not 
differ in kind from those of the higher mammalia in general. '

MONT BLANC MOUNTAINEERING.* 



Mr. Mathews's handsome volume entitled 
" The Annals of Mont Blanc " is in no sense a 
record of personal experiences, although the 
author has climbed the great mountain twelve 
times, and could hence unfold an interesting 
tale of his own adventures if he chose ; nor is 
it an account of the geological evolution and 
modification of Mont Blanc, although a special 
chapter on this subject is supplied by Professor 
T. G. Bonney. The book may be fairly de- 
scribed as a history of Mont Blanc mountain- 
eering a detailed account of the various 
ascents and attempted ascents of the mountain, 
from the early essays, in 1762, 1775, and 
1783, of Pierre Simond and others, and the 
pioneering ascents of Balmat, Paccard, and 
Saussure (1786, 1787), down to the time of 
Albert Smith (1851), when climbing Mont 
Blanc began to be regarded, not as a feat al- 
most comparable with a voyage to the Pole, 
but as a customary part of the programme 
of more adventurous Alpine tourists. Mr. 
Mathews's book is the first of its kind and 
scope in English, Albert Smith's brochure of 
fifty years ago being mainly the story of his 
own exploit, while Mr. Whymper's excellent 
" Guide to Chamonix and Mont Blanc " is a 
guide-book rather than a history. 

In reading the interesting accounts of the 
earlier ascents of Mont Blanc, one is struck 
not only with the sufferings which the adven- 
turous, and, as it then seemed, foolhardy 
pioneers actually endured, but with their very 
vivid, and as we should now think, exagger- 
ated sense of the dangers of their undertaking. 
Perhaps a remnant of the mysterious and 
legendary terrors with which the imagination 
of certain old writers, such as John Jacob 
Scheuchzer, had invested the mountain, still 
lingered about it in the days of Balmat and 
Saussure, and to the known material dangers 
of avalanches and crevasses added the grisly 
possibility of an encounter with the grim 
shapes and " beckoning shadows dire " still 
popularly believed to haunt those icy fast- 
nesses. Scheuchzer's " Itinera Alpina " (1723) 
is a most quaint book a curious medley 
of primitive scientific facts and old wives'

tales and marvels in the style of Sir John 
Maundeville, whose long bow Scheuchzer was 
quite capable of bending. A doctor of medi- 
cine and professor of mathematics at Zurich, 
John Jacob nevertheless tells us gravely in his 
" Itinera " of certain Alpine lakes that draw 
into their fatal depths men who fall asleep 
near their shores, their waters having the prop- 
erty of attracting the human body as the mag- 
net attracts iron ; of a certain blue flower, not 
that of "Novalis" but of the magic plant 
" Doronicum," which renders invulnerable the 
chamois that eats it, and which (Scheuchzer 
assures us) will do a like service to man, only 
in this case it is the root of " Doronicum," and 
not the flower, that must be eaten, and that 
before sunrise. Scheuchzer is learned in the 
habits of the chamois, which he calls " rupi- 
capra," noting among other things how the 
sagacious beast is given to " licking certain 
porous rocks in order to promote digestion." 
But it is as the discoverer of Swiss dragons 
that this Professor of Mathematics especially 
shines in the department of Natural History. 
He does not claim to have himself ever seen a 
dragon. But he establishes the fact of their 
existence to his own entire satisfaction through 
the testimony of " unimpeachable witnesses," 
and gives some instructive facts as to their 
habits, haunts, etc., together with many draw- 
ings of the monsters, as they were described to 
him by veracious informants. One of these 
pictures, reproduced by our author, shows a 
dragon in an alarming state of rampancy, and 
bearing a general family resemblance to his 
English relative of Wantley, as the cuts at the 
top of the old ballad figured him. 

Perhaps mountaineering pioneers of the days 
of Balmat and Saussure did not exactly ex- 
pect to be drawn into a magnetic lake if they 
ventured to scale unexplored heights of Mont 
Blanc, still less to be called upon to play the 
role of Saint Michael with one of Scheuchzer's 
dragons. But they had a somewhat gruesome 
antecedent notion of the terrors and perils of 
the mountain, and they were by no means in- 
clined to make light of the dangers and suffer- 
ings they had endured after making their first 
ascents. All of them complained bitterly of 
frost-bites, of snow- blindness, of blistered faces, 
of agonies resulting from breathing the rarified 
air ; and some of them were urgent in their 
advice that no one should follow their example. 
Sherwill, for instance, said : " It is in itself a 
dangerous effort. The risk of losing one's own 
life or that of the guides is too great to be in-

curred without a very important object." Sir 
Charles Fellows, who made the ascent in 1827, 
was still more emphatic. 

" Great as is the pleasure of overcoming an acknowl- 
edged succession of dangers, any one who sets the least 
value upon his own life, or upon theirs who must ac- 
company him on such an expedition, hazards a risk 
which upon calm consideration he ought not to venture; 
and if it ever falls to my lot to dissuade a friend from 
attempting what we have gone through, I shall consider 
that I have saved his life." 

Various were the motives that impelled men 
to climb Mont Blanc, in the days when the 
feat was a rare one and shed a certain glory 
upon those who performed it. Some attempted 
the ascent through pure love of adventure and 
the promptings of restless curiosity ; others for 
the sake of the positive information which the 
expedition might afford ; not a few, we fear, 
through motives akin to those which inspire 
the perennial " crank" who jumps off Brooklyn 
Bridge, " shoots " the rapids at Niagara in a 
barrel, or crosses the Atlantic in a yawl, or 
fires a pistol at somebody whose murder is 
sure to make a great stir in the world. But 
there is no great fame, or notoriety, to be 
gained nowadays through scaling Mont Blanc, 
since everybody has done it. 

" Familiarity has bred for it, not indeed contempt, 
but at least indifference. Men have climbed it without 
guides; women have climbed it; blind men have climbed 
it; a priest has said Mass [shade of the Savoyard Vicar!] 
upon its summit; it has been scaled in the depth of 
winter; Professor Tyndall slept upon the top, though 
not without much suffering; M. Vallot spent three days 
and nights there. Many a great feat has been achieved 
upon it; Mr. Frederick Morshead once climbed it alone, 
and went up and down in less than seventeen hours." 

All of which may be said without detracting 
from the fame of the gallant spirits who, im- 
pelled by the thirst for adventure and the 
ambition of adding to the sum of human knowl- 
edge, first made their way, by unknown paths 
and through unknown dangers, to the summit 
of the King of Swiss Mountains. The adven- 
tures of these pioneers are agreeably told by 
Mr. Mathews the story of Balmat's ascent 
being borrowed from Dumas (" Impressions 
de Voyage Suisse"), who took it from the lips 
of Balmat himself. The work forms a suffi- 
ciently full and very entertaining account of 
Mont Blanc mountaineering. There are special 
chapters entitled " The Formation of the Al- 
pine Club," "Fatalities," "The Chamonix 
Guides," " The Bibliography of Mont Blanc." 
An Appendix contains a " Table of Ascents 
from 1786 to 1851," a " Table of Fatalities," 
a " Letter from Jacques Balmat," etc., and 



there is a map of the routes up Mont Blanc. 
The volume is handsomely illustrated with por- 
traits, mountain views, etc., and it deserves a 
place in the bookshelves of every one inter- 
ested in its topic. E. G. J. 



A SOUTHWESTERN PIONEER.* 



As if it were not enough for one man in one 
lifetime to have given us the definitive and mon- 
umental editions of Lewis and Clark, Henry and 
Thompson, Larpenteur, and Jacob Fowler 
by much the most competent and valuable 
collection of Far- West exploration in the nine- 
teenth century (and, in English, of any cen- 
tury) two rich volumes come posthumously 
to increase, and by a very material sum, our 
debt to the late Dr. Elliott Coues. They are, 
too, his best requiem : fully worthy to close the 
long chapter of a fine and useful and lovable 
life. Though posthumous, they are no pitiful 
remnants swept up for the market, but a com- 
plete, rounded, and standard work, a sound 
staff for historical students so long as there 
shall be any, and withal eminently readable to 
the thoughtful layman. The price of this per- 
fectedness does not appear upon its face, nor 
even in the summary of enormous labor the 
book required ; for the last payment was made 
as it were in blood. Returning already marked 
for death from his last New Mexico expedition, 
Dr. Coues worked serenely, doggedly, swiftly, 
through his few months of resistance, through 
quenchless pain with quenchless fortitude, to 
round his last work. It was his and our 
good fortune that he had as collaborator the 
younger scholar upon whom, of all now in 
sight, it seems likeliest that Dr. Coues's mantle 
shall fall Mr. Frederick Webb Hodge, of 
the Bureau of Ethnology ; and between them 
the great task was completed in time. Par- 
ticularly in the admirable ethnographic foot- 
notes over his own initials, Mr. Hodge has 
added greatly to the value of these volumes. 
For concise, comprehensive, and authoritative 
reference-definition of the Indian tribes of the 
Southwest, they are hardly to be matched. It 
could be wished that Mr. Hodge were not 
officially bound to the barbarous spellings 
fathered by the Bureau " Moki " for Moqui, 
" Navaho " for Navajo, and the like, which are 
adverse to history, etymology, and an invariable

scheme of pronunciation. They are illogical 
as some other " spelling reforms," absolutely 
without system (" Englishing " a few proper 
names and leaving thousands untouched ; for 
we are not yet saddled with " Heelah " for 
Gila, nor " Santa Fay," nor " Cheewahwa ") ; 
and as wanton as it would be to write the pres- 
ent diarist " Garsace " or his editor " Cows." 
It is to be noted that Dr. Coues writes Moqui, 
Navajo, Mojave, etc., after the historic spelling. 

Decidedly second to Bandelier in critical 
knowledge of the documents, Dr. Coues was 
easily foremost of our documentary editors. 
He revived the dignity of the bedraggled term 
" popular science," so largely used for matter 
which is neither scientific nor popular. Dr. 
Coues's work was both. His broad and inde- 
fatigable scholarship was formulated in a me- 
dium peculiarly sympathetic and " taking." 
Manful, aggressive, generous, pungent, afraid 
of nothing on earth save error, he captivated 
many who intrinsically cared nothing for his 
themes. One of the best equipped and most 
vital reviewers in this country, on all topics of 
Western history this side of 1800, he was also 
one of the most competent workers therein, and 
beyond reasonable competition our foremost 
popularizing editor of " sources." 

A theme after his own heart was this import- 
ant Didrio of Fray Francisco Garces, a typical 
Franciscan missionary who, like hundreds of 
his kind, before and after, plodded by the 
hundred leagues over the burning wastes of 
New Mexico, Arizona, and the general South- 
west; penetrated savage tribes, dwelt among 
them, converted them, chronicled them, and by 
them were at last given the crown of martyr- 
dom. For centuries it was almost the regula- 
tion programme of the Great American Desert 
an educated evangelist, alone amid his bar- 
barous flock, farther from a population of his 
countrymen than the Klondiker gets to-d ay ; per- 
suading brush-housed savages to build to the new 
God they so little laid hold upon so huge and 
noble temples in wilderness and squalid ranch- 
eria as we can match only in our greatest cities 
(if at all) ; making their tongue a universal 
password through nearly a thousand diverse lan- 
guages and along more than five thousand miles 
north-and-south ; and at last, in some brute- 
childish impatience of their parishioners, hacked 
or clubbed to death for their pains. 

Garces was for thirteen years a frontier 
apostle to our Southwestern Indians. He came 
from Spain, young in years and in the vows of 
St. Francis ; and in 1768 (being then thirty 



years old) was resident priest at the frontier 
mission of San Xavier del Bac, near our mod- 
ern Tucson in Arizona. The church, set in a 
huddle of Papago hovels, is famous as the most 
notable and most noble example of old ecclesi- 
astical architecture north of Mexico. Up to 
1781 (when he was cruelly slain by his flock 
in the brutal massacre of July 1719 at the 
Puerto de 'la Purisima Concepcion, where 
Yuma now stands) Garces had made five 
evangelizing explorations through the South- 
western deserts ; covering over 1800 leagues on 
foot, visiting some 25,000 savage Indians of 
dozens of tribes, penetrating the unmapped 
wilderness as far as the mouth of the Colorado ; 
the Tulare valley, halfway up California, and 
back across to the remote Moqui villages. He 
was the first white man to cover and record a 
very considerable portion of this enormous 
itinerary. In footsore mileage he was sur- 
passed by a few, equaled by many, of his fel- 
low-missionaries ; but none of our " American " 
explorers have matched his record. He ac- 
companied that competent frontiersman and 
Apache-fighter, Juan Bautista Anza, on the 
longest and worst part of the expedition which 
founded San Francisco, the present metropolis 
of the Pacific Coast ; and left it only to make 
a far longer, far harder, and far more perilous 
journey alone to the cliff-built pueblos of 
Tusayau. He kept of all his wanderings a 
modest, matter-of-fact diary, unburdened with 
any record of his physical sufferings on a route 
the best equipped wagon-party even now could 
not duplicate without severe hardships. His 
chronicle is devoted to the topographies and 
peoples he found ; the tribal names, numbers, 
relationships, customs, and disposition to the 
Faith ; and it is of intimate importance to our 
knowledge of Southwestern ethnography. Like 
nearly all the numerous like documents of the 
pioneer missionaries and explorers, it has been 
hitherto inaccessible except to the adept ; never 
translated, and even in Spanish available only 
in the inaccurate version printed in Mexico in 
1854 and long since out of print. Historically 
precious, it was worth publicity even as a hu- 
man document. An incomplete measure of 
what Garces endured is suggested by the fact 
that the untimely death of his editor (himself 
a veteran army-surgeon of the frontier) was 
directly due to a journey in a Studebaker 
wagon, with mess, shelter, and all the ameli- 
orations of loving companionship, money, and 
a close-at-hand railroad, over something like 
one-twentieth of the Southwestern distances

Garces trudged, un-outfitted and alone, a cen-

The text of this old-fashioned traveller's 
diary is carefully " compared " with the three 
known versions, and annotated exhaustively. 
Of the more than 600 pages in these volumes, 
over half are occupied by the illuminative 
commentary. The 52-page index is perhaps 
the least complete member of the work. It 
omits the Rudo Ensayo, the Apostolicos 
Afanes, Acoma, the Cronica Serafica, and 
other vital references. 

The translation, as a whole, is scrupulously 
exact, though with some serious flaws. The 
marvel is, to those who know the field and 
knew Dr. Coues in it, that these flaws are so 
few. His acquaintance with Spanish was by 
no means intimate. Except for his natural 
and trained gift as a lexicographer, and his 
insatiable conscientiousness, the translation of 
this rather esoteric " source " must have been 
a monumental failure ; with them, it is an as- 
tonishing success. Barring a few errors which 
are not vital to the historic value of the record, 
it is admirable throughout. The astounding 
misconception (p. xxii.) of the virtue of 
Spanish accents ; a good many renderings too 
loose, and as many too " tight " but none 
essential in broad understanding of the text 
indicate how much this translation must have 
cost its author. There is a certain tang in 
retaining the Spanish words which have be- 
come (over a million square miles, at least) 
part of our vernacular like " mesa," " canon," 
" arroyo," " pueblo," and the like. To trans- 
late them nowadays would be absurd and con- 
fusing. But there is no reason why " Espan- 
oles" is better than "Spaniards," or " aguage" 
than " water-hole," or " parage " than " stop- 
ping-place " and printed without even an 
italic to show that it is par-dh-kc, and not some 
orphaned relative of " disparage." " Canal 
de Santa Barbara " is particularly needless and 
misleading for " Santa Barbara Channel." 

for las jornadas acostumbradas means not 
" by the usual route " but " by the accustomed 
stages " (Jornada, day's journey). Estamos 
buenos can no more mean " we are good " than 
it could mean "we have indigestion." It is 
the cast-iron Spanish for " we are well." The 
fanciful misapprehension of la gente (p. 230) 
is barely short of absurd ; and a very few 
other equal blunders are to be noted ; yet after 
a punctual reading I cannot recall another 
document of our Spanish-Americana on the 
whole so soundly translated. 



As for the connotation, it is Coues at his 
best. Barring a few needless and not really 
critical flings at Garces's creed, it is as masterly 
as readable. Amid the voluminous notes, per- 
haps the most broadly interesting are those 
which (in gentle humor, but strict justice) bring 
to book General Simpson's truly astounding 
blunders of " facsimile " and translation of the 
historic epigraphs of " Inscription Rock " in 
Western New Mexico. There is perhaps, in 
all our scientific annals, no deadlier example 
of the perils of guess-work. For more than 
forty years General Simpson was easily first 
among " American " students of the South- 
west, and his major premises will endure ; 
but his El Morro experience warns us to take 
an expert's word only in so far as he is expert, 
and not in his hearsay conclusions.

DEMOCRACY AND EMPIRE.* 

A timely contribution to the current dis- 
cussion of the probabilities as to the outcome 
of the American experiment in democratic 
government, and the dangers supposed to lurk 
in what is called " Imperialism " as applied to 
American policies, is furnished by Dr. F. H. 
Giddings, Professor of Sociology in Columbia 
University. Grouping together a number of 
addresses and papers prepared by him during 
recent years, he has published them in a vol- 
ume under the title of " Democracy and Em- 
pire." The series is devoted mainly to scientific 
explanations of the workings of democracy in 
various directions, the point of view being that 
of the student of sociology. There is but a 
minimum of the book devoted to a discussion 
of " Empire," only three of the twenty essays 
being apparently inspired by the recent Amer- 
ican problems concerning Expansion. But the 
entire collection of essays is pertinent to these 
problems, for it is the office of the whole to 
instruct the reader concerning the normal op- 
erations of democratic government in general, 
and of the American experiment in particular. 

The author's treatment of his subject is syn- 
thetic rather than analytic, as is natural in 
the case of a collection of papers prepared at 
different dates and for various purposes. Those 
who wish to analyze them will find him treat- 
ing of three distinct phases of the general sub- 
ject, namely: (1) Democracy subjective, its

standards and its aims ; (2) Democracy active, 
dealing with practical modern problems of life 
and government ; (3) Democracy's promises 
for the future of the United States. The mode 
of treatment throughout is scientific. The es- 
sayist searches for and elucidates the facts of 
his case ; and to these, all questions of senti- 
ment are fearlessly subordinated. It frequently 
follows that fine-spun political theories are seen 
to be devoid of substantial basis. 

Democracy being simply a society organized 
for purposes of government, Professor Giddings 
applies to its operations the same principles 
that he has found governing the movements of 
societies in general. The data furnished by 
Sociology ought to furnish a guide for the 
study of democratic government. As men 
habitually act in all ordinary associated move- 
ments, they may be expected to act when asso- 
ciating together politically. Sociology teaches 
that the element which primarily distinguishes 
humanity in society, and enables it to become 
homogeneous, to act as one, and to accomplish 
joint ends and purposes, is like-mindedness, or 
mental homogeneity. This thought recurs fre- 
quently in Professor Giddings's essays. Politi- 
cal societies, like all others, crystallize around 
a common sentiment or aggregation of opinions. 
" On no other basis can a political system rest," 
says our essayist. " There must be unanimity 
of feeling and opinion upon all fundamental 
questions of government and policy. All dif- 
ferences and contentions must be subordinate 
to the essential, fundamental unity of thought." 
A fair example of the workings of this prin- 
ciple is seen in the experience of the American 
people, in the establishment and maintenance 
of their unique form of democratic government. 

But " absolute like-mindedness would be the 
social Nirvana," says Professor Giddings. 
" What becomes, then, of progress ? Is that 
a scientific description of society which fails to 
give any account of variation ? " This part of 
the problem, also, is elucidated by our essayist. 
A like-minded society may be progressive, and 
new feelings and thoughts and purposes may 
be introduced to the extent that they can be 
assimilated into and made part of the homo- 
geneity without destroying it entirely ; leaven- 
ing the mass without causing it to explode. 
For a near example of a historical process illus- 
trative of this part of his thesis, our author 
might have referred to the action of the fathers 
of the republic. They were at once conserva- 
tive and progressive. They were like-minded 
in their devotion to local self-government. The 



novel feature of a strong national government 
federating together thirteen States and thereby 
preserving and more fully developing local self- 
government, has now become fully assimilated; 
and a larger, broader, and stronger homo- 
geneity is now the distinguishing feature of 
the American democracy. 

Such is the ordinary gradual progress by 
which most of the world's great forward move- 
ments are characterized. But there is another 
form in which societies often move, the revo- 
lutionary. This is generally " an impulsive, 
unreasoning social action, like that of the 
mob." All great impulsive movements in a 
democracy are of this character. In its famili- 
arity with them, the world has often overlooked 
one of their features, namely, that when dis- 
covered they are already in operation. Both 
mobs and revolutions begin with violent and 
impulsive action by the irresponsible and ex- 
citable elements of the people. Professor 
Giddings instances the Crusades, which began, 
not with organized movements headed by great 
commanders, but with the marchings of the 
impulsive rabble under Peter the Hermit and 
Walter the Penniless. Facts such as these, 
not generally observed, mean, he says, " that, 
at the very outset, impulsive social action is 
quasi-criminal, if not altogether criminal; it 
begins with the violent acts of those men who 
are themselves least subject to control." The 
only remedy for this evil is preventive and 
anticipatory ; it is " to multiply in the commu- 
nity the number of those men who habitually 
subordinate feeling to reason," so as to pre- 
serve a large and controlling element who can- 
not be stampeded. 

Thus Professor Giddings has illustrated not 
only the statics but the dynamics of Democ- 
racy. His searching studies of its character- 
istics in both respects are in forcible contrast 
to the superficial observations of many other 
essayists. Sir Henry Maine, for instance, in 
his " Popular Government " said : " By a wise 
constitution, Democracy may be made nearly 
as calm as water in a great artificial reservoir ; 
but if there is a weak point anywhere in the 
structure, the mighty force which it controls 
will burst through it and spread destruction 
far and near." Maine skimmed lightly over 
the surface of his subject ; Giddings has 
searched its depths. 

It would be impossible in this review to ex- 
press the full value of these essays. They must 
be read at length to be fairly appreciated.

is seen to be prone are suggested again and 
again, in their application both to individuals 
and societies. The Ethical Motive, ascertained 
with reference to individuals, and traced in its 
influences, leads to and illustrates one of the 
positive doctrines of Sociology, namely, that 
the whole nature of the man should be devel- 
oped harmoniously, in all his social, political, 
and business relations. The law of true pro- 
gress in society, political or otherwise, requires 
a like development in each individual, avoiding 
all excesses of competition, rush for wealth, 
and shirking of honest toil, and seeking the 
greatest good of the greatest number. The 
Gospel of Non-Resistance, lifted out of the 
limitations set by Tolstoi and applied in its 
spirit to nations and their affairs, is found to 
promote the habit of non-aggression, and thus 
gradually to lead to the time when non-resist- 
ance will become unnecessary. The essayist 
seems to rise to the height of his great argu- 
ment in the chapter on " The Ideals of Na- 
tions," which is a comprehensive summary of 
the " Philosophy of Universal History." 

It scarcely need be suggested that Professor 
Giddings is an optimist, and in the " expan- 
sion " which distinguishes our recent national 
operations he sees merely the working of a 
force within the nation, operating, as it were, 
automatically, and therefore to be diagnosed 
as normal rather than abnormal. If this na- 
tional disposition is to be called "imperialism " 
(which term our essayist discusses with an in- 
terrogation point " ? "), it is still but a national 
trait, to be recognized, not antagonized. The 
truth, he says, is simply this : " The American 
population of seventy million or more souls is 
at this moment the most stupendous reservoir 
of seething energy to be found on any conti- 
nent." This energy cannot be confined ; it 
must have its outlet ; it may be directed and 
managed ; how worse than useless to restrict or 
control it ! If it does indeed demand the earth 
as its field, this does not merit despair. Let it 
be called " Imperialism " if it does not cease 
to be Democratic. The minute studies made 
into the statics and dynamics of American de- 
mocracy do not forbid the hope or the expec- 
tation that it may with equal success be more 
largely expanded, with the result of a " Demo- 
cratic Empire." In this sense, Professor 
Giddings betrays no fear of the operations of 
" Democratic Imperialism." It may be that 
Democracy can eliminate from the Imperialism 
of the old form everything except the vastness 
of its domain. Then we shall witness " The 



Democratic Empire " of which our essayist 
writes in his first chapter. He emulates the 
familiarity with which the Fathers of the Re- 
public, at the very time of founding our Fed- 
eral system of government, spoke of it as an 
Empire in futuro ; witness the typical demo- 
crat James Madison, who at the outset of his 
contributions to " The Federalist," saw, in his 
mind's eye, " one great, respectable, and flour- 
ishing empire." J AME s OSCAR PIERCE. 



STUDIES IN TAXATION AND GOVERNMENT.* 



Taxation, according to the late David A. Wells, 
is " the most vital question which can concern a 
citizen"; "the subject is one of transcendent im- 
portance, perhaps more universally important than 
any other that can invite public attention "; it has 
to do with " a class of transactions which, more 
than almost any other, are determinative of the 
distribution of wealth, the forms in which industry 
shall be exerted, and the sphere of personal liberty." 
Again, we read that this subject " really constitutes 
more than almost any other element the essence of 
history, and that the record of the results that have 
followed the attempts to establish almost every 
form of taxation that human ingenuity can devise, 
has even in a very high degree the attraction of 
romance." This record of those attempts, encyclo- 
paedic in its range and its disregard of system, 
constitutes a very chaos of important historical and 
legal facts. How well entitled the author is to 
speak with authority on the subject of taxation is 
illustrated by the circumstance that his chapter on 
" Recent Tax Experiences of the Federal Govern- 
ment of the United States " is almost wholly auto- 
biographical, dealing with his own work as Chair-

man of the Revenue Commission and Special Com- 
missioner of the Revenue from 1865 to 1870 ; 
while the germ of another part of the work may be 
found in the reports of the New York Tax Com- 
mission of 1870-72, of which he was Chairman. 
Yet Mr. Wells was unorthodox in his fundamental 
theory of taxation, conceiving taxes to be " the 
compensation which persons and property pay the 
State for protection," or " the equivalent for the 
protection which the Government affords to the 
property of its citizens," and implying that they 
'should therefore be proportioned to the benefit re- 
ceived ; while most contemporary writers on taxa- 
tion reject this theory and hold that taxes should 
be in proportion to the ability to pay. It is there- 
fore rather startling to find the protection theory of 
taxation advanced as one which is " held by every 
authority," though it would not be incorrect to say 
that it persists in the popular mind, being appar- 
ently in accord with the general conception of jus- 
tice, while the acceptance of the other theory 
requires a less individualistic and more altruistic 
attitude of mind. Another theory of the author's 
which has never been generally accepted is that all 
taxes which are uniformly levied "diffuse and 
equate themselves by natural laws in the same 
manner and in the same minute degree as all other 
elements that constitute the expenses of produc- 
tion," so that upon whatever objects taxes are levied 
in the first instance, they will really be paid by all 
members of the community in proportion to their 
expenditures for consumption. 

" Every dealer in domestic or imported merchandise 
keeps on hand, at all times, upon his shelves, a stock of 
different and accumulated taxes customs, internal 
revenue, State, school, and municipal with his goods; 
and when we buy and carry away an article from any 
store or shop, we buy and carry away with it the ac- 
companying and inherential taxes." 

" All taxation ultimately and necessarily falls on 
consumption; and the burden of every man, under any 
equitable system of taxation, and which no effort will 
enable him to avoid, will be in the exact proportion or 
ratio which his aggreate consumption maintains to the 
aggregate consumption of the taxing district, State, or 
community of which he is a member." 

That this is approximately true of some taxes 
will not be denied ; but that it is equally true of all 
forms of taxation no one believes nowadays except 
Mr. Edward Atkinson, who claims the honor of 
having persuaded Mr. Wells. 

To the principal deductions which Mr. Wells 
draws from his two heterodox principles there need 
be little exception taken ; for they are simply (1) 
that property should be taxed only by the State and 
taxing district in which it is situated, and (2) that 
it is unnecessary to tax everything in order to bring 
about a just distribution of the burden. One sus- 
pects that the unnecessarily far-reaching principles 
may have been formulated in the author's mind for 
the sake of these practical conclusions. The general 
property tax of the United States, which attempts 



to tax nearly everything and taxes personal pro- 
perty wherever the owner resides, is condemned as 
" the most imperfect system of taxation that ever 
existed." Mr. Wells would limit taxation to tan- 
gible property, and perhaps to real estate ; and 
would supplement it by a tax on building occu- 
pancy, or rentals, and by taxing corporations on 
their franchises. It is unfortunate that he did not 
develop these proposals more fully, as perhaps he 
might have done if he had lived a few months 
longer; though other parts of the book would have 
been improved by condensation. After the author's 
death the duty of seeing the work through the press 
fell upon Mr. Worthington C. Ford. 

The attempt to discuss historically and philo- 
sophically the entire subject of public finance, 
"including the monetary system of the United 
States," within less than four hundred pages of 
small size, is not calculated to arouse great expec- 
tations ; but in the case of Professor Daniels' text- 
book the impression made upon the reader is one of 
surprise that the subject should be so well treated 
in so small a volume. The author is an adept in 
condensation ; and his independence and freshness 
of thought and his facility of expression combine to 
make his work interesting and perspicuous. Of 
course, the treatment is only cursory ; the part de- 
voted to " Government Outlay " contains little 
more than illustrative statistics of government ex- 
penditure, and the one hundred and fifty pages 
devoted to taxation are too few to permit a dis- 
cussion of all the taxes included in a modern fiscal 
system. A reviewer disposed to be hypercritical 
might go on to say that where the space was so 
limited there was scarcely room for a digression of 
eleven pages on the development of privately- 
owned railways, even though it led up to a discus- 
sion of government ownership more germaine to 
the general subject; and that the problems con- 
nected with railways and municipal monopolies are 
not most appropriately treated under the head of 
"Government Income." To this it might be added 
that the sources from which the author derives his 
facts are not always the most authoritative or of 
the latest possible date. The inclusion of a chap- 
ter on the currency system will not tend to lessen 
the existing popular confusion between monetary 
science and finance, but the author does succeed in 
relating this chapter to the rest of the book by con- 
sidering coinage and the issue of paper money as 
among the necessary functions of government. It 
would be hardly fair to take exception to the argu- 
ment in points of detail, because the author has not 
allowed himself space to state his positions on con- 
troverted questions fully ; so it will suffice to call 
attention to his interesting and not unsuccessful 
attempt to formulate canons of customs taxation 
applicable alike to protectionist and free-trade 
tariffs, and to his conservative attitude toward all 
proposals to extend governmental functions. On 
the railway question, for example, while admitting

that "laws limiting rates and dividends are uni-

" that a certain persistence of unjust discrimination 
as well as of competitive waste seems under present 
circumstances to be inevitable," he marshals such 
a formidable array of the evils which would follow

" Puzzles the will. 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have." 

To the series of monographs on the finances of 
particular States, appearing from time to time from 
one or another of the universities, Johns Hopkins 
contributes a collection of short studies of the tax- 
ing systems of Maryland, North Carolina, Kansas, 
Mississippi, and Georgia, written respectively by 
Dr. Thomas S. Adams, Mr. George E. Barnett, 
Mr. Elbert J. Benton, Dr. Charles H. Brough, and 
Dr. Laurence F. Schmeckebier. The five papers 
originated in informal class reports, prepared by 
the authors as students in the university, which 
proved so interesting as to make it worth while to 
elaborate and publish them. A uniform plan of 
treatment was adopted, in accordance with which 
each essay opens with a description of the economic 
or industrial characteristics of the State, followed 
in turn by a sketch of its general financial system, 
an historical account of the development of taxation, 
an examination of the various taxes now employed, 
and, finally, a critical conclusion containing sug- 
gestions for reform, and a "bibliographical note." 
The suggestions offered are uniformly conservative, 
not proposing to do away at once with the general 
property tax, whatever its faults, but only to elim- 
inate its most glaring defects and supplement it 
with other sources of revenue, such as inheritance, 
income, and general corporation taxes. It is no- 
ticeable that in four cases out of five progressive 
rates are favored. " If the several essays possess 
any particular significance, and if there be any 
unity underlying the volume," Professor Hollander 
says by way of introduction, " it is as emphasizing 
the impracticability of any universal application of 
commonly accepted principles of tax reform." 

Dr. Joseph A. Hill has made a most exhaustive 
and painstaking study of the English income tax, 
both by personal inquiries made on the ground in 
1897 for the Massachusetts Tax Commission, and 
by examination of published materials. After a 
brief historical introduction, he gives an account of 
the five schedules or divisions into which the tax is 
divided for convenience of assessment and collec- 
tion at the sources of income, and then takes up 
the machinery and process of assessment in much 
detail. Where the principle of " stoppage at 
source " cannot be applied, as in the case of income 
from trades and professions and from foreign in- 
vestments, the English income tax is subject to 
evasion much as other income and property taxes 
are ; but Dr. Hill finds good reasons for believing 
that the assessment is becoming more efficient and 
complete, and regards the tax on the whole as fairly 



satisfactory. There are features of administration 
connected with the English income tax which ought 
to prove suggestive to American legislators ; such, 
for example, as the system of supervision by in- 
spectors and surveyors of the assessments made by 
local boards, which results practically in effective 
central control without violating the principle of 
local self-government. 

The question of the relation between local and 
general finances, discussed by Mr. Sydney J. 
Chapman, is a live issue in Great Britian, and has 
occasionally been raised in this country also, as by 
the recent Massachusetts Tax Commission ; but to 
most American readers the most suggestive part of 
Mr. Chapman's book will be the discussion of the 
distribution of work between local and central 
governments, by which he approaches the fiscal 
problem. Starting from the principles that matters 
chiefly of local interest must be undertaken by 
local governments, and those chiefly of national 
interest by the central government, and that the 
distribution of functions must be made according 
to the capacities and efficiencies of the governing 
bodies, he concludes that " the matters assigned to 
local bodies should be those in which local knowl- 
edge is requisite, minute supervision essential, and 
the cooperation of private and governmental agen- 
cies likely to be of appreciable value ; and those in 
which the need for uniformity is least evident, or in 
which even diversity in administration is desirable." 

Finally, we must notice that local governments 
have a wonderful power of adapting themselves to cir- 
cumstances. By undertaking a higher quality of work 
they attract to their boards higher ability. Hence dif- 
ficult undertakings calling for tact, large knowledge, 
and perhaps some genius, which cannot at first be safely 
placed in the hands of local bodies without the most 
zealous supervision, may in a few years be wholly 
handed over to them with perfect confidence." 

As between the two ethical principles that those 
interested should bear the cost of governmental 
operations in proportion to their interests, and that 
the burden of cost should be distributed according 
to ability to bear it, Mr. Chapman decides that " in 
States approximating to confederacies, the first is 
the fundamental rule, but in those more closely re- 
sembling unitary bodies politic the second has the 
superior claim." His practical conclusions regard- 
ing State financial aid to localities are that the 
policy of subventions is a very doubtful policy at 
best, and that the existing English system is espec- 
ially unreasonable. He would much prefer a sys- 
tem of self-sufficient local taxation. 

Mr. Hugh H. Lusk, formerly a member of the 
New Zealand Parliament, has recently become 
known to the reading public of America as a con- 
tributor to the magazines and reviews. His resi- 
dence in America and his observations of social 
conditions here have led him to make certain com- 
parisions between the United States and New 
Zealand, especially as to economic tendencies and

tions ; and these studies he has published under 
the curious title of " Our Foes at Home." The 
foes referred to seem to be the landowners and 
capitalists of America, and above all the trusts, in 
which Mr. Lusk sees no possibility of good except 
the ultimate downfall he predicts for them which, 
however, is not to be brought about easily or soon, 
but only when the evil becomes so great that men 
will endure it no longer. If the author is pessi- 
mistic when writing of America, he is nothing if 
not an optimist when writing of the social experi- 
ments of New Zealand ; and it is much to be hoped 
that there is better foundation for his optimism 
than for his pessimism. At any rate, the chapters 
in which he relates New Zealand's experiences are of 
much more value than those in which he merely ex- 
presses his fears concerning America ; and it may be 
considered unfortunate that there are fewer of the 
former than of the latter. Yet many of New Zea- 
land's interesting experiments are briefly described, 
from the instructive land policy and the progressive 
tax on land to compulsory arbitration and old age 
pensions. The success of the labor legislation is 
attributed largely to the observance of two prin- 
ciples : (1) that the supervision or enforcement of 
the law must be largely or wholly committed to 
the class for whose protection it is designed, and 
(2 ) that the penalties for its violation must be such 
as appeal with special force to the class of persons 
likely to incur them. The claim that government 
ownership is unfavorable to enterprise is met by 
statistics showing that the government of New 
Zealand has built more lines of railroad per capita 
of population than the railway companies of 
America, and that the extent of telegraph lines 
and the number of messages sent are both between 
three and four times as great in proportion to 
population in Australasia as in America. In all 
New Zealand's legislative experiments, Mr. Lusk 
says in explanation of their success, the interests 
of the people as a whole were considered, and not 
those of any one class : the interests of the millionaire 
and the great land-owner were no more considered 
than those of the laboring man or of the home-seeker. 
The book contains much that is of interest, but it 
cannot be recommended as a work of reference 
because there is no index and no very serviceable 
table of contents. MAX WEST.

Brief history 
of Modern 
Spain. 



Mr. Martin A. S. Hume is well quali- 
fied by his studies of Spanish life and 
history to write the monograph on 
" Modern Spain " in the " Stories of the Nations " 
(Putnam). As is but natural in a work necessarily 
brief, attention is primarily directed toward purely 
political history, the result being a very readable 
story of wars, changes in government, and political 
intrigues from the time of Charles IV., to the pres- 
ent day. If in addition to this the author had been 



able to present concisely and impressively an analy- 
sis of those tendencies in Spanish character and in- 
stitutions which, for more than mere political events, 
have influenced the development of modern Spain, 
he would have produced a really notable book. No 
proper understanding of Spanish history is possible 
without a knowledge of the separatist and local ten- 
dencies of the provinces of Spain, of the perpetua- 
tion of old historical differences, of the distinct race 
feeling, all working against harmonious national ac- 
tion. Spain has, in fact, always lacked that sense of 
a solidarity of interests which has been so potent a 
force in creating the present day nationalities of 
Europe. Ignorant provincial jealousies have yielded 
to united effort only in resistance to an outward foe, 
stimulated by a certain pride in the hazily remem- 
bered greatness of the nation centuries ago. Of 
the political history of Spain, as given by Mr. 
Hume, there is little to be said save that it is well 
written and interesting and arranged in an orderly 
manner. The most entertaining portion of the book 
is that dealing with the character and activities of 
the Regent Christina, wife of Ferdinand VII. ; and 
here possibly the author differs from other histori- 
ans. His portraiture of Christina makes her more 
gentle, more lovable, more truly patriotic and 
womanly than other writers have pictured her. 
Her sister Carlotta, wife of the second brother of 
Ferdinand VII., is made the real factor in securing 
and maintaining the famous Frogmatic Sanction 
which inaugurated the Carlist wars. Christina is 
also acquitted of the charge of double-dealing in 
her conflict with Espartero in 1840, for, according 
to Mr. Hume, she was at least technically within 
her constitutional right in refusing to set aside by 
royal edict a law previously passed by the Cortez. 
Indeed, she could not legally do this. The contro- 
versy in question marked the beginning of an or- 
ganized liberal party in Spain, and the impress 
then given to it, and to all Spanish liberal move- 
ments, still exists in Spanish politics. The liberals 
turned to revolution and lawlessness as the shortest 
road to securing their aims, a plan readily adopted 
by the party in opposition ; so that from that time 
to this, revolution has always been a certain re- 
source in times of political discontent. Mr. Hume 
considers this readiness to appeal to riot the key- 
note to Spanish character, inbred in the spirit of 
the nation, and constituting the greatest danger to 
the proper development of the Spanish state.

Professor Flournoy first met "Mile. Smith" in

1894, and since that date has been an interested 
student of her personality and performances 
which are certainly remarkable enough even from 
the most common-sense point of view. " Mile. 
Smith " (we learn) has " no fewer than three dis- 
tinct somnambulistic romances," two of them con- 
nected with the " spiritistic " idea of previous 
existences; for it has been " revealed " that "Mile. 
Smith " has already lived twice before on this 
globe, once as the daughter of an Arab sheik and 
favorite wife of a Hindoo prince of Kanara (temp. 
1401), and again, in the last century, as Marie 
Antoinette. " Again reincarnated," says Professor 
Flournoy gravely, " as a punishment for her sins 
and [for] the perfecting of her character, in the 
humble circumstances of He'lene Smith, she in cer- 
tain somnambulistic states recovers the memory of 
her glorious avatars of old, and becomes again for 
the moment Hindoo princess or queen of France." 
Thus, let us add in plain terms, "Mile. Smith" 
is, in a sense, at one and the same time a sort of 
mental or mnemonic composite of Princess Siman- 
dini (circa 1400), "Madame Veto" (guillotined 
in 1793), and " He'lene Smith," bookkeeper for a 
Geneva firm and amateur medium for, it is fair 
to say, " Mile. Smith " takes no pay for her per- 
formances. But this is not all, for in her " third 
romance," or " Martian cycle" as the author calls 
it, "Mile. Smith," by virtue of the " mediumistic 
faculties which are the appanage and the consola- 
tion of her present life, has been able to enter into 
relation with the people and affairs of the planet 
Mars, and to unveil their mysteries to us." To the 
plain reader all this will probably seem sheer 
lunacy or sheer humbug ; but we hasten to say that 
to all who can take a serious interest in its subject- 
matter Professor Flournoy's book will doubtless 
appear as important as interesting. 

The first volume of Bailey's " Cy-

There is nothing more to be said in reference to 
the second volume, which has now appeared, further 
than that the high standard set by the first has 
been more than maintained in the second. A second 
volume, appearing at an interval after the first, is 
usually the better on account of the experience 
which the first has brought. The present volume 
begins with " Earth nut " and ends with " Myrtus," 
and contains 544 pages. The work of illustration 
continues most excellent, and the half-tones from 
photographs are fine examples of the engraver's 
art. The plate of muskmelons, for example, is 
particularly clear in detail. A timely article on

Barnes of the University of Chicago, one upon 
Fertilization, the other upon Flowers, are good ex- 
amples of the morphological standard of the work. 
They are clear and complete, and written from the 
most modern standpoint. The treatment of the 
States from the horticultural standpoint is of great 
interest and importance to many. It so happens 
that the present volume contains a goodly number 
of such papers, and among the States is Illinois, 
whose horticultural output and possibilities are 
stated by Professor J. C. Blair of the Experiment 
Station at Champaign. It is hard to see how 
those interested in plants, either from the technical 
or cultural standpoint, could find a better cyclo- 
paedia of general and accurate information than 
Professor Bailey is providing. Two more volumes

doubtless make some portions of this work antiquated

ties of its life in the formative days of our country. 
There are maps and charts, a number of pictures of 
the historic homes on the James, some reproduc- 
tions of early prints of Jamestown, and a few other 
illustrations of importance. One of the most inter- 
esting chapters is that which gives the origin of the 
names used along the river from Newport News to 
Richmond, showing how old names are retained 
long after individuals who bear them have passed 
from the scene. - 
Story of the The storming of Stony Point during 

capture of the Revolutionary war, by General 

stony Point. Anthony Wayne and selected troops 

under him, ranks among the most famous achieve- 
ments in American military annals. The difficulties 
in the way were so discouraging, the dangers were 
so great, and, on the other hand, the success attained 
was so conspicuous, that no criticism was ever made 
in the army of the Revolution, but the universal 
sentiment among soldiers and citizens alike was 
one of rejoicing. The recent purchase of the his- 
toric spot by the State of New York, as a result of 
the efforts of the " Society for the Preservation of 
Scenic and Historic Places and Objects in New 
York," seems to have been the inspiration for the 
publication of Professor Johnston's volume of over 
two hundred pages, half of them taken up with a 
study of the military situation which made the 
affair at Stony Point specially important (James 
T. White & Co.). A number of contemporary maps 
and charts help to a correct understanding of 
the skilfulness of the movements of the men in 
the difficult and dangerous night attack. The re- 
maining pages are filled with a collection of docu- 
ments, fifty-six in number, which have been 
gathered from English and American storehouses, 
furnishing abundant original material. A number 
of modern photographs, with portraits of leading 
officers, add interest to the volume. The author 
would be abundantly repaid for his careful study, 
if renewed attention to the famous assault should 
lead to the erection of a suitable monument upon 
the historic promontory. 



A book on American woman of property 

Eusinest, for upon whom, in the course of human 

American women. eveniSj ha8 devolved the duty of 

looking after her own financial interests, will find 
in Mr. John Howard Cromwell's "The American 
Business Woman " CPutnam) at once a handy 



practical manual in business methods, and a sound 
and conservative guide, philosopher, and friend, in 
the more theoretical side of the useful art of taking 
care of one's treasure in a world where moth and 
rust do corrupt, and where thieves of various sorts, 
from the sheer burglar with his "jimmy" down to 
the smooth "promoter" with his glib tongue and 
lying prospectus, do break through and steal. Mr. 
Cromwell is a member of the New York bar ; and 
he declares that in the whole course of a long pro- 
fessional experience, during which many of his 
clients have been women, he has met, or can recall, 
but one woman " whose acquaintance with regular 
business methods would, among men, be considered 
even ordinary." The state of things thus indicated 
calls aloud for a remedy ; and as a remedy we sug- 
gest a thorough study of Mr. Cromwell's carefully 
prepared book by the class for whose use it is 
written. In it will be found special chapters on 
banks and their functions and usages, savings 
banks, trust companies, safe deposit companies, 
bonds and stocks, mortgages, real property, pro- 
bate matters, the legal status of married women, 
etc. In short, the book is judiciously compounded 
of sound principles and practical directions, and 
will amply repay study. 

European literature Mr ' T ' S ' Omond's volume on The 

in the first half of Romantic Triumph" (Scribner) is 

the 29lh century. the fif th in point of pub l }cation an( J 

the eleventh in point of chronology in the series of 
" Periods of European Literature," edited by Pro- 
fessor Saintsbury. The work covers the first half of 
the nineteenth century, and does as well as one 
could reasonably expect with its practically impos- 
sible task. The first three chapters are given to 
England, and constitute about one half of the vol- 
ume. The three remaining chapters deal with 
France, Germany, and "other countries," respect- 
ively. There is also an introduction and a con- 
clusion, neither of which could be made very 
satisfactory on account of the somewhat arbitrary 
limits assigned to the period under review. Mr. 
Omond's criticisms of individual writers are nec- 
essarily brief, and they seem to us, on the whole, 
singularly just. Sometimes they are more than 
just they are exceptionally felicitous as when 
we read that " if anyone has caught up Keats's un- 
uttered song it is surely Tennyson," or when we 
are told of Shelley's later poems that " what strikes 
us is surely strength no less than beauty, masculine 
vigour wedded to ethereal grace." We have noted 
but few slips (such as "Chartreux "for "Chartreuse" 
in the title of Stendhal's famous novel) where many 
would have been easily possible. 



Education as 
an evolution. 



The name of Thomas Davidson on 
the title-page of an educational book 
is a guarantee that the work shows 
wide reading, has been well thought out, and is 
carefully written. The competent reader may not 
always agree with what the author says, but he is 



182 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



little likely to deny that the work possesses any one 
of these three qualities. Mr. Davidson's "History 
of Education" (Scribner) bears all these well- 
known marks. The author's conception of his sub- 
ject is a broad one. " Education is a. conscious or 
voluntary evolution. Hence history of education is 
a record of such evolution, and begins at the point 
where man takes himself into his own hands, so to 
speak, and seeks to guide his life towards an ever 
more definite, coherent heterogeneity, which is what 
we mean by his ideal end." Accordingly, his first 
chapter is entitled " The Rise of Intelligence," and 
the second one " Savage Education." Mr. David- 
son spreads his facts on the framework of his theory 
of the world, which is the conception of evolution, 
but evolution with God, freedom, and immortality. 
Whether by so doing he does violence to his facts, is 
a question that might lead to contradictory answers. 
The book is an able one, but in no sense elementary. 
It does not meet the needs of readers who have not 
already a considerable knowledge of the subject ; 
accordingly, only a small minority of teachers will 
read it or can read it. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In his "Myths and Fables of To-Day" (Lee & 
Shepard) Mr. Samuel Adams Drake treats entertain- 
ingly of various quaint survivals of old-time supersti- 
tions that still color our speech and even unconsciously 
influence or modify the actions of the most practical. 
Weather Lore, Charms to Good Luck, Evil Omens, 
Haunted Houses, Presentiments, the Divining-Rod, 
Fortune-telling, etc., are amusingly and learnedly dis- 
cussed, and a wealth of queer sayings and odds-and- 
ends of curious popular beliefs is presented. The pretty 
book is suitably illustrated by Mr. Frank T. Merrill, 
and should find friends. 

Mr. Frank Horridge's unpretentious volume of " Lives 
of Great Italians " (L. C. Page & Co.) contains ten 
biographical sketches, the subjects being Dante, Pe- 
trarch, Carmagnola, Machiavelli, M. Angelo, Galileo, 
Goldoni, Alfieri, Cavour, and Victor Emanuel. The 
book must be pronounced a useful one for the general 
reader who wishes to get at the essential facts about 
these great Italians, and to learn briefly in what sort 
and degree they left the world and their country in 
their debt. Mr. Horridge writes sensibly and enter- 
tainingly, and primarily for the instruction of his read- 
ers. There are eight portraits, which are acceptably 
executed, and there ought to be an index. 

That gallant sailor, Stephen Decatur, is the subject 
of a recently issued volume, by Mr. Cyrus Townsend 
Brady, in the pretty " Beacon Biographies " series 
(Small, Maynard & Co.). Even a dull pen could hardly 
make a dull book of a life of Decatur, and Mr. Brady's 
is by no means a dull pen. He has drawn upon the 
best available sources for his facts, and furnishes some 
new information as to the early history and the gene- 
alogy of the Decaturs. The handsome frontispiece por- 
trait of the dashing Commodore and the ornamental 
title-page crown the attractive make-up of this neat 
and pocketable booklet. 



NOTBS. 



" Elementary Lessons in Language and Grammar," 
by Mr. Thomas W. Harvey, is published by the Amer- 
ican Book Co. 

Two more volumes of " Stories " have been added by 
the Messrs. Scribner to their library edition of the 
writings of Mr. Frank R. Stockton. 

" Heaven's Distant Lamps," edited by Miss Anna E. 
Mack, is an anthology of " poems of comfort and hope," 
published by Messrs. Lee & Shepard. 

" The Book of Legends," told over again by Mr . 
H. E. Scudder, is a reading-book for children just pub- 
lished by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Mr. David McKay sends us a new and handsome 
edition of Whitman's " Leaves of Grass," with variorum 
readings, illustrations, and a facsimiled autobiograph- 
ical sketch. 

The Oxford University Press has won the distinction 
of a " Grand Prix " for each of its three exhibits 
(bookbinding, Oxford India paper, and higher educa- 
tional works) at the Paris Exposition. 

"The Temptation of Friar Gonsol," a little skit 
originally contributed by Eugene Field to the " Sharps 
and Flats " column of the " Chicago Daily News," is an- 
nounced for early publication in book form in a choicely- 
printed limited edition, by Messrs. Woodward and 
Lothrop of Washington, D. C. 

The Century Co. are soon to publish a sumptuous 
edition of the fairy-tales of Hans Christian Andersen, 
in commemoration of the story-teller's approaching 
centenary. The work is produced primarily under the 
auspices of the Danish government, and will be illus- 
trated by Herr Hans Tegner, who has devoted eleven 
years to his task. 

Volume III. of Miss Sarah H. Killikelly's " Curious 
Questions in History, Literature, Art, and Social Life," 
has just been published by Mr. David McKay. It pro- 
vides a singular miscellany of information upon out-of- 
the way subjects, thrown together without any pretense 
of logical arrangement, and illustrated by over a hun- 
dred full-page plates. 

"Stories of the Badger State," by Mr. Reuben Gold 
Thwaites, has been published by the American Book 
Co. It is an important addition, by a first-class au- 
thority, to the series of supplementary reading-books 
in which it appears, and the publishers are once more 
to be congratulated upon their success in enlisting the 
best American writers in this enterprise. 

" English Composition and Literature " is a text- 
book prepared by Mr. W. F. Webster, and published 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It provides for 
the systematic reading and study of a considerable 
number of literary masterpieces, most of which are ac- 
cessible in the " Riverside Literature " series. The 
suggestions for special work and the test-questions 
added to each chapter form a particularly valuable 
feature of this publication. 

Dr. Murray, in a recent lecture on " The Evolution 
of English Lexicography," makes some interesting com- 
parisons between the progress of the " New English 
Dictionary " and similar enterprises, much to the credit 
of the Oxford undertaking. The " Deutsches Worter- 
buch " of the Grimm brothers, begun in 1852, is just 
reaching the letter S. The Dutch " Woordenboek der 
Nederlandsche Taal," begun in 1852, is not yet half- 
finished. The new " Vocabolario della Crusca," starting 



1900.] 



THE DIAL

in 1863, has just reached I, and will require another 
quarter-century for its completion. Yet none of these 
works is in reality so comprehensive an undertaking as 
the " New English Dictionary." 

A new English monthly review, of the half-crown 
type, is to begin publication at once. Edited by Mr. 
Henry Newbolt, with the imprint of Mr. John Murray, 
it promises to take a conspicuous place among periodi- 
cals of its class. Its special features will include a 
serial novel, original poetry, literary criticism, illustra- 
tions, and a permanent editorial section. 

A " Victorian History of the Counties of England " is 
projected, to fill no less than one hundred and sixty large 
volumes, and to enlist the services of the most famous 
scholars. Mr. H. Arthur Doubleday is to be the gen- 
eral editor of this work, which will be published by 
Messrs. Archibald Constable & Co. The price of sub- 
scription is fixed at two hundred and forty guineas. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. announce a new and 
complete edition of Balzac in English, under the edito- 
rial supervision of Professor W. P. Trent. The edition 
will take three forms, two of them filling sixteen vol- 
umes each, the other being an edition de luxe in thirty- 
two volumes. Mr. Trent's introductions will comprise 
bibliographical matter, condensed information about the 
leading characters, cross-references, and literary criti- 
cism based chiefly upon Balzac's correspondence. The 
editor will also supply a long general introduction, and 
a " Note on the order of reading the Comedy." 

The twelfth volume, bound in handsome red covers, 
of the " Land of Sunshine " (Los Angeles) is a pleas- 
ant reminder of the steady advance of this brave little 
periodical along the difficult path of magazine enter- 
prise, of its progress not only in years but in influence 
and substantiality. The distinction it has won of being 
the best there is in periodical literature on the Pacific 
Coast is in itself much, and the " Land of Sunshine " 
has, besides, the devoted services of an editor who 
throws into it the force of an ability and an individual- 
ity powerful enough and original enough to give dis- 
tinction to any periodical. The scientific portions of 
the magazine evince the editor's scholarship and scru- 
pulous care, while the very material portions written 
by him are so fresh in style and treatment, so teeming 
with his abounding personality, that the publication 
might perhaps well be named " Lummis's Magazine." 
It is doubtless a daring thing for such a publication to 
undertake to discuss, with the frankness and vigor 
which are the mark of all Mr. Lummis's writings, cur- 
rent questions of national and universal concern ; its 
utterances must often, if not usually, be on the unpop- 
ular side, and can only be saved, and the magazine 
with them, by the absolute honesty of conviction and 
seriousness of purpose which are felt to lie behind 
them. Constituents and associates who dissent from 
Mr. Lummis's vigorous and somewhat unsparing utter- 
ances may yet respect his courage and his honesty, and 
find their compensation in seeing their region accred- 
ited by him with furnishing the best that the Pacific 
Coast has to offer in the periodical literature of the 
time. He has rendered them the immeasurable service 
of giving them a voice, and one that is listened to 
with respect and interest in all parts of the country. 
We are glad to note the constant improvement in the 
number and quality of the illustrations of this maga- 
zine, and, by no means last, the evidences of increasing 
prosperity shown in its advertising pages. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL, BOOKS. 



THE DIAL'S list of forthcoming Fall publications, 
presented herewith, is the largest of any in the history 
of the American book trade. The number of titles 
entered is 1700, against about 1600 last year. This 
list is prepared entirely from advance information 
secured especially for the purpose, and represents the 
output of 78 publishing firms : the highest number of 
titles from one firm being 200, and the average 22 for 
each firm. All the books here given are presumably 
new books new editions not being included unless 
having new form or matter ; and the list does not in- 
clude Fall books already issued and entered in our 
regular List of New Books. Juvenile books are, from 
their great number, deferred to another issue. 

The more interesting literary features of the List are 
commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue.

LINCOLN AT WORK. 

By WILLIAM 0. STODDARD. Illustrations by SEARS 

GALLAGHER. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

In a series of fascinating and most graphic chapters, Colonel 
Stoddard pictures the gaunt, ungainly politician, his rapid and marvel- 
lous rise to power, and that strange life in the White House, so appealing 
in its pathos, its quaint humor, and the profound tragedy that lay 
underneath it all. Many anecdotes are told, throwing a flood of light 
upon the times and the man. 

FROM LIFE TO LIFE. 

By Rev. J. WILBUR CHAPMAN, D.D. Illuminated cover 

design, 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

Those who have ever heard Dr. Chapman speak have been impressed 
with the large number of anecdotes, incidents, stories, poems, etc., he 
has used in illustrating his talks. This illustrative material, gathered 
from many sources and touching many topics, will prove of great 
interest and value for personal reading as well as an aid in reaching 
others. 

HOW TO WORK HOW TO PLAY 
HOW TO STUDY. 

By AMOS R. WELLS. Three hooks uniformly bound in cloth, 

75 cts. each. 

Here are three books on very practical subjects. This is a working 
nation, and yet few among its millions of workers know how to work 
to the best, advantage. " Puttering," " Putting Off," " Taking Hints," 
"'Can' Conquers," "The Bulldog Grip," are specimen titles of the 
thirty-one chapters in " How to Work. 

In "How to Play," the very first chapter is entitled "The Duty of 
Playing," which shows that the author believes in recreation. Prac- 
tical chapters are given upon such themes as how to keep games fresh, 
inventing games, overdoing it, true recreation, etc. 

In ''How to Study," such topics as concentration of mind, night 
study, cramming, memory training, care of the body, are considered. 
Many illustrations and anecdotes are given, and the author makes full 
use of his experience as a teacher and college professor.

A Sensible English Grammar. 



A Modern English Grammar. By HUBER GHAT 
BUEHLER. English Master in the Hotchkiss School. A 
presentation of the grammar of Modern English in the 
manner prescribed by modern methods of instruction. It 
begins with the sentence, the whole of Part I. being taken up 
with sentences and their structure, while the parts of speech 
are treated in Part II. 

The exposition is inductive, and omits all rubbish or useless 
matter. The exercises are practical, connecting formal 
grammar with the everyday use of language. 

"It is the only sensible book on the subject that I have ever seen." 
Professor CHARLES W. DODGE, University of Rochester. 

"His method of developing the principles is certainly clear and 
pedagogical, and so simple that the child can get the thought and 
retain it. I should consider it a privilege for my pupils to lite this 
book." J. W. TROEOEB, Superintendent of City Schools, La Grange, 111. 

" An unusual combination of good sound sense as to the essential 
principles of grammar and tact in developing them for the beginner.'* 
CHAELTON M. LEWIS, Emily Sanford Professor of English Literature, 
Yale University. 

"The book will be admired and used wherever it is known we 
shall introduce it into all our preparatory classes." THOMAS H. LEWIS, 
President Western Maryland College. 

"True to its title A Modern Grammar." H. B. HAYDEN, Supt. 
City Schools, Rock Island, 111.

" There is all the difference between an intaglio in onyx and a pencil scrawl on paper to be discovered between Mr. Smith's book and the 
printed prattle of the average globe-trotter. Our author's work has been done, as it were, with a chisel and an emery wheel. He goes deeply

the well-struck gold coin bears the image of the steel matrix." The Critic.

ma ster. No book like this has been written on China except one, and that is Dr. Smith's 'Chinese Characteristics,' published some ten years 
a f?o. The two books together may fairly be said to give a clearer idea of China as it is than any or all of the 5,000 or 6,000 works published on 
the Empire during the last century." From the Philadelphia Press, July 1, 1900.

H **'** vr wruil/AI, Tung Weng College. Peking, China. With seventy illustrations from photo- 
graphs and nature drawings, a map and index. 8vo, cloth, $2.00. 

" Dr. Martin, as the head of the college created by the Chinese Foreign Office, learned at first hand what he describes, and his story is a 
modest narrative of things seen and known. The book is especially interesting in its richness of personal reminiscences of notable personages, 
both native and foreign. It is very full also concerning recent events in which China, Russia and Japan have been concerned." The Critic. 

"He writes of political, social, and missionary questions with learning, and at the same time in a popular way, and he gives us constantly, 
also, picturesque glances at the manners and costumes of the common people. The book is illustrated in an intelligent way. No student of 
Eastern affairs can afford to neglect this work, which will take its place with Dr. Williams' ' The Middle Kingdom ' as an authoritative work on 
China." The Outlook.

and as easily read as that you are now reading.

TWO GREAT NOVELS 

READY EARLY IN OCTOBER 
BARRIE'S MASTERPIECE 

Tommy and Grizel 

By JAMES M. BARRIE, Author of "Sentimental Tommy," etc. 

A/IR. BARRIE'S new novel has been accepted everywhere as the most important book 
*** which he has yet written a character-study of remarkable originality, presented 
with power, humor, and pathos. The Chicago Advance says : " Barrie has created a 
character absolutely unique and of striking individuality. There is no other such instance 
of vivid and subtle character- study in recent fiction." " The inimitable Tommy," says 
one reviewer, " redeems the promise of his youth, and Barrie presents him so lovingly 
that he is fascinating." The advance orders for the novel are so large as to make a first 
edition of 40,000 copies necessary. 

" The reappearance of Barrie and Tommy in SCRIBNER'S is cause for devout rejoicing 
among novel-weary readers. Here are originality and quiet humor and deft work- 
manship to make even the most sated take courage once more" N. Y. Evening Post. 

Illustrated by Bernard Partridge. I2mo, $1.50 
A STIRRING HISTORICAL ROMANCE 

The House of Egremont 

By MOLLY ELLIOT SEAWELL 

Author of "The Sprightly Romance of Marsac," etc. 

'T'HIS historical novel is the most important and longest piece of fiction that Miss 
* Seawell has yet written. It is a romance of the seventeenth century, dealing with the 
friends of the exiled Stuarts, and is full of adventure. It is a time to which Miss Seawell 
has given special study and which always exerts a great fascination. The author's dramatic 
style, so well exemplified in " The Sprightly Romance of Marsac," is still more apparent 
in this new work.

A New and Popular Edition, containing the authorized 
and complete texts, and including certain suppressed

Life of George Borrow." 
THE BIBLE IN SPAIN. 
LAVENQRO. ROMANY RYE. 
THE GYPSIES OF SPAIN. (Nearly ready.) 
4 vols. Illustrated, 8vo, each $2. 
This is the first uniform edition of Borrow's works to 
appear in this country, and the fact that they are to be edited 
by the famous Scholar Gypsy's biographer, Professor W. I. 
Knapp, is sufficient criterion of their excellence. 

The Complete Works of Lord 
Macaulay. 

Knickerbocker Edition. With an introduction by 
EDWARD P. CHENEY, A. M., Professor of European 
History in the University of Pennsylvania. 20 vols.,

" The towns are sketched by various well-known writers, 
who have done their work with evident enthusiasm. They 
are books brimful of interest. Both text and illustration 
distinguish them." Independent. 

Sons of the Morning. 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS, author of "Children of the 
Mist," etc. With frontispiece, 8vo, $1 50. 
This is the first novel written by Mr. Phillpotts since the 
publication of the beautiful and powerful story, the " Chil- 
dren of the Mist." It represents more mature work and can 
but add to the reputation that came to him through the 
earlier book. The keenest and most pertinent word of appre- 
ciation for the ' ' Children of the Mist ' ' came from the veteran 
novelist, R. D. Blackmore, who, ' knowing nothing of the 
author," wrote of " the deep interest, the rare humor, and the 
vivid descriptions " that he found in the story. The author 
oi " Lorna Doone " has since passed away, and more directly 
than could be true of any other English writer, Eden Phillpotts 
is recognized as his successor. 



Literary Hearthstones. 

Studies of the Home-Life of Certain Writers and 
Thinkers. By MARION HARLAND, author of " Some 
Colonial Homesteads and Their Stories," " Where 
Ghosts Walk," etc. Fully illustrated. 16mo, price 
per volume, $1.50. 

SECOND SERIES NOW READY. 
HANNAH MORE. JOHN KNOX. 

FIRST SERIES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED. 
CHARLOTTE BRONTE. WILLIAM COWPER. 
"The writer has read her authorities with care, and, 
whenever it has been practicable, she has verified by personal 
investigation what she has heard and read. We nave, as a 
result, narratives excellent as records and distinctly readable. 
Anecdotes are introduced with tact; the treatment of the 
authors is sympathetic and characterized by good judg- 
ment." New York Tribune. 

Later Love Letters of a Musician. 

By MYRTLE REED, author of " Love Letters of a 

Musician," etc. 16ino, $1.75. 

In " Later Love Letters" there is all of the charm of the 
earlier book. The treatment is original, and the musical 
quotations fit so perfectly with the sentiment of the letters 
that nothing is forced or stilted. 

A History of Greece. 

By EVELYN ABBOTT, M.A., LL.D., Jowett Lecturer 
in Greek History at Baliol College, Oxford. To be 
completed in four parts, sold separately.

A New Study of the Sonnets of 
Shakespeare. 

By PARKE GODWIN. 16mo, $1.50. 
" A notable addition to the literature of the sonnets. It 
will,idoubtless, raise up a host of followers ready to defend 
its every position against all comers. The wiser sort will find 
in it much to accept, while they take unfeigned delight in 
the venerable author's enthusiastic exposition of his lofty 
theme." New York Times Saturday Review. 

Meditations of the Heart. 

A Book of Private Devotion for Old and Young. Col- 
lected, Adapted, and Composed by ANNIE JOSEPHINE

GOTTHEIL. 16mo, $1.25. 



A Book for All Readers. 

Designed as an Aid to the Collection, Use, and Preservation of Books, and the Formation of Public and Private 

Libraries. By AINBWORTH RAND SPOFFORD. 12mo, half vellum, $2.00. 

' In all the field of books about books there is nothing else in existence which covers so well and so clearly, so wide a 
range of subjects. ... It is impossible to read a single chapter, or even a page of the five hundred contained in the present 
Tolume, without either gaining fresh information upon some particular subject, or finding some fact we half know, so clearly 
stated as to make a lasting and vivid impression upon us. Written by a man thoroughly versed in library lore and methods, 
Mr. Spofford's book will be found of the utmost value by all who either are, or wish to become, attached to library forces."

well-bred art, the deft technic that produces the result. 

A CAPE COD WEEK. 

12mo. 170pp. Cloth. $1.00. 

" The author shows her readers that a week spent on 
Cape Cod counts for more than many weeks that may 
be spent at other places of popular resort. The par- 
ticular week . . . was a September week, when the 
picking of the cranberry bogs was just beginning. . . . 
The author's visit to the Cape was made in company 
with a party of girls who . . . deserve having their 
talk and chatter reported in a book just as beautiful 
as the one we have now in hand." Boston Transcript.

12tno. 285pp. Cloth. $1.00. 

" It is all told in quiet, easy fashion, the satire is

us. Miss Trumbull possesses "keenness, quickness, 
and acuteness of mind which make capital narrative 
and fine descriptions of nature." 

" Miss Trumbull is blessed by a most delightful and 
unpretentious gift of story telling. Her work suggests 
a twilight musician ; she has a certain dainty humor in 
her touch." The Citizen.

interested in birds from the side of humanity or natural history, all to whom the beginnings of religion offer 
fascinating problems, will enjoy this little book, which is decorated by Mr. George Wharton Edwards, whose 
clever hand and fancy have struck just the right notes of savagery and quaintness for such a theme. Cover, title- 
page, beginnings and ends of chapters, tables of contents, etc., have their own charming original design, while the 
pages of text are frequently marked by some little sketch in which the figure of some real or mythic bird appears.

THEODORE PARKER, PREACHER AND REFORMER. 

By JOHN WHITE CHADWICK. With two Portraits. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

A biography of one of the most marked characters in American history. Theodore Parker was one of the 
great preachers of his time, and one of the prophetic reformers. He was regarded as a dangerous heretic, but 
he is now gladly recognized as one who was merely in advance of his day, a robust believer in all the essentials 
of religion, and a most interesting personality. Mr. Chadwick is peculiarly qualified to tell the story of his 
great life, and he tells it with a fine sense of proportion, with perfect sympathy, and with uncommon literary 
charm.

Mr. Conant has given special attention to the eco- 
nomic and political problems growing out of the new

book will be of great service to those who recognize 
the tremendous competition which now drives the great 
manufacturing nations, and who wish to understand the 
serious questions which confront the United States in 
its role of a " world power."

their various callings, and of the approaches made in 
the case of each to what promised to be a desirable 
" manifest destiny."

FRANK SAMUEL CHILD, author of "An Un-

This story is in a comparatively new field, the War 
of 1812 ; and while it has much of the spirit of that 
time, it abounds in adventures, incidents of interests ;

tractive to youthful readers.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS 



THE STORY OF THE SOLDIER 

By General G. A. FORSYTE, U. S. A. (Retired). Illus- 
trated by R. F. ZOGBAUM. A new volume in the Story 
of the West Series, edited by RIPLEY HITCHCOCK. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

In the great task of opening the empire west of the Missouri the 
American regular soldier has played a part as large and heroic as it is 
unknown. The purpose of this book, written by a gallant officer who 
has been a part of what he writes, is to picture the American soldier 
in the life of exploration, reconnaisances, establishing posts, guarding 
wagon trains, repressing outbreaks, or battling with hostile Indians, 
which has been so large a part of the army's active work for a hundred 
years. To this work General Forsyth furnishes perspective and back- 
ground by tracing the origin of the regular soldier, the popular feeling 
regarding him, and his relation to politics and the militia, his training 
and the manner in which he has borne the brunt of war at the outset 
of real war from the inception of the Government. In his task as the 
pioneer of civilization in the West the soldier is shown as explorer 
witness the Lewis and Clark and Pitse expeditions as the protector 
of wagon trains and railroad builders, and his active service is illus- 
trated in General Forsyth's brilliant and dramatic accounts of the 
great Indian campaigns of the West. His story of the soldier presents 
a fresh and thrilling chapter of American history. The book does 
justice to the heroic and little appreciated figure of the regular soldier, 
and it illustrates the gallant and thankless achievements of men like 
those who have just passed from us Lawton, Henry, and Liscum. Such 
a book has been peculiarly needed outside of its epic quality and 
thrilling interest. Americana will read it with pride and with a won- 
der not unmixed with shame that the regular soldier has been so long 
ignored by his fellow-countrymen. 



COMMODORE PAUL JONES 

By CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY, author of "Reuben 
James," "For the Freedom of the Seas," "The Grip of 
Honor," etc. A new volume in the Great Commanders 
Series, edited by General JAMES GRANT WILSON. 12mo, 
cloth, with photogravure portrait and maps. $1.50. 
As a writer upon naval life from the point of view of the historical 
romancer, Mr. Brady stands at the head of the American writers of 
this generation. He is a historian as well as a novelist, and his his- 
torical and biographical work has attracted marked attention on 
account of the knowledge, the grasp of theme, and the power of sym- 
pathetic discernment which he has shown. A Life of Paul Jones by 
Mr. Brady represents a peculiarly felicitous union of author and 
theme. There is no more picturesque and heroic figure in naval his- 
tory than that of the doughty little captain who fought and captured 
the Serapis when his own ship was sinking under him. His career 
presented features which have proved puzzling to some writers, and 
the work which Mr. Brady has done in clearing up his life, and in 
presenting a lucid narrative enriched with extracts from Paul Jones's 
more important correspondence has a peculiar and permanent value. 
Mr. Brady's vigorous style, his vivid imagination and dramatic force 
are most happily exhibited in this book. It fully deserves to be 
called more fascinating than most romances. 



THE BOERS IN WAR 

The True Story o f the Burghers in the field. By HOWARD 
C. HILLEGAS, author of " Oom Paul's People." Elab- 
orately illustrated with photographs by the author and 
others. Uniform with "Oom Paul's People." 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

"A book of even wider interest than 'Oom Paul's People.' A most 
novel and curious account of a military form that has never been 
duplicated in modern times ; exceptionally interesting. Mr. Hillegas 
has given us beyond question the best account yet published." 
Brooklyn Eagle. 



THE INDIVIDUAL 

A Study of Life and Death by Professor N. S. SHALER of 

Harvard University. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The lucidity and suggestiveness of Professor N. S. Shaler's writ- 
ings, whether they are expositions of scientific themes or discussions 
which touch upon sociological topics, will induce readers to await 
with especial interest his forthcoming book, '"The Individual: A 
Study of Life and Death," which is a striking and noble presentation 
of the subject of death from a fresh point of view. Professor Shaler's 
book is one of deep and permanent interest. He points out that while 
the problems of natural selection and evolution have called attention 
to the results which come from the temporary quality of the individ- 
ual, they have not heretofore led to any extended interest in the rela- 
tion of the ephemeral nature of the individual to the other individu- 
alities of the universe and to the method of its organization. In his 
preface he writes as follows : 

" In effect this book is a plea for an education as regards the place 
of the individual life in the whole of Nature which shall be consistent 
with what we know of the universe. It is a plea for an understanding 
of the relations of the person with the realm which is, in the fullest 
sense, his own; with his fellow-beings of all degrees which are his 
kinsmen ; with the past and the future of which he is an integral part. 
It is a protest against the idea, bred of many natural misconceptions, 
that a human being is something apart from its fellows ; that it is born 
into the world and dies out of it into the loneliness of a supernatural 
realm. It is this sense of isolation which, more than all else, is the 
curse of life and the sting of death." 



THE FOOTSTEPS OF A THRONE 

A romance by MAX PEMBERTON. Uniform with "Kron- 
stadt" and " The Phantom Army." 12mo, cloth. Illus- 
trated. $1.50. 

Max Pemberton's brilliant pen has shown that " the true romancer" 
lives to-day. Mr. Pemberton chooses the present and not the histor- 
ical past, and he proves that the life of to-day may suggest romance, 
mystery, incident, and adventure in as fascinating forms as the life of 
the days of lance and armor. His new novel deals with Russian social 
and political intrigue, a field wherein he is fully at home. There is a 
charming love story which is carried through a stirring series of ad- 
ventures to a fortunate end. Mr. Pemberton's romance, which is full 
of life and vivid in its unflagging interest, shows perhaps the highest 
mark which he has reached in his successful career as a romancer. 



KING STORK OF THE NETHERLANDS 

A romance of the days of the Dutch Republic. By ALBERT 

LEE, author of " The Key of the Holy House," and "A 

Gentleman Pensioner." " Appletons' Town and Country 

Library." 12mo, cloth, $1.00; paper, 50 cents. 

Mr. Lee has earned a brilliant reputation within the last two years 

as a novelist of the Dutch Republic. His new romance, with its thril- 

ing tale of the betrayal of William and his people by the faithless 

ruler in whom they trusted, sketches in a singularly vivid fashion a 

chapter of history which cannot be read without deep interest and 

emotion. 

Ready Shortly. 
Hamlin Garland's Great Romance: 

THE EAGLE'S HEART 

A Story of the West. By HAMLIN GARLAND. 12mo t 

cloth, $1.50. 

Hamlin Garland has recently completed the novel which is regarded 
as the strongest and most important literary work that he has yet done. 
The title is "The Eagle's Heart," and the story presents an epic of the 
West, wherein the hero with "the eagle's heart" goes westward and 
enters upon the strange and picturesque life of the plains.

THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIND. 

In the history of architecture there have 
been two predominant types, the Greek and 
the Gothic. Each of them has undergone his- 
torical modifications, in accordance with the 
changing needs of mankind, but each has 
nevertheless remained true to its fundamental 
ideal. In the case of Greek architecture, that 
ideal has comprised unity of design, symmetry 
of construction, and simple definite relations 
between the several parts. In the case of 
Gothic architecture, it has meant more atten- 
tion to detail than to the general plan, a dis- 
regard of severely proportioned lines, and a 
certain degree of confusion of aim. The dif- 
ference between the Parthenon and " the Bible 
of Amiens," for example, illustrates a funda- 



mental divergence of method and of aspiration ; 
the two ideal types are here exhibited in the 
strongest of possible contrasts. 

Transferring now our attention from the 
single field of architecture to the broader domain 
of art in general, we find the same contrast of 
type exhibited wherever we look, although we 
broaden our terms to correspond with the wider 
view, and now say classical and romantic, in- 
stead of simply saying Greek and Gothic. The 
Parthenon is classical art, but so also are the 
" Antigone " and the Hermes of Olympia and 
the Pompeian frescoes. So also are the fugues 
of Bach and the canvases of David, and the 
" Hellenics " of Landor. On the other hand, 
Amiens cathedral is romantic art, but so also 
are the sculptures of Michelangelo and the 
plays of Shakspeare and the paintings of Ros- 
setti. In some sense even, as a foreshadowing 
of the romanticism of the modern Christian 
world, the measures of Pindar and of Virgil 
escape from the restraints of the classical spirit, 
and take the freer range which we attribute 
primarily to the form of art which it was the 
province of the Middle Ages and the Renais- 
sance to develope in all its fulness of creative 
splendor. 

It does not seem to us an altogether fanciful 
analogy to find in the domain of the intellectual 
life, as distinguished from the creative, a sim- 
ilar divergence of fundamental types. We find 
the intellect whose characteristics are unity 
and symmetry and definite relationship of ac- 
tivities ; and we find the intellect with whose 
characteristics these are strongly contrasted, 
to which they are often diametrically opposed. 
In the first category we have the makers of 
systems, the men whose works exhibit an archi- 
tectonic character so evident that our attention 
is directed to the coherent whole rather than 
to the separate details. That is, each detail, 
however significant in itself, becomes much 
more significant when considered in relation 
to the entire logical structure. Such an intel- 
lect keeps itself well in hand, restrains the 
tendency to capricious expression, is firmly 
based upon certain fundamental ideas, and 
brings every vagrant fancy wherewith it is beset 
to the primary test of this essential conformity. 
We recognize this type of mind in Euclid, in 
Aquinas, in Spinoza, in Kant, and in Mr.

Herbert Spencer. In each individual case, we 
realize that the work must stand or fall as a 
whole, that, given a logical method of proced- 
ure, it will stand if the foundations are sound, 
and that if they are shaky the entire structure 
must totter to its fall. 

In the second of our categories we find those 
discursive intellects that are content to exhibit 
the separate facets of truth as it is revealed to 
them, that take sufficient satisfaction in its 
sparkling gleam, and make no effort to bring 
the light to a single focus. They feel instinc- 
tively that truth as a whole must be self-con- 
sistent, and leave to more systematic minds 
the task of reconciling seeming contradictions 
and of elucidating whatever appears paradox- 
ical. Such minds, when actively at work, live 
intensely in the present moment, leaving the 
past and the future to care for themselves, and 
giving slight heed to the accusation of inconsist- 
ency. To this intellectual type we accredit 
Cicero (the epistolary and philosophical Cicero) 
Montaigne, Samuel Johnson (with all his 
crabbed prejudices), Voltaire, Hume, Ruskin, 
and Emerson. Probably the traditional clas- 
sification which makes of all men by nature 
either Aristotelians or Platonists is not very 
different from that which we have here sought 
to indicate. 

Each of these contrasted modes of the intel- 
lectual life has its own particular attendant 
dangers, and each needs the corrective influ- 
ence of the other. In the former case, there 
is always the danger of doctrinaireism, of twist- 
ing the truth to fit the preconceived scheme, of 
seeking to demand acceptance by the sheer 
force of logical coherency. Reverting to our 
architectural figure, there is always the danger 
of magnifying the importance of the structure 
qua structure, and of the consequent failure to 
adapt it to human needs. In the latter case, 
there is always the danger of encouraging a 
lax mental habit, of holding the requirements of 
logic too cheap, of allowing the impulse or the 
emotion of the moment to usurp the sway of 
the sovereign reason. The resulting structure 
is apt to be comparable to one of these com- 
posite buildings in which the eye is engaged by 
many fascinating details, but in which it can 
take no satisfaction as a whole. 

The natural bent of each individual who 
leads the intellectual life in any sort will fix 
the essential type to be aimed at. Each type 
has its peculiar satisfactions no less than its 
peculiar dangers. There are some who can 
conceive of no other ambition than that which 



seeks to make life of one piece, to shape its 
intellectual activities into a consistent whole. 
Every new idea must be brought to the test of 
those already accepted, must be examined and 
reexamined in the light of the principles that 
have been adopted as fundamentally important. 
This attitude toward truth is maintained at the 
cost of much strenuous endeavor, the severe 
repression of many a natural impulse, and the 
stern rejection of many a pleasing fancy. 
Viewed in retrospect, the reward seems suffi- 
cient ; but it is hard to keep the chords of the 
mind strung to the requisite pitch, and the 
temptation at times becomes great to break 
loose from the stiffening bonds of prescription, 
and give unimpeded play to the faculties. 
Minds of the other type and this is no doubt 
the prevailing one are considerably freer in 
their activities, and thereby more receptive of 
new impressions. The hobgoblin inconsistency 
has no terrors for them ; they are prepared at 
any time to take a new intellectual start, to 
ignore past conclusions, and to formulate fresh 
ones in accordance with the new light in which 
some truth seems to stand revealed. The pure 
reason is no longer the sole dictator of thought, 
but shares its empire in some measure with the 
forces that control the emotional life. This 
attitude finds its satisfactions in the intense 
realizations of the moment which it permits, in 
the part which it allows to the sense of won- 
der, and in the ever-alluring prospect of com- 
ing upon new gateways of truth. To declare 
for one or the other of these attitudes is prob- 
ably futile ; each thinking mind finds its choice 
already made by the time the instinctive and 
unconscious period of thought is past. And 
whether the philosophy of conduct be built up 
by the logical method of a Spinoza or by the 
haphazard method of a Montaigne, the prac- 
tical outcome is apt to be much the same with 
minds of normal endowment. 

We have discussed these contrasting men- 
tal attitudes with reference to the individuals 
whom they primarily concern ; let us in con- 
clusion discuss them with reference to their 
influence upon the stream of human thought. 
In the long run, do the systematic thinkers 
determine the intellectual currents of history, 
leaving only its eddies and surface-ripples to 
be shaped by the discursive thinkers? Out- 
first thought is that they do. When we think 
of the immense authority, exercised for cen- 
tury after century, of an Aristotle or an 
Aquinas, it seems as if such were the only in- 
tellectual forces that have counted. But a little

reflection will bring the counter-opinion into 
view, and make us doubt our hasty initial as- 
sumption. Systems have their day and become 
stripped of their authority, whereas no sincere 
expression of the human spirit, struck out in 
the glow of some moment of intense vision, 
ever wholly loses its validity. This is why the 
poets, on the whole, have influenced the thoughts 
of men more than the philosophers. We may 
take leave to doubt whether the " Summa 
Theologies " has, all things considered, proved 
so potent and penetrating an influence upon 
religious thought as the " De Imitatione 
Christi," and we may confidently assert that, 
in the total reckoning, philosophical thought 
owes a greater debt to Plato than it does to 
Aristotle. The influence of the unsystematic 
writers is less imposing, but it seems to be 
farther-reaching than that of the architectonic 
thinkers. It is, after all, the open mind that 
makes possible all intellectual progress, and 
the mind of the systematic philosopher has too 
often but a single outlook, which may be in 
the wrong direction, turned toward the fading 
past rather than toward the glowing future of 
human thought. 



NIETZSCHE AND HIS PHILOSOPHY. 

By the death of Friedrich Nietzche, the world 
has lost the most radical philosopher of the century, 
and one of the most picturesquely eccentric figures 
in all literature. While at first he was under the 
influence of the philosophy of Schopenhauer and 
the artistic and aesthetic views of Richard Wagner, 
he soon entered the arena as an absolutely inde- 
pendent thinker, with an entirely original philoso- 
phy, whose avowed object was to reform all modern 
culture, yea, to bring about a new epoch in the 
history of human civilization. 

The aphoristical style of the works of this second 
and principal period of Nietzsche's literary activity 
was a departure from all precedent. His work was 
done almost exclusively in the open air. Stopping 
still in his walks, or lying outstretched in a Swiss 
or Italian landscape, he would fix upon loose sheets 
the thoughts on men and things which crossed his 
brain, recording all the joy and pain of his soul in 
scintillating epigrams, full of deep thought, boldness, 
and sarcasm. Undoubtedly he has devoted much 
labor to the polishing of his sentences, so as to find 
the most expressive word, the most picturesque 
phrase, the most striking simile. His sentences have 
an enrapturing splendor, a bewitching grace, and a 
dramatic animation to which must very largely be 
attributed the great effect which his works have 
had upon his readers. Even those who do not 
admit the inspiration of Nietzsche the prophet, 



can relish Nietzsche the writer. He never wearies 
the reader by following the same train of thought 
for more than a page at a time, though it is true 
that the same idea crops up in fragmentary form 
over and over again. But no less wonderful than 
his power of language are the scope and breadth of 
his observations, the depth of his borings into the 
human heart, the boldness of his inconoclasm, the 
Promethean presumption with which he tramples 
under foot all the received standards of morality. 

The starting point of Nietzsche's philosophy is 
the formula that the " will to power " is the main- 
spring of life. "What is good ? " he asks. " All that 
increases the feeling of power, will to power, power 
itself, in man." "What is happiness ? " " The feeling 
that power increases, that resistance is overcome." 

The will to power is the tendency of every man 
to assert his ego, to give dominance to his inten- 
tions. Nietzsche finds not only in all the manifes- 
tations of unadulterated human nature, but of 
nature generally, this tyrannical and inexorable 
assertion of claims to power. Now, if one aims at 
predominance and extension of power, it means 
subordination and subjection for another. Then 
only can a higher culture be created, where there 
are two clearly distinguishable castes, the one to do 
the work of society, the other to enjoy true leisure, 
a caste of compulsory workers and a caste of free 
or voluntary workers. The ennoblement of the 
human race or, as Nietzsche calls it, the eleva- 
tion of the type of "man" is the work of an 
aristocratic society, of a state of castes built upon 
suppression, subjection, and force. A thoroughly 
felt and asserted difference between class and class, 
the continuous looking down by the dominant caste 
upon their subjects and tools, and the equally con- 
tinuous practice of the two castes in commanding 
and obeying, respectively, result in what Nietzsche 
styles the "pathos of distance." Without this, 
there could never have arisen that other more mys- 
terious pathos, that desire for a constantly growing 
increase of the distance within the soul itself, the 
evolution of ever higher conditions, in short, the 
elevation of the type of man. 

A healthy aristocracy which will be a guarantee 
of ascending culture cannot exist, according to 
Nietzsche, unless it realizes that it is itself the aim 
and object of human society. It must necessarily 
accept without the slightest scruples of conscience 
the sacrifice of countless human beings who for its 
sake must be depreciated to imperfect beings, to 
slaves and tools. The root of such an aristocracy 
is the conviction that society does not exist for its 
own sake, but merely as the frame and ground- 
work upon which a select kind of being, to-wit, 
that aristocracy, rises to the height of its task, the 
elevation of the type of man ; comparable to those 
climbing plants of Java which with their arms em- 
brace the oak tree so long that finally they creep and 
rise high above it, but, supported by it, develop 
and exhibit their crown in a higher and freer sphere. 

Thus, egoism, according to Nietzsche, is an 



220 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



essential attribute of the noble soul which accepts 
the fact of its egoism without any question mark, 
without the slightest feeling of hardness, force, or 
arbitrariness ; on the contrary, as something which 
is founded in the very nature of things, as some- 
thing which is justice itself. The noble soul admits 
that there are others entitled to equal rights with 
itself; it honors itself in them and in the rights 
which it accords to them ; it doubts not that the ex- 
change of honors and privileges is of the essence 
of all commerce between equals. 

It is clear to Nietzsche that a dominant class 
must have different forms and views of life than a 
serving class. In his review of the many different 
systems of morality, be they coarser or finer, which 
among different peoples and at different times have 
governed the conduct of men, Nietzsche discovers 
two general types : a morality of aristocracy, which 
he calls Master Morality, and a morality of the domi- 
nated class, which he calls Slave Morality. Mas- 
ter Morality distinguishes between good and bad ; 
Slave Morality between good and evil. In the 
case of Master Morality, the exultation and pride 
of the soul is valued as " good," while everything 
contrary to these conditions of the soul is valued 
as " bad." " Good " is everything which the high- 
minded nobleman does ; " bad " or contemptible, is 
everything which the noble spirit dislikes. Bad 
and contemptible is the coward, the uneasy, the small, 
the suspicious, the conventionally moral, the relig- 
iously scrupulous, the one who is ever thinking of 
narrow utility, the one who humbles himself, the dog 
kind of man who tolerates mistreatment of himself. 

Thus all noble morality and view of life arise 
from aristocracy's triumphant approval of its own 
doings. Not so with the morality and view of life 
of all dominated and dependent classes, the so-called 
Slave Morality. There the hatred of aristocracy, 
the craving for an alleviation of their condition, is 
uppermost in their moral valuations. The slave 
has a justifiable suspicion of everything which is 
honored as good by the dominant class. For what- 
ever is there " good " must needs hurt the oppressed, 
and is therefore regarded as "evil" in Slave 
Morality. On the other hand, the slaves have 
gratitude and appreciation for all the qualities 
which tend to lighten the burdens of the suffering 
and oppressed like pity, charity, warm hearted- 
ness, patience, industry, kindness. All these quali- 
ties are in Slave Morality classed as " good." 

And now we can understand Nietzsche's form- 
ula, " beyond good and evil." It means a realm 
removed from Slave Morality, in which men are 
" superior to the illusions of moral sentiment." 

Nietzsche deplores that in the battle between 
Master Morality and Slave Morality, between 
Roman aristocratic method of valuation on the one 
hand and Jewish-Christian-plebeian on the other, 
the latter has been victorious along the whole line. 
The entire European civilization has received its 
decisive feature through the catchwords of Slave 
Morality, "good" and "evil." Hence the ten- 



dency of European culture towards producing a 
coddled, pitiful, weak, and low-minded race, by 
valuing the greatest good to the greatest number 
as the highest maxim of society. This crime against 
life should be reversed by a thoroughgoing " re- 
valuing " of ethical values. This tendency should 
be arrested by aristocracy. It should deliver itself 
from the enervating principles of " good and evil," 
should place itself " beyond good and evil," should 
accept the only mode of valuation becoming to it, 
namely, the distinction between " good " and 
" bad " or " contemptible ; " it should again as- 
sume the reins of mastery, subjugate the masses 
and spoliate them for its purposes; in short, it 
should again hold in high regard, and bring to fur- 
ther development, the proud instincts innate in 
man, and thereby save at least itself from degener- 
ation and decadence. With this achievement, a 
new, a higher, a more beautiful, a more powerful 
type of man will have been created. This ideal 
type Nietzsche calls " Uebermensch " over-man, 
beyond-man. To cultivate these noble instincts, 
to breed this higher race everywhere and in suffi- 
cient numbers to fulfil their historical mission, 
Nietzsche advises those who confess this master 
morality of "good" and "bad" the "emanci- 
pated spirits," as he calls them to live in solitude, 
away from the pitiable morality of the present so- 
ciety, which must make life unbearable to them. 
In "Thus spake Zarathustra," Nietzsche apos- 
trophises these free spirits and prepares them for 
their tremendous task. 

One may easily imagine that this apostle of aris- 
tocracy has no patience with the doctrine of the 
equal rights of man. He thunders against it in a 
dozen keys and in a hundred variations. 

"The bloody farce with which the French Revolution 
played itself out, its ' immorality,' is of little account to me ; 
what I hate is its Rousseau-mora/ity the so-called ' truths ' 
of the Revolution with which it operates to the present day, 
and wins over to itself all the shallow and mediocre. The 
doctrine of equality ! But there exists no deadlier poison ; 
for it seems to be preached by justice itself, while it does 
away with justice. . . . ' Equality to the equal, inequality to 
the unequal ' that would be the true teaching of justice ; and 
the corollary likewise, ' Never make the unequal equal.' 
That such dreadful and bloody events happened around the 
doctrine of equality, has given a sort of glory end luridness 
to this * modern idea' par excellence ; so that the Revolution 
as a spectacle has seduced even the noblest minds. That is, 
after all, no reason for esteeming it any higher." 

Nietzsche is the deadly foe of Christian morality, 
of the teachings of the Church, because it antag- 
onizes the preservative instincts of life as sinful, as 
temptations ; because it is inimical to happiness on 
earth ; because it takes the part of the weak and 
the low against the higher type of man. He regards 
the concepts of " the other world," " last judgment," 
" immortality of the soul," as inventions of the 
priest, as torture instruments by which he designed 
to and did become master. He arraigns the man 
of to-day, who cannot be ignorant of these things, 
for still professing Christianity. With terrible force 
he exposes our hypocrisy by contrasting our un- 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



221 



Christian acts in public and private life with our 
Christian professions. Says he : 

" What happens to the last sentiment of seemliness, of 
respect for ourselves, when our statesmen even, otherwise a 
very unbiased species of men, and practical Anti-Christians 
through and through, call themselves Christians at the present 
day, and go to the communion ? . . . A prince at the head of 
his regiments, splendid as the expression of the selfishness 
and elation of his nation, but, without any shame, confess- 
ing himself a Christian I . . . Whom then does Christianity 
deny ? What does it call the ' world ' ? To be a soldier, a 
judge, a patriot ; to defend one's self ; to guard one's honor ; 
to seek one's advantage ; to be proud. . . . All practice of 
every hour, all instincts, all valuations realizing themselves 
in deeds, are at present An ti- Christian ; what a monster of 
falsity must modern man be that he nevertheless is not 
ashamed to be still called a Christian." 

Nietzsche's great mistake was to fight all tradi- 
tional morality as such, because some of its teachings 
were repulsive to him, because some of its teachers, 
especially the early disciples of Christ, went so far 
as to demand the annihilation of all natural instincts 
of man. The code of Christian morality, with its 
rigid asceticism, its thorough negation of every 
positive desire or will, can certainly not be more 
mistaken than Nietzsche's im moral ism, with its un- 
bounded license, self-glorification, and self-indul- 
gence. If it is really necessary to revise our code of 
morals and that might be admitted, then the 
first thing necessary is to overcome this one-sided 
prejudice against the traditional concepts of moral- 
ity as a whole. 

The essence and end of all morality is the liber- 
ating of some latent force which is needed for the 
solution of the problems of civilization. The work 
of Christianity was to prepare and fit the half-bar- 
barous peoples of Europe for the task of civilization, 
for which there was slumbering in them an abun- 
dance of latent power. But this latent power had 
first to be made free and available by a thorough 
cleansing of their hearts and minds from the brutal 
instincts and desires, the coarse and primitive 
thoughts and views which possessed them. The 
purgative applied by Christianity to accomplish 
this cleansing process was asceticism, the negation 
of the senses. It was an heroic remedy ; but 
whether too heroic or not, one might well pause for 
an answer. It is this remedy which Nietzsche so 
severely condemns. He judges all morality merely 
by its negative means and methods. Many of these 
we can and do safely dispense with nowadays, 
many of these we might in our present state of civi- 
lization recognize even as evils. Nietzsche has 
irrefutably established the hollowness and hypocrisy 
of many a paragraph in our code of morality. We 
might even disregard some of its positive commands. 
For example, it is not necessary that we should 
love our neighbor as well as we do ourselves, and 
we do not do it, either. But with all that, unless 
we are willing to respect the rights of others, 
whether rich or poor, mighty or weak; unless we 
accord equal opportunities to all, no matter how 
constituted ; unless we fight selfishness and condemn 
the spoliation of the weak and unfortunate, there is 



an end of civilized society, and we resolve ourselves 
into a band of brutes. The aggregate of human 
happiness is certainly more increased by uplifting 
the masses than by the elevation of the few through 
the humbling of the many. 

Nor are the concepts of God, immortality, heaven 
and hell, indispensable ; for we know there are 
men, and many of them, who without such beliefs 
are honest and honorable, kind, and tolerant ; who 
love truth, despise falsehood, practice charity, con- 
quer egoism, all without hope of reward or fear of 
punishment in this or another world ; who recognize 
the existence of moral laws of nature, as they do 
the laws of the physical world ; who are ethical to 
the core without believing in any creed ; who are 
religious without religion. No, it is not necessary 
to be a Christian, nor even a believer in any posi- 
tive religion, to admit that without morality (by 
which, it will be perceived, I do not mean the whole 
traditional code of morals) the world would be 
chaos. Nietzsche, however, arraigns the whole 
system as a positive evil, as inimical to the instincts 
of life. 

The trouble with Nietzsche's criticisms is that 
he became so enamored of the one fixed idea that 
the many must be kept in subjugation in order that 
the few might be the stronger, freer, nobler, and 
happier, which idea he expresses by the formula 
"pathos of distance," that our civilization which 
tends to diffuse light and warmth, freedom and 
happiness, to strengthen the weak, to free the en- 
slaved, to enlighten the ignorant, to elevate the low 
appears from his view point as decadence and 
degeneration. He complains that our civilization 
and its methods are " anti-natural." Of course 
they are. Civilization and naturalness are neces- 
sarily contradictory terms. But to return to natur- 
alness would be to efface history, to retrace our 
steps to the cradle of the human family not that 
cradle which is supposed to have stood in Paradise, 
but the one to which Darwin refers ; to become 
cannibals or beasts of prey. This is certainly not 
Nietzsche's ideal. If not, why thunder against 
"anti-naturalness" ? 

Has Nietzsche's ingenious, brilliant, and original 
attempt to arrest the victorious course of socialism, 
to resist the powerful onslaught of the masses in 
their fight for economic and social equality, any 
chance of success ? I think not. His aristocratic 
theory, the principles of his " beyond morality," 
run directly counter to the ethical evolution of man- 
kind for millenniums. This evolution clearly tends 
to increase constantly the circle of those who are 
permitted to participate in the blessings of civiliza- 
tion, the advantages of education, the opportunities 
of free government. The wheel of history runs 
with irresistible force in the direction of uplifting 
the masses. Its course cannot be stopped even by 
the extraordinary power and genius of a Nietzsche, 
for it is propelled by that mightiest of all forces

JAMES MARTJNEATJ: A STUDY.* 



No sweeping disparagement of Mr. Jack- 
son's learned and thoughtful life of James 
Martineau is intended when we say that the 
general reader is likely to find it lacking in 
the order of facts which, since Boswell, have 
formed the recognized staple of biography. 
Dr. Martineau certainly was not the ideal 
quarry for a Boswell. He seems to have led, 
so far as is humanly possible, the purely intel- 
lectual life, and his memory is not of the sort 
about which anecdotes naturally cluster. Still, 
we think that the portrait drawn by Mr. Jack- 
son is unduly deficient in warmth and color, 
and that had he shown us more of Dr. Mar- 
tineau as Dr. Martineau showed himself to 
those who knew him familiarly in life, he would 
have produced a more life-like as well as a 
more attractive picture. In fact, the impres- 
sion one gets of Dr. Martineau from Mr. Jack- 
son's (in point of ordinary biographical detail) 
somewhat lean and unsatisfying pages suggests 
Heine's description of Mme. de Stael's con- 
ception of the Germans a race of men, that 
is to say, " without livers, mere animated pieces 
of virtue wandering over snowfields, and dis- 
coursing of naught but morals and philosophy." 
Even in that section of his book which is pro- 
fessedly devoted to the portrayal of Dr. Mar- 
tineau " The Man," it is rather mainly as the 
austere exemplar of high moral and intellectual 
living that Mr. Jackson elects to consider his 
hero ; and this, he thinks, should " suffice " 
for his readers. " Of the quiet hours spent 
with him," he disappointingly assumes, " I 
need not tell." 

" Suffice that they fixed in my mind the impression 
of a sage, a hero, and a saint; of one who might con- 
verse with Plato, and dare with Luther, and revere 
with Tauler; an habitue of the Academy, who thrilled 
to the Categorical Imperative, and who knelt at the 
Cross." 

To the Kantian inquirer it will be pleasant and 
significant to learn that Dr. Martineau was at 
once a Christian, and to some extent a walker 
in the " olive grove of Academe," and that he 
could also " thrill to the Categorical Impera- 
tive"; but we suspect the plain reader, who 
seeks in biography mainly the portrait of a 
man, will sigh for something more concrete and

definite than is to be found in these scholastic 
flights of Mr. Jackson's. 

Simplicity of style is a merit which Mr. 
Jackson seems at times to consciously avoid, 
especially in that section of his book where it 
ought to be cultivated. For instance, after 
telling us in plain English that Dr. Martineau 
was in figure a " spare " man, he carefully adds, 
"Of adipose tissue he had no superfluity"; 
while the birth of a child is thus chronicled : 
" Anon another came to bless them, a baby 
Helen, an angel visitant that stayed not long." 

But whatever may be Mr. Jackson's short- 
comings as a narrator of simple events, and as 
a biographer in the usual and we think the 
proper sense of the term, there can hardly be 
a question as to his signal merits as a critical 
though in general acquiescent and admiring 
expositor of Dr. Martineau's philosophico- 
religious creed and teaching. As an exposi- 
tion, therefore, of Dr. Martineau's teaching, 
and as an account of the progressive steps by 
which the force of that teaching was borne in 
upon a mind not altogether inclined to accept 
it as true in its entirety, Mr. Jackson's book 
must be pronounced a most satisfying and nu- 
tritive one. Mr. Jackson's original plan, in 
preparing the volume, was to present a simple 
account of Dr. Martineau's life, to be followed 
by an analysis of his doctrines. " As I medi- 
tated, however," he says, " the thought occurred 
to me that I might make the volume not only 
an account of Dr. Martineau, but also an utter- 
ance of my own mind ; and these two aims 
have ruled my labor." After briefly outlining 
the general course of his own gradual conver- 
sion to the opinions of his master, Mr. Jackson 
adds, " Thus have I toiled on, as serenely sat- 
isfied with Dr. Martineau as was John Fiske 
with Herbert Spencer when he wrote the elo- 
quent volumes of his Cosmic Philosophy." 

James Martineau came of French Huguenot 
stock, his refugee ancestor being Gaston Mar- 
tineau of Bergerac, who came to England after 
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and 
settled at Norwich, where he practiced as a 
surgeon. It was at Norwich that James Mar- 
tineau was born, on April 21, 1805. From 
eight to fourteen years of age he attended the 
Norwich grammar school, whence he was trans- 
ferred, at the instance of his sister Harriet, to 
a boarding school at Bristol, then under the 
head-mastership of Dr. Lant Carpenter, whose 
influence upon his rarely promising pupil 
proved to be as abiding as it was wholesome.

Dr. Martineau's, James Kenrick and Charles 
Wellbeloved, Mr. Jackson bestows some appre- 
ciative pages. After two years at Bristol Dr. 
Martineau studied mechanical engineering in 
the works of Mr. Fox, of Derby ; but a year 
spent in this not altogether congenial pursuit 
sufficed ; and he announced his desire to enter 
the ministry, much to the disappointment of 
his father, who saw in the change the surren- 
der of a calling that ensured a comfortable 
livelihood for one which, outside the Establish- 
ment, meant comparative poverty. The son's 
wish prevailed, however, and Dr. Martineau 
accordingly entered Manchester College, then 
at York, a school of liberal divinity, which 
had at the period of Dr. Martineau's under- 
graduateship already accomplished the tran- 
sition to the older type of Unitarianism. 
Later on, says Mr. Jackson, it took on Unit- 
arianism of the more modern type, which anon 
under Martineau it further unfolded, and now 
under Drummond reflects its fullest develop- 
ment. The course at Manchester College was 
five years ; and these for James Martineau 
were years of intense application or, as John 
Kenrick put it, of " intemperate study." He 
worked by a theory which he thus stated in 
later years : 

" I remember thinking that the use of education was 
to correct the weakness of nature, rather than to develop 
its strength, which would take care of itself ; and so I 
gave double time to whatever I disliked, and reserved 
my favorite studies for spare moments of comparatively 
tired will." 

In 1827, at the age of twenty-two, Mar- 
tineau completed his college course, and was 
" admitted to preach." In 1828 he was for- 
mally ordained, according to the Presbyterian 
usage. Dr. Martineau's early Presbyterian- 
ism was, however, as Mr. Jackson carefully 
points out, English, not Scotch, a material 
distinction, as the American must be reminded. 

" In America the name Presbyterian suggests John 
Knox and the Assembly's Catechism; while in England 
for the last three hundred years there has been a Pres- 
byterianism that writes its history from the days of 
Baxter, whose broad and tolerant spirit it has reflected. 
A ruling principle with it has been, that there shall be 
no binding dogma. . . . Indeed it is the antecedent of 
English Unitarianism; and a large number of the Uni- 
tarian churches in England to-day, and nearly all those 
of Ireland, are Presbyterian in their history. . . . The 
church, then, that ordained Mr. Martineau, stood for 
the heresy of the day." 

After a year of schoolmastering and preach- 
ing at Bristol Martineau was called to the 
co-pastoral office at the Eustace Street Pres- 
byterian Church in Dublin, his colleague and 
the senior incumbent being Dr. Taylor, for- 



merly of Norwich. The settlement was a 
pleasant one, with a sufficient income, and a 
demand upon his time and strength not excess- 
ive. In addition to taking pupils in Hebrew 
and the higher mathematics, Dr. Martineau 
was enabled to compile a new hymn-book for 
his church, which was sorely needed, and which 
was published in 1831. A sermon on " Peace 
in Division," printed in 1830, seems to have 
been the earliest of his published works. On 
the death of Dr. Taylor, Mr. Martineau came, 
or might have come, had he chosen to do so, 
by succession to his place. But here an insu- 
perable obstacle (insuperable to the morally 
high-strung Martineau, that is) presented 
itself, in the extraordinary form of an un- 
expected increase of salary. This increase of 
X100. proved on examination to be a share of 
ancient Regium Donum, latterly a parliamen- 
tary grant, but originally a royal bounty be- 
stowed by Charles I. upon the Presbyterians 
of Ireland to secure their loyalty, and thus in 
the nature of a bribe. Many good men had 
received it unquestioningly, making, perhaps, 
no nice scrutiny into its origin, or into its 
essential character. But to the fine sense of 
Mr. Martineau the taint of bribery clung to it 
still ; and there were, besides, other reasons 
why a decidedly scrupulous man must reject it. 
In the first place the Bounty was a " religious 
monopoly " it was a sum received from the 
taxation of all, but diverted to the benefit of 
a few. 

"The people gave ; only Presbyterians received. 
Quakers, Free-Thinkers, Catholics, were taxed with 
the rest, and for the support of a worship in which 
they did not participate and with which they had no 
sympathy. Were the question brought to those who pay 
this fund whether they would subscribe for the mainte- 
nance of Presbyterian worship, there could be no doubt 
of their refusal. It was not, therefore, a ' free-will 
offering,' but an exaction upon reluctant consciences." 

In the second place, Martineau conceived 
that his acceptance from the State of a stipend 
for which he did no service to the State was 
equivalent to the holding of a sinecure 
either that, or, were he, in his sacerdotal 
character, to earn the Bounty by doing service 
for it, a secularization of his office to which 
he could not be a party. Thirdly, State remun- 
eration seemed to him a bar to the progress 
of religious thought, for it created an obliga- 
tion, direct or implied, which must act as a 
check on the free utterance of opinion. 
Fourthly, State support of religion he held to 
be injurious to the " credit and influence of 
Christianity." It will be suspected that you

" hold for pay the faith you are paid merely 
for holding." In fine, Dr. Martineau concluded 
that one of two things must be : either the 
church must give up the Bounty, or else he 
and the church must part company. The 
first alternative was voted on by the congre- 
gation, and Dr. Martineau's party was defeated 
by one vote. 

From Dublin Dr. Martineau passed to the 
ministry of the Paradise Street Chapel at 
Liverpool, of which church he became sole 
pastor in 1835. In 1836 appeared his first 
original book, " The Rationale of Religious 
Inquiry " ; and in 1839 he was the leading 
champion of Unitarianism in the celebrated 
*' Liverpool Controversy " a spirited theo- 
logical battle royal which greatly delighted 
the contest-loving public, and of which Mr. 
Jackson gives an entertaining account. Dr. 
Martineau and his colleagues seem to have 
carried rather too many guns for their Anglican 
opponents, who drew away at the close of the 
combat in a badly riddled and demoralized, if 
not exactly sinking condition. 

In 1840 came Dr. Martiueau's appointment 
as Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy 
and Political Economy in Manchester New 
"College an event which " determined his 
life to Philosophy conjointly with Theology." 
His introductory lecture contained the follow- 
ing passage, which seems especially worth 
quoting in a day when " Anglo-Saxonism " is 
widely proclaimed as the final and choicer ex- 
pression of civilization, which may be propa- 
gated even with the sword. 

" Complaints are often made of the uncertain and 
shadowy results from all speculative science : and 
certainly it will construct no docks; lay no railways; 
weave no cotton; and, if civilization is to be measured 
exclusively by the scale and grandeur of its material 
elements, we can claim for our subject no large oper- 
ation on human improvement. To use the words of 
Novalis, . . . ' Philosophy can bake no bread ; but it 
can procure for us God, freedom, and immortality.' 
. . . What periods could be least well spared from 
the progress of civilization ? Surely, the golden ages 
of philosophy in Greece, and its revival in modern 
England, France, and Germany. What are the names, 
whose loss from the annals of our race would introduce 
the most terrible and dreary changes in its subsequent 
advance ? Those of Plato and Aristotle in the ancient 
world; of Bacon, Locke, and Kant in more recent 
times: and it is surely easier to conceive what we should 
have been without Homer, that without Socrates." 

In 1848 Dr. Martineau went to Germany, 
where he remained fifteen months, studying, 
mainly under Trendelenburg, logic and the 
history of philosophy, which led to Greek 
philosophical studies, the effect of which was, 



as he said, " a new intellectual birth." Ger- 
man Philosophy was of course not neglected 
at its fount. Mr. Jackson concludes : 

" The effect of these studies, however, was something 
more than enlarged knowledge; from their influence 
the deflection from the Necessarian view which Mill 
had detected reached to conscious and complete repu- 
diation. He was converted to that spiritual philosophy 
of which through all his toilsome life he was to be a 
fervid apostle." 

Manchester New College was moved to Lon- 
don in 1853 ; and in 1857 Dr. Martiueau, 
resigning from his Liverpool pastorate, went 
to the metropolis to give his whole time to the 
College. It was not until 1872, however, that 
he finally laid down his pulpit burden, by re- 
signing his office at Little Portland Street 
Chapel that modest, slimly-attended, ill-fur- 
nished little tabernacle where, said Sir Charles 
Lyell bitterly, " England hid her greatest 
preacher." 

In 1866 Dr. Martineau was the centre of a 
heated controversy, the occasion of which was 
his nomination to the chair of Logic and Mental 
Philosophy in University College. The pro- 
fessorial body were as a unit in his favor ; but 
in the Council bitter opposition was encoun- 
tered, led by George Grote. Of Dr. Marti- 
neau's fitness in point of attainments there was 
of course no question ; but the College was a 
secular foundation, and Dr. Martineau was a 
theologian, which was sufficient to prompt the 
hostility of Mr. Grote. He was, moreover, a 
Unitarian ; and this was sufficient to determine 
the opposition of a section of the Council who 
might perhaps have brooked a theologian had 
his divinity been of the orthodox stripe. The 
vote on the issue was a tie, and the chairman 
decided against Dr. Martineau. 

Mr. Jackson's version of the story of the 
estrangement between Dr. Martineau and his 
sister Harriet is interesting, and goes to show 
that the alienation was all on one side on the 
side, that is, of the brilliant and warm-hearted, 
if somewhat mutable and impetuous sister. 

Mr. Jackson has brought to his task special 
qualifications for it, and it was undertaken by 
him, we believe, with the warm approval of 
Dr. Martineau. His book is primarily one of 
scholarship and exposition ; but it is full of 
the traces of an independent and inquiring 
mind. As a Boswellian portrait it might well, 
we repeat, have been fuller. As a study of 
Dr. Martineau the religious teacher and the 
philosopher of religion it leaves little to be de- 
sired. The volume is well made, and contains 
a fine portrait of Dr. Martineau. E. G. J.

HISTORY or MODERN PHILOSOPHY.* 



The perfect historian of philosophy must 
unite in himself seemingly incompatible qual- 
ities. He must combine analytic acumen with 
patient erudition in a measure rarely found. 
Kant and Spinoza philology will avail him 
little if he has no genuine insight into the 
problems with which Kant and Spinoza strug- 
gled. And, on the other hand, there is in 
every philosophy a contingent and historical 
element which can be appreciated only by 
the methods of the historian and the philo- 
logian. 

Professor Hoffding of Copenhagen, author 
of the most recent of the many histories of 
philosophy that have been translated for the 
English public during the past two or three 
decades, perhaps more nearly fulfils these re- 
quirements than any of his predecessors. His 
" Elements of Psychology " is the sanest and 
clearest, as Professor James's is the most 
readable, comprehensive treatment of the sub- 
ject put forth in the past twenty years. It 
shows him to possess the indispensable quality 
of a firm grasp on the essential presuppositions 
of modern science without its too frequently 
accompanying drawback a hard, ignorant 
contempt for those who, in Aristotle's phrase, 
have disciplined the intelligence before us. 
" Consciously or unconsciously," he tells us 
in his Psychology, "philosophic speculation 
always works with psychological elements." 
And if this makes it helpful to a psychologist 
to have studied the history of philosophy, it 
makes it indispensable to the historian of phil- 
osophy that he should be a psychologist. On 
the historical side, Professor Hoffding has 
prepared himself for his task by numerous 
studies published during the past thirty years, 
including monographs on Montaigne, Spinoza, 
and Kant. Lastly, pending the improbable 
advent of an English history of Philosophy, 
it is for us a distinct recommendation that 
Professor Hoffding is a Dane, open to influ- 
ences from London as well as from Berlin, 
and so prepared to preserve a juster perspec- 
tive in the presentation of English and Ger- 
man thought than we find in the Erdmanns, 
the Ueberwegs, the Windelbands, and the 
Falckenbergs, on whom we have been com- 
pelled to rely. This is the first general history 
of philosophy in which there is adequate recog-

nition not only of Eighteenth century but of 
Nineteenth century English thought. Here 
at last Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel are reduced 
to something like their true proportions, and 
receive considerably less space than that as- 
signed to Mill, Darwin, and Spencer. It would 
be unreasonable to demand more, and regret 
that Professor Hoffding could not emancipate 
himself from the Kantian superstition, that 
last infirmity of the philosophic mind. For 
another generation at least, scholars will con- 
tinue to represent the " Critique of Pure Rea- 
son " as an epoch-making achievement, while 
deploring its artificial schematism, repudiat- 
ing its most characteristic distinctions and 
classifications, rejecting most of its distinc- 
tive doctrines, and pinching into pilulous ex- 
iguity the slight residuum of psychological 
truth. 

The history of modern philosophy has been 
written so often during the past sixty years 
that the story has become conventionalized. 
The transition from medievalism to the Re- 
naissance, the Italian forerunners of Bacon 
and Descartes, Cartesianism, and the other 
great constructive systems of the Seventeenth 
century, the critical and psychological school 
of English thought from Bacon and Hobbes to 
Locke and Berkeley and Hume, the relation 
of Kant to the problems which Hume raised, 
the speculative post-Kantian systems, and the 
new scientific positivism of Nineteenth century 
French and English thought, on all these 
topics very much the same things are said 
with slightly varying emphasis and coordina- 
tion in all of the chief histories now before the 
public. 

Professor Hbffding's distinctive merit is that 
he is throughout intelligible and sane. He is. 
by no means lacking in sympathy and appre- 
ciation for modes of thought opposed to hi* 
own. But he writes consistently from the 
point of view and in the terminology of a 
scientific thinker and psychologist of to-day. 
He thus escapes the sheer " clotted nonsense "" 
that results in some histories of philosophy 
from the partial and inconsistent adoption of 
the terminology of the system under discussion, 
or from the blending of that terminology with 
the language of some one of the modern post- 
Kantian systems of Germany. This may 
sometimes be a defect in the eyes of the pro- 
fessional student, who will learn more of the 
technique and the architecture of some of the 
great systems from Ueberweg or Erdmann. 
But it will be a great recommendation to the

general reader, who wishes to get at the cen- 
tral thought of Spinoza or Kant, and who 
cares nothing for the precise relation of the 
" modes" to the "attributes," or for the me- 
diating function of the transcendental sche- 
mata. 

Before reaching Descartes in the first vol- 
ume, Professor Hoffding devotes some two 
hundred pages to the philosophy of the Ren- 
naissance and the new birth of science. In 
these chapters he treats of the " discovery of 
man" by the humanists and the accompany- 
ing growth of the ideas of natural law and 
natural religion, of the new conception of the 
universe in Copernicus and Bruno, and the 
new methods of scientific investigation created 
foy Kepler and Galileo, and with many mis- 
understandings heralded by the rhetoric of 
Bacon. Notable is the emphasis laid on the 
political speculations of Machiavelli and the 
psychology of the great humanist Vives. In- 
deed, one of the chief merits of the work is 
the attention paid throughout to the progress 
of psychological analysis and the ethico-politi- 
cal theory of the state. The long chapter 
on Giordano Bruno is evidently a labor of 
love. Bacon, as is the fashion of the day, 
receives something less than justice. The 
chapters on the new conception of the world 
are introduced by a clear account of the 
Aristotelio-Media3val world*scheme. This is 
well as far as it goes. But the sharp contrast 
thus presented between the least valid part 
of the philosophy of Aristotle and the most 
brilliant achievement of the new science leaves 
an entirely exaggerated impression of the 
originality and independence of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth century thinkers. To prepare 
for a correct estimate in this matter, the his- 
tory of modern philosophy should be prefaced 
by similar resumes of the Aristotelian psychol- 
ogy, of the ethico-political philosophy of Plato's 
Republic " and Aristotle's " Politics," of the 
Stoic and Epicurean ethical and religious 
polemic as presented in Cicero, of every- 
thing, in short, which the great humanists 
took over from the philosophy of antiquity. 
Hoffding frequently discusses the claims of 
Galileo, Hobbes, Gassendi, and Descartes to 
Apriority in ideas or problems which must have 
'been the common possession of all scholars 
who had read the de Anima, Lucretius, Plato, 
and Diogenes Laertius. The chapter on Gas- 
sendi would have been a convenient place for 
such a treatment as we miss of the contribu- 
tion of ancient atomism to modern thought. 



This chapter is strangely inadequate. Hoffding 
does not, like Erdmann, in lofty superiority 
to the chronology, exclude Gassendi from the 
list of modern philosophers. He assigns him 
a chapter by the side of Descartes. But it 
consists of two pages, while Descartes receives 
forty. Yet, unless we are to hold that history 
makes no mistakes, and that the value of a 
philosopher is precisely proportional to the 
figure he has made in the history of letters, it 
is certain that Gassendi deserves no less con- 
sideration from the thoughtful historian than 
Descartes. He was right, and Descartes was 
wrong, on nearly every question with regard 
to which they differed. He states more clearly 
than Descartes many ideas for which Descartes 
and Hobbes are praised by Huxley and 
Hoffding. And his penetrating criticism com- 
pletely overthrew the speculative house of 
cards which Descartes erected to divert the 
attention of the church, and which is his 
chief claim to a place in the history of 
philosophy. But Gassendi's work is hidden 
away in ponderous Latin tomes, while Des- 
cartes' " Discourse of Method " caught and 
kept the ear of the public, and his cleverly 
advertised system, by the very transparency 
of the artifices of its construction, provoked 
and facilitated the logomachies which gave 
it notoriety. It may be observed, in passing, 
that the statement for which no authority 
is given, that Gassendi attributed sentiency 
to the atoms, is apparently based on the 
first edition of Lange's "History of Mate- 
rialism." In the second edition Lange with- 
drew it. 

Professor Hoffding gives an excellent untech- 
nical description of the great seventeenth cen- 
tury systems of Descartes, Spinoza, and Leib- 
nitz, whom he evidently admires more than any 
other group of speculative thinkers. That is a 
matter of taste. They do gratify the common- 
place metaphysical instinct for ingenious sys- 
tem building, and Spinoza in addition to this 
appeals strongly to some minds on the ethical 
and religious side by his peculiar " blend " of 
mathematical austerity with cosmic emotion. 
But apart from the specific scientific achieve- 
ments of Descartes and Leibnitz, the seven- 
teenth century systems are worth to us pre- 
cisely what they may contain of sound psycho- 
logical and ethical analysis and no more. 
And it may be a paradox, but it is hardly an 
exaggeration to say that they might all be 
eliminated without seriously affecting the prog- 
ress of genuine philosophic thought through

THE DIAL 



Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and their 
nineteenth century successors. What engages 
the attention and arouses the enthusiasm of the 
student here is precisely what impressed Cicero 
in the artificial constructions of the Stoics 
the ingenuity of the terminology, " the admir- 
able coherence and consecution of ideas, the 
correspondence of beginning, middle, and end." 
The Stoic system and terminology dominated 
in the literary world for five centuries. But it 
was embodied in no book that the world would 
not willingly let die, and now it survives merely 
as the memory of a mood, a temper in the 
reception of experience on the part of its later 
nominal Roman disciples. And such will be 
the fate of all systems of philosophy as such. 
It is the great book that lives, not the ingen- 
ious system. 

Professor Hbffding's admiration for the 
Cartesians does not prevent his doing ample 
justice to the English and French thought of 
the eighteenth century. The long chapter on 
Rousseau shows how far he is from identifying 
philosophy with metaphysical system building. 
For the great post-Kantian constructive sys- 
tems, he evidently feels an imperfect sympathy 
partly, perhaps, because he holds that there 
is no excuse for further dogmatizing about the 
Absolute after Kant. Fichte, Schelling, and 
Hegel, I cheerfully abandon to him. But I 
must protest against his treatment of Schopen- 
hauer, though it is fairer than that found in 
the ordinary history of philosophy. Professor 
Hoffding here forgets the principle laid down 
in his preface, that an inconsequence in a great 
thinker is often nothing but the natural conse- 
quence of the fact, that his genius displays 
itself in several lines of thought. Schopen- 
hauer was only thirty years old when he wrote 
Die Welt als Wille; and the example of Fichte, 
Schelling, and Hegel made it inevitable that 
the ambitious young man should throw his own 
ideas into the form of a systematic construction. 
A good dialectician can drive a coach-and-four 
through the system ; but the book is none the 
less a masterpiece of literary architectonics. 
This framework Schopenhauer used for the 
setting of all his subsequent thought and 
writing. But this in no wise detracts from 
the infinite wealth and suggestiveness of his 
thought. 

M. Brunetiere said, several years ago, that 
when the literary account of the century was 
summed up, Schopenhauer would be found to 
have influenced the higher thought of the 
age more than any other one philosopher. If 



we leave out of account the body of thought 
which English readers associate with the names 
of Darwin, Spencer, and Huxley, which can 
hardly be appropriated to any one thinker, 
the prediction is in a fair way to be verified. 
There are whole ranges of ideas with regard 
to the life of the emotions and the will in 
which we are all disciples of Schopenhauer. 
And if anything could justify his cynical view 
of the philosophic guild, it would be their 
persistent habit of appropriating his essential 
thoughts while diverting the reader's attention 
to the flaws in his character and the external 
inconsistencies of his system. Schopenhauer's 
fame, however, will take care of itself. There 
are fundamentally just two classes of philos- 
ophers those whom posterity can read, and 
those whom it cannot and will not read. He 
belongs to the first class, whose influence is 
cumulative, while the others exist only in the 
histories of philosophy. 

Of the thought of Mill, Darwin, and Spen- 
cer, Professor Hoffding gives an excellent 
analysis, equally removed from the slavish 
adhesion of the disciple, and the wilful mis- 
understanding of the Oxford neo-Kantian who 
undertakes to demolish the philosophy of evo- 
lution. A short book on modern German 
philosophy from 1850 to 1880 concludes what 
is, taken all in all, the sanest and most readable 
History of Philosophy yet written. 

The translation of this work is no worse 
than the average performance in this kind, 
and seems perhaps better because no process 
of "upsetting" can convert Professor Hoff- 
ding's comparatively short and lucid sentences 
into the " pure, definite, and highly finished 
nonsense " which results from the attempt to 
english Erdmann's account of Hegel. It 
presents several baffling mistakes, such as 
finite " for final (Vol. I., p. 231), " barred 
the way " for prepared the way (p. 473), and 
the use of spiritualistic (p. 235). Misprints 
are altogether too frequent. " Memotechnical " 
(sic) (p. 131), " inventionum " for inven- 
tionem (p. 265), " fractum " for pactum 
(p. 283), "citus" for citius (p. 198), " Telsio " 
for Telesio (p. 100), " Plautinus " for Plo- 
tinus (p. 519), "Trivlens" for Tvivlens 
(p. 503). The dates also are too often 
wrong. Kant's first publication was in 1755, 
not in 1775 ; Schelling was called to Berlin in 
1841, not in 1861, and Schleiermacher was 
not delivering addresses or writing letters 
in this world in 1881-2.

A DAUGHTER OF THE REIGN OF TERROR.* 

It is not often that the attention of students 
of the French Revolution is diverted from 
Paris, the great central stage on which that 
awful tragedy of blood and fire was mainly 
enacted. As early as the end of the seven- 
teenth century, the great city on the Seine not 
only dominated the provinces but eclipsed and 
hid them from view. That fine old conception 
of Louis XIV., that he was the State, made 
him jealous of the growing power of his cap- 
ital, and led him to various attempts to curtail 
its prosperity ; but the establishment of his 
court at Versailles served to defeat the purpose 
of the Grand Monarque. In 1740 Montesquieu 
could say to a friend, " France is nothing but 
Paris and a few distant provinces which Paris 
has not yet had time to swallow " a saying 
which the philosophic De Tocqueville, a cen- 
tury later, pruned down into the epigram, 
" At the time of the Fronde, Paris was nothing 
but the largest French city: in 1789 it was 
France." 

It is hardly surprising, then, that the young 
readers of Carlyle or Thiers or Guizot should 
have Parisian dates and names so burned in 
upon their consciousness as to fancy that there 
were no days of horror but the Tenth of 
August, the Second of September, the Twenty- 
first of January no Jacobins but those of 
Paris no Terror save that of the Concier- 
gerie and the Place de la Revolution. The 
desolations of Nantes, Toulon, Marseilles, 
Lyons, La Vendee, are scarce-heard minor 
plaints in the mighty burden of the central 
Babylon. 

The narrative now before us, in which Paris 
is hardly mentioned, will help to correct this 
error in perspective, and to show that these 
provincial communities, " over which," in 
Carlyle's words, " History can cast only glances 
from aloft," yet writhed through their full 
proportionate share of the misery inflicted in 
the name of Liberty. The book is the simple, 
unaffected story of a young gentlewoman, 
Mdlle. Alexandrine des Echerolles, whose 
father, M. Giraud des Echerolles, had an 
estate near Moulins in the Nivernais. At the 
outbreak of the Revolution he was violently 
dispossessed of his property, and with his sister 
and daughter sought refuge in Lyons, which 
at that time was strongly anti-revolutionary in

the French by Marie Clothilde Balfour. New York : John

feeling, and on the verge of revolt against the 
Convention government in Paris. Alexandrine 
(whose mother had happily died before these 
calamities) was a gentle child of thirteen, and 
passionately attached to her aunt, whose heroic 
and self-sacrificing nature fully deserved all 
her devotion. The young girl was soon matured 
into a heroine by the forcing process of per- 
secution. Together with her father and aunt, 
she underwent the suspense and privations of 
the siege of Lyons by the revolutionary forces. 
When the city fell (October 9, 1793), she 
was carried into another and more dismal circle 
of the Inferno. M. des Echerolles was relent- 
lessly hunted, only escaping by a series of 
hairbreadth adventures ; and the beloved aunt 
was arrested and imprisoned. Their poor 
apartments had been " sequestrated " and 
placed under the charge of a certain Citizen 
Foret ; and there poor little Alexandrine was 
left to face the situation as best she might. 
The Terror now began grimly enough in Lyons ; 
the guillotine " went " as gaily as in Paris ; 
and its too-slow work was supplemented by the 
wholesale Fusillades (which, curiously enough, 
Alexandrine does not seem to have noticed). 
On the 22d Pluviose, Year II. (February 11, 
1794), the crushing blow fell ; the guillotine 
claimed Mdlle. des Echerolles, and Heaven 
seemed indeed to have deserted her unhappy 
niece. Yet by degrees new friends were found, 
old friends cautiously reappeared ; and Alex- 
andrine found her way back to the home of 
her childhood, where for a while she was per- 
mitted to dwell, under pretty close surveillance. 
A temporary revival of the Terror again drove 
her father into hiding, and imposed fresh in- 
dignities upon herself. She managed to live 
through them all, and might reasonably have 
expected a better return from her father for 
her devotion than the announcement that 
at the age of seventy-four he was to marry 
again. The prospective bride, who was fifty, 
was a kindly, sensible woman ; but the blow 
was a heavy one, and meant once more exile ; 
so now Alexandrine turned her steps to Paris, 
where a position was found for her as com- 
panion to an afflicted lady, who in her lucid 
intervals proved a kind and considerate friend. 
In 1807 Mdlle. des Echerolles, now twenty- 
eight years of age, was tendered the post of 
governess to the daughters of the Duchess 
Louis of Wiirtemberg. The offer was accepted, 
and the young Frenchwoman bade farewell to 
her native land forever. In her own words, 
" I attached myself promptly to the four

princesses confided to my care, and my life 
was thenceforward a happy one ; I have grown 
old in this august house, loaded with favors 
in which my family has shared." 

She lived until 1850, and was thus enabled 
thoroughly to revise her memoirs ; the first 
edition of which, under the title of " Quelques 
Annees de ma Vie," is said to have been issued 
in 1793, at Moulins, i. e., before the removal 
to Lyons. The bulk of the work, therefore, 
must have been the fruit of later years' labor. 
An edition, with a preface by Rene de Les- 
pinasse, was published in 1879 ; and this is 
the original of the very excellent translation, 
which now lies before us, by Marie Clothilde 
Balfour. 

Originally composed for a small circle of 
friends, the narrative has the frankness and 
spontaneity of a journal intime. Of art there 
is none, unless it be the art of concealing art. 
Moralizing is abundant, after the fashion of 
the times; and the author's piety was genuine 
enough to be a real help in time of need. She 
has no political views to expound ; her interest 
in her surroundings is entirely domestic ; her 
eyes throughout are bent upon her appointed 
task of tracing the thread of the family mis- 
fortunes through the terribly tangled web of 
the Reign of Terror. Like Boswell, she has 
unconsciously made a great book, and her 
" ower true tale " will successfully challenge 
the output of the modern vein of romantic 
fiction. 

Mrs. (or Miss) Balfour has given us a 
spirited translation, preserving in large meas- 
ure the naivete of the original, and bringing 
us everywhere face to face with the gentle but 
resolute and cheerful personality of her author. 
There are some small but perplexing discrep- 
ancies in dates which should have been ad- 
justed ; and one slip of this kind is made by 
the translator herself in a footnote on p. 232, 
where she fails to correct the error of the text 
putting the execution of Louis XVI. on the 
17th of January instead of the 21st. A few 
infelicities may be noticed : " ignored " (p. 
115) is retained in its archaic English sense; 
radiation " (p. 289) and " brigade " (p. 256) 
are not true translations, and " savoury " 
(p. 98) is an adjective in English. The pub- 
lisher has maintained the reputation of the 
Bodley Head by giving the work a vivid 
typography and a rich emblematic cover, 
making it a joy to behold and a comfort to 
read.

RECENT POETRY.* 



The poetry of the last few months is not remark- 
able in quantity or in quality. Out of perhaps thirty 
volumes we have selected a dozen that seem to de- 
serve mention, hut no one of them rises above the 
level of minor verse, and the best of their contents 
is derivative. The most important of the twelve 
is " The Choice of Achilles, and Other Poems," by 
Mr. Arthur Gray Butler. 

" Long life and ease, or glory and the grave ?" 
These are the alternatives between which the hero 
of the Iliad has to choose, as he debates with him- 
self whether or not he shall join the Trojan expe- 
dition. 

" Oh [ for an oracle 

To sound above these tortures of the mind. 
And strike their brawling silent ! Never yet 
Since deepening manhood darkened first these lips, 
Bringing the larger choices of the soul, 
I doubted so before." 

When the choice is made, it is voiced in these ring- 
ing words: 

" Gome then ! Who is for life, let him live here ! 
Who is for death and glory, let him go, 
And mount to heaven, and add a star to fame, 
Not setting like the sea-washed Pleiades ; 
Quick to the port ! Across the crisping waves 
Our prows point seaward, point the Asian shore : 
Achilles wakes, is on his way to Troy." 

" The Choice of Achilles " lies between strenuous 
conflict and inglorious ease ; " The Choice of 
Heracles" lies between sensuous gratification and 
devoted toil. And in the second case, as in the 
first, the heart 

"Thus nobly wooed, with mighty transport filled, 
Knew its own nobleness, and put forth strength, 
Like oaks in old Dodona, seat of Gods, 
When mounts the sap in springtime." 

So the hero girds himself for his labors, and be- 
comes the "helper of the world."

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



"Then forth he fared, calm and resolved, not loud 
In vaunting, nor with fire of self -applause 
Deceitful stirred ; but silent, steadfast, calm, 
Knowing: his old self dead, yet of the new 
Not certain, more in ignorance than in fear : 
As when a minstrel takes a harp new strung, 
And strikes the strings with trembling, lest they make 
Discordant music, but he finds them true : 
And then henceforth upon the ears of men 
Grows a new strain, melodious, liquid, pure, 
Sweet, ordered, heavenly, Nature's hymn of praise, 
Like that which kindled first the Orphean lyre ; 
And still that song, when ended, yet lives on 
Hid in men's souls, and, buried for a while, 
Wells forth anon in music, in some spring, 
Maytime of hearts ; and, as a call divine, 
It wakes a singer here, a singer there, 
Till earth is filled with singing : and the spheres 
Listen above : ('t was thence the wonder came 
To heal our jars ;) and from concordant throats 
Swells up one strain of faultless harmony." 

These two noble poems occupy the forefront of Mr. 
Butler's volume, and have not a little of the grave 
cadence of the master who has so evidently inspired 
them. Another classical echo, in a different key, is 
heard in the lines called " Sunt Lacrym." 

" But song more sweet shall never twine 
The rue and rose in one short line ; 
Or more pathetic give to grief 
An outlet, for a moment brief, 
To loose awhile the captive woe 
Whose prisoned drops refuse to flow ; 
And, like a draught of myrrh in wine, 
To mix in tears an anodyne ; 
Than in that world's epitome, 
Sad Virgil's sweet ' Sunt lacrymse.' " 

We must find space for one more illustration of Mr. 
Butler's finished and tender-hearted verse, and it is 
found in what is easily the gem of the collection, 
in the faultless lyric called " Peace." 

"Winds and wild waves in headlong huge commotion 

Scud, dark with tempest, o'er the Atlantic's breast ; 
While, underneath, few fathoms deep in ocean, 
Lie peace and rest. 

"Storms in mid-air, the rack before them sweeping, 

Hurry and hiss, like demons hate-possessed ; 
While, over all, white cloudlets pure are sleeping 
In peace, in rest. 

" Heart, O wild heart, why in the storm-world ranging, 

Flit'st thou thus midway, passion's slave and jest, 
When all so near, below, above, unchanging 
Are heaven, and rest?" 

The note of revery, of retrospect tinged with 
melancholy, is the prevailing note of " The Living 
Past and Other Poems," by Mr. Thomas Seton 
Jevons. It is struck clearly enough on the opening 
page. 

"And now the lilac blooms ; I pluck a sprig, 
And in the blossoms find and seem to see 
Familiar faces that are gone before 
Gone to return with each returning Spring. 
About the porch the silent ivies cling, 
And in the distant grove the robins wildly sing ; 
Cling till the walls are mouldered ; sing till love 
Of singing bursts those red blood-tinctured throats, 
And down the twilight breeze the echo, dying, floats. 
Now they are gone, and I alone remain, 
And all the world's wild music is in vain, 
Its speech is sorrow and its song is pain." 



The writer does little more than frame variations 
upon the sentiment of these verses in the subsequent 
pages. It is but a forced resignation that nature 
wrings from his soul, and his yearning for the van- 
ished past is still in the poignant stage, has not 
given place to a calm acceptance of the decrees of 
fate. It is all very touching and very sincere, and 
its turbulence of emotion has a strange power of 
impressing itself upon the mood of the reader. 

For the second time, Dr. Henry van Dyke has 
gathered a slender sheaf of verses into a book, 
which he has entitled " The Toiling of Felix," from 
the principal piece in the collection. This poem is 
a fanciful legend, based upon a text from the 
"Logia" found at Oxyrhynchus, and is just the 
sort of gentle verse that Longfellow might have 
written upon such a theme. Good fisherman that 
he is, for other capture than souls, the author gives 
us also a few angling lyrics, from which we take 
this graceful bit : 

" There 's wild azalea on the hill, and roses down the dell, 
And just one spray of lilac still abloom beside the well ; 
The columbine adorns the rocks, the laurel buds grow pink, 
Along the stream white arums gleam, and violets bend to 

drink." 

So alluring a picture as that should entice the lover 
of nature forth, even if not intent upon killing some- 
thing. " The River of Dreams " is the best poem in 
this volume, and we quote the last of its seven sec- 
tions : 

" The river of dreams runs silently down 
By a secret way that no man knows ; 
But the soul lives on while the dream-tide flows 
Through the gardens bright, or the forests brown ; 
And I think sometimes that our whole life seems 
To be more than half made up of dreams, 
For its changing sights, and its passing shows, 
And its morning hopes, and its midnight fears, 
Are left behind with the vanished years. 
Onward, with ceaseless motion. 
The life-stream flows to the ocean, 
And we follow the tide, awake or asleep, 
Till we see the dawn on Love's great deep, 
When the bar at the harbour-mouth is crossed, 
And the river of dreams in the sea is lost." 

" This is a practical age and it longs for a prac- 
tical poet," says Mr. Harry Thurston Peck by way 
of introduction to the lengthy study in hexameters 
which comes at the end of "Greystone and Por- 
phyry," his recently-published volume of verse. In 
pursuance of this suggestion, the poem goes on to 
discourse of actual life in terms of the most uncom- 
promising realism. 

" Ye who seek for applause from a matter-of-fact generation 
Follow for once and all the curious cult of the Ugly, 
Turn to the bold-faced jig who, cased in follicular bloomers, 
Straddles the wind-puffed wheel ; to the nymphs who are- 
loved by the coster, 

Smut-faced factory girls with voices husky and raucous. 
Hair soot-sifted, hands black-nailed and roughened and 

warty 
These be the poet's theme." 

The satire is grim enough, and is pushed home with 
a persistent energy that for the moment almost 
persuades us that all sentiment is sickly and all 
idealism illusive. Luckily, the antidote for this 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



231 



cynicism may be found close at hand, in such a 
poem as " Love, It Is Night " too long to quote 
in full and almost too lovely to mutilate 

" Dimmed into dusk the flame-clouds disappear, 

The homing bird sweeps low in circling flight, 
And distant bells come faintly to the ear 
Love, it is night. 

" Now that the world is hushed in sombre grey, 

Stand not apart nor shut me from your sight ; 
One little word is all I have to say 
Love, it is night." 

The note of yearning, of pathetic regret for an 
irrecoverable past, breathes through this poem, as 
well as through others in the collection. Its ac- 
cent is less tragic, but not less deep, in such verses 
as " Heliotrope," which tell how " the sound of a 
voice that is still " yet thrills the soul of the scholar 
who, for all his fame, has missed the best gift 
of life. 

" And he had learned, among his books 

That held the lore of ages olden, 
To watch those ever-changing looks, 
The wistful eyes, the tresses golden, 
That stirred his pulse with passion's pain 

And thrilled his soul with soft desire, 
And bade fond youth return again, 
Crowned with its coronet of fire." 

We are glad that Mr. Peck is not the " practical 
poet " of his own imagining ; the strength and ten- 
derness of most of the pieces here published mark 
him for an idealist at heart, in spite of the flippancy 
which he at times affects. 

Dr. Weir Mitchell's verse is always graceful in 
diction and scholarly in content, and his latest vol- 
ume, "The Wager and Other Poems," while it 
contains nothing particularly impressive, makes a 
pleasant addition to the long list of his published 
volumes. " The Wager " is a dramatic composition 
in a single act, with a romantic French setting of 
the seventeenth century. Both the blank verse and 
the interspersed lyrics are admirable. The poem 
which we like best is " The Sea Gull," with its bur- 
den of haunting and melancholy beauty. Here are 
three stanzas : 

" Thine is the heritage of simple things, 
The untasked liberty of sea and air, 
Some tender yearning for the peopled nest, 
Thy only freight of care. 

" Thou hast no forecast of the morrow's need, 

No bitter memory of yesterdays ; 
Nor stirs thy thought that airy sea o'erhead, 
Nor ocean's soundless ways. 

"Thou silent raider of the abounding sea, 

Intent and resolute, ah, who may guess 
What primal notes of gladness thou hast lost 
In this vast loneliness." 

The contents of Mr. Robert Loveman's new 
" Book of Verses " are very simple things indeed. 
His flights rarely exceed a dozen lines at a time, 
but within that compass he often succeeds in 
expressing a pretty conceit or a graceful fancy. 
"Behind the Scenes" maybe taken as a typical 
example : 



" Behind the scenes the kings and queens 
Are merely mortals ; Juliet leans, 
A tired girl, against the screens, 
Behind the scenes. 

" The final act is on, and lo ! 
The loving heart of Romeo 
Must crack with misery and woe ; 
The noble Paris, too, shall die, 

" And tears spring up in every eye ; 
Then exit all, while rogue and saint 
Are scrubbing off the mask of paint, 
Behind the scenes." 

This is magazine verse of modest merit, and de- 
serves a word of modest praise. 

Mr. Horace Spencer Fiske is the author of a 
volume of verses, some of which are merely trivial, 
while others rise to the dignity of lofty utterance 
inspired by happily-chosen themes. The sonnet 
form is that in which Mr. Fiske does his best work, 
and his sonnets outnumber his other pieces. They 
are for the most part occasional, suggested by works 
of art or literature. " The Bronze Horses of St. 
Mark's " may be taken as a characteristic example. 

" Triumphal horses that so long ago 

Beside the Bosphorus their chariot drew 
Till that blind victor doge their beauty knew, 

And snatched from out the city's overthrow : 

Six centuries of sunset did they glow 
Fair as Apollo's horses to the view, 
When swift adown the westering slopes of blue 

They flash to drink the night's deep overflow. 

But splendid war-steeds still the victor's eye 
Alluring, they must stand beside the Seine, 

A soldier's ruthless dream to glorify 
Until he fell ; and they once more might gain 

That place of peace within the sunset sky 
Where pigeons coo the saint's resplendent fane." 

Mr. Fiske's verse is grouped under several catego- 
ries. " College Verse," " Chicago Verse," " Son- 
nets on Sculpture," and " Sonnets on Shakspeare " 
are four of the chief sections. The volume is enti- 
tled "The Ballad of Manila Bay and Other Verses," 
but we care less for the titular poem and the accom- 
panying ballad, " The Charge of San Juan," than 
for most of the other contents. If " of Roosevelt's 
Rough Riders the fame grows never old," there are 
some, at least, who wish that it might, in view of 
subsequent developments. And the refrain of the 
titular ballad gives us pause, for it runs : 
"And men by a million hearth-fires shall tell of Manila Bay 

How Dewey swept past the forts at night, 

And struck the Dons in the flushing light, 
And for freedom won the day." 

If the day only had been won for freedom, as the 
poet fondly imagined when he wrote these lines ! 
But it seems to have been won instead, temporarily 
at least, for a despotism no more deserving than 
that which it overthrew. America can never take 
genuine pride in that brilliant achievement as 
long as it shall seem to have been tainted with un- 
worthy motives with treachery toward an unsus- 
picious ally, with the lust of conquest and base 
commercial greed.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Mr. William P. Trent, in the volume of "Verses " 
that he has recently given to the public, strikes a 
truer ethical note in his treatment of our unfortu- 
nate war with Spain. 

" Yet wherefore should the race that hunts thee down 

Insult thee in thy fall ? 
Merely to seize and wear thy ancient crown 
Is not the end of all. 

" Have we acknowledged Wisdom for our queen? 

Do we possess our minds 
In joy and faith and love and peace serene ? 
Or do the evil winds 

1 ' Of passion beat upon our foreheads now 

As erst on thine, O Spain ? 
Shall we before no gilded idol bow ? 
Shall we secure remain 

"From ignorance and cruelty and lust 

Of splendor and of power ? 
God, in whom alone is perfect trust, 
What clouds are these that lower ? 

Mr. Trent's verses are in many respects highly 
satisfactory. While they are not all that we could 
wish them to he in technical craftmanship, they are 
the expression of a finely-cultured and an essentially 
poetic mind, always aiming at high ideals, and 
often finding just the words that are needed by the 
thought. Of the longer poems with which the col- 
lection begins, " Sataspes," suggested by a passage 
in Herodotus, is one of the best, but it would be 
still better if the author had given himself more 
room. "Corydon," which is an elegy upon the 
death of Matthew Arnold, is a noble poem, and we 
wish that we had space for more than the closing 
stanza : 

" But thee, O Corydon, shall the gracious light 
Cheer not on earth, and if, as thou didst sing, 

Man's life is bounded by oblivion's night, 
Thou hast the dark forever. Not the spring 
Rising from winter's grave to thee could bring 

Authentic tidings of a world that lies 
Beyond the shadows that dark planets fling 

On this low earth of ours. Art thon more wise, 

O master, now, and hast thon seen it with thine eyes ?' ' 

It is rather noteworthy that the two finest elegiac 
tributes to Arnold should have come from Amer- 
ica, but we have seen no others that equal this by 
Mr. Trent and Mr. Carman's " Death in April." 
Mr. Trent's " Souvenirs of Travel " include several 
charming compositions, among which " Assisi " is 
probably the best. 

" Thou little town amid the Umbrian hills, 

Methinks thou liest in shadows all the day 
Some ghostly'! presence, is it not, that fills 

Thy narrow streets and crumbling houses gray ?" 

" Ah yes ! his saintly shade that long ago 

Loved nature through and through from man to clod 
Then what to thee the noontide's flaunting glow, 
Assisi, where St. Francis walked with God ?" 

Mr. Trent writes excellent sonnets, and some of 
them will be remembered by readers of THE DIAL, 
for they made their first appearance in our pages 
If we must make a choice among them, it shall be 
" The Isles of Rest." 



" Ah me ! the pity of this great world's past, 
The causes lost, the sighs, the fallen tears, 
The slow, blind rolling of the heavy years. 
And all the dark unmeaning shadows cast ! 
Canst thou not see the sad procession vast 
Of them that strove with fortune mighty peers, 
Bearing their crowns or scrolls or harps or spears 
Only to lay them down and die at last ? J 

" Peace, fool, behold that calm sea on whose breast 
The souls of them that fought at Troy of old 

Were wafted till they reached the Isles of Rest 
That lifted from the waves their sands of gold, 

Whence sprung the palms beneath whose shade the Blest 
Of earthly lives serene the story told." 

" A Garland of Sonnets," by Mr. Craven Lang- 
stroth Betts, consists of thirty-three tributes to as 
many poets, couched in terms of conventional 
praise, but revealing little insight, and not in any 
way remarkable for felicity of expression. William 
Morris is thus apostrophized, and the sonnet fairly 
represents the average quality of the collection : 

" Chaucer and Spencer, gather him to your heart, 
The burly Radical of dreamy rhyme ! 
And crown him with the Trouvere's bay sublime, 
That ne'er till now had graced the British mart ; 
For even to him the story-teller's art 
Came glamorous out of Fancy's buoyant clime, 
The mintage of that golden ore of time 
From the world's childhood ; for he voiced in part 
Your mid-sea swaying melodies, the breath 
Of pastoral lands, of flowry meads, and meres, 
And your pale, poignant picturing of death, 
And your dear, tender ruth for love in tears. 
No idle singer he, whate'er he saith ; 
His pilgrim torch relumes the shadowed years ! " 

Mr. Edward Robeson Taylor, in his "Moods 
and Other Verses," has also inscribed sonnets to a 
great many poets, among them the French poet of 
" Les Trophies," whose own sonnets he has trans- 
lated into English. Here are the lines devoted to 
M. de He're'dia: 

" 'Twas eagle-winged, imperial Pindar, who 
Sent down the ages on the tide of song 
The thought that only to the years belong 
Those deeds that win immortal poets' due. 
Still rise his crowned athletes to the new, 
On his unwearied pinions borne along ; 
Still shepherds' pipe and lay sound sweet and strong 
As when Theocritus attuned them true. 
And so through thee, the feats of heroes great, 
The hues of life of other times than ours, 
With such refulgence in thy sonnets glow. 
That in the splendor of their new estate, 
They there, with deathless Art's supernal powers, 
Shall o'er the centuries enchantments throw." 

It is impossible to find anything to praise in such 
verse as this. It is commonplace in ornament and 
wooden in resonance. Yet it is as good verse as 
we can find in the two hundred varied pages of 
Mr. Taylor's volume. 

There is some lovely verse in "The Search of 
Ceres, and Other Poems," by Mrs. Sarah Warner 
Brooks. The writer has an old-fashioned way of 
saying things simply and effectively, and her tech- 
nique is for the most part admirable, although the 
ear is now and then vexed by a redundant line. 
" Foretold " is a short poem in which the writer's 
powers are exhibited at their best: 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



233 



44 How went with thee, dear heart, the laggard years unblest 
Ere we two met ? Alack ! no skill have I to see. 
I can but know, sweet, that (their prescience guessed) 
All my life's days were then but prophecies of thee. 
Thy being thrilled my maidenhood from far 
As winds unseen thrill aspen leaves. The sea 
Sang of thee : Autumn, rustling through her ripened 

sheaves, 

Old Winter, drowsing numbly neath his snows, 
Spring, with blown lilacs, in clear monotone. 
And Summer, drunk with new wine of the rose, 
Foretold thy advent : and in solemn joy, alone, 
Yearning, I waited, till my heart beat fast 
Hearing what way thy love-led footsteps went ; 
And then I knew that God was good. Life flowered 

at last ! 
I looked into thine eyes, belov'd, and was content." 

There are a number of memorial pieces in this 
volume, of which the best seems to be the irregular 
sonnet addressed to the memory of William E. 
Russell : 

''.With poised stars his steadfast soul kept pace, 

And all his life was clean as snows untrod ; 
For, ever as a flint he set his face 

For righteousness and duty, truth and Ood ! 
Bruised in a Circean herd's unseemly strife, 

Like the hurt deer, he sought green shades of rest, 
Cooling the fevered pulses of his life 

On the great Mother's ever-healing breast. 
Then to his couch of dreams, at hush of night, 

An angel bore sooth poppies, fringed and white : 
Softly he laid them on his quiet eyes, 

And, like a lover, kissed away his breath, 
And dreaming on, he woke in Paradise 
Immortal ! And knew not the face of Death ! " 

-"The Search of Ceres " is a charming poem, in an 
original stanzaic form, of which an illustration 
may be given : 

" Night swept her sables through the vale, 
Above hung Hesper, calm and pale, 
In bosky depths a nightingale 
Her fleeting hushed before my wail, 
As, crazed with woe, I sought for thee, 

Persephone, Persephone ! " 

The queen of the under-world is also taken as 
the subject of two poems in the " Sylva " of Miss 
Elizabeth G. Crane. From the first of them, tell- 
ing of Proserpine's first return to earth, the fol- 
lowing verses are taken : 

" Before her now the gates of Tartarus 
Swung grudging wide, while every churlish bolt 
Shrieked out upon her, but she passed up, up, 
Inhaling through glad nostrils the fresh smell 
Of genial earth, whose lap with[new growth teemed ; 
For all the spring yearned in her blood|till she 
Broke through the earth with flowers, embraced and fell 
At golden Ceres' feet, and withfquick touch 
Her winter mourning changed to summer joy." 

The writer's fondness for classical themes is again 
evinced in the exquisite poem, "Marpessa to 
Apollo," suggested by the masterpiece of Mr. 
Stephen Phillips. The group of irregular sonnets 
at the close of the volume provides us with the 
following extract, in which the writer appears at 
her best : 

" Dost thou remember how a silence fell 

Between us when beneath the stars we stood ? 
Our light talk dropped, above it, we knew well, 

Swept ever on love's strong and silent flood 



Drawing us each to each, though not one word 

We spoke of love. Pale grew the rosy west, 
Earth deeply breathed in slumber, ocean heard, 

With answering murmurs gently her caressed, 
The flowers sighed softly to the wooing wind, 

The maiden moon sank in a cloud's embrace ; 
When love moved all things, did not nature kind 

Speak for us both ? Thy soul sprang to thy face, 
Imperious summoned mine to pay love's debt ; 

As mine flashed back love's answer, our lips met." 

There is much delicate feeling, and no little of 
technical mastery, in the little volume that has 
yielded us the above quotations.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Among the " Stories of the Nations " 
S. 8eries (Ptnam) unusual interest at- 

taches at the present moment to the 
monograph on Italy by Professor Pietro Orsi. The 
author is an Italian scholar of note, a professor of 
history in R. Liceo Foscarini, Venice, and a keen 
student of contemporaneous events and conditions. 
His present work, though limited in scope, fur- 
nishes excellent reading for anyone wishing to profit 
by an educated Italian's studies of his country's 
history and its future. An interesting departure 
from the commonly accepted point of view lies in 
the credit given to distinctly literary men, not di- 
rectly engaged in political affairs, for their efforts 
in behalf of Italian unity in the first half of the 
present century. In every field of literature men 
were to be found who gave their best efforts and all 
their energy to the betterment of political condi- 
tions in Italy. These writers held diverse views 
and were interested in different projects, yet their 
influence was steadily directed toward increasing 
among the Italian people the desire for Italian unity 
under some form. Thus the Neo-Guelph party, 
which would have had Italy a federated state with 
the Pope as president, was founded as the result of 
the writings of Vincenzo Gioberti, " the prophet of 
the revolution of 1848." Sardinia was urged as 
the natural and necessary centre of the future state 
by Cesare Balbo in his Speranze D* Italia. Re- 
publicanism, pure and simple, found its chief 
exponent, of course, in Mazzini, but others less in- 
tensely political by nature contributed to its pro- 
gress, as when the actor, Gustavo Modena, recited 
to enthusiastic audiences Silvio Pellico's Francesca 
Da Rimini. The tragedies of Niccolini, Massimo 
D'Azeglio's Ultimi Casa Di JRomagna, deprecating 
violence but bitterly attacking the papal govern- 
ment, the works of the patriotic poets, Giovanni 
Berchet and Mercatini, all served to maintain and 
to increase popular fervor for some form of national 
unity, and are recognized as constituting an im- 
portant factor in the development of the modern 
state. After 1859 the men of action take the front 
of the stage, and a brief account is given of polit-

ical changes since that time. Political leaders are 
gently criticised and riotous disturbances deplored, 
but in these latter the author finds no cause for be- 
lieving that the Italian people are weary of union, 
or that the state is about to fall to pieces. They 
are rather caused by economic troubles specifically 
demanding readjustment by the united govern- 
ment, not tending to overthrow it. Even of the 
long standing quarrel between Pope and King, the 
view is expressed that ultimately the Pope will see 
his own best interest and yield his untenable posi- 
tion. The author is distinctly a patriot, and whether 
or not his views are well founded, his patriotism 
and enthusiasm are refreshing, after the recent 
lugubrious prophecies by others of the approaching 
dissolution of Italy. The translation, by Mary 
Alice Vialls, is generally good, though it is mark- 
edly better for the inspiring utterances of great 
leaders like Cavour, or Mazzini (the text abounds 
in quotations) than for the author's own writing. 

Of all the " Heroes of the Nations," 
The story of none is more essentially the centre 

Richelieu. . intuf ..u ^.u 

of romantic possibilities than the 
great Cardinal, Armand du Plesis de Richelieu. 
The average reader of this latter day dramatizes 
him as " under the red robe," drawing round him 
" the magic circle of the Church," holding midnight 
conferences with messengers booted and spurred or 
disguised bravoes in hodden gray : in general, as a 
relentless spider, who " thrilled at each touch and 
lived along the line," and gave his enemies the 
choice between submission and death. All this he 
doubtless was ; but in Mr. James Breck Perkins's 
volume on " Richelieu and the Growth of the French 
Power" (Putnam) the author has pretty thoroughly 
stripped off the draperies, and has sought to tell a 
plain tale plainly the story of the petty provincial 
Bishop of Luon, who pushed and flattered and 
intrigued his way to a place at court; who was 
more of a priest than an author, more of a soldier 
than a priest, and was most of all the statesman 
whose theory of government was absolute monarchy 
with a minister for monarch. Mr. Perkins writes 
of his hero with cool candor ; he has apparently no 
illusions as to any of the amiable virtues being 
included in Richelieu's outfit : and his readers have 
little choice but to accept his summary of the Car- 
dinal's character : " His intellect though acute was 
not original, his character though vigorous was not 
exalted. . . . He was sagacious in his policy, tire- 
less in his activity, and remorseless in his animos- 
ities. . . . Imperious when he held power, he was 
obsequious when he sought it : no one flattered 
the great more adroitly when he was himself a 
person of small account." Mr. Perkins's concluding 
words on the results of Richelieu's policy have a 
certain timeliness to-day: "It is desirable that 
comfort should be generally diffused and that 
wealth should increase, yet the accumulation of 
money is not the sole object of national, any more 
than of individual existence. Richelieu had other 



ideals ; he wished France to be the first state of 
Europe, he desired that her boundaries should grow 
broader, her power grow greater, her influence 
become larger. He wished to shape the form of 
government so that these ends might be attained, 
and he accomplished the object which he undertook. 
It is doubtful whether the French people were any 
happier at the end of Richelieu's administration 
than at its beginning, but beyond question, France 
was a more powerful state." The book has the 
usual attractions and conveniences which we have 
learned to expect in the volumes of this series : 
there are twenty-three portraits from authentic 
sources, maps and plans of France and Paris, 
and a sufficient index. 



A dissection 

of the Hexaleuch. 



The first volume of Mr. W. E. Addis's 
" The Documents of the Hexateuch " 
appeared several years ago, and now 
the second, on "The Deuteronomical Writers and 
the Priestly Documents " (Putnam) presents its re- 
sults. These are the questions asked and answered 
in its nearly 500 pages : (1) What was the kernel 
of the Deuteronomical code as found in Deuteron- 
omy, chapters 12-26? (2) What is the character 
of the historical and introductory chapters (1-11) 
to this code? (3) What chapters were appended to 
the laws in the strict sense of the word, which en- 
force its observation partly by promises and threats, 
and partly explain the way in which it was trans- 
mitted by Moses to the Levites ? (4) What was the 
work done by the Deuteronomic school which edited 
older historical works, and inserted remarks of their 
own in criticism of past history ? The first question 
is answered (p. 18) by, "it is not incredible that a 
dozen hands may have been at work within this 
narrow compass" (chaps. 12-26). The second is 
decided by, " they (chaps. 1-4:40) are a later ad- 
dition by a writer of the Deuteronomic school " 
(p. 20); "chaps. 5-11 must also proceed from dif- 
ferent bands." To the third question we find the 
answer, that Deuteronomy chap. 28 is an authentic 
part of the original book, chap. 27 is transitional 
between 26 and 28, and is composed of old and of 
new material; chaps. 29-30 are by a later writer 
of the Deuteronomic school ; chaps. 31-32 are also 
made* up of material of different dates. Briefly, 
the fourth question is answered by finding traces of 
the Deuteronomic writer in the decalogue, in the 
book of the covenant, in Joshua 1-12, and here 
and there in Judges and Kings. Now, to make all 
of this plain to the reader, the author has presented 
these documents in English translation, and in dif- 
ferent kinds of type to represent the different docu- 
ments, and has arranged them in the proper order, 
under appropriate divisions and subdivisions. Abun- 
dant footnotes are used to give quotations from 
other works, reasons for the position taken, and 
critical remarks on the text. This work displays a 
vast amount of critical genius, and presents the 
vanguard of the extreme radical school of analytical 
criticism of the Hexateuch.

Among the varied schemes conceived 
Famous pets of j humane English men and women 

Oxford University. J ,, ', ,,. t u r J 

for the purpose of swelling the fund 
consecrated to the needs of the wounded soldiers in 
the Boer country, is an ingenious and interesting 
device brought to maturity by members of the 
scholarly circle connected with Oxford University. 
It is the publication of a neat volume comprising 
upward of a score of brief, unpretending sketches of 
"Some Oxford Pets" (Oxford: B. H. Blackwell). 
Each is by a separate hand and commemorates 
feelingly the virtues and manners of individuals of 
the inferior races that have been by chance or choice 
adopted as housemates and familiar friends. Pro- 
fessor and Mrs. Max Miiller tell of the endearing 
traits of a couple of dachshunds that were for years 
valued companions. Mr. W. Warde Fowler writes 
the memoir of Billy, the fox-terrier, who was trained 
to respect the rights of birds as faithfully as did 
his master. Dr. Fairbairn declares his abiding 
affection for two full-blooded terriers who betrayed 
their noble pedigree in their dignified behavior. 
One contributor relates the story of a brown owl 
that, completely domesticated, evinced surprising 
intelligence in a loyal attachment to its owner that 
lasted through a considerable lifetime. Another 
gives an engaging account of a jerboa, that strange 
creature of whom Browning said : 

" There are none such as he for a wonder 
Half bird and half mouse." 

A rat, a mouse, a hen, and a chameleon are among 
the list of humble beings honored with a memorial 
by loving survivors. The sketches possess an in- 
terest apart from the subjects they treat. They 
reveal the gentle side of the writer, and in every 
case win us by the kind and just consideration 
shown to dumb dependents who were thrown upon 
the mercy of their masters, and were never neglected 
nor oppressed. The historettes were compiled by 
Mrs. Wallace and furnished with a preface by Mr. 
W. Warde Fowler, M.A. 



The latest 
in Biology. 



The same high standard of scientific 
excellence found in previous issues 
is to be seen in the "Woods Holl 
Biological Lectures " (Ginn & Co.) for 1899. The 
titles of the sixteen lectures show that the annual 
volume for the past year is somewhat more varied 
than usual in its contents and that it contains a 
large amount that is non-technical for the general 
reader. The lecturers come from the leading uni- 
versities throughout our country and speak upon 
themes which are their specialties. The book thus 
affords first-hand information in condensed and 
usually very readable form upon subjects at present 
prominent in biological discussion. Professor Camp- 
bell writes of the evolution of the higher plants in 
the light of cytology, and Professor Penhallow of 
the evidence which fossil plants reveal of the course 
of evolution of the vegetable world. Professor 
MacDougal reports upon a new field of investiga- 
tion, the effect of ascending and descending cur- 



rents of air upon the distribution of life in moun- 
tain regions. Dr. Thorndike discusses instinct and 
the associative processes in animals with experi- 
mental evidence that controverts some generally 
accepted views. The reactions of minute organisms 
to various forms of stimuli are summarized by Dr. 
Jennings from his recent studies, and an account of 
the blind fishes of North America is given by Pro- 
fessor Eigenmann. Other lectures treat of neglected 
factors in evolution, the growth of color in moths 
and butterflies, the physiology of secretion, and old 
and new interpretations of regeneration. The ap- 
plication of statistical methods to the problem of 
variation and the study of race changes is warmly 
advocated by Professor Davenport. The closing 
chapter is a brief but most interesting account of 
Professor Loeb's startling discovery of the produc- 
tion of artificial parthenogenesis in the eggs of sea- 
urchins by the use of chemical solutions. 



A famous f envy that the 

secondary school American reads Mr. Lionel Cust's 
of England. History of Eton College" (im- 

ported by Scribner), the latest volume of a series 
on English public schools, those ancient founda- 
tions which succeed in giving the governing classes 
of England an education so suitable for their coun- 
try's ambitions. But it is rather because of the 
associations, the " atmosphere," which centuries of 
classical and literary cultivation within its ancient 
walls have created, than for any of those curiously 
barbaric tendencies in the English aristocracy which 
Matthew Arnold deplored, that Americans are en- 
vious. Founded by that most amiable king, Henry 
VI., in 1440, and persevering under conditions prac- 
tically unchanged until 1875, Eton has acquired a 
momentum in the educational world which no sec- 
ondary school in the United States can hope to rival. 
In the growing sense of " shame in dying rich " 
which would be so promising a sign in our national 
life were it less suggestive of mediaeval penitence, 
the secondary schools have been forgotten ; and 
more than one whose brief years were filled with 
hope and promise of almost Etonian usefulness have 
been permitted to languish and die. 



Living as 
an Art. 



In his little volume, " The Arts of 
Life" (Houghton), Mr. R. R. Bowker 
discusses with compelling thought- 
fulness various phases of the conduct of life as a 
well ordered existence informed by culture and 
high ideals. His more important chapters deal with 
education, business, politics, and religion, and in 
the course of them he sets forth with a pleasing lit- 
erary art the attitude towards life and its problems 
of a man of fine culture and clear conception of the 
broader aspects of our relation to environment and 
to ourselves. Mr. Bowker has nothing strikingly 
original to offer in his philosophy of life, but the 
philosophy is so attractive and well rounded out, 
and the presentation of it has so much of the charm 
of meditation and personality, that the reader is

glad to follow it with something more than inter- 
est. Concluding, he says: "The thought of Evolu- 
tion, opposing itself alike to the doctrines of special 
creation in nature, of revolution in society and 
government, and of instant 'conversion' in religion, 
has become the great light upon God's universe, which 
more than any other before given to man, gives 
us knowledge even of the uses of evil and the great 
hope of the triumphing of good. In this thought, 
to each of the sons and daughters of men is com- 
mitted the destiny of Man. This is the End of 
the Arts of Life." In an age so full of feverish 
eagerness to drink the wine of life to the lees and 
wait not we may well be grateful for every such 
calm survey of the larger possibilities of existence 
and its finer aspirations, and no one can read Mr. 
Bowker's volume without feeling that the atmos- 
phere of his work-a-day world has been cleared 
somewhat by the breath of some diviner air blown 
upon him from the heights. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The school text-books of to-day are so immeasurably 
better than those of fifteen or twenty years ago that 
there are few departments in which anything is left to 
be desired. But the ideal book of English history for 
school use has been long delayed, and we welcome Mr. 
J. N. Larned's "History of England" (Houghton) as 
at least a close approach to that ideal. We have never 
seen a better book upon the subject, and should find it 
difficult to suggest wherein the present work might be 
improved. In style, in choice of illustration, in topical 
analysis, and in helpful material for the use of teachers, 
it is a thoroughly admirable production, and should at 
once find its way into secondary schools everywhere. 

The cosmopolitan scholarship of Signer Federica 
Garlanda, the editor of the Italian " Minerva," is at- 
tested by a number of publications in philology, political 
science, and literary criticism. His latest work (Rome: 
Laziale) is entitled " Guglielmo Shakespeare, il Poeta 
e l'Uomo." It is a careful study of the life and times 
of Shakespeare, with a readable account of the most 
important of the plays, particular attention being given 
to those having Italian subjects. It is full of reverence 
for the genius of the poet, and exhibits an appreciation 
of his qualities somewhat deeper and more subtle than 
we expect from a critic of the Latin race. 

Mr. David McKay is the publisher of a new edition 
of an important practical manual by Mr. Oliver Davie. 
It is entitled " Methods in the Art of Taxidermy," 
and gives complete expert directions for every process 
connected with the preparation and stuffing of the 
skins of animals, including birds, mammals, crustace- 
ans, fishes, and reptiles. The author was engaged 
upon this work for many years, and it has the benefit 
of his life-long experience. The illustrations consist 
of nearly a hundred full-page engravings. 

The Messrs. Scribner have revamped the translation, 
made more than twenty years ago, of Gaboriau's most 
popular novels, and the result is a uniform set of six 
presentable volumes. The set includes " Monsieur 
Lecoq " and its sequel or supplement, " The Honor of 
the Name," "File 113," "The Widow Lerouge," " Other 
People's Money," and " The Mystery of Orcival." 



NOTES. 

"Poems from Shelley and Keats," edited by Mr. 
Sidney C. Newson, is a school text recently published 
by the Macmillan Co. 

The American Jewish Year Book for 5661 (1900- 
1901), edited by Dr. Cyrus Adler, will be issued at 
once by the Jewish Publication Society of America. 

Dr. F. D. Allen's edition of the " Medea " of Eurip- 
ides, revised by Dr. Clifford H. Moore, is among the 
latest educational publications of Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Alice B. Stockham & Co. are the publishers of a 
small book on "Tolstoy," in two parts, the first of 
which is the work of Miss Alice B. Stockham, and the 
second the work of Mr. Havelock Ellis. 

" Bibliomania in the Middle Ages," by F. Somner 
Merry weather, is the subject of the next volume to 
appear in the series of book-lovers' classics published by 
Messrs. Meyer Brothers & Co., of New York. 

Beginning with the September number, " Art Educa- 
tion " appears in an enlarged and improved form, and 
hereafter will make its appeal to all who are interested 
in art matters, whether teachers of the subject or not. 

Mr. Richard Watson Gilder has reissued his " Five 
Books of Song," being his complete poetical writings, 
in an edition which embodies numerous revisions and 
additions to the earlier text. The Century Co. publish 
the volume. 

A single volume contains Parts III. and IV. of the 
" Handbook to Christian and Ecclesiastical Rome," 
which has been prepared by Messrs. M. A. R. Tucker 
and Hope Malleson. The work is published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

" Whence and Whither," by Dr. Paul Carus, is a 
volume of popular philosophy, being " an inquiry into 
the nature of the soul, its origin, and its destiny." It 
is issued by the Open Court Co. in their " Religion of 
Science Library." 

" Places I Have Visited," published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co., is one of Lamb's biblia a-biblia. It is a 
blank book, in which a traveler may record his im- 
pressions, and set forth the circumstances of his visit 
to any particular place. 

White's " Selborne " and the ever-delightful " Travels 
of Sir John Mandeville " are given us as the two latest 
volumes in the " Library of English Classics " published 
by the Macmillan Co. Mr. A. W. Pollard is, as here- 
tofore with this series, the editor. 

The Macmillan Co. send us Volume III. of Mr. Evelyn 
Shuckburgh's translation of " The Letters of Cicero." 
One more volume will complete this undertaking, and 
provide us with the entire extant correspondence of the 
great Roman statesman and man of letters. 

The seventh and concluding volume of Professor 
Bury's edition of Gibbon's " Decline and Fall " has just 
been published by the Messrs. Macmillan. An index 
of nearly two hundred pages, prepared by Mrs. Bury, 
appears with this volume, and immeasurably enhances 
the value of the edition. 

One of the latest we do not venture to say the 
latest translators of Omar is Professor F. York 
Powell, who has tried his hand at a few of the Rubai- 
yat. His " XXIV. Quatrains from Omar," as pub- 
lished by Mr. M. F. Mansfield, makes a very pretty 
little book, but the verse is tame at the best, and we 
cannot understand what could have persuaded any one 
to compose or to publish it.

THE DIAL

Part III. of Mr. Evelyn Abbott's "History of 
Greece," now published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons, extends from 445 to 403 B. C.; in other words, 
from the Thirty Years' Peace to the Fall of the Thirty 
at Athens. It includes some reprinted matter from 
the author's " Perides." One more volume will com- 
plete the work. 

The late Hugh McCulloch's " Men and Measures of 
Half a Century," which has now for some time been 
out of print, is reproduced in a new and cheaper edition 
by the Messrs. Scribner. It is well that this should 
have been done, for the work is one of the most impor- 
tant memoirs of its period, and is much in demand by 
students of American history. 

" Ned Myers ; or, Life before the Mast," has been 
added by the Messrs. Putnam to their "Mohawk" edi- 
tion of Cooper's novels. This book, it will be remem- 
bered, is the one recently discovered, and thought at 
first to have remained unpublished, although it was 
afterwards proved to have seen the light. It now takes 
its long vacant place in the library sets of Cooper. 

Messrs. Newson & Co., New York, are the publish- 
ers of " A Modern English Grammar," by Mr. Huber 
Gray Buehler. It seems to be a sensible sort of book, 
free from scholastic rubbish, and thoroughly practical 
in method. It is evidently the work of an experienced 
and successful teacher of the subject. It also speaks 
well for the new publishing house of which it consti- 
tutes the first venture. 

Dr. Raymond M. Alden is the author of a treatise on 
"The Art of Debate" (Holt), which will be found 
highly useful by students who are training for forensic 
honors. The discussion is lucid, and the illustrative 
material adduced is of the most helpful sort. Nor 
should we neglect to mention the appended list of sub- 
jects for debate, which will doubtless help many a com- 
mittee of students to solve the vexatious initial problem 
of deciding upon the question to be debated. 

The news of the death of Thomas Davidson, which 
occurred on the 14th of September, will cause wide- 
spread grief, not only in educational and philosophical 
circles, but wherever his influence was felt, which 
means among great numbers of men and women to 
whom the intellectual life is not so much a professional 
matter as the highest of general human concerns. To 
many such people, his writings and his lectures came 
as a quickening influence and a vital inspiration, en- 
forced by a large and sympathetic personality. His 
books were the least importaut of his points of contact 
with his fellow-men, and his life was an even finer 
thing than his published work. Born a Scotsman in 
1840, his footsteps sought one centre of learning after 
another in England and on the Continent, and for his 
last score or so of years he was a resident of this 
country. His chief studies were in Greek and scholastic 
philosophy, in the theory of education, in the fine arts, 
and in the higher reaches of literature. He was the 
interpreter of such men as Aquinas, Bonaventura, 
Dante, and Rosmini. He was a vigorous philosophical 
thinker, with a touch of mysticism, seeming at times 
a radical, and at others a reactionary. His summer 
school of philosophy in the Adirondacks attracted an- 
nually a notable company of serious men and women, 
and exercised a considerable influence over contem- 
porary thought. The fine old ideal of plain living and 
high thinking was never better exemplified than in the 
person of this robust and genial scholar, whose loss we 
now chronicle with unfeigned regret.

BOWER'S JOHN THISSELTON. , 2 mo. $1.50. 

A novel of to-day, laid in England and on the Continent, by Miss MARION BOWER, author of "The Story of Mollie." Those of its scenes 
which are tragic are said to be relieved by a certain humorous irony, and its numerous incidents many of them decidedly dramatic to lead 
rapidly to an unexpected ending. 

DUDENEY'S MEN OF MARLOWE'S. I2 mo. $7.25. 

Inter-related tales of denizens of an English "Inn" like those of the Temple. They are said to show a distinct advance in the author's 
work and considerable humor. 

From an advance note in the Bookman : " Marked by a fine vigor and imagination . . . they rather remind one of some of th* 
shorter tales of J. M. Barrie. . . . That masculine touch which has been praised so highly in her earlier work characterizes and dominates 
very strongly these stories." 

)d Impression of DUDENEY'S FOLLY CORNER. I2 mo. $7.25. 

Bookman : "A work of art permeated icith an extraordinarily sympathetic understanding of the human heart." 

N. Y. Herald: "Her novel is so striking, so unusual, and yet so valuable, that it fascinates and holds your attention through the swift 
succession of events."

New conditions create new problems, new necessities, new duties, new opportunities. The question of 
expansion is discussed in the light of these new conditions, and Dr. Strong has the rare quality of making figures 
and statistics not only attractive, but fascinating, as is evidenced by the sale of several hundred thousands of 
his other books.

COMPILED BY ARTHUR T. VANCE, EDITOR OF "THE HOME MAGAZINE." 
12mo, Cloth, Illustrated, 75 Cents. 

An interesting volume, about the personality of the late David Hannum, who was the original of the world- 
famous novel, and in life as interesting a character as Mr. Westcott made him in fiction. 

The contents include an account of a visit of the compiler to Homer, New York, which every reader of the 
popular novel will recognize as the " Homeville " of the story ; an unpublished chapter from the Novel ; together 
with many anecdotes about the late David Hannum and his career and achievements after Mr. Westcott left him. 

The volume is illustrated with many portraits and other photographs.

BARRIE'S MASTERPIECE. 

" TOMMY AND QRIZEL - 

By JAMES M. BARRIE, author of " Sentimental Tommy," etc. 

Mr. Barrie's new novel has been accepted everywhere as the most important hook which he 

has yet written a character study of remarkable originality, presented with power, humor, and 

pathos. The Chicago Advance says : " Barrie has created a character absolutely unique and of 

striking individuality. There is no other such instance of vivid and subtle character-study in 

recent fiction." 

Illustrated by Bernard Partridge. 12mo, $1.50. 

THE OLD GENTLEMAN OF THE BLACK STOCK 

By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. With 8 full-page illustrations in colors by Howard Chandler Christy. 

ISmo, $1.50. 

A story that in this attractive holiday form will appeal to all lovers of " Marse Chan " and " Meh 
Lady " by reason of the tenderness of feeling and beauty of sentiment with which the portraits are drawn. 
The format and the illustrations in color bracket the book with the very successful " Santa Claus's Partner " 
of last season, now in its 30th thousand. 

BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE SHIP OF STARS." 

OLD FIRES AND PROFITABLE GHOSTS 

By A. T. QUILLER-COUCH ( Q "). The fifteen stories in " Q's " new book are of revenants persons 
who either in spirit or in body revisit old scenes, return upon old selves or old emotions, or relate a 
message from a world beyond perception. They range over a wide variety of scene and incident, and 
are told with admirable art. ISmo, $1.50. 

DOMESTIC DRAMAS By PAUL BOURGET 

Translated by WILLIAM MARCH ANT. 12mo, $1.50. 

M. BOURGET'S latest volume may be said to have been written for the English-speaking, quite as 
much as for the Parisian, world. It is composed of a group of stories of home life whose unity is indicated 
by the title. 

THE GIRL AND THE GUARDSMAN 

By ALEXANDER BLACK. With 20 full-page illustrations, decorative designs, etc. 12mo, $1.50. 
Unlike the author's last two volumes of amusing studies of social types, Mr. Black's new book is a 
novel, with a strongly marked dramatic quality. The plot deals with love and war, the hero being a 
national guardsman who volunteers for service in the Philippines. The complications which follow the 
report of his death involve the girl to whom he was engaged and his intimate friend, and are set forth 
with vivacity and interest.

[Oct. 16, 



A CENTURY OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY 

Being a Brief Review of the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1776-1876. By JOHN 
W. FOSTER, former Secretary of State for the United States. 8vo, $3.50. 
Mr. Foster is exceptionally qualified to write a diplomatic history of the United States. He has been longer 
jn the American diplomatic service than any other man except John Quincy Adams. He has served as United 
States Minister in Mexico, Russia, and Spain ; has been special Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, Germany, San 
Domingo, China, and Japan ; and has been a member of the most important high commissions sitting in this 
country for many years. His book is one of great value, is enlivened by many personal sketches, and is written 
in a popular style. 



THE LAST REFUGE 

A Sicilian Romance. By HENRY B. FULLER, author 
of "From the Other Side," "The Chevalier of 
Pensieri-Vani," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 
The hero, finding his zest in life diminishing, seeks to 
regain it by visiting Rome, seeing its splendors, mingling in 
its social pleasures ; he goes to country games, and beauti- 
ful scenes, but none of these satisfy him. He learns of a 
city where there is great need and opnortunity for service. 
In this he discovers Duty and finds a Refuge. The story is 
told with great charm of style, and promises to be one of the 
more notable novels of the season. 

A WHITE GUARD TO SATAN 

By Miss A. M. EWELL. 16mo, $1.25. 
An interesting historical novel relating to Bacon's Rebel- 
lion in Virginia in 1676, an episode that offers a subject for 
a very spirited story. The incident which gives the title was 
highly dramatic, placing the wives and children of the attack- 
ing force in front, thus making them, as one of the leaders 
said, "a guard to Satan." 

RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIANS 

By EDMUND NOBLE, author of " The Russian Revolt." 

12mo, $1.50. 

A concise but comprehensive work, bringing into promi- 
nence the course and controlling processes of Russian develop- 
ment, and presenting in clear style the story of Russia and 
the Russian people. The important episodes of Russian his- 
tory are emphasized, and the book represents the deep inter- 
est which Americans take in the future of Russia. 

SQUIRRELS AND OTHER 
FUR-BEARERS 

By John BURROUGHS. With 15 illustrations in colors 
after Audubon, and a frontispiece from life. Square 
12mo, $1.00. 

A charming book on squirrels, the chipmunk, woodchuck, 
rabbit, mnskrat, skunk, fox, weasel, mink, raccoon, porcu- 
pine, possum, and wild mice. Mr. Burronghs's observations 
on these are exceedingly interesting, and the reproductions 
of some of Audubon's colored plates add much to the value 
and attractiveness of the book. 

THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF 
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING 

Cambridge Edition. Edited by HARRIET WATERS 
PRESTON. With a Biographical Sketch, Notes, In- 
dexes to Titles and First Lines, a Portrait of Mrs. 
Browning, and an engraved title-page with a Vig- 
nette. Large crown 8vo, gilt top, $2.00. 



THE HOUSE BEHIND THE 
CEDARS 

By CHARLES W. CHESNUTT, author of " The Conjure 
Woman," and " The Wife of His Youth." Crown 
8vo, $1.50. 

Like Mr. Chesnutt's previous books, this novel is a story 
of the "Color Line," snowing how difficult if not impos- 
sible it is to hide, or escape the heavy penalty of, even the 
slightest heritage of negro blood. It involves romance, very 
dramatic incidents and revelations of character, and while 
its literary charm will attract readers, the deep significance 
and tragedy of the story will stir a feeling far profounder 
than mere interest. 

THE PRODIGAL 

By MARY HALLOCK FOOTE, author of " Cceur d'Alene," 
"The Led-Horse Claim," etc. Illustrated by the 
author. 12mo, $1.25. 

The " Prodigal" is a spendthrift young Ancklander who 
drifts to San Francisco, and hunts up his wealthy father's 
agents. They give him a very meagre allowance and compel 
him to call daily for it. He does not enjoy his discipline, 
but meets a school-teacher who is a very nice girl, and the 
future clears soon and permanently. 

THROUGH OLD-ROSE GLASSES 

By MARY TRACY EARLE. 12mo, $1.50. 
Eight stories, mainly Southern in scenes and characters, 
several of them having a slight connecting thread of locality 
and persons. The stories have humor, freshness, and a style 
which lends to them a distinct charm and ought to make the 
book very popular. 

THE BOOK OF SAINTS AND 
FRIENDLY BEASTS 

BY ABBIE FARWELL BROWN. Illustrated. Square 

12mo, $1.25. 

A book of attractive stories and ballads of saints who 
have had beasts and birds for attendants or helpers. Ten 
Saints are embraced in the book, with their good animal 
friends the lion, wolf, gulls, cow, goose, robin, camels, fish, 
and others. The book is capitally written for children, and 
has several good pictures. 

NEW CABINET EDITIONS 

Of the Complete Poetical Works of ROBERT BURKS,

BY HENRY ILIOWIZI, AUTHOR OF "!N THE PALE," ETC. 

Illustrated by a photogravure and half-tones from drawings by W. SHERMAN POTTS (Paris). 
Cloth, gilt top, list price, $1.50. 

These are Eastern Tales, gathered by the author during a lengthy residence in the 
Orient, and contain some new and striking legends that have never before found their way 
into print. Among them is a curious and very ancient version of the legend of the Wan- 
dering Jew, from Arabic sources, that will be entirely new to the reader, although some 
slight allusions to it are to be found in the Koran.

FAITHS OF FAMOUS MEN 

By JOHN KEN YON KILBOURN, D.D. 

Large crown 8vo, cloth, gilt top, list price $2.00 

This important work comprises, in their own words, the religions views of the most distinguished 
scientists, statesmen, philosophers, rulers, authors, generals, business men, liberal thinkers, leaders of re- 
ligious denominations, etc., etc. These have been taken from published works, from letters, and in some 
few instances as with Ex- President Cleveland, who personally wrote what he wished included ; or the 
Rev. Dr. Storrs, who, before his death, selected what he wished to represent him the selections have 
been made by the writers themselves. 



From IAN MACLARKN (John Watson, D.D.), author of 
" Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush," etc. 
DEAR DR. KILBOURN : The idea of your book seems 
to me excellent, and I wish it all success.

A CENTURY OF AMERICAN VERSE. 

Among the publications of the present year, 
including those that have already seen the light 
and those promised for the near future, there 
is none of greater importance or more perma- 
nent value to the readers of this country than 
the " American Anthology " with which Mr. 
Stedman has crowned his quarter-century's 
work for the appreciation and illustration of 
the English poetry of our modern age. In the 
performance of that work, criticism and selec- 
tion have gone hand in hand, and the insight 
which has produced the best systematic valua- 
tions of our nineteenth century verse has also 
provided us with what are incomparably the 
best treasuries into which the finer efflorescence 
of that verse have been collected. We owe 



Mr. Stedman a debt of deep gratitude for his 
loyal devotion to the interests of the poetry of 
our own time, and for the painstaking industry 
which, having previously supplemented the 
" Victorian Poets " with a " Victorian An- 
thology," has in like fashion supplemented the 
" Poets of America " with the " American An- 
thology " which is now, after much vexatious 
delay, placed in our hands. 

In this portly volume of close upon a thou- 
sand pages we have a representation of the 
poetical activity of the national period of our 
history, beginning with the lyrics of Freneau, 
and ending with the work of certain of our 
younger men graduates of the last few years 

for whom a single line constitutes the ap- 
pended biographical note. By actual count, 
the number of writers whose work receives 
illustration is five hundred and seventy-one, of 
all degrees of majority and minority. No an- 
thologist can hope to satisfy all of his critics, 
and in the present case some fifty or a hun- 
dred additional names might easily be sug- 
gested by others than those who bear them 

as worthy of inclusion ; but this easy sort 
of fault-finding is no part of our purpose, and 
we are quite sure that no other hand could 
have performed Mr. Stedman's task with equal 
skill, sympathy, and nice discernment, that no 
other mind could have been found so richly 
stored with the knowledge of the subject 
requisite for the making of such a collection. 
If some small proportion of the contents seem 
undeserving of the distinction here conferred 
we shall do well to take heed of the editorial 
hint that "humble bits, low in color, have 
values of juxtaposition, and often bring out to 
full advantage his more striking material." 
And the editor forestalls critics of the carping 
type by himself quoting Nathaniel Ward's 
couplet which might else be quoted against 
him to the effect that 

" Poetry 's a gift wherein but few excel, 
He doth very ill that doth not passing well." 

After much hesitation and tentative experi- 
ment, Mr. Stedman determined upon a chrono- 
logical rather than a classified arrangement 
for the present volume. The Victorian poets 
" crystallize into groups, each animated by a 
master, or made distinct by the fraternization 
of poets with tastes in common." The poets 
of America, on the other hand, do not lend

themselves to such a system of grouping, ex- 
cept in a few cases. There is, no doubt, a cer- 
tain unity in the methods and the endeavor of 
the academic group that we associate with the 
Cambridge and Concord and Boston of a gen- 
eration ago, and something of the same sort 
may be claimed for the poets of the journalistic 
and semi-Bohemian group that we associate 
with the New York of the corresponding period. 
But in the main, our poets have been charac- 
terized by individualism, by results that must 
doubtless be described as derivative, but that 
derive from the general English tradition rather 
than from any strongly-marked interactions and 
obligations to special leadership. The only 
satisfactory order of arrangement thus appeared 
to be that of sequence in time. 

Mr. Steel man finds it convenient to divide 
our first poetical century into eight sections. 
The first of them has something of the char- 
acter of a prologue, and includes such names 
as Freneau, Paulding, Allston, Wilde, and 
Dana. Then follow three divisions, of about 
fifteen years each, constituting what is called 
the " First Lyrical Period." In the first of 
these divisions we find Halleck, Drake, Bryant, 
Sprague, Percival, and Pinckney. In the sec- 
ond we find Emerson, Willis, Hoffman, Long- 
fellow, Whittier, Poe, and Holmes. In the 
third we find Lowell, Whitman, Parsons, 
Boker, Taylor, and Stoddard. Then follows 
the " Second Lyrical Period," also in three 
divisions, each of about ten years. In the first 
we find Dr. Mitchell, Hayne, Mrs. Jackson, Mr. 
Stedman, Mr. and Mrs. Piatt, Mrs. Moulton, 
Mr. Winter, Mr. Aldrich, Mr. Harte, Sill, Mr. 
Miller, and Lanier. In the second we find Mr. 
Gilder, Miss Thomas, Miss Lazarus, Mr. Van 
Dyke, and Mr. R. U. Johnson. In the third we 
find Mr. Wood berry, Bunner, Mrs. Deland, 
Miss Cone, and Miss Guiney. Finally, we have 
a section that forms a sort of epilogue, and in- 
cludes many names of our most recent writers, 
among them being Mr. Robert Cameron Rog- 
ers, Miss Sophie Jewett, Richard Hovey, Mr. 
Cawein, Miss Aldrich, Mr. E. A. Robinson, 
Miss Josephine Peabody, and Miss Helen Hay. 

It is evident enough that the poetical show- 
ing of our first century has little significance 
from the cosmopolitan point of view, although, 
as we shall urge a little further on, it has much 
significance for us as a nation. Let us see how 
it compares with the showing of the mother- 
country. The twelve greatest English poets 
of the same period are Keats, Shelley, Byron, 
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Landor, Tennyson, 



Browning, Arnold, Rossetti, Morris, and Mr. 
Swinburne. The best dozen of our American 
poets are probably Bryant, Emerson, Holmes, 
Longfellow, Lowell, Poe, Whitman, Whittier, 
Lanier, Taylor, Mr. Aldrich, and Mr. Sted- 
man. There is obviously little room for com- 
parison between the two groups. From the 
standpoint of disinterested criticism it is hardly 
too much to say that in absolute value every 
one of the English group outweighs the best 
of the Americans. It would require an excess 
of patriotic zeal to dispute a conclusion so 
obvious to the impartial observer. But with- 
out blinking this fact, we have no need to hide 
our diminished heads, for the poets of America 
have done for us a work which the poets of 
the mother-country, Shakespeare and all, could 
not have done for us : they have kept the 
torch of our national idealism aflame, and have 
touched our national spirit to issues as fine as 
any that have engaged the consciousness of the 
peoples of the Old World. To do these things 
is the true service of poetry, and, knowing how 
well our own poets have done them for us, we 
may take a just pride in their achievements, 
caring little for comparisons which, in a case 
like this, must be peculiarly invidious. 

When Mr. Stedman reached the conclusion 
" that if a native anthology must yield to the 
foreign one in wealth of choice production, it 
might prove to be, from an equally vital point 
of view, the more significant of the two," he 
occupied ground that was less paradoxical 
than it seemed. The significance of a corpus 
of national song rests not so much upon its 
absolute artistic value as upon its power to 
mould the ideals of a people by giving expres- 
sion to those higher instincts that are always 
groping toward the light, but that may fail of 
their purpose when the light is obscured. 
This Republic was founded upon an idealism 
finer than any hitherto known in the modern 
world, and it is to our poets, far more than to 
our so-called practical men, that we owe the 
perpetuation of that idealism in our hearts. 
It is their teaching that has inspired us to 
hope in our darkest hour; it is a belief in the 
potency of their messages that still rebukes 
our wavering faith in so momentous a crisis 
of our national life as that which we confront 
in this closing year of the century. 

We may well ask, with the editor of the 
present collection, what constitutes the real 
significance of the poetry of any nation. Is it 
" the essential quality of its material as poetry," 
or is it " its quality as an expression and in- 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



259 



terpretation of the time itself " ? Mr. Stedman 
declares for the latter of these alternatives, 
and urges that view with much logical force. 
" Our own poetry excels as a recognizable voice in 
utterance of the emotions of a people. The storm and 
stress of youth have been upon us, and the nation has 
not lacked its lyric cry; meanwhile the typical senti- 
ments of piety, domesticity, freedom, have made our 
less impassioned verse at least sincere. One who un- 
derrates the significance of our literature, prose or 
verse, as both the expression and the stimulant of 
national feeling, as of import in the past and to the 
future of America, and therefore of the world, is de- 
ficient in that critical insight which can judge even of 
its own day unwarped by personal taste or deference 
to public impression. He shuts his eyes to the fact 
that at times, notably throughout the years resulting 
in the Civil War, this literature has been a ' force.' Its 
verse until the dominance of prose fiction well into 
the seventies, let us say formed the staple of current 
reading ; and fortunate it was while pirated foreign 
writings, sold cheaply everywhere, handicapped the 
evolution of a native prose school that the books of the 
' elder American poets ' lay on the centre-tables of our 
households, and were read with zest by young and old." 

If our poets have not been great poets in 
the world- sense, they have accomplished great 
things for our spiritual life, and our feeling 
toward them is of gratitude and reverence 
commingled. They have twined themselves 
about our affections as no others could have 
done, and have become associated with our 
fondest recollections and our deepest aspira- 
tions. And our love is bestowed not only upon 
our Whittier and our Holmes, our Emerson 
and our Lowell, but also upon those of our 
lesser singers who have touched some intimate 
chord of our consciousness and awakened the 
responsive thrill. Here in this volume are five 
or six hundred names, and who shall assert that 
the least of those who bear them has not contrib- 
uted something of value to the general store, has 
not proved himself worthy of his race and help- 
ful of its spiritual advancement ? What their 
collective endeavor has meant to us as a nation 
is beyond the power of words to testify. But 
it is at least suggested by the felicitous lines in 
which Mr. Stedman himself describes his vision 
of " the constellated matin choir " that " sang 
together in the dawn," and tells us how he 

" Heard their stately hymning, saw their light 
Resolve in flame that evil long inwrought 
With what was else the goodliest domain 
Of freedom warded by the ancient sea." 

Those to whom the sweep of that vision has 
been revealed can have no misgivings concern- 
ing the true worth of American poetry, for 
their feelings are merged in the one emotion 
of swelling pride at thought of their share in 
so noble a national inheritance.

MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN HISTORIAN.* 

Reckoning vividness of portraiture to be the 
right aim of biography, we must consider Mr. 
Farnham's life of Francis Parkman a wholly 
admirable book. We have not for some time 
had the pleasure of examining a work of its 
class which so honestly and interestingly re- 
deems the promise of its title. Not for one 
moment throughout his 360 or so pages does 
the author, so far as we can detect, lose sight 
of the real business in hand, and go straying 
off, after the manner of so many biographers, 
into some lane or blind alley of extraneous 
disquisition, astride of a hobby of his own, and 
quite forgetful of Goethe's admirable saying 
about holding fast to one's subject. 

At the outset of his task, Mr. Farnham 
found himself confronted by a sort of moral 
dilemma arising out of his respect for Park- 
man's extreme reserve and his own conviction 
that such reserve must be ignored by the biog- 
rapher. It is not unlikely that Parkman him- 
self would have preferred that no life of him 
at all should be written. He liked retirement, 
and scorned display. He had, to put it mildly, 
no great respect for that section of the public 
which rejoices in the title of the " plain people," 
and which has fallen heir to the flattery that 
place-hunting politicians used to bestow upon 
kings and courtiers. He strongly denied that 
the public has a right to pry into the private 
life of a man because he is an artist ; and in 
so far as such prying is prompted by vulgar 
curiosity, or the hope of finding something 
toothsome in the way of scandal or " unforeseen 
revelations," all should agree with him. But, 
on the other hand, we agree with Mr. Farnham 
that the public has great concern with and 
even a certain right of expediency to pry into 
such facts in the life of an artist and such ele- 
ments in his personal character and conduct as 
may lead to a better understanding of his 
works. The matter also, as well as the style, 
is in some degree the man. It reflects the pur- 
suits to which, on the whole, his tastes have 
directed him ; it is tinged by the prejudices 
born of his experiences and condition in life. 
There are few obscurities of allusion or pecu- 
liarities (let us add perversities) of view in the 
printed book that may not be explained by the

knowledge of some incident or emergency in 
the life of the writer. Most of us would prob- 
ably be shocked to find how little pure reason 
has helped us to what we call our convictions. 
Parkman, no more than any other author, could 
elude the personal equation in his writings ; 
and as he was a perfectly frank man, and in 
general one with a rather unusually strong 
conviction that his own ways and views were 
the right ones, that equation must in his case, 
save where his treatment is purely pictorial and 
objective, as it often is, be carefully reckoned 
with. His personality is stamped, clear-cut and 
impressive, on his work ; and thus, while there 
is much in the work that portrays and defines 
the man, the work may be far more justly un- 
derstood and keenly enjoyed through such 
information as it is the biographer's province 
to give. 

In figuring Parkman, people are apt to think 
of him as having something peculiarly and 
essentially American in his make-up. The no- 
tion, no doubt, arises from associating him with 
the themes he elected to treat in his histories, 
and the enthusiasm he showed for them ; and 
it is largely true. But he was far from sharing 
some of the beliefs and convictions which go to 
the root of what is commonly called " Ameri- 
canism." He was a contemptuous disbeliever, 
for instance, in the democratic principle of 
equality. He wrote of it : 

" Vaguely and half unconsciously, but every day more 
and more, the masses hug the flattering illusion that 
one man is essentially about as good as another. They 
will not deny that there is a great difference in the 
quality of horses or dogs, but they refuse to see it in 
their own genus. . . . And yet the essential difference 
between man and man is incomparably greater than 
that between horse and horse, or dog and dog. . . . 
The history of the progress of mankind is the history 
of its leading minds. The masses, left to themselves, 
are hardly capable of progress, except material progress, 
and even that imperfectly." 

It must not be imagined that with Parkman 
the upper classes meant in any sense the mon- 
eyed classes. The vulgar rich man he disliked 
and distrusted quite as much as he did the 
ignorant and turbulent poor man. 

" Two enemies, unknown before, have risen like 
spirits of darkness on our social and political horizon 
an ignorant proletariat and a half-taught plutocracy. 
Between lie the classes, happily still numerous and 
strong, in whom rests our salvation." 

But that salvation, Parkman held, and the sal- 
vation of every democracy, must come from 
good leadership from the recognition by the 
people of the superiority, and the consequent 
right to guide and govern, of the real elite of 



the nation, of the men of worth and cultivation 
who could direct the masses with wisdom, foil 
with their aid the demagogue and the selfish 
capitalist, and set the national ideal above the 
level of material interests. His creed was short 
and simple. 

" My political faith lies between two vicious ex- 
tremes, democracy and absolute authority, each of which 
I detest the more because it tends to reach into the 
other. I do not object to a good constitutional mon- 
archy, but prefer a conservative republic, where intelli- 
gence and character, and not numbers, hold the reins 
of power." 

Patriots were the historical figures whom 
Parkman most admired ; and his hero was 
Washington. Second to Washington in his 
esteem came Hamilton. For Franklin, with 
his " Poor Richard " philosophy, he had scant 
regard. Jefferson he disliked exceedingly for 
his sentimental Rousseauism and his flattery 
of the mob. Lincoln's great qualities and high 
services he somewhat grudgingly admitted ; 
but he thought him generally overrated, and, 
on the whole, " a man whose undeniable worth 
and usefulness were due to circumstances more 
than to inherent ability." To ascribe a man's 
greatness to circumstances seems to us in gen- 
eral a cheap, not to say a doubtful, explanation 
of it. That Lincoln was not crushed rather 
than made or, as we should prefer to say, 
revealed by those same " circumstances," 
may seem to most of us the most remarkable 
thing about him. 

Parkman appears to have been a good hater. 
He disliked ministers, although he came him- 
self of a long line of them ; and he once ex- 
pressed in writing the hope that a boy who had 
been named after him would "be brought up 
to some respectable calling and not allowed to 
become a minister." Theologians he roundly 
denounced as "vermin," describing them gen- 
erally as " vague, gushing, soft, spoilt by 
women's attentions, sentimental, unenergetic, 
and insincere in their professions of faith." 
There may have been a vein of jocose exagger- 
ation in all this ; but there was certainly none 
in his denunciations of the selfish politician. 
Statesmanship he honored as the highest of 
callings ; but no words could express his scorn 
and distrust of the " political reptile " whose 
" statesmanship " is that of Mr. Platt and 
whose political end is that of Mr. Croker. 
The spectacle of a great community theoreti- 
cally free yet bound and gagged by the ma- 
chine, and periodically led to the polls like 
lambs to the slaughter, to choose between in- 
competence and rascality on one side, and 



1900.J 



THE DIAL 



261 



rascality and incompetence on the other, roused 
him to fury. 

" Never, since history recorded the life of nations, 
was such a people so led, or rather entangled in such a 
political mesh-work. We make no allusion to this party 
or that. ... As freemen and sovereigns we go to the 
polls and cast our votes, not after our own judgment, 
but at the dictation of self-constituted knots and com- 
binations of men whom we can neither esteem nor trust. 
... A many-headed despotism is exercised in the name 
of the largest liberty. ... If to degrade public morals, 
sink the national reputation, weaken the national coun- 
cils, rout out the race of statesmen, and place pliant 
incompetency in control of our destiny, if these are 
the ends of government, then is our political manage- 
ment a master-piece of wit." 

Turning to the spectacle of the Civil War, 
Parkman saw, in the great popular uprising, 
the nation for once snapping like threads the 
fiimsy shackles with which it had tamely sub- 
mitted to be bound, resuming the control of its 
destinies, and revealing democracy in its grand- 
est aspect. Then, he adds : 

" The political reptiles hid away, or pretended to 
change their nature, and for a time the malarious air 
was purged as by a thunder-storm. Peace brought a 
change. . . . The lion had had his turn, and now the 
fox, the jackal, and the wolf took theirs. Every sly 
political trickster, whom the storm had awed into ob- 
scurity, now found his opportunity. The reptiles crawled 
out again, multiplied, infested caucuses, conventions, 
and Congress. But the people was the saddest spec- 
tacle; the same people that had shown itself so heroic 
in the hour of military trial, were now perplexed, be- 
wildered, tossed between sense and folly, right and 
wrong, taking advice of mountebanks, and swallowing 
their filthy nostrums. The head of Demos was as giddy 
as his heart had been strong." 

Popular education, as conducted in this 
country, Parkman did not believe to be an 
unmixed good. 

"It has produced an immense number of readers; 
but what thinkers are to be found may be said to exist 
in spite of it. The public school has put money in 
abundance in the pockets of the dealers in sensation 
stories, sensation newspapers, and all the swarm of 
trivial, sickly, and rascally literature. ... In our lit- 
erary markets, educated tastes are completely outrid- 
den by uneducated or half-educated tastes, and the 
commodity is debased accordingly. Thus, the editor 
of a magazine may be a man of taste and talents; but 
his interests as a man of letters and his interests as a 
man of business are not the same. ' Why don't you 
make your magazine what it ought to be ? ' we once 
asked a well-known editor. ' Because,' he replied ' if 
we did we should lose four-fifths of our circulation.' " 

Parkman's interest in the public schools was 
intense, and it was largely to the possibility of 
making them builders of character, instead of 
mere agents for brain-cramming, that he looked 
for the safety of democracy for the develop- 
ment of those qualities in the masses which 
should enable them to distinguish good leader- 



ship from bad, and deliver them from the rule 
of the " boss " and the wiles of the demagogue. 
Yet he did not see much hope for the schools 
so long as they too are within reach of the low 
politician. 

" They demand the best intelligence and the best 
conscience of the community; and yet their control rests, 
in the last resort, with legislatures and municipal bodies 
representing in part that very public which needs edu- 
cation the most wretched, wire-pulling demagogues, 
ignorant as the constituencies that chose them, reckless 
of public duty, and without the faintest notion of what 
true education is." 

In the plan of his memoir, Mr. Farnham 
has departed from the usual method of making 
biography, from cover to cover, a narration of 
events in chronological order. " I have tried," 
he says, "to simplify the reader's labor and 
gain vividness of portraiture, by confining chro- 
nology chiefly to one chapter, thenceforth 
viewing facts and experiences as bearing mainly 
on achievement and development." The work 
thus divides itself into three parts : (1) Park- 
man's preparation, (2) the reflection of his 
personality in his works, and (3) the story of 
his moral growth. 

Mr. Farnham's book is an eminently read- 
able, as well as a searching and scholarly, 
account of the career, personality, and achieve- 
ment of this last of the trio of American his- 
torians Prescott, Motley, and Parkman 
whose works so forcibly refute the curious no- 
tion that charm of style and picturesque narra- 
tion are somehow incompatible with painstaking 
research and historical accuracy. The volume 
is neatly made, and contains two portraits of 
Parkman, one taken in early manhood, the 
other the likeness with which most readers are 
familiar. E. G. J.

Hutchinson Robbing, a descendant of Anne 
Hutchinson, was for nine years speaker of the 
Massachusetts House of Representatives, and 
afterwards lieutenant-governor of the State. 
Through her mother, Elizabeth Murray, she 
was of Scotch descent, and cousin to John M. 
Forbes, a man whose conception of citizenship 
was of the best type our country has produced. 
At sixteen, Anne Jean was graduated from 
the Ladies' Academy of Dorchester. She had 
learned to write a plain, clear hand, and she 
could spell ; for accomplishments, she had ac- 
quired the " use of the globes," and a little 
French and Latin. During the next few years 
we catch glimpses of the young girl, now as- 
sisting in the housework of a large family on 
her father's farm at Brush Hill, and now going 
into society in Boston and New York, making 
her own party gowns. An embroidered cam- 
bric dress of exquisite fineness, and an India 
muslin for a change, worn with different colored 
ribbons, were Anne Jean's party dresses 
through several successive seasons. To please 
the young men who liked to see fair hands 
employed, the young ladies of those days em- 
broidered samplers and mourning-pieces in 
company. An anecdote records a couplet for 
a mourning-piece, which is good enough to 
serve as a general epitaph for fancy work. 
Miss Robbins went to visit some friends of 
hers in Hingham, three quaint ladies who per- 
sisted in remaining British subjects to the end 
of their lives, and who wore purple, Court 
mourning, for George IV., fifty years after 
the Declaration of Independence. A young 
man calling on the ladies one day found them 
busy embroidering mourning-pieces, samplers 
in which tall women in short waists and long 
skirts forever stand weeping by a monument. 
They begged for a motto for their mourning- 
piece, and instantly got this bit of wit : 

" In useless labors all their hours are spent, 
They murder time, then work his monument." 

In the autumn of 1811, Miss Robbins mar- 
ried Judge Joseph Lynian, of Northampton, 
Mass., who was twice her age, and a widower 
with five children. In spite of the disparity of 
years, the marriage was a most happy one, and 
from that time on Mrs. Lyman lived with a 
fulness of life that was at once an inspiration 
and a charm to all who knew her. She was 
the moving spirit, not only in her own home 
as the mother of a large family of children, 
but in an ever-widening social sphere that 
ultimately came to include many of the best- 
known people of her time. 



Northampton in 1811 was a village of about 
four thousand inhabitants, and it had already 
acquired that character which has become 
more marked with the differentiation of the 
place as a college town. There were no very 
rich people and no very poor people, but many 
persons of culture and refinement made their 
homes in the village and enjoyed its beautiful 
scenery in ease and contentment. George Ban- 
croft established there the Round Hill School 
for boys, which became famous all over the 
country. The elder Dr. Flint was the village 
doctor, and Dr. Austin Flint went from North- 
ampton to Buffalo, where in a few years his 
studies in the pathology of typhoid fever gave 
promise of his great medical career. The roll 
of the professors and students of the North- 
ampton law school records the names of Sam- 
uel Howe, Hooker Ashmun, George Tyng, 
George S. Hillard, Russell Sturgis, and others 
equally well known. Every summer an influx 
of visitors came into the valley, for before 
the building of the railroad, in 1843, North- 
ampton was on the high-road between Boston,

Among the birds of passage that flit through 
Mrs. Lyman's letters, we are made acquainted 
with " the great Mr. Wirt," and Mrs. Wirt, 
" not a lady of great mental attainments, but 
of much delicacy and refinement, and good 
judgment, and of many showy accomplish- 
ments." Daniel Webster listens absorbed in 
Miss Flint's music for an hour and a half, and 
then rouses himself to compliment her with 
stately gallantry. On September 13, 1835, 
Mrs. Lyman writes to her son, " Then there 
has been a family of Longfellows from Port- 
land, very interesting, agreeable people." 

During the year 1824 Judge and Mrs. 
Lyman led the little band who " signed off " 
from the First Church, Jonathan Edwards's 
church, and founded the Unitarian society in 
Northampton. The seceders engaged a liberal 
minister to preach to them, and held services 
in the town hall until they could build a church 
of their own. After three years' work the 
health of the Unitarian minister broke down,

* a pious indigent,' but lo ! an angel unawares ! " 
The angel unawares was Ralph Waldo Emer- 
son, with whom Mrs. Lyman then formed a 
friendship that lasted as long as she lived. 
Many years later, when the death of her hus- 
band and the marriage of her last remaining 
child had left her alone in the large house in 
the centre of the village, her diary records 
how Emerson came and spent two days with 
her, how he went with her to visit a poor family 
in whom she was interested, and how he left 
behind him an afterglow of kind words and 
inspiring thought. Emerson's transcendental- 
ism never seemed to disturb her, although at 
one time she fears that one of her children 
had gone over to " those loose enders," mean- 
ing the transcendentalists. To one who could 
not understand Emerson, she said, " Well, you 
call that transcendental. I call it the pro- 
foundest common sense." 

Mrs. Lyman's appreciation of Emerson was 
after all more personal than intellectual, for 
though she had large views of men and things, 
her type of mind was essentially conservative. 
Harriet Martineau visited her, and she was so 
charmed with the English lady's "simple, un- 
affected eloquence" and "delightful character" 
that she began to read her books. The books 
were not so delightful. " I would have excused 
her for everything but her slander of the 
women of our country, and her chapter on the 

* Eights of Women,' in no part of which do I 
sympathize with her. I desire no increase of 
power or responsibility." Only a few years 
before this was written, the little Elizabeth 
Cady was tearing out of her father's law books 
all those laws whose injustice to women made 
her young blood boil with indignation. Mrs. 
Lyman had excellent ideas on education, for 
boys ; her only objection to Mr. Bancroft's 
school was that not enough attention was paid 
to English studies, and she insisted that her 
son at least should study English as well as 
Latin, Greek, and French. Her own education 
had depended on the accident of birth in a 
good family, on the possession of a good mind, 
and a love of reading. But, as in the case of 
women less happily circumstanced socially than 
herself, it does not seem to have occurred to 
her that girls needed a sound mental training 
as well as boys. " It is rare," she writes, " to 
find well educated women who have grown up 
in prosperity. If their minds are tolerably 
cultivated, their hearts are perverted, their 
objects of pursuit are shadows." How could 
women, in prosperity or in adversity, become 



well educated, when there was no endowment 
for the education of girls, and no public opinion 
to demand it? Harriet Martineau raised a 
voice in the wilderness, and Mrs. Lyman found 
it discordant, and refused to listen to it. Just 
so, she was not stirred by the anti-slavery 
agitation, the one great question of her time. 
Lydia Maria Child, her neighbor and friend, 
tells of the many lively encounters she had 
with Mrs. Lyman on the subject, and how she 
only succeeded in getting her on the fence and 
hoped she would jump in the right direction. 
Mrs. Lyman was an indefatigable reader, 
and her letters are full of comments on books, 
couched in the formal language of the last cen- 
tury, and smacking for the most part of its 
taste. She thought Wordsworth " excelled in 
the highest order of poetry, in the moral 
sublime," but the poets she quotes are Aken- 
side and Beattie. The opinion of a cultivated 
woman reading the novels of Sir Walter Scott 
as they came out might have been worth while. 
Mrs. Lyman on Sir Walter is almost as amus- 
ing as she is disappointing. She was some- 
what of an aristocrat in her likings, " In 
reading, nothing is more fatiguing to me than 
minute details of low people, with which I 
think this book [the "Pioneers"], like the 
"Spy," is very much encumbered." They 
tell us nowadays that " minute details of low 
people " is high art. One " trumpery novel " 
did take her off her pedestal, and we have an 
entertaining account of the perturbation it 
caused. " I have read * Jane Eyre,' " she 
writes to her daughter, " and though it is in- 
tensely interesting, I advise you not to read it, 
for I think it has a most immoral tendency." 
By the next post the daughter received a letter 
from a friend who was staying with her mother, 
saying : " Your mother has been completely 
carried away with 'Jane Eyre.' She went out 
yesterday and bought herself a pair of new 
shoes. After she came home she took up 
' Jane ' and read till tea-time ; then she read 
till bed-time. Then I retired, and she read 
till nearly morning, finding, when she went to 
bed at last, that the toes of her new shoes were 
fairly burnt through, over the dying embers." 
Mrs. Lesley suggests that the loss of her shoes 
may have affected her opinion of Rochester, 
for she always became very indignant over 
that part of the story where Jane, after leav- 
ing Rochester, forgot her little bundle of 
clothes. " So shiftless of her," she would ex- 
claim, " to go off without a change of linen. 
I 've no patience with her."

The story well illustrates the local tradition 
of Mrs. Lyman, a woman with an open, in- 
quiring mind, and impulsive nature, full of 
ideas, and possessing a fund of vigorous and 
picturesque English in which to express them. 
When she wrote she was painfully liable to 
make the little fishes talk like whales, but she 
talked delightfully. She had a racy vocabulary 
of her own, full of humor and fun. A certain 
blue print stuff, suggesting orphan asylums, 
which she thought an excellent material for 
her little girls' every-day frocks, she called 
" blue mortification," because they detested it. 
For people who backed down under difficulties, 
" abdicated," in her language, she had no use. 
" Don 't abdicate," she would say, in her large, 
helpful way, to a friend in a peck of trouble. 
" Gild your lot with contentment " was her 
summing up of a complaining woman. She 
writes to her mother: "What with the con- 
flicting claims of society and of children, I 
cannot compare my life this summer to any- 
thing but living on the top of a high tree in a 
great gale of wind, in which all one's efforts 
are bent to holding on." If only the students 
of Smith College would say things in that way ! 

Mrs. Lyman would thoroughly have enjoyed 
the new Northampton, with the thronging col- 
lege girls going up and down the Main street, 
where now a row of shops has displaced her 
home. She would have taken them all into 
her heart and mothered them. Play enough 
they would have had, and discipline. Anne 
Jean Lyman was not an advanced woman, but 
she believed in making the most of opportunity. 
She did it herself, and she saw to it that every- 
body else did who came within her influence. 
She died in 1867, before Smith College was 
founded, and her personality is vague to the 
students. But they all know her name, for 
they go down through the back campus to the 
college garden, where across the lane lies Para- 
dise. And there in the garden are the Lyman 
Plant Houses, the botanical foundation given 
to Smith College by the late E. H. R. Lyman, 
in memory of his mother.

THREE BOOKS ABOUT BUSKIN.* 

We have learned with much regret of the 
decision reached by the literary executors of 
John Kuskin. They have concluded, it seems, 
that a definitive and authoritative biography 
is not desirable, partly because of the existence 
of Mr. Collingwood's admirable book, and 
partly, we presume, because their examination 
of Ruskin's literary remains did not disclose 
any considerable amount of material hitherto 
unpublished. While we are bound to defer 
to the judgment of Professor Norton and his 
associates, we must confess to a certain disap- 
pointment at their decision. Mr. Collingwood's 
biography is excellent as far as it goes, but it 
seems to carry reticence a little too far, and 
certainly has not exhausted the treasures of 
Ruskin's voluminous correspondence. Even 
had his own " Prseterita " been completed, we 
should still wish for the complete record, from 
an objective point of view, of that rich and 
instructive life. Such a record may perhaps 
be given us in the future, but for the present 
we must remain contented with what we have, 
and with the many books about Ruskin, not 
primarily biographical in scope, which have 
been written by his critics and his disciples. 
Three such books have appeared since his 
death, and to give some account of them is the 
purpose of the present article. 

Mrs. Alice Meynell's " John Ruskin " is 
written for the series entitled " Modern English 
Writers." Its method, after a brief introduc- 
tory chapter, is to consider successively and 
briefly Ruskin's principal works, devoting to 
each book (and in the case of " Modern Paint- 
ers," each volume) a special chapter. Each of 
these chapters sets forth the leading ideas of 
the work considered, includes a few illustrative 
extracts, and brings to the discussion a certain 
element of the author's personal idiosyncrasy. 
The author is herself a writer of such distinc- 
tion that this personal note always proves in- 
teresting, although it is sometimes irritating, 
and often excites to protest. Mrs. Meynell's 
literary style, with its excessive desire to be 
nice, does not always produce its effect without 
visible strain, and cannot be acquitted of some-

thing akin to preciosity. When she speaks 
of Ruskin as having got something of his dic- 
tion from Gibbon, " who did more than any 
other to disorganize the English language," and 
when she assumes an air of patronizing superi- 
ority toward Scott, she certainly gives us pause, 
and her critical judgment suffers severe dis- 
credit. But her criticism is, for the most part, 
acute and delicate, the product of a finely 
trained intellect, having just enough of per- 
sonal idiosyncrasy to give it piquancy and to 
make it provocative of thought, without be- 
coming at any time fundamentally unsympa- 
thetic. In dealing with questions of the 
technical art of painting, the writer makes it 
clear that she does not allow even Ruskin to 
do her thinking for her, although she does not 
seem to preserve her complete intellectual 
poise in the discussion of Ruskin's social and 
economic vagaries. 

Mr. M. H. Spielmann's "John Ruskin" is 
a sketch of the life, work, and opinions of its 
subject, put together in a scrappy sort of 
fashion, and not particularly noteworthy for 
style or critical insight. Mr. Spielmann writes 
from the standpoint of a devoted friend and 
enthusiastic admirer, and brings many bits of 
personal reminiscence arid extracts from pri- 
vate letters into his book. The work is chiefly 
valuable for its illustrations, which include 
the series, practically complete, of the portraits 
of Ruskin which readers of " The Magazine 
of Art " will remember as having appeared in 
the pages of that periodical about fifteen years 
ago. The later years of Ruskin's life at Con- 
iston are rather fully sketched, and give us a 
charming picture of the closing chapter of 
his life. 

M. de La Sizeranue's volume entitled " Rus- 
kin and the Religion of Beauty " consists of 
three essays which first appeared in the " Revue 
des Deux Mondes," and which were afterwards 
collected into the book which the Countess of 
Galloway has now translated into English. It 
forms one of the most noteworthy of the many 
recent works in which French critics have dealt 
with English writers in a spirit of the most 
generous appreciation, besides bringing to their 
task a capacity for painstaking investigation 
that puts many of our own writers to shame. 
The pioneer work of Taine has borne rich fruit 
during the past score of years, and of this fruit 
the volume before us is a conspicuous example. 
It is easily the weightiest of the three now 
under review, besides deriving peculiar interest 
from the fact that it records the impressions of 



a competent foreign student of our literature. 
The suggestion of Taine just now made by us 
is more than fortuitous. The writer approaches 
his subject very much as Taine would have 
approached it, and treats it with the same com- 
bination of picturesqueness, vivacity, and philo- 
sophical analysis. He begins by telling us 
how his attention was first called to Ruskin, 
when one day in Florence he came upon a 
party of English girls in Santa Maria Novella, 
reading him in the presence of the frescoes as 
a sort of liturgy. Another year, in London, 
he was the guest of a household in which the 
table linen of the family was a product of 
Langdale, and the host wore a coat of cloth 
made at St. George's Mill on the Isle of Man. 
Again his attention was called to the man 
whose activities had so singular a power of be- 
coming reflected in unexpected ways, and he 
determined to make an exhaustive study of the 
personality that had so aroused, first his curi- 
osity, then his interest, and finally his sym- 
pathy. He determined to " retrace through 
Europe and through the history of ' aesthetic * 
the path the master had trod." How the writer 
prepared himself for his task is told in the fol- 
lowing words : " In Switzerland, at Florence, 
at Venice, at Amiens, on the banks of the 
Rhine or of the Arno, everywhere where he 
had worked I too worked after him, sometimes 
sketching over again the sketches whence he 
had drawn his theories and his examples, wait- 
ing for the same light he had waited for, 
always seeking, as it were, on the eternal 
monuments the fugitive shadows of his thought. 
Then for several years I delayed to write until 
his system dawned upon me, no longer as a 
delicious medley but as a harmony of great 
lines, like those Alpine mountains which he 
loved so well." A work undertaken in this 
spirit, and carried out with this thoroughness, 
could hardly fail to prove an important addi- 
tion to the long list of books devoted to the 
exposition of Ruskin's life and ideas. To the 
non-English reader it must have been a revela- 
tion, and to the English reader it comes as a 
highly stimulating and suggestive treatise, 
although it does not hesitate to quote the pass- 
ages most familiar to him, and to characterize 
the teachings of Ruskin with much detail that 
in the case of the English reader might be left 
for granted. We know of no single volume 
better fitted to serve for an introduction to the 
thought of the great critic. It is clear in its 
exposition and unfailing in its sympathy ; yet 
it does not blink at inconsistencies, and it is

far from giving a slavish adherence to those 
vagaries of temper which have doubtless les- 
sened Raskin's influence, although they are in 
reality but as the spots upon the sun, barely 
affecting his ethical fervor, and in nowise 
making dim the radiance of his resplendent 
genius. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



THE WORLD'S WHEAT PROBLEM.* 



It will be remembered that Sir William 
Crookes, in his presidential address delivered 
in 1#98, at the Bristol meeting of the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science, 
raised a voice of warning in respect to the inad- 
equacy of present methods of cultivation to 
provide a supply of wheat large enough to 
meet the continually increasing demand of the 
world's growing population of bread-eaters. 
He pointed out that the consumption of wheat 
per capita was increasing in almost all the 
wheat-consuming countries and that the num- 
ber of consumers is steadily growing. He 
said : " In 1871 the bread-eaters of the world 
numbered 371,000,000. In 1881 the number 
rose to 416,000,000 ; in 1891 to 472,600.000 ; 
and at the present time they number 516,500,- 
000." 

Observing that the rate of increase appeared 
to be geometrical, he proceeded to inquire 
where were to be grown the additional supplies 
necessary to provide for the additional millions 
of bread-eaters soon to come into being. After 
glancing in succession at the wheat growing 
capabilities of the United States, Russia, India, 
Australasia, Argentina, and various other 
countries, he reached the conclusion that only 
about 100,000,000 acres in addition to the 
area already under wheat 'would be available 
for the production of that grain. At present 
rates of yield, this area, he estimated, would 
barely supply the wheat needed to feed 230,- 
000,000 additional bread-eaters, and this addi- 
tional number, he calculated, would come into 
being by 1931. 

Whence, then, were to come the supplies for 
the further additions to the number of bread- 
eaters to be made after that date, supposing pop- 
ulation to continue increasing at the present 
rate ? Sir William's reply was that increased 
production per acre could alone meet this addi- 
tional demand. This, however, would require 

* THE WHEAT PROBLEM. By Sir William Crookes, F.R S. 
"Questions of the Day" Series. New York. Q. P. Put- 
nam's Sons. 



vast additions to the supply of nitrogenous fer- 
tilizer. Conservation of sewage was referred to 
as one possible source of such fertilizer ; but a 
method of fixing the free nitrogen of the 
atmosphere at a cost sufficiently low to make 
the resulting product commercially available 
was the one thing needful to place at the service 
of mankind a practically unlimited supply. 
This artificial production of nitrate, Sir Will- 
iam regarded as clearly within view ; and in 
this he saw the means of bringing up the aver- 
age yield of wheat from 12.7 to 30 bushels per 
acre. Thus would the date when demand shall 
outrun supply be put so far ahead as to relieve 
the wheat-eaters of the present, and at least a 
few generations of their descendents, from all 
occasion for anxiety. As to a remoter future, 
Sir William suggested that " instead of trust- 
ing mainly to food-stuffs which flourish in 
temperate climates," the nations now composed 
of bread-eaters will " trust more and more to 
the exuberant food stuffs of the tropics," and 
cited a computation of Humboldt, that " acre 
for acre, the food-productiveness of the banana 
is 133 times that of wheat." 

The address thus summarized Sir William 
has included in a volume entitled " The Wheat 
Problem," in which he moreover replies to a 
number of criticisms called out by his Bristol 
address on its original publication. He also 
includes in it a chapter on " Our Present and 
Prospective Food Supply," by the well-known 
agricultural writer, Mr. C. Wood Davis, of 
Kansas ; an article on " America and the 
Wheat Problem," by the Hon. John Hyde, 
Statistician of the United States Department 
of Agriculture ; and a chapter by Mr. Hyde 
on " Certain Fallacies of Mr. Edward Atkin- 
son " in regard to the extent of the ability of 
the United States to contribute to the world's 
wheat supply. Several short appendices and 
an index occupy the last thirty of the 272 
pages embraced in the volume. 

No detailed review can be attempted within 
the space available for the notice of this book, 
but the conviction may be recorded that Sir 
William's views, though somewhat too alarm- 
ist in character, are nearer to the truth than 
those of some of the more optimistic of his 
critics. We do not think there is any serious 
danger of a permanent wheat shortage occur- 
ring within the next thirty-one years, even in 
the absence of that unlimited supply of nitro- 
genous fertilizer to which he looks as a means 
of escape from that calamity; but it may become 
necessary to cultivate less productive lands

than are now in use, in order to produce the 
increased supply of food that will be required 
if population shall continue to multiply as 
rapidly as it has done for many decades past. 
This would mean increased labor for a given 
result, unless the disadvantage named should 
be offset, as it probably would be, by progress 
in agricultural knowledge and corresponding 
improvement in agricultural methods. 

One favorable circumstance is that the in- 
crease of population which is to cause the in- 
creased demand for wheat will probably occur 
chiefly in thinly settled regions in which there 
is much land that will not pay for tillage if its 
produce must find a market thousands of miles 
away, but will become convertible into profit- 
able wheat fields as soon as the growth of pop- 
ulation in its vicinity shall make that produce 
marketable at next to no expense for transpor- 
tation. Moreover, the growth of population in 
such regions, and of the domestic animals by 
which population is accompanied in civilized 
communities, will tend to the utilization of fer- 
tilizing resources that are in great part wasted 
where consumers are thousands of miles from 
the fields where their subsistence is produced. 
If Sir William Crookes had taken due account 
of such changes in the comparative availability 
of land for food production as the growth of 
population will itself bring with it, he would, 
in our opinion, have been able to take a con- 
siderably more hopeful view of the future of 
the world's wheat supply, quite apart from his 
expectation that chemistry will shortly enable 
man to draw on the atmosphere for unlimited 
supplies of nitrogen. Still, he has done a 
useful work in arousing public interest in this 
question, and his book will well repay an atten- 
tive perusal. E> T< p ETERS .

North." Captain Adrien de Gerlache, to whose 
enterprise the expedition owes both its origin and its 
successful issue, appears not to have been less suc- 
cessful than the Norwegian in accomplishing the 
objects for which the " Belgica " was purchased and 
equipped. Ten officers and men of science, and 
nine common seamen, representing five different 
nations, made up the personnel ; but Doctor Nan- 
sen's happy freedom from illness and accident was 
not theirs, one of the sailors being lost overboard, 
and the magnetician, Emile Danco, dying of the 
anaemia which attacked them all in a greater or less 
degree. Dr. Cook reserves the consideration of the 
scientific aspect of this ailment for the more formal 
presentation of the facts gathered by the ship's 
force, and he expressly disclaims an intention of 
setting forth the daily life of the crew ; yet it is 
evident that there was a lack of that marvellous 
good-fellowship which characterized the life on the 
" Fram," due in good part to a lack of choice and 
discrimination in selecting officers and men, and to 
the food, largely Norwegian in character, which 
was not relished by the members of the crew of 
other nationalities. 

The expedition undoubtedly makes valuable con- 
tributions to the world's knowledge. It raises the 
theory of an Antarctic continent to the dignity of 
hypothesis; it extends geographical certainties over 
a vast area of problematical chartings made by 
former voyagers ; it procures for the meteorologist 
hourly readings of the thermometer, barometer, and 
other instruments through a full year ; it establishes 
the probability of a southern polar anticyclone ; it 
moves the theoretical south magnetic pole about 
two hundred miles, all in addition to the minor 
contributions to zoology and kindred sciences. 

It appears from Dr. Cook's interesting and beau- 
tifully illustrated pages that Patagonia and Terra 
del Fuego, still largely believed to be abodes of 
desolation, are thriving and growing countries, with 
their former asperities to be ranked along with 
those of the " Great American Desert " of our boy- 
hood's geographies. The trail of the gold-seeker 
is over them both, and the discovery that sheep 
thrive in the interior has led to the stocking of 
enormous and exceedingly profitable ranches 
and, incidentally, to the extermination of the na- 
tives. This leads Dr. Cook to remark that " The 
Anglo-Saxon is the ruling spirit, and in a very 
short time this long deserted no-man's-land will be 
a gilded paradise stocked with the healthy admix- 
ture of northern races which has made the United 
States the most progressive of the new nations of 
the world."

The ruling spirit of Miss Isabel Savory's narra- 
tive of " A Sportswoman in India" is also Anglo- 
Saxon, and the handsome book, with its thrilling 
pictures, affords the best possible opportunity for 
the psychological study of a modern Una who would 
have slain the lion as a common-sense precaution 
before lying down beside it. History has abundance 
of precedent for the modern Nimrod, and the phe- 
nomenon of a comely British maiden going pig- 
sticking, bear-hunting, and tiger-shooting is probably 
referable to Diana ; yet it is a very modern variety 
of (he goddess that is here presented, with breech- 
loading and rapid-firing arms, and all thought of 
the moon omitted except as affording light for de- 
struction after the sun has set. Mr. Kipling is 
Miss Savory's poet of poets, but she has the habit of 
quoting all her rhyme without using any marks to in- 
dicate originality or indebtedness, leading us to sus- 
pect that some of the lines are her own. Here is an ex- 
ample of her vivacious mingling of prose and verse: 

" On came the pig straight for the Arab's shoulder 
and forelegs a gallant charge. Keeping her horse 
going at best pace, M. leaned well down, intending to

just behind the shoulder, directly he was within reach. 
Her body swung forward as she made the effort 
there followed an instant of deadly sickness Gracious 
heavens! she missed him. It was but an instant; 
home went the pig's charge, and over went the Arab as 
though he bad been a ninepin. M. was hurtled into the 
air, a vision of sky followed, and then stars. . . . She 
did the only thing there was time to do threw herself 
fiat on her face and lay still. In another second the pig 
was cutting what remained of her habit into ribbons, 
and she could feel sharp gash after gash in the small 
of her back as he tore at the body of his prostrate foe. 
Then G.'s voice rang out, and never was woman more 
glad. He speared the boar and drew him off M., who 
sat up once more, considerably bruised and battered, 
but still with plenty of life. The last scenes in such a 
contest would be sad and horrible, if they were not so 
full of danger and excitement. 

The pluck of the bull-dog does not beat 

The pluck of the gallant boar. 

He was magnificent. Furious with rage, again and again 
he literally hurled himself upon the spears in his mad 
longing to get at S. and G., till at last he died, facing 
his foes splendid animal ! It was quite grievous to 
see him lying dead." 

That last touch rises to the heights of the " Walrus 
and the Carpenter." " ' I like the walrus best,' 
said Alice, ' because you see he was a little sorry 
for the poor oysters.' ' He ate more than the 
carpenter, though,' said Tweedledee." 

Another boar was even more fun : After the 
hunt had aroused him, he " rolled over " one na- 
tive, " tilted " another into a well, threw " two 
wretched women, one after another both were 
badly cut," but he " put up a good fight." Small 
wonder that Miss Savory concludes in respect of 
the British " sportswomen " : " The trophies which 
decorate the walls of their sanctum sanctorum call 
forth admiration and reverence, rather than con- 
stitute mute witnesses of outraged womanhood." 



The passion for mountain-climbing is a curious 
evolution of our century. Why should man, with 
incredible hardship, climb to the barrenest, steepest, 
loftiest heights? He will not rest content till he 
has set foot on the topmost peaks and remotest 
poles of this sphere, and thus rightly fulfils his 
mission in subjugating the earth. This restless 
mountaineering spirit animates Mr. W. D. Wilcox's 
book on " The Rockies of Canada." The author 
has spent several seasons exploring Nature's fast- 
nesses in the vicinity of Banff, particularly the Lake 
Louise region ; and he gives us, in simple and lucid 
style, an account of his experiences. It is his 
opinion that " the Caucasus and Alps, especially the 
latter, alone equal or surpass the Canadian Rock- 
ies." While the Rockies of Canada are not as high 
as those of Colorado, "their apparent grandeur is 
greater because the valleys are both deep and nar- 
row, richly forested, and frequently guarded by 
cliffs which are precipitous for three, four, or even 
five thousand feet." The only paths in these Rockies 
are the Indian trails ; and we do not know of a 
better description of the aboriginal road than the 
one here given. 

" But when trails, either good or bad, penetrate it, 
how can a country be unmapped or unknown? Perhaps 
in the same way that the natives have made foot-paths 
through the deserts of Australia and the jungles of 
Africa, the Indians of the Northwest have made trails 
through all the larger valleys of the Rockies. These 
trails, which, for aught we know, represent some of the 
oldest of human foot-paths, are used by the Indians on 
their hunting expeditions. Before the coming of white 
men, they were used as a means of communication be- 
tween the Kootenay Indians and the tribes that inhabit 
the plains, for the bartering of fur, game, and horses. 
So all the important valleys and passes have well- 
marked trails, and the side valleys inferior ones, though 
it is not always easy to find them or stay on them when 
found. A trail is subject to constant degeneration, for 
several reasons. Avalanches and snow-slides sweep 
over it, and sometimes cover a long stretch with broken 
trees and great masses of rock. New areas of timber 
are burned over every year, and the charred trees, after 
standing a few years, begin to yield to the wind and 
storms and fall across the trail. Rapid mountain 
streams often change their courses, cutting away new 
banks and undermining many places where trails were 
made. Even in .the primeval forest, the underbrush 
has a constant tendency to choke these path-ways, and 
aged monarchs of the forest die and fall across them. 
No one ever cuts a tree, if there is a way around, be- 
cause every one assumes, very selfishly, that he may 
never come that way again. Thus the Indian trail is a 
narrow pathway, worn with the hoofs of horses, clearly 
marked in open meadows or deep, mossy forests, but 
ever winding and retreating to avoid a multitude of 
obstacles, and usually disappearing altogether when 
most needed, and some steep cliff or avalanche track or 
burnt timber seems to block the way." 
The book contains a chapter on camping, also one 
on game, and one on the Stony Indians. The 
volume is a handsome one, finely illustrated with 
photogravures, and beautifully printed. It may be 
cordially recommended to all lovers of nature.

Another book on Canada is Mr. E. B. Osborn's 
" Greater Canada." This work treats of British 
Columbia, Alberta, etc., from the practical point of 
view of the farmer and miner ; and it contains also 
much historical material, not easily found else- 
where, on the fur trade. The author vindicates the 
great Northwest as a desirable place of residence. 

" Most people who have not visited the Northwest 
firmly believe that a long winter of arctic rigor pre- 
vents all out-door work during a greater portion of the 
Northwestern year, and forms an insurmountable ob- 
stacle to any such growth in the future. This fallacy 
is a chief cause perhaps the chief cause of the 
preference shown by European emigrants for the States 
as a field for settlement ; and it is still worked for all 
it is worth by Yankee emigration agents, whose tales 
of Canadian climate have caused many new arrivals in 
Boston or New York to change their plans and their 
nationality at the eleventh hour." 

However, a page or two later he acknowledges 
that a temperature of sixty degrees below zero 
does occur. 

" At such times the vapor-laden breath from the 
lungs freezes the moment it leaves the lips, and min- 
gles with the air, and, falling in the form of infinitesi- 
mal snow-dust, produces a soft whispering sound a 
ghostly susurrus, once heard never forgotten." 
The woik contains a good map and useful appen- 
dices, and is certainly a fresh and instructive 
rSsumS. 

Mr. Alfred Austin, Poet Laureate, gives us in 
"Spring and Autumn in Ireland" a very well 
written, thoughtful, and altogether charming ac- 
count of two tours in the Emerald Isle. He finds 
nowhere more of natural beauty and human kind- 
ness, and his characterization of the Irish people is 
very subtle, sympathetic, and suggestive. 

" Of course, my experience was limited and imper- 
fect; but I found myself remarking, no doubt with a 
touch of extravagance, that it must be a very dull 
Englishman who finds Irish people particularly lively. 
Doubtless they are more amiable in the social sense; 
but I cannot put aside the impression that sadness is 
the deepest note in the Irish character. They remind 
one of what Madame de Stael said of herself, ' Je suis 
triste, mais gai.' Under provocation or stimulus they 
become both loquacious and merry; nor need the 
provocation be very forcible. But they readily fall 
back again into the minor key, and much of their wit 
springs from their sensibility to the tearfulness of 
things. ' You can talk them into anything,' said one 
of themselves to me; and I think it is still more true 
that they can talk themselves into anything, for the 
moment at least. They are sad, but not serious." 

We gain from this booklet more real insight into 
Irish scenery and life than from many more pre- 
tentious volumes. We notice one blemish in style 
that is quite ludicrous : 

" I could not gaze on the tender sinuousities of the 
Wicklow Mountains, or turn to the Hill of Howth, Ire- 
land's Eye, and the more distant Lambay Island, with- 
out a sense of rising gladness that I was at last to set 
foot on a land that greets one with so fair and feminine 
a face." 



Miss Helen Caddick was the first woman tourist 
to make the trip to the African Lake Tanganyika, 
and she has described her experiences in a fresh 
and pleasant little book entitled " A White Woman 
in Central Africa." Miss Caddick travelled alone, 
transported in a machila a kind of hammock 
by natives, for more than a thousand miles. 

" From Domasi I went to see a coffee plantation at 
Songani. It seemed to me a rather amusing proceeding 
to take my machila and my seventeen men about with 
me wherever I went. At first I was troubled as to what 
would become of them when I stayed a few days at a 
station; but I found it was the custom, and no one ob- 
jected to my arriving with that number of men, and the 
men themselves were perfectly happy. They always 
took themselves off to the nearest native village, and 
waited with the most absolute indifference just as long 
as I wished. It was perfectly delightful to meet with 
beings who had so much spare time." 

Miss Caddick went by the customary routes, and 
saw only semi-Europeanized Africa ; but in a bright 
and amusing way she notes much that would escape 
the eye of the man traveller. The photographic 
illustrations add to the interest of the book. 

Mr. Frank G. Carpenter has reproduced in book 
form, under the title " South America, Social, In- 
dustrial, and Political," the letters on South Amer- 
ica which have lately appeared in a Chicago news- 
paper. While the author deals with social and 
political life, he is largely concerned with the com- 
mercial aspect of affairs Bolivian gold and silver 
mines, Chilian nitrate deposits, Argentine wheat 
field*, and Brazilian coffee plantations. In Monte- 
video, Uruguay, he found many curious sights. 

" Men go by us with loads on their heads or on their 
backs. Here comes a milk peddler; he is of the same 
style as those of the smaller cities of Argentine Repub- 
lic. He sits on his horse with his legs about its neck 
and almost on top of the leather buckets that contain 
his milk cans. Each one is corked with a round piece 
of wood wrapped in a dirty rag, and I doubt whether 
he changes the rag from one year's end to the other. 
There he has stopped and gone into the house. His 
horse stands still, although there is no hitching-post or 
iron ring in sight. He has hobbled the front feet of 
the animal with the whip. These men supply the city 
of more than 250,000 inhabitants with milk. They 
used to supply it with butter, which they made by gal- 
loping their horses so that the jolting did the churning. 
Then, I am told, when you wanted butter the man 
dipped his hands into one of the cans and squeezed up 
a chunk. It is still the same outside the cities; little 
butter is used by the common people, and there are 
farmers with thousands of cows who eat dry bread." 

Mr. Carpenter's book, though inevitably superficial, 
has a general value as a recent sketch of the South 
American countries, and the illustrations are useful 
and often striking. 

In the present state of interest in Antarctic dis- 
covery, the translation of Dr. Karl Fricker's book 
on " The Antarctic Regions" ought to have attrac- 
tion for the public. This work is a very careful 
and masterly compilation, giving the history of

discovery, the geography and geology of the lands, 
and chapters on climate, ice, fauna and flora, and 
the future of Antarctic discovery. The illustrations 
are notable, being taken from books of travel and 
giving correct views of Antarctic scenery. The 
pictures of icebergs are quite the best we have seen. 
The volume contains a valuable map and bibliog- 
raphy. On the whole, we have here a very reliable 
handbook to the ultima Thule of modern explorers, 
the vast and drear Antarctic. 



BRIEFS ON NBW BOOKS. 



Character and Dr - Paul S ; Reinsch might have 
tendencies of chosen f or his book on " World Pol- 

world politics, itics" (Macmillan) as a suggestive 
sub-title these words : The Appetite and the Meal. 
In Part I., on " National Imperialism," there are 
set forth the rise and characteristics of the appetite ; 
and in Part II., on " The Opening of China," there 
is a description of the meal. The discussion of the 
tendencies now to be observed in the policy of all 
the great states toward aggrandizement at the ex- 
pense of less civilized or weaker peoples, is like a 
fresh breeze coming at the end of a sultry day. 
Instead of confusing the subject with sentimental 
platitudes about destiny, humanity, and the stren- 
uous tasks of duty, he looks at the facts with some- 
thing of the directness of a Machiavelli. Only by 
such a method can the great change that has come 
over the ambitions of Europe, and, in a measure, of 
America, during the last decade or two, be intelli- 
gently defined. It is significant that the Powers 
are seeking more carefully to obtain the utmost 
advantage out of those quasi-possessions upon which 
they merely have a " lien." Dr. Reinsch has de- 
scribed in a particularly enlightening manner how 
this works in China ; how all the improvements in 
one district are to be made with German capital, 
by German engineers, with the use of German ma- 
chinery, etc. ; and how in another district all these 
things are to be French, in another Russian, and so 
on. It apparently has again become necessary to 
revise the Scriptures, so that a familiar passage 
may more truthfully declare, " the earth is the 
white man's and the fulness thereof." The failure 
of the black or brown or yellow man to dig all the 
coal beneath the surface of his lands, to open his 
iron or copper or silver or gold mines, to buy 
European and American goods, is henceforth rightly 
punishable with bombardment and annexation. 
But Dr. Reinsch prophetically warned against so 
treating a great people like the Chinese that their 
slumbering sense of nationality should be awakened. 
The recent troubles in China came as a startling 
confirmation of his foresight. Another significant 
feature of the present movement is its effect in be- 
littling important domestic political questions, and 
in supporting the outcry against intelligent and 
legitimate dissent. This seems to be especially 



characteristic of Germany, and not a little of the 
United States, it might have been added. Issue 
could be taken with minor positions of the author, 
among others, with his notion that the common 
endeavor of the Powers to solve the Far Eastern 
problem may quiet European dissensions. This 
does not seem plausible, if one recalls that a similar 
movement of expansion four hundred years ago had 
no such result. On the whole, the book is perhaps 
the sanest discussion of the new Imperialism that 

has appeared. .

discourse, on methods, is handled, popularly speak- 

Quackery. ing? w i tnout gloves," in Dr. Wm. 

B. Doherty's blunt and practical little book entitled 
" You and Your Doctor " (Laird & Lee). Dr. 
Doherty appears to be not only a " regular " physi- 
cian but a sensible man in the bargain ; and his 
main aim is to define and specify the quack in all 
his noxious varieties, and to set forth in plain terms 
just why quackery is either harmful or else quite 
inoperative. The quack doctor may do you harm ; 
he certainly will do you no good ; and, in any event, 
there is his " little bill " to be considered for your 
quack doctor is emphatically " in medicine " for the 
same reason that Mr. Croker of Tammany is "in 
politics." Of the prevalent and direful custom 
of self-medication, too, Dr. Doherty has some for- 
cible things to say ; and it must be admitted that a 
man consciously turning quack at his own expense, 
and with no earthly prospect of a fee, presents a 
singularly fatuous spectacle. On its positive side 
Dr. Doherty's book offers many useful suggestions 
as to food, drink, exercise, and the cultivation of 
health generally ; as to action in sudden emergen- 
cies of sickness or accident when a physician is not 
within call, and so on. But, thinks Dr. Doherty, 
the right thing to do when you are ailing is to con- 
sult a doctor at once, and be sure that the one you 
consult is a regular practitioner, and not some twig 
or other of the great and growing tree of the Quack 
family. This is, of course, all very plain and nat- 
ural from the standpoint of a physician ; from that 
of a chronic sufferer who consults one doctor after 
another with no appreciable result beyond the fur- 
ther exhaustion of himself and his finances, the 
matter is by no means so simple. We are not sure 
that doctors themselves are wholly free from re- 
sponsibility for the existence of the quackery which 
they deplore. The volume is acceptably made, and 
contains a number of pictures which may serve the 
purpose of impressing its moral more plainly upon 
the popular mind. 

Mrs. Eva Emery Dye calls her 
" McLoughlin and Old Oregon " 
(A. C. McClurg & Co.) a " chron- 
icle." Why not a romance? The book deals with 
important historical matters, but it is impossible in 
any strict sense of the word to call it history. In 
proof of this we cite a single passage, which is, 
however, we are bound to say, the most exaggerated 



Romance and 
history of 
Old Oregon.

THE DIAL 



271 



one that we recall. It relates to the return of the 
gold-hunters from California to Oregon in the early 
fifties : " So the Argonauts came home, bringing 
the Golden Fleece, bags full, tea canisters full, 
pockets full, of the beautiful shining dust. It was 
weighed like wheat or bran, at $ 1 6 an ounce in trade. 
Men carried gold-dust in pails through the streets. 
Women stored it away in coffee-pots and pickle- 
jars. Milk-pans full of it sat on the shelves. Home- 
comers on horseback threw sacks of it over the 
fence into the tall grass to lie over night or until 
they took a bite of supper." But when once the 
reader gets the proper point of view, which he will 
soon do, he will find that the book presents a full 
and graphic account of American beginnings in 
Oregon. Parts of the narrative show real power. 
" Whitman's ride " is made to do duty as a matter 
of course ; but less is made of it in its bearing on 
the territorial question than is sometimes done. 
Webster's remark that the country owed it to Dr. 
Whitman and his associate missionaries that all the 
territory west of the Rocky Mountains north of the 
Columbia was not owned by England and held by 
the Hudson Bay Company, if he ever made it, may 
be true. But this is far from proving that the ride 
had any particular significance so far as the result 
reached is concerned. But we would ask, has not 
the time come when some competent historical 
scholar should subject the Whitman tradition to a 
thorough examination ? 

Mr. Sidney Whitman's " Conversa- 
tions with Prince Bismarck" (Har- 
per) have been discriminatingly 
culled from the indefatigable Herr von Poschinger's 
vast (and still growing) accumulations of Bismarck- 
iana. For a man who did and thought so much, 
the great Chancellor certainly seems to have talked 
a great deal unlike his taciturn colleague Moltke, 
who, as the saying went, could " hold his tongue 
in seven languages." This toiling Geheimrat, von 
Poschinger, has constituted himself a sort of post- 
humous Boswell to the puissant, if loquacious 
Chancellor, and has already put forth some half a 
dozen thick volumes. It is from the latest of these 
that Mr. Whitman has made his selections. The 
contents of the volume range from grave to gay, 
and represent Bismarck at divers periods and in 
various moods. Notable among his interlocutors 
are Li Hung Chang, Thiers, Favre, Mr. John 
Booth (his neighbor at Friedrichsruh), Moltke, 
Maurus Jokai, Bluntschli, and so on. Talking with 
Bluntschli (1868), Bismarck observed, apropos of 
Chamberlain's course in South Africa, that while 
the individual Briton was decent, respectable, and 
trustworthy, the charge of lying being to him the 
worst of all charges, English policy, on the other 
hand, was the reverse of all that ; " its dominant 
characteristic was hypocrisy, and it employed every 
method which the individual Briton despised." The 
Turks he rather paradoxically pronounced to be 
" the only gentlemen in the East "; while of his

own countrymen he said that they were still a race 
of non-commissioned officers " everyone eager to 
get the stripes." Mr. Whitman's book is an excel- 
lent one for those who wish to get, through as little 
reading as may be, a fair notion of the quality of 
Bismarck's inimitable talk. 



An Epic 
Tragedy. 



The episode of Dido, in the Virgilian 
poem, needs only some rearrange- 
ment and the omission of explana- 
tory and descriptive passages to convert it into a 
play. Indeed, while Virgil is the chief epic poet 
on the Latin side, an excellent claim may be set up 
for him as the principal tragic poet of his country. 
The story of Dido, with its singleness of theme and 
its impetuous rush to its catastrophe, constitutes a 
tragedy of the classical sort which the Greek writers 
would have been glad to unfold. In the Virgilian 
epic it rises to a height of interest which perhaps 
no other part of the poem attains. Prof. Frank I. 
Miller and Mr. J. R. Nelson have presented this 
part of the ^neid in an English version (Silver, 
Burdett & Co.), which will no doubt receive the 
wide attention which it deserves. The translation 
is close, clear, and elegant, and has the advantage 
over the William Morris rendering that it is can- 
didly done into modern and not archaic English. 
The long lines reproduce somewhat the effect of 
the hexameter, and preserve the dignity and ele- 
gance of the original. The arrangement into scenes 
has been done with care and skill, and we imagine 
that it should be effective in an actual performance. 
Some portions have been set to music, for which, 
we believe, Mr. Nelson is alone responsible. These 
settings are classical in their character, and are 
really worthy of the place in which they are found. 
The volume will doubtless make its way into many 
hands, and students and teachers of the poem will 
find it a valuable adjunct to the work of appre- 
ciating and understanding the poem of which it is 
so important a part.

clerical experiences. In many of them, pathos and 
fun mingle in pretty even proportions ; and in not 
a few of them children are the chief actors for 
Mr. Brady, like all good men, loves little children. 
A quaint but telling reply was that of the little girl

Brady had baptized to her teasing schoolmates 
who wanted to know " what the man in the night- 
gown had done to her, and if she was now any dif- 
ferent from what she was before." Her theology 
and her hard words exhausted, she dropped sud- 
denly into metaphor and the vernacular with

perfectly satisfactory results : " Well, I '11 tell you. 
I was a little maverick before, and the man put 
Jesus's brand [the Cross] on my forehead, and 
when He sees me running wild on the prairie, He 
will know that I am His little girl." Only now 
and then do the grim features of pain and hardship 
peep from Mr. Brady's sunny pages. We can only 
guess that his long struggle in the Far West was in 
the main a sharp and toilsome one ; for in spirit 
his book throughout is an unconscious and cheery 
homily on the useful theme, " Making the best of it." 

The drama * The l atest * ^ e charming "crepe

of Japan. Hasegawa in Tokyo is a large octavo 

volume entitled " Scenes du Theatre Japonais." 
The greater part of the text is devoted to the most 
famous of the historical dramas of Japan, called 
from the scene in which the action takes place, 
"Terakoya" (the village school). It is translated 
into French by Dr. Karl Florenz, professor in the 
Imperial University of Tokyo, who also supplies a 
brief historical introduction and, at the end of the 
drama, a short account of the conventions of the 
Japanese stage. The tragedy is in one act and thir- 
teen scenes in the continental sense of the word 
and is of an exactness and nicety which suggests 
that the English may go to the subjects of the Mi- 
kado for instruction in the art of dramatic writing 
no less than in the decorative arts in general. The 
translation is from the Japanese into French, and 
is excellently done, it may be conjectured, the 
affinity frequently remarked between the genius of 
Japan and France aiding Dr. Florenz in what is 
evidently a labor of love. But the chief value of 
the book, nevertheless, may be said to lie in the 
beautiful drawings in color which have been made 
for the work by Mr. Yoshimune Arai, giving it a 
charm distinctly its own, and doubling its merits in 

other respects. 

Professor Plehn has " revised and

a somewhat timely chapter on the financial admin- 
istration of war, illustrated by the experience of

work has been revised in any other respect, the re- 
vision is of a kind which it would require an expert 
proof-reader to discover ; yet there are certain in- 
consistencies in the volume which might easily have 
been eliminated in a second edition. Professor 
Plehn is evidently in substantial agreement with 
Mr. Wells concerning the general property tax, for 
he remarks incidentally in his new chapter that 
" the method of taxation by which most of the 
States raise their revenues ... is the worst in use 
in any civilized country." Yet in another place he 
says that the universal condemnation of this tax 
" is not due to the defects in the tax itself, but 
mainly to the fact that it is not properly supple- 
mented by other taxes." Barring some defects, 
the work is a useful text-book in its field.

work, containing minute and detailed descriptions 
of the tools, technical processes, and various systems 
of type-making ; specimens and descriptions of all 
standard sizes of book types ; exhibits of the more 
important type-faces now commonly in use ; tables 
of prices of type here and abroad ; and an im- 
mense amount of similar information heretofore not 
readily accessible. The matter selected for display- 
ing the various faces and sizes of type is of hardly 
less interest than the text proper, consisting as it 
does of short biographies of famous type-founders 
and designers, historical notes on the development 
of printing in various countries, sketches of the 
genesis of well-known type faces, and other matter 
equally pertinent and valuable. To all who have 
to do with the production of books, Mr. De Vinne's 
little treatise must prove indispensable. The Cen- 
tury Co. are the publishers. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Love's Comedy " is the most important of Dr. 
Ibsen's plays that have hitherto remained untranslated, 
and we welcome Professor C. H. Herford's version, now 
published by the Charles H. Sergei Co., both on account 
of the interest of the work and the excellence of the 
translation. Those who have been fortunate enough to 
read Professor Herford's translation of " Brand " will 
not need to be told that in the present instance he has 
proved himself entirely competent to deal with the 
metrical and intellectual difficulties of the earlier work. 
Our obligation to him is still further increased by the 
studied introduction that goes with the volume now at 
hand. 

The collection of pretty white booklets called the 
" What Is Worth While " series, and published for sev- 
eral years past by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., has 
eleven new numbers for this season, and the covers 
have a more tasteful design than ever. Among the new 
titles we note the following: "Spiritual Lessons from 
the Brownings," by Dr. Amory H. Bradford; "Books 
That Nourish Us," by Mrs. Annie Russell Marble; 
" Some Ideals in the Education of Women," by Miss 
Caroline Hazard; " The Art of Optimism," by President 
James De Witt Hyde; The Problem of Duty," by the 
Rev. Charles F. Dole; and " Good Manners and Suc- 
cess " and " The Hour of Opportunity," both by Mr. 
Orison Swett Marden. 

In "The Point of Contact in Teaching" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.) the author, Mr. Patterson Du Bois, first 
states the main idea that his title suggests, and then 
deals with "the plane of experience," "applying the 
principle," " missing the point," and " the lesson ma- 
terial." All this is done with admirable clearness and 
force. The book was written originally for Sunday 
School teachers, but has now been enlarged in scope for 
other teachers who work on the same level of child 
life. It contains more of the pith of teaching than 
many a volume far larger and more pretentious.

iam West, is a " Gem Classic " published by Messrs. 
James Pott & Co. 

The 1901 edition of Messrs. Laird & Lee's useful 
little " Vest- Pocket Diary and Time-Saver" has just 
made its appearance. 

Dr. Mitchell's " Hugh Wynne," in a new edition 
illustrated by Mr. Howard Pyle, is published by the 
Century Co., the two volumes of the original being 
bound into one. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. send us a new edition, 
in two volumes, and published at a moderate price, of 
Professor Edwin A. Grosvenor's important work, "Con- 
stantinople," which first appeared five years ago. 

The pocket edition of "Gulliver's Travels," bearing 
the Dent-Macmillan imprint, is as pretty a book as one 
often sees, and is made exceptionally attractive by its 
series of a dozen illustrations, the work of Mr. A. 
Rackham. 

Two of the five volumes which are to contain Lock- 
hart's " Memoirs of Walter Scott " are published by 
the Messrs. Macmillan, under the editorship of Mr. 
A. W. Pollard, in their " Library of English Classics." 

Mr. John Edward Courtenay Bodley's " France " is 
published by the Macmillan Co. in a new edition at a 
reduced price. The two volumes are bound in one, 
which thus contains an aggregate of nearly a thousand 
pages. 

Mr. William Stone Booth of the Macmillan Co. is 
the compiler of a little manual of " Notes for the 
Guidance of Authors," which will be found of great 
practical value by all who have occasion to prepare 
manuscript for publication. 

" Animal Life," by President D. S. Jordan and Pro- 
fessor V. L. Kellogg, is one of the " Twentieth Century" 
series of text books published by the Messrs. Appleton. 
It is an elementary account of animal ecology, abun- 
dantly and interestingly illustrated. 

" The Nuttall Encyclopaedia," as edited by the Rev. 
James Wood, is reissued by Messrs. Frederick Warne 
& Co. in an edition which is numbered as the "twen- 
tieth thousand." Its sixteen thousand brief articles 
make the volume a very useful one for ready reference. 

Mr. Charles Raymond Barrett's treatise on " Short 
Story Writing " appears in a second edition from the 
press of the Baker & Taylor Co. It is an interesting 
little book, and may be found useful by beginners in 
literature, although the art with which it deals is hardly 
one to be taught. 

A valuable collection of rare and scarce old English 
books will be sold at auction by the Williams, Barker 
& Severn Co., of Chicago, beginning Oct. 22 and con- 
tinuing the three following days. The catalogue of 
the sale contains over 1500 numbers, including many 
items of exceptional interest. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have begun a new and 
attractive series of reading-texts for young people, en- 
titled " Home and School Classics." The following 
numbers have appeared : " The Tempest," abridged and 
edited by Mrs. Sarah Willard Hiestand; "Chapters on 
Animals," by Philip Gilbert Hamerton, edited by Pro- 
fessor W. P. Trent; "The Wonderful Chair and the 
Stories It Told," by Miss Frances Browne, edited by 
Professor M. V. O'Shea; " Jackanapes," by Mrs. Ewing, 
edited by Professor W. P. Trent; and "Goody Two 



Shoes " (which Goldsmith may have written), edited 
by Mr. Charles Welsh. These publications are neat 
pamphlets, illustrated, and are to appear semi-monthly. 
They are priced at ten and fifteen cents each. 

The small pamphlet of " Songs for the City of God," 
which Mr. David Nutt has just published, has a wider 
scope than most sacred anthologies, and is made notable 
by the inclusion of poems by Tennyson, Clough, Morris, 
Mr. Henley, Mr. Kipling, and Mr. Swinburne. The 
judgment displayed in this selection is distinctly out of 
the ordinary. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. continue their work in 
the publication of serviceable and inexpensive editions 
of the standard poets. Chaucer and Burns are now 
added to their list, each in a boxed two-volume set. The 
Chaucer has facsimiles, a glossary, and an introduction 
by Professor Lounsbury. The Burns is edited in sim- 
ilar fashion by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole. 

The welcome announcement is made that the famous 
" Easy Chair " department of " Harper's Magazine " is 
to be revived, with Mr. W. D. Howells as incumbent, 
than whom it would be hard to suggest a more fitting 
successor to the genial " Ik Marvel " and " Howadji," 
whose writings have made the " Easy Chair " so mem- 
orable. At the same time will be restored the "Editor's 
Study," to be conducted by Mr. Henry Mills Alden, 
present editor of the Magazine. In addition to his 
" Easy Chair " duties, Mr. Howells will become a liter- 
ary adviser to the firm of Harper & Brothers, and will 
also contribute a monthly article on contemporary lit- 
erary affairs to the " North American Review." With 
his various other writings, and the occasional novels 
which we hope Mr. Howells will continue to give us, 
there seems little probability of his becoming rusty.

I have read THE DIAL for years, and it has always 
given me the impression of being in the company of 
refined gentlemen agreeably relating the literary affairs 
of the day. S. WEIR MITCHELL. 

Philadelphia, March 28, 1900. 

From no literary journal, foreign or domestic, have 
I derived more profit than from THE DIAL, during the 
twenty years of its existence. 

EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN. 

Bronxville, N. Y., April 14, 1900. 

THE DIAL has gained the solid respect of the coun- 
try as a serious and impartial journal of literary criti- 
cism, without resorting to pictures or personalities, 
or mistaking the back- stairs gossip about writers for 
literature. CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. 

Norfolk, Va., April 2, 1900. 



In the November number SARAH ORNE JEWETT 

contributes the opening chapters of 



The Tory Lover 



MISS JEWETT has just completed an American 
historical romance which has occupied her atten- 
tion for several years, and which exhibits in a new field 
the rare qualities of her art. It will be one of the 
features of the ATLANTIC for 1901. She has chosen 
a theme hitherto untouched by our fiction writers, the 
fortunes of the Loyalists in the early days of the Rev- 
olution. The story opens in the rich provincial neigh- 
borhood of the Piscataqua River, upon ground familiar 
to the readers of Miss Jewett's short stories. It con- 
cerns itself later with the adventures of the exiled 
Tories, and with the exploits of the frigate Ranger on 
the French and English coasts. 



Three Months' Trial Subscription for THE DIAL and THE ATLANTIC will be entered on 
receipt of Seventy-five Cents (in stamps or postal money-order), from any person whose name 
does not now appear on the subscription list of either publication. Address

The"Al=Vista" ^ : 
Panoramic 
Camera 

Has accomplished the feat of covering in a single expos- 
ure a scope of about 180 degrees. When you consider 
that this is one-half of the horizon exposed from any 
given location, the surprising nature of the accom- 
plishment is realized. Two streets running at right 
angles can now be photographed successfully at one 
exposure and other equally difficult feats are possible. 
For photographing broad landscapes, mountain ranges, 
marine views, yacht races, field sports of all kinds 
in fact, any view spreading over a large area the 
" Al- Vista " does what no other camera ever did or 
can do. 

Another surprising feature is, that pictures of vary- 
ing lengths can be made with one camera and on the 
same roll of film something accomplished by no other

tions by NATHAN HASKELL DOLE,

There has been for some time a growing demand for 
a complete edition of the Works of Count Tolstoi. 
This desideratum we have at last supplied. This is 
really a whole library in itself fiction, history, mor- 
als, ethics, philosophy, argument, and practical common 
sense being abundantly represented. Each volume 
contains an introduction by Nathan Haskell Dole. Not 
only has a large mass of his writings hitherto inacces- 
sible to English readers been translated, but occasion 
has been taken to revise with the utmost care the earlier 
works. " Anna Kare*nina " has been translated en- 
tirely new from the original Russian, and is now abso- 
lutely complete and unexpurgated. The author's latest 
novel, " Resurrection," in which the veteran novelist in 
the very plenitude of his powers returns to his legiti- 
mate field, is presented in an authorized translation 
made with the utmost care by Mrs. Alymer Maude, 
who has been enabled to insert in their proper places 
many important passages which the Russian censor 
compelled the publishers of the original to omit, and 
which are not found in either the French or German 
versions. We feel justified in claiming that this library 
of Tolstoi's writings, practically representing his entire 
life work, and wholly translated from the original 
Russian, is one of the most important collections of 
literary material ever offered to the American public.

The Trent Edition 



OF 



BALZAC'S WORKS 



Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

Have just completed a new Edition of 
Balzac, printed from new plates, with in- 
troductions by Professor William P. Trent 
of Columbia University. 

The increasing interest in Balzac's writ- 
ings is something phenomenal, and this 
edition will be welcomed by those who 
desire to familiarize themselves with his 
" Human Comedy " through the medium of 
a scholarly and accurate translation of 

"The World's Greatest Novelist." 

Popular Edition. 16 vols. Cloth, $16.00. 

Library Edition. 16 vols. Cloth, gilt top, 
$20.00. Half Calf, $40.00. 

De Luxe Edition. 32 vols. Cloth, gilt top, 
$40.00. Half Calf, $80.00. 

Illustrated with photogravures and half tone 
reproductions of etchings by famous artists, and 
quaint wood-cuts from the French edition. 



The Trent Edition of Balzac is the best popular 
edition ever offered to the English-speaking world. 
The translation is not only accurate and scholarly, 
but even the literary finish has been preserved. 
Professor William P. Trent of Columbia Uni- 
versity has written the general introduction, con- 
taining a full and scholarly sketch of Balzac's 
life, and also a special introduction to each of the 
volumes. There is, moreover, a full bibliography. 
No man in the United States is better qualified to 
do this work, and Professor Trent may well be 
proud of the edition. 

This work is now ready in 16 volumes and 82 volumes. 
A Descriptive Catalogue or Circular showing Types, 
Illustrations, etc., will be sent upon application to the 
publishers.

" AMERICA: Picturesque and Descriptive" presents in an interesting form such a knowledge as 
the busy reader would be pleased to have in one comprehensive view of the history, geography, picturesque 
attractions, productions, peculiarities, and salient features of this great country, not only as a work of 
reference and a work of art, but as a book of readable interest as well. Especial care has been taken with 
the photogravures that illustrate it, and it is a sumptuous work of art as well as an entertaining and valuable 
work in the letter-press. 

Myron W. Hazeltine ("M. W. H."), gives this work a four-column laudatory advance review 

in the New York Sun of October 7.

In our regular PHOTOGRAVURE SERIES, uniform with Cook's "America," "England," etc. It 
will fill a want that has long existed for a readable and compact as well as comprehensive volume upon the

eminent of the day he brings to his task literary graces that lend a singular fascination to this study 
of the greatest man of action England has produced. The tercentenary of Cromwell's birth has called 
forth many books and pamphlets, among which the first place will doubtless be accorded by the literary

A Memorial Edition with Two Hundred and Fifty Illustrations. 

A superb volume, prepared under the patronage of the Danish Government, and issued simultaneously

'THE approach of the centenary of the birth of the famous Danish story-teller is commemorated by the 
issue of a monumental edition of his best work, illustrated by the greatest living Danish artist, Hans 
Tegner. The preparation of these illustrations has occupied eleven years, and the original pictures, after 
being exhibited in Paris, are to be shown in London, and later, probably, in New York. Their ultimate 
resting place will be the Copenhagen Museum. Mr, Edouard Detaille declares Mr. Tegner's work to be a 
veritable national monument. The work will be issued in Denmark, France, Germany, England and America. 
For the English edition an entirely new translation has been made by Mr. Brsekstad ; and Mr. Edmund 
Gosse, who enjoyed the personal friendship of the poet, furnishes the introduction. The full-page pictures

THE CRITIC'S SERIAL STORY 


THE CRITIC 

An Illustrated Monthly Review of Literature, Art, and Life. 

Yearly Subscription, $2.00; Per Number, 25 Cents. 

\A7ITH the November number THE CRITIC will begin the publication of a serial story 
by a writer new to American readers, but who, once introduced, is likely to remain 
as great a favorite here as he is in his own country. The name of this story is a most 
attractive one: 

THE FOREST SCHOOLMASTER 

The Author is 

PETER ROSSEGER 

And the authorized translator from the German original is FRANCES E. SKINNER. 
While the story of The Forest Schoolmaster deals largely with Nature, it is a study 
of Nature's children as found in the far-away forests of Germany. It is believed to be 
largely autobiographical ; at any rate, the author has lived among the people of whom he 
writes, and knows them as no other man could. The story is original, powerful, and likely 
to attract the attention of those who read for something more than mere amusement. 
THE CRITIC'S readers are to be congratulated upon their good fortune in having this 
remarkable novel brought to their attention, and we are sure that its development will be 
eagerly awaited from month to month. 


With its January number THE CRITIC will enter upon its twenty-first year. To cele- 
brate this interesting occasion it will be substantially enlarged, the size of the type 
page will be increased, and it will thereafter be printed in double columns. Arrange- 
ments have been made with the leading writers of America and England for contributions, 
and the editors predict that THE CRITIC for 1901 will be a surprise and a delight to its 
readers.

CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. 

The death of Charles Dudley Warner, on 
the nineteenth of October, removed a conspic- 
uous figure from the rapidly-thinning ranks of 
our older authors, causing heartfelt grief to 
the thousands of his personal acquaintances 
and the tens of thousands of his friendly read- 
ers. Among our men of letters, the oldest 
group now represented among the living is 
the one which was born in the third decade of 
the century, and to that group Mr. Warner 
belonged. It was a notable set of men, for it 
included among the dead such names as Park- 
man, Curtis, Boker, Taylor, Frothingham, 
White, Child, Winthrop, Bead, Hayne, and 
Johnston, and still happily includes among the 
living the honored names of Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale, Mr. Donald G. Mitchell, Col. 
T. W. Higginson, Mr. Charles G. Leland, 
Mr. Richard H. Stoddard, Mr. Henry C. Lea, 
Mr. Charles Eliot Norton, and Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell. With the last-named of these men 
Mr. Warner was exactly contemporary, hav- 
ing 1829 for the year of his birth. 

Mr. Warner's long and busy career in- 
cluded many things besides literature in its 
activities, and for some time, at least, the pur- 
suit of letters was rather an incidental occu- 
pation than a chosen vocation. Born in 
Massachusetts, he was educated in New York, 
and was graduated from Hamilton in 1851. 
Meanwhile, he had been a druggist's assistant 
and a post-office clerk, and was ambitious to 
become a Congressman. He went to Missouri 
with a surveyor's party, returned to civilization 
to study law at the University of Pennsylva- 
nia, and then practiced his profession in Chi- 
cago. Just before the Civil War he was 
invited to an editorial position by his friend, 
Mr. Joseph R. Hawley of the Hartford 
" Press." When Mr. Hawley took the field, 
his young assistant was left in charge of the 
paper, which afterwards became merged in the 
Hartford " Courant," with Mr. Warner as one 
of the owners. This journalistic connection 
was continued through the rest of his life, 
although he freed himself from the routine 
work in his later years. 

Mr. Warner's graduation from journalism 



294 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



into literature may be said to date from the 
publication, in 1870, of " My Summer in a 
Garden." This book consisted of sketches 
that had been written for the " Courant," and 
which achieved instant success when they ap- 
peared in book form. Even the English public 
was won, and the " Quarterly Review " said of 
the book that " Charles Lamb might have 
written it if he had had a garden." This vol- 
ume was soon followed by " Saunterings," 
' Backlog Studies," " Baddeck and That Sort 
of Thing," " Being a Boy," In the Wilder- 
ness," " My Winter on the Nile," and " In the 
Levant," all published during the seventies, 
besides a share in the writing of " The Gilded 
Age." The essay, descriptive or sentimental, 
had become his favorite form of composition, 
and he infused into these books no small 
amount of genial humor and delicate criticism 
of things and scenes, of men and books. At 
a later period, his essay-writing was done 
chiefly for " Harper's Magazine," in whose 
pages he held monthly discourse for many 
years the sort of writing which we find in 
his two small volumes, " As We Were Say- 
ing " and " As We Go." As editor of the 
" American Men of Letters " series, he dis- 
played good judgment in his selection of writ- 
ers, and himself undertook the biography of 
Irving, which is one of the most satisfactory 
volumes of the collection. He was the nom- 
inal editor of the " Library of the World's 
Best Literature," although his brother, Mr. 
George H. Warner, shouldered most of the 
detail of this editorial undertaking. His for- 
eign travels, illustrated by two titles already 
given, are still further recorded in the pages 
of " A Roundabout Journey," but, on the 
whole, he preferred the investigation of his 
own country to his European saunterings, and 
his numerous trips through different regions 
of the United States bore fruit in such books 
as "Their Pilgrimage," "On Horseback," 
"Our Italy," and "Studies in the South and 
West." 

Charming as are these many volumes of 
essays and impressions de voyage, we are in- 
clined to believe that Mr. Warner made his 
most enduring contribution to literature when 
he wrote, during the last ten years of his life, 
the series of three novels which provide so 
suggestive a portrayal of what American life 
has become in its older centres of civilization, 
and in these latter days of frenzied commercial- 
ism and pitiful social ideals. "A Little Journey 
in the World," "The Golden House," and 



" That Fortune," make up a sort of novel- 
trilogy which will always have deep interest as 
a set of social documents, and which comes 
near to the high- water mark of American 
fiction. There is in these books a riper thought 
and a deeper humanity than were wont to 
characterize the author's earlier writings ; if 
they are lacking in the quality that goes to the 
making of the best class of novels, it is because 
they are essentially the product of the critical 
rather than of the creative intellect. But their 
mellow optimism, and their persistent exalta- 
tion of ideals of conduct that have gone too 
much out of fashion of late years, give these 
three novels a place all but the highest in our 
fiction, and set a worthy crown upon the activ- 
ities of a long and helpful life. 

Mr. Warner was what is known as a public- 
spirited man. His energies were enlisted in 
behalf of many good causes, from abolition to 
prison reform, from the Egypt Exploration 
Fund to the Park Commission of his adopted 
city. Many topics of education and social 
science engaged both his pen and his tongue, 
for he was a ready public speaker, at once 
genial and forcible in the presentation of what- 
ever cause might have enlisted his convictions. 
The city of Chicago remembered him as a 
young lawyer in the fifties, and welcomed him 
upon his many subsequent visits. And the 
Twentieth Century Club of this city is proud 
of the fact that he was the first speaker to 
address its members, when it was organized 
eleven years ago. The place which his death 
has left vacant in our literary life will not 
easily be filled, and the circles that may know 
his living presence no more will long hold his 
personality in affectionate remembrance. 



THE MADISON LIBRARY. 

The capital city of Wisconsin was busy, week 
before last, with a peculiarly interesting celebration. 
The great library building, which has been in 
process of erection for several years, was formally 
opened for the use of students, and its dedication 
to the service of scholarship was signalized by fitting 
ceremonies, including a masterly address by Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams, the chosen guest of the 
occasion. This building, which embodies the most 
advanced .principles of library construction, is the 
joint property of the State University and the 
State Historical Society, and provides suitable 
shelter for the collections of both institutions 
collections which comprise in the neighborhood of 
three hundred thousand bound volumes and pam- 



1900.] 



THE DIAL

phlets, exceptionally rich in materials for the study 
of American history. The building itself takes its 
place in the front rank of what we may call the 
second group of library structures. It is not to be 
compared for cost or dimensions with the Library 
of Congress, or with the Public Libraries of Boston 
and Chicago, or with the great Public Library 
which New York will have in due course of time. 
But among university libraries, its position is prob- 
ably second only to the building which Columbia 
University owes to the munificence of its President. 
At all events, it is a noble structure, and its posses- 
sion may well be a matter of civic pride to the 
commonwealth which has borne the cost of its 
erection. 

The special note of the Madison dedication was 
historical, and this emphasis is fully justified both 
by the fact that the department of history is one of 
the strongest in the University, and by the fact that 
the State Historical Society claims about two-thirds 
of the collection of books now permanently housed. 
We may say further that it was to American his- 
tory, rather than to history in general, that the 
building was dedicated, and, if it be not invidious 
to mention names, that it stands in some measure 
as a monument to the distinguished services ren- 
dered to this department of American scholarship 
by Professor Frederick J. Turner of the University 
and President Reuben G. Thwaites of the Histor- 
ical Society. To these men, and to the scholars 
who, in other centres of learning, have for the past 
quarter-century been engaged in examining the

dignity in which it was previously lacking, and have 
made it a new force in the educational and intel- 
lectual life of our nation. 



TENDENCIES OF AMERICAN LITERATURE 
Iff THE CLOSING QUARTER OF THE CENTURY. 

Among those who lead the strenuous life 
which seems to mean strenuously blowing one's 
own horn as it has never been done before, at least 
not since the Jews toppled over the walls of a city 
with the sounding of their trumpets among 
these it is easy to award the victor's crown. 
Superior strenuousness tells instantly, and gets its 
reward. But the contests of literature are not 
to be decided off-hand. Contemporary fame is 
usually temporary fame ; and a quarter-century is 
too short a time for forming a safe opinion. The 
contemporary critic, indeed, has a task not unlike 
that of Joan D'Arc, when she was brought into 
the throng of kingly-attired courtiers and bidden 
distinguish the true king. One should be a prophet, 
or inspired, to attempt the business. It is much 
easier to try to point out some of the tendencies of 
the literature under review, to show what material 
it has dealt with, and in what spirit. 

The death of Lowell may perhaps be taken as 



the sign of dismissal of our great literary past. 
He was of the giant race before the flood. He was 
the rear-guard of our Grand Army of poets and 
thinkers which for awhile conquered and possessed 
the somewhat frozen waste of American life. He 
was the last, or almost the last, of the men of im- 
agination, and he survived on a good while into 
the time of the men of fact. In one or two of his 
latest essays, he seems in a rather puzzled way to 
be trying to get his bearings in the new and alien 
world around him. A few inheritors of the old 
faith remain Mr. Stedman, Mr. Stoddard, Mr. 
Aldrich, and Mr. Gilder ; but they have been unable 
to make head against the powers that thrust even 
Lowell into something like literary obscurity in his 
final years. 

In his essay on Gray, Lowell remarks that there 
was a spiritual east-wind blowing in that writer's 
time, under which no poet could flower. The last 
quarter- century in American literature is like a 
piece of the English eighteenth century dropped 
into ours. There is the same subsidence of passion, 
the same treatment of imagination as a sort of a 
poor-relation whom it were dangerous to encourage, 
the same turning from philosophy to fact. The 
English eighteenth century took long cooling 
draughts of skepticism and rational Theism, to 
soothe the fever in its blood and lay the ghosts in 
its brain. We have had the anaconda feast of 
Evolution to make us lethargic and comfortable. 
Both epochs are notable for the refusal to be 
bothered with the mysterious and unknown, and 
for their cheerful facing of the workaday world. 
For religion the intense and possibly selfish 
passion for saving one's own soul they both sub- 
stituted politics and philanthropy the lively 
interest in keeping alive and directing the bodies 
of our neighbors. Solitude on the mountain heights 
has seemed to both ages a little ridiculous, and 
society in the cities more suited to their turn of 
mind. 

The chief note in eighteenth century literature 
was humor; and this is paralleled by our recent 
work. In neither case is it humor of the world- 
shaking sort, the humor which Socrates must have 
had in mind when he said that the tragic and comic 
poet should be one. Bather it is the humor of 
hearty good- sense, of gentle irony, or of almost 
apologetic satire. It has produced the books of 
that Daily Life which FitzGerald found so insuf- 
ferable in practice. Pope and Johnson and Gold- 
smith and Jane Austen are great apostles of the 
religion of common-sense the doctrine of houses 
with roofs to them, and clothes without holes in 
them, and a working code of morals ; and so, 
allowing for differences of time and talent, are Mr. 
Howells and Mr. James. The literature of common- 
sense is sound and wholesome enough but it 
is a trifle obvious. We all know that we must 
work or starve, and that we have got to be toler- 
ably good or the police will get us. Surely the 
main use of art and literature is to lift man up

intoxicate him, and make him forget the curse of 
Adam. We want to be taken out of ourselves 
or, rather, we want to realize our better selves of 
which we are conscious ; and so we sympathize far 
more with the exceptional than with the common- 
place. This natural instinct has been sadly starved 
by our late literature. Mr. Howells has exiled the 
Exceptional Character from bis novels, and pursued 
him with fury in his criticism. It is a striking tes- 
timony to his force, that he has compelled us to 
accept the trivial and uninteresting as important. 
Partly the tendency of the times was with him, 
partly his unceasing polemic compelled attention, 
and partly the ease and lightness of his work won 
conviction. He is, indeed, the most easily read 
author of the day. And Mr. James is the cleverest. 
The mania of cleverness is in him more than in 
Mr. Meredith. For my part, I never realized that 
human nature was so complex and subtle, that the 
average citizen or ordinary baggage in muslin car- 
ried about with them such immeasurable meaning. 
After puzzling over Mr. James's hieroglyphics, 
there is something to be said for the old black-and- 
white treatment of human nature. 

If these two novelists have been the Cabinet 
Ministers of our recent literature, Mr. Bret Harte 
has been the Leader of the Opposition. Humor is his 
characteristic, too ; or else his delight in wild scenes 
and characters, his ability to mould in the round 
his hunks of human nature and original sin, might 
have lifted him to the heights of tragedy or romance. 
Humor is of course the essence of Mr. Stockton's 
art, a humor of queer contorted common-sense. 
Mr. Cable is another humorist, and perhaps the 
most artistic of all, unless Mr. Hopkinson Smith 
matches him. This last writer's " Colonel Carter " 
is worthy of a place on the shelf with the " Vicar 
of Wakefield." Mr. Page is a humorist with pathos, 
and Mr. Joel Chandler Harris a humorist with pro- 
fundity. Mr. Chambers is an artist-humorist of 
exquisite gifts. Humor which recurs so persistently 
in all these writers has become a profession to a 
legion of others whom it is needless to name. Their 
work is almost the least satisfactory product of 
American energy. It is funny, it is grotesque, it 
is rib tickling ; but it is, after all, only the supreme 
effort of the clown with the horse-collar. One feels 
that the dignity of human nature is violated by it. 
A good deal of Mark Twain's earlier work was of 
this type, and in fact he might almost be credited 
with or accused of originating it. But the creator 
of the immortal " Tom Sawyer " and " Huckleberry 
Finn " has soared far above his imitators, and given 
us classics of pure delight. 

A second note of the eighteenth century was the 
predominance of historical writing. The greatest 
history since the ancients, the best biography in the 
world, and some of the best memoirs, were the 
product of that time. This historic activity is 
equalled in quantity, if not in quality, in recent 
American literature. Dr. Fiske, Professor Mc- 
Master, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Bancroft, and others, have 



reared monuments of industry and research as im- 
posing in mass and extent as the pyramids or the 
Great Wall of China. I must frankly confess that 
I have only the slightest acquaintance with these 
spacious and minute works. What knowledge I 
have of them leads me to think them chronicles 
rather than histories. Their authors give every- 
thing. None of them has the courage and cheerful 
good heart of Gibbon, who was capable of saying, 
" Nothing important happened in this century," or 
"The fourth, fifth, and sixth crusades were only 
repetitions of the first, second, and third." I am 
willing to allow our historians every merit in the 
world save that of felicity of subject. Two of 
America's earlier historians, Prescott and Parkman, 
fell heir to themes which must always thrill and 
fascinate. That so much can be said for the re- 
corders of our last hundred and fifty years, is more 
than doubtful. America wears Benjamin Franklin 
in her disposition ; " Poor Richard " has made a 
continent prosaic. It is not that we have lacked 
great deeds and great men ; on the contrary, it is 
because we have had a certain level prosperity of 
luck in both, that single figures and actions are left 
without relief. There is a story of a man who lost 
his shadow. America is in somewhat like case. 
The want of any shading in the popular presenta- 
tion of the protagonists of our history has long been 
felt. Professor McMaster a good while ago gave 
Franklin a judicious touch of black, and recent 
memoir writers have eagerly followed suit. The 
Real Franklin, the Real Penn, the Real Lafayette, 
have been presented to us. The authors of these 
studies have cut out and fitted to their heroes the 
most artistic shadows in graduated tints. But 
somehow they do not seem to succeed. One seems 
still to see the old heroes going about in their pre- 
vious ghost-like state, and anxiously inquiring of 
each other, "Have you seen my shadow lately?" 
or, "Is my halo on straight?" Absolute uncon- 
scious delight in human nature in all its manifesta- 
tions is the first law of creative art. Historians 
are mostly bad artists because they have to praise 
or blame. Possibly our new school of historic ro- 
mance is to do for American history what Shake- 
speare and Scott did for England. 

Our recent period again resembles the eighteenth 
century in its interest in education. Cold epochs 
always believe in education and training. When 
men's blood is hot with passion, when their brains 
are flushed with poetry and their lives filled with 
romance, they can educate themselves. The ten- 
dency of our education has been toward the con- 
crete, the real, the practical ; we have shunned the 
abstract and the universal. There are not lacking 
signs that educators see they have gone too far, 
that they have been training parts of men rather 
than complete ones, that instead of making each 
man a world in himself they are making him an 
insignificant part of the world without. We may 
not get back to the humanities and the categories as 
a basis of education, but some synthesis will come.

Another note of our literature has been disper- 
sion. I might say democracy, but democracy is 
a queer thing, and comes out where it is least ex- 
pected, and is missed where it is most looked for. 
There was more democracy in the court of Louis 
XIV. than in the rich bourgeois circles of America. 
But dispersion the lack of any central authority, 
of any place of congregation for authors, or any 
permanent types of humanity for them to repre- 
sent, has been a very marked feature of our 
time. Every nook of the land has been searched 
for local color, every dialect has been phonographed, 
and many of our writers have seemed to think that 
all that was necessary for originality was a new 
dislocation of language or a delineation of novel 
crudity of human nature. 

Humor, historical study, education, and local 
exploitation, these seem to me the main lines our 
literature has followed for the last quarter century. 
The note of great poetry has been unsounded, or 
at least unheard. It may be that some of the many 
claimants to the laurel crown will yet make good 
their title. One of them, indeed, Sydney Lanier, has 
friends who would place him with our best. I can- 
not agree with this estimate. There are good lines 
in "The Marshes of Glynn," and some bird-like 
movements in his lyrics, but nothing extraordinary, 
and I think it is safe to say that there are twenty 
contemporary verse-writers who have done more 
and better in poetry than Lanier. No phrase of 
his has passed into general circulation no poem 
of his has haunted the mind of the world ; and he 
has had no imitators or parodists. He has been 
dead long enough for those phenomena which 
follow great poetry to appear. They have not ap- 
peared, and I must enter a caveat against his claim. 
His book on " The Science of English Verse " is 
equally unsatisfactory. Music and the rhythm of 
verse are alike subject to the laws of motion or 
vibration and so is everything else, as far as we 
can find out ; but that poetry, the most comprehen- 
sive of the arts, is a sub-species of music, as Lanier 
would imply, is a far-fetched fancy. Rowland 
Sill's most melancholy and musical verse has great 
charm ; and some of Emily Dickinson's rugged 
rhythms, with their gleams of profound insight and 
their revelation of a personality almost as strong 
and strange as Emily Bronte's, are like to live. 

Good and sound and of excellent workmanship 
is the great mass of recent American literature ; 
but as the idealist gazes on it he seems to see the 
vision of a great strand whereon some tempest has 
driven a fleet of deeply -laden ships. Everything for 
human needs is strewn about food and raiment, 
and tools, and precious objects. And many of the 
ships are seaworthy; but no flood comes and no 
wind rises to waft them off the sand. The agitating 
power of poetry, the tempestuous stir of great ideas, 
are wanting to make the fleet march again in tri- 
umph over the deep. 

There have been times when the things of the 
mind or soul were dominant in the world and drew 



all the other affairs of life after them. They are 
certainly not dominant now. We are industrial, 
we are commercial, but we are not religious or 
artistic. Yet we are very well satisfied with our 
civilization, and are wanting, with our English 
cousins, to impose it on the rest of the world. The 
rest of the world does not admire it as much as we 
do. The magnificent challenge of the Boers to the 
British Empire, and the stand of our own purchased 
but recalcitrant Filipino subjects, show that our 
civilization of industrialism and commercialism is 
not satisfactory or desirable to those peoples. Our 
civilization of industrialism and commercialism will 
probably prevail over them. It may prevail over 
the whole of the world. But the end of its empire 
is ennui such ennui as fell upon the Romans 
when the few ideals of that prosaic race faded and 
they were left with nothing but their conquests and 
their riches. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



AMERICAN AND ENGLISH POETS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the current issue of THE DIAL the article based on 
Mr. Stedman's " American Anthology " evidences such 
sane appreciation of the highest value of poetry, and 
such true critical insight, that it seems worth while to 
call attention to a statement that should not be allowed 
to go unchallenged. " The twelve greatest English 
poets," the reviewer says, in dwelling on the last hun- 
dred years of poetical activity, " are Keats, Shelley, 
Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Landor, Tennyson, 
Browning, Arnold, Rossetti, Morris, and Mr. Swin- 
burne. The best dozen of our American poets are 
probably Bryant, Emerson, Holmes, Longfellow, Lowell, 
Poe, Whitman, Whittier, Lanier, Taylor, Mr. Aldrich, 
and Mr. Stedman. There is obviously little room for 
comparison between the two groups. From the stand- 
point of disinterested criticism it is hardly too much to 
say that in absolute value every one of the English 
group outweighs the best of the American. It would 
require an excess of patriotic zeal to dispute a conclu- 
sion so obvious to the impartial observer." 

This is very positive language, but it is not convincing. 
That our best poets, taken as a class, cannot be com- 
pared with this century's group of great Englishmen, is 
indeed undeniable. Yet on what grounds does THE 
DIAL claim a higher place for Morris than for Poe? or 
for Arnold than for Lowell? The writer makes manifest 
his appreciation of the value of the inspiring glow and 
the genial warmth to be found in the work of our poets 
who " warmed both hands before the fire of life," with- 
out being willing to give forth only the cold beauty of 
a Landor, or the narrow, passionate heat of a Swin- 
burne; he shows clearly that in his statement which I 
have quoted he is thinking of what may be called the 
" purely artistic " side of poetry. It seems difficult, in 
a question of " absolute value," to omit the worth of 
the idealistic essence with its consequent power of 
effect, its thrill of inspiration; but granting the possi- 
bility of critical appreciation that shall take into account 
only the " artistic " qualities of verse, the question still 
remains: On what grounds is Poe pronounced inferior

to Morris, or Lowell to Arnold? One might even add: 
Does not Emerson, in his highest flights of lyric rhap- 
sody, reach heights to which neither of the English 
poets whom I have mentioned ever attained? 

The reviewer in THE DIAL states that his conclusion 
is obvious to the " impartial observer." It may be that 
that rare and indefinite being, the " impartial observer," 
whom writers so willingly invoke to attest the truth of 
their statements, will agree to the suggestion that even 
a thoughtful and excellent critic is at times led into un- 
witting depreciation of his country's poets, through the 
fear (perhaps unconscious) of being misled by " patriotic 

zea l-" GEORGE S. HELLMAN. 

New York, Oct. S3, 1900. 

[We can have no quarrel with so courteous a 
critic, nor would we have any essential quarrel 
were his position more bluntly maintained. By 
selecting the least important of the twelve English 
poets for comparison with the most important of 
the twelve Americans, our case is assailed at what 
is undoubtedly its weakest point. The judgment 
in favor of the transatlantic poets was given delib- 
erately, for it is a judgment to which we have held 
for years ; but the inclination of the balance is 
slight, and in such a case the element of personal 
opinion, which we always endeavor to exclude as 
rigorously as possible, may possibly have been the 
determining factor. For the rest, in the two in- 
stances adduced by our critic the disparity in the 
volume of good work must be considered in any 
comparison of Morris with Foe ; and, in a com- 
parison of Arnold with Lowell, the purer form and 
the greater lucidity of expression that characterize 
the former poet. EDRS. THE DIAL.]

MORLEY'S AND ROOSEVELT'S CROMWELL,.* 



The monographs on Oliver Cromwell writ- 
ten for the Century and Scribner's magazines 
by Mr. John Morley and Governor Roosevelt, 
respectively, make their nearly simultaneous 
appearance in book form, with all the original 
pictures. Mr. Morley's volume forms the 
longer and more elaborate work of the two ; 
and while its magazine origin is not unappar- 
ent throughout, it also bears throughout, we 
need hardly say, the unmistakable impress of 
distinction inseparable from this fine writer's 
work. Like all Mr. Morley's essays in histor- 
ical biography (and where are better ones to 
be found ?), the life of Cromwell is a study not 
only of the man, but also, and perhaps even

more essentially, of his times and the spirit of 
his times. 

Governor Roosevelt has plainly found in 
Cromwell, as a remarkably strenuous char- 
acter who entered public life at the head of 
a corps of rough riders, a subject very much 
to his mind ; and he has treated it with his 
usual vim and downrightness, and with as 
much independence of view as a theme already 
so well canvassed admits of. Governor Roose- 
velt, while seeing in the Puritanism of Crom- 
wellian times the dawn of the new order, rather 
than the sunset of the old (the "last glimpse 
of the Godlike vanishing from this England," 
as Carlyle mournfully put it), is nevertheless 
not quite so sure nor, indeed, are we as 
some are, that Oliver himself is to be regarded 
as the shining herald and morning-star of those 
free institutions, under which we, in our more 
sanguine moments, rejoice to think we are 
living. 

Whether Cromwell personally did more to 
advance or to retard those institutions, is a 
question on both sides of which, as Sancho 
Panza used to say, " much may be said." At 
the outset he stood manfully for government 
by discussion, as opposed to personal rule ; but 
as his career advanced, and power came to 
him, grave contradictions appeared ; and as a 
ruler the one thing that can with absolute cer- 
tainty be said of him is that he had his own 
way. Any discussion, parliamentary or other, 
that happened for a moment to block that way 
was promptly thrust out of it ; and any Hamp- 
den who " with dauntless breast " withstood 
the proceeding as illegal, was, in effect, 
promptly extinguished with a gruff " Leave off 
your fooling, aud come down, sir ! " as was, in 
fact, luckless Parson Hitch in his pulpit at 
Ely. True, Cromwell beheaded a king, and 
prevented Presbyterianism from playing Laud 
in the realm on its own account ; but he also, 
without show or pretense of legality, broke up 
Parliament after Parliament, and, in order to 
get a Parliament to suit him, out-Tudored 
the Tudors by setting up one composed of his 
own nominees a conclave of " saints " which 
signed its own death-warrant the moment it 
manifested a disposition to act on its own 
initiative, and without the sanction of its im- 
perious creator ; he ground Ireland under the 
heel of a system as " Thorough " as Stratford's ; 
he hunted down Catholics because they were 
Catholics ; he trampled on Scotch Presbytery ; 
he deprived English Episcopacy of its Prayer- 
book, and thus drove half England to celebrate

THE DIAL 



299 



its cherished sacraments by stealth and in 
secret conventicles a fair reprisal under the 
lex talionis for the doings of Laud, perhaps, but 
in no wise an instance of that policy of tolera- 
tion which he professedly championed, and 
which he did in fact champion in behalf of 
such sects as held a doctrine and practiced a 
ritual which did not shade off too sharply from 
his own. Presbyterians, Anabaptists, Millen- 
narians, Fifth Monarchy men, sectaries of the 
wilder sorts, all found shelter under the segis 
of Oliver's qualified and scrutinizing tolerance ; 
but woe to the creed in whose ceremonial was 
to be found a taint of Popish practices the 
brand of the Scarlet Woman. 

It is customary to regard Cromwell as the 
great and triumphant foe of the theory of 
" divine right "; and such, in a sense, he was. 
But in place of the hereditary divine right of 
Charles Stuart he straightway set up the im- 
mediate divine right of Oliver Cromwell a 
notion quite as fatal to popular liberties, gov- 
ernment by discussion, taxation by consent of 
the taxables, and the rest of it, as the one it 
displaced. That he was God's chosen instru- 
ment for the purification and uplifting of 
England, and that the inward promptings of 
what he took to be the voice of God had a 
warrant infinitely superior to any popular 
mandate that might reach him through the 
medium of Parliament, was a conviction that 
grew in intensity with every victory, from 
Marston Moor to the " crowning mercy " of 
Worcester. "Now let God arise, and His 
enemies shall be scattered ! " he ejaculated 
exultingly when the sun rose like a red portent 
of slaughter over the North Sea at Dunbar ; 
and it was with the unsparing sword of the 
Lord of Hosts that he smote the Papists at 
Drogheda and Wexford. To the fact that 
Cromwell's utterances, even on minor occas- 
ions, were full, and to the modern sense offen- 
sively and suspiciously so, of this radical 
conviction of his, is largely due the long sur- 
vival of the Clarendonian conception of him 
as a canting rebel and usurper masking his 
ambitious designs in a cloak of sanctity. The 
thesis that a man whose speech was full of 
Scripture, but whose deeds were full of blood 
and lawlessness, was a hypocrite, was too 
plausible a one to be easily shaken down. 
But it yielded at last to the genius and 
research of Carlyle and the sound sense and 
firm stroke of Macaulay. Nobody now doubts 
Cromwell's sincerity or his patriotism. But 
the reaction has gone far. A democratic age, 



having vindicated Oliver, must needs see in 
him not only the sincere man and patriotic 
statesman who strove unceasingly according 
to his lights for the glory of God and the good 
of his country, but the herald and originator 
of free institutions. Cromwell, who cut the 
knot of every constitutional difficulty with his 
sword, who denounced a broad suffrage as 
" tending very much to anarchy," who clapped 
in the stocks or had shot those who prated of 
equality, who treated Parliament with con- 
tumely and its august emblem as a bauble, 
whose rule, in short, represented in an extreme 
form the popular bogey personal rule, is now 
revered as the patron saint of English de- 
mocracy. 

It is quite possible that, as a recent writer 
urges, Cromwell had a theoretical preference 
for a representative form of government, and 
that had he succeeded in getting a House of 
Commons always in perfect accord with his 
views and policy he would have worked 
smoothly with it, and lived and died to all 
appearance no more than its first minister and 
mandatary. But this is hardly a safe argument 
to advance in support of Oliver's alleged lean- 
ings to popular rule and government by dis- 
cussion. To act with Parliament so long as it 
agreed with him, and to purge, pack, or dissolve 
Parliament the moment it disagreed with him, 
was as characteristic of Cromwell as it is in- 
consistent with any just notion of a parlia- 
mentary ruler. 

The fact is it is idle to try to definitely label 
and appropriate Cromwell as the champion of 
this or that ideal theory of government. He 
did not govern England according to some 
high-sailing maxims about the Rights of Man, 
but according to his own conclusions as to the 
deserts and capacities of Englishmen as he saw 
them. He was no ideologist, but a great states- 
man and soldier, who dealt with questions as 
they arose, each on its own merits, and whose 
rule fluctuated in stringency with the needs of 
the hour. Statesmanship was for him a prac- 
tical business, not a science constructed on the 
mathematical plan. He held the power, and 
he used it for the ordering and advancement 
of his country. He had, indeed, a programme, 
of a very practical sort, which he was convinced 
was the right one, and the one agreeable in the 
sight of God ; and he was determined to carry 
it out. To that end he seized autocratic power. 
It may be that in the long run his ascendency 
made for free government and freedom of re- 
ligious opinion, for he struck down much that 



300 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



stood in the way of them ; but that he kept 
this ideal in view is doubtful. That he would 
have sanctioned a government wholly purged 
of theocracy, is more than doubtful. We may 
conjecture that were a second Cromwell to ap- 
pear in our time, the national imperialism of 
the day would find in him a formidable and 
effective chieftain. But the effort to define 
and class him in the interest of some variety of 
current opinion, or even of historical precision, 
leads to endless debate and confusion. Most 
current views of him are defensible ; none is 
unchallengeable. As to the essential nature 
of the work he did, authorities differ radically. 
He destroyed, but he could not build, says 
one ; he was great as a destroyer, but how 
much greater as a builder ! says another. His 
rule, at all events, was that of the sword. Yet 
English democracy sees in him its progenitor 
and patron saint. Mr. Morley, for his part, 
has abstained from hard-and-fast generaliza- 
tions ; for, he says, 

" The thirst after broad classifications works havoc with 
truth; and to insist upon long series of unqualified clencli- 
ers in history and biography only ends in confusing ques- 
tions that are separate, in distorting perspective, in 
exaggerating proportions, and in falsifying the past for 
the sake of some spurious edification of the present." 

Mr. Morley's essay is keyed above the tone 
and spirit of controversy ; and surely the time 
has gone by for wrangling over the cause, and 
weeping or rejoicing over the fate of the Stu- 
arts. What is wanted now is the clear sight 
and the balanced judgment in order that we 
may come at last to the right historic view of 
that great drama and its actors. To this end, 
Mr. Morley's cool and dispassionate pages give 
valuable aid. The keynote of his treatment of 
the characters of the leaders on both sides is 
indicated in the following paragraph : 

" Just as the historic school has come to an end that 
despatched Oliver Cromwell as a hypocrite, so we are 
escaping from the other school that dismissed Charles 
as a tyrant, Laud as a driveller and a bigot, and Went- 
worth as an apostate." 

Mr. Morley goes on to say : 

" That Wentworth passed over from the popular to 
the royalist side, and that by the same act he improved 
his fortunes and exalted his influence, is true. But there 
is no good reason to condemn him of shifting the found- 
ation of his views of national policy. He was never a 
Puritan, and never a partisan of the supremacy of Par- 
liament. By temperament and conviction he was a firm 
believer in organized authority. . . . Wentworth's ideal 
was centered in a strong state, exerting power for the 
common good ; and the mainspring of a strong state 
must be a monarch, not Parliament. . . . That he as- 
sociated the elevation of his own personality with the 
triumph of what he took for the right cause, is a weak- 
ness, if weakness it be, that he shares with some of the 



most upright reformers that have ever lived. It is a 
chaste ambition if rightly placed, he said at his trial, 
to have as much power as may be, that there may be 
power to do the more good in the place where a man 
lives. . . . He was devoted to friends, never weary of 
taking pains for them, thinking nothing too dear for 
them. If he was extremely choleric and impatient, yet 
it was in a large and imperious way. He had energy, 
baldness,* unsparing industry and attention, long-sigh ted 
continuity of thought and plan, lofty flight, and as true 
a concern for order and the public service as Pym or 
Oliver or any of them." 

Of Charles's desertion of this faithful ser- 
vant in his hour of mortal danger, Mr. Morley 
says: "Time has stamped the abandonment 
of Strafford with an ignominy that cannot be 
washed out." As to Carlyle's dictum that the 
act of the English regicides " did in effect 
strike a damp-like death through the heart of 
Flunkyism universally in this world," Mr. 
Morley observes : 

" In fact the very contrary of Carlyle's proposition 
as to death and damp might more fairly be upheld. 
For this at least is certain, that the execution of Charles 
I. kindled and nursed for many generations a lasting 
flame of cant, flunkyism, or whatever else might be the 
right name of spurious and unmanly sentimentalism, 
more lively than is associated with any other business 
in our whole national history." 

Discussing the fate of Charles, Mr. Morley 
says in conclusion: 

" The two most sensible things to be said about the 
trial and execution of Charles I. have often been said 
before. One is that the proceeding was an act of war, 
and was just as defensible or just as assailable, and on 
the same grounds, as the war itself. The other remark 
is that the regicides treated Charles precisely as Charles, 
if he had won the game, undoubtedly promised himself 
with law or without law that he would treat them. The 
author of the attempt upon the Five Members in 1642 
was not entitled to plead punctilious demurrers to the 
revolutionary jurisdiction. From the first it had been 
My head or thy head, and Charles had lost." 

Robespierre, in a rare moment of hard prac- 
tical insight, at once defined and vindicated in 
a sentence the execution of Louis XVI. It 
was, he said, "an act of political necessity"; 
and we know of no better apology than that 
for the course of the earlier regicides who con- 
trolled or composed Bradshaw's motley trib- 
unal. " Stone-dead hath no fellow," said Essex, 
in reply to the proposals for merely banishing 
Strafford ; and as it was plain to all that there 
could be no peace for England until Charles 
was got rid of, it was perhaps for the best that 
he was got rid of completely and beyond hope 
of recall. 

Governor Roosevelt's book is a good, plain 
narrative, stripped of confusing details, of 
Cromwell's career. Much space is given to

military matters, and the political side of the 
subject is dealt with far more fully than the 
religious side. A striking peculiarity through- 
out is the frequency of allusion to compara- 
tively modern names and topics of current or 
recent interest. We think it regrettable that 
Governor Roosevelt has seen fit to interpolate 
in his narrative occasional rather spiteful 
flings at stock objects of his dislike that 
unfortunate " cloistered type" of his fellow cit- 
izens, for example, to which he has elsewhere 
so frequently and forcibly paid his compliments. 
There are in every civilized community men of 
quiet tastes, who prefer to do what good they 
can in a quiet and inconspicuous way; and it 
is hardly fair to berate them for leaving to 
others a field for which they feel themselves 
unfitted. The student of public affairs, or the 
" closet philosopher," to use Governor Roose- 
velt's epithet, may very conceivably serve his 
country hardly less effectively than the actual 
participant in them.

THE BEGINNINGS OF A GREAT SCHOOL,.* 

There may be differences of opinion as to 
the ideal upon which Mr. Thomas Harrison 
Montgomery has constructed his " History of 
the University of Pennsylvania." It would be 
strange, for example, if some readers did not 
think that he might better have omittedsome 
of the material that he has introduced, as, for 
instance, in his frequent biographical sketches. 
It is hard to see that Franklin's electrical re- 
searches need to be recounted, even in brief, 
in such a work. But there can be no such 
differences as to the painstaking and laborious 
conscientiousness with which Mr. Montgomery 
has done his work. None can dispute that, his 
plan once formed, he has prosecuted it with 
great zeal, intelligence, and success. The book 
abounds in detail, the style of composition 
tends to the ponderous, and the narrative is so 
heavily weighted with quotations from docu- 
ments that no one who tries to read it will 
think the book easy reading. It is to a con- 
siderable extent a collection of original mate- 
rials. Still, the style is not ill adapted to the 
matter, and the student of our educational

history will welcome the volume as a substan- 
tial contribution to our educational literature. 

The institution that was first known as the 
Public Academy of the City of Philadelphia, 
but is now called the University of Pennsylva- 
nia, was the greatest of the gifts that Benjamin 
Franklin made to the city and state of his 
adoption. It had its origin in certain "Pro- 
posals Relating to the Education of Youth in 
Pensilvania, Philadelphia," that he printed in 
his "Pennsylvania Gazette," August 24, 1749. 
That the time for such a movement was ripe 
was shown by the ready reception that these 
" Proposals " met with, and the immediate 
steps that were taken to embody them in ac- 
tion. As a place of instruction, the Academy 
opened its doors on the first Monday of Jan- 
uary, 1750. The funds came at first from 
private subscriptions and the municipal gov- 
ernment, principally the former ; but after- 
wards material assistance was received from 
collections made in England. The great finan- 
cial reliance, however, for the period here cov- 
ered was tuition fees paid by students. And 
still there was a charity school in connection 
with the Academy, an inheritance that came to 
the Board of Trustees along with the property 
on which their school was first established, and 
that constituted a legacy from Whitfield's 
evangelistic labors in Philadelphia. In 1756 
a college organization was added to the Acad- 
emy, and nine years later the Medical School, 
the first one in the country, was founded. Few 
educational words have a fixed connotation, 
but the author has some reason on his side 
when he says that the commencement of 1771 
is memorable "in witnessing the first public 
claim by the Provost for the institution of the 
rank and place of a University, to which in 
fact it had attained in 1768, and which it 
has maintained with honor through varying 
changes and vicissitudes to the present time." 
June 21 of that year is the date of the first 
medical commencement. 

In the order of time, Philadelphia was the 
sixth of the nine colleges founded in the Thir- 
teen Colonies before the Revolutionary War. 
It was marked off from those that preceded 
and those that succeeded it by characters that 
were peculiarly its own and gave it a special 
interest as a feature of our collegiate history. 
Three such marks may be noted. 

For one thing, Philadelphia was wholly free 
from direct ecclesiastical control. It bore, of 
course, the theological marks that belonged to 
all Christian schools a century and a half ago, 



302 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



but it was in no sense subject to church dom- 
ination. The Board of Trustees and Faculty 
were meeting-places for the leading denomina- 
tions of the city ; but for some reason, which 
Mr. Montgomery might have explained more 
fully, the Episcopalians were more numerous 
than any other, especially in the Board. As 
Franklin wrote at the time to a correspondent, 
who was himself an Episcopalian clergyman, 
" The Trustees of the Academy are three- 
fourths of them members of the Church of 
England, and the rest men of moderate prin- 
ciples." Still, the property on which the school 
was first established, for historical reasons, 
carried a creed in the title-deed : 

" We do also give our assent to the 9th, 10th, llth, 
12th, 13th, and 17th articles of the Church of England, 
as explained by the Calvinists in their Literal and 
grammatical sence without any equivocation whatso- 
ever. We mention these in particular because they are a 
summary of the foregoing articles. We believe all that 
are sound in faith agree in these whatever other points 
they may differ in." 

Here it may not be amiss to remark that two 
questions which the History of Pennsylvania 
suggest have never, to our knowledge, been 
satisfactorily resolved. One is the powerful 
hold that the Church of England early got in 
the colony, and particularly in Philadelphia, 
and the other the extraordinary ease and 
smoothness with which Friends passed into 
that communion. In view of the origin of the 
colony, and especially in view of what the 
Friends had suffered from the Establishment 
in England, both of these facts seem surpris- 
ing. There can, however, be no doubt that 
the leading members of that communion, rein- 
forced by the one-fourth of " men of moderate 
principles " of whom Franklin was easily the 
first, were the fittest managers of the new 
school that the colony could furnish. The 
Quakers, for example, were at the time wholly 
incompetent to found or to take the oversight 
of a school of liberal learning. 

The second mark of the new institution was 
an outgrowth of the first one. It was less 
ecclesiastical and more secular than any other 
anti-revolutionary college. In a paper laid 
before the Common Council in 1750, Franklin 
thus stated the benefits that were expected to 
flow from the establishment of the school : 

"The Benefits expected from this Institution are: 
That the youth of Pennsylvania may have an opportu- 
nity of receiving a good Education at home, and be 
under no necessity of going abroad for it. ... That a 
Number of Natives will hereby be qualified to be our 
Magistracies, and execute other public offices of Trust, 
with Reputation to themselves and Country ; there being 



at present great want of Persons so qualified in the 
several counties of this Province. And this is the more 
necessary now to be provided for by the English here, 
as vast numbers of Foreigners are yearly imported 
among us, totally ignorant of our Laws, Customs and 
Language. That a Number of the poorer Sort will 
hereby be qualified to act as Schoolmasters in the 
County, to teach Children Reading, Writing, Arith- 
metic, and the Grammar of their Mother Tongue; . . . 
the County suffering at present very much for want of 
good School masters. ... It is thought that a good 
Academy erected in Philadelphia, a healthy place where 
Provisions are plenty, situated in the Center of the Col- 
onies, may draw Numbers of Students from the neigh- 
boring Provinces, who must spend considerable Sums 
yearly among us, in Payment for their Lodging, Diet, 
Apparel, &c." 

Nothing could well be more secular and prac- 
tical than this. Every word shows the influence 
of the author's mind. Franklin was indeed of 
Puritan blood, but this is not Puritan language 
or the Puritan conception of a school of higher 
learning. To be more definite, while many of the 
students of the Academy and College became 
ministers of the Gospel, the preparation of young 
men for that calling does not appear to have been 
a conscious purpose of those who founded it. 

The third point is the very modern character 
of the institution. No doubt this feature is 
closely connected with those already mentioned, 
but it deserves separate notice. The early 
documents lay stress upon the modern lan- 
guages, and especially the English language. 
The " constitutions " of 1749 describe the 
Academy as a school " for teaching the Latin 
and Greek languages, the English tongue gram- 
matically, and as a language, the most useful 
living foreign languages, French, German, and 
Spanish, etc." The Trustees were commanded 
with " all convenient speed to endeavor to en- 
gage persons capable of teaching the French, 
Spanish, and German languages," as well as 
other branches of learning. Franklin had ideas 
as to the way in which English should be taught, 
ideas that grew out of his own instructive ex- 
perience. He wrote in his " Proposals ": 

" The English Language might be taught by Gram- 
mar, in which some of our best Writers, as Tillotson, 
Addison, Pope, Algernon Sidney, Cato's Letters, &c., 
should be classicks : The Stiles principally to be culti- 
vated, being the clear and the concise. Reading should 
also be taught, and pronouncing, properly, distinctly, 
emphatically ; not with an even Tone, which under- 
does, nor a theatrical, which over-does Nature. 

" To form their Stile, they should be put on Writing 
Letters to each other, making Abstracts of what they 
read ; or writing the same Things in their own Words ; 
telling or writing Stories lately read, in their own Ex- 
pressions. All to be revised and corrected by the 
Tutor, who should give his Reasons, explain the Tone 
and Import of Words, &c.

" To form their Pronunciation, they may be put on 
making Declamations, repeating Speeches, delivering 
Orations, &c. The Tutors assisting at the Rehearsals, 
teaching, advising, correcting their Accent, &c." 

How far this was in advance of the times is 
well known to students of our colonial educa- 
tional history. Franklin was no doubt the 
only man in the country at the time who could 
have conceived such a programme. Indeed, 
the programme was too advanced even for 
Philadelphia ; and the failure to realize it, 
especially in respect to English teaching, was 
one of the griefs of Franklin's old age. 

In 1756, Dr. Smith, the Provost, brought 
out, in connection with the organization of the 
College, the scheme or plan of education that 
was to be furnished in the schools comprising 
the College and Academy together. Our au- 
thor finds the source of this excellent formula 
in the curriculum of King's College, Aberdeen, 
where Provost Smith had been trained a decade 
before. " But whencever its origin or concep- 
tion," he says, " it is the first complete curricu- 
lum for a college training which any American 
colony had yet witnessed or recognized, and 
will stand for all time as the forerunner in all 
advanced education on these shores." He de- 
clares also that it was "unequalled in any 
institution in this western country for its com- 
prehensiveness and thoroughness." Those who 
hold briefs for some of the older colleges may 
possibly dispute this claim. A nicer point, 
however, is the extent to which Smith's scheme 
was actually carried out. One who reads the 
document, which Mr. Montgomery prints in 
full, is puzzled to see how a faculty so small as 
that at Philadelphia could have taught all the 
subjects that the scheme embraced ; and the 
sceptical will probably think that in some parts 
this course of study existed merely on paper. 

Students of educational history will regret 
that in closing this work the author lays down 
his pen not expecting to resume it, and also 
will join with him in the hope that another 
author " may carry on the history of this Uni- 
versity family, illustrating its varying misfor- 
tunes during the Revolutionary struggle, its 
quiet life through the first seventy years of this 
century, and portraying with loving strokes its 
enlarged and influential work of the present 
generation under the strong stimulus of which 
it is prepared to enter upon its great career in 
the twentieth century." It is to be hoped, how- 
ever, that Mr. Montgomery's successor will di- 
vide his book into regular chapters with appro- 
priate headings, and that he will also furnish 
a table of contents. B. A. HINSDALE. 



GIRLHOOD MEMORIES OF MADAME 
ROLAND.* 

The French Revolution, among its other 
surprises, conferred immortality on a host of 
rather commonplace men and women, headed 
by Louis XVI. Of these it might be said that 
"nothing in their life became them like the 
leaving it." Dragged into the fierce light that 
beat about the scaffold, they were converted from 
advocates, physicians, or provincial abbes, into 
heroes, patriots, martyrs, of whom their world 
was not worthy. That many high qualities 
in posse were thus developed, which under 
other circumstances might have won for their 
possessors a respectable degree of eminence, is 
not questioned ; but surely it is the bitter in- 
iquity of their fate and the exalted courage 
with which they met it that have saved their 
names for the reverent admiration of the gen- 
erations. 

It is at least a\i open question whether this 
would have been true of her whom all men 
know as Madame Roland. She emerged into 
public view as the wife of the citizen Minister, 
and for a few troubled years shared and directed 
her husband's counsels. When her friends the 
Girondists succumbed to the Mountain, she 
too was arrested, on the first of June, 1793, 
and taken to the Abbaye. Released twenty- 
four days later, she was at once re-arrested and 
confined in Sainte Pelagie. Here she wrote 
her " Historical Notes " and her " Private 
Memoirs." On November first she was re- 
moved to the Conciergerie, and on the eighth 
she was " tried," sentenced, and led out to ex- 
ecution. As they bound her to the plank, her 
eyes fell on the colossal statue of Liberty, and 
she murmured, " liberte, comme on fajouee " 
(or the more popular variant, " O liberte, com- 
bien de crimes on a commis en ton nom " ). 
These are the dramatic facts of her closing 
years, and are known to everybody ; and for 
the Anglo-Saxon reader they have generally 
sufficed. 

In the beautiful little volume before us, Mr. 
Johnson has turned the page back to the girl- 
hood memories of Marie Jeanne Phlipon. The 
translation which is here reprinted in a revised 
form was made from Bosc's original edition of 
the Memoirs, and was published at London in 
1795, two years after Madame Roland's death 
by the guillotine. For many years now these 
memoirs, which form a favorite French classic,

have not been procurable in an English ver- 
sion ; it was high time, therefore, for a new 
edition. 

Nothing in these reminiscences is so im- 
pressive as the circumstances under which they 
were written. In Mr. Johnson's words, 

" The writer was a prisoner, and under no illusions 
as to her impending fate. Across her path lay in un- 
mistakable outlines the shadow of the guillotine. Her 
husband and her friends were outlaws, tracked from 
hiding-place to hiding-place by men in whose eyes 
clemency was a political crime. The trumped-up charge 
of her own infamy was ringing in the ears of all Paris. 
. . . Her day was done. Her stately Plutarchian re- 
public of wisdom and virtue was sunk in blood and 
mire." 

Thus thrown back on her own thoughts, she 
took up her pen to recount the story of her 
life ; and gradually losing herself in the visions 
of her happy tranquil youth, she described its 
events with an eager minuteness which repro- 
duced whole conversations and protracted medi- 
tations from the shadowy past. The flow of 
reminiscence is at times checked by interrup- 
tions which would seem appalling to an ordi- 
nary mind as thus : 

" September 5. I cut the sheet to inclose what I 
have written in the little box; for when I see a revolu- 
tionary army decreed, new tribunals formed for shed- 
ding innocent blood, famine threatened, and the tyrants 
at bay, I augur that they must have new victims, and 
conclude that no one is secure of living another day." 

Or this : 

" They interrupt, to inform me that I am compre- 
hended in Brissot's act of accusation, along with many 
other deputies recently arrested. The tyrants are at 
bay; they think to fill up the pit open before them, by 
precipitating worthy people into it ; but they themselves 
will fall in afterwards. ... I shall send away this 
section of my memoir, and prepare to proceed on an- 
other, if I am permitted." 

It is certainly no common young French- 
woman that looks out upon us from these pages. 
With engaging candor, and a self-consciousness 
scarce reached again in print until Marie Bash- 
kirtseff, she casts up the account of her youth- 
ful charms of person and intellect, and finds 
the sum- total " all very good ": 

" As to my face, there was nothing in it specially 
striking of itself, save perhaps the fresh color, the 
tenderness and expression. To go into details, ' Where,' 
it may be asked, is the beauty ? ' Not a feature is 
regular, but all please. The mouth is rather large 
one sees a thousand that are prettier; but where is 
there a smile more sweet and engaging ? The eye is 
scarcely large enough, and its iris is of a grayish hue; 
but, though somewhat prominently set, it is frank, 
lively, and tender, crowned by delicately penciled brown 
eyebrows (the color of my hair), and its expression 
varies with the changing emotions of the soul whose 
activity it reflects; grave and haughty, at times it im- 
poses; but it charms oftener, and is always animated." 



Far and faint indeed seems the cry from this 
student of her mirror to "Plutarch's woman," 
" the Egeria of the Girondins." 

Her father, Gatien Phlipon, an engraver 
by occupation, is described with no filial illu- 
sions : 

" Strong and healthy, active and vain, he loved his 
wife, and was fond of dress. Without learning, he had 
that degree of taste and knowledge which the fine arts 
give superficially, in whatever branch they are prac- 
tised. . . . He led a regular life, while his ambition 
was not unbridled, or had experienced no disappoint- 
ments. He could not be said to be a virtuous man, 
but he had a great deal of what is called honor." 

On the other hand, her mother's presence, 
ever gentle and sympathetic, pervades the 
whole narrative ; and we can readily realize 
the passionate devotion with which this proud 
and high-strung girl clung to the parent who 
seemed to understand her. This was her trib- 
ute to her mother's memory : 

" Thus was taken from the world one of the gentlest, 
most lovable beings that ever graced it. Her qualities 
were not brilliant, but they were such as won and re- 
tained the love of all who knew her. Naturally pure 
and just, her virtues were the fruit of impulse, not 
effort. Prudent and self-poised, tender without passion, 
her tranquil spirit lived its days as flows some quiet 
stream that laves with equal complaisance the rock 
that holds it captive and the valley it embellishes." 

The little Marie's impressible nature was 
deeply affected by her first communion ; but 
soon her faith began to disintegrate, under 
doubts as to eternal damnation and the infal- 
libility of the Church ; and she, with thousands 
of others, was left in philosophic recognition 
of a First Cause, a Supreme Intelligence, to 
whom she could address this petition, in which 
we find something more than philosophy : 

" O Thou who hast placed me on the earth, enable 
me to fill my destination in the manner most conform- 
able to Thy divine will, and most beneficial to the 
welfare of my brethren of mankind." 

As she grew to womanhood, this fair young 
bourgeoise with the dark and eloquent eyes 
was pestered by almost as many suitors as the 
discreet Penelope ; and the tracing of their 
successive advances and dismissals must have 
brought a faint smile even to those prison- 
blanched lips in Sainte Pelagic. It is with 
considerable humor that she tells how she 
managed to escape a butcher, an advocate, a 
physician, and several other dim wooers men- 
tioned only en bloc. At length, in 1779, at 
the age of twenty-five, she accepted the hand 
of M. Roland de la Platiere, who was forty- 
seven. From this time till her death her life 
was more or less a public one, and she became 
the Madame Roland of history.

Mr. Johnson has edited the book with good 
taste and literary skill. In an introduction of 
some twenty pages, he rounds out the story of 
Madame Roland's life by tracing in outline 
her public career, imprisonment, and execution ; 
and adds a well-written and impartial estimate 
of her character. He admits that she was 
" No stranger to the sentiments of her class. How 
keenly she resented the distinctions of birth that 
blocked the path and galled the pride of the educated 
and prosperous commoner of the eighteenth century, 
her memoirs too bitterly attest. To this alloy of 
jaundiced class feeling, joined to a certain native hard- 
ness and implacability of temper, must be ascribed 
what is palpably impolitic and ungenerous in the con- 
duct of Madame Roland." 

Per contra, he adds : 

" But whatever her blemishes may have been, 
Madame Roland is still the heroine of the Revolution. 
It is to her that the eye instinctively turns for a type 
and symbol of the earlier and finer characteristics of 
that movement, its quasi-religious enthusiasm, its 
broad philanthropy, its passion for liberty and social 
justice, its faith in the original goodness and ultimate 
high destiny of man." 

The book is creditably printed, and contains 
about a dozen interesting portraits ; together 
with pictures of the Abbaye, the Conciergerie, 
the parks of Meudon and Versailles, etc. The 
abiding interest of the subject and the attrac- 
tiveness with which it is presented should 
make this translation a permanently-useful 
addition to the literature of the Revolution.

THE LATEST BOOKS ON CHINA.* 



Signs point to a lack of present interest 
taken by Americans in the battles fought by 
our armies in the Orient. No one would pre- 
tend that the war in the Philippines is a pop- 
ular war, and events in China fall easily into 
the background of our attention. The real 
interests of our national life lie elsewhere, and 
the pride taken in our army and navy is pride 
in their past rather than in their present 
achievements. Probably no nation in the world, 
with the possible exception of China, is more 
desirous of being permitted to mind its own 
business than the United States. The Chinese

know little about America, and care less ; and 
this indifference is heartily reciprocated. 

Lack of common interests is the chief cause 
of this. Neither country realizes that both are 
democracies, with a strong tendency toward 
something different in the high places, de- 
mocracies with the people heavily taxed for 
the maintenance of an office-holding class which 
is usually held in contempt, and democracies 
with the teachings of the religion of the country 
at open variance with its performance. These 
common national tendencies may be traced in 
the small library of books which have been 
rushed into print to give the English-speaking 
people some much needed and highly bewilder- 
ing information concerning the Chinese people. 
It is also manifest though none of the various 
writers has taken pains to call attention to it 
that the utter lack of real comprehension of 
the yellow race by the white implies and in- 
cludes an utter lack of real comprehension of 
the white race by the yellow. A realization 
of the fact that everything which we think 
about the Chinese unfavorable to their morals 
and civilization stands for a precisely similar 
thought in the Chinese intellect in respect to 
our morals and civilization, would do marvels 
toward making the situation comprehensible 
among the Caucasians. Nor do they suffer 
one whit more by the comparison in our eyes 
than do we in theirs. 

Half the despatches from China and Europe, 
since the present fighting-peace or peaceful- 
war began, inform the American people that 
Russia has annexed, is annexing, or is about 
to annex, Manchuria. Yet Mr. Archibald R. 
Colquhoun, in his " Russia Against India," 
says that Manchuria fell into Russian hands 
long before the Boxers began using their fists. 
For the most part, his book is taken up, not 
with the menace to British influence in China 
by Russian aggression and the advancement of 
her frontier, but with the menace to the peace 
of India and so of all Europe which lies back 
of Russia's advance in central Asia. Besides 
describing the peoples now coming under the

that India is growing worse governed under 
the British bureaucracy, rather than better, 
and utters a warning accordingly. 

Mr. Robert E. Speer republishes a chapter 
or two from his larger book on " Missions and 
Politics in China " under the title " The Situ- 
ation in China," and his contribution is timely, 
if not new. He sums up the good there is in 
the Chinese character, not less than the evil,

and makes plain that the fault lies largely with 
the European governments, which treat the 
Chinese government, now as civilized and now 
as barbarian, with neither consistency nor 
justice. Europe, by placing missions and mer- 
chants on equal terms in their diplomatic deal- 
ings with Chinese officials, does incalculable 
harm to the Christian cause. Yet he states 
that much of " the spirit of our Western 
peoples ... as displayed in dealings with 
Oriental Nations from Turkey to China, is as a 
foul stench in our nostrils." The corollary of 
this would seem to be that Christendom might 
better be christianizing itself than seeking to 
christianize a people to whom its practices are 
hopelessly irreconcilable with its professions : 
Germany, for example, gobbling a province in 
China because two followers of Jesus have 
there been crowned with the palm of mar- 
tyrdom. 

" The Crisis in China" is a symposium from 
the " North American Review " put into book 
form. It contains as many authoritative state- 
ments of the different phases of the general 
subject of China as could be gathered together 
in the time permitted, all of them pertinent 
and some of them worthy of careful study. 
Mr. Colquhoun appears again, in a paper on 
the crisis, curiously frank, and certain to throw 
light on many things besides his subject. He 
shows that such a democracy as England and 
the United States possess is of little signifi- 
cance when the question of land-grabbing in 
China comes up, in spite of their land-grab- 
bing exploits when free from international 
competition. "While the rulers of Eussia, 
Germany, France, and even Belgium, have 
been heading national crusades of productive 
enterprise in China, the governments of Great 
Britain and the United States have held aloof, 
and allowed rights and claims to be established 
to their perpetual exclusion and detriment." 
This is the proof of his statement that " we 
have seen the superiority, in certain spheres 
of competition, of governments which lead 
their people, over those of people who lead 
their governments." So true is it that En- 
gland and America have been taken up into 
the high places of the earth and shown the 
kingdoms thereof. Space does not avail even 
for a specification of the articles in the book, 
but its value is manifest at the present time. 

Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman, our consul gen- 
eral at Hong Kong, has prepared a book on 
"China's Open Door." Mr. Charles Denby, 
formerly our minister to China, writes an in- 



troduction, from which may be gleaned the 
knowledge that here is almost, if not quite, 
the greatest book ever written by anyone on 
any subject. Mr. Wildman writes within his 
knowledge respecting trade and certain events 
in recent history ; but the attempt to tell too 
much within the space defeats itself. A habit 
of dogmatic assertion and utter lack of sym- 
pathy for the Chinese are serious faults run- 
ning through its pages, and the tone of the 
book is low. An index is lacking. 

In less than three hundred pages, Mr. I. C. 
Hannah undertakes to tell the " History of 
Eastern Asia" all that part of the continent,, 
that is, which is not immediately concerned in 
European history. The work deals more with 
the past than the present, and the amount of 
space covered leaves it an unsatisfactory achieve- 
ment. Yet the book contains an astonishing 
amount of information, and takes a place of its 
own as an abridgement of the more ponderous 
histories preceding it. WALLACE RICE.

" Uncanonized," by Miss Margaret Horton Potter, 
is a historical romance of the time of King John. 
The hero is a natural son of Hubert Walter, Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, driven from his knightly 
career into the monastic life by the imperious will 
of his father, who seeks his own salvation by this 
vicarious form of atonement. Having taken the 
irrevocable vows, he is faithful to them, but his 
spirit remains rebellious, and, although an external 
freedom is beyond his grasp, he asserts for himself

an intellectual freedom which impels him to reject 
the dogmatism of the official theology, and leads 
him to martyrdom in the end. Many historical 
characters besides that of the King move in these 
pages, the most conspicuous among them being the 
captive Princess Eleanor of Brittany, to whom the 
hero becomes father-confessor, friend, and unavowed 
lover. The most noteworthy feature of this work 
is found in the writer's conception of John, and in 
her view of the struggle between King and Pope 
which placed England under the Interdict, and led 
to the submission of the royal to the papal will. 
Miss Potter is not without some warrant for her 
view, although the majority of historical scholars 
still incline to the traditional opinion. That John 
was such a monster as to defile hell itself with his 
presence may perhaps be taken as the exaggeration 
of a vindictive monkish chronicler, but it is never- 
theless a little startling to have him presented to us 
as the champion of English liberties, and, on the 
other hand, to have Stephen Langton presented to 
us as the base tool of an unscrupulous foreign op- 
pressor. Miss Potter has not been content with 
the superficial preparation that most writers of his- 
torical fiction think sufficient for their purpose ; she 
has instead made a careful and minute study of 
her period, and accumulated a really remarkable 
store of information respecting the political history 
of the time, its manners and customs, and particu- 
larly the conditions of monastic life. The chief 
defect of " Uncanonized " is that this material is 
too much in evidence, for many passages of the 
book are out of place in a work of fiction, however 
admirably they would serve the purposes of an 
essay. She has got possession of the facts in great 
quantity, she has even arranged them until they 
are seen in their proper perspective, but she has not 
succeeded in rejecting those that are irrelevant to 
her design. We note this with regret, for her book 
is in many respects far superior to the run of this 
sort of fiction ; it is serious work, and deserves to 
be treated seriously. The simple truth is that the 
narrative is so clogged by extraneous matter that 
there is no freedom of motion left it. As a romance, 
it drags, and does not reach effective dramatic cli- 
maxes. If the writer could have devised a few 
striking situations, and infused more external ex- 
citement into her work, she would have made it 
one of the most remarkable romances of its kind. 
As it is, she has produced a book that commands 
respect, and that gives much promise for the future. 
What we have just said about Miss Potter's ro- 
mance may be illustrated by contrasting the work 
with such a romance as Miss Nixon's " God, the 
King, My Brother," which has precisely the element 
of action in which " Uncanonized " is deficient. 
Here is a story that we remember for a while, at 
least as a story, and yet it is thin and superficial 
in every important respect. It is not the product 
of one-tenth the thought and industrious study that 
have gone to the making of " Uncanonized "; it 
seems the merest romantic trifling when compared 



with the other book. But it does display the story- 
teller's gift, and does not constantly disappoint us 
when we approach what bids fair to be a climax. 
For the rest, it is a tale of the Court of Castile in 
the fourteenth century, the time of Pedro the Cruel 
and the Black Prince. There is a persecuted 
maiden, a Spanish villain, and two English squires 
who thwart the villain and rescue the heroine. 
There are duels and ambuscades and perilous ad- 
ventures in rapid succession, and there is not a 
trace of the true historical atmosphere. 

John Paul Jones is an excellent hero to use for 
the purposes of historical fiction, but we fear that 
Dr. Brady is in danger of working him too hard. 
" The Grip of Honor " is the third of this talented 
writer's books, and has the wholesome manliness of 
tone which distinguished its two predecessors. But 
it is so closely like them in other respects as well 
that we have read it with some sense of disappoint- 
ment. The author's vein of mingled patriotism and 
romantic sentiment seems to be a thin one, although 
the ore is genuine. The description of the fight be- 
tween the Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis is 
certainly thrilling enough to repay the reader for 
any annoyance by the way. 

The romance of the American Revolution seems 
to be in great favor at the present time, and we 
are glad that Mr. R. N. Stephens has taken a hand 
in it. His " Philip Winwood," while not a work of 
the finish or breadth of view that we find in such 
books as u Hugh Wynne " and " Richard Carvel " 
and "Janice Meredith," is nevertheless a thoroughly 
pleasing performance, graceful in diction and in 
sentiment. It is the biography of an American 
soldier written by a royalist friend, and touches 
upon the whole course of the war, although its in- 
terest is primarily domestic. 

Mr. Joseph A. Altsheler's " In Circling Camps " 
is a story of the Civil War much above the average. 
The author has shown his skill in dealing with our 
two wars with England, and it does not desert him 
when he comes down into the modern period of 
our history. From a military point of view, the 
story has for its climax the fight at Gettysburg, 
which is described in the most vivid colors. Equal 
in its way is the earlier description of the defeat, 
afterwards turned into a victory, of Shiloh. The 
private interest is supplied by a young woman for 
whose hand two officers one Federal and one 
Confederate are rivals. How the former wins 
her, and escapes with her from under the very nose 
of his enemy, is a story told with much ingenuity. 
The sympathies of the book, while turning in favor 
of the North, do not a little to make us understand 
and admire the devotion and the heroism that did 
such desperate deeds in behalf of the cause that 
was foredoomed from the outset. 

As a master of the novel in which romantic or 
sentimental incident forms the chief source of inter- 
est, Mr. Egerton Castle is probably unsurpassed by 
any of his contemporaries. And if we set aside 
Mr. Hardy and Mr. Meredith, as being obviously

hors concours, we should hesitate to designate as his 
superior any other living English writer of fiction. 
It is only a few years since this brilliant novelist 
appeared upon the horizon, and already his work 
challenges comparison with all but the best we have. 
His new novel, entitled " Consequences," although 
less romantic in setting than " The Light of Scar- 
they," is fully as interesting, and readers will be 
glad to know that it is also fully as long. The plot 
is somewhat threadbare, being that of the man who, 
becoming involved in a tangle of difficulties, finds 
a way out by means of a pretended suicide, and 
begins life over again under a new name. As is 
usually the case, the consequences of this act pur- 
sue the actor, and in the present instance prove so 
fateful that the author could have found no better 
title for his book than that one word. But Mr. 
Castle's stories, as such, are uot^articularly remark- 
able ; what is remarkable about his books is the 
charm of their diction, the richly observant mind 
which they reveal, the fine sense of relations and 
proportions which they illustrate, and the true ring 
of their sympathies. In all these respects, "Con- 
sequences" is a noteworthy novel, and, for readers 
intent upon entertainment, will prove a source of 
unalloyed pleasure. 

Those who followed the boyhood years of "Sen- 
timental Tommy " with delight in the conception 
of his character, and amusement at the inventions 
of his precocious imagination, have been awaiting 
with considerable eagerness the story of his later 
career as a famous writer. Some, impatient of the 
delay, have had resort to the last device of the des- 
perate impatient, and have been taking " Tommy 
and Grizel" on the plan of monthly instalments. 
We, having awaited the book itself, must now con- 
fess to the disappointment which it has occasioned 
us. It opens attractively enough, and for a few 
chapters seems to promise a sustention of the old 
charm ; but after awhile the writer's invention fails 
him, he resorts to more and more questionable 
expedients to keep the story going, and we are 
loath to make the statement Tommy becomes 
distinctly tiresome. We do not mourn his demise 
when the author gets through with his biography, 
and are inclined to congratulate Grizel upon having 
made a good riddance. The simple fact is that 
Tommy's imagination assumes a development that 
is positively diseased, and the balance of faculty 
that we naturally expected would come to him with 
maturity is nowise attained. Considered even as a 
child of genius he does things that are inexplicable 
upon any rational theory, and his vagaries, ceasing 
to illustrate any consistent conception of character, 
become as whimsical as those in which Mr. 
Stockton, for example, finds his account. The book 
is a melancholy illustration of the danger that lies 
in writing sequels. 

"The West End," by Mr. Percy White, is a 
novel of English society, written by one who is 
thoroughly conversant with the life of the " classes," 
but who does not take that life too seriously, and 



contrives to tell a story of real human interest. 
The narrative is in the first person, the narrator 
being a dependent relative of the wealthy parvenu 
whose family affairs provide the subject-matter. 
Installed in this household as a sort of private sec- 
retary, his shrewd intelligence makes him indispens- 
able to the several members of the family, and his 
diplomacy is successful in dealing with one critical 
situation after another. His inquisitiveness and 
double-dealing are not altogether admirable from 
the standpoint of the strictest ethics, but he keeps 
in the good graces of all concerned, and brings to a 
satisfactory issue the matters with which he is mixed 
up. The light satirical touch of the author enlivens 
many a chapter of the book, and is slightly suggestive 
of the manner of Cherbuliez. We have thought of 
" Le Secret du Prdcepteur " more than once during 
the perusal, which is no mean praise for this enter- 
taining story. 

Mr. Clive Holland's " Marcelle of the Quarter " 
is a slight story of the Pays latin and the life of 
models and studios. The charming heroine is a 
child left an orphan by the death of the model who 
gave her birth, and adopted by a rising young 
English artist. She grows up to be a beautiful 
woman, and her protector discovers that he lovea 
her otherwise than as an adopted father. The 
usual young man then appears upon the scene, and 
seeks to win her, but in this case, contrary to the 
usual pathetic tradition, she prefers to cling to her 
elderly lover, with whom she is in the end happily 
married. The story is pleasingly told, and is free 
from the impure suggestiveness we are apt to asso- 
ciate with the sort of life which it describes. 

" The Dishonor of Frank Scott," by Miss M. 
Hamilton, is a story told in so winning a fashion 
that we are half inclined to excuse the disagreeable, 
if not impossible, character of its theme. A hero 
in whom there is nothing that can possibly be ad- 
mired is a pretty serious handicap to a work of 
fiction, and it takes some art to interest us in such 
a person at all. We certainly do get interested in 
Frank Scott, although he becomes a bigamist with 
his eyes open, bringing shame and misery upon the 
two women who are attracted by his worthless per- 
son, and, were his crime any less despicable than it 
is, we might feel a certain sympathy for him. The 
writer clearly intends that we should, which consti- 
tutes the fatal blot upon her work. The scene is 
laid in British India, and shows some familiarity 
with local conditions as far as they affect the life 
of the English resident. 

The story of " My New Curate," by the Kev. 
P. A. Sheehan, has little of the ordinary interest 
of a work of fiction, but it is better worth reading 
than nine novels out of ten. There is no love-story, 
except for an episode of subordinate inportance, 
and there is nothing in the way of plot, or intrigue, 
or adventure. Just the humble annals of an Irish 
sea-coast hamlet, related by the parish priest, and 
concerned with the simple incidents of his daily 
ministrations these, and nothing more, are offered

us by this unpretentious book. Its appeal is made 
to us by force of sheer humanity, and by the grace 
of the writer's gentle and unaffected piety. Our 
sympathies are enlisted from the start, and we fol- 
low with unflagging interest the fortunes of this 
servant of God, this genial old-fashioned scholar 
and priest, as, with the aid of his impetuous and 
enthusiastic " new curate," he labors for the spirit- 
ual welfare of his flock. There is something too 
much of ceremonial and of theological disputation 
for the best interests of the book, but this we are 
willing to accept for the sake of its humor, its 
steadfast devotion to the life of the spirit, and its 
human characterization. It is the sort of book that 
leaves a pleasant taste, and is closed with reluctance. 
There is something of the same element of simple 
humanity, of sympathy for our humble fellow-men, 
and of the disposition to discern the soul of good 
in things evil, about "The Alabaster Box," Sir 
Walter Besant's latest novel. Here we have for 
our scene, not an Irish parish, but a London slum, 
and for a theme the work of one of those philan- 
thropic settlements that have already done so much 
toward pointing the way for an effective social re- 
form. The title of the story is symbolical of the 
devotion that is satisfied with nothing less than the 
gift of self not merely of one's time or means 
to the cause of suffering humanity. Nothing can 
be too precious for that sacrifice, any more than the 
scriptural box of ointment was too precious for its 
predestined purpose. This simple story, which is 
like the one previously mentioned in its entire lack 
of the elements from which ordinary fiction derives 
its interest, is concerned wholly with the determi- 
nation of a young man, the heir of an ill-gotten 
fortune, to atone for the wrongs by which that for- 
tune had been amassed, and restore to society what 
bad been wrested from it by the cunning and harsh 
practices of his father. There is no touch of 
maudlin sentimentality about the treatment of this 
theme ; the problem is dealt with in a manly and 
courageous fashion, and the outcome is ethically 
satisfactory. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



It is perhaps not unusual for a man 

iSt0ry of letters to be tempted from his 
accustomed domain into historical 
writing. Like Carlyle, Macaulay, and many others, 
Mr. Andrew Lang has shown his versatility in a 
new light by bringing out a volume of serious his- 
tory. The first volume of his " History of Scot- 
land " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) has not the excuse of 
passionate inspiration which explained Carlyle's 
account of the French Revolution ; neither is it, 
nor is it intended to be, the masterpiece of literary 
history which Macaulay's laborious effort resulted 
in. The raison d'etre can only be found in Mr. 
Lang's love for his home people, and his interest in 



their romantic past. The volume is nevertheless 
history in its best sense, written with all the sym- 
pathy of an enthusiast, with all the thoroughness of 
a scholar, and with the truthful impartiality of the 
historian. Indeed, while the book bears evidence 
of careful investigation into ancient documents and 
manuscripts, the reader's most lasting impression is 
of Mr. Lang's desire to be absolutely fair and just 
in his conclusions. Of course there are many times 
when the historian's careful examination shatters 
some ideal of Scottish romance, yet with apparent 
unwillingness and regret. The truth will out, how- 
ever, as when the author finds himself compelled 
to state the barbarities of Wallace, or the many 
treacheries of Robert Bruce in his earlier days. 
The book is by no means easy reading. This does 
not arise from any mustiness of ideas or of facts, 
but rather because of the multiplicity of details in- 
corporated into the history. Yet as one reads on 
and becomes accustomed to the method pursued, 
this difficulty gradually disappears. In spite of the 
detailed method of statement, there has been created 
for the Scottish people, and for each period, an 
atmosphere in which men and events are seen with 
true and clear vision. This is the best feature of 
the book, and one attempted by most historians 
only in the form of separate and didactic statement. 
Here it is not stated at all, but it is woven, with fine 
technique, into the web of story. Details soon pass 
from the memory ; but a knowledge of the temper 
and characteristics of the Scottish people will re- 
main to all readers of this history. Volume I. 
covers the period from the Roman occupation to 
the murder of Cardinal Beaton.

historic past. Wealth and power, and the prestige 
that belong to them, we have beyond dispute. We 
like, also, to think that we have a remote heroic 
age peculiarly our own and the source of our na- 
tional traits and virtues. So, somewhat to the 
amusement of an old world, with its hoary tradi- 
tions of feudal and mediaeval times when even 
royalty was an innovator, we point proudly to the 
day before yesterday as to our golden antiquity, 
among the relics and muniments of which antiqua- 
rians and geologists may delve. The researches of 
genealogy have, in particular, been richly rewarded 
of late ; and the American of English descent, and 
with a liking for " blood," who cannot boast of a 
colonial or Revolutionary ancestor or two is poor 
indeed. Carping foreigners and satirical citizens 
at home make merry over our new aristocracy of 
birth, and meanly point out, among other things, 
that the modern amended passenger list of the 
" Mayflower " would rather tax the carrying ca- 
pacity of the " Great Eastern." But we are a great 
nation, and must have all the appanages of greatness, 
a class of Eupatrids among the rest. Not a few

largely the expression, however, of the scholarly 
instinct, and are of no little real value in bringing 
to light and preserving records of bygone days 
which future historians must paint. The little vol- 
ume before us entitled "The Salt-Box House" 
(Baker & Taylor Co.), by Mrs. Jane de Forest 
Shelton, is one of these books ; and its purpose is 
to portray domestic life in a typical western New 
England town of the eighteenth century. The 
narrative is compiled largely from private papers, 
and is tinged with a tender and regretful sentiment 
for the past, which is evidently genuine. The scene 
is laid in the portion of the old Connecticut town 
of Stratford, which was once called Bipton ; and 
the family whose fortunes are chronicled and whose 
home life is painted belonged to the better class of 
the day and district. The manage of the " Salt- 
Box House " was certainly simple enough. 



An excellent 
biography of 
Paul Jones. 



A glamor of mystery has long en- 
shrouded the figure of Paul Jones. 
The sketches and biographies of him 
that have hitherto appeared, leaving much to con- 
jecture, have served to intensify rather than to 
dispel it ; and thus we have come to picture this 
intrepid and gifted free-lance of the ocean, not so 
much as a perfectly realizable and relatively mod- 
ern historical character, as a heroic half-mythical 
figure fixed on the quarter-deck of the " Ranger" 
or the " Bon Homme Richard," wrapped in the 
smoke of battle. Material enough, however, has 
always existed for an authentic and fairly circum- 
stantial life of Jones, that should leave untouched 
no essential phase of his strangely varied and roman- 
tic though somewhat brief career. But the material 
has been scattered, and much of it not easy of ac- 
cess ; and the use that has heretofore been made of 
it has been most unsatisfactory, wherever an effort 
was made, or ostensibly made, to blend the facts it 
conserved into a biographical whole. That a sat- 
isfactory life of Jones, which should remove him 
from cloud-land and show him to posterity as his 
American and European contemporaries knew him, 
awaited only the advent of a writer competent to 
undertake it, is amply proved by Mr. A. C. Buell's 
spirited work in two volumes entitled " Paul Jones, 
Founder of the American Navy " (Scribner). Mr. 
Buell has ransacked the records, private and official, 
and consulted and collated the authorities, English 
and foreign. The book is really the fruit of pains- 
taking research and extended effort ; and no student 
of our maritime history can afford to neglect it. It 
is neatly gotten, up, and contains two portraits (one 
in colors) of Jones, and a few other cuts. 



A serviceable

Russian history.

excellent reference-book if it were supplied with a 
good index. The statement of the rise of the 
Rurikovitch dynasty, from the time of the first 
Russ-Varongian invaders in 862 to the extinction of 



the house in the sixteenth century, is given with a 
true appreciation of important events, and with a 
clear method. The history of this period has evi- 
dently been studied with thoroughness in such few 
sources as are available, and other authorities have 
been freely consulted. Thus the book becomes a 
valuable addition to a working library on history, 
or, rather, it would be so were it not for the in- 
completeness of the aforementioned index. A 
masterpiece of historical writing the book is not, 
either in style, or in characterization of races and 
epochs. The style is not bad, it is merely medi- 
ocre, reminding one of the dry dust-and-bones 
writings of pedagogical historians, save only when 
the author has attempted to enliven his narrative 
by humorous comment, and then the impression 
received is decidedly unfavorable, for such witti- 
cisms only rob the writing of its dignity without 
improving its general tone in the least. That 
luminous picture of peoples and of epochs, ex- 
pected in these days from writers of general his- 
tories, is entirely lacking in Mr. Munro's book, 
unless, indeed, an exception be made in favor of 
the portrayal of Russian political disorder and tur- 
moil. This failure is, however, not the fault of the 
author, but of his subject ; for surely it would be 
difficult for the most gifted historian to evolve any 
exact and clear-cut characterizations from the 
chaotic jumble of Russian politics, rulers, and races, 
in their earlier history. The author closes his 
account just when the Russian nation begins to 
assume a definite entity, and so denies himself the 
opportunity of showing his ability in dealing with 
a period where the subject people are better known, 
and the policy of rulers is more clearly defined. 
As a whole, the "Rise of the Russian Empire " 
is a serviceable book of reference, but it is not a 
great history. _

Miss Mary Bowen. Great pains have been taken 
to supply these editions with trustworthy texts, and 
the editorial apparatus includes, in several cases 
at least, a considerable amount of special pedagog- 
ical material in the shape of questions, rhetorical

exercises, and suggestions for study. The volumes 
all have illustrations, rather elaborate introductions, 
and notes, the latter appearing at the end. The 
series seems to us an altogether admirable one, and 
augurs well for the future activity of the new firm 
of publishers. 

The law in What is variously known as medical 

its relation jurisprudence, or forensic medicine, 

to physician*. ig taught J n the law 8C hools of the 

United States by lawyers and in the medical schools 
by physicians. It was suggested, some years ago, 
that the latter institutions of learning would be bene- 
fitted in no small degree by hearing lawyers discuss 
he problems arising on the confines of law and of 
medicine as well, presenting another point of view, 
and that the one invariably held when medicine is 
called in to assist in the determination of litigation, 
whether civil or criminal. As a text-book to this 
end, in part, is to be considered "The Law in its 
Relation to Physicians " (Appleton), by Mr. Arthur 
N. Taylor, LL.B., of the New York bar. Mr. 
Taylor has embodied in a duodecimo of rather 
more than five hundred pages a mass of adjudi- 
cated cases which should serve as a complete guide 
to the medical practitioner, so far as his legal re- 
sponsibilities for his professional contact with his 
patients is concerned, with such lessons drawn from 
them as can be naturally inferred in a science so 
inexact as the law. The work covers all matters on 
both the civil and criminal sides of medical juris- 
prudence, and is enlivened by many curious and 
entertaining incidents. 

Writtenfrom ^ r ' Henry Clews's book entitled 
the Wail street "The Wall Street Point of View" 
point of view. (Silver, Burdett & Co.) is the clear- 
cut and incisive statement of the opinions on cur- 
rent questions, political, financial, and commercial, 
of a keen and prosperous man of business who has 
" succeeded in life," and is therefore pretty generally 
satisfied with things as he found them. In point 
of ideals, Mr. Clews does not, as Emerson phrased 
it, exactly "hitch his wagon to a star"; but his book 
is full of hard sense if not of high thinking. Among 
the topics treated are the Railroad Question, Trusts 
and Corporations, Panics and their Indications, 
Speculation and Business, the Cleveland Adminis- 
tration, the Masses and the Classes, the Nation's 
Credit, etc. There is a leaven of illustrative anec- 
dote throughout, and the style is easy and colloquial. 
The " business man " will find Mr. Clews's book 
pleasant and satisfying reading, and an arsenal of 
useful " points." 

Such difficult readers as feel that 
they would like to know more of 
"David Harum" than can be got 
from the popular novel of that name, may find 
their account in the little book called " The Real 
David Harum " (Baker & Taylor Co.), by Mr. 
Arthur T. Vance, who tells us all about, or quite as 
much as the most exacting reader ought to want to

know about, the original of the homespun hero of 
Mr. Westcott's widely-read novel. This original, 
we learn, was one David Hannum, a quaint village 
character of northern New York, whom a former 
neighbor describes as " an ordinary sort of an amus- 
ing cuss," a characterization which Mr. Vance's 
pages rather serve to bear out. Mr. Westcott must 
be credited with having turned a most unpromising 
subject to good account in his novel. The book is 
copiously illustrated from photographs.

Houston by Mrs. Sarah Barnwell 
Elliott, are pleasant as well as profitable little vol- 
umes in the " Beacon Biographies " series (Small, 
Maynard & Co.). Young readers particularly will 
be delighted with these crisp, vivid, and direct lit- 
tle narratives, the former of which is of especial 
value by reason of the formative impression it gives 
of a high and steadfast, if severely simple, character. 
No story of frontier adventure yields in interest 
to the true tale of the life of Sam Houston ; and 
Mrs. Elliott tells it well. Both authors seem to 
have made good use of the authorities ; and ample 
references are supplied for those who care to pursue 
the subject further in fuller and weightier works. 
Each volume has its portrait. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The library edition of the writings of Alphonse 
Daudet, for some time in course of publication by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., should now, we imagine, 
although we have lost the count, be well on the way 
toward completion. The two volumes just added to 
the set contain the three " Tarascon " novels, besides a 
collection of sketches and short' stories called " Studies 
and Landscapes." Those volumes have been translated 
by Miss Wormeley with her customary skill, and no 
slight addition to their attractiveness is made by the 
special introductory essays which Professor W. P. Trent 
contributes. The first two " Tartarin " books have a 
volume together ; the other volume contains " Port 
Tarascon " and the miscellany already noted. 

Among the latest issues in the " Temple Classics " 
(Dent-Macmillan), chief interest attaches to the first 
volume in what will eventually form a complete English 
translation of the old thirteenth- century allegory of 
" The Romance of the Rose." The translator who has 
undertaken this formidable task is Mr. F. S. Ellis, 
whose previous work in the same field will be gratefully 
remembered. The inclusion of this important literary 
undertaking in such a series as the " Temple Classics " 
reflects, no little credit on the enterprise of the publish- 
ers. Other recent volumes in the same series include 
"Tully's Offices," in the English of Roger L'Estrange; 
" Areopagitica, and Other Tracts," by John Milton ; 
Vols. III. to V. in the ten-volume edition of Caxton's 
version of "The Golden Legend"; the first of five vol- 
umes containing the Essays of Lord Macaulay; and 
William Hazlitt's " Essays on the English Comic Wri- 
ters." The last-named volume has the additional recom- 
mendation of Mr. Austin Dobson's editorial supervision.

NOTES. 



A "Grammar School Arithmetic," by Mr. A. R. 
Hornbrook, has just been published by the American 
Book Co. 

" A Christmas Sermon," by Robert Louis Stevenson, 
is a charming booklet publication of Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish "The Foundations of 
French," a text-book by Messrs. Fred D. Aldrich and 
Irving L. Foster. 

Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. send us " A Beginner's 
Book in Latin," the work of Messrs Hiram Tuell and 
Harold North Fowler. 

" Elizabeth and her German Garden " reappears 
once again, in a new edition with added matter, from 
the press of the Macmillan Co. 

" An Indian Giver " and " The Smoking Car " are 
two farces by Mr. W. D. Howells, now published in 
booklet form by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" The Spanish Verb, with an Introduction on Spanish 
Pronunciation," by Lieutenant Peter E. Traub, is a 
recent educational publication of the American Book Co. 

" A New English Grammar for Schools," by Mr. 
Thomas W. Harvey, is a revision of the author's earlier 
work upon the subject, and is published by the Amer- 
ican Book Co. 

Mr. G. R. Carpenter's " Elements of Rhetoric and 
English Composition," published by the Macmillan Co., 
is offered as " second high school course " supplemen- 
tary to the one offered in a previous volume by the 
same author. 

Mr. Frederic Harrison's " The Meaning of History 
and Other Historical Pieces," which is one of the most 
interesting volumes of essays that late years have pro- 
duced, is now republished by the Messrs. Macmillan in 
a new edition at a lowered price. 

Thackeray's "English Humourists," edited with 
much interesting apparatus by Professor W. L. Phelps, 
is the newest volume in the series of " English Read- 
ings " which have been in course of publication by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. for several years past. 

" The Storied West Indies," by Mr. Frederick A. 
Ober, is a volume in the series of " Appletons' Home 
Reading Books," and exemplifies once more the skill 
and judgment which have gone into the making of that 
exceptionally commendable series of school publications. 

Scott's " Ivanhoe," edited by Mr. A. M. Hitchcock ; 
Carlyle's essay on Burns, edited by Mr. Willard C. 
Gore ; and Macaulay's essay on Warren Hastings, 
edited by Mrs. Margaret J. Frick, are three new 
volumes in the " Pocket English Classics " of the 
Macmillan Co. 

Sir W. M. Conway's " The Alps from End to End," 
and Major L. A. Waddell's " Among the Himalayas," 
are two of the most important works of travel published 
of late years, and both now reappear in new and cheap- 
ened editions from the press of the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
They are abundantly and beautifully illustrated. 

Nothing is more gratifying to those actively interested 
in the teaching of history than the recent multiplication 
of books and pamphlets containing source-material in 
easily accessible form. The latest publication of this 
description is the " Source-Book of English History " 
(Holt) prepared by Dr. Guy Carleton Lee. It is a 
thick volume of six hundred pages, containing extracts 



which cover the whole course of English history, even 
including the war in South Africa. Documentary and 
descriptive or narrative material are provided in about 
equal parts, and a valuable bibliography greatly en- 
hances the usefulness of the work. 

The Jewish Publication Society of America, encour- 
aged by the success of the " American Jewish Year 
Book," published last year, have issued a second vol- 
ume for the year just ended, and expect to make the 
publication a regular annual undertaking. The work 
is greatly increased in size and consequently in useful- 
ness for reference. 

The Valois romances of Alexandre Dumas have been 
republished in a three-volume set by Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. They include " La Reine Margot," 
" La Dame de Monsoreau," and " Les Quarante-Cinq," 
and have been newly translated with much care. A 
series of full-page original illustrations adds greatly to 
the attractiveness of this edition. 

Dr. Lyman C. Newell's " Experimental Chemistry " 
(Heath) is essentially a laboratory manual for students 
in secondary schools, and shows evidence of great care 
and thoroughness in its compilation. The fact that the 
entire work has been read for suggestions and correc- 
tions by nearly a score of the most competent teachers 
of the subject, should commend the work to favorable 
consideration. 

The " Cambridge " single-volume editions of English 
and American poets, which Mr. H. E. Scudder has been 
editing so acceptably, seem to have justified their ex- 
istence from the publishers' point of view, since every 
year brings a new volume to the series. Mrs. Brown- 
ing is the poet now presented, with the accompaniment 
of a graceful introductory essay, and a few pages of 
useful notes. 

Two " Temple Primers," in addition to those pre- 
viously noticed by us, are " The Human Frame and the 
Laws of Health," by Drs. Rebinann and Seller ; and 
" Judgment in Literature," by Mr. W. Basil Worsfold. 
They are published by the Macmillan Co. The same 
publishers send us a new edition, in a single volume, of 
the " Letters of Matthew Arnold," edited by Mr. 
George W. E. Russell. 

" Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene for High 
Schools," by Dr. Henry F. Howes, has been published 
by the American Book Co., and " A General Physiology 
for High Schools," by Messrs. M. L. Macy and H. W. 
Norris, by the same firm. There is the usual exagger- 
ated stress upon alcohol and tobacco, although the 
treatment of these subjects is not quite so offensive to 
the scientific mind as is frequently the case in books of 
this sort. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. are the American 
agents for the new " Monthly Review," edited by Mr. 
Henry Newbolt, and published by Mr. John Murray. 
The first number has just appeared, and its contents, 
which are at least upon the level of the best of its fellow- 
monthlies, bespeak the favorable consideration of the 
most intelligent class of readers. An editorial section 
affords a novelty, and Mr. Newbolt's poem represents 
a feature which we trust will be continued. In appear- 
ance, the new review distances all its rivals. Its dig- 
nity and beauty of type, page, and cover, place the 
periodical in a class of its own, and set a standard which 
others would do well to imitate. Finally, we mention 
the fact that there are illustrations which really illus- 
trate.

In the Grammars now in use the reading exercises are not arranged 
in such a way that the teacher can develop the lesson by conversation 
and questioning ; in the conversational books and readers a logical 
development of grammatical rules, as well as exercises for translation 
referring to these rules, are lacking. The purpose of this book is to 
unite both. Copies sent for examination.

Three Splendid Stories for Home Reading. 

Sold to Sunday Schools at one-third discount. 

QINSEY KREIDER. 

By HULDAH HERBICK. Illustrations by CHARLES COPE- 
LAND. Pp. 452. Cloth, $1.50. 

Dr. A. E. DUNNING, in the Congregationalist, says of this book : 
" The atmosphere of the mountains, with their rude beauty and gran- 
deur, the homely humanness of the characters, and the rapid movement 
of the story in its skilful mingling of comedy and tragedy absorb the 
reader's attention from the start, and he surrenders to the claims on 
his interest and sympathy. The revival, the schoolhouse scene, the 
hut with the still in Grimgory Gulch are boldly drawn life pictures. 
Ginsey's tragic story is a delicate and masterly piece of work. The 
religious ideas distorted by ignorance, the rude notions of justice with- 
out law, the ancestral feuds, and the struggling aspirations of the 
mountain boys and girls as they appear in this story are true to life. 
They vividly recall to us scenes which have passed before our eyes. We 
do not recall any novel whose scenes are laid among these remarkable 
people which more faithfully and attractively represents them than 
this one. It throbs with controlled sympathy. Its pathos is relieved 
by humor and hope. It has the well-blended elements of a wholesome 
and powerful story." 

KINKAID VENTURE, THE. 

By KATE W. HAMILTON. Pp. 293. 81.25. 
The story of a family of orphans, and how they made place and home 
for themselves in a pioneer town. The obstacles they overcame, the 
sturdy energy they showed, and the kindliness of their lives, blend 
into a very attractive whole. It is a good temperance story. 

THREE COLONIAL MAIDS. 

By JULIA McNAiK WRIGHT. Pp. 291. $1.25. 
The heroines of this story are New England girls, and the author 
has presented a lively picture of the Revolutionary War from the 
standpoint of the women who stay at home. The reading will stir 
anew our admiration for our patriotic foremothers, the women who 
were behind " the men behind the guns," that won our independence. 
Deborah Sampson, the woman soldier, is one of the characters. 



For Pastors, Students, and College Men. 

Twenty-Jive per cent, discount to Ministers. 

POPULAR MISCONCEPTIONS AS TO 

CHRISTIAN FAITH AND LIFE. 

By Rev. FRANK T. LEE. Pp. 261. $1.25. 

In this book an experienced pastor sets forth the true views of 
Christian faith and life over against prevailing popular misunderstand- 
ings. The volume is characterized by a luminous Christian common 
sense and breadth of view which must make it valuable to many 
readers. 

Prof. Geo. P. Fisher highly commends this book. 

THE SUPREME LEADER. 

By FRANCIS B. DENIO, D.D., Professor in Bangor Theolog- 
ical Seminary. Pp. 255. $1.25. 
The summary of a fifteen years' study of the doctrine of the Holy 

Spirit in his work for the world and the church. A most valuable guide 

and help to the study of an important side of God's revelation. 

The Outlook recently referred to this editorially as the best modern 

work on this subject. 

The Observer calls it one of the most important theological books of 

the year. 

WORK AND PLAY. 

By JOHN E. BRADLEY, Ph.D., LL.D., former President of 

Illinois College. Pp. 208. $1.00. 

Among the markedly successful features of Dr. Bradley's educa- 
tional work was his series of friendly talks to the students. Twelve of 
these talks, carefully revised, are contained in this beautiful volume. 
The book is full of attractively presented practical points for all young 
men, especially for college students. 

College Presidents are writing us most commendatory letters regard- 
ing this book.

The "AUVista" 
Panoramic 
Camera 

Has accomplished the feat of covering in a single expos- 
ure a scope of about 180 degrees. When you consider 
that this is one-half of the horizon exposed from any 
given location, the surprising nature of the accom- 
plishment is realized. Two streets running at right 
angles can now be photographed successfully at one 
exposure and other equally difficult feats are possible. 
For photographing broad landscapes, mountain ranges, 
marine views, yacht races, field sports of all kinds 
in fact, any view spreading over a large area the 
" Al-Vista " does what no other camera ever did or 
can do. 

Another surprising feature is, that pictures of vary- 
ing lengths can be made with one camera and on the

FREDERICK W. HAYES' 

Remarkable Historical Novel 

"A KENT SQUIRE" 

Being a record of certain Adventures of Ambrose 
Gwynett, Esquire, of Thornhaugh. 

Illustrated with sixteen full-page drawings by the 
author. Size, 7x5J. Long primer type, 537 pages. 
Extra paper. Beautifully printed. Exquisite cover 



design. 



Price, $1.50. 



New York Times (April 7) : "A well-illustrated book is always 
a delight." 

The Bookman : " A book to be read and hugely enjoyed." 

Mall and Express : " Mr. Hayes's book is essentially a novel of 
adventure by land and sea, and a good one." 

The Dally Telegraph : " The book possesses merit of the very 
highest order." 

Newark Daily Advertiser: "It is the best book we have seen 
in respect to cover, contents, and cuts." 

Burlington Free Press : " Combines with a powerful love story 
to make the reader unwilling to stop reading till the last page has been 
reached." 

Minneapolis Times: "Well worth reading." 

The Liverpool Mercury: "Not a dull page in the book." 

The World : " This fascinating romance." 

Ladies' Pictorial: " As fascinating in its way as Dumas's 'Three 
Musketeers.'" 

The Dial : " Mr. Hayes is a new writer to us, but he deserves well 
of the novel-reading public. French and Spanish political intrigue, as 
well as English, make up a large part of the historical substance of 
this highly exciting narrative." 

Anna Katharine Green: "'A Kent Squire' is worthy of any 
favor it may receive. The author strikes me as being a remarkable 
man." 

A WOMAN'S BOOK. 

SOUTHERN HEARTS. 

By FLORENCE HULL WINTERBURN. 

Size, 7%x5% inches. Small pica type. 466 pages. Extra 

paper. Beautiful cover design. Extra cloth. Price, $1.25. 

There is excellent reason why Florence Hull Winterburn's new 
book, " Southern Hearts," should be a favorite with women. Equally 
good reason why men should not care for it. The author has drawn 
her characters with vivid, graphic touch to the life. A brighter, 
pleasanter collection of stories for Summer reading there cannot be. 

Globe- Democrat (St. Louis, Mo.): "The author has portrayed 
with strength and delicacy the many phases of character she has intro- 
duced into her stories, and has shown rare insight in her delineations." 

Toledo Dally News : " They are far better than the average short 
story, so much better that it is a long way from a good comparison ; in 
fact, it is almost sacrilege. But one must read them. The book is 
certainly one that the author and publisher may well be proud of."

romances that has ever appeared over the

Madame Roland's attractive personality, her bril-

ration by posterity, her enthusiastic devotion to 
republicanism, her dissap- 
pointment on seeing the deeds 
done by the French Revolu- 
tionists in the name of Lib- 
erty, and her condemnation to 
the guillotine, are here set 
forth in her own words in the 
form of personal reminis- 
cences. The inherent interest 
of the work is enhanced by 
the editor's careful introduc- 
tion, which explains ade- 
quately the circumstances of 
the memoirs.

THREE IMPORTANT BOOKS 



Sons of the Morning 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS, 

Author of "CHILDREN OF THE MlST." 

8vo, $1.50. 

"'Sons of the Morning' is natural and idyllic, 
abounding in outdoor enjoyments, the bustle of healthy 
natures, most of whom are so vital that they are 
unforgettable. There is a literary charm in all 
this, and a felicity of description which is rather felt 
than evident in any specimen that might be quoted. 
It is not 'word painting,' but Nature itself." 
Richard Henry Stoddard in the New York Mail and 
Express. 

" The author has a keen sense of humor, and 
his country people are interesting and amusing, 
with their superstitions, their pertinent remarks and 
their quaint philosophy. His story is eminently 
readable." Chicago Evening Post. 

" Here we have not only literature, but we have 
character drawing, humor, and descriptive pow- 
ers that Blackmore only equaled once, and that was 
in ' Lorna Doone.' " Chicago Tribune.

THE TROUBADOURS AT HOME 

Their Lives and Personalities, their Songs, and their World. By JUSTIN H. SMITH, 
Professor of Modern History in Dartmouth College. 178 illus'ns. 2 vols., 8vo. $6.00. 

The idea of the work was most happy, and admirably has it been realized. Critic. 

The troubadours were not mere vagabond minstrels, but the elite minds of a remarkable age 
soldiers, diplomats, and princes as well as poets and musicians. They were the teachers of Dante and 
Petrarch, the founders of our literature, music, and general culture ; and without knowing them we 
cannot understand modern life cannot even understand ourselves. 

This work not only gives all the significant facts about them in the light of recent scientific 
scholarship, but reconstructs their world and places them in it as real personalities, living, loving, and 
singing. It is poetry, romance, and travel based on history and literary criticism. 



NEEDED : ANNALES DU MIDI, Paris [Translation]: " It fills a real gap, not only for the Anglo-Saxon 
public, but even for us." THE DIAL, Chicago : " By far the most ample and trustworthy store of information 
about the troubadours and their world to be found in English." CHURCHMAN, New York: " A work of 
unique value." 

SCHOLARLY : ROMANIA, Paris [Translation] : " The list of sources is ample, and it is evident that 
these sources have been used with care. The translations iu verse or prose prove a real knowledge of the 
Provencal language." AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW: "A reliable account of Provencal lyric poetry, 
expressed in easy, familiar language, and made real by a successful attempt to restore the civilization which 
produced it."

FREDERICK MAX MULLER. 

The death of Max Miiller brings up again 
the old question concerning the importance of 
the popularizer as an agent for the advance- 
ment of science, and sets once more in sharp 
contrast the attitudes respectively assumed 
toward such a man by the reading public and 
the body of quiet scientific workers. Max 
Miiller, like Kenan, Froude, Huxley and Tyn- 
dall to name only a few of his famous con- 
temporaries had in preeminent degree the 
gift of style, the charm of graceful literary 
art, and the power to interest ordinary minds 
in subjects not easily forced upon their atten- 
tion. This was at once his bane as a scholar 
and the secret of his popular success. Trans- 
ferring our attention for a moment from the 
individual to the group which he so typically 
illustrated, we must say that the attitude to- 
ward such men of those critics who stand for 
the methods of pure science is apt to be very 
ungracious, being compounded of no small 
amount of intellectual arrogance, and even of 
envy, mingled with the more legitimate ele- 
ments that derive from the sense of superior 
knowledge and firmer hold upon the facts. In 
the view of the extremer devotees of pure sci- 
ence, it becomes a misdemeanor to write attrac- 
tively, and a felony to achieve popularity with 
the laity. Sometimes, as was notably true in 
the case of Kenan, the offence is reckoned so 
great that the offender receives only the most 
grudging sort of recognition from his fellow- 
workers in the same field, although in their 
hearts they are conscious that he stands abreast 
of the strongest of them, even when judged by 
the most exacting standards. He has ventured 
to be popular, and the fact that he has re- 
mained rigorously scientific does not remove 
the stigma in the eyes of these self-constituted 
guardians of scholarship. 

Max Muller was far from being a philolo- 
gist and a student of comparative religion in 
the sense in which Kenan was both, and his 
intellectual armor was doubtless vulnerable at 
many points ; nevertheless, it is unquestionably 
true that he accomplished much work of solid 
value, and deserved well of science for his 
That science, especially as repre- 



services.

[Nov. 16, 



sented by the younger school of men trained 
at the German universities, has done him 
something less than justice, is a fact that must 
be admitted by the impartial observer. If he 
failed in accuracy of knowledge, if he could 
not overcome certain intellectual prejudices, 
if he did not keep abreast of the scholarship 
of his time, his was still a larger personality 
than that of many a critic who assailed him, 
and who, without one-tenth of his actual ac- 
complishment, affected to hold his authority 
beneath serious consideration. 

Max Miiller was born in Dessau in 1823, 
and was a son of the poet Wilhelm Miiller. 
The artistic temperament which was thus his 
birthright came near to making of him a 
musician instead of a scholar, and resulted in 
at least one piece of purely literary compo- 
sition, the "Deutsche Liebe" of his youth, 
an exquisite bit of refined sentimentalism long 
familiar to English readers in the translation 
entitled "Memories." He studied Sanskrit at 
Leipzig, and translated the "Hitopadesa" at 
the age of twenty-one. Continuing his Sans- 
krit studies under Bopp and Burnouf, he went 
to England in 1846 for the purpose of editing 
the "Rig- Veda," a commission given him by 
the East India Company. This great under- 
taking, which was, however, in large part per- 
formed by another hand, occupied him largely 
for nearly thirty years, the last of the six 
volumes being dated as late as 174. He 
made his home at Oxford, and became succes- 
sively a member, a fellow, a sub-librarian, and 
a professor of the University. In 1875, he 
practically resigned his chair, and gave his 
chief attention to the work of editing "The 
Sacred Books of the East," a series that event- 
ually numbered thirty or forty volumes. 
Among the almost innumerable publications 
of his busy half-century of writing, mention 
should be made of his "Lectures on the Sci- 
ence of Language," his "Chips from a German 
Workshop," his "History of Sanskrit Liter- 
ature," his Hibbert lectures on "The Origin 
and Growth of Religions," and his " Science 
of Thought." Nor should we fail to include 
in this list the translation of Kant's " Kritik 
der Reinen Vernunft," which he made upon 
the occasion of the centenary of that great 
work, and which is so significant of his con- 
stant adherence to the Kantian system and 
the Kantian method of envisaging philosoph- 
ical problems. His fifty and more years of 
Oxford life have been comparatively unevent- 
ful, save for the delivery of his lectures, the 



publication of his books, and the honors be- 
stowed upon him by potentates and by learned 
societies. Strange to say, this life-long stu- 
dent of Indian thought and language never 
visited the land which engaged so large a 
share of his attention. He was one of the 
most famous of Orientalists, but he never set 
foot in an Oriental country. 

Miiller rode his hobbies very hard, and per- 
haps the hardest ridden of them all was his 
way of accounting for mythology as a disease 
of language. Finding the names of the Greek 
and Hindu deities to be words traceable to 
the phenomena of nature the sun, the sky, 
and the clouds he theorized to the effect 
that all mythology resulted from primitive 
descriptions of natural objects, the sense in 
which the words were used gradually becom- 
ing modified into metaphorical meanings, until 
the literal signification of the terms had been 
quite forgotten. This seemed to be a key 
that would fit almost any of the locks of folk- 
lore and popular theology, and with it he 
sought to reveal the innermost secrets of the 
classical and Oriental cosmogonies. It was a 
very popular theory a generation ago, and had 
things its own way with the general public. 
It was so easy, and at the same time so pleas- 
ing to the poetic sense, to reduce every primi- 
tive belief to some variation of the omnipres- 
ent solar myth that readers were quite capti- 
vated by the notion. But the thing was 
overdone, and a sense of humor began to exert 
its corrosive action upon this too pleasing 
theory, until solar myths lost their favor, and 
few are now so poor to do them reverence. 

Miiller had many quarrels and controver- 
sies in his special field of Sanskrit, and in the 
wider field of comparative philology, but these 
need not concern us here. His one great 
quarrel with modern scientific thought was 
based upon his view of the origin of human 
speech. During the sixties and seventies, 
when Darwinism was having pretty much its 
own way with most classes of thinkers, from 
naturalists to philosophers, it encountered what 
seemed to be a very ugly snag in the oppo- 
sition of Miiller, based upon strictly philo- 
logical grounds. The theory of evolution 
seemed to offer no way of accounting for the 
beginning of intelligible speech, and, although 
Darwinians were convinced that this difficulty 
could not be a real one, they were nevertheless 
put to their wits' ends to deal with it as it was 
presented in Miiller's cogent argument. The 
process of development, he said, could readily

enough be traced back to the roots of a lan- 
guage, but there it seemed to stick. The 
Aryan roots were perfectly definite symbols 
for definite concepts, and they seemed to have 
no reasonably imaginable antecedents. " There 
they are, gentlemen," he said in substance, 
" and what are you going to do about it ? " 
The "bow-wow" theory, which ascribed to 
them an onomatopoetic character, was too 
childish for serious consideration, and the 
" pooh-pooh " theory, which sought to explain 
them as the primitive symbols of emotional 
conditions, was quite inadequate to account 
for them. During his later years, Miiller 
himself seemed to feel that his negative atti- 
tude toward the most pregnant conception of 
modern philosophy was hardly becoming a 
man of science, and he came to realize that 
the mere lack of a reasonable theory of the 
origin of language was not enough to make 
men believe that it had no rational origin. His 
own view became considerably modified by the 
speculations of Professor Noiie, and he ac- 
cepted the " yo-heave-ho " theory, which ac- 
counted for the mysterious roots as a product of 
the clamor concomitant of men engaged in 
common labor as providing at least a provis- 
ional method for the solution of the problem. 
As a matter of fact, this problem, as well as 
the allied problem of accounting for thought 
without language, no longer seems as formidable 
as it did a generation ago. The doctrine of 
evolution carries with it the absolute necessity 
for the evolution of speech by some natural 
process, and the exact nature of that process is 
a matter of detail that science may safely be 
trusted to make clear. As for M tiller's con- 
tention that thought is impossible without lan- 
guage, it may be said that Whitney's acute 
polemic assailed it with considerable success a 
generation ago, and that the natural psychology 
of the past score of years, as contrasted with 
the artificial psychology of an earlier period, 
has made it evident that thought and language 
are parallel developments, to neither of which 
can any absolute priority be assigned. Perhaps 
the clearest exposition of this scientific view is 
that made by Romanes about fifteen years ago. 
In this, as in many other matters, Muller's 
intellect never quite escaped from the meta- 
physical stage of development, a fact which is 
best illustrated by his thoroughgoing accept- 
ance of the Kantian philosophy as the final 
expression of metaphysical thought. "That 
last infirmity of the philosophic mind," as the 
*' Kantian superstition " is styled by a recent 



writer for these pages, stiffened to the end the 
intellectual processes of the brilliant scholar 
whose death we now deplore, and impeded their 
free and natural operation. There is no re- 
proach in this, but there is some occasion for 
regret that a thinker of Muller's capacity should 
have been kept many years behind his age by 
the trammels of a system that had long since 
accomplished its work.

ters since Goethe is Balzac. In the last half-century 
Balzac has gained immensely in the esteem of both 
the people and the critics, until of late it is being 
proclaimed, "A greater than Shakespeare is here." 

If we would compare the greatest of dramatists 
with the greatest of novelists, we might well set 
over against each other such masterpieces as " King 
Lear " and " Old Goriot." Which of these tragedies 
of base filial ingratitude affects us the more power- 
fully ? Neither Lear nor Goriot are heroic figures. 
Lear is full of a teasing petulance, is full of com- 
plaints and curses against his ungrateful daughters, 
and insists so selfishly and importunately upon his 
paternal rights to verbal and actual gratitude that 
our sympathy is chilled. He frets and fumes too 
much to be a convincing hero. As against this, 
the uncomplaining devotion and ceaseless sacrifice 
of Goriot are perfect. Lear bestows merely his 
kingdom, and clamors for gratitude; Goriot be- 
stows everything, to life itself ; and utters no bitter, 
reproaching word. Yet Goriot is so petty and weak 
and narrow and sordid that the heroic vanishes, 
and we see merely a display of stupid instinct. 
Neither Lear nor Goriot evince real magnanimity ; 
both are ignoble. And Lear, as an unreasonable, 
querulous dotard, leads us to somewhat excuse his 
daughters. Indeed, Lear himself in his sanest mo- 
ment practically acknowledges that their conduct is 
not groundless, when he says that he is " more 
sinned against than sinning." His daughters show 
consideration, and even more, when Regan says : 

" For his particular, I'll receive him gladly, 
But not one follower." 

The sentiment is echoed by Goneril. But Goriot, 
ever patient and humble, gives not the slightest 
pretext for the immeasurable heartlessness of his 
frivolous daughters. If, then, the object of tragedy 
is to awaken pity in the beholder, Goriot is the 
more convincing figure of the two, is much the 
finer and completer creation. 

We might go on to point out that Eugenie Gran- 
det is in some ways superior to Juliet, and Nanon to 
Juliet's nurse, and certainly Grandet is superior to 
Shylock. As an analyst of the bourgeoisie, Balzac 
is incomparable ; he knows them to the finger-tips,

THE DIAL, 



[Nov. 16, 



for he is one of them. In depicting the passion for 
pelf, he far outdistances Shakespeare and all com- 
petitors. Farther, a quality which adds much to 
our enjoyment of Balzac's works is the sympathy 
for his creations which we imbibe from Balzac him- 
self. That is, in Balzac we find a fascinating lyric 
tone quite lacking to the serene and cold dramatic 
objectivity of Shakespeare. With what a rare gusto 
Balzac enters into the life of his Comedie Hu- 
maine! With what a vital intensity he feels for 
the living and breathing people of his real world ! 
He enlists our sympathy not only by the general 
tone of his narrative, but by definite appeals; as 
when he says of Nanon, " At twenty-two years of 
age the poor girl had been unable to find a situa- 
tion, so repulsive was her face to almost everyone." 
But Shakespeare never makes such an impression 
upon our feelings ; we cannot conceive that he 
laughed or wept with his creations. 

Another advantage that Balzac has over Shake- 
speare is that he belongs not to the age of spectators, 
but of readers. The demands of stagecraft and of 
a vulgar audience so hamper Shakespeare in the 
full and free development of characterization that 
we think it a thousand pities that he had not en- 
joyed the scope and freedom of the novel. As 
appealing to the spectator and the hearer, rather 
than to the reader, Shakespeare uses broad and 
striking effects, almost neglecting the half-tones. 
Since the novelist's art is greater and more signifi- 
cant than the dramatist's, we can never cease 
regretting that Shakespeare was not a novelist 
from whom also we could have had a Comedie 
Humaine, which might be dramatized with sur- 
passing force. For the future, certainly, the drama 
tends to base itself in the higher art of the novel. 

But if we regret that Shakepeare was a play- 
writer, we regret still more that he followed the 
fashion of his time and gave his characters the 
mediaeval setting of courts and kings. Old Goriot 
is vastly nearer to us than King Lear ; that Lear 
cannot have a retainer more or less, is a motif of 
as little interest to us as the lack of proper funeral 
rites is in the Greek drama. The triumph of Shake- 
speare is that, despite the setting of lords and un- 
derlings, the vitality of a common humanity still 
touches the modern mind. But Balzac is absolutely 
modern and democratic ; we breathe not the at- 
mosphere of courts but of shops ; we see and recog- 
nize a life which pulsates in myriad forms around us. 

But it may be said, and rightly, that Shakespeare, 
although a playwright depicting an outgrown type 
of society, is infinitely above Balzac in universality 
and grasp. The characters of Shakespeare have 
a wholeness of creation, are many-sided, many- 
motived real men and women ; while Balzac's char- 
acters are too often puppets pulled by a single string. 
Shakespeare gives us the condensed perfect essence 
of reality the ideal of realism and the realism of 
the ideal. Moreover, Shakespeare achieves reality 
in a single stroke ; the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet 
is as real in one page as Nanon in fifty though 



we must grant that Balzac does not offend us with 
the Zolaistic coarseness of Shakespeare. Balzac 
gives us Leonardesque portraits, drawn, framed, 
and embellished with infinite and loving care ; while 
Shakespeare presents rough Rembrantesque etchings 
which tell the whole story in a few powerful lines. 
And we need not enlarge upon the obvious fact that 
Shakespeare has in the highest degree those very 
important elements in which Balzac is entirely 
lacking, namely, humor and poetry. In short, 
Shakespeare is the greater genius ; yet just because 
he is playwright and his mise en sc&ne archaic, we 
read him out of a sense of duty, but Bdlzac out of 
delight. HIRAM M. STANLEY.

MR. WARNER AS AN EDITOR. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In your appreciative farewell to Charles Dudley 
Warner, in your last issue, occur these words: "He 
was the nominal editor of the Library of the World's 
Best Literature ' "; and the rest of the sentence empha- 
sizes, in an especially misleading fashion, the impres- 
sion that the real burden of that work fell upon other 
shoulders. 

Many circumstances combine to urge prompt and 
earnest protest against this erroneous statement. One 
of the chief temptations at present besetting our suc- 
cessful literary workers is the opportunity to sell their 
names, as a means of advertising work which is not in 
the full sense their own. That some well-known men 
have actually yielded to such golden baits, seems certain. 
Against all such commercialism, degrading to the artist 
and to our national life generally, Mr. Warner has pro- 
tested often in ringing words. His recent series of 
romances was perhaps marred, as a work of art, by too 
strenuous insistance upon just such notes of warning. 
The cynics will rejoice to accept any intimation that 
he himself drifted with the current. 

A leading editorial writer of THE DIAL contributed 
more signed articles to Mr. Warner's " Library " than 
any other contributor. That writer's well-earned repute 
for fairness, accuracy, and caution, added as it inevita- 
bly will be, in this case, to the great force of THE DIAL 
itself, will render this statement hard indeed to contro- 
vert. Yet it would probably have been felt by Mr. 
Warner as the most injurious and misleading assertion 
that could have been made concerning him. Certainly 
the present writer is unable to characterize it in softer 
terms. The circumstances, then, justify frankness. 

The classical field was doubtless the one large historic 
demesne of literature in which Mr. Warner felt least 
willing to trust his own knowledge and judgment. In 
this department, and no other, he states in his final note 
that one of his assistants " had charge." The present 
letter is based on fullest knowledge of that department 
during the issue of twenty-two out of the thirty vol- 
umes. Mr. Warner in every case decided whether an 
author should appear at all, and how much space should 
be allotted him. His test was, invariably, Can one or 
more quoted passages be presented, of interest and 
value to readers at the present day ? If not, no mere 
name could assure admission. No assignment of the 
biographical essay was authorized, without careful in-

quiry as to the literary capacity and taste of the pro- 
posed writer. Not one such essay, even from Miss 
Preston or Professor Shorey, was sent to the printer 
until Mr. Warner had given it at least one careful 
uninterrupted critical perusal. The galley and page 
proofs also received his unremitting scrutiny. Essays 
by eminent scholars, though paid for in full, were cast 
aside because they did not satisfy Mr. Warner's demand 
for intrinsic interest and literary form. So able an 
essayist as the late Thomas Davidson recast every page 
of his paper on Sappho, under strictures from the 
editor-in-chief. 

I am assured by those who know best, that every 
page in the thirty volumes of the " Library " received 
the same conscientious attention. We may well believe 
that a work so extensive was never prepared, in so brief 
a time, more fully under one alert eye, and informed 
by the spirit of one man. It is true that every worker 
felt encouraged to use all his capacities with the largest 
freedom; but that freedom was precisely one of the 
qualities brought to the task by Mr. Warner's genial 
open-minded catholic nature. He never tolerated the 
mere scissors-and-paste work so dismally familiar in 
too many big books. The group of younger writers 
gathered about him in those days can never cease to be 
grateful for his inspiration, his searching and stimulat- 
ing criticism, his unflagging sympathy. If any other 
shoulders lightened the editorial load, it was Mrs. 
Runkle's. The volume of brief lyrics, in particular, 
was actually edited by her. But she often declared, 
as did Mr. Warner himself, that she was first called in 
precisely because, through many years of professional 
comradeship, she had come to know Mr. Warner's 
literary ideals and methods as well as he did himself. 

As to the rest of us, let me still take space for one 
typical illustration, at my own expense. Mr. Warner 
had read in early life, and recalled with delight, the 
lives of the philosophers by " Diogenes Laertius." He 
insisted that the sketch of Socrates, in particular, must 
go in. After a week or two spent in repairing his own 
blank ignorance, the classical editor reported with em- 
phasis, " It is a medley of misstatements in the original, 
and made doubly idiotic by the atrocious Bohn perver- 
sion." " Very well, then, make your own translation." 
" But Diogenes himself is a bewildered plagiarist, an 
egregious ass." " Very likely; say so as bluntly as you 
please, in a half-page biography. But I enjoyed him, 
and I want him in. A lot of him, too ! " And eventu- 
ally Diogenes got his fourteen pages, over which the 
great editor renewed his youthful glee. Lysias, exempli 
gratia, and his precious old olive-stump, are alike un- 
mentioned, for converse reasons. The " Library," like 
every large book, has flaws and uneven places; but the 
face of Mr. Warner shines out from every page. 

I am sure all who know the truth will be eager to 
state it more strongly than has been possible in this 
letter. Certainly no one, here unnamed, has a right 
to share, in any appreciable degree, the real editorial 
responsibility for the " Library." Its form and its 
spirit express, more than all else, the unwearying 
energy, devotion, wisdom, and taste of Charles Dudley 
Warner. L. 

Brooklyn, N. Y., Nov. 3, 1900. 

[We cheerfully acknowledge that our correspond- 
ent had better opportunities than our own to know 
just how the great " Library " was edited, and if 
what we wrote upon the subject has been taken to 



reflect in any way upon the literary integrity of the 
late Mr. Warner, we can only say that nothing 
could have been farther from our thought. As far 
as our experience went during the publication of 
the work, it seemed to show that a very large share 
of the correspondence and other editorial functions 
was assumed by Mr. George H. Warner, although 
of course under the general direction of his bro- 
ther. As a mere matter of the days and hours 
given to the work, we supposed it fair to say that 
the larger credit should be given to Mr. George 
Warner ; but we had no intention of implying that 
the editor-in-chief did not hold the reins in his 
bands all the time, or that he was the mere figure- 
head that our use of the word " nominal " might, 
as we now see, be taken to indicate. On the 
whole, the protest of our correspondent takes the 
form of a statement so interesting that we are not 
sorry to have been its innocent provoking cause.

THE GKEAT APOSTLE OF EVOLUTION.* 

As Professor Huxley, on his memorable 
visit to America in 1876, entered New York 
harbor on the steamer "Germanic," he was 
greatly interested in the tug-boats which tore 
fiercely up and down and across the bay. He 
looked long at them, and finally turned to Mr. 
Smalley and said : " If I were not a man I think 
I should like to be a tug." This casual remark 
not only exhibited his delight in the restless 
energy which he saw displayed, but in a very 
true sense also reflects the spirit and the life- 
work of the man who uttered it. Evolutionist, 
agnostic, biologist, controversialist, reformer, 
essayist, philosopher, investigator, and teacher, 
he was always and everywhere the practical 
man in affairs but not of them, carrying an 
Atlas load of the world's work, and tirelessly 
seeking to move, to guide, and to control the 
thought of his age in the shifting tide of public 
opinion. The restless activity of this versatile 
leader is evident on every page of the " Life 
and Letters " edited by his son, Mr. Leonard 
Huxley. 

It is quite impossible to summarize these 
letters to the brilliant galaxy of correspondents, 
men eminent in science, in philosophy, in poli- 
tics, in education, and in literature. Foremost, 
as might be expected, are the names of Darwin, 
Spencer, Tyndall, Hooker, Haeckel, Romanes,

Clifford, Clodd, and others who shared in the 
battle for Evolution. To these must be added 
the names of many prominent biologists in 
England and on the Continent, and a few from 
America. In literary circles, Huxley corres- 
ponded with Charles Kmgsley, Matthew 
Arnold, Jowett, Lecky, John Morley, and 
Tennyson. The wealth of scientific, philosophic, 
and literary lore in these two volumes of letters 
may be inferred from this choice list of corres- 
pondents, but this gives no hint of the inimit- 
able style in which Huxley wrote what for us 
is a running comment on the topics of his times. 
And they were momentous times. The corres- 
pondence covers the period from 1850 to 1895, 
years which saw the promulgation and elabora- 
tion of the Theory of Organic Evolution and the 
accumulation of evidence in its support ; the 
extension of this idea into the fields of philoso- 
phy and religion, though not without a long, 
vigorous, and often bitter conflict with the 
established forms of thought ; the multiplica- 
tion of educational agencies, and the enlarge- 
ment of educational ideals by the development 
of scientific and technical instruction at the 
great centres of culture ; and lastly, though not 
yet fully accomplished, the revision of theo- 
logical dogma. In all of these changes, 
Huxley played no small part. His services to 
Evolution are evidenced by his published 
works, more than a third of the eighty- seven 
essays listed in the appendix being devoted to 
this theme. He was also the platform expo- 
nent of the Evolutionary propaganda, and well 
deserves the title of the " Great Apostle of 
Evolution," though he himself thus modestly 
estimates his services in a letter to the Bishop 
of Ripon : 

11 As for me, in part from force of circumstance and 
in part from a conviction I could be of most use in that 
way, I have played the part of something between 
maid-of-all-work and gladiator-general for Science, 
and deserve no such prominence as your kindness has 
assigned to me." 

His matchless skill in controversy undoubt- 
edly won for Huxley his widest renown. His 
famous bon mot at the Oxford meeting of the 
British Association in 1860, where he helped 
to extort a fair hearing for Darwin's ideas, 
will long be remembered. In the course of 
the discussion, Bishop Wilberforce rallied 
Huxley on his descent from a monkey. The 
tactical advantage which this descent to per- 
sonalities gave was instantly grasped by Hux- 
ley, who, turning to his neighbor, said, " The 
Lord hath delivered him into my hands ! ' 
The exact words used in this impromptu reply 



have been variously reported. We learn that 
the most accurate account is that of Mr. J. R. 
Green, as follows : 

" I asserted and I repeat that a man has no 
reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his grand- 
father. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel 
shame in recalling it would rather be a man a man 
of restless and versatile intellect who, not content 
with an equivocal f success in his own sphere of activ- 
ity, plunges into scientific questions with which be has 
no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless 
rhetoric, and distract the attention of his bearers from 
the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and 
skilled appeals to religious prejudice." 

No doubt Huxley enjoyed a good fight. In 
1859 he wrote Darwin, " I am sharpening 
up my claws and beak in readiness." Again, 
writing to Haeckel a propos of his " Morphol- 
ogie," he says : 

"With respect to the polemic excursus, of course, I 
chuckle over them most sympathetically, and then say 
how naughty they are ! I have done too much of the 
same sort of thing not to sympathize entirely with you j 
and I am much inclined to think that it is a good thing 
for a man, once at any rate in his life, to perform a 
public war-dance against all sorts of humbug and im- 
posture." 

To John Morley concerning one of his critics : 
" Controversy is as abhorrent to me as gin to a 
reclaimed drunkard ; but oh dear ! it would be so nice 
to squelch that pompous impostor." 

His persistency in following up his attacks 
appears in a letter to his son in regard to hi& 
opposition to " General " Booth's financial 
project for the relief of London's poor : 

" Attacking the Salvation Army may look like the 
advance of a forlorn hope, but this old dog has never 
yet let go after fixing his teeth into anything or any- 
body, and he is not going to begin now. And it is only 
a question of holding on." 

The following lines from his private journal, 
written at the birth of his eldest son in 1856, 
reveal the sincerity of Huxley's motives, his 
love of truth as he saw it, and hatred of a lie r 
" To smite all humbugs, however big ; to give a 
nobler tone to science ; to set an example of abstinence 
from petty personal controversies, and of toleration, 
for everything bullying ; to be indifferent as to whether 
the work is recognized as mine or not, so long as it i& 
done : are these my aims ? 1860 will show." 

The same spirit breathes in a courteous letter 
to Rev. E. McLure, written in 1891 : 

" So far as I know myself, after making due deduc- 
tion for the ambition of youth and a fiery temper, 
which ought to (but unfortunately does not) get cooler 
with age, my sole motive is to get at the truth in all 
things. I do not care one straw about fame, present or 
posthumous, and I loathe notoriety, but I do care ta 
have that desire manifest and recognized." 

Huxley's scientific achievements were soon 

tHuxley had no recollection of using the word " equivocal."

recognized by memberships in learned societies 
conferred upon him at home and abroad. At 
the time of his death he was connected with 
more than seventy-five such organizations. His 
leadership was also acknowledged in England 
by election to positions of responsibility in 
various scientific bodies, the most notable be- 
ing the Presidency of the Royal Society. The 
government also availed itself of his services 
on a number of important commissions which 
dealt with the Fisheries, Vivisection, Con- 
tagious Diseases, Medical Acts, Educational 
Institutions for Ireland, the Universities of 
Scotland, Scientific Instruction, and the Ad- 
vancement of Science. 

His services to education cover the whole 
field from the kindergarten to the most ad- 
vanced university instruction. For many years 
he acted as Examiner for the Science and Art 
department, while his service on the London 
School Board, though brief, was of far-reaching 
importance. As chairman of the committee 
which revised the school curriculum, he exerted 
his influence strongly in favor of practical in- 
struction in the sciences, technical instruction 
in household arts for girls, the introduction of 
systematic instruction in drawing, while above 
all he insisted upon the importance of the 
adequate teaching of morals. It was at this 
time that he surprised his Liberal friends by 
his outspoken advocacy of Bible instruction in 
the public schools : 

" As English literature, as world-old history, as moral 
teaching, as the Magna Charta of the poor and of the 
oppressed, the most democratic book in the world, he 
could not spare it. 'I do not say,' he adds, ' that even 
the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs 
no supplement. But I do believe that the human race 
is not yet, possibly may never be, in a position to dis- 
pense with it." 

His own letters abound in Biblical allusions re- 
vealing his remarkable familiarity with Sacred 
Writ. 

Huxley's ideals of university education are 
well known. Two American incidents illustrate 
his feeling with regard to the use of educational 
endowments. He declined to be shown about 
the buildings at Yale, saying to Professor 
Marsh : " Show me what you have got inside 
of them ; I can see plenty of bricks and mortar 
in my own country." Commenting upon the 
liberal provision for research at Johns Hopkins 
University, he remarked : 

" It has been my fate to see great educational funds 
fossilize into mere bricks and mortar in the petrifying 
springs of architecture, with nothing left to work them. 
A great warrior is said to have made a desert and 



called it peace. Trustees have sometimes made a pal- 
ace and called it a university." 

In the preface to the American edition of 
these letters, Mr. Leonard Huxley calls atten- 
tion to the cordial reception accorded to his 
father's writings and lectures in this country, 
and his reciprocal feeling toward us. 

" His own interest in the present problems of the 
country and the possibilities of its future was always 
keen, not merely as touching the development of a 
vast political force one of the dominant factors of 
the near future but far more as touching the char- 
acter of its approaching greatness. Huge territories 
and vast resources were of small interest to him in 
comparison with the use to which they should be put. 
None felt more vividly than he that the true greatness 
of a nation would depend upon the spirit of the princi- 
ples it adopted, upon the character of the individuals 
who make up the nation and shape the channels in 
which the currents of its being will hereafter flow. . . . 
This was the note he struck in the appeal for intellect- 
ual sincerity and clearness which he made at the end 
of bis New York Lectures on Evolution.' . . . The 
interest with which he followed the later development 
of social problems need not be dwelt on here, except 
to say that he watched their earlier maturity in America 
as an indication of the problems which would after- 
wards call for a solution in his own country." 

His feeling about our Civil War was like 
that of many Englishmen; his sympathies were 
with the South, though he recognized the 
cause and approved the outcome of the con- 
flict. Writing to his sister, at Nashville, in 
1864, he says : 

" I am in the condition of most thoughtful English- 
men. My heart goes with the South, and my head 
with the North. I have no love for the Yankees, and 
I delight in the energy and self-sacrifice of your people; 
but for all that, I cannot doubt that whether you beat 
the Yankees or not, you are struggling to uphold a 
system which must, sooner or later, break down. I 
have not the smallest sentimental sympathy with the 
negro; don't believe in him at all, in short. But it is 
clear to me that slavery means, for the white man, bad 
political economy; bad social morality; bad internal 
political organization, and a bad influence upon free 
labour and freedom all over the world. For the sake 
of the white man, therefore, for your children and 
grandchildren, directly, and for mine, indirectly, I 
wish to see this system ended. Would that the South 
had had the wisdom to initiate that end without this 
miserable war ! " 

The letters of Huxley are intensely human, 
revealing the passionate sincerity of the man 
and his interest not merely in the Book of 
Nature, in pure knowledge, and in the problems 
of existence, but also in the practical affairs of 
human life. His missives to his friends are 
not studied literary efforts, as were his essays, 
which he confesses he re-wrote five or six times. 
They are full of the dash and spirit of the im- 
promptu, while with magnificent abandon he

revels in allusion, jest, and pun, in his own and 
foreign tongues ancient and modern. Many a 
keen thrust does he give his adversaries and 
his friends too. The charming bonhomie which 
pervades his letters is unsurpassed in any cor- 
respondence which has come to light in recent 
years. Listen to his invitation to his good 
friend, Dr. Anton Dohrn, of the Naples Marine 
Station : 

"I await the 'Prophecies of the Holy Antonius ' 
anxiously. Like the Jews of old, I come of an unbe- 
lieving generation, and need a sign. The bread and the 
oil, also the chamber in the wall, shall not fail the 
prophet when he comes in August: nor Donner und 
Blitzen either. . . . And, oh my Diogenes, happy in a 
tub of arthropodous Entwickelungsgeschichte, despise 
not beefsteaks, nor wives either. They also are good." 

And this word of encouragement to a fellow- 
Philistine : 

" MY DEAR JOHNNY You are certainly improving. 
As a practitioner in the use of cold steel myself, I have 
read your letter in to-day's Nature, mit Ehrfurcht und 
Bewunderung.' . . . God be with thee, my son, and 
strengthen the contents of thy gall-bladder! Ever 
thine, T. H. HUXLEY." 

By far the most notable and interesting of 
his correspondence is that with his honored 
friend Charles Kingsley. Replying to a letter 
of sympathy at the death of his eldest son, 
Huxley reveals the very depths of his religious 
convictions : 

''My convictions, positive and negative, on all the 
matters of which you speak, are of long and slow 
growth, and are firmly rooted. But the great blow 
which fell upon me seemed to stir them to their foun- 
dation, and had I lived a couple of centuries earlier I 
could have fancied a devil scoffing at me and them 
and asking me what profit it was to have stripped 
myself of the hopes and consolations of the mass of 
mankind ? To which my only reply was and is Oh 
devil ! truth is better than much profit. I have searched 
over the grounds of my belief, and if wife and child 
and name and fame were all to be lost to me one after 
the other as the penalty, still I will not lie. . . . 
Kicked into the world a boy without guide or training, 
or with worse than none, I confess to my shame that 
few men have drunk deeper of all kinds of sin than I. 
Happily, my course was arrested in time before I 
had earned absolute destruction and for long years 
I have been slowly and painfully climbing, with many 
a fall, towards better things. And when I look back, 
what do I find to have been the agents of my redemp- 
tion ? The hope of immortality or of future reward ? 
I can honestly say that for these fourteen years such a 
consideration has not entered my head. No, I can tell 
you exactly what has been at work. Sartor Resartus 
led me to know that a deep sense of religion was com- 
patible with the entire absence of theology. Secondly, 
science and her methods gave me a resting-place in- 
dependent of authority and tradition. Thirdly, love 
opened up to me a view of the sanctity of human na- 
ture, and impressed me with a deep sense of responsi- 
bility. ... If in the supreme moment when I looked 



down into my boy's grave my sorrow was full of sub- 
mission and without bitterness, it is because these 
agencies have worked upon me, and not because I have 
ever cared whether my poor personality shall remain 
distinct for ever from the All from whence it came 
and whither it goes. 

" And thus, my dear Kingsley, you will understand 
what my position is. I may be quite wrong, and in 
that case I know I shall have to pay the penalty for 
being wrong. But I can only say with Luther, ' Gott

THE KULERS OF SOUTHERN ITALY.* 

It is two years since Mr. Crawford pub- 
lished that great vision of Eome called " Ave 
Roma Immortalis," which fairly established 
his reputation as a romantic historian. In 
the work entitled " The Rulers of the South " 
his observation takes a more extensive view ; 
and the plan is chronological rather than topo- 
graphical. Briefly, it is a rapid survey of the 
tides of conquest which swept over Magna 
Gra3cia (as the Romans called the Southern 
provinces of the Italian mainland) and Sicily ; 
Malta is merely glanced at, and hardly de- 
serves a place in the title. Mr. Crawford's 
termini are the earliest legends on the one 
hand, and on the other the contest between 
Francis I. and Charles V. for the possession 
of Sicily. This range of over two thousand 
years is traversed with alert step and unflag- 
ging enthusiasm. The author's qualifications 
for his great task are peculiar, and almost too 
well-known to need recapitulation. No living 
foreigner knows Italy dialects, prejudices, 
village-life, superstitions, and all so inti- 
mately as Mr. Marion Crawford ; and cer- 
tainly no living man of letters could have 
handled his materials with greater skill or 
distilled them with more certainty into a fluent 
and fascinating narrative. 

In the first volume, after a graceful group- 
ing of the myths in whose half-light all the 
Mediterranean lands are steeped, Mr. Craw- 
ford rapidly summarizes the history of Sicily 
and Southern Italy through their successive 
possession by Sicelians, Phrenicians, Greeks ;

Romans, Byzantines, Goths, and Arabs ; Nor- 
mans, German Emperors and French ; Span- 
iards of Aragon and of Bourbon, and Savoy- 
ard Kings of Italy. He sharply fixes our 
attention on one great difference between the 
Italian South and all other countries bordering 
on the Mediterranean. 

" It has lacked strength of its own from the begin- 
ning, it has lacked the genius without which strength 
breeds monsters ; it has been wanting in the original 
character which bears modification but resists extirpa- 
tion; it has produced no race which another has not 
been able to enslave ; one people after another has 
taken possession of it, each amalgamating in some 
degree with the last, but the welding of races has not 
become a great race, nor has any first element out- 
lasted and outruled the others. It has been the prize 
of contending warriors, it has been the playground of 
magnificent civilizations, but it has neither acted the 
part of conqueror itself, nor has it ever produced a 
civilization of its own. ... In the balance of the 
world's forces Sicily has been feminine and reproduc- 
tive rather than masculine and creative ; endowed with 
supreme natural beauty, she has been loved by all, she 
has favored many, and she has borne sons to a few, 
sons such as Archimedes and Theocritus, Dionysius and 
Agathocles, King Roger and Frederick Second of 
Hohenstaufen, of Greek, Norman, and Norman-German 
blood. But if we ask for a great man whom we may 
call a Sicilian, we must ask what Sicilians were, and 
we shall receive different answers in different ages, 
'Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Spaniards and Italians have 
all been Sicilians at one time or another." 

Mr. Crawford's account of the Greek periods 
of domination in Sicily is both connected and 
luminous ; and the space he devotes to it is 
quite in proportion to its supreme importance 
in the history of the island. In general, he 
follows and agrees with Adolf Holm (whose 
'Geschichte Siciliens still remains untrans- 
lated) ; but his judgment, especially in ques- 
tions of geography and topography, is evi- 
dently based on his own knowledge, which is 
both comprehensive and accurate. The narra- 
tive is interspersed with passages of episodical 
brilliancy, as, for example, the description of 
the disastrous Athenian expedition a theme 
which never fails to stir profoundly all tellers 
of the tragic tale, from Thucydides down. The 
portraits of the Graeco-Sicilian worthies, too, 
are vivid and convincing : all readers will 
carry away from these pages a fresh and last- 
ing impression of Gelon, Hiero, the Dionysii, 
Dion, Hermocrates, and Timoleon. 

The Greek character, both individual and 
as a race, has often been judged as Mr. Craw- 
ford judges it ; but the verdict has seldom 
been so eloquently pronounced as in his words : 

" He [the Greek] was as incapable of sinking his 
highly original personality in the ranks of an organiza- 



tion as he was of devoting his whole energies to money- 
making ; he was a free lance rather than a trained sol- 
dier ; an artist, not a middle-class citizen ; a man of 
genius, not a banker. In the heat of enthusiasm there 
were few feats which he could not accomplish, and his 
restless blood could not brook the daily round of a 
humdrum existence. In war he loved the brilliant 
pageant, the high pjcan song, the splendid arms, the 
woven garlands, the air of triumph before the battle, 
and the trophy and the sacrifice after the fight. When 
peace followed war, he craved the excitement of the 
great Greek games, the emotions of the almost impos- 
sibly beautiful in art, the heart-beating of the reckless 
player throwing for high stakes, the physical intoxica- 
tion of wine, and the intellectual intoxication of the 
theatre ; and when these palled, he lost patience with 
peace and became the most gratuitously quarrelsome 
of human beings, taking offense at the hue of his 
neighbor's cloak, attacking a friend for an imaginary 
attack upon the least of his innumerable vanities, and 
making war about nothing, with the fine conviction of 
a thoroughly ill-tempered child, that smashes its new 
doll to atoms rather than be good for five minutes. 

" As the Greek was individually, so were the Greeks 
in a body, wherever they established themselves, iu the 
fertile plains and undulating hills of Asia Minor, in the 
wild mountains and isolated valleys of their own 
Greece, and that greater Hellas with which this story 
has been concerned. They were always at odds with 
each other, and they rarely fought a foreign foe with- 
out seeing the faces of their born countrymen in tbe 
ranks that opposed them ; they were alike incapable of 
submitting without a murmur to the rule of a single 
master, and of governing themselves as one whole by 
the orderly judgment of the many. Wherever they 
appeared they excited admiration and they often in- 
spired terror ; wherever they dwelt, even for a brief 
term of years, they left behind them works of lasting 
beauty ; but whereas, as artists, as poets, and as philos- 
ophers, they created a standard that has made rivalry 
impossible and imitation ridiculous, their government 
has left no trace in the lands they once inhabited, and 
their laws have had less influence upon the subsequent 
law-givers of mankind than those of the Chinese or 
the Aztecs. In their arts and in their literature they 
worked for all time ; in their government they were 
opportunists and intriguers, when they were not vision- 
aries, and the type of their race having disappeared 
from the world, the conditions under which it lived are 
beyond the comprehension of other civilized peoples." 

After the Greek came the Roman ; and into 
something over a hundred pages is condensed 
the stirring story of Roman domination, from 
the First Punic war to the downfall of the 
Western Empire, 476 A.D. ; seven hundred 
years of rule and misrule, in which the gigan- 
tic robberies of Verres make other oppressions 
seem but petty annoyances. With the brief 
ineffectual episode of Goths and Vandals, the 
first volume closes. 

Volume II. opens with the Byzantine period, 
followed in rapid succession by the Saracen 
invasions and the rise of Palermo as a Mo- 
hammedan capital, the appearance and domi-

nation of the Normans, the fierce struggle 
with the Angevins, the bloody Sicilian Ves- 
pers, and the varying successes of French 
King and Holy Roman Emperor. All these 
contests, whatever their other issue, had one 
unvarying result : they drenched the devoted 
island with blood " quicquid delirant reges, 
plectuntur Achivi." The immense recuper- 
ative power of the land is thus depicted by the 
author : 

" Those who know Sicily even superficially must 
easily realize that its conditions of prosperity could 
change with surprising quickness in the alternations of 
peace and war. It was an altogether agricultural coun- 
try, but it was, and still is, the richest in the Mediterra- 
nean. I will compare it, in its different states, to a 
great foundry or manufactory. Everything required 
for the production of valuable merchandise is present, 
waiting to be smelted, cast, turned, and finished. Fur- 
naces glow, hammers ring, lathes move silently and 
quickly, a thousand artisans are at work, and wealth is 
created hourly and instantly by sure and industrious 
hands. Presently comes the check; there is war, and 
the enemy is at hand, or the men strike and go away 
in a body. The place is the same, and yet it is all at 
once a dreary wilderness, the fires are gone out, the 
wind howls through the vast deserted sheds, the ma- 
chinery rusts in the silence, and it all looks as if only a 
miracle could bring back the extinguished life. Yet 
all things are ready for the making of wealth, as they 
were before. The enemy retires, or the strike is over, 
and in a day the factory is once again in the /roar and 
blast of production, alive and awake. 

" Thus also Sicily lay waste from time to time, and 
awoke again to instant riches at the golden touch of 
peace. There is not a valley in the whole island where 
men have not lain in ambush to kill other men, nor a 
field that has not been dyed crimson, nor a lovely defile 
of the mountains whose rivulet has not run red. Within 
the narrow seagirt space, six hundred miles round, 
Greeks and Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, 
Byzantines, Goths, Saracens, Normans, Frenchmen, 
Catalans, freemen and slaves fought almost unceasingly 
for more than two thousand years ; and in every inter- 
val of rest the rich soil brought forth its fruit an hun- 
dred fold, the blood-stained meadows blossomed again, 
and the battlefield of many nations was again the gar- 
den of the world." 

After his historical work is done, Mr. 
Crawford refreshes himself with a chapter of 
modern description devoted to the Camorra of 
Naples and the Mafia of Sicily, about which 
Americans know very little beyond their names. 
The Mafia, in particular, seems to have an 
elastic but thoroughly efficient organization 
which Tammany might envy, and whose powers 
of terrorism will not invite travellers, in spite 
of the author's comforting assurance that, ex- 
cept in a few dangerous localities, the traveller 
who has no vested interests in the islands " may 
go with safety where a Sicilian nobleman or a 
landholder hostile to the illicit powers would 



need the protection of a dozen mounted car- 
bineers." 

The style throughout alternates between 
straightforward nervous narrative and a certain 
quaint artlessness, with plenty of introductory 
"ands," quite in the manner of some monkish 
chronicler. The author has been reasonably 
careful in statements of fact ; but it certainly 
seems too strong to say (a propos of Hiero's 
ship with twenty banks of oars) that " nothing 
whatever is known as to the arrangement of 
the banks, even in the ordinary trireme " ; and 
that Breusing's researches have "completely 
destroyed the old-fashioned belief of scholars 
that three banks of oars situated one above 
the other could under any circumstances be 
pulled at the same time " (Vol. I., p. 243). 
The statement, too, on p. 82 of Vol. I., that 
" nothing that Bacchylides wrote has come 
down to us," was at no time exactly true ; and 
surely should be revised in the light of the 
recent discoveries. 

The volumes are handsomely printed, in 
uniform style with the " Ave Roma Immor- 
talis " ; and the beautiful photogravures and 
drawings by Brokman (the latter scattered 
through the text in rather haphazard fashion) 
illuminate the narrative at every turn.

A CHILD OF MANIFEST DESTINY.* 



When a man first does something very fine 
indeed, he may well fear or at least his 
friends may well fear for him that he will 
not be able to do something else worthy to be 
compared with it. Until we get used to it, 
genius so often seems accident. There must 
be some high wave which no other wave will 
reach. When M. Rostand had surprised the 
world with " Cyrano de Bergerac," it was not 
unnatural that the world should think that his 
next play could not sustain the effect. 

Nor did the advance reports entirely reas- 
sure the doubting. A play written especially 
for someone seems to lack spontaneity, even 
though the someone be Mme. Bernhardt. That 
great actress was to impersonate the unfor- 
tunate, but still the slight, the weak little 
King of Rome. It was a Napoleonic play, 
a part of that strange revival of an old en- 
thusiasm that was interesting but ephemeral

And it was a play of our own century, almost 
our own time ; it might be brilliant, clever, 
emotional, but it could hardly have the true 
atmosphere of romance. Even the accounts of 
the play's success in Paris were not convincing. 

Such misgivings, such doubts, were set at 
rest when the book itself was read, doubly 
buried when the play was seen. The book 
may now be read by anyone. The play will 
doubtless be widely acted, if less widely than 
" Cyrano de Bergerac," not because it is less 
great as a play but because it is greater. M. 
Rostand has even bettered his first masterpiece. 
This tragedy, with its poor, weak little hero, 
with all its frivolity, all its decadent circum- 
stance, makes a stronger effect than its wonder- 
ful predecessor, stronger even if less obvious. 

Perhaps as one sees it in New York, not 
a French play given by French actors for a 
French audience, but simply a play like any 
other, perhaps one gains something which 
will go to make up for what is certainly lost. 
We in America cannot read or see it with the 
feelings of those who are themselves, almost, 
part actors in the tragedy. We lose all that. 
But losing that, we can see better the wider 
application, the broader humanity, that is in 
the piece, and by that be stirred and moved 
to an emotion, not more genuine than the 
half-patriotic feeling of the Frenchman, but 
wider in its appeal. For in this young man 
yearning after that great inheritance which he 
hears, which he feels, is his, imagining it in all 
sorts of glittering and deceptive circumstance, 
treasuring scraps of others' reminiscence, gain- 
ing hope from misinterpreted detail, indulging 
his fancy with aimless triviality, daring in ill- 
advised effort for he hardly knows just what, 
failing and surrendering himself to the inevi- 
table hold of current life and even death, 
he is not, for us, particularly the young Napo- 
leon, he is merely what he essentially is, 
namely, a poignant instance of the fate that 
stands ready for all humanity. He makes, to 
us, an appeal which, having lost the power of 
a particular patriotism, has the breadth of 
human nature. He becomes one of the great 
characters of literature. 

Most of those who saw " L'Aiglon " in New 
York during the last month had seen not long 
before a new presentation of " Hamlet." Even 
had they not, they would naturally have 
thought of the Prince of Denmark in his suit 
of sable, while looking upon the French prince 
in his Austrian white. Without the pretense 
of comparing M. Rostand with Shakespeare, 



we may still compare the great figure of Eng- 
lish romanticism in its heyday with this later 
figure of French romance. It is perhaps sin- 
gular that in an age preeminent for exuberant 
conception and fulfilled achievement, the great- 
est creation of literature should have been the 
man who thought too closely on the event, and 
kept on living to say, This thing's to do, until 
circumstances took the matter out of his hands. 
Not less singular is it if either be singular 
at all that at the end of a century of unri- 
valled material achievement should come this 
prince who strove to realize his fancies of the 
truth, and failed. 

If M. Rostand gives us no true ending to 
the play, for surely mere failure, mere 
death, though no doubt in this case historical 
enough, is still in its wider application rather 
too simple a solution, it is not, as we might 
think, because he is morbid, pessimistic, 
French. No less sane and optimistic a person 
than a poet laureate of England gave no better 
an ending to his embodiment of Soul at war 
with Sense. King Arthur, wounded to death 
amid the wreck of his great imaginings and 
the ruin of his Round Table, leaving the 
world his mind all clouded with a doubt, is no 
more reassuring a figure than this little prince 
of fairy-land who crawls back from his first 
real brush with facts, to die with reminiscence 
of the trailing clouds of glory with which he 
was born. Neither satisfies one whose heart 
has been aroused to sympathy with the aspira- 
tion and with the struggle. It is a pity, cer- 
tainly. Were Shakespeare at hand to-day, 
perhaps he would kindly show us how the thing 
should have been done. 

Still, the figure is immensely interesting. As 
for the play, for the character does not 
necessarily make the play, one must wait till 
the glamor of a first reading, a first seeing, 
shall have worn away before we can feel at all 
decided as to how permanent or how great 
is its power. But the prospect is encourag- 
ing, and fills one with the anticipation of 
reassured pleasure.

WE have long thought that a large illustrated history 
of English literature, of the type familiar upon the 
Continent, was a desideratum, and have noted with 
pleasure the recent suggestions to this effect made by 
Professor Dowden and Sir Walter Besant. Mr. Heine- 
mann now writes to the " Athenseum " to say that he

Two SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS.* 

The title selected by Mr. Scruggs for his 
recent volume, "The Colombian and Venezue- 
lan Republics," must not be understood to im- 
ply a political or constitutional disquisition. 
The book is principally descriptive, with suffi- 
cient historical narrative to make clear the 
description. It combines in agreeable form 
the most interesting features of a gazetteer 
with the entertainment of a guide book. The 
author aims to place before his North Ameri- 
can readers precisely the elements and char- 
acteristics of scenery, climate, products, people, 
and modes of life, which those readers would 
most naturally seek to read or learn about in 
the two South American republics named. 
This object has been well accomplished. For 
it, Mr. Scruggs had the exceptionally fine op- 
portunity of a prolonged residence as American 
minister to these states. The book evidences 
his special qualifications for such a task, in 
the keen observation which has taken note of, 
the shrewdness which has grasped, and the 
memory which has retained and reproduced 
the conspicuous features of South American 
life, society, and manners, and the capacity to 
portray vividly what has been seen and remem- 
bered. It is plain that Mr. Scruggs is an aver- 
age American, who has interested himself in 
and has here written down those items of gen- 
eral information which are most likely to attract 
the attention and enlist the curiosity of his 
countrymen at home. Few books of this class 
come to us marked with more of the credentials 
of a sympathetic prevision of the subjects which 
are best calculated to suit readers in general. 
So whether it be the topography and scenery 
of the country ; or its natural advantages, its 
soil and indigenous products, its flora and 
fauna ; or the extent of improvements in the 
way of roads, highways, bridges, landscape gar- 
dening, or cultivation; or the style and character 
of its cities, towns, villages, and plantations ; 
or the characteristics, habits, tastes, manners, 
customs, and occupations of its people, as to 
which the inquisitive American seeks further 
information, Mr. Scruggs is ready to respond 
to the requisition. 

Many of the facts emphasized by our author 
are unfamiliar, and often they run counter to 
old traditions even if they do not surprise us. 
The Colombian and Venezuelan coffee, a great 

*THE COLOMBIAN AND VENEZUELAN REPUBLICS. By 
William L. Scruggs. Boston : Little, Brown, & Co. 



staple, is in its highest grade so much superior 
to that used in the United States, that " we do 
not know what a cup of real coffee is until we 
visit our neighbors across the Caribbean," says 
Mr. Scruggs. Tobacco is a native plant ; in 
Bogota and other towns it is universally 
smoked, but not chewed ; and the quality is so 
fine that much of this product is shipped to 
Cuba and there manufactured into " clear 
Havanas." The potato also is indigenous. The 
oxen in the Andes are gigantic, and the native 
horses cannot be made to trot. The mild and 
equable climate of the elevated plains in the 
mountains is exhilarating, and at first seems 
perfect, but it develops its own peculiar ail- 
ments, among which are an early deterioration 
of the normal faculties of the inhabitants, caus- 
ing short lives as a rule, and accompanied by 
a marvellous precocity in the youth. The pe- 
culiar and well-known characteristics of the 
higher classes among the Spanish- American 
peoples are in part due to climatic conditions, 
but are largely racial. In these States, as in 
Central America, miscegenation, practiced for 
centuries between whites, Indians, and negroes, 
has produced several mixed races, which form 
so large a proportion of the population as to 
predominate in some of these States, and to 
indicate to our author that out of them all is 
yet to grow an entirely new " South Amer- 
ican " race. 

A flavor of political science is imparted to 
the book by the interesting and valuable chap- 
ters on the Monroe Doctrine and its operations 
in South America, the Musquito Coast diffi- 
culty, International Arbitration in general and 
the Arbitration of 1899 in particular, Democ- 
racy in South America, Spanish-American 
revolutions, and the Rights of Foreigners in 
South America. The peculiar characteristic 
of the inhabitants which leads them into their 
frequent " revolutions " is diagnosed by Mr. 
Scruggs as an excess of egoistic devotion to 
individual rights, which depreciates the value 
of stability in government and promotes com- 
petitive attempts at individual control. Bolivar 
believed in government, no less than in civil 
rights. But Bolivar was apparently one hun- 
dred years in advance of his fellows, and not 
yet are there a sufficient number of Spanish- 
Americans who share in this cardinal view as to 
the essentials of government to make it certain 
that any " constitution," even the best, can 
permanently succeed in any South American 
State. J. O. P.

NEW TOOLS FOR BIBLE STUDENTS.* 



The three volumes noticed under this caption 
are popular presentations intended to embody in 
systematic and simple form the best results of 
investigations in their respective fields up to the 
current year. Professor Riggs's work begins 
with one of the most tragic periods of Jewish 
history. The Maccabean struggle arouses the 
patriotic instincts of a reader as almost no other 
event in all history. Our author has carefully 
sifted the sources, and discussed with very fair 
judgment the specific value which is to be at- 
tached to each separate document of that age. 
The estimate of the literature and the system- 
atization of the facts gathered therefrom give 
this volume a place quite in advance of Moss's 
"From Malachi to Matthew," or of Fair- 
weather's "From the Exile to the Advent." 
The treatment of New Testament times, while 
fresh and clear, carries the reader over ground 
that is more familiar and consequently not so 
novel and attractive. The author's narrative 
shows that he was familiar with the literature 
of his subject, and that he had the rare gifts of 
being able to weigh in his own mind, and to 
state in good plain popular English, the results 
of his processes. The imagination is also 
brought into play, though not unduly, for ex- 
ample, in his description of the so-called ele- 
mentary schools of Christ's day (pp. 132 and 
238). Josephus's writings are accorded their 
full meed of praise ; and the Roman literature 
of New Testament times is made to contribute 
its share to the better understanding of Pales- 
tine in the first century. The whole plan and 
arrangement of the book is at one with the 
Kent series to which it belongs. It is sup- 
plied with maps and a chart, and contains 
ample topical and text indices. These neces- 
sary appurtenances of a usable book, added to 
the admirable candor and clear narrative of 
the body of the work, commend this as one of 
the very best popular discussions of these two 
centuries of history.

Jesus " appeared in its first edition in 1896. 
Its adaptation to the needs of students of the 
Scriptures has already required the issuance of 
a third edition. The most technical and schol- 
arly portion of the earlier editions, the Intro- 
duction on the Sources of the Life of Jesus, is 
here very properly transferred to the end of 
the volume under the heading " Appendix." 
The author has carefully distinguished between 
matter that is distinctly biographical and that 
which is doctrinal only. By a wise use of titled 
paragraphs, he has set before the reader an 
admirable analysis of each of his seventeen 
chapters. These paragraphs are models of 
expression and of statement of the case as re- 
quired for students. The text is full of refer- 
ences to the New Testament Gospels, and the 
footnotes disclose the fact that the author is 
familiar with the literature of his broad theme. 
Ample indices, both topical and textual, put 
the book at the ready command of the student. 
A couple of maps would add very much to the 
vividness of the narrative of chapters VI.- 
XII. Professor Gilbert is fully abreast of the 
times in progressive New Testament research, 
and gives us here as complete a popular state- 
ment of the case at the close of the nineteenth 
century as can be found anywhere. 

Professor Rhees's " Life of Jesus of Nazar- 
eth " is another contribution to the more valu- 
able discussions of the " Son of Man." The 
work covers substantially the same ground as 
the one just noticed. Its method, however, is 
somewhat different, and its discussion of the 
literature of the theme is a very valuable feat- 
ure. The point of view of the author is shown 
in the fact that he brings before his readers 
the Man Jesus as revealed in the reading of 
the gospels. The incarnation was the revela- 
tion of the divine through human life, and not 
through " a series of propositions which formu- 
late truth." This was the method by which 
the apostles and evangelists arrived at the con- 
clusion that Jesus was the divine Redeemer. 
This method of the author has its manifest 
advantages, chief among which is the constantly 
growing idea of the value and importance of 
the truth and the supernatural character of the 
new Teacher. Professor Rhees's presentation 
of his theme according to this principle is 
highly successful, and leads the reader by a 
very natural ascent from the child at Nazareth 
through the various stages of advance, until he 
sees the risen Man pass from Olivet's heights 
into the heavens. This volume is so attrac- 
tively written and so richly suggestive of a

devoted to the record of the naval struggle with 
Napoleon from 1803 to 1815, and is entirely from 
the pen of Mr. Clowes. Mr. W. H. Wilson having been 
prevented from furnishing his allotment, namely, 
the story of the minor operations of the war. Gov- 
ernor Roosevelt's promised account of the American 
war is reserved for the opening section of the forth- 
coming and final volume of the work. The central 
episode of the present volume is of course the cam- 
paign of Trafalgar, and in his observations upon 
this momentous action Mr. Clowes has some plain 
truths and sobering reflections to present for the con- 
sideration of his countrymen, which we trust will 
not be lost upon them. Recent events have doubt- 
less had their effect in disabusing the minds of such 
Englishmen as are capable of taking a rational 
view of themselves, of the childish notion that one 
Briton is a match for three or four foreigners. En- 
gland has just succeeded in mastering, by sheer 
superiority of numbers, a miniature community 
which could not be seriously reckoned a power at 
all. Mr. Clowes now calmly tells his readers: 
"Most of our great victories have been gained by 
superiority of numbers''; and he goes on to say that 
the victory of Trafalgar was due, not to superior 
foresight or strategy or bravery, but to the pres- 
ence with the British fleet of a sailor of genius, 
whose like England will probably not see again. 
Mr. Roosevelt's forthcoming account of the naval 
actions of the war of 1812 which account we 
sincerely trust will be free from the spirit of boast- 
fulness must also set forth some salutary facts 
for British contemplation. No intelligent person, 
of course, will question English valor, since its 
praise is written in all true history, and its traces 
are manifest in all parts of the globe. But it is 
time for England to put away the silly notion that 
foreigners, qua foreigners, are comparative weak- 
lings whom she has always beaten and can always 
beat in equal fight. The conceit is ridiculous, 
Chinese, and retarding; and it has certainly con- 
tributed to recent humiliation (in the end no bad 
thing, perhaps) and defeat. The lesson of Trafal- 
gar, thinks Mr. Clowes, is (since England cannot 
hope to have a Nelson for each hour of emergency) 



"that Great Britain, instead of relying upon any 
supposed superiority of her sons, and instead of 
trusting to find a Nelson when he is needed, should 
take care always to have the bigger battalions on 
her side. With the bigger battalions, and with officers 
and men as good as those of any other nations, she 
may count on holding her own." Such sober and 
practical words as these are timely at a period of 
restless militarism and boundless aggression, when 
it may be said almost without challenge that 
every considerable power, save perhaps two, and 
certainly one, would regard with satisfaction En- 
gland's definitive humiliation and relegation to the 
second rank a contingency which no thoughtful 
American of English blood can bear to contemplate 
seriously for a moment. Mr. Clowes' volume is an 
unusually interesting number of the work, and its 
illustrations are up to the u*ual high standard. 

Biography of Seldom is a biographer so favored 
Henry George, as Henry George, Jr., has been in 
by M am. preparing the life of his distin- 

guished father. That there should have been jour- 
nals left containing much material, that letters and 
newspaper clippings should abound, that friends 
should be many and admirers and followers a host, 
are of minor consequence when the fact of the 
younger Mr. George's profound sympathy and 
intimacy with the career that promises so much 
for humanity is taken into full account. It is rare 
that two succeeding generations attain such loving 
and intellectual companionship. Almost rarer is 
the feeling prevailing through the book, which has 
scorned concealment of a hundred little things that 
go to show how intensely human were all of Henry 
George's characteristics, foibles, and aspirations 
alike. Born in Philadelphia on September 2, 
1839, dying in New York City in the most 
dramatic manner, still vividly in the public mind, 
on October 29, 1897, Henry George lived a most 
human life, as we see it painted here. No attempt 
is made in this biography to hide the trifling 
follies of youth, the more serious mistakes of 
manhood. On the contrary, the steps by which 
the elder George came to a full comprehension of 
his relations to his fellows is depicted in great de- 
tail, enabling the reader to pass with him from the 
common American indifference to everything but 
worldly success into that better knowledge which 
makes the deprivation of a single citizen the con- 
cern of the entire Republic. The birth and growth 
of the idea which was known later as the "Single 
Tax," and the singular receptiveness of its re-dis- 
coverer to the claims of priority on the part of 
others, are intensely interesting and interpretative 
as told in the younger Mr. George's pages. Food 
for reflection, too, is given by the attitude toward 
university training, which the economist thought 
almost fatal to independence in investigation. The 
style of the biography is simple and clear, with- 
out enjoying any particular distinction, and the 
biographer's self-effacement is to be highly com-

Th 



mended. Alike for its subject and its treatment, 
"The Life of Henry George" (Doubleday & 
McClure Co. ) is a welcome contribution to biog- 
raphy. 

With technical art criticism, Arch- 
er/ '"deacon Farrar's scholarly work on 

" The Life of Christ as Represented 
in Art" (Macmillan) has admittedly little to do. 
The theme is treated from the religious and his- 
torical view-point, and the aim of the author is in 
the main to enable his readers to understand and 
feel the power of those mighty sermons preached 
by the great religious painters to men of their own 
generation, and which to the great mass of men of 
ours are locked in an unknown tongue. In these 
grand works of a devout and believing age lie 
sources of enduring delight and consolation to all 
who can look upon them with the seeing eye ; and 
it is in the hope of increasing the number of those 
capable of this high and improving pleasure that 
Dean Farrar has written. He has also endeavored 
to indicate how the worth and dignity of religious 
painting has fluctuated with the varying sincerity 
of the periods of its production for Art cannot 
deceive, but invariably betrays herself when at- 
tempting to express emotions that she does not feel. 
Dean Farrar's book is the record mainly of his own 
impressions and reflections, and while not always 
convincing in its defense of the thesis that the 
worth of a painting varies directly with the depth 
of the religious sentiment of its producer (a propo- 
sition which seems to leave too far out of the count 
the supreme importance of mastery of technique), 
it is a most valuable aid to the enjoyment of the 
more spiritual qualities of the masterpieces it de- 
scribes. The illustrations, consisting of twenty- 
three full-page plates and a great number of well- 
chosen and instructive drawings in the text, are 
largely taken from the great Italians of the four- 
teenth and fifteenth centuries, the Dutch, Germans, 
and Flemings being less fully represented, and the 
Spaniards, except Velasquez, scarcely at all. A few 
examples from modern painters Rossetti, Hunt, 
Burne- Jones, Millais, etc. are included. The 
volume is an attractive one outwardly, and will be 
especially valued by those who incline to study art 
from the author's point of view. 



impartial views Impartiality which is rightly to be 
of Russia and\ called judicial characterizes Mr. 
the &^ian,. Edmund Noble's "Russia and the 
Russians" (Houghton, M.fflin & Co.). In no other 
book on this vexed topic do we remember noting 
so complete a mingling of the good and bad, leaving 
the reader with a sense of reality and humanity as 
assuring as it is unusual. By far the greater part 
of the American nation regards the great empire of 
the Tsar with frank good will, tempered by a knowl- 
edge of its despotism and illiberally toward political 
thought. This sentiment probably had its origin in 
the kindly action of Russia during the Trent episode 



of our Civil War, strengthened through the lapsing 
years by many other indications of hospitality and 
friendship. The rising in the United States of a 
party confessedly Anglophilic in these later days 
makes it the more needful that the truth should be 
told, to allay the assertions of partisans on both 
sides. This is Mr. Noble's task, and he has ac- 
quitted himself well. In its newness, America has 
many things in common with Russia, and more 
than one change in our recent governmental policies 
has had the Russian flavor. Both nations, as we 
see clearly in these pages, have all the world before 
them in which to choose, with Russia committed to 
a policy which has already outstripped her present 
powers of assimilation, benevolent or otherwise. 
The Russia of Count Tolstoy's recent novel, the 
Russia of Mr. George Kennan, are to be seen in 
Mr. Noble's book beside the land of intense patriot- 
ism and self-seeking which is contesting with Great 
Britain for the supremacy of the world. The book 
is to be highly commended to those seeking truth 
rather than a confirmation of existing prejudices. 

Books relating to the stage are grow- 

s more iQ demand each y ear - 

due perhaps to the fact that the 
natural curiosity of the play-loving public has usu- 
ally been incited by fancies rather than satisfied by 
facts. ' The Theatre and Its People " (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.) is in many respects unlike any other 
book, and may be regarded as a sort of theatrical 
vade-mecum. Mr. Franklin Fyles, the author, is 
dramatic critic of the New York " Sun," and him- 
self a dramatist of no mean skill. His information, 
therefore, comes from the inside ; and to those who 
are unfamiliar with stage life unfamiliar with 
the theatrical business and profession as pursued in 
America to-day the volume will prove interesting 
and valuable. It treats such subjects as the mak- 
ing of actors, theatrical managers, the writing of 
plays, authors' gains and losses, rehearsals, first 
nights, stage fright, life behind the scenes, etc., in 
such a way as to convey a specific knowledge of the 
subject to convey the truth plainly, rather than 
to create illusions or destroy them. When we con- 
sider that there are five thousand theatres in the 
United States counting all kinds, that not less than 
one and one-half million persons sit in these theatres 
each week-day night in a season of at least eight 
months, that seventy-five millions of dollars (a con- 
servative estimate) are paid by Americans each year 
for theatrical amusement, we realize the scope and 
interest of Mr. Fyles's treatise. The volume con- 
tains many appropriate illustrations. 

It has been pointed out that musical 
T biography labors under two conspicu- 

ous disadvantages: the customary 
absence of interesting details in the lives of eminent 
musicians, and the lack of biographers who have 
sufficient literary resources to enable them to use to 
the best advantage such materials as their subjects

afford. Miss Rosa Newrnarch, in her biography of 
Tchaikovsky (John Lane), traces the life of the 
melancholy Russian musician whose emotional and 
romantic despair seemed to belong to other times 
and other lands to echo Chateaubriand and Byron 
rather than Gogol and Tourgue'nief in a manner 
highly commendable. The volume is entertaining, 
notwithstanding the axiom that to write technically 
about music is to render one's self unintelligible to 
all but musicians. Though the best known among 
Russian composers, Tchaikovsky was by no means 
the greatest. It is true that he was " a poet of one 
mood in all his lays," but he was not, like Glinka, 
or in a less degree like Rimsky-Korsakov, conse- 
crated to the service of nationality ; as a result of 
this, his works are popular with the English audi- 
ence, and his death, which occurred six years ago, 
is to be lamented. As a musical critic he was well 
known in his own country ; those extracts from his 
writings which are reproduced in this volume are 
chiefly valuable because they throw some light upon 
his personal tastes and the tendencies which influ- 
enced his music. The " Diary of My Tour Abroad 
in 1888," a modest record of concerts given and 
operas conducted by Tchaikovsky, closes the vol- 
ume. One thing is omitted which invariably 
proves convenient in any lengthy biography an 
index. 

Denizens of our woods and fields 
d en FeatLn r find a worthy advocate in Mr. John 

Burroughs, who, in his " Squirrels 
and other Fur-bearers " (Houghton), recounts his 
experiences with them and their cunning ways. 
His simple tales lend something of a human inter- 
est to the lives of these humble creatures, and it is 
to be hoped that the influence of this book will 
tend to abate the fierce and bloody warfare of ex- 
termination which man so relentlessly wages upon 
them with trap and gun. Indeed, every reader 
should become a friend of all squirrels and chip- 
munks, of the rabbit and the hare, of the fox and 
the mink, and even of the little brown mice. The 
book is limited in scope, in large part, to the per- 
sonal observations of the author on the smaller and 
better known mammals of the forests of the eastern 
part of the United States. But this limit affords 
room enough for a very interesting and most read- 
able book. Fifteen plates after Audubon, and an 
original frontispiece, all in color, adorn the work. 
In these days of many bird books, novelty either 
in subject or treatment is a matter of prime im- 
portance. The birds of English gardens and moors 
and meadows have been the theme of many writers, 
but none, perhaps, has dealt with the subject in so 
original and fresh a manner as Miss Pollard in her 
" Birds of My Parish" (John Lane). This is a book 
of avian small talk, in which the birds themselves 
do the most of the chattering with a wholesome 
disregard of the conventionalities of all well-ordered 
ornithologies. A deal of information about English 
birds and their habits is here presented in a very 
entertaining manner. 



The most utejui Ifc is difficult to realize that " Web- 
single volume ster's International Dictionary" 
Engh,h dictionary. (Merriam) is already ten years old. 
We are reminded of that fact by the appearance of 
a new edition, printed from new plates throughout, 
and embodying a great quantity of entirely new 
matter. Although we have always objected seri- 
ously to the Websterian orthography, it has no 
doubt become largely mitigated by its many later 
concessions to an enlightened taste, and some of its 
vagaries have become in a way mellowed by usage. 
And there can be no doubt that the famous u Dic- 
tionary " is still, as it has remained for many years, 
the most useful one-volume work of its kind in the 
language. The chief special feature of this latest 
revision of the work is provided by the Supplement 
of 238 pages, which is bound in at the end of the 
volume, in addition to the upwards of two thousand 
pages which preserve the general arrangement and 
contents of the earlier edition. This additional 
section, which has been prepared under the direc- 
tion of Dr. William T. Harris, gives us a new 
vocabulary of about twenty-five thousand words, 
which have been treated by a numerous committee 
of the most competent specialists in the several 
departments of knowledge concerned. Here we 
find not only technical, dialectical, and exotic 
words, in great numbers, but also many hitherto 
obsolete words that have been given renewed cur- 
rency by our modern writers. In short, the new 
" Webster " is even more indispensable than ever 
among the furnishings of the office, the library, 
the school, and the home. 

The well printed, generously illus- 
trated book entitled "Historic Towns 

_ . 

of the Southern States (Putnam) 
completes the triad of volumes on American His- 
toric Towns, and crowns an enterprise which can- 
not be too highly commended by all who have at 
heart the interests of American history and histor- 
ical research. If it is possible to pick out flaws 
and inadequacies in this useful little series (which 
we should like to see extended), it is, on the other 
hand, easy to point out merits in it ; and publishers, 
editors, and contributors are on the whole to be 
congratulated on the outcome of their efforts. 
The present volume, which opens with a compre- 
hensive Introduction by Professor W. P. Trent, 
treats of eighteen of the older Southern towns 
Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, 
Savannah, Mobile, New Orleans, Vicksburg, Nash- 
ville, St. Augustine, etc., and is enriched with 
many illustrations selected rather for their historical 
value than for their quality as embellishments. 
Each article is the work of a specially qualified 
wr iter Miss Grace King contributing the one on 
New Orleans, Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip that on 
Washington, Mr. George R. Fairbanks that on 
St. Augustine, and so forth. Professor Trent's 
essay is, of course, thoughtful and suggestive ; and 
the work of the several contributors is creditable

elegant form and pictorial attractions of this useful 
series make it a suitable object of attention for the

Adventure* of ^ n " A Woman Tenderfoot " (Double- 
a woman in the day, Page & Co.) Mrs. Grace Gal- 
Rocky Mountain*. latin Seton-Thompson tells with 
feminine vivacity and a touch of Far- Western 
"breeziness" the story of her adventures while on a 
trip with her husband, the well-known artist-author, 
in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and 
Canada. Mrs. Seton-Thompson, it must be under- 
stood, was not towed along ingloriously as a passive 
spectator in the wake of her adventure-loving com- 
panion, but took an active share in the proceedings 
camping, shooting, mountaineering, "cow-punch- 
ing," or whatever else chanced to be the sport or 
enterprise of the hour. The journey was the note- 
worthy one during which Mr. Seton-Thompson 
gathered material for his popular work, ''Wild 
Animals I Have Known "; so that in the present 
book we get the woman's side of that capital story. 
Mrs. Seton-Thompson has written, she says, " in 
the hope that some going-to-Europe-in-the-summer 
woman may be tempted to go West instead "; and 
so, for the benefit of such members of her sex as 
may be allured into following her example, she 
supplies a chapter of practical directions as to outfit, 
dress, etc. The book is a taking one externally, 
and contains many drawings, full-page and vignette, 
of the right "outing" flavor.

historical biography, the volume this time treating 
of "Napoleon III. at the Height of his Power" 
(Scribner). The book is, like the others, attrac- 
tively written, and there are many well-drawn por- 
traits and interesting extracts from contemporary 
writings, official and private. The period covered 
begins with the year 1860, or the close of the 
Franco-Austrian war over the Italian question, and 
closes with the signing of the Treaty of Pekin at 
the end of the year. There are four portraits 
Pius fX., General de Lamoriciere, Francis II. of 
Naples, and Garibaldi. The good work of the com- 
petent translator, Mrs. Elizabeth Gilbert Martin, 
calls for a further word of praise. 

Good counsel "Counsel upon the Reading of 
upon the reading Books " (Houghton) is the title of a 
pleasant little volume that we take 
pleasure in commending. It is the outcome of a 
course of Extension lectures given in Philadelphia 
two years ago, and differs from most books about 
reading in combining specific recommendations 
with its general advice. Six subjects are discussed, 
in as many lectures, by specialists who know how 
to make their pleas both practical and eloquent. 
Professor Morse Stephens writes of history ; Miss 
Repplier of memoirs and biographies; President 



Hadley of sociology, economics, and politics; 
Professor Brander Matthews of fiction ; Professor 
Bliss Perry of poetry ; and Mr. H. W. Mabie of 
essay and criticism. Thus various points of view 
are presented, and the conclusions reached do not 
always agree, but the discussion is throughout 
urbane, scholarly, and deserving of respect. Mr. 
Perry's paper on poetry seems to us particularly 
deserving of praise, for so much sound doctrine 
combined with pleasant writing is not often packed 
within the limits of a single hour's discourse. We 
should not neglect to add a word of praise for the 
preface, contributed to the volume by Dr. Henry 

Van Dyke. . 

The title of Mr. Cyrus Townsend 

American battle* tj .. i 11 

by land and tea. Brady s spirited collection of war 
stories, "American Fights and Fight- 
ers " (McClure, Phillips & Co.), makes a strong bid 
for popular favor at a time when wars and ru- 
mors of wars are many, and the man of peace, with 
his old-fashioned notions and New Testament 
prejudices, is almost looked upon as out of date. 
The clergy have caught the common infection; 
and even the kindly Mr. Brady, the author of our 
present volume, lends his pen rather to painting the 
romantic and heroic side of war than to pointing 
the stern if unwelcome moral that " War is hell." 
But it would be hardly fair to find fault with Mr. 
Brady for not turning into peace sermons his ring- 
ing tales of the exploits of Jones, Decatur, Barney, 
and Truxton, of Greene, Putnam, Morgan, Stark, 
Wayne, and Jackson. The contents of the book 
are divided into five main sections, Part I. dealing 
with the War of the Revolution, Part II. with the 
Indian war in the Northwest, Part III. with the 
War with France, Part IV. with the War with 
Tripoli, and Part V. with the War of 1812. The 
book is meant for popular reading, and is well cal- 
culated to stimulate patriotism of the sort it appeals 
to. There are a number of illustrations, mainly 

from old prints. . 

Close upon the heels of Mr. Buell's 
noteworthy two-volume life of Paul 
Jones follows Mr. Cyrus Townsend 
Brady's " Commodore Paul Jones," a desirable 
volume in the useful " Great Commanders Series " 
(Appleton). Mr. Brady's spirited book evinces 
care in preparation, and covers satisfactorily the 
main events of Jones's public career. It is written 
from the view-point of an ardent admirer ; but the 
author has satisfied himself through due examina- 
tion of the records that his praises are well bestowed. 
Mr. Brady's animated style and exuberant patriot- 
ism makes his book an attractive one for young 
readers. The volume contains a frontispiece por- 
trait and several explanatory cuts.

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Two new editions of Borrow will bring joy to the 
hearts of Borrovians. The edition published by the 
Messrs. Putnam occupies four stout volumes, rather 
too bulky for comfortable reading, but making a dig- 
nified showing on the library shelf. The editing pur- 
ports to be by Professor Knapp, although in the case 
of one volume, "The Bible in Spain," we see no signs 
of his work. The other titles are Lavengro," " The 
Romany Rye," and "The Gypsies of Spain." Mr. John 
Lane's edition is in five much smaller volumes, not ac- 
credited to any editorial hand, and seeming to be simple 
reprints. " Wild Wales " provides the contents of the 
fifth volume. 

We have already had more than one occasion to praise 
that exhaustive guide-book and rich repository of old 
memories, Mr. Samuel Adams Drake's " Old Land- 
marks and Historic Personages of Boston " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). For the reader who wishes to get at 
second-hand a view of historic and storied Boston, and 
for the tourist who wants a guide to what cultivated 
people think best worth seeing in Boston, Mr. Drake's 
is distinctly the indispensable book. A new and revised 
edition of the work is now issued, containing all the 
old cuts and a number of new ones. 

Boxed together as a set come the five initial volumes 
in the "Riverside Aldine Classics" (Houghton), 
namely, " Evangeline," " The One Hoss Shay," " Snow- 
Bound," " Sir Launfal," and Hawthorne's " Legend of 
Province House." This neat, well-printed, inexpensive 
series is intended to include examples of the best 
American prose and verse. Special attention is paid 
to form and typography, the design being to follow the 
models and abide by the traditions of the older presses 
whose names stand for sound workmanship and quiet 
elegance. Each volume contains a frontispiece. 

The following text-books in German have just been

The American Book Co. publish " A Brief Course in 
General Physics," by Professor George A. Hoadley. 
It is a text- book of the conventional modern type, 
with full provision for such individual work and labo- 
ratory exercises as are within the reach of secondary 
students. The " Elements of Physics," prepared by 
Dr. C. Hanford Henderson and Dr. John F. Woodhull 
for the " Twentieth Century " series of the Messrs. 
Appleton is, on the other hand, somewhat unconven- 
tional in treatment, and prefers to relegate laboratory 
work to a special volume. We welcome particularly 
such departures from custom as the insertion of a series 
of full-page portraits with biographical sketches. Nor 
is the history of the science neglected, but receives 
attention at many points. We commend also the 
special chapter on music at the close of the volume.

book of selections from the Persian poets, entitled 
" The Rose Garden of Persia." The volume is a notably 
pretty one, the gay but not garish decorations in Ori-

ental designs and colors being effective and harmonious. 
The text is handsomely printed on rather thick paper 
of fine quality. 

" Shakespeare's Predecessors in the English Drama," 
by John Addington Symonds, has long been out of 
print, and the new edition of the work which the Messrs. 
Macmillan have just issued will be peculiarly welcome 
to teachers and students of English literature. 

" Wit and Wisdom of the Talmud," a little book of 
extracts edited by the Rev. Madison C. Peters, and 
prefaced by Rabbi H. Pereira Mendes, has just been 
published in attractive form by the Baker & Taylor Co. 
The wit is somewhat far to seek, but of the wisdom 
there can be no question. 

The A. Wessels Co. are the American publishers of 
an English series of small books of popular science, 
two of which have just been sent us. " A Story of 
Bird-Life" is the work of Mr. W. P. Pycraft, and 
" The Story of the Wanderings of Atoms " is written 
by Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir. 

The famous " Characteristics " of the Earl of 
Shaftesbury, edited by Mr. John M. Robertson, are 
published in a handsome library edition by Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. This is the first reprint of the 
work for over a century, and should serve to revive 
interest in a worthy but somewhat neglected English 
prose classic. 

The " Representative British Orations," as edited in 
three volumes by President C. K. Adams, are now 
published in a new edition by the Messrs. Putnam, 
together with an additional volume edited by Mr. John 
Alden. The new volume includes examples from 
O'Connell, Palmerston, Lowe, Mr. Chamberlain, and 
Lord Rosebery. 

" The Supernatural," by Dr. Lyman Abbott ; 
" Salvation from Sin," by the same author; "Straight 
Shots at Young Men," by the Rev. Washington Gladden ; 
and " Loving My Neighbor," by Dr. J. R. Miller, are 
four volumes in the " What is Worth While " series 
of booklets, in addition to those noted by us some 
weeks ago. Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. are the pub- 
lishers. 

" Writing in English," a school-book of composition, 
is the work of Superintendent W. H. Maxwell and Dr. 
George J. Smith, published by the American Book Co. 
The Messrs. Appleton publish " The Art of Writing 
English," a book of more advanced grade than the one 
previously mentioned, the work of Professor J. M. D. 
Meiklejohn. " The Essentials of the English Sen- 
tence," by Mr. Elias J. MacEwan, is a publication of 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

The dainty " Flowers of Parnassus " series, lately 
inaugurated by Mr. John Lane, makes rapid progress. 
Four new volumes have just appeared, comprising: 
Browning's " The Statue and the Bust " and Mr. 
Stephen Phillips's " Marpessa," each illustrated by Mr. 
Philip Connard; Rossetti's The Blessed Damosel," 
illustrated by Mr. Percy Bulcock; and Tennyson's 
" The Day-Dream," with illustrations by Miss Amelia 
Bauerle. 

Editions of Omar still multiply. We now have 
from Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. a handsome volume 
containing the verse translations of FitzGerald and 
Whinfield, together with Mr. J. H. McCarthy's prose 
version, the whole edited by Miss Jessie B. Ritten- 
house. The A. Wessels Co. publish a charming book- 
let containing the FitzGerald quatrains, and, for a 



distinctive feature, the remarks on Omar made by Mr. 
H. H. Asquith two years ago at a dinner of the famous 
London Club which annually drinks red wine and wears 
red roses in the memory of the philosopher-poet of 
Naishapur. 

The annual report for 1898 of the Smithsonian 
Institution is a volume of over thirteen hundred pages, 
and devoted almost wholly to a single monograph, by 
the late Edward D. Cope, upon "The Crocodilians, 
Lizards, and Snakes of North America." So important 
a work as this has not often been found even in the 
publications of the Institute, and naturalists will wel- 
come such an addition to the fundamental literature of 
their subject. 

Among the new books about to be issued from the 
Oxford University Press are " The Oxford Book of 
English Verse, 1250-1900," poems chosen and edited 
by Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch ; " An English Miscellany," 
presented to Dr. Furnivall in honor of his seventy-fifth 
birthday, and contributed to by some fifty authorities 
on philology and early English literature; and " Studies 
in Foreign Literature," being the Taylorian lectures, 
1889-1899, delivered by Messrs. S. Mallarme', W. Pater, 
W. P. Ker, H. Brown, A. Morel Fatio, E. Dowden, 

F. W. Rolleston, W. M. Rossetti, P. Bourget, C. H. 
Herford, and H. Butler Clarke. 

The " Century Classics," a new series of reprints 
begun by the Century Co., are in every way dignified 
and attractive in execution. Each volume has a por- 
trait frontispiece and an introductory essay by a good 
critical authority. The volumes are smaller than those 
of the M, ic mil Ian series of similar scope, and the price 
is lower. The six volumes thus far issued, and their 
editors, are as follows : Bacon's Essays, by Professor 

G. E. Wood berry ; Herrick's Poems, by Mr. T. B. 
Aldrich ; " The Pilgrim's Progress," by Bishop Potter ; 
Defoe's Plague Journal, by Sir Walter Besant ; " The 
Vicar of Wakefield," by Mr. Henry James ; and King- 
lake's " Eothen," by Mr. James Bryce. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, in conjunction with 
Messrs. Methuen & Co., have begun the publication of a 
"Library of Standard Literature," four volumes of 
which are now at band. They are " The Early Poems 
of Alfred Lord Tennyson," edited by Mr. J. Churton 
Collins ; "The History of the Life of Thomas Ell wood," 
edited by Mr. C. G. Crump; Gibbons' "Memoirs," 
edited by Dr. G. Birkbeck Hill ; and an Italian text of 
" The Divine Comedy," edited by Mr. Paget Toynbee. 
Something like forty more volumes are already an- 
nounced for this series, which is likely to prove a seri- 
ous rival to the Macmillan " Library of English 
Classics " and the " Century Classics." 

Still another school history of American Literature 
has come to our desk, the work of Professor Walter C. 
Bronson, published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
While no better and no worse than two or three others 
that might be named, this book has a certain individ- 
uality, based in part upon the author's first-hand study 
of the earlier period, with all the advantages offered 
by the Harris collection at Brown University. His 
discussion keeps in touch with social conditions and the 
general intellectual movement of the century, which is 
a commendable feature. The method is that of the 
essay, with biographies and bibliographies relegated to 
the position of foot-notes. An appendix gives some 
highly interesting excerpts from Colonial and Revolu- 
tionary writings.

A powerful romance of that strange episode in 1786 Shays' 
Rebellion the struggle between the courtly aristocrats and the 
discouraged debtor-farmers. It stirs with the same human prob- 
lem that inspired "Looking Backward." 

An unrivaled picture of early Yankee life. Superb in style. 
Intensely dramatic in action.

IN 

The Heart of the

A realistic romance of the alliance of peace between a pioneer 
maiden and the wild beasts who felt her spell, and of the eventual 
human lover who claims her as his own.

A Christmas Accident 

And Other Stories. 
BY ANNIE ELIOT TRUMBULL. 

I2mo, cloth, $1.00. 



" ' If the effect of Christmas could be depended upon to last into 
summer, this would be a very different sort of world,' says Miss Trum- 
bull. Perhaps it does last far enough to prevent the possibility of a 
critical attitude towards a Christmas story in early autumn. What 
has cold scrutiny of a muggy September to do with the glowing 
activities of the Christmastide ? Let the cruel turn gentle, the miser 
prodigal, and the curmudgeon take on a heart of graciousness, on the 
evening of December 24, we shall find no improbability, moral or liter- 
ary, herein. If it is not so, it ought to be so, and Christmas stories 
may help to make it so. This much for the sketch which gives Miss 
Trumbull's volume its name. Its followers are of varying interest and 
merit, an especial charm attaching to the 'Memoir of Mary Twining,* 
a portrait of a last-century girl in delicately sombre tints. Some New 
England coast oddities are cleverly drawn. Some complex contrasts 
of youth and middle age, less well, because less spontaneously. None 
of the papers, however, are without an engaging quality and a twinkle 
of the eye, so to speak, which make them pleasant reading." Nation.

Pretoria," etc. With portrait of General Hamilton, a colored map, and several plans of battles. 

Crown 8vo, gilt top, buckram, $1.50. 

This hook is a continuation of Mr. Churchill's letters from the seat of war in South Africa, and deals with 
the march of General Hamilton's column on the flank of Lord Roberts's main army from Bloemfontein to 
Pretoria. In consequence of the difficulties of communication, little has been heard of the fortunes of this 
column, which marched 400 miles and fought ten general actions, besides fourteen smaller affairs, and this fact 
gives the narrative a special interest.

enabling him to be present at critical moments." The Academy.

A Weekly Magazine of Contemporary Literature and Thought. 
A Necessity to Every Reader of Intelligence and Literary Taste. 

EACH WEEKLY NUMBER CONTAINS SIXTY-FOUR PAGES, 

In which are given, without abridgement, the most interesting and important contributions to the 
periodicals of Great Britain and the Continent, from the weighty articles in the quarterlies to the light 
literary and social essays of the weekly literary and political journals. Science, Politics, Biography, 
Art, Travel, Public Affairs, Literary Criticism, and all other departments of knowledge and 
discussion which interest intelligent readers, are represented in its pages. 

"THE SIEGE OF THE LEGATIONS." 

THE LIVING AGE will begin, in its issue for November 17, and will continue for several successive numbers, a 
thrilling account of "The Siege of the Legations," written by Dr. Morrison, the well-known correspondent of the 
London Times, at Peking. This narrative is of absorbing interest in its descriptions of the daily life of the besieged 
legationers, and it is noteworthy also as containing some disclosures relating to the inside history of what went on at 
Peking in those stirring days, which are altogether new and of the utmost importance. The unusual length of Dr. 
Morrison's narrative has precluded and probably will preclude any other publication of It on this side of the Atlantic. 
In England it has attracted wide notice.

Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, author of "Robert Elsmere" , 

The New York Times Saturday Review says of this story : 

" Not the novel but the public is to be judged by its reception of ' Eleanor.' We are 
glad to have lived long enough for it, and we feel life to be the better worth living because 
there has come into it a book so noble."

By I. ZANGWILL 

This novel is by far the most remarkable of Mr. Zangwill's works. Unlike most of his 
earlier books, it does not deal with the Hebrew character, but gives a forceful and striking 
picture of the social and domestic life of an English statesman. It is a remarkably strong and 
intensely dramatic work. A stage version will shortly be produced, both in this country and 
in England.

ANEW and extremely beautiful edition of Thomas Nelson Page's exquisite romance. The 
author has taken advantage of the opportunity to enlarge somewhat the sketches of the 
Old Gentleman and of Elizabeth Dale, the charming heroine of the romance. Two more 
delightful characters it would be hard to find in recent fiction than this odd gentleman, with 
his old-fashioned manners and his memories of bygone, sweet days, and his strong opinions on

ITALIAN CITIES

Editors of "Vasari's Lives of the Painters." 2 vols. i2mo, $4.00. 

THE wealth of history, poetry, romance, and art in which the cities of Italy are unique, 
receives fresh emphasis from these brilliant and scholarly volumes. The Italy of the 
present day appears in picturesque relief against its wonderful historic background. Long 
Italian residence and recent travel and research have made the authors intimately familiar 
with both the past and the present of the cities they characterize Ravenna, Siena, Florence, 
Parma, Perugia, Assisi, Cortona, Spoleto, Mantua, and Rome ; and their critical commentary 
on the literature and plastic art, which is a main part of their subject, is at once authoritative 
and extremely personal.

regard it as a valuable contribution to naval literature."

form a perfect biography of the famous sea-fighter, a work which should secure at once, 
and indefinitely maintain, a high position in the literature of its subject."

By RICHARD HARDING DAVIS 

Profusely illustrated from photographs. I2mo, $7.50. 

IN the beginning Mr. Davis throws himself with so much zeal into the graphic telling of his 
story that the reader finds himself in full sympathy with Tommy and his officers. After- 
ward the freshness, ingenuousness and picturesqueness of his recital of his experiences with 
the simple-minded Boers quite carries the reader along with him into a momentary sympathy, 
at least, with these bravely but not at all intelligently struggling people. And Mr. Davis, 
after the flood of South African books has spent its fury, really shows us some significant 
things that no one else had shown us, and teaches us what no one else had taught. . . . There 
is no finer picture in recent literature than Mr. Davis's of the collapse of the Boer power.

TOMMY AND GRIZEL 

6otb Thousand. By J. M. BARRIE i2mo, $1.50. 

T is one of the few, the very few, books of this decade that have within them a promise of 
lasting life. . . . We wonder if Mr. Barrie has not placed himself at the head of his 
craft; no, we scarcely wonder. He may be hailed as the greatest living master of the delicate 
art of fiction. New York Mail and Express. 

THE book is very well written, in the vein of quiet, ironical humor that Mr. Barrie has made 
his own. His sentences rarely close without an illuminating touch rarely, too, without 
a dexterous stab. The man grows before us with each successive stroke. There are one or 
two pieces in the book of exquisite prose. Read the love-scene on page 159 and the follow- 
ing pages, and you shall find the true successor to the man who wrote that song of love in 
"Richard Feverel" or, say, the man who might have written a pendant to that exquisite 
chapter, could he have withheld himself from the delights of over-refinement."

'^fa'&fcA MAGNIFICENT ART WORK^i^ ^.^ 

SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS 

- y By Sir WALTER ARMSTRONG /; y : 

t/lutbor of " The Life of Gainsborough" 

With 70 photogravures and 6 lithographs in colors in one volume. 

Folio, $25.00 net. 

IN this magnificent work Sir Walter Armstrong has produced a biography of the first President 
of the Royal Academy in which Sir Joshua's life is sketched in sufficient, though by no 
means exhaustive, detail, more attention being paid to the characteristics of the man himself 
than to the more or less accidental events in which he was concerned. To this the author has 
added a careful critical estimate of Sir Joshua's art and of his influence both on the English 
school and on modern painting in general. 

In selecting the pictures for reproduction, care has been taken to choose those which most 
fully illustrate Reynolds's development, and to prefer, where possible, less known and less 
readily accessible examples to those in public galleries. The unstinted praise given to the 
author's "Life of Gainsborough" both as far as scholarship is concerned and also on account 
of its exquisite manufacture cannot be denied in an equal measure to his "Life of Sir Joshua 
Reynolds," which is equally liberally illustrated and sumptuously printed.

By ANDREW LANG 

Profusely illustrated with photogravures from original sources. (Limited to 1500

IT is, we believe, as the biographer of Prince Charles Edward rather than as the historian of 
Scotland that Mr. Lang will live in English literature. It must have been a delight to him 
to write this fascinating book, whose " get-up" is as superb as that of its five predecessors on 
Mary Stuart, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, Charles I., and Oliver Cromwell. But the 
great delight of the book is the text. Every page shows the author's deep knowledge and keen 
intelligence ; on almost every one of them there is something novel in the way of fact, explan- 
ation, or illustration. The Athenceum.

LONGMANS, GREEN, & CO.'S NEW BOOKS 



HISTORY OF 

MODERN ITALIAN ART. 

By ASHTON ROLLINS WILLARD. Second Edition. 
With a supplement to the text and 12 additional 
illustrations. 8vo, about 700 pages, cloth, gilt 
top, $5.00. 

Press Comments on Mr. VVillard's Book. 
u . . . contains far more information about Italian artists 
of this century than any other that exists in English." 

Times (London). 

41 The author fills up for the first time, and in an admir- 
able manner, a serious gap in our art history," 

lllustrazione ( Milan ) . 

"An honest and original work, the result of first-hand 
research." Magazine of Art (London). 

"The volume entire is a monument of intelligent indus- 
try and comprehensive research much to be valued." 

Times (New York). 

" He has the field practically to himself, and it will 
hardly pay another to glean where he has reaped." 

The Critic (New York). 

" The book is from beginning to end graphic and interest- 
ing. Its artistic discussions are critical and penetrating." 

New England Magazine. 

" Mr. Willard's book on modern Italian art is a grand 
book and delights me. If I were a reviewer it would re- 
ceive unhesitating and warm acknowledgment of its value, 
for I like it through and through, and, moreover, think the 
subject one of very great interest and importance." Sir 
Wyke Bayliss, Pres. of the Eoyal Society of British Artists. 

STONEWALL JACKSON 

AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR. 

By Lt.-Col. G. F. R. HENDERSON. With 2 portraits 
and 33 maps and plans. Third Edition. With an

THE DUKE. 

A Novel. By J. STORER CLOUSTON. Crown 8vo, 

cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

In this story the author of "The Lunatic at Large" 
finds new opportunity for humorous writing and amusing 
situations. The escapades of the adventurous Irishman 
who plays the part of "The Duke" for a brief space are 
irresistible. The true owner of the title finds the joke to 
which he lends himself somewhat embarrassing in its im- 
mediate consequences, but he eventually extricates himself 
from his difficulties to the general satisfaction.

By STANLEY J. WEYMAN, author of " A Gentleman 

of France," ' Under the Red Robe," etc., etc.

8vo, cloth, ornamental, $1.50. 

" ' Sophia,' his latest, is also one of his best. A delight- 
ful spirit of adventure hangs about the story ; something 
interesting happens in every chapter. The admirable ease 
of style, the smooth and natural dialogue, the perfect ad- 
justment of events and sequences conceal all the usual 
obtrusive mechanism, and hold the curiosity of the reader 
throughout the development of an excellent plot and genu- 
ine people. " Public Ledger (Philadelphia).

duced . . . his matter . . . original and refreshing . . . 
has high interest and value." Nation (New York).

tains and in Asia Minor.

account of the pursuit of game, which every man who has 
handled a gun would like to participate in." Academy.

THE BAKER & TAYLOR COMPANY'S NEW BOOKS 



EXPANSION 

Under New World-Conditions 

By JOSIAH STRONG, author of " Our Country." 12mo, 

cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50 cents. 

A brilliant summary of our relations at the century's 
dawn to other countries, and to the great questions that 
confront the nation under the new world-conditions of 
to-day. The book sparkles with striking and original 
thoughts put in the most captivating way. 

"A shrewd Yankee combination of common sense, business 
instinct and sound moral principle." New York Churchman. 

"Every man with ideas in his head and a dollar in his pocket 
onght to buy and read ' Expansion.' "Portland Oregonian. 



THE TRUSTS 

What Can We Do with Them? 
What Can They Do for Us? 

By Hon. WILLIAM MILLER COLLIER. 12mo, 348 pages, 

cloth, $1.25; paper, 50 cents. 

"A very careful and conservative consideration of the 
trust problem." New York Journal of Commerce. 

" His work is a valuable contribution to the question." 
New York World. 

"This book will enable any intelligent student to compre- 
hend the present situation of trusts in their economic, political, 
and social aspects, and for that purpose to-day it is the most 
serviceable treatise we have seen." The Congregationalist. 



THE REAL DAVID HARUM

trated, 75 cents. 
An identification, with many anecdotes, sayings, and 

characteristic horse stories, together with many pictures 

of persons and places.

Homeville was one David Hannum of Homer, N. Y." 

Buffalo Enquirer. 

MAKING A LIFE 

By Rev. CORTLAND MYERS. 12 mo, cloth, with portrait, 

$1.25. ' 

"Vigor, simplicity, earnestness." The Living Age. 

" If we cannot get young men to read such a book as this, 
the next best thing is for those who have an opportunity to 
talk to them to read it, and such will find it full of illustra- 
tion and inspiration." The Churchman. 

" In these twelve essays, Dr. Myers exhibits the power of 
vivid thought and speech which has made his pulpit popular. 
These discourses on life are full of life themselves, and amply 
illustrated by the facts of many lives/' Outlook. 

"This book will arouse, quicken, and help young people 
to do the best that is possible for them to do. To young men, 
especially, whose ambition is to make the most of themselves, 
this book with its plethora of illustrations, pertinent and apt 
quotations, and wealth of example, will be a genuine inspira- 
tion." Brooklyn Eagle. 



THE SALT-BOX HOUSE

ated, $1.25. 
" Full of atmosphere and reality." Philadelphia Public 

Ledger. 

"A delightfully vivid and sympathetic picture." The 

Living Age.

past which is evidently genuine." The Dial. 



SHORT STORY WRITING 

By CHARLES RAYMOND BARRETT, Ph.B. 12mo, cloth, 

$1.00. 

A practical treatise on the art of the short story, 
designed to present concretely the rules of that art. It 
is a working manual, not a collection of untried theories. 
It tells how to write a story with reference to the re- 
quirements of contemporary editors. 

" Both an interesting and a useful book. While it is con- 
cerned with the special application of rhetorical principles to 
a particular department of literary art, it carries a general 
application that all literary workers may profit by, as in its 
chapters on Titles, Style, and the Labor of Authorship." 
Outlook. 

"The book can hardly fail to be of much practical assist- 
ance to the novice in short story writing." Review of Reviews. 

"A volume of definition, criticism, and instruction. Sen- 
sible and based upon careful and intelligent study. Young 
writers will do wisely to read it and heed it." Congrega- 
tionalist. 

WIT AND WISDOM 

OF THE TALMUD 

By MADISON C. PETERS, author of "Justice to the 
Jew," etc., with an introduction by H. PEREIRA 
MENDES. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

The great bulk of the Talmud discourages the gen- 
eral reader from approaching it, and translations of 
portions of it are rare. It is a rich repository, however, 
of wise, pithy, and witty sayings in passages of from a 
single line to a page or more in length. Dr. Peters's 
compilation places hundreds of these within the reach 
of English-speaking people, and forms an attractive 
reference book of apt and striking quotations from a 
hitherto somewhat inaccessible source. 



RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS 

FOR SOCIAL BETTERMENT 

By JOSIAH STRONG, President League for Social Ser- 
vice. 12mo, cloth, 50 cents. 

This work was prepared as a special contribution to 
the United States Exhibit of Social Economy at the 
Paris Exposition, where it was awarded a gold medal. 
" These new activities are shown to differ from the old in 
their effort to uplift the whole of the man instead of a frac- 
tion of him, and to regenerate society as well as individuals." 
Outlook.

By Miss JANE PORTER. A new and complete edition in one

"There is something about this famous romance of chivalry which 
is necessary to the properly brought up boy and girl. It is as necessary 
as Robinson Crusoe, for while that is adventure, in good measure, 
pressed down and running over, 'The Scottish Chiefs' is chivalry in 
its strongest essence. And boys and girls need a strong dose of both 
adventure and chivalry somewhere early in their literary growth."

According to Documents and Approved Authors 
By P. DE ROO 

Member of" the Archaeological Society of the Land Van Waes and of the United States Catholic 
Historical Society ; Honorary Member of the American Catholic Historical Society of 
Philadelphia. 

Volume I. AMERICAN ABORIGINES 
Volume II. EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS 

Two large, illustrated volumes. 1300 pages. 8vo, Cloth, $6.00 per set, net. 

Edition limited to 1500 printed from type. 

Mr. De Roo has laid students of American history under tribute by this exhaustive account 
ot the Western Continent before its discovery by Columbus. In the preparation of this masterly 
treatise he has not only examined the entire accessible published literature in various languages 
bearing on the subject, but has spent years in the study of innumerable manuscripts embraced in 
the collections of the Vatican and other libraries. He has exposed many an idle legend which 
was thought to have some foundation, and has likewise transferred much that has been deemed 
conjectural to the realm of undoubted historic reality. The work possesses the qualities which 
will render it inestimable to historical students and scholars, and the interest as a narrative which 
appeals to the general reader. 

ONCE MORE IN PRINT 

The Life of Benjamin Franklin 

Written by Himself. Now first edited from Original Manuscript and from his Printed 

Correspondence and Other Writings. 

By Hon. JOHN BIGELOW 

Fourth Edition, Revised and Corrected with Additional Notes. Three Volumes. Crown octavo, 

cloth, $4.50; half calf, $9.00; three-quarters calf, gilt top, uncut edges, $9.75. 
Mr. Bigelow's work is on a novel plan. Taking up Franklin's life in 1775, when the autobiography closes, 
Mr. Bigelow carries the narrative on by quoting from Franklin's letters and writings : " And as few other eminent 
men have written as complete a record of bis own life, the main trouble of the writer has been the fullness of 
material." 

The new (fourth) edition is required by the fact that every new year seems to have something fresh to tell us 
of the subject of this memoir. Like his eminent contemporary and admirer, Voltaire, Franklin's fountain of 
pieces in'edites seems inexhaustible. Scarcely a month passes that does not make its contribution to the fruitage of 
his indefatigable pen. It is is now twenty-six years since the first edition of this memoir was given to the world. 
Time and the public taste have vindicated the artistic principle upon which it was constructed of letting Franklin 
tell his story, and his whole story, in his own way. Franklin was not only his own but practically his only 
biographer; his own account of himself is the one in which the world must always feel most interest; and 
whatever other biographies have been or may be written, there must always be a demand for the Life of Franklin 
as written by himself so long as the English language continues to be a living tongue. At the publisher's behest, 
therefore, the author has undertaken to enrich a new edition of this memoir with whatever fresh material of bio- 
graphical interest the last decade has disclosed, in the hope of leaving it as perfect and complete an expression of 
Franklin's own estimate of himself, of his principles, and of his motives of action as it is now possible to supply.

NEW NOVELS BY WESTERN AUTHORS 

-A SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENT:' 

THE EAGLE'S HEART 

A Story of the West 

By HAMLIN GARLAND. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The New York Mail and Express says : " Mr. Garland gives us as true a historical novel 
as any of the Colonial period or the days of the War for Independence. He presents the 
dignity of the life and its service to the nation. ' The Eagle's Heart ' is a splendid achievement, 
lifted above the rank and file of creditable work by the larger outlook, the deeper insight 
that differentiates the art of fiction from the mere gift of writing novels." 

" ' The Eagle's Heart ' is Mr. Garland's best work considered as a story of sustained interest, strong charac- 
ters and exciting incidents." Cleveland Plain Dealer. 

" I lainlin Garland may be seen at his best in ' The Eagle's Heart.' . . . He has graphically depicted the 
wild life on the Western plains ; he has added a symmetrical and intensely interesting character study of the 
typical plainsman ; and through the whole there runs a dainty love motive. These elements are combined with 
artistic skill." Chicago Tribune.

" ' The Girl at the Halfway House ' is a book of exceptional vitality, a series of swift-changing, kaleidosopic 
pictures of one of the most interesting phases of American life a phase which has passed away within the 
memory, and yet almost without the knowledge of the present generation. It is a broad canvas that Mr. Hough 
has chosen for his pictures, and he draws them in with bold, unfaltering strokes that stand out in clear relief."

By Gen. G. A. FORSYTE, U.S.A. (Ketired). Illustrated by R F. ZOGBAUM. A 
new volume in the Story of the West Series. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 
The purpose of this book, written by a gallant officer who has been a part of what he 
writes, is to picture the American soldier in the life of exploration, reconnoissances, establishing 
posts, guarding wagon-trains, repressing outbreaks, and battling with hostile Indians, which 
has been so large a part of the army's active work for a hundred years. To this work General 
Forsyth furnishes perspective and background by tracing the origin of the regular soldier, the 
popular feeling regarding him, and his relation to politics and the militia, his training and the 
manner in which he has borne the brunt of war at the outset of real war from the inception of 
the Government. General Forsyth's " Story of the Soldier " presents a fresh and thrilling 
chapter of American history.

cruel wrath of the retreating savage, the heroism of the advance guard of the railway builders, and the cutthroat 
struggles of competing lines. He does not deal greatly with statistics, but the figures he uses help make up the 
stunning effect of gigantic enterprise. There is not a dull page in the book." New York Evening Post.

The New York Herald: "Huxley's biography is a book that must endure, not only because of the interest 
of the subject, but because of the manner in which the work has been done. . . . The volumes which Mr. Leonard 
Huxley presents to the world form the most important addition made to biographical literature in this decade. 
His filial piety is as firm as that of another son of a great father, Hallam Tennyson. But he has not the same 
scruples of reserve. . . . Huxley's son has allowed us to see the red blood surging through his father's veins. 
He has suffered that noble figure to reveal itself in its entirety. We know him as he was."

THE TRANSIT OF CIVILIZATION 

From England to America in the Seventeenth Century. By EDWARD EGGLESTON. Uniform with " The Beginners

In thia unique volume the eminent historian pictures the literary, scientific, and other influences which were brought to 
this country from Europe in the early years of our history. He shows the religious ideas which the immigrants of the seven- 
teenth century brought with them and the modification of these ideas. Mother English, folk speech, folklore, and literature 
are presented with an nnequaled richness of knowledge. The moral code and weights and measures of conduct are explained. 
The medical practice of that century in England and in its American developments has never been described as it is in this 
book. It is well within bounds to say that no such book on culture in the seventeenth century has ever appeared in England 
or America.

A Story of School Life and Interscholastic Sport. 
By RALPH HENRY BARBOUR, author of "The Half- 
Back." lllus. by C. M. Relyea. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The success of Mr. Barbour's vivid football story, 
"The Half-Back," showed not only interest in the 
theme but also the author's power in writing a story of 
boys' sport and life with the freshness, vigor, and sym- 
pathy befitting the subject. The story sketches the 
long-drawn struggle of a cross-country run, and the 
training and the exciting competitions in track athlet- 
ics, with glimpses of football and other sports. The 
hero is an athlete but also a scholar, and the larger 
phases of school life are placed before the reader in 
their true values. The fun and varied incidents of 
school life are also vividly pictured, and the variety of 
the book is another evidence of Mr. Barbour's skill in 
story telling. Also by Mr. Barbour,

trated by Frank T. Merrill. 12 mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The earlier years of Jefferson's life in Virginia fur- 
uished a series of romantic episodes of which Mr. 
Butterworth has made most picturesque use. The 
story which he tells is founded upon facts, although 
the unexpected figure of Selim, and the Order of 
the Golden Horse Shoes, might well be taken for 
romance. Mr. Butterworth follows Jefferson to the 
White House, sketching his career with a peculir sym- 
pathy and apt appreciation of the salient lessons of his 
life. The story is a fascinating one, and its value as a 
chapter of American history is enhanced by the ap- 
proach of the centennial anniversary of the Louisiana 
Purchase.

In this thrilling sea tale Mr. Brady tells a wonderful 

story of a hero " who was only a common sailor, just a 

type of the plain American blue-jacket of the beginning 

of our Navy." The story will be welcomed not only 

because Reuben James's life, with its long sea services 

and its share in wars against the French and English, 

forms a romance in itself, but also because Americans 

believe in doing justice to "the men behind the guns."

THE SIEGE IN PEKING 
China Against the World 

By an Eye Witness, W. A. P. MARTIN, D.D., author of 
" A Cycle of Cathay." Illustrated. 81.00. 
To the distinguished President of the Chinese Imperial University, 
Dr. Martin, belongs the credit of being the first to issue a permanent 
record of the perils in Peking last summer. Dr. Martin was within the 
walls of the British Legation during those fateful days, and, confident 
of the success of the allied forces, kept a careful record of events. In 
addition, he devotes separate chapters to "The Emperor," "The Em- 
press Dowager," "The Boxers," " The Rescue and Retribution," and 
" The Reconstruction of China." Besides the graphic character of the 
book, all observations, impressions, and judgments of the author should 
have considerable weight. Dr. Martin has devoted nearly fifty of his 
three-score and ten years to China. 

CHINA'S ONLY HOPE 

An Appeal for Progress by her Greatest Viceroy, Chang Chih- 
tung, Viceroy of Liang Hu. Indorsed by Emperor Kwang 
Su Translated by S. I. WOODBRIDGE. Introduction by 
GRIFFITH JOHN. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 75 cents. 
A book that has made more history in a shorter time than any other 
modern piece of literature. More than a million copies of this book 
have been circulated in China. It is aggressive and startling. The 
young Emperor issued a royal command that it be read, studied and 
obeyed. The effect was immediate. Every influence against reform 
was set in motion. The corrupt officials united to counteract its teach- 
ing. The Dowager Empress was enlisted, and the Boxer outbreak fol- 
lowed. The book gives a wonderful inside view of Chinese thought and 
purpose.

Part I. The Gospels and the Acts (8th Edition). 
Part II. Paul's Letters to the Churches (just ready).

50 cents. 

"Judicious, suggestive, helpful, scholarly, admirable, are some of the 
adjectives that keep running through one's head as he peruses this 
really striking and able translation." The Christian Intelligencer. 

A VALLEY MUSE 

By CHARLES G. BLANDEN. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

Mr. Blanden is well and favorably known in the West for his excel- 
lent verse. He was first introduced to the verse lover through Eugene 
Field's column in the Chicago Record, and during the lifetime of 
Mr. Field began regular contributions to this great daily, which has 
"discovered" many of our best Western writers in prose and verse. 
In a review of an earlier book Mr. Field said of Mr. Blanden's work: 
" A noble dignity characterizes this poet's verses, which are bright and 
refreshing with that indefinable subtlety called ' touch.' " 

ONESIMUS, CHRIST'S FREEDMAN 
A Tale of the Pauline Epistles 

By CHARLES E. CORWIN. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
" Onesimus, the slave whom St. Paul sent back to his master,used to 
be much heard of fifty years ago iu the mouths of apologists for the 
Fugitive Slave Law. Its possibilities as material for a much more com- 
mendable kind of fiction one never imagined till Mr. Corwin revealed 
them. It is a work of decided merit, not only in the plot and its work- 
ing out, but also in the skill with which the author has availed him- 
self of the meager Biblical material." The Outlook. 

THE SPIRIT OF GOD 

By G. CAMPBELL MORGAN. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. Contents: 
Introductory ; The Spirit in Creation ; The Spirit Prior to 
Pentecost ; The Teaching of Christ Concerning the Spirit ; 
The Pentecostal Age ; The Spirit in the Individual ; The 
Practical Application. 

" We believe that such men have a mission for all branches of the 
Christian church. To others it may be given to lead the church out 
into the field of social problems; to still others the duty falls of helping 
to elucidate the biblical and theological problems of our age; but surely 
no speakers and no writers can put Christians generally under greater 
obligations than those who bring a message to that which is deepest 
and best in our personal life with Christ." The Congregationalist. 



VERBECK OF JAPAN 
A Citizen of No Country 

By WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS. A Life Story of Foundation 
Work Inaugurated by Guido Fridolin Verbeck. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Guido F. Verbeck was one of the greatest of the makers of the new 
Japan. He taught in his early years scores of men who became the 
first in the government after the Emperor, and consequently all his life 
had almost unbounded influence with Japan's statesmen iu securing 
toleration of Christianity, in stopping persecutions, in getting wise and 
humane laws enacted, in first proposing embassies abroad and in found- 
ing and carrying on the Imperial University in its early stages, and in 
introducing a national system of education. In the early days, before 
the Japanese could obtain expert advice, he was the government's fac- 
totum. During all of these years he was an active missionary in his own 
home, and became evangelist and preacher and Bible translator. The 
emperor of Japan paid his funeral expenses, ordered his highest officers 
to attend the funeral, sent his soldiers to escort the body to the grave, 
and Japanese money from hundreds of admiring pupils aud friends built 
the memorial over his grave. The book gives a true picture of his life 
as the nursing father of the nation. 

THE CHINAMAN AS WE SEE HIM 
Fifty Years of Work for Him. 

By IRA M. CONDIT, D.D. Fully illustrated, 12mo, cloth, 

$1.25. 

A series of pen pictures of the Chinamen taken at short range by 
one who knows much of his true inwardness. Every touch reveals the 
sympathy of the author with his subject and his evident aim to present 
it fairly. The volume abounds in interesting side-lights seventy- 
eight illustrations lending to it additional interest. The book deals 
entirely with the Chinese in America, the author's opportunities for 
observation being exceptional, inasmuch as he has worked among the 
inhabitants of the populous " Chinatown " of San Francisco for the 
past forty years and more. 

LIFE OF MRS. BOOTH 

The Founder of the Salvation Army. By W. T. STEAD, of 

the Keview of Reviews. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

" That a writer of such genius and extensive study as Mr. Stead 

should feel drawn to prepare this sketch of one so truly beloved and 

highly esteemed by every Salvationist, cannot fail to be a matter of 

personal gratification, as it is also an indication of the lofty purposes 

and great value of what we cannot but venture to regard as an inspired 

life." FREDERICK DB L. BOOTH-TUCKER. 

FORBIDDEN PATHS IN THE LAND OF OG 

A Record of the Travels of Three Wise and Otherwise Men 
to the east of the Jordan River. By the Otherwise Man. 
With Maps and Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
A horseback journey through Bible lands is interestingly described, 
the territory covered is full of deep interest to Bible readers and his- 
tory lovers alike. Not only are scores of prominent scenes in Bible his- 
tory illustrated and explained, but there are many dashes of brilliant 
color thrown into the picture from the Greek and Roman occupation 
of the places visited, and also from the later campaigns of the Cru- 
saders. The pleasing style and the clearness of statement are simply 
delightful, and the interest steadily increases to the very end. 

WRONGS OF INDIAN WOMANHOOD 

By MRS. MARCUS B. FULLER. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 

$1.25. 

" If anything can awaken the just indignation of the world this book 
must do it." The Christian Intelligencer. 

ARABIA 

The Cradle of Islam 

Studies in the Geography, People, and Politics of the Pen- 
insula ; with an account of Islam and Missionary Work. 
By S. M. ZWEMER, F.R.G.S. With maps and numerous 
illustrations from Drawings and Photographs. 8vo, cloth, 
$2.00. 

"This volume(such is the dearth of information on the subject)comes 
at once into the vacant place of an up-to-date authority for English- 
speaking people upon "the neglected peninsula." The comprehen- 
sive scope of the volume covers a still wider range of interest, both 
scientific and commercial, historical and literary, sociological and re- 
ligious, in which the author, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical So- 
ciety, has availed himself of the most recent authorities in supplement- 
ing his personal observation." The Outlook.

By Flora Annie Steel. THE HOSTS OF THE LORD. By the author of "On the Face of

SISTERS THREE. 

A Story for Girls. By JESSE MANSEKGH. With 8 illus- 
trations. Illuminated cloth, size 7%x5%, $1.25. 
Jesse Mansergh is in England what Miss Alcott was in America. 
While the author of " Little Women " has held a unique place, we 
feel justified in saying that Jesse Mansergh possesses in a greater 
degree than any other writer we can recall at the moment, that 
charm with which Miss Alcott won and kept our interest. 

" Jesse Mansergh's books are very widely read in England, and 
judging by the quality of her last one, ' Sisters Three,' they are 
likely to find a large audience in America. Readers will find for 
Miss Alcott's little women worthy companions in the girls of this 
book." Pittsburg Times. 

A GIRL WITHOUT AMBITION. 

A Story for Girls. By ISABEL SUABT ROBSON. With 8 
illustrations. Illuminated cloth, size 7%x5%, $1.25. 
This is another delightful story for girls. Miss Robson's book 
is interesting from cover to cover, and the girl without ambition, 
Kathleen Quested, is one of the most lovable and entertaining 
characters ever created. Miss Robson possesses the art of making 
her people live and her scenes vivid. 

"Isabel Suart Robson's story of 'The Girl Without Ambition,' 
even for a moment admitting that there was one is one that will 
hold the interest to the end. The thread of the story is inge- 
niously interwoven with bright conversations, and well embellished 
by Percy Tarrant's pictures." The Boston Globe. 

THE "MENAGERIES" SERIES. 

Micky Magee's Menageries. 
The Jungle School. 
Animal Land for Little People. 
Peter Piper's Peepshow. 

Four delightful volumes for children. The text in each volume 
by 8. H. Hamer consists largely of the grotesque doings of various 
animals in adventures always amusing, sometimes ridiculous, and 
the fun is happily sustained in the colored plates and other draw- 
ings of that inimitable artist, Harry B. Neilson. 

The large sales of these volumes attest their popularity with 
the children. 

Bound in picture boards, 75 cents per volume. 



CRITICAL STUDIES. 

Demy 8vo, decorated cover, green and gold, 



By OUIDA. 
$2.00. 

Those who knew Ouida's work, "The Waters of Edera," will be 
prepared for some strong opinions in these essays. Marion Craw- 
ford and D'Annunzio, for instance, form good material for Ouida's 
pen, and the article on Mr. Joseph Chamberlain should rouse 
strong interest not only in England, but America. The whole 
series forms one of the most remarkable works that has ever been 
put on the literary market. 

AMONG THE BERBERS OF ALGERIA. 

By ANTHONY WILKIN, author of " On the Nile with a 
Camera." With 53 pictures, 14 Collotype Plates, and 
a Map. Size 6x9, cloth, $4.00. 

This work records and illustrates the wanderings of two Anthro- 
pologists among the two great Berber tribes of modern Algeria 
the Chawia and the Kabyles. The purely scientific results are not 
obtruded upon the notice of the reader, though many of the com- 
mon occupations of the Berber's life, their arts and crafts, are de- 
scribed. Thus, though the purely scientific reader will find plenty 
to interest him, he who is not so purely scientific will find little to 
tire or disgust. 



THE STORY OF THE HEAVENS. 

New Edition Thoroughly Revised to Date. 
By Sir ROBERT STAWELL BALL, LL. D., D. Sc., Lown- 
dean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry in the Uni- 
versity of Cambridge. With 24 Colored Plates and 
numerous Illustrations. Nearly 600 pages, size 6x9%, 
cloth, $3.50. 

"This book is illustrated with twenty-four colored plates and 
numerous illustrations. The author is a well-known astronomer, 
and he has produced a very readable book, which is not always the 
case with books on astronomical science. It is one of the best 
books which we could recommend for use in a library, and it will 
prove valuable to the beginner and the full-fledged astronomer as 
well. It has been vouchsafed to but few men to clothe scientific 
facts in such excellent English and in such a comprehensive man- 
ner as has Sir Robert." Scientific American. 

REMINISCENCES OF OXFORD. 

By the Rev. W. TUCKWELL, M. A. With 16 full-page 
Illustrations. Large crown 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $2.00. 
This book gives a most interesting insight into Oxford "Var- 
sity " life as it was from the early " ' Thirties " to the " ' Fifties." 
The author, during his career at the University, came in contact 
with some of the leading men of that time, and the work teems 
with personal anecdotes of such men as Max Miiller, Dr. Pusey, 
Dr. Jowett, Lewis Carroll, Cardinal Newman, Dr. Arnold, etc.

racy, readable style. It is also notable as being an account of the 
first long and important mountaineering expedition made by a 
woman to high Asia.

THE GENTLE READER. 

Among the many agreeable features of the 
holiday season, now so swiftly approaching, 
there is none more pleasant than the making 
of gifts. The truly human being, who feels 
himself no isolated unit in the total of con- 
scious existence, but rather a creature linked 
to his fellows by the countless ties of sympa- 
thetic association, takes a greater delight in 
preparing holiday surprises for those who are 
dear to him than he does in the anticipation 
of the satisfactions that may reasonably be 
expected to accrue to his own existence. It is 
pleasant to dwell in thought upon the coming 
days of relaxation, with their good cheer for 
mind and body alike, but it is even more pleas- 
ant to make little plans for the happiness of 
others, and to select for them those small 
mementoes which mean so much for the tastes 
and the affections, however slight may be the 
estimate set upon them in the market-place. 
Among these remembrances, the tokens by 
which we express ourselves far more effectively 
than by means of any words, there are none 
more important than books, for there are none 
that are possessed of so much of the spiritual 
or symbolic value that we should always seek 
to embody in our gifts. However limited 
may be our resources, they are sufficient to 
compass the procuring of the richest treasures 
of the spirit as it is revealed in literary art. 
Nor is there need to be ashamed of the setting 
provided for these jewels, for the arts that be- 
long to bookmaking, as distinguished from 
the art of the writer of books, have grown in- 
creasingly worthy of their task, and so cun-

ningly fit the page to the margin, so tastefully 
fit the cover to the pages, so harmoniously fit 
the decoration to the covers, that all the 
aesthetic sensibilities are gratified at once, and 
we marvel that it should be possible to offer 
so much of the product of refined taste at so 
absurdly small a price. 

The majority of books, of course, do not 
meet these conditions, being strictly commer- 
cial products for the consumption of Philis- 
tines ; but the wonder remains that so many 
books should meet them so successfully ; for to 
the book-lover of nice discrimination, after 
putting aside the countless impossible objects 
in the guise of books that are everywhere 
thrust upon his attention, there still remains 
the embarrassment of choice among the really 
desirable editions that offer him so much more 
than mere muslin and paper and print. Would 
he purchase a Shakespeare or a Dickens, a 
Walton or a Boswell, or even so modern a 
classic as a " Marius " or an " Omar," he is 
fairly bewildered by the charms of at least 
three or four editions, each of which seems at 
the moment of examination more wholly desir- 
able than any other. And when the choice is 
reluctantly made, his memory lingers regret- 
fully over the claims of the rejected rivals for 
his favor, leaving him not quite sure that he 
has chosen wisely after all. 

In making these remarks, we have had in 
mind, as chiefly deserving of consideration, the 
type of book-lover whom it was once the cus- 
tom to designate as " the gentle reader." The 
type is an old-fashioned one, but it happily 
remains persistent, although seemingly crowded 
aside by the enormous recent expansion of the 
reading public as a whole. The gentle reader 
is essentially a reader of good old books rather 
than of ephemeral new ones. He is apt to look 
with suspicion upon the celebrities that are 
exploited by publishers and newspapers day 
after day, and to give thanks that he has 
learned to eschew the counsel of these " blind 
mouths," that he has long since found his way 
to the perennial sources of literary enjoyment. 
He is still with us, for his tastes are still con- 
sulted by our purveyors of books, and the very 
publishers who strive eagerly with one another 
for the acquisition of the latest novels by the 
latest notorieties take also good heed to provide 
their lists with reprints of the old established 
favorites. The many libraries of standard lit- 
erature which are so characteristic a feature of 
publishing at the present time surely answer to 
a genuine demand, and that demand as surely 



testifies to the fact that the gentle reader is in- 
sisting that his interests shall not be neglected. 

We had just got fairly started upon this 
train of reflection when we came across an 
analysis of the tastes and the temper of the 
gentle reader so genial and so sympathetic 
that we were tempted to make a forced loan 
for the relief of our own poverty of expres- 
sion. This temptation overcome, we must at 
least make a reference to the article by the 
Eev. Mr. Crothers in the November "Atlan- 
tic," which reveals to the gentle reader his 
own true self, and explains the workings of 
his mind so delightfully that even the reader 
of another sort may come to understand some- 
thing of it, and experience yearnings to be 
himself numbered among the gentle. But if 
we may not borrow from Mr. Crothers, we 
will at least borrow from the Rev. Henry 
Van Dyke, who has recently paid his compli- 
ments to the gentle reader. After dismissing 
the " simple reader " and the " intelligent 
reader " as obviously hopeless, this writer sets 
forth the characteristics of the gentle reader so 
charmingly and with such insight that we at 
once feel sure that he knows whereof he speaks. 

" The gentle reader," he says, " is the person who 
wants to grow, and who turns to books as a means of 
purifying his tastes, deepening his feelings, broadening 
his sympathies, and enhancing his joy in life. Litera- 
ture he loves because it is the most humane of the arts. 
Its forms and processes interest him as expressions of 
the human striving towards clearness of thought, pur- 
ity of emotion, and harmony of action with the ideal." 

But better than any characterization of the 
gentle reader better even than Dr. Van 
Dyke's analysis, is the concrete example offered 
by many a man of letters who has taken the 
public into his intimacy, and helped us to feel 
and to share his delight in good literature. 
Emerson and Lowell, Lamb and FitzGerald, 
were gentle readers of the most typical sort, 
and their success in the vocation was complete. 
When Mr. James Lane Allen interrupts the 
course of a novel to bring in whole pages of 
Malory, we instantly know him for a gentle 
reader. Others, again, seem to have the desire 
to be gentle readers, but the true vocation is 
lacking. Mr. Ruskin was too intolerant of 
opinions not his own to become one, and Mr. 
Frederic Harrison, try as hard as he may to 
get in, is kept outside the sanctuary by what 
may be called the strenuosity of his positivism. 
He makes a valiant plea for all good books, 
but we feel while he is making it that they 
have appealed to his intelligence, and in- 
directly, by virtue of their significance for the

history of culture, and not directly by virtue 
of their quality of deep human sympathy. 

On the other hand, we know FitzGerald as 
a genuine member of the guild from almost 
any random page of his familiar correspon- 
dence. By way of bonnes bouches, and as the 
best possible illustration of our text, let us 
close by extracting a passage or two from the 
letters in which his quality as a bookman is 
most clearly exhibited. 

" I am now a good deal about in a new Boat I have 
built, and thought (as Johnson took Cocker's Arithmetic 
with him on travel, because he should n't exhaust it) 
so I would take Dante and Homer with me, instead of 
Mudie's Books, which I read through directly. I took 
Dante by way of slow Digestion : not having looked at 
him for some years: but I am glad to find I relish 
him as much as ever: he atones with the Sea; as you 
know does the Odyssey these are the Men ! " 

" I wonder whether old Seneca was indeed such a 
humbug as people now say he was: he is really a fine 
writer. About three hundred years ago, or less, our 
divines and writers called him the divine Seneca; and 
old Bacon is full of him. One sees in him the upshot 
of all the Greek philosophy, how it stood in Nero's 
time, when the Gods had worn out a good deal. I 
do n't think old Seneca believed he should live again. 
Death is his great resource. Think of the rococosity of 
a gentleman studying Seneca in the middle of February 
1844 in a remarkably damp cottage." 

" I cannot get on with Books about the Daily Life 
which I find rather insufferable in practice about me. 
I never could read Miss Austen, nor (later) the famous 
George Eliot. Give me People, Places, and Things, 
which I don't and can't see; Antiquaries, Jeanie Deans, 
Dalgettys, &c. As to Thackeray's, they are terrible; 
I really look at them on the shelf, and am half afraid 
to touch them. He, you know, could go deeper into 
the Springs of Common Action than these Ladies: 
wonderful he is, but not Delightful, which one thirsts 
for as one gets old and dry." 

" Of course the Man must be a Man of Genius to 
take his Ease: but, if he be, let him take it. I suppose 
that such as Dante, and Milton, and my Daddy, took it 
far from easy: well, they dwell apart in the Empyrean; 
but for Human Delight, Shakespeare, Cervantes, 
Boccaccio, and Scott." 

It is worth while to be able to read books in 
the spirit of the writer of these passages, worth 
while even at the expense of a few crotchets 
and a certain amount of irrationality. And it 
is also worth while to learn the lesson of 
FitzGerald's absolute sincerity in stating his 
likes and dislikes. If our personal judgments 
are in line with the established verdict of 
criticism, well and good ; but if they are not, 
there is no virtue in pretending to the contrary. 
The gentle reader, at least, whatever his faults, 
knows the things he likes, and they are pretty 
apt to be the things that the world has agreed 
with him in liking.

RECORDS or COLONIAL TIMES AND 
MANNERS.* 



Books on Colonial times continue to appear, 
and of such good ones as Miss Helen Evertson 
Smith's " Colonial Days and Ways," now be- 
fore us, there can hardly be too many. Readers 
of Marion Harland's popular " Colonial Home- 
steads " may remember her account of the rich 
accumulation of family papers, " hampers, 
corded boxes, and trunks full of them," stored 
away for generations in the spacious garret of 
a certain old mansion, the Smith homestead, 
at Sharon, Connecticut. These papers, includ- 
ing many thousands of letters, with diaries, 
legal writings, account-books, and so on, form 
a ramifying chronicle covering the years ex- 
tending from the landings of the earlier immi- 
grants in Massachusetts and Connecticut, down 
to the middle of the present century. In ex- 
ploiting these documents, some of which turn 
out to be of rather exceptional historical or 
pictorial value, Miss Smith has lent her pen, 
not merely to the naturally congenial task of 
compiling the annals of the Sharon branch of 
the extensive house of Smith, but also to the 
more weighty and useful one of constructing, 
on the ex pede Herculem principle, from the 
memorials of a representative family a general 
picture of the domestic ways and economy of 
the class of Colonial society to which the family 
belonged. Nor has Miss Smith been content, 
like some of her predecessors, with merely 
skimming the cream of her material, and mak- 
ing a book of extracts. 

Coming of composite English-Dutch-Hugue- 
not stock, the author's ancestral papers reflect 
by turns something of the ways of each of 
these three components of our early popula- 
tion, and not of the Puritan element alone. 
The narrative proper begins with Chapter 
III., mainly an account of a pioneer pastor of 
Wethersfield, Connecticut, and containing, as 
the piece de resistance in the way of quota- 
tions, a letter written in 1698, descriptive of 
early days in Wethersfield. The father of the 
writer was a non-conforming clergyman who 
left England in 1636 to escape " ye infamous 
Laud and ye Black Tom Tyrante" (Went-

worth). Trying times awaited the good man 
in his new pastorate. His son writes : 

" Concerning of ye earlie days, I can remember but 
little save Hardship. My Parents had broughte bothe 
Men Servants and Maid Servants from England, but 
ye Maids tarried not but till they got married, ye wch 
was shortly, for there was great scarcity of Women in 
ye Colonies. . . . Ye firste Meetinge House was solid 
mayde to withstands ye wicked ousaults of ye Red 
Skins. Its Foundations was laide in ye feare of ye Lord, 
but its Walls was truly laide in ye feare of ye Indians, 
for many & grate was ye Terrors of em. I do mind 
me y't alle ye able-bodyed Men did work thereat, & ye 
olde and feeble did watch in turns to espie if any Salv- 
ages was in hidinge neare & every Man keept his Musket 
nighe to his hande. . . . My Father ever declardt 
there would not be so much to feare if ye Red Skins 
was treated with such mixture of Justice and Authority 
as they eld understand, but iff he was living now he 
must see that wee can do naught but fight em & that 
right heavily. After ye Red Skins ye grate Terror of our 
lives at Weathersfield & for many yeares after we had 
moved to Hadley to live, was ye Wolves. Catamounts 
was bad eno' & so was ye Beares, but it was ye Wolves 
yt was ye worst." 

The writer artlessly concludes that the " younge 
hatred rising in my Bloode " in later years of 
Red Skins, catamounts, wolves, and so on, " is 
not a Sin because God mayde em to be hated." 

In Chapter IV. the author turns to the rec- 
ord of the voyage of the " Abigail," a slow- 
sailing craft which followed in the wake of the 
44 Mayflower," bringing several passengers of 
distinction, among them the second John 
Winthrop. With Winthrop came his wife's 
elder sister, Mrs. Margaret Lake; and it is 
mainly to the fortunes of Mrs. Lake and her 
immediate descendants, the Gallups of New 
London County, that this chapter, headed " A 
Pioneer Home in Connecticut," is devoted. 

In Chapters V. and VI. the author turns to 
the records of the comparatively easy and 
prosperous life of the honest Dutch burghers 
of New Amsterdam in 1698. Two notable 
old houses of New Amsterdam are minutely 
described, on the authority of a witness who 
had been familiar with them in his youth ; and 
Chapter VI. tells in detail and most entertain- 
ingly of the " Cares of the Huysvrow " a 
notable person, be it said, who carried on under 
her own roof-tree a sort of complex plant or 
manufactory for the making of nearly every- 
thing needed by the family and its retinue of 
retainers and colaborers. Says Miss Smith : 
" When reading, as one occasionally does in our day, 
of some ' wonderful woman ' who superintends a fac- 
tory, or carries on some other line of equally active 
business, we should remember that very likely her 
grandmother once had as much responsibility, and 
filled it as well, without having to go beyond the bounds 
of her own house to do so." 



Chapters VII., VIII., and IX., describing 
the Huguenot settlers in New Rochelle, are 
among the best in the book. The writer is 
plainly touched by the tale of the plaintive 
fortunes of these exiles, who bore a hard fate 
with a gayety and a fertility of resource 
peculiarly their own. A letter of 1704 gives 
a touching picture of a band of these pious 
refugees on their way to church in New York, 
twenty miles away for it was twenty years 
after the coming of the first Huguenot set- 
tlers to New Rochelle, before the colony could 
spare the money for a church and pastor of 
its own. 

" Every week I see the Huguenots pass the house in 
troops on their way to church in the city. As they pass 
here all have lunch bags or baskets and also their shoes 
on their arms. Yet they are not bare-footed, for they 
are all provided with wooden shoes, such as the peas- 
ants wear in France and in the Low Countries. When 
they reach a stream not far from the church where 
they have erected a shed, they all stop and such of 
them as have other shoes change them before going on ; 
the others wash their feet and their wooden shoes and 
put them on again. They are all very plainly dressed, 
but some of them are very elegant looking persons 
with most charming manners. As they pass they are 
singing some of their psalms, that is, the psalms of 
David, translated into the French. Some of the airs 
are very grand and spirit-stirring, but many of them 
are as sad as dirges, and why should they not be ? For 
surely this people have suffered much. Still they are 
nearly always smiling and happy. But to think of 
walking forty miles in going to and from church every 
Lord's Day 1 I am afraid my Christianity would never 
be equal to that." 

An outcast from his native land, and not, 
like most of his neighbors, a voluntary colonist, 
the Huguenot willingly cut the ties that bound 
him to the Old World, transferring gratefully 
to the land of his adoption the inborn and 
long-tried loyalty of his nature, and ceasing 
to speak his own language as speedily as pos- 
sible. French names, Christian names and 
surnames, became in many cases fearfully and 
wonderfully changed. The musical De la 
Vergne, for instance, was presently written as 
one word, and pronounced Dillyuarje; while 
the elegant and chivalrous Bonne Passe, after 
passing through the uncouth forms of Bunpas 
and Bumpus, was finally degraded into Bump ! 

The children of the Huguenot settlers, it is 
pleasant to note, were treated with a gentleness 
and indulgence then hardly known among 
families of English or even of Dutch descent. 
Innocent sports and amusements were encour- 
aged, gayety of heart and lightness of deport- 
ment were fostered, and 44 the graces " were 
inculcated through little games, jeux de cour-

toisie, one of which, called " La Loi des Bais- 
ers" our author pleasantly describes. 

" In this game only girls were allowed to play. One 
of them stood in the centre of a room, and round her 
passed a decorous procession of little women, each one 
of whom bowed and courtesied low before the gracious 
' reigning lady,' kissing her extended hand and chanting 
' La main ! La main, Jolie ! Petite ! 

Pour les amis. Pour lea amis.' 

To each the small lady in the centre courtesied with 
more or less of grace, and responded, the friends in 
this case being supposed to be of the opposite sex: 

' Merci, merci ; mes bons amis.' 

At the next round the ' reigning lady ' presented her 

brow to be kissed by all in turn, while the chant now ran: 

' Le front ! Le front ! Le noble front ! 

Pour les peres, et les freres.' 

To this the response was a lower courtesy and the 
words: 

' Mon cher papa ! Mes freres che'ris.' 

At the third turn of the procession the small lady pre- 
sented both her hands and her cheeks, while the chanted 
words were: 

' La joue ! La joue ! La rougeante joue ! 
Pour les douces soeurs, et les meres.' 

In this the kissing was mutual, and on both cheeks, 
without further words. At the fourth round the reign- 
ing lady ' was seated, demurely placing one small finger 
on her archly pouting lips, while the others passed by, 
each with half-averted face and one hand raised as if 
prohibiting a nearer approach, while chanting: 
' La bonche ! La bouche, si ravissante ! 
Pour les maris ! Mais seulement les maris ! ' " 

Outwardly less cheerful than his Huguenot 
co-religionists, the Puritan colonist had, as we 
know, his seasons of large indulgences in the 
good things of life witness the following 
extract from a letter of 1779 describing a 
Thanksgiving dinner. The arrangements were 
on a Gargantuan scale. 

" All the baking of pies and cakes was done at our 
house & we had the big oven heated and filled twice 
each day for three days before it was all done, & 
everything was good, though we did have to do without 
some things that ought to be used. ... Of course we 
could have no Roast Beef. None of us have tasted Beef 
this three years back, as it all must go to the Army, & 
too little they get, poor fellows. But, Nay quitty maw's 
Hunters were able to get us a fine red Deer, so that we 
had a good Haunch of Venisson on each table. These 
were balanced by huge Chines of Roast Pork at the 
other ends of the Tables. Then there was on one a 
big Roast Turkey & on the other a Goose, & two big 
Pigeon Pasties. Then there was an abundance of good 
Vegetables of all the old sorts & one which I do not 
believe you have yet seen. ... It is called Sellery & 
you eat it without cooking. . . . Our Mince Pies were 
good. . . . The Pumpkin Pies, Apple Tarts & big 
Indian Puddings lacked for nothing save Appetite by 
the time we had got round to them. There was no 
Plumb Pudding, but a boiled Suet Pudding, stirred 
thick with dried Plumbs and Cherries, was called by 
the old Name & answered the purpose. ... It was 
extraordinary good." 

It remains to be added that the company 



"did not rise from the Table" until after 
dark (one wonders how they were able to rise 
at all), and that the sole drawback to the 
feast was the arrival of the oranges (brought 
in saddle-bags) in a frozen and quite untropi- 
cal condition. " We soaked the frost out in 
cold water," says the writer, " but I guess 
they wasn't as good as they should have been." 
Probably not. 

But we must now desist from our perhaps 
too liberal poachings on Miss Smith's enter- 
taining and instructive pages. The book is 
distinctly one that the student of Colonial 
manners should read, and the publishers have 
done their best to make it outwardly attrac- 
tive. The frontispiece is a pretty drawing of 
the Sharon homestead, and the decorations, 
by Mr. T. Guernsey Moore, are tasteful and 
not cumbersome. E. G. J. 



HONOBK DB BALZAC.* 



The illustrious writer whose name appears 
at the head of this article was born in the city 
of Tours, France, in the year 1799, and died 
at the comparatively early age of fifty-one. 
He belongs to the splendid group of great 
men who made the beginning and first half of 
the nineteenth century memorable in a way 
that only few half-centuries can rival. In 
Germany, Goathe was completing the work 
which has taken its place with the greatest 
work done by any man or in any time ; in 
England, Walter Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, 
Shelley, and Coleridge, were giving expression 
to the new spirit which was transforming the 
literature of their country ; in his own land, 
Balzac enjoyed the friendship of Victor Hugo 
and George Sand. He was himself one of 
those great laborers in his chosen field, whose 
full measure is not taken by the generation 
that produces them, but whose adequate appre- 
ciation belongs to later times which can see 
them aright. 

The family of Balzac was in comfortable 
circumstances, and in a fair way to do for him 
whatever was needed for his best development. 
He does not appear to have been a model 
student at the school to which he was sent, 
and his clerical preceptors seem to have suc- 
ceeded but ill with the young boy, for he

returned to his home in a state of complete 
nervous exhaustion. He had read extensively 
in the books that pleased him, and showed 
considerable precocity of mind and heart, 
since he wrote, at this early age, a "Treatise 
on the Will," which one of his teachers incon- 
tinently threw into the fire. Balzac, in his 
novel of " Louis Lambert," gives a curious 
exposition of his mental and moral condition 
at this time. Under the judicious care of his 
mother, his health was restored, and his ambi- 
tions were greatly stirred by the removal of 
the family to Paris in 1814. There he listened 
to the instruction of Guizot, Villemain, and 
Cousin, and the public libraries and book- 
stalls found in him an ardent visitor and devo- 
tee. He was intended for the law, pursued 
the necessary studies, and passed the regular 
examinations. At twenty-one he was a singu- 
larly promising young man, from the ordinary 
practical point of view. His father now wished 
him to enter upon the real exercise of his pro- 
fession ; but after much consideration he was 
allowed the privilege of making a trial of his 
powers in the way of literature. He was 
ensconced in an attic in Paris, given a meagre 
income, and permitted to go on his way undis- 
turbed. He wrote a tragedy called " Crom- 
well," which his family, and a certain professor 
called in to assist at the reading, condemned 
forthwith. He was taken back home ; but the 
freedom of the life which he had led, and the 
absence of a favorite sister, who was now 
Madame Surville, made him long for the attic 
which he had abandoned. He shortly left 
home for good, and definitely undertook the 
career which gave the world his " Human 
Comedy " and him a place in literary history 
which has become more and more distinguished 
with the passage of the years. 

Balzac's earlier work fell in that period of 
intense romanticism which swept every writer 
into its irresistible current. The eighteenth 
century had been an age of reason, an imper- 
sonal search for truth, social and political. 
With Rousseau came the reaction, the assertion 
of individuality in all regions of thought and 
life. Foreign literatures brought their con- 
tributions to this great stream which bore 
older structures to apparent ruin in its tumult- 
uous rush, Spain with her ballads, England 
with her historical novels, Germany with her 
heroes of revolt. Balzac brought his slender 
offering of sensational romances. They are 
stories which he was afterwards glad to ignore, 
and with which even his warmest admirers do 



not find it necessary to become familiar. These 
were, however, years of growth and develop- 
ment, and helped to lay the foundations of the 
real achievements which were to come; and 
finally, in the year 1829, appeared the 
"Chouans," which brought him success, and 
his apprenticeship was fairly over. Balzac 
was on the way to the profound study of man 
and the society in which he has his being, that 
gives character and quality to the mature 
novels, and has in it the elements of a realism 
fitted to bear remarkable fruit among his suc- 
cessors. 

He had, during these years, entered upon 
business enterprises, which appeared to him 
promising but left him with a burden of debt, 
heavy and harassing. He found his way to 
many and various friendships with the great 
of his time. His displayed the contradictory 
characteristics which are not absent from the 
men of his period and nation. He was a good 
hater as well as lover, desired the possession 
of wealth, which he made wild attempts to 
secure by commercial enterprise or specula- 
tion, became a collector of pictures and curios, 
traveled extensively, and touched life at all 
points. Near the close of his career he married 
Madame Ilanska, with whom he had long 
been acquainted, and who became known to 
him through a correspondence which she 
opened with some inquiries about his book, 
" Le Peau de Chagrin." Romanticist and 
realist, sensuous and spiritual-minded, dreamer 
and scientific observer, indefatigable and in- 
temperate toiler, Balzac truly lived only in the 
creation of those stories which were separate 
chapters in the great work which he had 
planned, and which indeed took all humanity 
for its province. 

The history of these writings is one of con- 
stantly increasing vogue and appreciation, not 
only in his own country but in all lands. 
Translation on translation has made its ap- 
pearance in English, although the difficulty of 
a satisfactory rendering might well give the 
most courageous pause. Some twenty years 
ago, Miss Katharine Prescott Wormley made 
a beginning in this country, and she has found 
it necessary practically to go through the entire 
list. Other translations have appeared, in En- 
gland, and now we have the present American 
edition, with copious introductions under the 
editorship of Prof. W. P. Trent of Columbia 
University. It may be said that twenty years 
ago the name of Balzac outside of France 
awoke but a feeble echo of surprise and won-

derment ; to-day his is no longer a reputation 
confided to the fostering care of scholars and 
eager students of literatures other than their 
own. He has entered into his kingdom, and 
made captive readers in all lands and climes. 

The opinions about him are in the nature of 
the case widely different. Professor Dowden 
says of him : " There is something gross in 
Balzac's genius ; he has little wit, little deli- 
cacy, no sense of measure, no fine self-criticism ; 
... he piles sentence on sentence, hard and 
heavy as the accumulated stones of a cairn. 
Did he love his art for its own sake ? It must 
have been so ; but he esteemed it also as an 
implement of power, as the means of pushing 
towards fame and grasping gold." On the 
other hand, Taine places him with Shakes- 
peare ; in a recent article Professor Harry 
Thurston Peck has said that " at the last his 
name will be placed higher still than Shake- 
speare's, at the very apex of the pinnacle of 
fame " ; and Professor Trent gives him a posi- 
tion but little below this. 

Balzac's literary production, during his brief 
twenty years of real activity, was most extraor- 
dinary. It is impossible here even to mention 
his undisputed masterpieces, but such books as 
"Le PereGoriot," "Eugenie Grandet," "Cesar 
Birotteau," " Le Cousin Pons," " La Cousine 
Bette," " La Duchesse de Langeais," " Le Peau 
de Chagrin," " La Recherche de L'Absolu," 
" Seraphita," " Le Medicin de Campagne," 
come immediately into one's consciousness. 
They seem to span the entire field of human 
life, to penetrate its depths, to ascend its 
heights, to give a reproduction singularly like 
the original. The characters that people the 
world which has arisen under this Prospero's 
wand have a reality that is wonderful ; the ex- 
periences through which they move have a 
vividness that is as remarkable ; the catas- 
trophes that ensue through their weaknesses 
and misadventures, which are seen in full pro- 
portion and consequence in the strong light 
that is one of the romancer's chief gifts, are 
appalling. He has the naturalist's power of 
burying himself in the individual whom he is 
studying ; he analyzes his subjects with an as- 
surance that leaves nothing undiscovered. He 
has the impartiality which a creator must have ; 
these men and women grow and move and live ; 
they are observed with keen accuracy as they 
plan and act and develop ; they pursue their 
own ends, and are confronted by the destinies 
which they have woven for themselves. 

But we come now to the novelist's great 



achievement, which, in the Preface to the 
" Human Comedy," he has announced as his 
main endeavor, and which Professor Trent 
calls " the principal of coordination in fiction." 
These personages were to be seen in organic 
relation with each other, in vital connection 
with the social environment which so profoundly 
acted upon them. This is a very different affair 
from the reappearance in a later book of men 
and women who have had their entrance in an 
earlier one. It is a study of society as a whole, 
of the evolution of character in the milieu 
which has so much to do with its formation ; it 
is a bold anticipation of views and doctrines 
that have had their authoritative exposition 
elsewhere and later. It is perhaps not out of 
place here to give a quotation from Balzac's 
preface to his " Human Comedy " in which he 
sums up his intentions : 

" It was no small task to depict the two or three 
thousand conspicuous types of a period; for this is, in 
fact, the number presented to us by each generation, 
and which the Human Comedy ' will require. This 
crowd of actors, of characters, this multitude of lives, 
need a setting if I may be pardoned the expression, 
a gallery. Hence the very natural division, as already 
known, into Scenes of Private Life, of Provincial Life, of 
Parisian, Political, Military, and Country Life.* Under 
these six heads are classified all the studies of manners, 
which form the history of society at large, of all its fails 
et gestes, as our ancestors would have said. These six 
classes correspond, indeed, to familiar conceptions. 
Each has its own sense and meaning, and answers to an 
epoch in the life of man. . . . My work has its geog- 
raphy as it has its genealogy and its families, its places 
and things, its persons and their deeds; as it has its 
heraldry, its nobles and its commonalty, its artisans and 
peasants, its politicians and dandies, its army, in 
short, a whole world of its own." 

What is to be said finally of this immense 
work? Has the author succeeded in his en- 
deavor ? To have made the effort and conceived 
the plan are in themselves remarkable achieve- 
ments. To have in his day vigorously placed 
himself side by side with the famous Geoffry 
Saint Hilaire, espoused the cause of evolution, 
and illustrated it in his stories, is a high thing 
for any man to have done. But are these figures 
genuine types of human thought and aspiration, 
universally recognized and recognizable, as 
Ulysses unquestionably is, as Hamlet and Faust 

* The " Human Comedy " (an appellation which of course 
suggests the " Divine Comedy") ia divided into three main 
sections, viz.: The "Studies of Manners" ("Etudes de 
Mojurs"), the "Philosophical Studies" ("Etudes Philoso- 
phiques"), the "Analytical Studies" ("Etudes Analy- 
tiques"). These are respectively the moral, metaphysical, 
psychological sections of the work. The divisions in the text 
are divisions of the " Studies of Manners." No translation 
of the "Analytical Studies" is given in the present edition. 
these not being strictly fiction.

are ? Is this the world of free humanity, high, 
pure, and simple, which we find in the best 
art that is known to us? Let the genera- 
tions of readers who are in store for Balzac 
answer. 

The present edition, which includes all Bal- 
zac's novels that are worthy of preservation, 
has the advantage of the editorial supervision 
of Professor Trent, who furnishes a long and 
scholarly biography of Balzac, a suggestive 
plan for reading the interconnected stories, a 
bibliography, and a special introduction to each 
volume. Professor Trent has never done work 
which more deserves the appreciation of his 
readers. The volumes are tastefully printed 
and bound, the illustrations are admirable, and 
the edition ought greatly to increase the inter- 
est in Balzac and enlarge the number of his 

audience.

THE PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE HAGUE.* 

One of the most able and influential of the 
delegates to the Peace Conference at the 
Hague, Dr. Frederick W. Holls, has just 
published an interesting and valuable history 
of the proceedings of the Conference. Twenty- 
six nations sent delegates and each nation sent 
as its representatives its ablest diplomats, 
statesmen, and publicists. The questions 
debated were weighty and momentous. A 
foundation was laid, as never before, for the 
adjustment of differences between nations by 
peaceful arbitration ; and in case war came, it 
was sought to deprive it of some of its horrors 
and to safeguard the life and property of neu- 
trals and property not contraband of war upon 
the high seas. 

The rescript of the Emperor of Russia call- 
ing for the assembling of delegates from all 
the civilized nations, mentioned especially the 
limiting of the increase of armies and of the 
use of new and improved machines for the de- 
struction of human life. It soon became evi- 
dent, however, from positions taken by various 
delegates of the larger powers, that nothing 
could be effected in the direction of disarma- 
ment the matter which evidently the Em- 
peror of Russia had especially in mind. The 
date for this radical departure has not come. 
The time of the Conference was therefore 

*THE PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE HAGUE, and its Bear- 
ings on International Law and Policy. By Frederick W. 
Holls, D.C.L. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



devoted mostly to two topics, Arbitration and 
International Law, and in each of these direc- 
tions sufficient was accomplished to make the 
meeting one of the great landmarks in the his- 
tory of mankind, and one of the events which 
will make the century illustrious. 

International Arbitration has not heretofore 
been a judicial proceeding, and the findings of 
arbitrators have oftentimes carried but little 
weight. The reason is plain. The arbitrators 
were chosen by the disagreeing powers as attor- 
neys rather than judges. Each arbitrator strove 
to obtain all possible advantages for the nation 
that he represented. 

Under the method of procedure fixed by the 
Conference each nation may appoint four of 
its citizens as permanent judges of the High 
Court of Arbitration, and the appointments 
will be made from among its most eminent 
men. From these judges the litigant nations 
will select such number as may be agreed upon 
to hear and determine the questions at issue. 
This tribunal will be the most august in the 
history of the nations ; from its entire impar- 
tiality its decisions will command universal 
respect and no sympathy could be expected 
toward any nation ignoring its awards. 

International Law, a much used term, prior 
to the assembling of the Hague Conference had 
in reality been nothing more than " a miscel- 
laneous collection of moral precepts and rules 
of intercourse." From Grotius to our own 
time many able writers have expounded it, but 
in time of war any nation felt itself free to 
disregard such precepts as seemed to conflict 
with its own immediate interests. By the ac- 
tion of the Conference the chief principles of 
International Law have been embodied in a 
treaty which has since been ratified by and be- 
tween the twenty-six nations represented, and 
thus is the most widely approved and binding 
statute enacted in the history of the world. 
As the author states it, this action is the Magna 
Charta of International Law. It will be the 
starting point for all development and com- 
mentary hereafter. 

The proceedings of diplomatic conferences 
are usually secret, but in the readable story as 
told by Dr. Holls, the curtain is lifted and 
many interesting debates are opened to the 
reader. The proceedings were at all times 
conducted with dignity and decorum as became 
the gravity of the occasion and of the subjects 
discussed : subjects having a momentous bear- 
ing upon the progress and even the life of 
civilization. No more striking contrast could

be named than that between the wrangling and 
hurly-burly of an ordinary Parliamentary de- 
bate and the finished orations on this occasion 
of the diplomats whose every word was weighed 
and considered before it was uttered, the 
lofty and serene courtesy in the bearing of the 
delegates, each to the other, and the stately 
and gracious method of conducting all pro- 
ceedings, as became an assemblage of gentle- 
men. 

Among the eminent diplomats, members of 
the Conference, may be named Prince Miinster 
Derneburg and Privy Councillor Zorn of Ger- 
many ; Andrew D. White, Seth Low, and 
Frederick W. Holls of the United States ; 
Heinrich Lammasch of Austria ; Chevalier 
Deschamps of Belgium ; Leon Bourgeois and 
Baron d' Estournelles de Constant of France; 
Sir Julian Pauncefote of England ; Baron de 
Stael and Privy Councillor de Martens of 
Russia ; and Baron de Bildt of Sweden and 
Norway. 

Dr. Holls's volume will be a necessity to all 
who would keep in touch with one of the loftiest 
achievements since the meeting of the Barons 
with King John, and an achievement which it 
is hoped through its High Arbitration Tribu- 
nal may be a factor in the settlement of the 
" tremendous problem in the Far East which 
is darkening the horizon of all commercial 

nations." 

FRANKLIN H. HEAD. 



THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMAN ART.* 

To be interested in art, if one be neither 
artist nor critic, is now a deed without a name. 
Those good old words " connoisseur " and " dil- 
ettante " are but seldom heard. Who could 
wish to be called either now ? They belong 
to that bygone period when Mr. Burchell con- 
demned " the tame, correct paintings of the 
Flemish school," in favor of " the erroneous 
but sublime animations of the Roman pencil," 
and George Primrose learned how much repu- 
tation might be gained by praising the works 
of Pietro Perugino. Goethe put the Dilettante 
out of existence (or should have), and the 
same fate has befallen the connoisseur. Yet 
there was good in the names, even if no more 
than this : that one indicated (vaguely, per- 
haps, but etymologically) a person who loved 

* ROMAN ART. By Franz Wickhoff._ Translated and 
edited by Mrs. S. "Arthur Strong, LL.D. New York "The 
Macmillan Go. 



art, and the other a person who knew about it. 

It would be useful to have that distinction 
still. Artists can attend to themselves ; they 
need not care what people call them. And 
critics, too, need not be troubled at the names 
(and epigrams) which they receive. But the 
general run of educated men and women, now, 
have also an interest in art of one kind or an- 
other. Mr. Marshall, some years ago, spoke 
of the ordinary person interested in art as the 
" observer "; but he must have been thinking 
chiefly of painting, for one can hardly be said 
to observe music or poetry. And even were 
the name more inclusive, it does not indicate 
the distinction between those who are content 
to love beautiful things and art, and those 
who wish to know about them. And that 
distinction is an interesting one. 

In almost any field of art you will find these 
two sets. You may observe the difference 
strongly marked by the attitude that people 
take on what they hear of the art criticism of 
Morelli, or of Mr. Berenson, who seems to 
be one of the chief perpetuators of his doc- 
trines. But you will see the difference most 
strongly in the field of ancient art. Read an 
essay of Pater's say that on the Athletic 
Prizemen and then turn to Furtwangler's 
treatment of Polycestus, not precisely the 
same subject but pretty near it, in the " Mas- 
terpieces of Greek Sculpture." You seem 
almost in two different worlds. 

Greek art is a wonder field, nowadays, for 
those who know. The person of cultivated 
taste who liked to look at the Venus of Melos 
in the Louvre, and always felt more pleasantly 
in going up-stairs on account of the Winged 
Victory, hardly knows what to make of a 
recent book on Greek Sculpture. There are 
so many strange, fragmentary, amorphous 
figures, all so important, and so few of the 
Greek statues that one remembers (most of 
them, indeed, very late and treated generally 
with a civil neglect), that it seems quite a 
different world from that we used to hear 
about. 

It is a different world, without a doubt, and 
an extraordinarily interesting one, too. It 
does seem a pity, of course, not to be content 
to love and to appreciate quite genuinely and 
simply the few remains that one knows of 
real Greek work, until one gets the true 
Greek spirit, without all this paraphernalia of 
comparison between all sorts of mutilated 
work of later copyists. But there is still 
immense fascination in going over the patient 



422 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



work, by which out of the Roman copies the 
German scholar actually re-creates for you the 
types of the Greek master, and in appreciating 
the true artistic feeling required as well as the 
literary and archseological knowledge. There 
is interest, too, in reading the classic histor- 
ians, in going over the text of Pliny and 
seeing how, by careful comparison of passages 
from authors as well as of examples of artists, 
there arises before one some conception of the 
history of art in Greece and Rome. 

This is a long introduction to Mrs. Strong's 
translation of Dr. Wickhoff's work on " Roman 
Art," but it has given the standpoint from 
which the general reader will regard the work. 
It is a book on the history of art, on a very 
perplexed period, a book of knowledge and 
scholarship. Yet it will have a sort of fasci- 
nation even to the art-lover. Mrs. Strong is 
already well known from the English edition 
of Furtwangler's " Masterpieces " and from 
the commentary and introduction to the trans- 
lation of Pliny's "Chapters on the History 
of Art " by Miss Lex. Blake. These two 
works lead, in a way, to this third. They, 
however, were on Greek art. This present 
book is on Roman art, one might almost say 
it creates Roman art, so far as concerns any 
independent existence. It is an extremely 
interesting story ; with a good deal conjectural, 
doubtless, with a good deal disputed, of course. 
Dr. Wickhoff succeeds in tracing out a Roman 
development of art from the Greek workmen 
of the time of Augustus down to the earliest 
Christian manuscript-painters of the fifth cen- 
tury. An immensely curious book, one 
would gladly say more of it, although real 
criticism of such a theory belongs to more 
special scholars and more technical journals ; 
a book for those who like to know about art, 
and yet with its interest for the others too. 
Indeed, one cannot follow out the careful 
appreciation of so many sources (very fully 
illustrated, by the way) of Greek copies and 
Roman portraits, of bas-reliefs on the Altar 
of Peace and the Axle of Titus, of painting on 
the walls of Pompeii and the few Roman rem- 
nants, down to that beautiful purple manu- 
script that gave rise to the whole discussion, 
one cannot follow it all carefully through 
without feeling that the distinction we have 
spoken of may be after all an illusion, and 
that in truth one cannot know much about art 
without a genuine love for it. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION PER SE.* 

Now that the Philippine question has partly 
disappeared as a mere factor in partisan war- 
fare, or at least as a campaign issue, there will 
doubtless be a more general disposition to 
consider it on its merits, to arrive at a knowl- 
edge of the facts, and to reach some rational 
conclusion as to what is best to do about it. 
After the heat of contest, when " the shouting 
and the tumult dies," comes the time for reflec- 
tion and deliberation. 

" Great captains, with their guns and drums, 
Disturb our judgment for the hour, 
But at last silence comes." 

And in this silence, with judgments undis- 
turbed by factional strife and passion, is to be 
worked out the practical solution of the prob- 
lems that confront Americans in their new and 
not altogether happy relations with their so- 
called " island possessions." First of all, it is 
evident that full knowledge of the facts is 
essential ; and to this end these recently pub- 
lished books contribute in no small degree. 

The translation, by Dr. David J. Doherty, 
of the brochure of Professor Ferdinand Blum- 
entritt is to be welcomed at this time as shed- 
ding the pure light of scientific investigation 
on a subject that partisan prejudice has clouded 
over. Herr Blumentritt is the professor of 
ethnology in the scientific school of Leitmeritz, 
Bohemia, a member of the Berlin Society of 
Ethnology, and was for years a resident of 
the Philippines, where he was widely known as 
the intimate friend of the patriot-martyr Rizal 
during his later life. He is therefore pos- 
sessed of information which is absolutely need- 
ful to an understanding of the case of the 
Filipino people. The first part of his paper 
is taken up with ethnological considerations. 
He shows that the coast Malays were already 
enjoying a civilization of no mean kind when 
the Spanish discovered the islands. Coming 
just in time to combat the spreading doctrines 
of Islam, Christianity gradually extended over 
the greater part of the archipelago, limiting 
the Moslems to the southern or Sulu islands. 
Of these coast Malays who accepted Christi- 
anity, there are several tribes, representing 
slightly varying ancestral tendencies ; but for

all practical purposes they are a homogeneous 
people, professing one faith and speaking a 
common tongue, with common aspirations and 
no small degree of culture. Herr Blumentritt 
calls attention to the fact that a larger per- 
centage of them are able to read and write 
than in certain self-governing European coun- 
tries, notably Italy, Spain, and some of the 
eastern States like Rou mania and Montenegro 
and, he might have added, some of the 
States of the American Union. This Chris- 
tian population is variously estimated, but 
constitutes an enormous majority of the inhab- 
itants, probably exceeding six and a half mil- 
lions and possibly more than eight millions. 
The rest of the people are the Moslems or 
Moros, with about half a million souls ; the 
heathen hill tribes, numbering about a million ; 
and the aborigines or negritos, who do not 
exceed twenty thousand all told and are rap- 
idly becoming extinct. The pamphlet will be 
found full of similarly useful information, 
being particularly valuable in showing the 
relations borne by the American authorities 
to the clergy of the religious orders in the 
Philippines. 

Mr. Herbert Welsh, the author of "The 
Other Man's Country," has had to do with the 
North American aborigines through many 
years without imputation of selfishness or dis- 
honesty, and has gained no slight knowledge 
of what Americans call inferior races. Thor- 
oughly aware of the hideous immoralities and 
criminal blunders that may be found detailed 
in Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson's " A Century 
of Dishonor," and in various other works, the 
author here enters a plea for a sense of respon- 
sibility and an enlightened conscience which 
will prevent a repetition of these domestic ca- 
lamities in the international arena. More than 
all, he holds in mind the awful price paid by 
the United States for its enslavement of the 
African, and hopes by sober counsel to avoid 
the exaction of a similar penalty for a similar 
offense against Asiatics. The first of the 
American commissions sent to the Philippines 
made a study, imperfect but convincing, of 
British influence in the Malay States the 
brightest stars in the crown of Great Britain's 
imperialism and the least imperialistic. As a 
result an earnest recommendation of a civil 
service similar to that used by England in 
Malaya was made to the government of the 
United States. Unfortunately, there has been 
little disposition shown to use any of the re- 
straints of a properly constituted civil service. 



On the contrary, most of the officers in the 
islands under the American flag, in both hem- 
ispheres, have been selected from a class of 
men which the nation holds in profound dis- 
trust, that of the professional officeholders, 
political heelers and strikers, the men of "pull" 
and " inflooence." Despite the terrible warn- 
ing of " carpet-bag " rule in the South, under 
conditions which make for added terrors by 
way of a censored press, vast distance from the 
centres of national thought, lack of constitu- 
tional restraints, and differences in race, color, 
religion, and civilization, the identical policy 
has been permitted to take root and thrive. 
The regular army alone stands for discipline 
and such morality as a state of war connotes. 
Mr. Welsh has done wisely in calling our at- 
tention at this time to the facts in the case. 
Only by taking note of the errors already 
made can the American people hope to find 
wisdom for future guidance in dealing with 
the most vexatious of questions, and those 
which our political institutions hinder us, in a 
peculiar manner, from handling calmly and in- 
telligently. He has done wisely, too, in setting 
before our eyes the example of Sir Andrew 
Clark in the Malayan peninsula ; since the 
plain alternatives seem to be either an adoption 
of his most satisfactory methods, the crowning 
results of Great Britain's colonial experiments 
through several centuries, at once and with 
thoroughness ; or a treading of the same bar- 
barous and bloody path by which Great Britain 
such eminence as she now maintains 



won 



through another series of grieving centuries. 
Taken in connection with the writings or biog- 
raphies of those who have demonstrated the 
advantages of British advice in the far East, 
it is evident from "The Other Man's Country " 
that the American authorities have disregarded 
every lesson taught by English colonization 
and administration among peoples of another 
language, including those to be gleaned from 
the war in South Africa. An examination 
into Russian methods would show that a study 
of these has been equally neglected. Yet Rus- 
sia possesses an ideal government for adminis- 
tration among alien peoples, by reason of a 
fixed and centralized policy, far above the will 
of a fickle democracy, republic, or constitutional 
monarchy dependent upon the suffrages of an 
intelligent and mutable population. 

Mr. Everett Guy Ballard performs a service 
not unlike that of Mr. Welsh, in his " Liberty, 
Independence, and Self-Government," a pam- 
phlet sufficiently described by its sub-title as

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

i. 



Andrew Lang's monumental life of Prince Charles 
Edward (Scribner) is an important and carefully 
wrought work in historical biography which de- 
serves fuller and more critical treatment than can 
be accorded it here. The rich and elaborate setting 
bestowed upon it by the publishers has, however, 
tempted us to call attention to it under the category 
of Holiday publications, and in this class it, in point 
of sumptuousness, easily heads the season's list. 
The volume is a truly splendid one a princely 
literary and pictorial memorial of a lost cause, 
which many a Jacobite of the old type (and we be- 
lieve there are still a few fantastic survivals of it) 
might have consented to beggar himself to possess. 
We do not mean to ascribe to Mr. Lang who 
has written with the greatest fairness and impar- 
tiality, though a Scot and a " romantic " any 
undue degree of bias in favor of the cause or the 
personality of the gallant and picturesque, though 
relatively not altogether worthy, adventurer who 
set Britain ablaze in " Forty Five," and whose 
memory was cherished long after in hearts far 
nobler and purer than his own. Mr. Lang began 
his task, as we infer, with a certain romantic pre- 
dilection for his hero ; but as his researches pro- 
gressed he was fain to admit that the Jacobite idol 
was not all that the perfervid Jacobite fancy painted 
him that he was, though in many respects an 
amiable and well-meaning young man, not at all 
the " very perfect gentle knight " of song and story. 
" His figure," says Mr. Lang, " is beheld in a lustre 
not its own : in the splendor of the love and loyalty 
that gave themselves ungrudgingly for him and for 
his cause, that cherished his memory, and even now 
hold it a kind of treason to tell the truth as far as 
the truth can be known." Having written thus in 
the spirit of the historian, and having endeavored 
to walk in the light of the records alone, it is not 



to be wondered at that Mr. Lang finds cause to 
complain that he is " censured as a Jacobite and a 
Whig." Having no prejudices of our own either 
way, we are inclined to believe that Mr. Lang has 
painted a true portrait, and one that will remain 
for all time the standard presentment of the man 
Prince Charles Edward. His book is based mainly 
on the Stuart Papers at Windsor Castle ; but no 
original and trustworthy source of information has 
been left unexplored. " In printed books," be says, 
" I have read, I think, most that has been pub- 
lished." Let us add that Mr. Lang has told this 
fascinating story in a pure, flexible, steadily flowing, 
and limpid style that is so good that the reader is 
not conscious, except upon reflection, how very 
good it is. The chronicler's veracity joined to the 
narrator's art is an ideal difficult of attainment; yet 
Mr. Lang approaches it nearly. The book is the 
best, and should prove the most enduring, thing he 
has done. The volume has received every embel- 
lishment of the book-maker's and the engraver's 
art. The frontispiece, a beautifully colored plate, 
and quite the finest piece of color-printing that we 
remember to have seen, is a portrait of the Prince, 
after Largilliere's painting in the National Portrait 
Gallery. This noble plate serves as an earnest of 
a wealth of portraits and other illustrations which 
must be examined to be appreciated. Among the 
subjects are Prince James Francis Stuart, Princes 
Sobieska, Prince Henry Stuart, Marquis D'Argen- 
son, Lord Elcho, Jenny Cameron of Lochiel, the 
Duke of Cumberland, Keith the Earl Marischal, 
Flora Macdonald (2), and the Duchess of Albany. 
Hogarth's famous plates, " Lord Lovat Counting 
the Clans," and the " March to Finchley," are 
handsomely reproduced. But we must refer the 
reader to the volume itself for a further view of its 
attractions. 

We are glad to note that the beautiful volume on 
" Famous Homes of Great Britain," which we had 
occasion to praise last season, met with a success 
that warrants the issue this year of a kindred and 
companion volume entitled " More Famous Homes 
of Great Britain, and Their Stories" (Putnam), 
also edited by Mr. A. H. Malan. In England, with 
the wealthier class, the town-house has always been 
a rather unimportant accessory a sort of tem- 
porary shelter or convenience for use during " the 
season," while the country-house has been the real 
inalienable home and abiding-place, the centre of 
family treasures and traditions, the storied cradle 
of the race. The English ancestral country home 
is invested with the dignity 'of a national institution, 
which finds but a faint and imperfect counterpart 
in other countries. The present volume describes 
in sufficient detail the beauties and treasures of a 
dozen of the more noteworthy country seats of En- 
gland and Scotland, the articles being in many 
instances from the pens of the respective owners of 
the places described. The volume is richly illus- 
trated with photographic plates, showing the seats 
described and their surroundings, historic rooms,

art treasures, family portraits, choice architectural 
details, etc. The book forms as good a substitute 
as can be got for a sight-seeing jaunt to these 
cynosural spots of rural England. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish a new and 
elaborate two-volume edition of Helen Hunt Jack- 
son's popular " Ramona," that tender and romantic 
picture of old-Californian life which American read- 
ers should know and cherish as one of the few dis- 
tinctively native novels in which a degree of real 
imaginative power is shown. Though over sixteen 
years have elapsed since the death of Mrs. Jackson, 
little is generally known of her life, and therefore 
the publishers of the present edition have done 
well in prefixing to it a biographical sketch of the 
author from the sympathetic pen of Miss Susan 
Coolidge. Mr. Henry Sandham, the illustrator, 
furnishes a note in which he tells how his original 
sketches for " Ramona " were made. The volumes 
are tastefully bound, and contain all of Mr. Sand- 
ham's admirable illustrations, reproduced in photo- 
gravure. 

A clean-cut and trenchant style, and the frequent 
marks of real nicety of perception and of the habit 
of looking somewhat below the surface of things, 
lend to Mr. Richard Whiteing's " Paris of To-Day " 
(Century Co.) a certain distinction among books 
of its generally ephemeral class. Mr. Whiteing is 
at once artist and analyst ; and one cannot glance 
through his pages, however casually, without feel- 
ing that, for all their glow of color and hurly-burly 
of movement, they are the work of a man who has 
seriously tried to understand the men and manners 
he paints. Mr. Whiteing's book, furthermore, is a 
good deal more than the record of the impressions 
of an intelligent and thoughtful visitor to the 
French capital, inasmuch as it is freighted with 
the general observations of the student on topics of 
art, literature, and politics, and is thus in no small 
measure a work of criticism, and a delightful one 
in its kind ; and of this the reader may easily con- 
vince himself by turning to the chapters on " The 
Governmental Machine " and " Artistic Paris." 
So good a book deserves an inviting setting, and a 
somewhat sumptuous one has been accorded it by 
the publishers. The volume is an ample octavo 
(10 x 7 inches) of 250 pages, bound in dark-blue 
cloth richly stamped with the municipal arms in 
red, white, and gold. The graphic force of Mr. 
Whiteing's vivid descriptions is enhanced by the 
numerous drawings of Andre" Castaigne, whose 
merits as an illustrator need not now be pointed out. 
All in all, the book, pictorially and otherwise, is the 
best one on Paris, contemporary Paris, that we 
remember to have seen for a decade. 

The " Gibson girl " is copiously and attractively 
represented this year in Mr. Gibson's "Americans " 
(R. H. Russell), but not to the total exclusion of other 
types of Gibsonized natives. We say " Gibsonized " 
because, while Mr. Gibson to a considerable degree 
holds up the mirror to nature in his pictures, 
there is nevertheless generally in them a pretty 



marked personal equation to be eliminated if we 
are to get at the strict truth as told by the solar 
pencil, for instance. Of course, since Mr. Gibson 
devotes himself to drawing " types " he must gen- 
eralize ; but there is danger in cultivating a man- 
nerism which tends to fix and stereotype itself in 
the end. The present volume is the fifth in the 
familiar series of Mr. Gibson's published drawings, 
and is as clever in execution and as entertaining in 
theme as its popular predecessors. It contains 
eighty-four cartoons. 

To praise the " Temple " editions of standard 
authors is now almost superfluous. These choice 
little volumes are, as everybody knows, gems of 
dainty and artistic book-manufacture. To the series 
is now added the K Temple Dickens," in which the 
publishers (Messrs. Dent in London and Doubleday- 
McClure Co. in the United States) have added cer- 
tain special features which make the set rather sur- 
pass its predecessors in attractiveness. Each of 
the forty volumes contains, for example, a daintily 
colored frontispiece, from original drawings by 
various artists. The bindings are of flexible dark- 
green lambskin, prepared by a special process ; and 
they do not, we are glad to note, "curl up" in the 
exasperating way which usually makes the soft 
cover a nuisance. This special edition is limited 
to a thousand numbered copies, and these are the 
first impressions from absolutely new plates. The 
happy owner of a set of the " Temple Dickens " is 
to be congratulated on possessing what, in the not 
distant future, will in all likelihood be rated among 
the objects of bibliophilistic longing, not to say 
envy. 

In his scholarly and severely critical study of 
" Fra Angelico " (Macmillan), Mr. Langton Doug- 
las gives our commonly cherished preconception of 
Fra Angelico as the mere mystical painter of 
dreams and visions a somewhat rude but perhaps 
salutary shock. Relying strictly upon evidence 
furnished by the artist's paintings and drawings, 
Mr. Douglas labors with much erudition and con- 
siderable success to show that Fra Angelico was 
not only the saint and the rapt dreamer of poetico- 
religious dreams, but the humanist and scholar, the 
student of the antique, and the ardent cultivator 
of the dry technique, the handicraftmanship, of 
his art. " In him," says Mr. Douglas, " the artist 
and the saint, the devout Catholic and the man of 
the Renaissance, were in perfect harmony." Mr. 
Douglas's handling of his theme is fresh and 
scholarly, and his book may be commended without 
stint to the student desiring to examine the purely 
artistic side of Fra Angelico's art, and to detect 
the traces of learning, archaeological and other, that 
unquestionably lurk therein. The 1 volume is care- 
fully prepared, and contains much in the way of 
reference and bibliography for which the studious 
reader will be thankful. Print, paper, etc., are 
unexceptionable, and the long list of beautiful 
illustrations enriches a work that forms one of the 
choicer gift-books of the season.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



llossettians will thank Miss Elisabeth Luther Gary 
for her monograph on " The Uossettia, Dante 
Gabriel andChristina"(Patnam), withits photograv- 
ure reproductions of the characteristic examples of 
Rossetti's work which form the priceless collection 
of Mr. Samuel Bancroft, Jr., of Wilmington, Dela- 
ware. In Mr. Bancroft's house hang the " Lady 
Lilith," the "Found," the " Magdalen," the " Water 
Willow," the " Ruth Herbert " study in gold and 
umber, the portrait in colored chalks of Mr. F. R. 
Leyland, and an early study of still-life a collec- 
tion exemplifying every period and style of Ros- 
setti's art. The present volume contains repro- 
ductions of all these works save the last two, 
together with one drawn by Frederick Shields of 
Rossetti after death, a sketch also in Mr. Bancroft's 
collection. While it is these pictures that lend to 
Miss Gary's book its peculiar charm and value, her 
well-balanced study of Dante Gabriel bears the 
impress of sanity of view and cool discrimination, 
and serves to correct and modify current distorted 
impressions of this somewhat fantastic and not 
altogether amiable genius. Of critical value also 
are Miss Gary's two chapters on Christina Rossetti. 
On the whole, the work is a sound and scholarly 
production, and one not devoid of literary charm. 
The volume is handsomely made, and of marked 
attractiveness pictorially. 

Mr. Charles E. Brock's capital and copious 
drawings form a sufficient pretext for the reissue 
of Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin's two entertaining 
books entitled " Penelope's English Experiences " 
and "Penelope's Progress" (Houghton). Each 
volume contains fifty odd pictures which duly reflect 
the vivacious humor of the text. Of narratives of 
the foreign experiences of the American female 
tourist, we have had not a few of late ; but we do 
not recall any of these that for refined humor, sting- 
less and therefore agreeable satire, and general 
charm of style, are worthy to be compared with 
these popular stories (for such they are in form) 
of Mrs. Wiggins. They may be read to the best 
advantage, or re-read with an added zest, in this 
pictorial Holiday edition, in which the two volumes 
are boxed together as a set. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers' extra Holiday 
edition, in two volumes, of Mrs. Humphry Ward's 
new novel, " Eleanor," is at once elegant and in- 
expensive, and makes a strong bid for popularity 
with the Christmas book-buyer. The Italian set- 
ting of the story and the outward grace and charm 
of its leading actors offer a tempting field for the 
illustrator, and Mr. Albert Sterner has exploited it 
acceptably in his fourteen full page plates which 
form the pictorial feature of the edition. Mr. 
Sterner draws well, and he has evidently taken 
pains to come at a definite conception of the people 
so delightfully limned by his author before put- 
ting his own pencil to paper. The result is a har- 
mony between text and pictures which is most 
grateful to the reader. Mrs. Ward's book is per- 
haps the most important of the season's novels, 



and is entitled to much fuller and more critical 
treatment than can be accorded it in the present 
article. Our necessarily somewhat hurried pre- 
liminary inspection of it has left us with the im- 
pression that it is more the result of a purely 
artistic aim than anything Mrs. Ward has yet given 
us. The book is one which readers of current 
literature must not leave unread, and it may be 
read to the best advantage in this notably enticing 
Holiday edition. 

Much breath is wasted in debates over the origin 
and authorship of older popular and national songs, 
by disputants with whom race sentiment and loy- 
alty to a name take the place of evidence to the 
fact. There has long been need of an authority to 
turn to for a rational settlement of such contro- 
versies ; and the two comely duodecimo volumes 
now before us, " Stories of Famous Songs " (Lip- 
pincott), seem to go a considerable way toward 
supplying it. Mr. S. J. Adair Fitz-Gerald, the 
editor of the work, has spent some fifteen years in 
the agreeable task of running to earth, so to speak, 
such famous songs as are of doubtful origin, and in 
gathering facts and reminiscences about such songs 
as were written under romantic, pathetic, or enter- 
taining circumstances. Every available source 
biographies, histories, reviews, old MSS., etc. 
has been ransacked for evidence ; and the result is 
a work that is decidedly entertaining, and, we 
should think, trustworthy. Almost all the favorite 
songs whose story is at all worth retelling figure 
more or less conspicuously in Mr. Fitz Gerald's 
bright and readable work. The volumes are given 
a tasteful Holiday dress, and contain several suit- 
able illustrations in photogravure and half-tone. 

Of that always refined and graceful illustrator, 
Mr. Will H. Low, it may fairly be said that he 
touches nothing that he does not adorn and beautify. 
Mr. Low's pencil is charmingly in evidence this 
year in Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s edition of 
" As You Like It " one of the half-dozen most 
artistic and alluring of the season's publications. 
Mr. Low's drawings are a joy to the eye, and really 
enhance one's enjoyment of the text : and how often 
one is compelled to say the reverse where the 
illustrators of Shakespeare are in question ! Print, 
paper, and binding are of flawless quality, and the 
semi-illustrative marginal decoration or border in 
red is pleasing and does not overload the page. 

The Macmillan Co. bring out in lavishly- 
illustrated Holiday form Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's 
capital book on " Stage-Coach and Tavern Days." 
The author is thoroughly at home in dealing with 
the picturesque days of primitive travel, and her 
delightful pages form as vivid a presentment of the 
subject as anybody is likely to ask for. The illus- 
trations are profuse and well-executed, giving just 
the aid needed to a thorough appreciation and 
enjoyment of the text. There are pictures of old 
inns, old coaches, old sign-boards, old tap-rooms, 
old turn-pikes, toll-gates, sleighs, milestones, all 
sorts of odds and ends of tavern furnishings and 



1900.]

tap-room utensils pitchers, punch-bowls, ladles, 
platters, flip-glasses, toddy-sticks, nutmeg-holders, 
and what not, together with some interesting cuts 
after contemporary prints that mirror faithfully 
the ways and woes and comforts and hardships of 
the traveller in what some of us are pleased to call 
"the good old times." Those who wish to trans- 
port themselves in fancy to the phase of them in 
question cannot do better than procure a copy of 
the beautiful pictorial edition of Mrs. Earle's 
scholarly work. The buckram cover shows a quaint 
design, in red and green, stamped in the centre 
with a cut of an old inn sign. 

Admirers of " David Harum," and their name is 
legion, will be glad to know that the Messrs. 
Appleton have issued a well-made pictorial edition 
of the book, a copy of which will answer nicely for 
a Holiday gift. The drawings are mainly by Mr. 
B. West Clinedinst, a very capable illustrator, we 
need hardly say, who has thoroughly grasped the 
humor of Mr. Westcott's quaint hero. A desirable 
feature of the new edition is an Introduction, by 
Mr. Forbes Heermans, embodying a sketch of Mr. 
Westcott, of whom, also, a portrait is supplied. 
The illustrations consist of nine full-page plates and 
a generous sprinkling of text cuts, part of which are 
to be credited to Mr. C. D. Farrand. The pictures 
serve to enhance the graphic quality of the text 
(if that were needed) and are enjoyable in them- 
selves. 

" Diedrich Knickerbocker's " ever delectable 
" History of New York " is issued in novel form 
from the press of Mr. R. H. Russell. The volume 
is a substantial buckram-backed folio, of ample size, 
yet alluring to the fancy of the reader who wants 
to read comfortably and at his leisure in short, 
to the reader looking forward to that perhaps most 
satisfactory and durable of earthly enjoyments, a 
winter's evening at the home fireside with an agree- 
able book as a companion. The touch of archaism 
(too strong a word here, perhaps) in the make-up 
of the volume in no wise detracts from its inviting 
appearance. The pictorial feature is eight full-page 
drawings of rich humor and good technical quality, 
which fully attest that the artist, Mr. Maxfield 
Parrish, knows his Knickerbocker as a New Yorker 
should. Mr. Parrish's Dutchmen are irresistible, 
and we wish Irving might have seen them. 

The player has advanced in repute (and we fancy 
in behavior) since the day when pious Bishop Grin- 
dal called the Thespians an "idle sort of people, 
which have been infamous to all good common- 
wealths." " Society " has opened its doors to him, 
and books unnumbered are written in his honor. 
We have now before us a brace of rather sumptu- 
ous volumes, entitled severally " Twelve Great 
Actors " and " Twelve Great Actresses " (Putnam), 
wherein Mr. Edward Robins sketches briefly and 
entertainingly, and with the gusto of a confirmed 
"first-nighter," the stage careers of such notable 
players (most of them stars now passed from the 
playhouse firmament) as Garrick, Macready, Kean, 



the Booths, Sothern, Wallack, the Woffington, the 
Bracegirdle, Rachel, Miss Cushman, Miss Neilson, 
Ristori, and so on. Mr. Robins's books are read- 
able, full of piquant anecdote, and chatty as books 
about the stage should be ; and the publishers have 
issued them in tempting form, with liberal illustra- 
tions. 

Lovers of books about the stage should not over- 
look, while on their Christmas-gift-hunting peri- 
grinations this season, the two natty little volumes 
presented by the F. A. Stokes Co., containing 
sketches of Mr. John Drew and Miss Ellen Terry, 
the first named production by Mr. Edward A. 
Dithmar, the second by Mr. Clement Scott. Mr. 
Dithmar's book, in particular, strikes us as a rather 
superior bit of work in its way capital as a bio- 
graphical study and critical in tone. Mr. Clement 
Scott is well, what he always is ; that is to say, 
the entertaining purveyor of stage chat and more 
or less sentimental reminiscences of his own earlier 
play-going days. He tells us, in the present vol- 
ume, a good deal about Miss Terry (whose adorer 
he has been since he first saw her away back in the 
ties) ; and he also tells us a good deal, more 
suo, about Mr. Scott. The volumes are neatly 
bound and finely printed, and each contains a 
generous array of photographic plates showing its 
hero, or heroine, in favorite parts. 

Mr. Henry James's " Little Tour in France " 
(Houghton) makes its welcome reappearance rein- 
forced at last by the belated drawings of Mr. Joseph 
Pen n ell, without which, for some reason not ex- 
plained, it was originally issued. Says Mr. James, 
in his new Preface : " The little book thus goes 
forth finally as the picture-book it was intended to 
be." We need not again praise, nor characterize 
in detail, these pleasant travel-papers, which have 
so easily won their way without pictorial aid ; but, 
of course, in buying the book, a copy with Mr. 
Pennell's lovely drawings is the one to choose. The 
binding shows a bold and suggestive cover-design, 
and the volume throughout is a model of neatness. 
But we should prefer a type of somewhat stronger 
face, the print striking us as a little pale and 
indistinct. 

Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's sentimental tale, 
Wanted, A Match-Maker " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), 
has its improbabilities of a psychological sort, and 
a cynical critic might carp at its " situations." But 
it is touching enough and interesting enough as one 
reads it. In it, a daughter of New York's Four 
Hundred (aristocratic and ornamental, but with a 
heart) is brought into collision with a hospital doc- 
tor (useful and durable, but plebeian,) through an 
accident to a newsboy (pathetic, but preternaturally 
" slangy,") who has been providentially run over 
(Cor. Fifth Ave. and 42d St.) by the daughter of 
the F. H.'s brougham, and who turns out, of course, 
to be the Match-Maker wanted. The book has 
been beautifully gotten up by the publishers, and is, 
indeed, in point of decorations (mainly fanciful 
marginal borders in light-green and black), which 



428 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



are by Miss Margaret Armstrong, one of the 
marked artistic successes of the season. There are 
also five full-plate illustrations by Mr. Howard 
Chandler Christy, who has done well from the art- 
istic point of view, but has, we think, erred as an 
illustrator in portraying the plain and serviceable 
doctor as an immaculate " swell " of the Gibson 
variety which is (according to Mr. Ford, who 
ought to know,) precisely what he was not. But 
otherwise Mr. Christy's pictures are charming 
notably the one facing page 62, which is really a 
gem in its way. The cover-design is particularly 
good in pattern and color, and should tempt many 
a one to open and inspect this pretty book. 

Those twin old-time favorites, Dickens's " Christ- 
mas Carol " and " The Cricket on the Hearth," 
which have brightened so many a Christmastide 
and taught so many the human value and signifi- 
cance of Christmas cheer, come to us this year from 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, in dainty dress bright 
with the green and red of holly, and enriched with 
many sympathetic and appreciative drawings by 
Mr. Frederick Simpson Coburn, who has done 
artistic and imaginative justice to those old favor- 
ites, Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, John Peery- 
bingle, Tackleton, Caleb Plummer, and the rest. 
The little volumes are irreproachable in make-up, 
and we have nothing but praise for Mr. Coburn's 
delightful pictures, which lend quite an air of new- 
ness to these treasured old friends. 

"The Lover's Library " (John Lane) is a series, 
now current, of tiny volumes in which it is meant to 
include all that the great British poets have written 
about love, together with an occasional volume of 
prose on the same interesting subject, or one of 
modern verse which may be deemed worthy of in- 
clusion. We have now before us three volumes of 
the series, Browning's " Love Poems" and 
Shelley's, and Edmond Holmes's " The Silence of 
Love " a dainty trio of pocketable booklets 
which any discriminating lover might be glad to 
possess. Their advantages as gift-books from a 
lover to the object of his " attentions " are too ob- 
vious to be stated, and they certainly seem expressly 
got up for this purpose, with their general material 
suggestion of a bunch of Spring violets (floriated 
marginal designs in violet color, green lettering, 
and so on). The editor's name is not given, but 
we presume a correct text has been aimed at. 

In the exquisite settings of the brace of little 
companion volumes entitled " Among the Great 
Masters in Music " and "Among the Great Masters 
in Literature," both by Mr. Walter Rowlands, 
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. have fairly distinguished 
themselves. In the volume first-named Mr. Row- 
lands tells entertainingly of scenes in the lives of 
St. Cecilia, Lulli, Stradivarius, Bach, Mozart, 
Linley, Haydn, Beethoven, Rouget de Lisle, 
Paganini, Chopin, Wagner, Liszt, and others; in 
the second a like treatment is accorded Homer, 
Sappho, Dante, Tasso, Chaucer, Shakespeare, 
Walton, Pope, Sterne, Johnson, Moliere, Voltaire, 



Schiller, Goethe, etc. The text is intelligently 
written, and forms largely a running commentary 
on the illustrations, of which there are thirty-two 
to the volume a very liberal allotment, it must 
be admitted. These little books are flawlessly 
made, and should easily make their way. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson, who will be pleasantly re- 
called by many as the author and illustrator of a 
pretty book of last season entitled " Among English 
Hedgerows," now puts forth a similar and equally 
attractive volume, recounting through text and pic- 
tures his experiences as a not unsentimental stroller 
"Along French Byways " (Macmillan). The illus- 
trations, of which there are many, are mainly from 
photographs taken en route by Mr Johnson, who is 
an expert with the camera. They represent a va- 
riety of passing scenes and incidents illustrative of 
French rural and village life, and form a pleasant 
running accompaniment to the text, in which the 
author tells in a chatty and informal way the story 
of his rambles. The book is attractively bound, 
and forms a suitable shelf-companion for its pop- 
ular predecessor. 

The late James T. Fields's "Yesterdays with 
Authors " (Houghton), a charming book which 
needs no introduction to our readers, makes its 
reappearance in Holiday dress, with a noble array 
of portraits and some letters in facsimile heretofore 
unpublished. The binding shows an elaborate de- 
sign in green and gold, and altogether the volume 
is one of the most suitable in our list as a gift to a 
friend of literary tastes. 

A chaste edition of Tennyson's " In Memoriam," 
of elegant yet severely simple make, and distin- 
guished in particular by a typography that is a 
veritable joy to the sense, is published by the 
Bankside Press of London, and sold in America 
by M. F. Mansfield of New York. The page em- 
bellishments are confined to the rubricated initials, 
from the excellent designs of Miss Blanche 
McManus ; and the binding is of cream-white 
buckram of medium weave, delicately stamped in 
gilt, with title, date, and allegorical sketch in con- 
ventionalized outline. The material throughout is 
of high quality, and, for our part, we are inclined 
to pronounce the volume an ideal one for the real 
lover of this noble poem. 

" Literary Hearthstones," the collective title of 
Marion Harland's deservedly popular series of bio- 
graphical studies (Putnam), seems a trifle far- 
fetched when we examine the volumes to discover 
the special characteristic it is meant to suggest. 
Perhaps in the two numbers of the series now 
before us, on John Knox and Hannah More, and 
especially in the first named of them, Mrs. Terhune 
has perforce drifted away from the special treat- 
ment of her themes which she proposed to her- 
self at the outstart. At all events, her sketch of 
Knox is a good biographical study of the usual 
type, outlining the career of its hero without special 
effort to set before us the domestic or " home fire- 
side " phase of it. In Hannah More, Mrs. Terhune 



1900.] 



THE DIAL 



429 



has found a theme well suited to her pen, which 
runs on with cheery feminine vivacity in a field so 
well strewn with anecdote and chat about interest- 
ing people. Mrs. Terhune, it may be added, has 
not been content with merely skimming the cream 
from the older narratives an easy process and a 
royal road to readability. Her studies evince 
research and reflection ; and there is always the 
suggestion of a certain individuality of view. The 
volumes (boxed in sets of two) are fully illustrated, 
and rank among the most tempting and desirable 
of the Holiday publications of the less ephemeral 
sort. 

Mr. Howard Pyle's clever and imaginative draw- 
ings add an element of strength to the comely vol- 
ume containing Mr. Markham's " The Man with 
the Hoe, and Other Poems " (Doubleday & McClure 
Co.). Mr. Pyle's frontispiece is a notably fine bit 
of pictorial allegory from the artistic point of 
view albeit the American farmer, at least, will 
hardly thank Mr. Pyle for the unflattering intima- 
tions therein contained. Besides Mr. Pyle's frontis- 
piece, the volume contains a reproduction of the 
painting by Millet which inspired Mr. Markham's 
somewhat doleful production. Mr. Pyle's head 
and tail pieces are cleverly done and duly sug- 
gestive. , 

For those who have not yet read, and for those 
who want to re-read, Parkman's ever-delightful 
" Oregon Trail," a copy of Messrs. Little, Brown, & 
Co.'s edition of it, with Mr. Frederic Remington's 
drawings, is decidedly the book to get. Mr. Reming- 
ton is of course the ideal illustrator for Parkman's 
classic work. He knows the Far West as it was 
when his author journeyed through it in the later 
forties ; and the text, graphic and picturesque as it 
is, finds a powerful help in these spirited draw- 
ings, whose merit lies mainly in the fact that they 
are strictly and literally true. There are seventy- 
five of them, including numerous full-page plates. 

A comely volume bearing the irresistible title 
" The Wedding Day in Literature and Art " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.) binds together in one delectable gar- 
land " the best descriptions of weddings from the 
works of the world's leading novelists and poets," 
together with reproductions of famous paintings of 
incidents of the nuptial day. The young man who 
has " serious intentions " need surely look no far- 
ther than this book for an acceptable gift for the 
object of them, and for a delicate preliminary inti- 
mation that he has arrived at the state of mind so 
tersely described by Mr. Barkis. The compiler of 
the book, Mr. C. F. Carter, is clearly a man of 
charitable mind ; for he states that his work has 
been done partly " in order that those who cannot 
or will not marry may at least contemplate the 
conjugal felicity of others from as many points of 
view as possible." This is kind, and attests more- 
over Mr. Carter's faith in that sweetness of temper 
and capacity for contemplating ungrudgingly the 
bliss of others for which old bachelors are justly 
famous the world over. The authors named in Mr. 



Carter's table of contents are too numerous to be 
even exemplified here ; but why was the wedding of 
Mr. Pip's legal friend Mr. Wemmick (surely one 
of the most unique events of the kind in literature) 
omitted? The pictures are well chosen and well 
reproduced, and the volume, with its notably grace- 
ful cover-design, should make a strong bid for pop- 
ular favor. 

Four of the " Pre-Raphaelite Ballads " of William 
Morris have been selected for decorative treatment 
by Mr. H. M. O'Kane, and the resulting publica- 
tion, which bears the imprint of the A. Wessels Co., 
is a small volume so charming that we linger over 
its pages with unalloyed satisfaction. The illus- 
trative material consists of borders, full-page draw- 
ings, and rubricated initials, all in keeping with the 
Kelmscott type and the old-world feeling of the 
text. The book is in boards with a linen back, and 
the edition is limited. 

A most engaging and prettily made little volume 
of diversified literary chat is Dr. Theodore F. 
Wolfe's "Literary Rambles at Home and Abroad " 
(Lippincott). The book is complete in itself, but 
the author nevertheless wishes it to be appraised in 
connection with the preceding volumes to which it 
is related. Dr. Wolfe has derived the material 
for the present volume from sojourns in the 
places described, and from conversations or corre- 
spondence with the authors mentioned or their 
surviving friends. In his opening chapters Dr. 
Wolfe chats pleasantly of Poe, Audubon, Irving, 
Willis, Mr. Stedman, Stephen Crane, Mr. Stockton, 
Walt Whitman, Cooper, and others ; then, passing 
over sea, he reviews the memories and associations 
that enwrap Stratford-on-Avon, Harrow, the Ayr- 
shire Burnsland, and the Lake Country; The pages 
on Byron are unusually interesting. The volume 
is charmingly illustrated, and is one of the best 
and daintiest of the Christmas books. 

That fine perennial, " Lorna Doone," blooms 
again with new outward attractions as regularly as 
the Holiday season rolls round. Those who have 
not yet read this strong novel will do well to procure 
a copy of Harpers' new one-volume edition of it, 
enriched with drawings by Mr. W. Small and with 
views of the Doone country from the photographs 
taken expressly for the purpose by Mr. Clifton 
Johnson, whose name is a warrant for the excellence 
of his work. The volume contains 560 close-printed 
pages, and its quality is surprisingly good consider- 
ing the moderate price asked for it. 

Mrs. Clara Erskine Clement's acceptable little 
monograph on "Heroines of the Bible in Art" 
(L. C. Page & Co.), with its thirty odd illustrations 
after famous painters, ancient and modern, forms 
a pretty gift-book which is timely in theme and 
sufficiently decorative in make-up. The dainty 
cover in light-blue with symbolical design in white 
and gold calls for a word of praise.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



by Mr. Benjamin E. Smith ; Dr. John Brown's 
" Rab and his Friends," with an Introduction by 
Mr. Andrew Lang; "Motifs," by Mr. E. Scott 
O'Connor, a volume of passing reflections, subtly 
conceived and daintily worded, with an Introduc- 
tion by Miss Agnes Repplier. For a pretty and 
inexpensive gift to a friend of refined taste, one of 
these diminutive beautifully printed and chastely 
decorated volumes would answer nicely. 

A rich and racy flavor of Dixie Land pervades 
the flat folio volume entitled " Down South " (R. H. 
Russell). The book is virtually an album of photo- 
graphic pictures illustrative of negro life and char- 
acter in the rural districts of the remoter South ; 
and the illustrator, Mr. Rudolph Eickmeyer, Jr., 
must be credited with unusual good taste in his 
selection of subjects, as well as with much skill in 
the use of the camera. A quiet humor pervades 
the pictures generally ; but there is a commendable 
absence of the burlesque element which caricatur- 
ists of negro life have accentuated ad nauseam. In 
fact, the book is a delightful one in its way a 
quiet, truthful reflection of a phase of American 
life now fading fast into history. A thoughtful 
preface is provided by Mr. Joel Chandler Harris. 

" Omarians " will find their account this season 
in the artistic production entitled " The Book of 
Omar and Rub&iya't" (M. F. Mansfield), a pictor- 
ial and literary miscellany comprising among other 
unique features reprints of selected addresses made 
at the dinners of the Omar Khayyam Club of 
London, facsimiles of menu and guest cards, etc. 
The volume, a royal octavo of about a hundred 
pages, is beautifully printed from type, and the 
edition is limited to a thousand copies. Mention 
is deservedly made, by one of the contributors who 
writes of Omar's translators, of the too-little-known 
version of Mr. J. L. Garner, an American. Mr. 
Garner's fine quatrain, 

" The violets that by this river grow 
Sprang from some lip here buried long ago ; 
And tread thou lightly on this tender green, 
Who sleepeth here so still thou ne'er wilt know," 

is pronounced a "much better" rendering than 
the corresponding stanza by Fitz-Gerald, a judgment 
which comparison easily bears out. Mr. Garner's 
little book should be reprinted. The volume under 
review is of considerable artistic pretensions out- 
wardly, and contains several illustrations, among 
them a frontispiece on vellum, and a portrait of 
Fitz-Gerald. In the cover-design and end-papers, 
the skill in decoration of Miss Blanche McManus 
is again in evidence. 

" A fine quotation," says Roux, " is a diamond 
on the finger of a man of wit." A shining collection 
of these gems may be found in the well-appointed 
volume entitled " The World's Best Proverbs " 
(Laird & Lee). The compiler, Mr. George Howard 
Opdyke, has taken unusual pains to marshal his 
selections in a convenient and even logical way. 
The proverbs are grouped by subjects alphabetic- 
ally arranged, with the happy results that the par- 



ticular maxim one may chance to want is easily 
found, and that a measure of continuity is imparted 
to the text. The book is ornately bound with a view 
to its suitableness as a gift, and contains several 
full-page illustrations. 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page's story of " The Old 
Gentleman in the Black Stock " is a good one for 
pictorial exploitation, as Mr. Howard Chandler 
Christy's baker's dozen of tinted drawings in 
Scribner's new edition of the book attest. The 
story has been somewhat enlarged by Mr. Page 
for this edition, and we should be quite willing to 
see it enlarged once more in the future, for it is 
one of the author's best. 

Miss Sarah Williams's " Through the Year with 
Birds and Poets " (Lee & Shepard) is an anthology 
of American bird-poems, the selections being classi- 
fied according to the seasons of the year, and sub- 
divided by months. The conception of the book is 
a happy one, and it has been well carried out. 
Ninety-nine American authors are represented, and 
there are 242 poems and extracts from poems, the 
whole making a volume of 350 pages. The full- 
page drawings of Mr. Walter M. Hardy, though a 
little stiff and formal, are clear and accurate, and 
serve to illustrate rather than merely adorn. 

For a friend of a pious turn, the rather ornate 
but substantial volume entitled " The Four Evan- 
gelists in Classic Art " (Whittaker) should form a 
welcome and an edifying gift. The editor of the 
work, Miss Rachel A. La Fontaine, has exercised due 
care and circumspection in selecting and arranging 
the somewhat multifarious writings, in prose and 
poetry, that form its content. The evangelical 
chronicles are rich in subject-matter for the religious 
painter, and the editor has had the advantage of a 
wide field of selection in choosing her illustrations. 
These comprise many well executed plates in half- 
tone, after representative artists, ancient and mod- 
ern. The volume is both seasonable in content and 
pleasing in form. 

Professor H. Knackfuss's learned monograph 
on Albrecht Diirer (Lemcke & Buechner), trans- 
lated by Mr. Campbell Dodgson, and illustrated by 
134 reproductions of Dilrer's works, is an art 
work of genuine worth that will be much prized by 
serious students of the Nuremburg master and his 
powerful productions. This thoroughly good 
though inexpensive book is the latest number in 
the series of monographs prepared under the super- 
vision of Prof. Knackfuss and designed to form 
when complete a history of the great periods of 
art, though each volume is complete in itself. Mr. 
Dodgson's good work as translator calls for special 
commendation. 

That old Greek fairy-tale, ever fresh and fair, of 
" Eros and Psyche," gracefully re- told, after Apu- 
leius, by Dr. Paul Carus, forms the basis and motif 
of the artistic embellishment of one of the prettiest 
of the smaller publications of the season. Mr. Paul 
Thumann's exquisite series of drawings illustrative 
of the tale are reproduced in the volume, and form

its distinctive pictorial feature. Good taste, and a 
sense of the classic spirit, are everywhere shown in 
the make-up of the little book, which will surely 
find numerous friends. (The Open Court Publish- 
ing Co.) 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers reissue their fine 
edition of Charles Reade's masterpiece, " The Clois- 
ter and the Hearth," with the profuse and admir- 
able illustrations by Mr. William Martin Johnson, 
which must be seen, and even closely inspected, to 
be appreciated. The work is easily one of the best 
publications of the kind ever produced, and its 
reappearance is welcome. 

Two prime old favorites in new and pleasing but 
comparatively inexpensive dress " Ivanhoe " and 
"John Halifax, Gentleman" come to us from 
the J. B. Lippincott Co. In each, the more note- 
worthy added feature is the series of twelve colored 
illustrations, those in " Ivanhoe " being the work 
of Mr. Charles E. Brock, those in "John Halifax" 
of Messrs. Cooke, Fisher, and Tilney. All the 
plates have the effect of water-color drawings, and 
most of them are cleverly and intelligently done. 
In the " John Halifax " there is also a medallion 
portrait of Mrs. Craik, and a photographic view in 
Old Tewksbury. The volumes are printed and 
bound alike, and are evidently meant to be shelf 
companions. 

Dr. Johnson's " Rasselas," gotten out in neat and 
convenient form by Messrs. James Pott & Co., is 
the promising initial volume in the "Gem Classics " 
series which will include such works as the "Religio 
Medici," Beckford's " Vathek," Mrs. Gatty's "Par- 
ables from Nature," etc. We understand that about 
seven volumes of the series are now ready. The 
volume is a duodecimo, bound in limp Venetian 
morocco, and contains a good frontispiece portrait 
reproduced in photogravure. Its moderate price 
considered, the set is unusually well made and 
attractive. 

Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin's graceful colonial 
romance, " The Head of a Hundred " (Little, Brown 
& Co.), which we have already had occasion to 
commend, makes its appearance in tempting Holi- 
day dress, and with a half-dozen illustrations (the 
frontispiece in colors) from various hands. The 
volume forms a desirable gift-book of the more in- 
expensive class. 

Those popular companion books " Elizabeth and 
her German Garden " and " The Solitary Summer " 
reappear boxed together as a set and with added 
material attractions, notably twenty-eight beautiful 
photogravures, fourteen to the volume, which dis- 
close at least the home surroundings of the author, 
but leave us still guessing at her identity. The 
author's children appear in a few of the pictures, 
but even this possible clue proves deceptive, for 
the faces of the little ones are in each case either 
hidden or partly hidden through one pretty device 
or another. The remaining plates give some charm- 
ing glimpses of the garden and of the interior of 
the castle. (Macmillan Co.) 



Redolent of the quaint humor and simple pathos 
of the old-fashioned plantation " darky " are the 
twenty-four songs, each with its accompanying 
drawing, in Howard Weeden's " Songs of the Old 
South" (Doubleday, Page & Co.). The pictures, 
eight of which are printed in colors, show with a 
truth which there is no mistaking the Southern 
negro of the old time, and the book generally is 
made up with a view to the demands of the Holi- 
day season. 

" Loving Imprints : The Mother's Album " (Lee 
& Shepard), compiled by Mrs. Therese Goulston, 
is essentially a book of carefully prepared and ar- 
ranged blank forms for registering important family 
events births, betrothals, marriages, anniver- 
saries, deaths, and so forth for six generations. 
Provision for a pictorial element is made in the 
spaces reserved for unmounted photographs. The 
volume is the result of the editor's personal need 
of such a book, and it appears to be as practical and 
convenient as it is tastily got up. 

Abundant good taste is displayed in the get-up 
of Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.'s delicately bound 
volume entitled "In the Sweetness of Childhood." 
The compiler of the book, Miss Grace Hartshorne, 
has aimed to include in it the best available poems 
on the theme of childhood, omitting however some 
of the most hackneyed pieces in order to make 
room for selections which seem to her as meritori- 
ous, if less widely known, than the ones omitted. 
There are sixteen full-page illustrations, mostly 
after modern painters, which reflect the spirit, at 
least, of the text. 

Among recent successes in fiction, prominent 
place must be accorded those stirring and original 
tales by "Ralph Connor" entitled "Black Rock" 
and "The Sky Pilot." The sales of both books 
have passed the 50,000 mark, and their popularity 
shows no present signs of abatement. A welcome 
is therefore assured in advance to the handsome 
illustrated editions issued for the Holidays by the 
publishers, Fleming H. Revell Co. The eight 
drawings contained in each volume are the work 
of Mr. Louis Rhead, who has been fairly successful 
in depicting the vivid scenes of the narrative. The 
cover designs are uncommonly striking and effec- 
tive. 

That romantic old favorite " The Scottish Chiefs " 
(Button) appears in new and pleasing garb, the 
main feature of which is Mr. T. H. Robinson's 
copious illustrations, including a colored frontis- 
piece. The character of " Wight Wallace " has 
not gained through the researches of later histori- 
ans ; and it is pleasant to turn the page back and 
view Scotia's hero in the glamor of Miss Porter's 
time-honored pages. The attractive cover design 
in colors deserves a word of praise. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers reprint their ornate 
Holiday edition of " Daisy Miller" with the famil- 
iar drawings by Mr. Harry W. McVickar. A tasty 
lilac binding freshens up this favorite of a p as t 
season, which should find many admirers thi s year.

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

L 

Books for the coming generation reflect the luxury 
of the age to an extent which takes from them some- 
thing of their American flavor. This is especially true 
of the tales of school and contemporaneous life pro- 
vided for the reading of the year. Not so long ago 
the boys we read about were in comfortable pecuniary 
circumstances, nothing more. When they wished 
something by way of toy or implement for sport, they 
made it themselves whenever possible, or earned and 
saved money for purchasing it, being self-dependent in 
either case. Now, the boys seem to have many more 
things done for them. Their apparatus for enjoyment 
has been increased, though it is very doubtful if any 
higher degree of pleasure has come with it. The 
schools have boys with longer purses among their stu- 
dents, and the hero who begins as a poor, unnoticed lad 
with funny clothing made by the village tailor, devel- 
ops into the very young man of the world under the 
influence of the youths of wealth and fashion who asso- 
ciate with him. 

The subject of war is holding its prominent place of 
the last year or two, so far as the books for children are 
concerned. Many of these deal with events now pass- 
ing, such as the wars in South Africa and the Philip- 
pines. Many others go back to the small beginnings 
of the nation, as if seeking an antidote to the greater 
extravagance in expenditure of modern life even while 
they provide the nation with an historical perspective 
and its inhabitants with almost unsuspected ancestors. 
The highest praise, that of imitation, continues to be 
paid the creations of the late " Lewis Carroll," as seen 
in the multiplicity of books of the " Alice in Wonder- 
land" kind. Nature, too, occupies a growing part in 
the instruction of the young, the less we live in 
nature the more there being to tell about it for purposes 
of information. Of books which serve a useful end in 
history, and similar works, there is a plenty ; but a 
lack of real literary work is to be complained of, and 
the heroes of peace play a rather insignificant part in 
comparison with the heroes of war. The strenuous 
life's the thing, apparently, though the very books which 
tell of the past prove that we Americans have never 
required any encouragement to that end. The more 
frequent appearance of the Indian in boys' books this 
year tells the same story.

Story Book" (Longmans), compiled and edited by 
Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, with an abundance of

It is the fourth of a series dealing with English roy- 
alty and its scions, starting from the Norman Conquest 

and coming down to the reign of Victoria the Good 

The thousandth anniversary of the death of the Queen's 
most illustrious ancestor brings forth Dr. Eva March 
Tappan's " In the Days of Alfred the Great " (Lee & 
Shepard), with pictures by Mr. Kennedy. The author 
is a careful student of history in the fullest sense of 
the word, and has been enabled to add some excellent 
new anecdotes of a most interesting life to those already 
familiar. Another anniversary, and the consequent 
attention paid to the career of Cromwell, brings before 
the public Captain F. S. Brereton's "In the King's 
Service " (imported by Scribner), a rattling good tale 



of Cromwell's invasion of Ireland with the Parliament- 
ary army, the hero, Dick Granville, being on the other 
side. With "In the Irish Brigade, a Tale of the 
War in Flanders and Spain " (Scribner), our esteemed 
friend, Mr. George Alfred Henty, makes his fifth or 
sixth score bow to the younger reading population, 
with a stirring story of the early eighteenth century, 
when England was warring through the Low Coun- 
tries and Uncle Toby left it of record that the army 
swore terribly. Mr. Charles M. Sheldon, curiously 
duplicating the American clergyman's name, provides 
the striking illustrations. Of a milder and purely 
feminine sort, yet with its interest largely in the his- 
torical atmosphere which envelops the characters, Miss 
Sarah Tytler (Henrietta Keddie) writes " Queen Char- 
lotte's Maidens " (Scribner), a picturesque romance for 
older girls, but one to be commended on many ac- 
counts. Mr. Henty, never to be easily disposed of in 
such a reckoning as this, appears again with " Out with 
Garibaldi, a Story of the Liberation of Italy " (Scrib- 
ner), a book which brings the wish that wars for free- 
dom were more frequent in the real and the literary 
world alike. 

American history O n the hither side of the Atlantic, his-

Wars, " The Century Book of the American Colonies " 
(Century Co.) is a most interesting account of a jour- 
ney as personally conducted by Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks, 
extending from Maine to Louisiana by way of Florida, 
in which the young tourists have their cup of inquisi- 
tiveness regarding the early life of the country filled 
almost to overflowing. Plentiful illustrations from 
photographs, and a decorative cover by Mr. T. Guern- 
sey Moore, enhance the value of the book, which is a 
companion to a similar work treating of Revolutionary 
scenes published two years ago. " The House-Boat 
on the St. Lawrence ; or, Following Frontenac " (Lee 
& Shepard) is a story of similar design, and, also, the 
companion volume to a previous work, from the pleas- 
ant pen of Dr. Everett T. Tomlinson. The same boys, 
now a year older, who followed the trail of Cartier a 
twelvemonth ago, are now engaged with Frontenac's 
eventful history in the Canadian wilderness. It is 
worthily done. As the last of the four books of the 
"Young Puritans" series (Little, Brown, & Co.), " The 
Young and Old Puritans of Hatfield," written by Mrs. 
Mary P. Wells Smith and illustrated by Miss Bertha 
C. Day, proves the wealth of material which lies in the 
annals of every New England town of early founda- 
tion, here containing a most exciting account of the 
capture and rescue of some of the inhabitants of Hat- 
field at the end of King Philip's war. For still 
smaller children, Miss Edith Robinson has written " A 
Little Puritan's First Christmas" (Page), the little 
Puritan being the quaintly old-fashioned Betty Sewall, 
as she appears in her learned father's pious and juri- 
dical pages. The drawings, by Mrs. Amy M. Sacker, 
include a portrait of the small heroine.

days. The foundation for the story, however, rests in 
the unproved reason of Dr. Benjamin Church. Those 
who look in vain for the tale of the Boston boys who 
told General Gage what they thought of his soldiers 
will be relieved in knowing that this happened the year 
before Mr. Otis opens his narrative. " In the Hands 
of the Red Coats " (Houghton) is another of Dr. 
Everett T. Tomlinson's accounts of life in New Jersey 
during the war, founded on the veracious chronicle of 
Ebenezer Fox and fully described in its sub-title as 
" A Tale of the Jersey Ship and the Jersey Shore in 
the Days of the Revolution." The enormities of the 
British prison ships deserve setting forth at this time, 
and Dr. Tomlinson is to be commended for his work, 
though he has ameliorated the British excesses. The 
spirited pictures in the book are by Mr. Frank E. 

Schoonover " Scouting for Washington " (Little, 

Brown, & Co.) is another of Mr. John Preston True's 
books for boys, the scenes being laid in the South, and 
Sumter and Tarleton being prominent in the action of 
the time. Mr. Clyde O. De Land provides the illus- 
trations, and the work is particularly valuable as ac- 
counting for the fighting in a part of the country which 
has been neglected by most writers Mr. T. W. Hall's

loss of the " Philadelphia," and her subsequent 
destruction by the most distinguished " cutting out " 
party in our history of war afloat, abundantly justify 
the book's existence. Mr. Otis also prepares, from 
private papers in his possession, another volume of the 
"Privateers of 1812" series, "The Armed Ship 
America " (Estes), an account of an almost forgotten 
private venture of our old naval militia, and one which 
explains why England grew so anxious to have the 
second war of independence come to an end. The 
pictures are by Mr. J. W. Kennedy, strict attention 
being paid to historical exactitude Another little- 
remembered incident in our national growth is revived 
by Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks in "The Godson of Lafayette, 
a Story of the Days of Webster and Jackson " (Wilde). 
It deals with the curious delusion of the Rev. Eleazar 
Williams, who thought himself the lost Dauphin of 
France, and is here made to persuade the hero of the 
tale into discipleship. The drawings for the book are 
by Mr. Frank T. Merrill, and it forms the second vol- 
ume of the " Sons of the Republic " series. In his 
" Brethren of the Coast " (Scribner), Mr. Kirk Munroe 
has preserved the memory of Latrobe, the famous 
pirate of the Gulf, in a vivid narrative enhanced by the 
drawings of Mr. Rufus F. Zogbanm. The opportunity 
to use the battle of New Orleans,' in which Latrobe's 
band bore so gallant a part, is reserved, we hope, for 
a sequel. 

From the Among the books of war and history,

story has all the sincerity of history and the accuracy 
of an account by an eye-witness. So, too, the war for 
the liberation of Cuba seems to have lost its popularity. 
" In Defense of the Flag " (Lothrop) is concerned with 
the adventures of a boy in Spain at the outbreak of 
the war with the United States, written by Mr. Elbridge 
S. Brooks in his well-known manner. The young hero 
is on Admiral Cervera's ship when he crosses the 
Atlantic, and views the sea fight of July 3, 1898, off 
Santiago, from the other side. The story is most 
interesting. " The Adventures of a Boy Reporter " 
(Page) is the work of Mr. Harry Steele Morrison, be- 
ginning with a journey to Europe and ending with the 
reporter in the Philippines, where be has a series of 
experiences, including several with General Agninaldo. 
Excellent pictures have been made for the book by Mr. 
L. J. Bridgman. Mr. W. Irving Hancock, for some 
time the correspondent of " Frank Leslie's Weekly " 
in the Philippines, has embodied some of his informa- 
tion gained there in a book for boys called " Aguinaldo's 
Hostage ; or, Dick Carson's Captivity among the 
Filipinos" (Lee & Shepard). The life of the hero 
is saved by the patriot leader in person, and there is 
much that is lifelike in the story. " The Young 
Bandmaster " (Mershon Co.) is the fourth of the 
" Flag of Freedom " series, and Captain Ralph 
Bone hi 11 its author. The story is concerned with the 
fortunes of a non-combatant at the capture of San 
Juan and El Caney. 

Mr. Henty comes into the living present 
in his " With Buller in Natal ; or, A 
Born Leader " (Scribner), illustrated by 
the skillful pencil of Mr. W. Rainey. It is written 
from the strongest possible British point of view, and 
so glosses over the accounts given in America of Gen- 
eral Buller's movements that it hardly seems possible 
Mr. Henty can be serious. Captain F. S. Brereton is 
more fortunate in his choice of material when he writes 
" With Rifle and Bayonet, a Tale of the Boer War " 
(Scribner), since he gives his hero, Jack Somerton, a 
chance to be at the relief of Mafeking after that fine 
display of heroism and endurance. Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer writes and Mr. A. Burnham Shute illus- 
trates " Between Boer and Briton " (Lee & Shepard), 
the story of two cousins, one an English boy and the 
other an American, who get into the middle of things 
in South Africa and go through the war as far as the 
fall of Pretoria. Mr. James Otis's "Fighting for 
the Empire " (Estes) is rather a veracious history of 
the death of the two Dutch Republics. The nature of 
the work forces the author to rely upon the daily press 
for most of his more recent occurrences, but the effect 
is vivid nevertheless.

usual, it would seem, yet they are given 

more than their usual space in the books for boys and 
girls this fall. " A Child of the Sun " (Stone), by Mr. 
Charles Eugene Banks, is an excellent account of the 
doings of a little Indian lad, filled with knowledge of 
the manners of the aborigines and touched with not a 
little poetry. The pictures in color, by Mr. Louis 
Betts, make the book one of the handsomest among 
this year's publications. " Red Jacket, the Last of 
the Senecas " (Dutton) is from the well-known pen of 
Colonel H. R. Gordon, with pictures by Mr. W. M. 
Gary. It is suggestive of Cooper throughout, and 
more than a little exciting " The Sun Maid, a Story

of Fort Dearborn " (Dutton) is a tale of the Potta- 
watomies and whites on the site of what is now Chicago, 
written by Miss Evelyn Raymond and illustrated also 
by Mr. Gary. It seems centuries away in point of 
time. " The Prairie Schooner, a Story of the Black 
Hawk War" (Wilde) is by the Rev. William E. 
Barton, D.D., with pictures from the hand of Mr. 
H. Burgess. Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and 
other historical celebrities appear in the mildly thrilling 
pages. Mr. George Bird Grinnell resumes his inter- 
esting Indian tales in " Jack among the Indians " 
(Stokes), the drawings for which have been done by Mr. 
Edwin Willard Deming, carrying his young people 
up to the Assiniboine country, and finding time to shoot 
grizzlies and other interesting things on the way.

",The World's Discoverers, the Story of

by sea, and Mr. William Henry Johnson, the author, 
has been to great pains to make his book both instruct- 
ive and entertaining A similar service for those 

explorers who have travelled by land has been per- 
formed by Mr. Tudor Jenks in the " Boy's Book of 
Exploration (Doubleday), a companion volume to the 
interesting " Boy's Book of Invention " of a year ago. 
Africa occupies most of the book, but Australia is 
given a place and Asia has five chapters, one of them 
containing an account of Sven Hedin's wonderful jour- 
ney. Africa, too, is the scene of the curious incidents 
set forth in Mr. Paul du Chaillu's " The World of the 
Great Forest (Scribner), illustrated by Messrs. C. R. 
Knight and J. M. Gleeson. As the sub-title discloses, 
it is an account of " How Animals, Birds, Reptiles, In- 
sects, Talk, Think, Work, and Live," told in the 
sprightly and delectable manner of the well-known au- 
thor. " Under the Great Bear " (Doubleday) by Mr. 
Kirk Munroe, is of the more conventional type of boys' 
stories, with a youthful hero who does wonders along 
the northern Atlantic coast of America, a fight between 
British and French sailors in Newfoundland being one 
of the interesting episodes. The rush for gold to the 
northern Pacific coast finds a historian in Mr. Arthur 
K. Thompson, with "Gold Seeking on the Dalton 
Trail, being the Adventures of Two New England 
Boys in Alaska and the Northwest Territory " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). The story is evidently based on per- 
sonal experience, and contains much information con- 
cerning the natural history of the region. "A Tar of 
the Old School " (Estes) is one of Mr. F. H. Costello's 
well written combinations of fact and fiction, his hero 
doing many things but finding time to attend the burn- 
ing of the "Philadelphia" and the defeat of the 
" Macedonian " by the good frigate " United States." 
Mr. W. Clark Russell prepares a sea story more par- 
ticularly for boys in The Pretty Polly, a Voyage of 
Incident " (Lippincott). There is some well deserved 
commendation of Dana's " Two Years before the Mast " 
in the book, with the somewhat inexplicable statement 
that it contains a great deal of British humor. An 
interesting bit of information in one of the foot notes 
runs to the effect that Sidney Dickens, son of the nov- 
elist, who was drowned at sea, had been a schoolmate 



of the author -- " The Lobster Catchers, a Story of 
the Coast of Maine " (Dutton) is another of the inde- 
fatigable Mr. James Otis's books, dealing with a little- 
known industry in a manner both amusing and in- 
structive. 

Among the thoroughly useful books for 
w ^' clx deserve parental inspection 



and purchase are two by Mr. D. C. Beard, 
"The Outdoor Handy Book for Playground, Field, 
and Forest " and The Jack of All Trades, New Ideas 
for American Boys" (Scribner). These conclude a 
series of four volumes which are replete with good 
ideas for keeping youngsters out of mischief at the 
most mischievous age, and there is a fifth volume for 
the boys' sisters written by Mr. Beard's sisters. First 
of a new series to be named after " The United States 
Government " is a book called " The Treasury Club " 
(Wilde) by Mr. William Drysdale. It is an intelli- 
gently-written narrative in story form, the boy hero 
entering the federal treasury department and passing 
through its routine, meeting its responsible heads and 
gaining a comprehension of its workings, which he im- 
parts to his readers. The idea is both good in itself 
and commendably worked out. Mr. Charles Battell 
Loomis has never written a book for the young in years 
before, limiting his efforts in authorship to those who 
were young in mind. But his success in " Yankee En- 
chantments" (McClure, Phillips & Co.) is such that 
we hope the experiment will be repeated. All of his 
humor is preserved in this story of the modern Amer- 
ican sort of fairy, the wonderful genie who has made 
liquid air, trolley cars, and automobiles possible, and it 
may be read by children of all ages. Nearly two-score 
pictures by Miss Fanny Y. Cory heighten the pleasure 
to be gained from the book. Another fanciful book is 
"The Bicycle Highwaymen" (Estes), wherein Mr. 
Frank M. Bicknell writes of the Mayor of Cycleton and 
the trouble he and his fellow-functionaries are put to 
by the wheeled bandits in the neighborhood. " Jones 
the Mysterious " (Scribner) is the alluring title which 
Mr. Charles Edwardes invents for his account of the 
doings of Jimmy Jones, upon whom has been conferred 
the magic power of making himself invisible. The story 
is full of mild fun, its ideas being carried out ably in 
the pictures by Mr. Harold Copping Mr. William O. 
Stoddard achieves another success with " Ned, Son of 
Webb: What he Did " (Estes), an historically imagina- 
tive work in which the youngster who acts as hero, a 
typical American boy, is transported back to Harold 
Hardrada's invasion of England, remaining in those 
bygone ages long enough to bear a hand at the battle 
of Hastings. 

Of books for boys, books of the more 
conventional type, Mr. Andrew Home 
prepares a somewhat ordinary tale of 
English boyhood life with " The Story of a School Con- 
spiracy" (Lippincott), Mr. A. Monro furnishing the 
illustrations -- "True to Himself; or, Roger Strong's 
Struggle for Place " (Lee & Shepard) is by Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer, being the third volume of the " Ship and 
Shore " series. It has a preternatu rally acute boy who 
does more than twenty men could do in the way of un- 
earthing crime. Not more wonderful but still deserv- 
ing comment is " Rival Boy Sportsmen " (Lee & Shep- 
ard), for which Mr. W. Gordon Parker provides both 
text and drawings. It is the last of the " Deer Lodge ' 
series, and like its predecessors is filled with the doings 
of a number of wealthy schoolboys who row races for

solid gold vases and little things like that. Mr. James 
Otis can hardly have time to make a specialty of any 
one branch of books for the young, but he contrives to 
give us a sketch of a newsboy in "Aunt Hannah and 
Seth " (Crowell) which deserves commendation for be- 
ing about a real boy. Seth is in trouble nearly all of 
the time, but gets out of it boy-fashion, and then learns 
he need never have been in it much like the rest of 
us. A real "study " among foreign types in America 
is presented by Miss Anna Chapin Ray in " Playground 
Toni " (Crowell) the tale of an American ghetto with 
Toni Valovick for its protagonist. The book is filled 
with delicate pathos and humor, and is illuminating in 
more senses than one. 

The link usually missing between books 

specially written and designed for boys 
and for them. v J . i i j i 

and those intended exclusively for girls 

is supplied this year by Miss Jeannette L. Gilder's 
delightful "Autobiography of a Tomboy" (Double- 
day), with its charming pen and ink sketches by Miss 
Florence Scovel Shinn. The book is a literary pleas- 
ure, and one that both sexes and all ages can be 

cheered by A stronger and more mature work than 

most is Miss Alice Stronach's " A Newnham Friend- 
ship " (Scribner), a book which begins with a little 
Highland girl in the woman's college at Cambridge 
and ends in one of the London social settlements. A 
romance enters into the story, greatly to its advantage. 
A sensible plea for something better than a life be- 
hind a shop counter is made in Miss Evelyn Ray- 
mond's " Reels and Spindles " (Wilde), with illustra- 
tions by Mr. Frank T. Merrill. A young girl brought 
up to the best things in life is compelled to face reali- 
ties and does it in a way that must win respect, going 
to work in a mill at last, and finding herself able to be 
of real service there to her fellows. Mingling city and 
country life and city and country folk, Miss Gabrielle 
E. Jackson's " Pretty Polly Perkins " (Century Co.), 
with its pictures by Mr. C. M. Relyea, shows how 
much broader the double experience makes the two 
interesting heroines. The lame little city girl who 
gains health and strength in the New England village 
takes the artistically inclined Polly into the metropolis 
during the winter, greatly to her advantage intellectu- 
ally "Randy's Summer" (Lee & Shepard) is writ- 
ten and illustrated by Miss Amy Brooks, and her four- 
teen-year-old heroine and her pretty sister Prue do 
good during their holidays as well as find recreation of 
the more usual sort. Those who recall Miss Anna 
Chapin Ray's " Teddy" will be glad to meet that pleas- 
ant personality once more in a sequel called " Phebe : 
Her Profession," a quaint and happy story of girls who 
realize that life is not all cakes and ale. Mr. Frank 
T. Merrill makes the pictures for the volume, which is 
published by Little, Brown, & Co. Mrs. L. T. Meade 
justifies anew the criticism that she can get more 
healthy excitement out of a girl's rather monotonous 
life than any one else by her " Miss Nonentity " ( Lip- 
pincott), illustrated by Mr. W. Rainey. It is a kindly 
book, like all of Mrs. Meade's, and one which shows 
an interest in some life not usually regarded as inter- 
esting. "Brenda, her School and her Club" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) is written by Miss Helen Leah Reed 
and illustrated by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith. It is 
occupied with school life in and around Boston, a col- 
lege football game and the interest it excites going to 
show that a generation of women is growing up 
which will feel more kindly toward that masculine 



amusement. " Almost as Good as a Boy " (Lee & 
Shepard) is one of Miss Amanda M. Douglas's books 
for girls, wholesome and sane and full of interest, as 
all her books are. Miss Amy Blanchard tells a tale 
with mingled pathos and fun in " Her Very Best " 
(Lippincott), Miss Margaret F. Winner furnishing the 
illustrations. The closer contact of Europe and 
America is told in a manner almost whimsical by Miss 
A. G. Plympton in " A Child of Glee " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.). It tells of a little Yankee girl who gets en- 
tangled in the politics and diplomacy of a European 
court, and comes out with credit to herself, her father, 
and her fellow countrymen. "A Georgian Bungalow " 
(Hough ton) is to be welcomed, like others of Mrs. 
Frances Courtenay Baylor's books, for the understand- 
ing it gives of southern life and fancies. Negro fidel- 
ity and a picturesque German governess add to the 
interest of the story, which is well illustrated. Mrs. 
Molesworth's "The House that Grew" (Macmillan) 
turns out to be a wagonette, and the pictures by Miss 
Alice Woodward make the story one to be laughed 
with and over in every respect. It has all the author's 
established knowledge of girl life. 

Before passing to the books designed 

an<t V fablt* ^ or very sma ^ S^ s an( ^ boys, we must 

take note of the number of interesting 
fairy tales which can be read with delight by all who 
have not let work and the daily grind of life interfere 
too much with their imaginations. Mr. Andrew Lang 
has edited this year " The Grey Fairy Book " 
(Longmans), carrying on his chromatic scheme another 
step. The stories are from translations made by many 
hands and are illustrated by Mr. A. J. Ford. Mr. 
William Canton, whose original work for children has 
won so many golden opinions, acts as editor for a series 
of " The True Annals of Fairy Land " (Macmillan), the 
initial volume being entitled specifically " The Reign 
of King Herla." The occurrences of that momentous 
stretch of years requires a skilled anachronist for 
chronicler, since the Argonauts and King Lear both 
find a place between its opening and close. The de- 
lightful drawings of Mr. Charles Robinson make the 
book an ideal one either for keeping or giving away. 
Between Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright's delicate sense of 
humor in prose and Mr. Oliver Herford's delicious no- 
tion of fun in drawings, " The Dream Fox Story Book " 
(Macmillan) fares sumptuously according to its kind. 
There is fun enough in every page to make the reader 
wish he had the dream fox habit himself. Mr. 
Seumas MacManus and Mr. Frank Verbeck combine to 
make " Donegal Fairy Stories " (McClure, Phillips & 
Co.) a rollicking bit of Irish exaggeration, carrying it 
almost to the point of burlesque. More discrimina- 
ting by far is Mr. William Henry Frost's " Fairies and 
Folk of Ireland " (Scribner), which has the real Celtic 
flavor. We are somewhat at a loss to account for the 
use here of some of Mr. William Butler Yeats's tender 
imaginings, much as they endance the feeling to which 
the book is committed. Another of the great families 
of the Celtic race is drawn upon for the material in 
"Fairy Stories from the Little Mountain" (Wessels), 
which Mr. John Finnemore has brought together and 
Mr. James R. Sinclair made pictures for. The tales 
are Welsh and quaintly enjoyable, both in text and 
picture. Miss Katharine Elise Chapman uses the ma- 
chinery of "A Midsummer- Night's Dream" with much 
skill in her " A Fairy Night's Dream; or, The Horn of 
Oberon " (Laird & Lee). The book is an exquisite one

with a colored frontispiece and many other pictures by 
Mr. Gwynne Price. "The Pixie and Elaine Stories" 
(Estes), by Miss Carrie E. Morrison, are imaginative 
descriptions of the doings of the " Pixies " who live in 
country streams, and the "Elaines" who inhabit a 
lovely little lake. Pretty drawings by Mr. Reginald 
Birch and other artists of skill reinforce the pleasant 
impression the book leaves upon the reader's mind. 

That dreamlike confusion of the actual 
Impossible and tbe i mpo88 ibl e which was so peculi- 

realities, . f , r 

arly the invention or the late " Lewis 

Carroll " has its counterpart in many a volume put out 
this year. Mr. L. Frank Baum frankly acknowledges 
his obligations to his more original predecesssor in " A 
New Wonderland" (Russell), with its quaint pictures 
by Mr. Frank Verbeck. But Mr. Dodgson bad a real 
distinction of style which is wholly lacking here, though 
to be found in a chapter or two of Mr. Baum's other 
book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz " (Hill), which 
is remarkably illustrated by Mr. William W. Denslow, 
who possesses all the originality of method which has 
been denied his collaborator. This last book is really 
notable among the innumerable publications of the 
year, making an appeal which is fairly irresistible to a 
certain standard of taste Fastidious tastes will place 
Miss Katharine Pyle's " The Christmas Angel " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) at the other end of the aesthetic scale, 
the unity of conception of the artist-author being in its 
favor. Though intended for little children, it can be 
read with real comprehension by their elders for all the 
odd little turns of thought through which it wanders to 
a happy close. " Josey and the Chipmunk " (Century 
Co.) is the result of Mr. Sydney Reid's pen and Miss 
Fanny Cory's pencil, and includes a large menagerie 
among its dramatis personie. It is both clever and droll. 
Animals from life, qualified by a vivid pictorial 
imagination, fill up the pages of " The Jumping Kanga- 
roo and the Apple Butter Cat" (McClure, Phillips & 
Co.) for which Mr. James M. Conde* has made the 
illustrations and Mr. John W. Harrington written the 
text. The book is unusually well done Mr. Living- 
ston B. Morse makes up a story of fantasy in his " The 
Road to Nowhere " (Harper), Mrs. Edna Morse sup- 
plying the illustrations. A candy farm and a parlia- 
ment of peacocks are among the strange things to be 
read of in the book.

library devoted to them this Christmas. 

Of real value is Miss Abbie FarwelFs " The Book of 
Saints and Friendly Beasts" (Houghton), a most inter- 
esting collection from the Acta Sanctorum of the stories 
of friendliness which exists between men of peace and 
holiness and the rest of the animate world. Miss 
Fanny Y. Cory carries out the mediaeval feeling of the 
tales in her cleverly conventionalized drawings, and 
the whole effect is one to rejoice in. A wide world 
away is Mr. Joaquin Miller's " True Bear Stories " 
(Rand, McNally & Co.), a volume which the author's 
active imagination relieves from any charge of being 
merely true. The book is fully illustrated, and fortu- 
nate in having an introduction written for it by Dr. 
David Starr Jordan. " The Animal Alphabet " (Hill) 
contains prose and verse written by Mr. Henry Morrow 
Hyde and a full series of pictures from photographs 
taken from life by Mr. Charles C. Cook. The book is 
entertaining, but the photographs lose effect owing 
to the process adopted. Mr. Ernest Seton-Thompson's 



"Wild Animal Play" (Doubleday) utilizes the charac- 
ters from the author's successful book, "Wild Animals 
I Have Known," with pictures and rhymes by his own 
hand. But it is very thin, and can be satisfactory to 
none but small children. " Mooswa and Others of the 
Boundaries " (Scribner) is a book of the genre of Mr. 
Kipling's "Jungle Stories," written by Mr. W. A. 
Fraser, and illustrated by Mr. Arthur Heming. The 
scenes are laid in the far North of the Athabasca and 
Saskatchewan, and are of more than ordinary merit. 
Lovers of dogs and who is not? will profit and 
smile at once in perusing the " Observations of Jay (A 
Dog), and Other Stories " (Elder & Shepard) by Mr. 
Morgan Shepard, with its most interesting introductory 
essay on the " Five Great Wags " of a dog's tail. 

Of old books made new the season brings 

at least three f a hi h order of merit ' 
" The Adventures of Odysseus " (Dut- 

ton) is an alluring volume with a colored frontispiece 
and illustrations by Mr. Charles Robinson, the free 
translations of episodes from the Odyssey being done 
by Messrs. F. S. Marvin, R. J. C. Mayor and F. M. 
Stawell. The spirit of the original has been fairly 
caught and held in so far as a translation can hold it, 

and the book is a worthy one in all respects Messrs. 

G. W. Boden and W. Barrington d'Almeida have done 
a similar good service for another Greek in " Wonder 
Stories from Herodotus" (Harper). A tribute to the 
veracity of the Father of History is deserved, after all 
the generations to which he was only the Father of 
Lies. The illustrations, reproduced in colors from de- 
signs by Mr. H. Granville Fell, possess a rare artistic 
beauty. The Rev. A. J. Church, M.A., in " Helmet 
and Spear " (Macmillan) gathers into a single volume 
accounts of ancient wars, beginning with Greece and 
Persia and ending with the taking of Rome by the bar- 
barians and the fall of the empire. The book is vividly 
written and fully illustrated. 

Of the old favorites reprinted in new

satisfactory to the lover of good books as 

the large quarto of " Fairy Tales and Stories " (Cen- 
tury Co.), translated from the Danish of Hans Christian 
Andersen by Mr. H. L. Braekstad and beautifully illus- 
trated by Mr. Hans Tegner. It commemorates nothing 
except the perennial affection in which this prince of 
story tellers is regarded, giving his jewels a setting 
worthy their merits. " Robinson Crusoe " appears in 
two editions, one published by Mr. R. H. Russell with 
pictures by the brothers Louis and Frederick Rhead, 
but without the European ending to the adventures of 
Defoe's hero; and one with a colored frontispiece and 
rubricated pages throughout, published by Dodd, Mead 
& Co., the story reprinted in full. Both are joys for 

older hands than boys to delight in A more than 

ordinary edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's " Treasure 
Island " (Scribner), that modern Robinson Crusoe tale, 
is finely set off by Mr. Wai Paget's pictures. The map 
whose loss gave its author such trouble is carefully re- 
produced. Stevenson's " A Child's Garden of Verse " 
(Russell) is nothing less than gorgeous in its new dress, 
with pictures in colors by Messrs. E. Marr and M. H. 
Squire. Charles Kingsley's "Water Babies" (Wes- 
sels) has many full- page color pictures by Mr. G. 
Wright, the wonderful folk under the sea and in the 
rivers becoming grotesquely decorative under his skill- 
ful treatment. The separate editions, published last

Looking Glass," with the clever illustrations in colors

in one pair of covers (Wessels), making a singularly 
attractive volume. 

Richness for both young and old lies in a 
numerous class of books which many a 
fond parent will buy in order to have it 
himself upon occasion. Such a book will be found in 
" Chinese Mother Goose Rhymes" (Revell), translated 
and illustrated by Mr. Isaac Taylor Headland of the 
University of Pekin. Quaint and curious as it is, it can- 
not be read by the least observant without the assurance 
that the Chinese are strangely human, all reports to the 
contrary notwithstanding. The accuracy of the trans- 
lation being vouched for, it is impossible to conceive of 
any vast or any essential difference between nations 
whose children delight in exactly the same turns of 

thought and fancy Mrs. Alice Archer Sewall writes 

the verses and makes the drawings for " The Ballad of 
the Prince " (Russell), a delightfully humorous bit of 
work which requires some age to appreciate its mani- 
fold merits, quickly as a child will grasp the surface 
meaning. This is no less true of Mr. Gellett Burgess's 
enjoyable " Goops and How to be Them, a Manual of 
Manners for Polite Infants Inculcating Many Juvenile 
Virtues both by Precept and Example " (Stokes). The 
author has made ninety drawings for his book, and the 
cheerful Goop may be seen in all his undoubted strength 
and vigor. The words and pictures which Mr. T. E. 
Butler has invented for " Nanny " (Russell), a goat 
which makes successive functionaries " perfectly (and 
excusably) furious," will bring a smile of innocence to 
the wrinkled cheek of age. Twenty-four colored pic- 
tures by Miss Grace A. May illustrate the " Proverbs 
Improved" (John Lane) for which Mr. Frederic Chap- 
man has made some plaintive verses. They will while 
away a few minutes with some profit. A story of a 
family that will interest more than one generation is 
Miss Annie C. Brown's "Fireside Battles" (Laird & 
Lee), a book for which Mr. Joseph C. Leyendecker has 
provided some brilliantly designed illustrations. A 
carefully selected anthology of " Lullabys and Baby 
Songs " (Dutton) has been compiled by Mrs. Adelaide 
L. J. Gossett, with some charming pictures by Miss Eva 
Roos. The younger poets have been drawn upon to an 
extent unusual in such books, but there is nothing from 
Stevenson an omission which should have been ex- 
plained. 

Books of the epicene sort which do for 
readert 3 small girls and boys as well are a-many. 
"Mother Nature's Children" (Ginn) is 
written by Mr. Allen Walton Gould with a view to 
showing how things grow, whether vegetable or animal, 
the processes of nature being portrayed by abundant 
illustrations. "The Story of a Little Beech Tree" 
(Dutton), by Miss Esther Harlan, is rather the story of 
little Harold and his surroundings. He is fortunate in 
making the acquaintance of a Mr. Man, who does not 
paint his house or wooden fences because he prefers 

beauty to everything else " Farmer Brown and the 

Birds" (Page) is by Miss Frances Margaret Fox, with 
illustrations by Miss Etheldred B. Barry. It shows how 
much a farmer may learn to his own advantage con- 
cerning birds. Miss Barry illustrates Miss Harriet A. 
Cheever's "Ted's Little Dear" (Estes), the "little 
dear" being a King Charles spaniel which is lost as dogs 
always are in children's books. Miss Gertrude Smith, 
author of the " Arabella aud Araminta " stories of 



a year or two ago, prepares " The Booboo Book " 
(Estes), for which Messrs. C. F. Relyea and Frank T. 
Merrill furnish the drawings. Mr. William H. Pott 
writes some fanciful little sketches of white and col- 
ored folks in " Stories from Dreamland " (James Pott 
& Co.), Mr. George W. Bard well contributing the pic- 
tures. The stories abound in humor and pathos, though 

evidently the work of no practised hand The fifth 

volume of the " Little Prudy's Children " series, by 
Miss Sophie May, is called " Jimmy, Lucy, and All " 
(Lee & Shepard). It is astonishing how this series 
holds its popularity year after year, proving with 
every new volume a profound knowledge of the childish 

heart Miss Penn Shirley, " Sophie May's sister," 

writes and Miss C. Louise Williams illustrates " Boy 
Donald " (Lee & Shepard), a continuation of " The 
Happy Six." It has a monkey and a parrot in it, without 
prejudice to either. Miss Margaret Sidney continues 
her former successes with " The Adventures of Joel 
Pepper" (Lothrop), with pictures by Mr. Sears 
Gallagher. The harum-scarum lad who lends his name 
to the story is already an old favorite. What a 
youthful college graduate can do in the way of bring- 
ing some untamed youngsters under training is told 
with much spirit and good nature by Miss Mary 
Leonard in " Half a Dozen Thinking Caps " (Crowell). 
The book is suggestive. The author of " Miss 
Toosey's Mission " has written a book for little children 
called "Tom's Boy" (Little, Brown, & Co.). Small 
though it is, it will make a deep impression on the 
minds of its readers. Little Rita and Jimmy, the 
" Two Little Street Singers " (Lee & Shepard) of Mrs. 
Nora A. M. Roe's new book, have a hard time before 
they come into their own, and will carry the sympathies 

of many a small reader with them In Miss Evelyn 

Raymond's " Divided Skates " (Crowell) a little boy 
and girl open the heart of a nice old lady who has been 
permitting a poodle to monopolize her affections. Mrs. 
Frances Bent Dillingham writes a series of tales for 
little children around the great feasts of the American 
year, beginning with the greatest of them all, and calls it 
" The Christmas-Tree Scholar, a Book of Days "(Crow- 
ell ) A little moral running through each story does it 
no harm. "Ednah and her Brothers" (Houghton) 
is a series of short household stories, simple and inter- 
esting and creditable to their author, Miss Eliza Orne 
White. Something in the nature of a genuinely spon- 
taneous American child's garden is evolved by the wit 
of the heroine of Mrs. Ella Farman Pratt's " The Play 
Lady" (Crowell), who is left motherless and with a 
house quite her own but without money. The book 
has more value than the customary story for children. 
Mr. Frank Samuel Child carries on the curious ma- 
chinery of his last year's " House with Sixty Closets " 
with " The Little Dreamer's Adventure " (Lee & 
Shepard), and makes the book fully justify its sub- 
title of " A Story of Droll Days and Droll Doings." 
Many pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. C. H. L. Gebfert 
carry on the story's intention. Real feeling lies behind 
the narrative of " Snow White ; or, The House in the 
Wood " (Estes). Miss Laura E. Richards's pen and Mr. 
Frank T. Merrill's pencil here combine to convey a 
lesson in humanity of some moment. Miss Myra 
Sawyer Hamlin's "Nan's Chicopee Children" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) is a continuation of two former books, 
and opens with the return of the sick and wounded 
from the Spanish war. It is intended for somewhat 
older boys and girls, and is bright and filled with con-

versation. It is eight years since " John Howard 
Jewett " (who is really Miss Hannah Warner) wrote 
and Mr. Culmer Barnes illustrated the book to which 
" More Bunny Stories " (Stokes) is the sequel. So 
original and innocent a story could not fail to find 
hundreds of admirers then, and as many may be pre- 
dicted for its successor now. Mrs. Lily F. Wessel- 
hoeft has done the greatest possible good with her 
pretty stories of animals, birds, and children, giving 
the little human people some comprehension of their 
fellow beings and their feelings and sympathies. 
"Doris and her Dog Rodney " (Little, Brown, & Co.) 
is a continuation of former successors, with a fine An- 
gora cat named " Christopher Columbus " added for 
good measure. "A Little American Girl in India " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) is a travel story for quite small 
children, written by Miss Harriet A. Cheever and illus- 
trated by Mr. H. C. Ireland. It will give a good idea 
of the Orient to the child, and the long sea voyage to 
England and thence to Bombay is pleasantly described. 
Books having their chief interest in the

which is growing rather than grown, are

and verse, being written by Mrs. Eva Eickemeyer 
Rowland. It is the sort of book which was quite 
impossible a few years ago, and is still of more than 
passing interest. Some of the songs in the book 

have been supplied with music Geese of one sort 

and another are commanding an almost Roman re- 
gard. " Mother Goose Cooked " (John Lane) is by 
Messrs. John H. Myrtle and Reginald Rigby, and the 
verses and pictures are calculated to add to the gayety 
of nations. "Baby Goose: His Adventures" (Laird 
& Lee) is by Miss Fannie E. Ostrander, with full-page 
illustrations in color. It is jingly and humorous, all 
that it set out to be. " Mother Wild Goose and her 
Wild Beast Show " (H. M. Caldwell Co.) is the work 
of Mr. L. J. Bridgman, both text and pictures in color. 
It deserves popularity. "Mr. Bunny: His Book" 
(Saalfield Publishing Co.) would be highly original if 
it had not drawn nearly all its suggestions from " Father 
Goose: His Book," published last year. The rhymes 
are by Miss Adah L. Sutton and the colored pictures 
by Mr. W. H. Fry. The Urchins of the Sea" (Long- 
mans) described by Miss Marie Overton Corbin and 
Mr. Charles Buxton Going, with pictures in plenty by 
Mr. F. I. Bennett, are not urchins in the sea sense at 
all, but shark's eggs and hippocampuses in fine profu- 
sion. They are quaint and funny for all that. Miss 
Bertha Upton's verses and Miss Florence K. Upton's 
colored pictures make " The Golliwogg's Polar Adven- 
tures " (Longmans) much more pleasant reading than 
such chilly experiences usually are at this time of the 

year " The Bandit Mouse, and Other Tales " (Rand, 

McNally & Co.) is the combination of Mr. W. A. 
Frisbie's verses and the pictures of "Bart," telling 
some funny tales of an impossible but desirable animal 
world. " Uncle Pelican " will rank with Lear's famous 
King. Miss S. Rosamond Praeger gives a wonderful 
history in "The Tale of the Little Twin Dragons" 
(Macmillan) of a brother and sister who seek and find 
adventure while looking for the lost prince. Old- 
fashioned and picturesque, the verses of Mr. G. Orr 
Clark and the pictures of Miss Helen Hyde make " The 



Moon Babies " (Russell) a book to be treasured. It 
has positive merits both in conception and execution. 

For the babies, Miss Maud Humphrey 
reader 1 '* 3 * ^ as raa< ^ e some beautiful designs in color, 

using the dresses of an earlier day and 
calling the book " Children of the Revolution " (Stokes). 
The stories and verses written around the pictures are 
by Miss Mabel Humphrey. The famous scenes of 
1776 are reproduced with great humor and good will. 
" Droll Doings " (Scribner) abounds in pictures by 
Mr. Harry B. Neilson, with verses by " the Cockiolly 
Bird," of which the book tells in some detail. It is 
cleverly done. " Fiddlesticks " (Young) does not 
take its name from anything in particular, being a 
series of colored drawings done by Miss Hilda Cowham 
for such well-known jingles as " This Little Pig Went 
to Market." The work is excellent of its kind. A 
very small book for very small children is Miss Sophie 
Swett's " The Littlest One of the Browns " (Estes), a 
story about a little girl who was pretty good, but not too 

good "Sunday Reading for the Young, 1901" 

(Young) is the pleasant miscellany it has been for 
many years, piously inteutioned and religiously ex- 
ecuted Of the new volume of " Chatterbox " (Estes) 

it is not necessary to do more than mention the name. 
The generation that was not brought up on it is rapidly 
slipping away. " Soap Bubble Stories for Children " 
(James Pott & Co.) is a treasury of stories, historical 
and other, written by Miss Fanny Barry, with pictures 
by Mr. Irving Montagu. 

With a book or two of verses or music 

fwrfcoi or both the lon list ends - From the 

pages of " St. Nicholas " have been gath- 
ered the " St. Nicholas Book of Plays and Operettas " 
(Century Co.), which contains a number of things 
worth doing, Mr. Henry Baldwin's " Ballad of Mary 
Jane," a shadow play illustrated by silhouettes, not the 

least among them "A Visit to Santa Glaus" 

(Jennings & Pye) is a musical cantata, the libretto by 
Mr. J. W. Carpenter and the music by Mr. Charles H. 

Gabriel " Pretty Picture Songs for Little Folks " 

(H. F. Chandler) takes its words from various sources, 
all of them classical among children, appropriate music 
being supplied by Mr. G. A. Grant-Schaefer. The pic- 
tures scattered through the score by Mr. Walt M. 
De Kalb are original and clever. Of more than ordinary 
interest are some small stanzas for little fellows, done 
by Miss Helen Hay with Mr. Frank Verbeck's clever 
animal pictures, and named " The Little Boy Book " 
(Russell). Miss Hay is evidently preparing to take 
her place among the better-known writers of the day, 
her work here, slight as it is, showing both skill and 
painstaking, in addition to considerable talent. 



MR. LEWIS E. GATES is one of the most promising 
of our younger critics, and the quality already revealed 
in his studies of Arnold and Newman will have predis- 
posed the public to welcome the volume of " Studies 
and Appreciations " (Macmillan) which he has now 
put forth. The essays in this volume are ten in num- 
ber, discussing such writers as Tennyson, Hawthorne, 
Poe, and Charlotte Bronte, such subjects as " The 
Romantic Movement " and " Impressionism and Ap- 
preciation." They are well worthy of attention. We 
must thank him for the word which he gives us of Sir 
Lewis Morris when he calls that industrious rhymer 
the " God-gifted hand-organ voice of England."

NOTES. 



" King Henry V." is the latest volume in the " Swan " 
edition of Shakespeare, published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 

The American Book Co. send us a volume of the 
" Selected Letters of Voltaire," as edited for school 
use by Mr. L. C. Syms. 

Mr. W. R. Jenkins has just published a " Praktischer 
Lehrgang fUr den Unterricht der Deutschen Sprache," 
the work of Mr. Hermann Schulze. 

Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. publish a volume of 
"Nature Studies," consisting of selections from the 
writings of John Ruskin, made by Miss Rose Porter. 

" Episodes from Alexandra Dumas's Monte- Cristo," 
edited by Mr. I. H. B. Spiers, is a recently published 
French text with the imprint of Messrs. D. C. Heath 
&Co. 

" Greek History," by Professor Heinrich Swoboda, 
translated by Mr. Lionel D. Barnett, is the latest of 
the " Temple Primers " with the Dent-Macmillan 
imprint. 

A volume of the " Literary Essays of Thomas Bab- 
ington Macaulay," containing six numbers, edited by 
Mr. George A. Watrous, is published by Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. 

Volume XII. of the larger " Temple " Shakespeare 
(Dent-Macmillan) contains the poems and sonnets, 
together with a life of the poet, and completes this 
highly satisfactory edition. 

Messrs. Crane & Co., Topeka, are the publishers 
of " Economics," a school and college text-book by 
Dr. Frank W. Blackmar. The volume contains over 
five hundred pages of matter, and, being rather con- 
densed in statement, covers an unusual extent of 
ground. 

Nos. 104 to 111 of the " Old South Leaflets " come 
to us bound together into a pamphlet. They have for 
their general subject " The United States in the Nine- 
teenth Century," and include papers by Jefferson, 
Calhoun, Lincoln, Horace Mann, Rufus Choate, and 
Kossuth. 

" The Chord," which is an English quarterly peri- 
odical devoted to the art of music, begins its second 
year with the number dated September, and just re- 
ceived by us. It is imported by the A. Wessels Co., 
and differs from most periodicals in the fact that each 
number, a small quarto in size, is neatly bound in 
boards. 

"The Immortal," "Thirty Years in Paris," and 
" Little What's His Name," together with a number of 
minor pieces, form the contents of three new volumes 
in the library edition of Daudet published by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. Mr. George Burnham Ives is 
the translator of the first two of these volumes, and 
Miss Jane Minot Sedgwick of the third. 

Volumes III., V., and VI. of " The World's Orators," 
edited by Dr. Guy Carleton Lee, have just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. Volume III. 
includes orators of the early and mediaeval church, with 
examples of such men as St. Paul, Origen, Athanasius, 
the Gregories, Augustine, Anselm, and St. Bernard. 
Volume V. includes orators of modern Europe, with 
examples from Mirabeau, Napoleon, Lamartine, Kos- 
suth, Mazzini, Castelar, Bismarck, and others. Volume 
VI. is devoted to English orators before 1800, and 



includes among many names those of Bacon, Eliot, 
Strafford, Cromwell, Walpole, Burke, the Pitts, Fox, 
and Sheridan. The numerous portrait illustrations 
constitute a particularly attractive feature of these 
handsome volumes. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. send us three French 
texts that are sure of a welcome. Professor E. E. 
Brandon is the editor of an abridgment of " Le Comte 
de Monte- Cristo," and Professor E. S. Lewis has 
edited (but without abridgment) " La Tulipe Noire." 
Our third text is a " Histoire de France," extracted 
from the courses of M. Ducoudray by Professor O. B. 
Super. 

The American Book Co. publish the " Elements of 
Physics," as prepared for high schools by Professors 
Henry A. Rowland and Joseph S. Ames. It is a for- 
tunate thing that writers of such eminence are willing 
to devote their attention to elementary manuals of this 
sort, and the book again reminds us how much better 
off is the science teacher of to-day than was his prede- 
cessor of not many years -ago. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett, & Co. publish a volume en- 
titled " Ballads of American Bravery," and edited by 
Mr. Clinton Scollard. How strictly up-to-date is the 
selection is shown by the fact that it includes such 
recent poets as Mr. Wallace Rice and Mr. Barrett East- 
man, such recent themes as Santiago and Manila. But 
the older poets and the older heroisms are by no means 
neglected. The editor had the uses of schools in mind 
when he made this collection, but others than teachers 
will be glad to have it. 

Professor J. B. Bury's " History of Greece to the 
Death of Alexander the Great," published by the 
Macmillan Co., achieves the difficult aim of being 
equally valuable for the college student and for the 
general reader. The author is an accomplished scholar 
as well as the master of a dignified style, and the nine 
hundred pages of his work leave little to be desired as 
to either content or form. The illustrations, although 
not numerous, are judiciously chosen, and add much to 
the value of the work. 

Still another " Source Book of English History " has 
just been published. It is the work of Miss Elizabeth 
Kimball Kendall, and bears the imprint of the 
Macmillan Co. Designed for students and general 
readers alike, it is evident that an important aim of the 
work is to provide a suitable collection of source ma- 
terial for use in connection with the manual of English 
history which Miss Kendall prepared a year or two 
ago in collaboration with Miss Coman, her fellow 
instructor in Wellesley College. It should be promptly 
introduced into all the schools that make use of that 
admirable text-book. 

We have received from the Oxford University Press 
a copy of their " two-version " edition of the Bible, a 
publication which gives the text of the Authorized 
Version, and, in the margin of each page, all of the 
alterations, down to the minutest detail of punctuation, 
made by the scholars to whom we owe the Revised 
Version. This arrangement obviates the vexatious 
necessity of consulting two volumes at the same time, 
and will be welcomed by Bible workers of every sort. 
The volume is otherwise a wonder of book-making, 
being printed on Oxford India paper, the 1384 pages, 
together with the indexed atlas, making a volume of 
about one inch in thickness. It is bound in flexible 
seal, with gold edges.

THE DIAL 



In NATURE'S 
REALM 

By DR. CHARLES C. ABBOTT, 

Author of "Upland and Meadoiu" "Notes 
of the Night," "Outings at Odd Times," etc. 
ILLUSTRATED BY OLIVER KEMP. 
With a photogravure frontispiece and ninety drawings, 
8vo, hand-sewed, broad margins, extra superfine, dull- 
surfaced, pure cotton-fibre paper, deckle edges, gilt top, 
and picture-cover in three tints and gold ; 309 pp., fully 
indexed. Price, #2.50 NET. 

PRESS NOTICES. 

He writes delightfully. Courant (Hartford). 

An artistic work. . . . Delightful . . . instructive. Constitution 
(Atlanta). 

A book to be treasured. Serenely philosophical, keenly observ- 
ant, 'intellectually suggestive, the placid marshalling of the less 
obvious facts of nature, with their gentle spiritual interpretation from 
Dr. Abbott's pen to make us all human together, is a real triumph of 
literature. The Dial (Chicago). 

It is a delight equally to the outward eye and "that inward eye 
which is the bliss of solitude." Hetald (Taunton). 

The great thing about his essays and sketches on his rambling 
excursions is their unfailing charm. Herald (Boston). 

He is in close touch with Nature. He is acquainted with her varying 
moods. Spy (Worcester). 

A beautiful book that will delight every lover of Nature in its quiet 
haunts. . . . The book is an educator in its best meaning to old and 
young alike. Inter Ocean (Chicago). 

Dr. Abbott has long held an honored place among the few true 
lovers of nature whom she has .blessed with the gift of telling to others 
the secrets she betrays only to her votaries, the delights she gives 
freely to those who will search for them diligently, with eyes to see 
and ears to hear. . . . These studies gain by a second reading, and a 
third, as does their reader. The illustrator must be in close touch 
with Nature himself; he certainly is with his author, the charm of 
^whose text he interprets with rare felicity. Mail and Express (N.Y.) 

Not long ago, in reviewing Mr. Wishart's important history of 
"Monks and Monasteries," The Times had occasion to speak of the 
dignified form which had been given to the book by a new publisher, 
Albert Brandt, of Trenton. From the Brandt press we have now 
another noteworthy volume, presenting the work of a familiar author, 
but presenting it with a richness of external form it has not had 
before. This is " In Nature's Realm," by Dr. Charles C. Abbott. All 
readers are familiar with Dr. Abbott's sympathetic nature studies. 
He is one of those men, like White of Selborne, who do not need to 
go far afield to find matter to interest them ; to whom the woods and 
meadows, the streams and the skies of their own vicinage are unfailing 
sources of delight ; who know the signs of the seasons and their myriad 
manipulations of animal and vegetable life, and who can describe 
what they see, not merely with scientific accuracy, but with poetic 
appreciation. . . . The dainty vignettes and marginal illustrations 
which decorate the fine broad pages are the work of Oliver Kemp, who 
is to be credited also with the fascinating cover design. . . . Mr. Brandt 
lias presented his neighbor's work in a form of which it is altogether 
worthy, and has made a book that will attract attention by its beauty. 
Times (Philadelphia), 



A SHORT HISTORY OF 

MONKS 

& MONASTERIES 

By ALFRED WESLEY WISHART, 

Sometime Fellow in Church History in The University of 
Chicago. With four photogravures, 8vo, hand-sewed, 
laid-antique pure cotton-fibre paper, broad margins, 
deckle edges, gilt top, 454 pages, fully indexed. Price, 
$3. 50 NET. 

PRESS NOTICES. 

Remarkably comprehensive and accurate, and, best of all, interest- 
ing. Home Journal (New York). 

Fascinating. News Tribune (Detroit). 

Splendid. Sunday Herald (Rochester). 

A narrative of absorbing interest. Argonaut (San Francisco). 

Will not fail to attract wide attention and interest. Mail and 
Empire (Toronto). 

When James Anthony Froude undertook to write the History of 
the Saints he encountered the same obstacles that Alfred Wesley 
Wishart met in writing his excellent work, "Monks and Monasteries." 
There were unlimited materials from which to draw, but without suf- 
ficient authenticity to justify the record to be made up from them. 
The late professor of history at Oxford gave up the task as a vain one, 
but Mr. Wishart has pursued his to a successful conclusion, and hav- 
ing winnowed the grain from its disproportionate quantity of chaff, 
presents us with a volume for which students and general readers 
must alike feel grateful. He has sifted his authorities so carefully 
that the book has the stamp of truth in every statement placed there, 
however so deftly, tint the literary grace of the work is fully and 
delightfully preserved. Scholarly without being pedantic, earnest 
and careful without showing either prejudice or partisanship, he 
sweeps the great field which his title includes, with a strength and 
evenness that give the book the hall-mark of sterling worth. His con- 
clusions are drawn upon no hypothetical grounds, and if modestly pre- 
sented do not lack the convincing qualities which Mr. Wishart so 
plainly sees and so effectively puts into view. Times (Philadelphia). 

A valuable contribution to the voluminous historical literature of 
the Catholic church. Picayune (New Orleans). 

It. emphatically ought to take rank among the favorite volumes in 
the libraries of students of the middle ages. North American 
(Philadelphia). 

The author has performed his gigantic task ably, . . . admirably, 
showing the true balance and the attractive impartiality of the true 
historian. Journal (Boston). 

Thoroughly interesting and thoroughly trustworthy. . . . We 
heartily commend the work.McAfn,itfr University MnrilMy (Toronto). 

A work of equal erudition and elegance. Tribune (Chicago). 

A captivating theme. ... A well-told tale. . . . Vivid and clear. 
. . . The writer is to be praised for the impartial spirit he exhibits. . . . 
The volume proclaims the student qualities of the author. His schol- 
arship is lighted up with a clear and discriminating literary style. 
Times (New York). 

Comprehensive and scholarly . . . direct and lucid. Express 
(Buffalo).

FROM THE PRESS OF 

THE ROBERT CLARKE COMPANY, Cincinnati, Ohio 



Recollections of a Lifetime 

By General ROELIFF BKINKEKHOFF. 1 vol., 8vo, 462 pages, 
cloth. $2.00. 

" General Brinkerhoff was the close friend of Stanton, Chase, and 
Blaine. He knew Lincoln, Grant, and Garfield intimately. He was a 
schoolmate aud lifelong friend of Roscoe Conkling. But it is his 
record of events prior to the war when he was still a young man in his 
'teens, that General Brinkerhoff is even more interesting than in his 
story of the more bustling events in which he always took a more or 
less active part. The glimpses he gives of the old antebellum days in 
the South and into the old plantation homes in the slaveholding times, 
bring vividly before the reader that old semi-patriarchal southern 
civilization which now is all but forgotten." Sun (New York). 

Selected Writings of Isaac M. Wise 

With a Biography by the joint Editors of the book, Rabbi 
DAVID PHILIPSON and Rabbi Louis GROSSMANN, D.D. 
Crown 8vo, cloth, $1.50. 

During the fifty years of his literary activity, Dr. Wise wrote upon 
well-nigh every subject of interest in the development of Jewish life 
and thought in America. In making their selections from the great 
mass of material at their disposal the editors have been guided by the 
purpose of choosing such writings as shall exhibit the rounded career 
of the leader who has stood at the front of American Jewish life for 
half a century. 

My Mysterious Clients. 

By HARVEY SCRIBNER, of the Toledo (Ohio) Bar. 1 vol., 

12rao, cloth, illustrated. $1.25. 

"The author has drawn upon his legal experience and observation for 
the material of his stories. The cases are all striking in their charac- 
ter, or in their denouement, and the reader, whether lawyer or layman, 
is certain to feel a strong interest as to the outcome of each. " Plain 
Dealer (Cleveland). 

"The sketches are unique in modern fiction, as they deal with inner 
views of the lawyer's profession. It is a field hitherto unworked, and 
the author has demonstrated that it is an attractive one." Time* 
(Toledo). 



That Kentucky Campaign; 

Or, THE LAW, THE BALLOT, AND THE PEOPLE IN THE 
GOEBEL-TAYLOR CONTEST. By HUGHES, SCHAEFER, and 
WILLIAMS. 8vo, 100 illustrations. $1.75. 
The book does not offer to solve the questions brought out in the 
political campaign in Kentucky. It is a simple narrative, in direct 
language, relating the evolution of the strife, of the culminations that 
attended it, and of the harsh discord that rang out from the historic 
yet romantic atmosphere of "the dark and bloody ground." 

Shaksper Not Shakespeare 

By WILLIAM H. EDWARDS, author of " Voyage on the River 
Amazon," "The Butterflies of North America," etc. 
12mo, cloth. $2.00. 

Shaksper not Shakespeare, that is, that William Shaksper was not 
the writer of the Shakespeare poems and plays. Not only does Mr. 
Edwards hold that Shaksper was unequal to the composition of any 
one of the poems or plays, but he denies that he ever acquired the 
manual art of writing, even to the extent of signing his own name. 

"He revels in old documents and contemporary records. He accu- 
mulates such a formidable array of facts, literary, biographical, and 
historical, that it seems to need a giant to hurl the pile to the ground. 
. . . The time has gone by when a mere shrug of the shoulders or the 
utterance of the word ' Nonsense ' can be regarded as sufficient to 
overthrow the immense pile which the anti-Shakespeareans have so 
carefully and patiently constructed. " Gazette (Birgmingham, Eng.). 

Moorehead's Prehistoric Implements 

A Reference Book of all the Weapons, Ornaments, Utensils, 
etc., of Ancient Man in the United States. Illustrated, 
8vo, cloth. $3.00. 

This volume of over 400 pages contains 500 figures illustrating some 
3,000 different stone, shell, clay, bone, copper, and flint relics of all 
known forms and types. It is an illustrated catalogue and is published 
as an aid to students and collectors in classifying and naming exhibits 
or individual specimens.

The NEW CENTURY LIBRARY is a radical departure in the art of bookmaking. The 
largest novel is published unabridged in a single volume, which is so small that it is equally suitable 
for the pocket or satchel. As a library edition it is handsome in the extreme. The size is only 
4^ x6^ inches, and not thicker than a monthly magazine. The type used is as large and as 
easily read as that you are now reading. The India paper, on which these works are printed, is 
the same as used in the famous Nelson's Teachers' Bibles. 

In workmanship and quality this edition cannot be surpassed. It is made to last a century. 
Taken altogether, this is the most desirable and convenient form in which these works have ever 
been issued. Each novel can be had handsomely bound in the following styles : 
Cloth, extra, gilt top, $1.00. Leather Limp, gilt top, $1.25. Leather Boards, gilt edges, $1.50. 

Sent postpaid on receipt of price. Money refunded if not satisfactory. 

Scott's Novels complete in 25 volumes will follow immediately.

DR. DALE. A Novel. 



By MARION HARLAND and ALBERT PAYSON TERHUNE (mother and son). 
I2mo, cloth, $150. 

The scene of this remarkable story is laid in the Oil Lands of Western Pennsylvania, a 
region until now strangely overlooked by American novelists. The public, a-weary of 
novels which enfold problems as sugar plums encase pills, will enjoy a powerful, vivid, 
realistic story that deals with no abstruse enigma beyond the old sad puzzle of love, labor, 
sin, and suffering. The movement quietly sustained in the earlier chapters rises artistically 
to a thrilling climax as the tale goes on. Marion Harland has never done a better piece of 
work, and the strong hand and lively imagination of her collaborator infuse virile power into 
certain passages and chapters. As the first instance in the history of literature in which 
mother and son have written a book in partnership, " Dr. Dale " is worthy of note.

A New England story of present-day life, in which

is oppressed with care. The elegant villain, who is

N. Y. Times (April 7): A well-illustrated book is always a 
delight. 

The Bookman : A book to be read and hugely enjoyed. 

Mail and Express : Mr. Hayes' book is essentially a novel of 
adventure by land and sea, and a good one. 

The Daily Telegraph : The book possesses merit of the very 
highest order. 

Newark Daily Advertiser : It is the best book we have seen 
in respect to cover, contents, and cuts. 

Burlington Free Press : Combines with a powerful love story 
to make the reader unwilling to stop reading till the last page has been 
reached. 

Minneapolis Times : Well worth reading. 

The Liverpool Mercury : Not a dull page in the book. 

The World : This fascinating romance. 

Pall Mall Gazette: Throughout, the dialogue is noticeably 
clever. 

Ladies' Pictorial: As fascinating in its way as Dumas' "Three 
Musketeers." 

The Dial, Chicago : Mr. Hayes is a new writer to us, but he 
deserves well of the novel-reading public. French and Spanish politi- 
cal intrigue, as well as English, make up a large part of the historical 
substance of this highly exciting narrative. 

Anna Katharine Green: "A Kent Squire" is worthy of any 
favor it may receive. The author strikes me as being a remarkable 
man.

A Weekly Magazine of Contemporary Literature and Thought. 
A Necessity to Every Reader of Intelligence and Literary Taste. 

EACH WEEKLY NUMBER CONTAINS SIXTY-FOUR PAGES, 

In which are given, without abridgement, the most interesting and important contributions to the 
periodicals of Great Britain and the Continent, from the weighty articles in the quarterlies to the light 
literary and social essays of the weekly literary and political journals. Science, Politics, Biography, 
Art, Travel, Public Affairs, Literary Criticism, and all other departments of knowledge and 
discussion which interest intelligent readers, are represented in its pages. 

"THE SIEGE OF THE LEGATIONS." 

THE LIVING AGE will begin, in its issue for November 17, and will continue for several successive numbers, a 
thrilling account of "The Siege of the Legations," written by Dr. Morrison, the well-known correspondent of the 
London Times, at Peking. This narrative is of absorbing interest in its descriptions of the daily life of the besieged 
legationers, and it is noteworthy also as containing some disclosures relating to the inside history of what went on at 
Peking in those stirring days, which are altogether new and of the utmost importance. The unusual length of Dr. 
Morrison's narrative has precluded and probably will preclude any other publication of it on this side of the Atlantic. 
In England it has attracted wide notice.

effectively states and explains the great questions of the day, gives the timely news of the 
important events of the month, and summarizes the most notable articles of the other magazines 
of the world. 

THE CENTURY MAGAZINE 

The Century is known all over the world, and Americans do not need to be told of its 
excellence as an illustrated magazine of fiction, art, poetry, and miscellany. As such, it makes 
a remarkably felicitous combination with THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS, occupied as the latter 
is with the public questions of the day. The regular price of The Century is $4.00 per year. 

THE CENTURY ATLAS 

The person who appreciates the endless value a really good atlas has for man, woman, 
and child in the home naturally wants the best, the standard work, accurate to the last degree, 
with all the resources of the geographer, the map-maker, the statistician, and the historio- 
grapher lavished upon it. Such an institution as the Century Atlas of the World helps to set the 
intellectual standards of any household ; it is simply invaluable to a man in business, professional, 
or public life. 

The Century Atlas of the World is an entirely new work, designed to exhibit not only the 
latest geographical knowledge, but also political changes. It is, in fact, the first really comprehensive 
up-to-date atlas of the whole world ; for similar European works have neglected the United States, and 
American works have been generally unsatisfactory in their treatment of Europe and the Far East. The 
Century Atlas alone gives the results of the latest explorations, and such recent political changes as the 
annexation of Hawaii, the results of our war with Spain, and the limits of the Greater New York. 

People of taste regard a really excellent map as a work of art. The Century Atlas, prepared under the 
same editorial management as the great Century Dictionary, has none except models in this sort of map- 
making, in scheme and in mechanical execution. There are over three hundred up-to-date maps, the foreign 
names of the maps being translated. The Atlas is an imposing and sumptuous volume, the size 10 x 13 
inches ; every mechanical detail is as nearly perfect as the best modern printer's art can make it. The volume 
we offer is very handsomely bound in half morocco. The regular price is $i 7. 50. More detailed information 
concerning this magnificent product of The Century Co. 'will be given on application.

GOOD CHEER 

A Monthly Magazine for Cheerful Thinkers 
Edited by NIXON WATERMAN. 

A New Magazine of Pleasure-Giving Heading, 

wholly cheerful and such as only Nixon 

Waterman can offer. 



Each number will contain some contribution from 
Mr. Waterman's felicitous pen, to include occasional 
aphorisms in the original style of his "Home-Made 
Heterodoxy," and frequent verses of the kind 
which have placed him among the leading American 
humorists. 

The magazine is not to be the exponent of any par- 
ticular creed or party, but will commend the good, 
wholesome, and praiseworthy, wherever found. The 
typography is neat and artistic, without any attempt to 
be unconventional. 

Subscription price, one dollar a year ; ten cents a 
copy. The first and second numbers are ready, and 
will be mailed on receipt of ten cents each.

" Let DIARIES be Brought into Use" 

SAID THE WISE LORD BACON 300 YEARS AGO. 

The regular systematic use of a Diary economizes time, 
teaches method, and in the use of its Cash Account saves 
money. Even the briefest notes made in a Diary are easily 
referred to, and give a reliable and chronological history of 
one's acts, while if entered in a memorandum book they are 
soon lost.

most remarkable features of the book is the reproductions of selected rugs by a new color process. The 
subjects have been chosen as typical ones best suited to illustrate the text, from the collections of W. C. 
Whitney, J. W. Ellsworth, Mr. Erdman, and other well-known private collections. The owners have in all 
instances been delighted with the success of the reproductions.

Illustrated with 75 photogravures from original negatives. 

Three volumes, crown 8vo, cloth, full gilt, gilt top, with cloth jackets and in a cloth box. 

List price, $7.50. 

"This Is My Own My Native Land." 

"AMERICA: PICTURESQUE AND DESCRIPTIVE " presents in an interest- 
ing form such a knowledge as the busy reader would be pleased to have in one comprehensive 
view of the history, geography, picturesque attractions, productions, peculiarities, and salient 
features of this great country, not only as a work of reference and a sumptuous work of art, 
but as a book of very readable interest as well. 

The NEW YORK HERALD, in an advance review says: 

" tAn interesting and valuable work. . . . Mr. Cook has an eye for the 
large things tbat are permanent, and the small things that are momentarily 
even more interesting. He tells a story well. He describes a scene vividly. 
He is an excellent cicerone." 

" M. W. H." (MayO W. Hazeltine, the eminent literary critic), in the 
course of a four-column advance review of this work in the New York Sun of Oct. 7, says : 

"The usefulness of such a book will be generally appreciated. It is impos- 
sible for an American citizen to know too much of his own country, and every 
work that helps to increase his knowledge thereof ought to be welcomed as a 
valuable addition to current literature." 



By JOHN FULTON, D.D. 

Crown 8vo, cloth, gilt, with 30 full-page photogravures and a map. List price, $3.00. 

In our regular PHOTOGRAVURE SERIES, uniform with Cook's "America," 
" England," etc. It will fill a want that has long existed for a readable and compact, as 
well as comprehensive, volume upon the Holy Land. Dr. Fulton's reputation as a Biblical 
scholar ensures the value of the book, and his terse and attractive writing makes a very 
readable book. It will take rank as a standard work, descriptive of Palestine, and will give the 
general reader in most interesting form all that he needs to know upon this important subject.

THE WEIRD ORIENT 

By HENRY ILIOWIZI, author of "/ the Pale" 

Illustrated by a photogravure and half-tones 

from drawings by W. Sherman Potts (Paris). 

I2mo, cloth, gilt top ; list price, $1.50. 

The Doom of Al Zameri SheddacTs Palace of 
Irem The Mystery of the Damavant The Gods 
in Exile King Solomon and Ashmodai The 
Fate of Arzemia The Student of Timbuctu The 
Croesus of Yemen A Night by the Dead Sea. 

RICHARD HENRY STODDAR-D says : " Readers are 
not likely to require any guarantee of their authenticity, 
which is unmistakable, they reveal such knowledge of 
early Jewish and Moslem traditions and superstitions." 

"An almost untouched and virgin field is entered 
by the author of 'The Weird Orient.' The weird 
tales of the Orient have always fascinated the Occi- 
dental. . . . Mr. Iliowizi has performed a notable 
work . . . these weird tales make up a very fasci- 
nating book. Every one of the nine tales teems with 
a psychological interest as well as affording entertain- 
ment as a story. ... So to this wandering Parsee, 
scattering jewels as he went, as well as to Mr. 
Iliowizi, are the readers of this delightful volume 
indebted for glimpses into a wonderland full of mys- 
tery and irradiated by glints and gleams of the light 
that never was on sea or land." Herald (N. Y.). 

' ' An exceedingly brilliant book. ' * Picayune 
(New Orleans). " Interesting, poetical, and fasci- 
nating." G/ofo (Boston). " The book is well illus- 
trated. The legends are in themselves of unusual 
interest, and are set in beautiful language." Even- 
ing Telegraph (Philadelphia). 

IN THE PALE. By HENRY ILIOWIZI, 

author of " The Weird Orient" Illustrated, 

I2mo, cloth; list price, $1.25. 

These are legends and stories current in what is 
officially known as " The Pale of Jewish Settlement 
in Russia," and as folk-lore are perhaps unique.

Czar in Rothchild's Castle The Legend of the Ten 
Lost Tribes -The Legend of the B'nai Mosheh 
An Apple of Eden. 

"There has been an exuberant literature of the 
modern Jewish people. In Europe it embraces a host 
of works of fiction (Aguilar, D' Israeli, Heine, Kom- 
pert, Zangwill), which have been reinforced by simi- 
lar works of Eugene Sue, George Eliot, and other 
writers outside the Jewish pale. Henry Iliowizi is 
not the inferior of any who have entered this field."

some few instances as with Ex-President Cleveland, 
who personally wrote what he wished included ; or 
the Rev. Dr. Storrs, who before his death, selected 
what he wished to represent him the selections 
have been made by the writers themselves. 

From JOSIAH STRONG, D.D., LL.D., author of 
"Our Country," etc.: " My Dear Dr. Kilbourn

forming, and quickening not only of value to 
ministers, but of interest to the general public. Yours 
faithfully, JOSIAH STRONG."

Haven). " Cannot but prove of value as well as

OF THE TALMUD 

By MADISON C. PETERS, author of " Justice to the 
Jew," etc., with an introduction by H. PEREIRA 
MENDES. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

The great bulk of the Talmud discourages the gen- 
eral reader from approaching it, and translations of 
portions of it are rare. It is a rich repository, however, 
of wise, pithy, and witty sayings in passages from a 
single line to a page or more in length. Dr. Peters's 
compilation places hundreds of these within the reach 
of English-speaking people, and forms an attractive 
reference book of apt and striking quotations from a 
hitherto somewhat inaccessible source. 



RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS 

FOR SOCIAL BETTERMENT 

By JOSIAH STRONG, President League for Social Ser- 
vice. 12mo, cloth, 50 cents. 

This work was prepared as a special contribution to 
the United States Exhibit of Social Economy at the 
Paris Exposition, where it was awarded a gold medal. 
"These new activities are shown to differ from the old in 
their effort to uplift the whole of the man instead of a frac- 
tion of him, and to regenerate society as well as individuals." 
Outlook.

TWO GREAT NOVELS 



Fourth Edition. 



By ELMORE ELLIOTT PEAKE 

From its close relationship to the life and destiny of the people of 
everyday affairs, The Darlitlgtons has a certain kind of interest that 
is lacking in other fiction. It is typically American only American 
conditions could have produced it representing as it does the life of 
American industry and American enterprise. There is in it, too, the 
lightening touch of a well-defined love element. 

" A remarkable piece of work." New York Telegram, 

" Mr. Peake has brought out a very characteristic American type which has never be- 
fore had adequate treatment. The Dartingtons might stand for thousands of flourishing 
families which represent the newer aristocracy of small towns in all parts of the country." 
Springfield Republican. 

Cloth, 12mo. $1.50. 



In its 36th Thousand 



By BOOTH TARKINGTON 

"Monsieur Beaucaire" is a historical romance historical only so 
far as its setting agrees absolutely with the custom and spirit of its time. 
It is a cavalier tale of Bath in the days when Lady Mary Carlisle was 
the most beautiful woman in England. Beaucaire was one of her 
lovers, and in the finding out whether he was loved as a man or as a 
gentleman of rank, he had many thrilling adventures. 

"Monsieur Beaucaire was a clever and cool and interesting gentleman, as everybody 
may see who will be so sensible and so wise as to read the story." Harper's Weekly. 

" Love making, brilliant sword play, witty and unforced dialogue, and a series of climaxes 
that are admirably dramatic." New York Sun.

historical accuracy.

THREE CENTURIES OF AMERICAN 
LITERATURE. 



A few weeks ago we discussed, in the light 
of Mr. Stedman's " American Anthology," the 
single century of literary activity that has pro- 
duced practically all of the poetry that we 
cherish as our American national possession. 
It is to the larger subject of our entire liter- 
ature, now that three full centuries of its 
course have been rounded, that attention is 
directed by the present discussion, for which 
occasion has been furnished by the appearance 
of Professor Barrett Wendell's " Literary 
History of America." The plan of the series 
of literary histories for which this work has 
been written, and of which it is much the 
most important volume thus far published, 
calls for far more than a collection of biog- 
raphies, bibliographical annals, and critical 
commentaries. It calls, indeed, for a history 
no less faithful to the service of Clio than the 
histories whose titles are modified by no qual- 
ifying adjective ; but it calls at the same time 
for a shifting of the point of view that will 
bring literature, rather than politics or stra- 
tegics, into the foreground. Such a treatment 
of English history has been attempted by the 
distinguished French scholar, M. Jnsserand ; 



486 



THE DIAL 



[Dee. 16, 



such a treatment of American history is now 
given us by Professor Wendell. It is only 
when discussed from this standpoint that 
American literature is given its full signifi- 
cance, for its absolute assthetic value is not 
great, relatively speaking, while no value 
could well be greater than that which it has 
for the interpretation of the national develop- 
ment, or for the appeal which it makes to the 
national consciousness. 

" The literary history of America," says the 
author, " is the story, under new conditions, of 
those ideals which a common language has 
compelled America, almost unawares, to share 
with England. Elusive though they be, ideals 
are the souls of the nations which cherish 
them, the living spirits which waken nation- 
ality into being, and which often preserve its 
memory long after its life has ebbed away. 
Denied by the impatience which will not seek 
them where they smoulder beneath the cinders 
of cant, derided by the near-sighted wisdom 
which is content with the world-old common- 
place of how practice must always swerve 
from precept, they mysteriously, resurgently 
persist." The possession of certain ideals in 
common with the island race from which we 
have sprung may be taken as the guiding 
principle of the writer's treatment of American 
literature. In assuming this basic proposition 
he plants himself upon solid ground, upon 
ground far more solid than that of the critic 
who is ever on the lookout for differentia in- 
stead of devoting his efforts to making clear 
the underlying unity of all the literature writ- 
ten in the English language. Nationality is 
far more a matter of language than of race or 
descent, and " these languages which we speak 
grow more deeply than anything else to be a 
part of our mental habit who use them." To 
take a single illustration of this principle, 
there was never uttered a philosophical truth 
more profound than that embodied in Words- 
worth's familiar lines, 

" We must be free or die, who speak the tongue 
That Shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold 
Which Milton held." 

That is the real secret of English democracy, 
and it also offers for the explanation of Ameri- 
can democracy a cause far more adequate than 
any superficial attempt to account for it as 
resulting from foreign influence. 

It is a part of the critic's business, no doubt, 
to detect differentia between the varieties of 
English expression in various lands, and they 
are not lacking between the literatures of 



England and America. Each country has its 
own landscapes, .its own trees and flowers and 
birds, its own historical traditions, and a civ- 
ilization moulded by its own form and pressure. 
But it is a mistake to exalt these minor diver- 
gences into generic distinctions, for they are 
much less than that, and serve chiefly to bring 
into clearer view the ideal community of the 
two bodies of literature, doing this by the very 
contrast between their unimportance and the 
importance of the deep spiritual traits upon 
which all these differences are the merest sur- 
face variations. We may possibly allow the ad- 
ditional drop of nervous fluid which Colonel 
Higginson claims for the American, but be- 
yond this we may hardly go and remain philo- 
sophical of mind. 

We have never seen a better statement than 
is now given us by Professor Wendell of the 
indissoluble unity of English and American 
literary expression. "The ideals which for 
three hundred years America and England 
have cherished, alike yet apart, are ideals of 
morality and of government, of right and of 
rights. Whoever has lived his conscious life 
in the terms of our language, so saturated with 
the temper and the phrases both of the English 
Bible and of English Law, has perforce learned 
that, however he may stray, he cannot escape 
the duty which bids us do right and maintain 
our rights. General as these phrases must 
seem, common at first glance to the serious 
moments of all men everywhere, they have, 
for us of English-speaking race, a meaning 
peculiarly our own. Though Englishmen have 
prated enough and to spare, and though Amer- 
icans have declaimed about human rights more 
nebulously still, the rights for which English- 
men and Americans alike have been eager to 
fight and to die, are no prismatic fancies 
gleaming through clouds of conflicting logic 
and metaphor ; they are that living body of 
customs and duties and privileges, which a 
process very like physical growth has made 
the vital condition of our national existence. 
Through immemorial experience, the rights 
which we most jealously cherish have proved 
themselves safely favourable at once to pros- 
perity and to righteousness." It is this two- 
fold idealism, of right and of rights, that has 
made English literature everywhere essentially 
the same, and a realization of this truth should 
rebuke the sectional pride which seeks to make 
barriers out of trifles, and find radical diverg- 
ences in the surface-play of expression. It is 
in this spirit that Professor Wendell has dealt

with the three completed centuries of American 
literature, not minimizing the individual pecu- 
liarities of writers or the special characteristics 
of groups, nor failing to recognize American- 
ism as a trait where it really exists, but keep- 
ing ever in mind the correlations of English 
and American history, and the fundamental 
unity of the two peoples as expressed in their 
institutions, their laws, their social and ethical 
outlook. 

The chief distinction to be drawn between 
English and American literature is concerned, 
not with any fundamental difference of tem- 
per, but a difference in the rate of develop- 
ment. No one can even glance over the selec- 
tions made for the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries in such a work as Duyckinck, or in 
the later " Library " of Mr. Stedman, without 
being impressed by the fact that the American 
literary manner was at all times a generation, 
if not a century, behind the English. This 
fact has many times been noted, but it has 
remained for the author of the work now 
under consideration to place due emphasis 
upon it, and to give it the prominence it de- 
mands in a survey of early American liter- 
ature. To begin with, he notes the fact that 
all of the famous first settlers of Plymouth 
and Massachusetts Bay Bradford, Win- 
throp, Cotton, Hooker, Richard Mather, Roger 
Williams, and the rest, were born Elizabeth- 
ans, although not " quite the kind of Eliza- 
bethans who expressed themselves in poetry." 
Now the characteristics of the Elizabethan 
spirit were these " spontaneity, enthusiasm, 
and versatility," and if we look aright we 
shall discover that such were also the charac- 
teristics of our own writers of the seventeenth 
and even the eighteenth centmry. Taking 
Cotton Mather as the typical man of letters 
of the two centuries in question, the writer 
boldly testifies to the vitality of his enthusi- 
asm, the spontaneity of his utterance, and his 
possession of " just that kind of restless 
versatility which characterized Elizabethan 
England and which even to our own day 
has remained characteristic of New England 
Yankees." The New England colonies re- 
mained practically uninfluenced by the social 
and political movements of the mother coun- 
try, and " in history and literature alike, the 
story of seventeenth-century America is a 
story of unique national inexperience." In 
the century following, came the preaching of 
Whitefield and the Great Awakening, and 
when the Revolution was ripe it " once more 



brought to the surface of American life the 
sort of natures whom the Great Awakening 
shows so fully to have preserved the spontane- 
ity and the enthusiasm of earlier days." The 
conclusion of all this argument is expressed 
by saying that " the Americans of the revolu- 
tionary period retained to an incalculable 
degree qualities which had faded from ances- 
tral England with the days of Queen Eliza- 
beth." 

This line of thought may be pursued down 
into the history of our literature during a con- 
siderable part of the century just ending, and 
it was not until we had a great national 
experience of our own that we produced a 
body of literature not closely associated with 
the earlier types of literature in our ancestral 
home. Up to the mid-century period when 
our literature first allied itself with a burning 
national issue, and became more distinctly 
American than it ever could have been before, 
there continued to be reversions to manners 
and forms of expression that were long out- 
worn in England. Space forbids us to continue 
the subject any farther, but enough has been 
said to show how fruitful a formula has been 
applied by Professor Wendell to the analysis 
of our literary past. It remains to add that he 
has produced incomparably the best history of 
American literature thus far written by any- 
body, a history that is searching in its method 
and profound in its judgments, on the one 
hand, and, on the other, singularly attractive 
in the manner of its presentation.

RECENT CHRISTMAS POETRY. 

( To the Editor of THE DJAL. ) 

In looking over our Christmas magazines of the past 
few years no easy task when taken systematically, 
but very good browsing for the frivolous one may 
notice our Christmas poetry as having a distinct share 
in the modern Romantic Revival. We are using, far 
more than formerly, the mysterious quality of the story, 
the mingling of the plain and the wonderful, the effective 
tone re-produced after a Pre-Raphaelite fashion 
of " archaic simplicity and Catholic fervor." We have 
ancient Christmas ballads and legends, made over for 
us and refined to exquisiteness, yet still suggesting their 
primitive and dramatic intentions; we have new carols 
in the old style; and, old or new, in their apprehension 
of The Mother and The Child, we have a reminder of 
the medieval painters. 

For example if one must choose take this: 
" The holly-berry's red as blood, 
And the holly bears a thorn, 
And the manger-bed is a Holy Rood 
Where Jesus Christ was born."

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



It is the beginning of a modern carol, in which the 
symbolism of the red blossom, the thorn, and the cross- 
shaped manger, suggest the decoration of some old 
missal. The mother, with prophetic vision, sees the 
form of the bed and shudders at it: 

" ' Jt minds me of a cross of wood ! ' 

Cried Mary, all forlorn." 

She covers the wood with hay, to hide the piercing 
symbol, but the cattle eat it away, and the cross is 
again bare to her sight. Here, as in Hunt's " Light 
of the World," or as in Rossetti's " Girlhood of Mary " 

I take these at random from a host of such pictures 

is that touch of deliberate intent which goes to make 
simplicity not simple; yet the general effect is one of 
mediaeval naloel'e and sincerity. 

We might choose again, and quote from a little poem 
of Miss Guiney's an imitation, perhaps, but so frank 
and sweet that we can put up with the antique 
spelling: 

" The Ox, he openeth wide the Doore, 
And from the Snowe he culls her inne, 
And he hath seen her Smile therefore, 
Our Ladye without sinne." 

Another too lovely to be resisted is an adaptation 
from the Provencal, telling of a widowed mother, very 
poor, and with no gift for the Holy Child save her own 
child's cradle and pillow. She would carry Him these, 
but feels that it may be wrong to rob her own. Then 
" Oh miracle ! The nursing babe, 

The babe, e 'en as he fed, 
Smiled in his tender mother's face. 

And, * Go, go quick ! ' he said, 
4 To Jesus, to my Saviour, take 

My kisses and my bed.' " 

The child so the legend goes became, in manhood, 
one of the Twelve, and the poem relates it with a sim- 
plicity which amounts to quaintness, expressing per- 
fectly the mediaeval and romantic spirit of acceptance 
and unquestioning wonder. 

Among others, of a more moderate note, I remember 
Miss Sill's " Ere Christ, the Flower of Virtue, Bloomed," 
a poem at once narrative and extremely pictorial; a 
little " Revelation," which shows the child of the Inn 
as dreaming of the child Christ out in the cold 
4 ' With never a rest for his little white feet, 

Nor a place for his weary head," 

and, again, a beautiful " Annunciation," a poem by 
Mrs. Spofford, in which a Hebrew chant is repeated, 
like a thread of rich and solemn colors in some mys- 
tical, heaven-white garment. 

One contrasts such poems with those that preceded 
them things not picturesque, not especially emotional, 
not any with any recalling of mediseval art, but of a 
thoughtful character and dwelling upon the inmost 
spirit of the time. An older poem, which I think is 
Whittier's, tells of a certain monk who cared but little 
for the Christmas festivities of his convent. It closes: 
4 ' With mask and mime 
And wake-song speed the holy time, 
But judge not him who, every morn. 
Feels in his heart the Lord Christ born." 
For many years our Christmas poetry was apt to be of 
this type, and there is much of it which still concerns 
itself with the last and loveliest meaning of the season; 
but just now in the respect of art, if not in the respect 
of quantity the other type prevails. That it is beau- 
tiful, that it appeals to the tenderest of imagination, 
that it shows, most exquisitely, the poetic qualities of 
the Christmas story, is too plain for statement; but 



with all this, we must turn often to the other type, the 
soberer type, which breathes interpretation, and which 
gives encouragement for the burden of the long year's 
living. MARGARET STEELE ANDERSON.

SHAKESPEARE AS A DUTY. 

( To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

For something like a century, more or less, the 
sneer of the blunt Steevens at the Sonnets of Shake- 
speare has been regarded with amazement, pitying or 
indignant, according to the temper of the reader. It has 
been reserved for a contributor in your issue of Nov. 
16 to outdo Steevens by the stark assertion that, 
while " we " read a modern novelist with delight, 
Shakespeare " we " read " out of a sense of duty." 
This incentive is undoubtedly more powerful, in some 
respects and with some people, than "the strongest 
act of Parliament ever framed," those, I think, were 
about the words of Steevens. We are taught that 
"Morality is three-fourths of life," and that Duty has 
a freshening influence upon "the most ancient heavens." 
Yet even the critic who made that arithmetical state- 
ment about Morality, in a more inspired moment 
admits "that severe, that earnest air" to be something 
more than natural. This contrast between Morality 
and Nature had encouraged some of us to feel that the 
robin still sang, and the brook still ran down the lea, 
as they did when we were boys; and that boys and 
men still read Shakespeare without asking why. We 
vividly recall the time when to read him brought us 
in danger of the birch. The suggestion that in Mars 
or Hesper boys and men were birched for not reading 
Shakespeare would have made us 
"Yearn, and clasp the hands, and murmur, 'Would to God 

that we were there.' " 

With the passage of the " years that bring the philo- 
sophic mind," we had come to recognize the existence 
in this world of many strange things that one does not 
like to think of, among the rest, that there may be 
people who read Shakespeare only " on terms of base 
compulsion." By the way, who are these other slaves 
of duty whom Mr. Stanley classes with himself as 
"we"? If Steevens were still alive, but no, the 
suggestion would be unworthy: of the dead we must 
speak only good. It is better to consider the plaintive 
"we" as used to veil the writer's personal infirmity. 
"To be a well-favored man is the gift of Fortune, but 
to read and write comes by Nature." As no motive 
short of the most exalted is sufficient to induce him to 
read good literature, it is idle to enquire upon what 
tremendous incentive he charges into the field of lit- 
erary criticism. 

A friend of mine who knew English literature, and 
had read both Shakespeare and Scott through, twenty 
times and more, wrote at an advanced age: "I am 
re-reading the whole of Shakespeare this summer for 
variety and novelty." It was of her, now gone where 
Shakespeare is, that I was thinking, as well as of others 
still in the flesh, when I permitted myself to borrow 
Mr. Stanley's plural pronoun. Some of us read Balzac 
too, or did before it became a cult, and, therefore, 
of course, a duty. In fact, with Taine, we like pretty 
much " everything that is literature," and we wish that 
people would not contrive to make it a bore.

A CRITIC CRITICIZED. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In " Scribner's Magazine," some months ago, there 
appeared a criticism of Balzac by Professor George 
McLean Harper. According to this critic only the 
following of Balzac's novels and stories are "indubita- 
ble, illustrious successes": 



Novels. 
' Enge'nie Grandet." 
'Ce'sar Birotteau." 
' Le Curg He Tours." 
' Le Pere Goriot." 
' La Femme de Trente Ans." 
'Uu De'but dans la Vie." 
4 La Rabonilleiifle." 
' Le Colonel Chabert." 
4 L' Envers de 1' Histoire 
Contemporaine." 



Short Stories. 
4 J6sus-Christ en Flandre.' 
'Un Episode sous la Ter- 

reur." 

1 LeChef-d'CEuvre Inconnu." 
'El Verdugo." 
1 La Messe de 1' Ath5e." 
1 L' Auberge Rouge." 
' Le Re"quisitionnaire." 
VUn Drame au Bord de la 

Mer." 

" No other French writer," says Mr. Harper, " per- 
haps 110 two or three of them together, can offer so 
long a list of splendid novels. It contains more vigor- 
ous intellectual substance than all the rest of French 
fiction put together. In these pages live two or three 
score men and women endowed with distinct individu- 
ality and at the same time standing as types of the 
race. A sense of awe overcomes us, as in the presence 
of an irresistible power, for through all these books 
quivers the mighty will of their creator, in painful 
effort, in exalted earnestness, compelling where it can- 
not charm." 

On the other hand, about one-half of Balzac's nov- 
els are, according to this critic, spoiled by " the mob of 
fashionable libertines, police spies, sentimentally de- 
bauched duchesses and countesses, rich and marvellously 
beautiful actresses and courtesans, of shady bankers, 
picturesque usurers, bohemian actors, idle and diaboli- 
cally clever journalists Rastignac, Maxime de Trailles, 
Lousteau, la Palfdrine, Lucien de Rubempie', Rouque- 
rolles, Marsay, du Tillet, FeMix de Vandenesse, Le'on de 
Lora.des Lnpeaulx.Nucingen, Magus, Gobseck, Nathan, 
Vautriu, Corentin, Peyrade, Florine, Florentine, 
Coralie, la Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, la Vicomtesse de 
Beauhdant, these, and a score of others like them, 
are as improbable as they are depressing, not to say 
degrading . . . they seem mere caricatures of reality. 
. . . Some of his novels must be accounted entire fail- 
ures because in them these figures whom he dotes on 
predominate." 

In criticising Bilzac it has seemed to the writer that 
certain difficulties are to be encountered, some of 
which Mr. Harper does not appear to have entirely 
overcome. What is to be understood by the broad 
terms " success " and " failure " as applied to a novel ? 
Conformity to every essential rule of realism, with at 
the same time opportunity given the reader to choose 
more refined, or more remarkable, or more lively com- 
pany than life generally offers to any one of us, is evi- 
dently Mr. Harper's idea of what a novel must possess 
in order to be an "indubitable, illustrious success." 
" We look to literature," he says " for something more 
interesting, nay, for something more elevated, than 
common events and common talk." Keeping this 
definition in mind, and applying it to the list of " splen- 
did novels " mentioned at the beginning of this com- 
munication, it is difficult to see what more refined, 
more remarkable, or more lively company " there is for 
the reader in " Enge'uie Grandet," " Ce'sar Birotteau," 
or Pere Goriot," for example, or what there is in 
them more elevated thau common events and common 



talk." To be sure we find in every one of these books 
a noble and unselfish character, but he invariably gets 
the worst of it, so that the three novels, though not 
degrading, are certainly depressing, and a successful 
novel, as we understand Mr. Harper to put it, should 
not be depressing. Again, it can hardly be said that in 
" Pere Goriot," for example, " the mob of fashionable 
libertines, police spies, etc.," play a subordinate part. 
If these people, " mere caricatures of reality, as improb- 
able as they are depressing, not to say degrading," 
were taken out of Pere Goriot," what would be left ? 
Nothing is more common than to criticise Balzac for 
the improbability of his characters, but to an experi- 
enced professional man practicing in a large city, 
almost nothing in his fiction seems improbable. " The 
mob of fashionable libertines, etc.," while perhaps de- 
pressing, are, in the writer's opinion, not so improbable 
as many well-accredited and accepted saints iu other 
fiction. The triumph of virtue with the concomitant 
downfall of vice sells well when pleasingly narrated, 
and is no doubt vastly consoling and elevating to the 
mind of the " average reader," but is it the truth and 
the whole truth about life ? And do books manufac- 
tured by this same old machinery really preach the 
sermon against injustice, tyranny, oppression, worldli- 
ness, and selfishness which masters like Thackeray and 
Balzac ring out from their pulpits? To the writer's 
mind, one principal reason why Balzac is great is be- 
cause he is not blind. He pays absolutely no attention 
to what the selfishly-contented like to think prevails, 
but gives us instead a candid and accurately related 
story dressed in the garb of entertaining fiction, of 
what some of us know to be the truth. Possibly it is 
not the most conspicuous truth in Thrums op in 
Cranford, but it is that which is all too evident to any 
observant professional man in Paris, in London, or in 
New York. 

Objection to some of Balzac's books is made by Mr. 
Harper on the ground that they are " profoundfy im- 
moral." Such an objection deserves serious considera- 
tion at a time when immoral plays and books are a 
source of rich profit to those who are debauching litera- 
ture and the stage. But according to Mr. Harper 
" Balzac is never easy reading," arid if this is the case 
do his books attract the sensual ? And if they do not 
attract the sensual can they really be called immoral ? 
Lastly, Mr. Harper thinks the addiction to money, so 
evident throughout Balzac's books, " a grave defect." 
" Money," he says, " with ignoble ways of earning, 
hoarding, and spending money, is the very substance of 
Balzac's books." But it must be admitted that money, 
with ignoble ways of earning, hoarding, and spending, 
is the very substance of life to an immense majority of 
the people of the world, and the care of money to all 
the rest. The social historian who would fail to make 
money the foundation on which his story of life is built 
resembles the anatomist who would exclude the skeleton 
from his treatise. 

Balzac was the priest to whom all humanity confessed. 
In spite of Mr. Harper's refined, cultivated, and appre- 
ciative criticism, I incline to the opinion that the critic 
of the great French novelist is not yet born. We are, 
of course, at liberty to express our opinion of his books, 
but always from a hopelessly individual point of view, 
and with the inevitable result that each one of us 
betrays to someone else his own comparative inexpe-

MB. HOWELLS'S MEMORIES.* 

Enjoyable is the inevitable word for Mr. 
Howells's new book, and we have no fault what- 
ever to find with it save that it lacks an Index, 
and that it leaves the reader, like Oliver Twist, 
asking for more. Candor is its key-note. Mr. 
Howells is charmingly frank about himself, 
and is frank, to a degree that would be disas- 
trous in a less sweet-tempered memoirist, about 
others. Therefore, as we read his book we 
are warmed with a sense of being taken to a 
flattering extent into his confidence. Most 
readers, we fancy, figure Mr. Howells mainly 
as a writer in fiction (if that be the word) of 
the " Silas Lapham " genre, and as the some- 
what impatient critic of writers in that other 
genre, who regard fiction as the natural and 
legitimate field for drawing the long bow ; and 
for such readers there are some little surprises 
in the present volume. For example, Mr. 
Howells opens his retrospect with the admis- 
sion that he began life as poet (by aspiration, 
at least), and that he tried to be, in those 
sanguine days, as much as possible like Heine 
that Romantique defroque. "Inwardly," 
he says, ' I was a poet, with no wish to be 
anything else, unless in a moment of care- 
less affluence I might so far forget myself as 
to be a novelist." Mr. Howells, moreover, 
began life a pronounced hero- worshipper the 
hero as man-of-letters being, of course, the 
divinity he most affected. Bayard Taylor, 
then lecturing in the West, was the first hero 
in that order that Mr. Howells met in the 
flesh, and the contact almost paralyzed him. 
" Heaven knows," he says, " how I got through 
the evening." At all events he sat through it 
rapt and speechless, watching the bard drink 
his beer and smoke his pipe, and hearing him 
discourse of quite sublunary things. " I 
longed," says Mr. Howells, " to tell him how 
much I liked his poems, which we used to get 
by heart in those days, and I longed (how 
much more I longed!) to have him know 
that 

' Auch ich war in Arkadien geboren ' " 

But he didn't dare to, and so Mr. Taylor left 
Columbus all unconscious of the homage of 
which he had been the object. We must add

Retrospect of American Authorship. By \V. D. Howells. 
Illustrated. New Yotk : Harper & Brothers. 



here parenthetically that the picture facing 
the account of the Taylor episode seems rather 
at variance with it, since it shows Mr. How- 
ells, not as a meek and reverent votary, but as 
a particularly alert and resolute looking re- 
porter, who, with pencil and note-book, is 
clearly applying the screws to Mr. Taylor in 
a way that causes him to mop his brow in 
agony. 

Mr. Howells had already printed poems in 
the "Atlantic Monthly " and in the " Saturday 
Press," of New York, when he started for 
Boston, then in its Augustan age, to see the 
real Olympians Lowell, Hawthorne, Holmes, 
Emerson, and the rest, and for New York 
to see, as he fondly fancied, the real bohemians 
now no matter whom. Bohemia (or Boaotia, 
as the Olympians thought) was then poking 
its beer-cellar fun at the Athens to the north 
of it, and Mr. Howells expected profit and 
pleasure from studying the contrasts. One of 
the first of the New England literati upon 
whom he called was Lowell, and to him many 
cordial and delightful pages are devoted. Of 
all Mr. Howells's long and shining list of " lit- 
erary friends " it is Lowell, we fancy, who is 
to be rated his real dulce decus. He was then 
forty-one, or Mr. Howells's senior by nineteen 
years. 

" At the first encounter with people he always was 
apt to have a certain frosty shyness, a smiling cold, as 
from the long, high-sunned winters of his Puritan race; 
he was not quite himself till he had made you aware of 
his quality: then no one could be sweeter, tenderer, 
warmer than he; then he made you free of his whole 
heart; but you must be his captive before he could do 
that." 

Turning the page to a later reference to 
Lowell, near the end of the volume, we find 
some veiled or indirect allusion to the notion 
rife after his last return from England that 
his long stay abroad had made him " un-Amer- 
ican." Most of us remember the absurd way 
in which the press, or a certain section of it, 
assailed Lowell on this grave charge ; how his 
London clothes and London ways were made a 
reproach to him ; how it was said that he went 
about the country lecturing on Shakespeare 
when it was his patriotic duty to make political 
speeches ; how he was accused of trimming his 
opinions (and his whiskers) to the mode of 
what Mr. Guppy used to call " the swan-like 
aristocracy " and what not. Mr. Howells 
says that Lowell could never have been any- 
thing but American, if he had tried ; but, he 
adds, " he certainly did not return to the out- 
ward simplicities of his life as I first knew it."

" There was no more round-hat-and- sack-coat busi- 
ness for him; he wore a frock and a high hat, and 
whatever else was rather like London than Cambridge; 
I do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the 
effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now 
produced upon the witness. Some fastidiousnesses 
showed themselves in him, which were not so surpris- 
ing. He complained of the American lower-class man- 
ner; the conductor and cabman would be kind to you, 
but they would not be respectful, and he could not see 
the fun of this in the old way." 

Reverting to Mr. Howells's account of his 
first visit to New England, the eye is arrested 
by the following impressive portrait of 
Hawthorne, upon whom the author called with 
a generously worded letter of introduction 
from Lowell. 

"... He advanced carrying his head with a heavy 
forward droop, and with a pace for which I decided that 
the word would be pondering. It was the pace of a 
bulky man of fifty, and his head was that beautiful 
head we all know from the many pictures of it. But 
Hawthorne's look was different from that of any picture 
of him that I have seen. It was sombre and brooding, 
as the look of such a poet should have been; it was 
the look of a man who had dealt faithfully and there- 
fore sorrowfully with that problem of evil which for- 
ever attracted, forever evaded, Hawthorne. It was by 
no means troubled ; it was full of a dark repose." 

Mr. Howells's reception, though a thought 
*' shy and tentative," was nevertheless warm 
enough to be encouraging, and in the conver- 
sation that ensued he got on charmingly with 
his usually distant and elusive host. The talk 
turned on many men and things on Lowell, 
on Holmes, on German poetry, on the West 
(about which Hawthorne was curious, saying 
he wanted to see some part of the country on 
which the " damned shadow " of Europe had 
not fallen), on Emerson, on Thoreau, of whom 
he observed that he, Thoreau, " prided himself 
on coming nearer to the heart of a pine-tree 
than any other human being "; and Hawthorne 
was visibly pleased when his young visitor 
rejoined, " I would rather come near the heart 
of a man." Not ill pleased was he, Mr. 
Howells adds, " when he asked whether I was 
not going to see his next neighbor, Mr. Alcott, 
and I confessed that I had never heard of 
him." On parting, Mr. Howells received from 
his now friendly entertainer a note of intro- 
duction to Emerson, in the form of a card with 
the quaint endorsement : " I find this young 
man worthy." That was glory enough for 
one day. Next morning Mr. Howells hunted 
up or hunted down Thoreau. 

"... He came into the room a quaint, stump figure 
of a man, whose effect of long trunk and short limbs 
was heightened by his fashionless trousers being let 
down too low. He had a noble face, with tossed hair, 



a distraught eye, and a fine acquilinity of profile, which 
made me think at once of Don Quixote and Cervantes; 
but his nose failed to add that foot to his stature which 
Lamb says a nose of that shape will always give a man. 
He tried to place me geographically, after he had given 
me a chair not quite so far off as Ohio, though still 
across the whole room, for he sat against one wall, and 
I against the other; but apparently he failed to pull 
himself out of his revery by the effort, for he remained 
in a dreamy muse, which all my attempts to say some- 
thing fit about John Brown and Walden Pond seemed 
only to deepen upon him." 

Mr. Howells admits that his encounter with 
Thoreau was a rout ; and that with Emerson, 
it seems, was not much better. The talk with 
the latter appears to have been somewhat forced 
and indefinite ; but in the course of it, at any 
rate, the seraphic man found occasion to kindly 
dismiss Hawthorne's last book (the " Marble 
Faun ") as " mere mush," and to dispose of 
Poe as the " jingle man " ! Mr. Howells's con- 
tributions to the " Atlantic Monthly " Emerson 
had evidently not read, for, when they were 
mentioned, he got down a bound volume of the 
magazine, inspected the pieces with an air of 
seeing something very new indeed, and then 
gravely affixed the author's initials to each, 
with as much apparent emotion, we judge, as 
he might have shown in docketing a wash-bill. 
This ceremony ended, Emerson followed his 
leave-taking visitor to the door, still talking 
of poetry, to which (he added, as a parting 
crusher) " one might very well give a pleasant 
hour now and then." This finished Mr. How- 
ells for the day. " I went home to my hotel," 
he says, " and passed the afternoon in pure 
misery." He was at first at a loss to account 
for his seeming failure with Emerson, but at 
last hit upon the fact that, as he says, in his 
confused retreat from the philosopher's pres- 
ence, he had neglected some slight point of 
ceremony. On his return to Boston he related 
the story to Mr. Fields. 

" By this time I could see it in a humorous light, and 
I did not much mind his lying back in his chair and 
laughing and laughing, till I thought he would roll out 
of it. He perfectly conceived the situation, and got an 
amusement from it that I could get only through sym- 
pathy with him." 

From Boston Mr. Howells proceeded to New 
York to see Bohemia. He found it, we gather, 
to his disappointment, a great many shades 
less black, that is less naughty, than his eager 
fancy had painted it found it, in fact, a 
rather cheap and plainly sham Bohemia, as 
like the real Paris article as Tupper is like 
Verlaine, and peopled largely by young press- 
writers still in the Flegeljahre, who pretended

to live in sin and contempt of the Decalogue, 
and were, in their souls, as innocent as Mr. 
Toots. The whole thing, in short, was a pose 
like the sporting bent of Nathaniel Winkle. 
It was the custom of the " bohemians " to hold 
their (not very alarming) revels at Pfaff's, 
a beer-cellar up Broadway ; and there they 
paid mild, though ostentatious, court to Gam- 
brinus, railed at respectability and Boston, 
and were very fierce about all literary shams 
but their own. Let us turn to Mr. Howells 
for an account of an " orgy " at Pfaff's : 

" I felt that as a contributor (to the ' Saturday 
Press ') and at least a brevet bohemiari, I ought not to 
go home without visiting the famous place, and wit- 
nessing, if I could not share, the revels of my comrades. 
As I neither drank beer nor smoked, my part in the 
carousal was limited to a German pancake, which I 
found they had very good at Pfaff's, and to listening to 
the whirling words of my commensals, at the long 
board spread for the bohemians in a cavernous space 
under the pavement. ... At one moment of the orgy, 
which went but slowly for an orgy, we were joined by 
some belated bohemiaus whom the others made a great 
clamor over ; I was given to understand they were 
just recovered from a fearful debauch ; their locks 
were still damp from the wet towels used to restore 
them, and their eyes were very frenzied. I was pre- 
sented to these types, who neither said nor did any- 
thing worthy of their awful appearance, but dropped 
into seats at the table, and ate of the supper with an 
appetite that seemed poor. I stayed hoping vainly for 
worse things till eleven o'clock, and then I rose and 
took my leave of a literary condition that had dis- 
tinctly disappointed me." 

We have, in the foregoing extracts, barely 
scratched the surface of Mr. Howells's racy 
and pleasantly written book, which, be it said, 
will be prized not only as a rich repository of 
literary anecdote and portraiture, but for its 
autobiographical value, and, last but not least, 
for its vein of criticism. Mr. Howells's frank 
though loving appreciations of the work of his 
friends, Lowell, Longfellow, Holmes, Haw- 
thorne, Bayard Taylor, Mrs. Howe, Celia 
Thaxter, etc., form an element of much inter- 
est. Very pleasant reading indeed is the 
closing chapter on " Cambridge Neighbors," 
and right welcome to all true and thoughtful 
Americans should be its final tribute to one 
they delight to honor : 

" I am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are 
long forgot, and the noisy fames of the strenuous life 
shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before 
these of the gentle life, we shall all see in Charles 
Eliot Norton the eminent scholar who left the quiet of 
his books to become our chief citizen at the moment 
when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and 
disaster of doing wrong."

Two AMERICAN STUDENTS OF 

S II AKKSPK AK E.* 

When one recollects some of the fatuities 
that have been foisted upon the world in the 
name of Shakespearean criticism, one derives 
a certain solace from the lesson in practical 
philosophy taught by Scapin to his old master, 
Argante. Whenever, counsels Scapin, the 
father of a family is returning home, let him 
run over in his mind all the dreadful things 
that might have happened in his absence, " let 
him imagine his house in ashes, his money 
stolen, his wife dead, his son maimed, his 
daughter betrayed." Then he will be able to 
regard the non-occurrence of any one of these 
calamities as so much clear gain. Things have 
come to such a pass that there is but too good 
reason to look forward to a new book about 
Shakespeare with " horrible imaginings " 
almost equal to those with which the philo- 
sophical valet affects to comfort the perturbed 
old gentleman. So it is with a tremor of 
relief that the critical Argante notes first in 
Mr. Mabie's new book on William Shakespeare 
the things that are not done. To begin with, 
Mr. Mabie actually seems to think that " Mr. 
William Himself " is the divine Williams. To 
think otherwise would have been much more 
"original," and might have promoted the sale 
of his book. Mr. Mabie's chief originality as 
a biographer of Shakespeare lies in the fact 
that he does not try to invent or imagine any- 
thing new. The best compliment I can pay 
him is to apply to him the fine quotation he 
makes from Goethe : " To say a thing that 
everybody has said before as quietly as if 
nobody had ever said it, that is originality." 
His book has something of this quiet style, 
" the harvest of a quiet eye." It has the dignity 
of repose. Nor is this all : two positive quali- 
ties appear, sanity and catholicity. Sanity 
is shown in the author's choice of things to 
say, and quite as much in what he refrains 
from saying or suggesting. Catholicity is 
shown in his wide taste and in the largeness of 
his moral judgments. It would have been so 
easy for a writer having in view the audience 
to which, I believe, these chapters were first 
addressed, to " deplore " certain features of

the work of this world's poet. It might have 
been acceptable to many had Mr. Mabie 
apologized for Shakespeare because he wrote 
no hymns like those of Dr. Watts. But Mr. 
Mabie neither deplores nor apologizes. 

In sanity, and in what may be termed liter- 
ary integrity, Mr. Mabie presents a welcome 
contrast to Dr. Brandes, who is prone to put 
theory in the place of fact and to offer conjec- 
ture for proof. The American writer has, to 
be sure, a much smaller amount of material to 
deal with, the scope of his book being nar- 
rower. One can only say that, within the 
limits which he sets himself, he shows on the 
whole a surer command of his subject than did 
the Danish critic. 

All this is high praise : so high that some- 
one may enquire whether we have here at last 
a book about the world's greatest author which 
is worthy of the subject. Well, not quite! 
It is not, for instance, such a book as Dr. 
Brandes might have written had his great lit- 
erary energy and charm been supported by 
adequate scholarship and by sanity of judg- 
ment. For the task of writing anything like 
a decisive book, Mr. Mabie has given no sign 
of possessing the requisite force. A remark 
of Dr. Johnson about Addison may be applied, 
with more justice, to the author of the book 
before us : " He thinks justly, but he thinks 
faintly." Mr. Mabie pays the penalty of the 
habit of religious journalism. He writes too 
easily ; he slides with fatal facility into abstrac- 
tions. Precisely in those passages of large 
generalization where he should be especially 
definite and cogent, he becomes diffuse and 
vaporous. " Glittering generalities " are bad 
enough, but Mr. Mabie's do not even glitter. 
He exhibits at times a tendency to the pro- 
cessional style : grandiose generalizations at- 
tended by a pompous verbal retinue. He 
wrote, one fancies, having in view an audience 
that is fond of phrases "divinely relishing," 
an audience that would warmly applaud the 
obiter dictum of Mr. Justice Shallow : " Good 
phrases are surely, and ever were, very com- 
mendable." It is amusing to contrast this 
writer's long-tailed words with the simpler 
vocabulary of the author he treats of. Of 
course a writer of the present time cannot 
be expected to restrict himself to the vocabu- 
lary of any former period. Still, it is instruc- 
tive to note how freely and pregnantly our 
ancestors managed to discourse without the 
use of modernisms, such, for example, as " de- 
velopment," " environment," and a thousand 



others which too frequently do duty rather as 
counters than as the coin of thought. A 
favorite word with this writer is the word 
" spiritual." Thus he remarks that " the 
spiritual motive " of what he calls " the sonnet- 
sequence" is suggested in Sonnet 144. This 
statement, by the way, as Mr. Sidney Lee has 
decisively shown, is susceptible neither of 
proof nor of rational justification. But quite 
apart from that, one is puzzled to detect any- 
thing especially " spiritual " either in the "mo- 
tive " or the implications of this sonnet. Here 
and often the word in question is a manner- 
ism. Now Shakespeare uses the word only 
six times, and then rather as opposed to lay or 
temporal than in the sense which this writer 
commonly gives it. Perhaps this may be 
partly accounted for by Mr. Mabie's rather 
sweeping statement that " Into the region of 
pure spiritual impulse and ultimate spiritual 
relationship Shakespeare did not penetrate." 
To which it may be respectfully submitted 
that the region thus described, although laid 
down on no map, is one concerning which 
Shakespeare may possibly have reflected as 
much as some of those who talk more. He 
certainly is not of those who " prophesied in 
Thy Name ! " At all events, his example in 
saying little of subjects whereof he knew 
nothing is not a bad one for those writers 
who are so rich in sonorous phrases ingen- 
iously devised, like big bottles with small 
bellies, to dissimulate the paucity of their 
contents. 

The weakest chapter is perhaps the one de- 
voted to the sonnets. Plainly Mr. Mabie has 
never been possessed with a passion for these 
wondrous lyrics. He finds " a note of reality " 
distinctly sounded in what he assumes to be 
"the series." His argument based upon this 
" note of reality " is self- contradictory (p. 219). 
He forgets that the artist who endows his im- 
aginary creatures, Hamlet and Prospero, with 
such convincing reality, would have been quite 
equal to the creation, if creation it be, of such 
figures as the friend and " the woman colored 
ill." But I forbear further strictures. 

Shakespeare's literary executors, as one may 
venture to term Masters Heminge and Condell, 
prefaced the Folio edition of the plays with an 
address " To the great Variety of Readers." 
To this they added, with a prescience that to 
us seems wonderful, the words : " from the 
most able to him that can but spell." It is of 
course not for " the most able " that the book 
before us is written. For the other, larger

class, including possibly even some whose 
ability to spell is questionable, Mr. Mabie 
has provided a comprehensive, sober, and 
enlightening account of the life-work of the 
master-spirit of the English-speaking race. 
Such defects of manner and matter as I have 
referred to by no means vitiate the book. 
When the writer is content to tell a plain tale 
plainly he is attractive, sometimes charming. 
Had he succeeded in interpreting the magic of 
Shakespeare's art as he does that of the War- 
wickshire countryside, he would have produced 
not only a good but perhaps a great book. 
That descriptive chapter is as fine in its way 
as the exemplary treatment of the same subject 
by the late Mr. Spencer Baynes. On the 
whole, the book was worth writing, and may 
be said to merit the popularity which it is 
likely to enjoy. Some of the portraits are of 
contemporaries who stood in no known relation 
to Shakespeare, but many of the illustrations 
are extremely well chosen and are not easily 
accessible elsewhere. Particularly interesting 
are the reproductions of old pictures of Lon- 
don, of old London Bridge, of the Bankside, 
and the like. 

" I am not only witty myself," said Fallstaff, 
" but the cause that wit is in other men." 
Were Shakespeare condemned to read in Pur- 
gatory all the commentaries upon his works, it 
is to be doubted whether he would have the 
heart to repeat the boast of Fallstaff. Were 
he, however, sentenced to read only those com- 
ments that have been admitted into Dr. Fur- 
ness's Variorum edition of " Much Ado About 
Nothing," he might well regard the sentence 
as light. A recent correspondent of THE DIAL 
remarks, with gravity worthy of Dogberry, 
that " we " read Shakespeare " out of a sense 
of duty." The " glad hearts " who, as the poet 
of Duty concedes, may deem " joy its own 
security," cannot fail to be gratified, though 
perhaps a little surprised, to find that the 
sweetest of their stolen pleasures has so lofty 
a sanction. Some of us have from early youth, 
it appears, been doing our Duty unawares, as 
M. Jourdain talked prose. And it is in the 
same spirit that we others (if the gallicism 
may be pardoned) perform the duty of reading 
the notes culled and presented by Dr. Furness. 
Next to the text, nothing can be more amusing 
than the comment. Dr. Furness invites a 
goodly company to a wedding breakfast in 
honor of Benedick and Beatrice. Wit is there 
in the person of Christopher North ; Beauty in 



the person of Helen Faucet ; nor is the lady's 
endowment of wit the less liberal, any more 
than in the case of Beatrice herself. All the 
guests are at their best, and none speaks more 
delightfully than does the urbane master of the 
feast. 

Without going into details that would be 
out of place here, there is, in a general way, 
not much to be said of this monumental edition 
of "Much Ado " that has not been said of the 
preceding volumes of this priceless series. The 
set now comprises eleven plays (in twelve vol- 
umes), and constitutes, with respect to these 
plays, a Shakespeare library of the selectest 
quality. The present volume bears marks 
everywhere of the same amazing industry, un- 
assuming erudition, sure taste, and racy humor, 
that have distinguished the others. The editor's 
interpretation is both subtle and sympathetic; 
his humor is always good humor. It would be 
a liberal education to be snowed in with these 
volumes throughout " a Poland winter," nor 
would the time hang heavy. The best is that 
the editor so far overcomes his modest scruples 
as to give us more and more of himself. The 
charm of his personality seems to pervade the 
notes much as the magic of the master per- 
vades the text. Where no living scholar could 
equal Dr. Furness, he manages to improve 
upon himself. Whatever others may do, the 
publication of one of his volumes has come 
to be, whenever it occurs, the event of the 
year in this field. May the great editor be 
spared to double and treble the dozen he has 
completed! 

Every student of the poet should treat him- 
self to the luxury of the book at this Christmas- 
tide, and should begin his pleasure by reading 
that page of the Preface devoted to an enume- 
ration of the deeds imputed to the poet during 
the seven silent years concerning which there 
is no recorded syllable. I will forestall no 
one's delight (or duty !) by quoting anything 
but the concluding sally : " My own private 
conviction is that he mastered cuneiform ; 
visited America ; and remained quite a while 
here, greatly to his intellectual advantage." 
Here are two suggestions for doctoral theses. 
Nothing, I may add, is more creditable to Mr. 
Mabie than the judgment with which he has 
kept clear of these bogs, " where armies 
whole have sunk," upon the obscure shores of 
which Dr. Furness now places this bright 
danger-signal.

THE PAGEANTRY OF IJIFE.* 

With the advent of democracy the things of 
which Mr. Charles Whibley writes in " The 
Pageantry of Life " have become in a degree 
matters of commonplace. Splendor, courtesy, 
the artistic graces and refinements of life, have 
come nearer to man in the mass and have so 
lost some of their glamor but those to whom 
circumstance makes them increasingly access- 
ible are yet largely open to the charge of Phil- 
istinism ; they are still in a measure " insen- 
sible to the finer flavors of life." But this 
cannot be said of " Young Weston " or Bas- 
sompierre or Sir Kenelm Digby or Pepys or 
Saint Simon or Barbey d'Aurevilly, as Mr. 
Whibley insists in his brilliant portraits of 
them. They, and a number of others who are 
made familiar to us in these pages, are here 
given such vitality of life, with its glow and 
color, because of the author's enthusiasm for 
them as artists in life. 

But in such matters the point of view is of 
fundamental importance. Towards the suc- 
cessful consummation of what purposes should 
effort be directed that a life may be said at its 
close to have been artistically ordered? To 
the full enjoyment of all the finer flavors of 
life, our author would say, and we might accept 
this but that, in his interpretation, these finer 
flavors smack so much of the material as to 
verge upon grossness. Perhaps Lowell's charge 
that Pepys was a Philistine betrays some nar- 
rowness of sympathies. The Puritan strain 
kept Lowell, as it kept Emerson and Haw- 
thorne and their fellows, from appreciation of 
some of the finer flavors of life, no doubt. But 
on the other hand Lowell quite as certainly 
knew pleasures in life finer and higher than 
any that came to Pepys, and may not one be a 
Philistine through being insensible to the vul- 
garities of life, also ? 

" What then makes the artist, whose portrait is here 
attempted ? It is not profession, nor birth, nor man- 
ners, nor knowledge, nor success, though all these are 
invaluable accessories. It is temperament, it is life. 
The priest need not lag behind the courtier. Whoever 
had a finer sense of grandeur than Wolsey? and was 
not Pascal famous for his six horses ? Nor need pov- 
erty disturb a skilful exercise of the art. Burns had 
a glimpse into its possibilities when he sported the only 
tie wig in the parish, and the simple propriety of a 
graceful dinner is beyond the pocket of no man who 
can afford clean linen and a cheese. Again, the coat 
depends for its effect less upon the reckless use of vel- 
vet or satin than upon the bravery wherewith it is 
worn. But an inapposite assumption of birth, a clumsy 



* THE PAGEANTRY OF LIFE. By Charles Whibley. New 
York : Harper & Brothers. 



show of riches, are the worst foes of elegance: without 
the true temperament the resources of Golconda will 
avail nothing. When Byron said he would rather be 
Brummel than Napoleon, he did not merely pay a de- 
served tribute to the genius of dandyism; he acknow- 
ledged that the Dandy was distinguished by rarer qual- 
ities than those which achieve the conquest of the 
world. Yet Brummel could dazzle his rivals neither 
by exalted birth nor by lavish display. He was gifted 
with nothing save the sublime talent of his craft, and 
he triumphed." 

This is from the Introduction, and in a pre- 
ceding paragraph he has said of the artist in life: 
" It is no part of his design to be a good citizen. 
. . . He neither controls governments nor wins bat- 
tles. He despises the glory which follows a popular 
triumph, and he professes no greater interest iu the 
secrets of philosophy than is becoming to a person of 
wit. Nor is he a shining example of the homely vir- 
tues ; with him a sense of the picturesque is more 
vivid than the sense of morality." 

But the perfect artist is neglectful of no 
least detail in the setting of his picture. Back- 
ground and atmosphere are matters of first 
moment, and the central creation of the can- 
vas cannot be given form and color without 
regard to the harmony of the whole. In art 
there is no greater sin than that of putting 
together things that are discordant. 

Quite clearly an artist in life, as distinguished 
from a Philistine, is one in whom artistic sen- 
sitiveness is alive to all that can give pleasure 
of the higher sort, and alive no less to all 
that can offend a refined taste. Mr. Whibley 
does not see this quite clearly, and as a conse- 
quence throughout the volume the emphasis is 
often wrongly placed. Otherwise the book 
revives with delightful vividness some very 
interesting personalities. They are sketched 
with a grace and a sympathetic sureness of 
detail that make the portraits clearly outlined 
realities. And if, as in the case of the author 
of "Vathek," our interest in them is due to 
something unnatural and fantastic, it is, at 
least, not due to commonplace. Individuality, 
bravery, gaiety, and devotion to ideals are 
warm and vital on every page. We hear the 
clank of sword, the witty sally and the laugh 
that follows, the whisper of intrigue ; we see 
the life and movement and ceremony of courts, 
the smile and the obeisance of elegance and 
fashion ; and always in camp or court or con- 
vivial meeting we are shown a figure moving 
with graceful stateliness through the pageantry 
of life, and finding in it occasion for amuse- 
ment, for unfailing gaiety, for studious obser- 
vation, and at times for the artist's unfeigned 
and undisguised contempt.

RECENT FrcTioN.* 



The novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward are always 
characterized by an element of interest that lies far 
apart from the actual needs of fiction. With all 
her power of telling an interesting story, she is 
never content unless she interests us as well in some 
great theme of the intellectual life or of the historical 
social movement. In " Robert Elsmere" this theme 
was the solution of traditional religious beliefs by 
the medium of the higher criticism ; in " Marcella " 
it was the English socialist propaganda, in " Hel- 
beck of Bannisdale " it was the contrast between the 
ideals of Catholic and Protestant, and in "Eleanor" 
it is the struggle between conservative and radical 
forces in the life of modern Italy. An interest in 
Italy is in itself a passport to the favor of readers 
of refinement, and Mrs. Ward knows her Italy both 
without and within, knows it in its physical charm 
and its historical significance, knows it also in its 
political struggles and its clash of irreconcilable 
spiritual forces contending for the mastery. Her 
method, moreover, is one of such absolute fairness 
that it would be difficult from the book alone for a 
reader of " Eleanor " to be sure of the direction of 
the writer's personal sympathies. One could hardly 
get from the most partisan defender of the old 
regime a more vivid impression of Catholic Italy, 
of its pomp and pageantry, of its seductive appeal 
to the deeper emotions, of the great historical tra- 
dition which it embodies, than one can get from 
this book written by a woman who resolutely rejects 
the supernatural, and stands abreast of the most 
enlightened modern scholarship and philosophy.

Mrs- Ward has in a very rare degree the power of 
appealing to the religious sentiment without imply- 
ing the necessity for the acceptance of any form of 
religious dogma ; she makes us understand better 
than most writers how entirely religion, in its true 
sense, is an affair of the emotions rather than of the 
intellect. Beside these great issues, which are every- 
where at the front in her pages, the private interest 
attaching to her characters seems si ight. They are all 
skilfully studied, delineated with delicate touches, 
and brought into relations with one another that 
reveal the inmost springs of their life ; yet all this 
personal human interest, genuine as it is, seems 
overshadowed by the vaster interests of society 
which are kept before the mind. We take almost 
as much interest in the book about modern Italy 
upon which the hero is engaged as we take in the 
gradual awakening of his love for the heroine, or 
rather in the gradual transfer of his affections from 
one heroine to the other, since it would be difficult 
to say which of the two women concerned should 
be taken as the more important character in the 
development of the novel. Certainly, the book 
must be given a high place among our latest works 
of fiction, although in some respects it falls short of 
displaying the artistic power of "David Grieve" 
and " Robert Elsmere." We are inclined to say 
that it is with Mrs. Ward as it was with the only 
woman writer of fiction with whom she may be 
compared, to say, in short, that there is a decline of 
creative power in her works not unlike that exhib- 
ited in the transition from " Adam Bede " to 
" Daniel Deronda," and that this decline is not 
altogether compensated for by the richer display of 
intellectual force that is made in the later, and in 
many ways riper, productions. 

Mrs. Steel has once again shown her capacity to 
outdo Mr. Kipling as a delineator of modern India. 
for even Mr. Kipling's brilliant sketches of the 
great Empire of the East display no deeper insight, 
and have much less of solid workmanship, than 
such books as " On the Face of the Waters " and 
its worthy companion volume, " The Hosts of the 
Lord," just now published. Mrs. Steel's novels of 
India have one great fault, they are elliptical in 
construction, and it takes a considerable mental 
effort to understand how her characters are adjusted 
to their environment. Her own vision is clear 
enough, but she does not know how to impart it to 
others. But this fault is more than outweighed by 
the remarkable positive merits of her work. " The 
Hosts of the Lord " has a theme only less dramatic 
than that of the Great Mutiny, although it deals 
with a native uprising of restricted scope and of no 
far-reaching historical significance. But it has the 
same essential elements of interest, and its success 
in the portrayal of native types and modes of think- 
ing is complete. Of almost equal interest are the 
English men and women who figure in the narra- 
tive, and, with the one exception already noted, 
we have only praise for this remarkable piece of 
fiction.

" Robert Orange " shares the fate of most sequels 
in being less interesting than " The School for 
Saints." It has no Spanish war for dramatic effect ; 
it has no romantic dawn of love for sympathetic 
appeal. It offers, in the main, the working out of 
motives that wore off their freshness in the earlier 
volume, and it ends in a spiritual tragedy of renun- 
ciation. A few new people appear in its pages, and 
quicken the flagging interest to a certain extent ; 
but we do not greatly care for the series of readjust- 
ments in the loves of these characters with which 
the story is largely concerned, and the romance 
that has shaped itself between Orange and Madame 
Parflete is from the outset too evidently doomed to 
disruption. Yet the book has much charm the 
charm, at least, of distinction in its manner, and of 
the high-bred companionship with which it gratifies 
us. These interminable analyses of character are 
saved from becoming utterly wearisome by the deli- 
cate delineation and the subtle appreciation of mo- 
tive which they never fail to exhibit. The writer 
has lost none of her gift for phrase-making, and 
yet the penetration of her work by real ideas is as 
unquestionable as the amazing cleverness with 
which she shapes her points. Reactionary as her 
fundamental ideal may seem to us, it is both self- 
consistent and thoroughly sincere. 

Miss Silberrad's first novel, "The Enchanter," 
was a work of considerable promise, although 
marred by a vein of mysticism that gave the story 
an air of unreality. Her second novel, " The Lady 
of Dreams," errs, if anything, from an excess of 
realism, being in large measure a study of life in 
the slums of London. The central figure is a young 
girl of rare and elusive spiritual beauty, whose 
loveliness of character remains uninfluenced by her 
repulsive surroundings, and who suggests a water- 
lily blooming amid the foulness of a stagnant pool. 
She is wooed and won by a middle-aged physician 
whose character is, in its way, almost as lovable as 
hers, and the fate which finally overtakes the pair, 
killing the one and forever wrecking the happiness 
of the other, seems unnecessarily tragic. The work 
displays undeniable talent, but fails to make a last- 
ing impression on the imagination. 

Mr. Morley Roberts is an entertaining writer, 
with a talent for journalism rather than for liter- 
ature. His style has no graces, but has a good 
deal of animation, and makes its points in a rather 
telling fashion. His books always show the man 
of the world, who has knocked about a good deal, 
and who keeps close track of what is going on in 
the society and the politics of the present day. He 
has of late developed an aptitude for the roman h 
clef, and this description must be given to both of 
his new books. The characteristic is most marked 
in " Lord Linlithgow," whose titular hero might 
as well have been named Lord Rosebery outright, 
while the figure of Eustace Loder is Mr. Cecil 
Rhodes presented in as undisguised a shape as was 
the same figure in " The Colossus " of a year or so 
ago. The hero of the story is a rising young poli- 



tician of the Linlithgow following, and the plot 
turns upon a general election which is expected to 
bring the liberal imperialists into office. This elec- 
tion, again, turns upon certain documents of a 
nature compromising to the opposition, which it is 
essential should be brought to light. They are in 
the hands of an unscrupulous radical politician, 
who has no earthly right to retain them, but who 
refuses to give them up. The hero obtains a hold 
upon him by coming into possession of a secret 
which concerns his private character, and, with 
much reluctance, uses this knowledge to extort a 
restitution of the documents. This raises a pretty 
question of casuistry, and the novelist makes the 
most of it. When the decisive step has been 
taken, the hero is filled with remorse, determines 
to abandon public life, and succumbs to an attack 
of brain fever. The agony is piled up rather more 
thickly than seems strictly necessary, but the hero 
at last rallies from his illness, accepts the seat in 
Parliament which the election has brought him, 
and discovers that he has not forfeited the love of 
the remarkably ingenuous young woman who plays 
the part of the heroine. 

The other novel by Mr. Roberts is called " The 
Fugitives," and is a romance of the South African 
war. A young Englishman seeks to win the 
maiden whom he loves by starting out, at her be- 
hest, on a mission to the Transvaal, for the pur- 
pose of rescuing an officer, who is held prisoner at 
Pretoria. He equips himself with letters from 
the Mischief Maker at Brussels (who might as 
well have been named without ceremony), gets to 
Pretoria with some difficulty, arranges the escape, 
and gets off with his rescued friend. There is a 
good deal of adventure in this part of the narra- 
tive, and the effect is distinctly thrilling. As one 
of the first of what will doubtless prove a long 
series of South African war novels, " The Fugi- 
tives " sets a pace that may be regarded as satis- 
factory. 

"The Son of Carleycroft," by Mr. Theodore 
Burt Sayre, is a dashing and spirited romance of 
the time of Charles II. The historical interest is 
slight, but we become absorbed in the fortunes of 
the dare-devil hero and the coquettish heroine. It 
is a story of varied incident, exciting adventure, 
and wordy encounters of wit. If the wit is not 
exactly sparkling, it will serve, and the animation 
of the narrative is well sustained. 

Much the same comment may be made upon 
"The King's Deputy," by Mr. M. A. Hinkson, 
although here the historical interest is more 
marked. The scene is Dublin at the close of the 
eighteenth century, and the plot centres about the 
Irish conspiracies against the royal authority. 
Grattan figures among the characters, as well as 
our old friend Napper Tandy of the popular bal- 
lad. The story is a thin one, but not uninteresting. 

" Chloris of the Island," the latest romance by 
Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson, is a wild tale of love 
and villainy, of "free trading" and secret plot-

tings with the enemy, told of the southwest coast 
and of the time when a French invasion was an 
ever-living danger to England. The hero is almost 
as much of a swashbuckler as the desperate scoun- 
drel whose devices he sets himself to thwart, and 
the heroine is a hot-blooded and passionate crea- 
ture who proves his fit counterpart. The story has 
a strange fascination, and is pitched throughout at 
a high key of excitement. Heroics of all kinds 
are bestowed with a lavish hand upon the narra- 
tive, which has also a certain distinction of style, 
although its affectations of language are somewhat 
too pronounced to be altogether productive of a 
satisfactory effect. 

"The Footsteps of a Throne," by Mr. Max 
Femberton, repeats the success of the author's 
" Kronstadt," being a second romance of Russian 
life. The heroine is a beautiful woman of noble 
family, and her reckless escapades, combined with 
a passion for gambling, have brought her into dis- 
favor with the court. Confined by imperial order 
to her palace at Moscow, she is eating out her 
heart when a rescuer appears upon the scene in 
the person of an English nobleman, who falls in 
love with her, and, after many perils, including an 
expedition to the wilds of the Caucasus, carries her 
off to England as his wife. Mr. Pemberton's 
crisp and animated style, together with his ac- 
quaintance with the scenes and social conditions 
which he describes, gives to the book an interest 
that does not flag, and makes it an admirable 
example of artificial romance. 

" Venice, with her life and glory but a memory, 
is still the citta nobilissima a city of moods, 
all beautiful to the beauty-lover, all mystic to the 
dreamer ; between the wonderful blue of the water 
and the sky she floats like a mirage visionary 
unreal and under the spell of her fascination we 
are not critics, but lovers." These introductory 
words strike the keynote of Mrs. Lawrence Turn- 
bull's historical novel called " The Golden Book 
of Venice," and, as we turn its pages in sympa- 
thetic mood, we become " not critics, but lovers," 
so great is the charm of the work, so compelling 
its power to bring back to us half-forgotten mem- 
ories of the city of the lagoons, and revivify count- 
less past associations that had half-faded from the 
consciousness. Jne does not often come upon a 
book so interpenetrated with a passion for its sub- 
ject, a book at once so firmly based upon historical 
fact, and so intensely spiritualized in the alembic 
of the imagination. The central figure of Mrs. 
Turnbull's romance is that great scholar and theo- 
logian, Fra Paola Sarpi, and the story passes at 
the time when the proverbial saying, " We are 
Venetians first, Christians afterwards," had its 
origin. In other words, it is the time when Venice, 
proudly resisting the pretensions of an arrogant 
papacy, and placed under an interdict, was cham- 
pioned by Sarpi, and emerged triumphant from 
the struggle. This situation offers splendid mater- 
ial for the historical novelist, and it has here been 



put to most effective use. Combined with it we 
have a tale of private love and suffering, of love 
between a young patrician and a daughter of the 
people, of suffering that grows out of the wife's 
divided allegiance to her husband and the interests 
of the state, on the one hand, and to her religious 
ideals, on the other. For in all this terrible matter 
of the interdict, the heroine remains steadfast in 
her faith that the Church must be right, and when 
the Church is defied by those whom she holds 
dearest, her life is slowly sapped away in a sort of 
spiritual agony. This woman, who displays the 
soul of a St. Catherine amid the evils that beset 
her, is studied with rare insight and sympathy ; 
she almost persuades us to espouse her cause, 
although reason asserts it to be the cause of igno- 
rance against knowledge, of tyranny against free- 
dom. This book is much the most important that 
Mrs. Turnbull has yet written ; for in it she for the 
first time comes down from the clouds, and plants 
herself upon solid earth, yet relinquishes no essen- 
tial part of the insuperable idealism which is her 
most marked characteristic. 

" The Cobbler of Nimes," by Miss Mary Imlay 
Taylor, is a story of the Huguenot persecutions 
under Louis XIV. The scene is in the CeVennes 
region, and the time the beginning of the eight- 
eenth century. The story is a graceful idyl in 
the main, but it has a background of horrors, and 
the writer exercises an admirable restraint in keep- 
ing them in the background. The framework is 
slight, and constructed upon conventional lines, but 
Miss Taylor has the instinct of the story-teller, and 
the book is as pleasing as its four or five pre- 
decessors. 

Some years ago, a formless and fantastic piece 
of fiction entitled " Etidorhpa " was published, and 
found its way to a limited circle of readers. It 
was the work of Mr. John Uri Lloyd, of Cincin- 
nati, a chemist by profession, and the conceit of 
the title (which was merely " Aphrodite " reversed) 
seemed typical of the unregulated sort of imagina- 
tion which the book displayed. It certainly gave 
no promise of further work on conventional lines, 
and it is something of a surprise to find in " String- 
town on the Pike," Mr. Lloyd's second production, 
a novel sufficiently like the run of current fiction 
to admit of classification. This book is a picture 
of life in a Kentucky country town during the 
period of the Civil War. Its method is that of 
realism, and its plot is one of considerable interest. 
Amateurish and ill-balanced though it be, it some- 
how has got the trick of holding our attention, and 
even of persuading us to make our way through 
many tangled pages of a peculiarly difficult species 
of negro dialect. The principal character, in fact, 
is that of old Cupe, whose strange mental processes 
and superstitious beliefs enable the author to make 
a rich exhibit of negro folk-lore. These super- 
stitions are used too seriously as a motive in the 
plot, but they are woven into the fabric of the 
narrative with great ingenuity, and the impression

THE DIAL, 



made by them is distinctly uncanny. The various 
types of white character are delineated with no 
little skill, and it must be said that the author has 
the instinct of the novelist, although lacking in the 
technical training. There is a fresh vigor about 
his book that atones for many faults, and, as one 
dramatic or melodramatic situation succeeds an- 
other, one cannot fail to be impressed by the fer- 
tility of resource displayed, as well as by the fund 
of keen observation from which the author has 
been able to draw. 

Being an eminent mathematician and astronomer 
does not prevent Mr. Simon Newcomb from being 
several other things with almost equal success. Some 
years ago, be published a treatise on political econ- 
omy which must have been something of a surprise 
even to those who knew him best, for it was the 
work of a man who had mastered the subject, and 
compared favorably with the productions of the 
best professional economists. Now Mr. Newcomb 
has turned novelist for a change, and has written a 
romance of the scientific imagination which is also 
a distinctly successful production. It is called "His 
Wisdom the Defender," and tells the story of a 
new kind of air-ship. Strictly speaking, the inven- 
tion is more than an air-ship, for it enables its in- 
ventor so to defy the law of gravitation that he 
soars above the atmosphere and circumnavigates 
the globe in the medium of the luminiferous ether. 
The invention is put to a philanthropic purpose, for 
it is made the means of doing away with warfare, 
and establishing an era of universal peace. How 
the great powers are forced to accept the situation, 
how their forces are disarmed and their navies 
sunk, are matters that go to make up a tale as 
startling as any told by M. Jules Verne, and a 
tale, moreover, that even to the searching criticism 
of exact science has no slight degree of verisimili- 
tude. There is also a mere hint of a love story, 
but this might as well have been suppressed, for it 
affords the least realistic feature of the book, and 
is the product of a too visible effort. 

" Rafnaland," by Mr. W. H. Wilson, is also a 
story of an air-ship, but in this case we have to do 
with a simple balloon, not with a new form of en- 
ergy. A young man become an aeronaut malgri 
lui drifts northward to the very pole, and there 
discovers a habitable country, populated by a Norse 
colony that had sought refuge for themselves and 
their gods some thousand years before, at the time 
when Christianity was being forced upon their re- 
luctant kinsfolk by the method of fire and sword. 
Here in their new home these Norsemen had pre- 
served their faith, their language, and their an- 
cient customs, and here our hero was made welcome 
and adopted into the race. The fair Astrid consoles 
him for the loss of home and kindred, and the love 
interest is made conspicuous, although agreeably 
varied by fighting and other forms of diversion. 
We find ourselves fairly plunged into the life of 
the sagas, and their spirit is skilfully reproduced 
by the writer's invention. In the end, the hero and 



the heroine take flight in the old balloon reinflated 
with volcanic hydrogen and are fated to die of 
cold and exposure. But their story has been written 
out, and is brought back to civilization by the ship 
that discovers their remains.

At the head of the season's list of art works 
proper must be placed Lady Dilke's scholarly and 
superbly illustrated treatise on the chief " French 
Architects and Sculptors of the XVIIIth Century " 
(Macmillan). The volume is designed to carry 
forward and supplement the work begun last year 
in the same author's " French Painters of the 
XVIIIth Century," and the system followed is the 
same. The artists chosen for treatment are those 
who left most plainly their impress on the art of 
their time, and whose spirit and treatment reflected 
most clearly the ideals distinctive of their century. 
The architects are seen to be engaged largely in 
solving the problems peculiar to a day of transition 
in remodelling and adapting the old, and bring- 
ing it into closer correspondence with modern ideals 
of comfort and convenience. The sculptors give 
a new direction to the fanciful "sculpture d'ap- 
partement," and assert their independence giving 
to the statue, and then to the statuette, a new sig- 
nificance. Many of the finest achievements of 
masters like Guillaume Coustou fils, Pigalle, Hou- 
don, Clod ion, Falconnet, Lemoyne, Caffieri, are 
little known even in their own country ; and one is 
glad to see justice done them in this beautiful and 
solidly wrought work. " My object," says Lady 
Dilke, " is to trace the traditions by which the chief 
amongst these men were guided ; to give such an 
account of their lives as may render them some- 
thing more than mere names to us ; to bring order 
into our conception of their works ; and to support 
the conclusions of the text by typical illustrations 
of their performance." We shall not attempt here 
to particularize as to the character and attractions of 
these beautiful and, in many cases, unfamiliar de- 
signs. They are finely reproduced ; and we counsel 
the reader of artistic tastes not to rob himself of a 
genuine pleasure through failing to inspect them. 
The volume is superbly printed, and in every phy- 
sical regard worthy of its content. 

Eloquent with the echoes of an enchanting by- 
gone world is the noble volume containing a trans- 
lation, by Florence Simmonds and M. Jourdain, 
of Pierre Gusman's "Pompeii: The City, its Life 
and Art" (Dodd). M. Gusman's encyclopaedic 
book is first of all a work of laboriously won archae- 
ological knowledge; it is also a work of consci- 
entiously restrained and disciplined historical 
imagination, through every page of which the 
writer's enthusiasm shines. M. Gusman has not 
attempted a complete imaginary reconstruction of

Pompeii, that is to say, his work is not vitiated 
by the element of mere conjecture. But he has 
honestly tried to so marshal and interpret the many 
and graphic evidences we have of the life and 
architectural aspect of the buried city as to make 
it live again for us as nearly as possible. In his 
own words, his book is " a history of the Pompei- 
ans, illustrated by themselves." The volume opens 
with a short historical review ; then follow chapters 
severally headed : The Tombs, the Temples and 
the Various Cults ; Public Buildings and Recrea- 
tions of Pompei ; The Streets Inscriptions 
Industries; The Giaeco-Roman House; The Arts. 
The illustrations are on a lavish scale, and would 
seem to leave no phase of Pompeian life untouched. 
They consist of 500 text illustrations and twelve 
colored plates, from drawings by the author. The 
volume is one of the handsomest of the season's 
gift-books, and it forms a rich mine of entertain- 
ment and instruction. 

Mr. Joel Cook's " America : Picturesque and 
Descriptive " is issued in three well-manufactured 
and beautifully- illustrated volumes by Messrs. 
Henry T. Coates & Co. Mr. Cook's object is to 
give the busy reader who has no time or opportunity 
for travel such comprehensive general knowledge 
as every intelligent American ought to have of the 
geography, history, picturesque attractions, local 
peculiarities, and so on, of his own country. Mr. 
Cook's descriptions are concise and literal, and are 
the result largely of notes taken by him during 
years of extended travel in the United States and 
Canada. The work is arranged in twenty-one 
tours, each volume beginning at the older settle- 
ments upon the Atlantic sea-board, and each 
" tour " describing a route such as the traveller 
would ordinarily take from the given starting-point. 
Mr. Cook has skimmed in his sight-seeing flights 
the main points of interest in this country pretty 
comprehensively, and he gives us glimpses of Can- 
ada and Alaska as well. The information conveyed 
is necessarily superficial, but it is certainly such as 
none of us should be without. The book is of no 
literary pretension, which is doubtless a point in its 
favor. The photogravure plates, of which there are 
a great many, are well chosen as to subject, and 
are, in point of execution, notably meritorious 
specimens of their kind. 

Those wisest of classics, the ' Meditations of 
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus " and the " Essayes or 
Counsels " of Francis Bacon, reappear this season 
in particularly alluring companion editions, under 
the joint imprint of J. M. Dent & Co. of London 
and E. P. Dutton & Co. of New York. The 
" Meditations" are given in Casaubon's translation, 
under the editorship of Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, who 
supplies an Introduction, with Glossary and Ap- 
pendix. Casaubon's version is printed without 
emendation, though the cumbersome and confusing 
brackets of the original editions are omitted, as are 
the discursive and not strictly elucidatory notes. Mr. 
Walter Worrall is the editor of the " Essayes," an 



excellent Introduction is provided by Mr. Oliphant 
Stneaton, and several useful Appendices are in- 
cluded. The text followed is that of 1625, Bacon's 
final and complete edition. The spelling and punc- 
tuation have been " modernized," and we are glad 
to note that the errors usually incident to this pro- 
cess seem here to have been avoided. Both volumes 
are light to the hand, and the strong and handsome 
typography is most inviting. The numerous plates 
in photogravure, rubricated head and tail pieces, 
initials, and chapter-headings, and the exquisite 
cover-designs, complete an exterior ensemble at once 
elegant and dainty. For a friend of cultivated 
tastes we can suggest no better gift-books than 
these. 

Bound in white, the two volumes decorated with 
the lymphad which forms the distinctive heraldic 
emblem of the city, the late Grant Allen's " Paris " 
(Page) forms a beautiful addition to the half guide- 
book, half history, series which is so much in vogue 
at the present time. The illustrations are numerous 
and pertinent, the facade of Notre Dame being 
represented in the frontispiece of the first volume 
and the Venus de Milo in that of the second. The 
narrative is planned as an artistic itinerary for the 
sojourner in the French capital, and the pains he 
may take to follow its directions will bear fruit in 
the thoroughness with which the real beauties of 
the French capital will disclose themselves to his 
searching eyes. Especially valuable is a chapter or 
two on " How to Study Paintings in the Louvre." 
Though Grant Allen was rather a man of science 
than an art student or critic, he was also a man 
of judgment and taste, and his instructions can 
be made to bear fruit in even the most ordinary 
hands. 

A tastefully embellished, pleasantly and tactfully 
written, book is Virginia Tatnall Peacock's " Famous 
American Belles of the Nineteenth Century " 
(Lippincott). The author has selected her subjects 
not alone for the distinction of personal charm, but 
also for the qualities which contribute to social and, 
in a sense, political eminence, as is evinced by 
the inclusion of such names as Elizabeth Patterson, 
Margaret O'Neill, Harriet Lane, Kate Chase, 
Etnilie Schaumburg, Jennie Jerome, and so on. 
There are nineteen names in the list, which begins 
with Marcia Burns, and closes with Mary Victoria 
Leiter. The portraits are both charming and 
interesting (the initial one is printed in colors), 
and the delicate binding of light-blue and gilt 
rounds out a harmonious whole. 

We should not care to be the owner of mind 
insensible to the manifold attractions of the new 
Holiday edition of Mr. James Lane Allen's " A Ken- 
tucky Cardinal" (Macmillan). To illustrate the 
charming story seems like painting the lily ; but 
we admit, now we have inspected them, inhaled 
their dainty, subtly suggestive fragrance, as it 
were, that the one hundred drawings by Hugh 
Thomson which form the main new feature of the 
edition strikes us as having been all along the one

element needed to make Mr. Allen's story perfect 
in its kind. There is also a delightful Introduc- 
tion by Mr. Allen, and the volume contains the 
sequel, " Aftermath," as well. The cover of light 
green shows a design in gilt of Chaucerian sug- 
gestiveness birds and boughs and leafy sprays, 
etc. All in all, the volume is one of the tastefullest 
in its class this season. 

There is no end to books about Paris, nor, we 
suppose, to the demand for them. All sanguine 
people hope to get to Paris some day ; and the 
prudent ones like to " read up " beforehand, to be 
ready for the blessed contingency when it hap- 
pens. The latest book of the kind, and one, we 
should think, distinctly meant for the behoof of the 
sanguine souls aforesaid, is Mr. E. A. Reynolds- 
Ball's two-volume work called " Paris in its Splen- 
dor " (Dana Estes & Co.). The book is mainly 
descriptive, though there is a vein of history run- 
ning through it. The author says that he has tried 
to give a general impression of Paris past and 
present, and of the more striking features of the 
social life of Paris of today. On its guide book 
side (and it is really a superior sort of guide to 
Paris and its worthier sights) the book furnishes 
much information as to museums and picture- 
galleries, historic churches, monuments, historic 
spots and buildings, parks, drives, and gardens, 
and so on. The volumes are handsomely made 
fine paper, excellent print, and exquisite covers of 
white-and-gold, protected by red slip-covers. There 
are 65 photographic plates. 

Of panoramic quality is the flat oblong volume, 
entitled " The War in South Africa " (P. F. Collier 
& Son), containing Captain A. T. Mahan's valuable 
account of the Anglo-Boer conflict from the opening 
of hostilities to the fall of Pretoria. An Introduc- 
tion is supplied by Sir John G. Bourinot, and the 
book, on the whole, seems to be the coolest and 
most impersonal (and therefore the most instructive 
as to facts) narrative of the military side of the 
deplorable South African business that has yet ap- 
peared. The copious and striking photographic 
pictures, a number of which are reproduced in 
colors, have the effect of transporting one in fancy 
to the scene of hostilities, and are of undeniable 
interest. 

Good to look at and pleasant to read are the 
two comely little volumes entitled " Rambles in 
Colonial Byways" (Lippincott). In them the 
author sets forth in pleasing style the result of his 
observations during a series of leisurely jaunts to 
various nooks and byways in New England and 
New York, and alofig the Hudson, in Pennsylvania 
and through Washington's country, the spots vis- 
ited being such as are memorable for their associa- 
tions and souvenirs of Colonial and Revolutionary 
days. A set of charming photographic plates 
serves to adorn the work and vivify the text. 
Particularly pretty are the bindings in grass-green 
buckram stamped with a view of a colonial house 
and garden. 



The death last April of that gentle pictorial 
satirist of our national errors, political and other, 
Francis Gilbert Attwood, left a void in the pages 
of New York's bright little periodical, " Life," not 
easily supplied. Mr. Attwood's drawings were 
always clear, significant, wholesome. It was sel- 
dom that they failed of a palpable hit. They were 
delightfully humorous, and their humor was gener- 
ally of the subtler sort that appeals to the intelli- 
gence. Most of them were contributed to " Life," 
and the publishers of that periodical now issue the 
best of them collected in chronological sequence in 
a neat volume entitled "Attwood's Pictures." 
Thus arranged they form a pleasant pictorial his- 
tory, in the satirist's vein, mainly, of the closing 
decade of the past century. There is never any 
mistaking Mr. Attwood's meaning, and his 
portraits, for all their humor, are recognizable 
at once. 

The Fleming H. Revell Company issue, in a 
well-made quarto volume, " The Psalms of David," 
with sixteen full-page drawings and numerous dec- 
orations by Louis Rhead, and an introductory 
study of the psalmist by the Rev. Newell Dwight 
Hillis. Mr. Rhead's pictures are much in the 
style of his contributions to the pictorial " Pil- 
grim's Progress " of a season or so ago, and his 
decorations are simple and do not overbalance the 
clear and open print, which shows to advantage 
against a white-margined ground of delicate vel- 
lum-tint. In his introductory study Dr. Hillis tells 
in an agreeable way the story of David's life, and 
points out its bearings upon the general scheme of 
human conduct. The volume is richly bound in 
claret-color and gold, and forms an obviously suit- 
able Christmas gift. 

Mr. Sadakichi Hartmann announces in his preface 
to "Shakespeare in Art " (Page) that he is excep- 
tionally well qualified for the task he has underta- 
ken, having given himself such a preparation 
through a series of years as few men can pretend 
to. The intention of his work is to present in a 
form necessarily brief because of the magnitude of 
the undertaking some account of the various forms 
of art and the notable examples in each form 
which have busied themselves in picturing Shake- 
speare or his characters. The first chapter deals 
with the portraits a threshing out of old straw 
which neither enlarges nor diminishes our custom- 
ary knowledge of the subject. Other sections of 
the book have to do with the illustrators and with 
the painters, etchers, engravers, and sculptors who 
have enhanced their own and the great dramatist's 
fame by their works. The Droeshout etching is 
used as a frontispiece for the volume, and there are 
numerous half-tone reproductions of famous paint- 
ings and portraits scattered throughout the pages. 

Mr. Louis C. Elson has performed a valuable 
service for the student in his new book with the 
explanatory title, u Shakespeare in Music : A Col- 
lation of the Chief Musical Allusions in the Plays 
of Shakespeare, with an Attempt at Their Explan-

ation and Derivation, together with Much of the 
Original Music" (Page). Nothing so extensive 
of the kind has been attempted heretofore, nor 
has any result quite so thorough been achieved, 
the combination of musical and dramatic know- 
ledge which does not burn itself out in attention to 
opera being unusual. Profusely illustrated, both 
with pictures and musical scores, with a learned 
dissertation on the dances of the time by way of 
good measure, Mr. Elson has produced a work of 
considerable authority and great interest. Among 
the few omissions of the book is to be noted a fail- 
ure to grasp the significance of the Irish tongue as 
affording a key to certain obscurely un-English 
expressions in the text of the dramas. Nor should 
the sub-title have limited itself to " plays " alone, 
the poems being frequently expounded in respect 
of their musical references. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s commendable 
" Coxhoe " edition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 
Complete Works comprises six volumes (18uao, 
4x6 inches), enclosed in a strong case with hinged 
cover. Each volume contains a frontispiece in pho- 
togravure. The editing, by Charlotte Porter and 
Helen A. Clarke, has been carefully and helpfully 
done, and the initial volume is supplied with a 
Biographical Introduction and Bibliography. The 
edition is convenient and desirable ; and its general 
get-up is suggestive of presentation uses. 

More Omar ! The volume this time contains 
Fitzgerald's versions of the Ruba*iyt, a Life of 
Fitzgerald, some verses to Omar by Justin H. 
McCarthy, a poem by Porter Garnett, a batch of 
Notes, a Life of Omar quite enough for one's 
money. But to make the volume thicker yet its 
leaves of rather heavy calendered paper are 
doubled, so that, despite the quantitative thinness 
of its piece de resistance, we get a fairly thick 
octavo after all. Omar is difficult to illustrate, 
but Miss Florence Lundborg has tried hard to do 
him some sort of justice in this publication. Candor 
compels us to say that where Vedder succeeded 
indifferently well, Miss Lundborg has scarcely 
succeeded at all. Her drawings smack a little 
of Vedder's wild and whirling symbolizations. 
They smack perhaps more of Aubrey Beardsley 
of whose fantasticalities we have surely had enough. 
We sincerely wish Miss Lundborg better luck next 
time in point of subject, for she deserves it. The 
volume is heavy to the hand, and its cover shows 
an uninviting combination in dull chocolate and 
black. (Doxey's.) 

Miss Margaret Armstrong is well and deserv- 
edly to the fore this season as a decorative artist, 
and in Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s ornate edition 
of Browning's " Pippa Passes " she acquits herself 
creditably as an illustrator proper as well. The 
decorations of the volume are very profuse, the 
main feature being the marginal borders and semi- 
borders showing a medley of designs in figures, 
symbols, slightly conventionalized foliage, flowers, 
fruit, etc. A border of very light vellum-tint 



surrounds the text of each page, and serves as an 
effective ground for the drawings. The cover is 
decidedly one of the prettiest of the year, and the 
publication, all in all, is well conceived and well 
wrought out. 

The richly colored and gilded cover-design, pro- 
fuse illustrations, and illuminated title-page lend 
distinction to the outer ensemble of the seasonable 
gift-book entitled " Women of the Bible " (Harper). 
The text consists of twelve sketches of Biblical 
heroines Eve, Sarah, Miriam, Ruth, Esther, 
Mary the Mother of Jesus, etc. from the pens of 
as many eminent divines, Dr. Lyman Abbott, Dr. 
Henry Van Dyke, Cardinal Gibbons, Bishop Hurst, 
Bishop Potter, and others. The learned and rev- 
erend writers havf treated their respective themes 
gracefully and entertainingly, as well as instruct- 
ively ; so that the book, with its liberal embellish- 
ments, is one to charm as well as edify. 

A temper as sweet and as contemplative as Wal- 
ton's, a sense for the subtler facts of nature as fine 
as Jefferies's, lend distinction among works of its 
class to Dr. Charles C. Abbott's " In Nature's 
Realm" (Albert Brandt, Trenton), a charming 
volume which we have already had occasion to 
praise. For the comparatively uninitiated votary 
of Nature, who would study her in all her moods 
and divine her best-kept secrets, we know of no 
better or pleasanter guide, philosopher, and friend, 
than Dr. Abbott. The volume is suitably illus- 
trated by Oliver Kemp, and we are glad especially 
to call attention to the typographical beauty of the 
book and to the exceptional quality of the material 
used in its manufacture a feature characteristic 
of all of this publisher's productions that we have 
seen. 

The exquisite setting bestowed by its publishers 
upon Eugene Field's newspaper skit entitled " The 
Temptation of Friar Gonsol " (Woodward & 
Lothrop) will be a matter of some wonderment to 
readers outside the circle of Mr. Field's old 
familiars, and therefore unable to appreciate the 
local and personal hits which are the life of the 
piece, such as it has. The fun of " Friar Gonsol " 
is not of a side-splitting order, in any case. Out- 
wardly the volume is very pretty and artistic. It 
contains several portraits of the author, a facsimile 
of the " proof " of " Friar Gonsol," and so on. The 
cover is of semi flexible white vellum tied with 
cherry ribbons, and the edition is limited to three 
hundred copies. 

" Contemporary American Composers," by Rupert 
Hughes, and " Famous Pianists of To-Day and Yes- 
terday," by Henry C. Lahee, form a brace of ac- 
ceptable additions to Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s 
pretty and convenient '' Music Lovers' Series." Mr. 
Hughes has written a well considered and rather 
comprehensive critical study of contemporary na- 
tive music, and his researches have led him to the 
cheerful conclusion that some of the very best mod- 
ern music is being written here at home, and only 
needs the light to secure its due meed of praise.

THE DIAL

Mr. Haghes's industry is patent throughout the 
book, and we admit the force of his contention that 
the fact that he has gone through " at least a ton 
of American compositions " with undiminished en- 
thusiasm is evidence of some virtue in native music 
examples of which, by the way, he reproduces. 
Among the composers treated in the volume are Ed- 
ward MacDowell, John P. Souaa, Henry Schoene- 
feld, G. W. Chadwick, Harry Rowe Shelley, F. F. 
Bullard, A. J. Goodrich, Margaret Ruthven, Lang, 
etc. More biographical in treatment are Mr. 
Lahee's sketches of " Famous Pianists," issued by 
the same firm, in the same series. The names are 
arranged as nearly as possible in chronological or- 
der, and the list includes, besides artists of world- 
wide reputation, the best known local pianists, both 
of Europe and America. Mr. Lahee writes agree- 
ably, and with ample knowledge of his theme. Each 
volume is liberally equipped with portraits, and 
each forms a pretty and suitable gift for a music- 
loving friend. 

Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet's comprehensive series 
of sketches of " Women of the American Revolu- 
tion " is deservedly republished in attractive form 
and with a generous array of portraits, by Messrs. 
George W. Jacobs & Co. Mrs. Anne Hollingsworth 
Wharton supplies a needed Introduction. The 
table of contents shows a long list of names, many 
of which will doubtless be unfamiliar to most read- 
ers, but none of which seem to be unworthy of 
inclusion. Mrs. Ellet's sketches were written long 
before the current fad for things Colonial showed 
itself, and this may be considered by some a point 
in their favor. Her material, too, was gathered 
at a time when it was still possible to question wit- 
nesses who could speak from memory directly to 
the facts, and hence, as Mrs. Wharton notes, there 
are many passages in the book in which the fruit 
of such gleaning is manifest in the vividness and 
circumstantiality with which scenes and characters 
are depicted. 

Dividing the sexes with a Shaker-like strictness, 
Mr. Lewis C. Strang prepares two volumes of con- 
temporaneous dramatic history, calling one " Prima 
Donnas and Soubrettes " and the other, " Cel- 
ebrated Comedians," using the same sub-title for 
both " of Light Opera and Musical Comedy in 
America" (Page). The two volumes, bound in 
white for Christmas gifts, have the same general 
plan and treatment throughout. Mr. Strang's 
concern is with singers and comedians whose at- 
tractions still pass current among us, and in this 
regard he is catholic in his tastes. In one volume 
Misses Alice Nielson, Lillian Russell, Virginia 
Earle, Fay Templeton, Delia Fox, Josephine Hall, 
Mesdames Edna Wallace Hopper, Jessie Bartlett 
Davis, and others of their sisters find place beside 
such professional " entertainers " as Miss Marie 
Dressier and Miss Maud Raymond, and are dis- 
cussed in a breezy, newspaperish manner. In the 
other volume inclusiveness also is sought rather 
than particularity, such extremes as Mr. Henry 



Clay Barnabee and Mr. Francis Wilson, Mr. Digby 
Bell and the Rogers Brothers, Mr. Frank E. Dan- 
iels and Mr. Peter F. Dailey, Mr. Henry E. Dixey 
and Mr. Otis Harlan meeting in the pages. The 
two books speak more for American good nature 
than American art, either musical or histrionic. 
Numerous half-tone reproductions of photographs 
decorate the volumes. 

A rather happy conception is embodied in the 
desirable volume entitled " Wonders of Nature " 
(Dodd), the contents of which have been edited, 
and in some instances translated, by Miss Esther 
Singleton. The book is a compilation of descrip- 
tions by writers of more or less celebrity, of striking 
natural views and scenic phenomena, the principle 
or ground of selection being subjectiveness of treat- 
ment and literary merit, rather than topographical 
or scientific accuracy and interest. The selections 
have been made with taste, and where translation 
has been called for it has been gracefully and intel- 
ligently done. There are forty-six papers in all, and 
nearly as many full-page plates in half-tone, which 
are of acceptable quality. Those seeking models of 
style in this order of descriptive writing will find 
the book a treasure-house of examples. 

Mrs. Sarah P. McL. Greene's racy New England 
novel " Vesty of the Basins " (Harper) has already 
won its way to public favor, and we are glad to see 
it reissued in tempting Holiday dress, of which the 
main feature is the many illustrations from draw- 
ings by Otto H. Bacher and from photographs by 
Clifton Johnson. Mr. Johnson's photographs serve 
to accentuate the local flavor of the book, while its 
"daown East" drollery and quiet sentiment are 
faithfully reflected in Mr. Bacher's designs. A 
welcome addition is the frontispiece portrait of the 
author. 

" The Friendly Year " (Scribner) is a little year- 
book of selections in prose and verse, an extract 
for each day, from the works of Dr. Henry van 
Dyke, chosen and arranged by the Rev. George 
Sidney Webster. An extract from these cheery 
and wholesome writings is a good thing certainly 
to begin the day with, and Dr. Webster's little an- 
thology should find friends. In indicating his prin- 
ciple of selection the editor says: "I have not 
sought to illustrate literary qualities, so much as to 
bring out the dominant note of human friendliness 
and comradeship, which runs through the writings 
of an author who knows books well, but who cares 
more for people." A portrait of Dr. van Dyke 
forms the frontispiece. 

The very presentable yet moderate-priced new 
edition of Fenimore Cooper published by the 
Macmillan Co. opens promisingly with " The Last 
of the Mohicans." The volume a handy, full 
gilt, rather closely but legibly-printed 12 mo in 
light-green binding is prefaced by a general 
Introduction on Cooper by Mr. Mowbray Morris, 
and contains twenty-five drawings of good quality 
by Mr. H. M. Brock. We are glad to say that 
Mr. Brock has not unduly " Remington! zed " his

author, but has impliedly recognized in his romance- 
tinged designs the fact that we go to Cooper for 
the solace that comes from shaking off for the 
nonce the real and the literal, and that we would 
therefore be likely to prove the reverse of grateful 
to the artist who might persist in thrusting it back 
upon us every few pages in his provokingly matter- 
of-fact pictures. 

In "The Pilgrim Shore" (Little, Brown, & Co.) 
Mr. E. H. Garrett has done for the South Shore 
of Massachusetts Bay what he did for the North 
Shore of New England in his " Romance and 
Reality of the Puritan Coast." The whole South 
Shore and its towns, Dorchester, Neponset, Quincy, 
Weymouth, Hingham, Hull, Duxbury, Plymouth, 
etc., is treated in this volume. There are many 
full-page drawings and vignettes, the treatment 
mingling description and fancy in due proportions. 
The book is pleasantly written, and makes a brave 
showing in its tasteful binding of white and gold. 

Considerable amusement may be found in Mr. 
Gay Wetmore Carry 1's " Mother Goose for Grown- 
Ups" (Harper), and we should be sorry to possess 
the soul that could see nothing funny in Mr. Peter 
Newell's illustrations in the same. Mr. Carryl has 
adapted the old nursery jingles in much the same 
manner as he dealt with the fables of La Fontaine 
some time since. Mr. Newell has a humor all his 
own ; but his debt as an artist to Boutet de Monvel 
is plain. Other drawings in the book are by Mr. 
Gustave Verbeck. 

Charles Lever's rollicking song of " Tipperary 
Joe," which readers of " Jack Hinton, the Guards- 
man " will remember, makes its appearance, re- 
christened " The Song of a Vagabond Huntsman " 
(Russell), in a flat oblong volume, with a gayly 
colored frontispiece and a number of other pictures 
in monotint, all the work of Wm. Anderson Sher- 
wood. Mr. Sherwood's drawings, of which there 
are one to each verse, faithfully reflect the humor 
of the song, and the book should certainly find 
favor in the Hibernian eye. 

Mr. Oliver Herford's skill in versification lends 
a certain distinction to most of the whimsically 
humorous verse in his little book of collected poems 
entitled "Overheard in a Garden" (Scribner). 
The book is full of pretty conceits and neatly- 
turned rhymes, and the drawings, also by Mr. Her- 
ford, duly reflect the spirit of the text. The cover- 
design, in colors, is quaintly fancied, and tempts 
one to peep within. 

The quaint fun of that funniest of our illustra- 
tors, F. Opper, is pleasantly exemplified in the 
thirty odd drawings, each with its accompanying 
scrap of verse, contained in the flat folio volume 
entitled "The Folks in Funnyville " (Russell). 
Mr. Opper's pictures are always irresistible, and 
while his humor is broad, it is never vulgar a 
decided merit in a day when there is no little tempt- 
ation from press and public to eschew it. 

The publishers of " Life " have issued, under the 
title, "Fore! Life's Book for Golfers," a flat 



quarto volume wherein are set forth pictorially the 
ways and humors of the votaries of the fashionable 
game. The pictures are cleverly drawn, and the 
book seems a capital one to while away spare 
moments at the country club. 

Lovers of choice book-making will be strongly 
tempted by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s artistic yet 
venturesome edition of Sterne's " Sentimental Jour- 
ney." The volume is rather freely rubricated, and 
its color element is accentuated by the boldly ex- 
ecuted frontispiece in black, dark-green, and red,. 
showing the immortal traveller about to hand the 
lady into the Desobligeant. 

Two trim little volumes entitled "American Wit 
and Humor " (Jacobs) are devoted, as the reader 
may surmise, to funny sayings culled from the 
columns of the comic papers, and from the " comic 
columns " of papers not wholly comic. The con- 
tents of the volumes are conveniently arranged, 
and those who relish newspaper fun may find the 
cream of it skimmed deftly into these two little 
books, each of which contains a frontispiece por- 
trait Dr. Holmes and Mark Twain, respectively, 
though how Dr. Holmes got into such company 
we are at a loss to conjecture. 

We have not heretofore, so far as we remember,, 
been called upon to notice a set of illustrative draw- 
ings by Florence Goldsmith Chandler, whose name 
as an illustrator is new to us ; but we take pleasure 
now in commending the fine poetic feeling and 
graceful sentiment apparent in her fifteen full-page 
designs which embellish the chastely ornate volume 
of devotional poems, entitled " Psalms of Soul," by 
William Bradford Dickson, published by the Tri- 
bune Co., of South Bend, Indiana. Mr. Diekson's 
verses are warmed throughout with real religious 
fervor, and their formal quality is respectable. The 
publishers have shown good taste in the make-up 
of the volume. 

Very dainty and fraught with mementos of sun- 
nier days are the twin anthologies of poems about 
flowers and poems about birds, respectively entitled 
" Among the Flowers " and " Among the Birds" 
(Estes), each volume brightened with its series of 
gayly-colored plates. The selections in each book 
are made with taste, and mostly from the standard 
poets. The volumes are portable and pocketable ; 
and either would form a pleasant companion for a 
ramble in places where, it is good to know, birds 
and flowers will again abound. 

Goldsmith's "She Stoops to Conquer," impec- 
cably printed, and liberally strewn with drawings 
by E. A. Abbey, is wine of the sort that needs no 
bush. The book was a favorite several seasons ago, 
and now makes its reappearance in a new binding 
of unique design. (Harper.) 

Mr. Edwin Markham's harrowing production 
(no pun intended), "The Man with the Hoe," is 
now included in the dainty " Lark Editions " 
(Doxey's) of popular modern verse, so that the 
American farmer who likes a portrayal of himself 
as a " monstrous thing distorted and soul- quenched "

may have it in a pretty and pocketable volume at 
a moderate price. The artistic decorations in car- 
mine and black, by Mr. Porter Garnett, help to 
make an attractive page, and there is a well- 
executed frontispiece after Millet. 

" Beautiful Thoughts from Robert and Eliza- 
beth Browning " (Pott) is a pretty volume of selec- 
tions from the writings of these poets, a pageful 
for each day in the year. The book is ornately 
bound in sage-green and gold, with vignette of Mr. 
Browning; and the editor, Miss Margaret Shipp, 
has done her work with taste and discernment. 

Dr. Maltbie D. Babcock, whose calendar last 
year attracted attention through its pious and sen- 
tentious aspirations for each day of the year, has 
issued " Dr. Babcock's Calendar for 1901 " (John 
S. Bridges & Co.), making not only the necessary 
changes for another year, but adding numerous 
significant thoughts aptly expressed, at the same 
time rewriting many of the older ones. 

Mr. Curtin's good version of Sienkiewicz's fine 
prose poem " The Judgment of Peter and Paul on 
Olympus " is brought out by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. in an attractive booklet delicately bound in 
white, with illustrations. A pleasing page has been 
made by printing the text in violet, with a marginal 
frame in light-green.

The Vulgate would have us read that the 
salutation of the heavenly choir is not for 
all mankind, but is to he translated, " Peace 
on earth to men of good will ! " What, then, of the 
books of war and rumors of war which continue to hold 
the first place (if numbers are a proof) in the reading 
provided for the young at this time ? History, it is 
true, is as bloody as a butcher's shambles; but need it 
remain so ? The first book of the group before us, in 
point of time, is by Mr. Edward Robins, a plentifully 
illustrated account of a most disastrous rout, entitled 
"With Washington in Braddock's Campaign " (Jacobs). 
It gives an excellent impression of Washington in the 
first flush of his manhood, and introduces that General 
Gage whom he was to shut up in Boston not very many 
years later. Yet Washington was greatest because of 
his hold on the hearts of his countrymen, and he was 
first in peace as well as first in war. This latter phase 
of his character is obscured in such a work, interesting 
as it is in other respects. Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth 
rescues the incident of the Knight of the Golden Horse- 
shoe from ill-deserved oblivion by preparing " In the 
Days of Jefferson; or, The Six Golden Horseshoes, a 
Tale of Republican Simplicity " (Appleton), a story of 
continental expansion and of Jefferson's youth and 
manhood, the more striking because it is a book with 
little or no bloodshed. Mr. Frank T. Merrill provides 
the drawings for the volume, which is one to be read 
and pondered over, even though the Jeffersonian enthu- 
siast may fancy he detects a note of something less than 
complete approbation for the hero in the hero's present 
biographer. Aggression to-day must certainly revive 
tales of aggression yesterday, so the announcement of 



a series of three books concerning the Mexican War,, 
from the busy pen of Captain Ralph Bonehill, is not to- 
be wondered at, though Americans generally have leffc 
that unfortunate conflict to deserved silence. But the 
first of the three books, " For the Liberty of Texas " 
(Estes), dealing as it does with San Antonio and the 
Alamo and ending with the battle of San Jacinto, does 
not bring forward the facts which led Abraham Lincoln 
to his cordial detestation of President Polk. " Trav- 
ellers' Tales of South Africa " (Estes) is also by Mr. 
Hezekiah Butterworth, with illustrations drawn from 
numerous sources, a book which hardly does itself jus- 
tice with such a title. It contains some account of events 
in South Africa leading up to the present war, but its 
concern is even more with hunters and missionaries. 
Nor is the field limited to South Africa alone, the cen- 
tral portion of the continent coming in for a word of 

comment Mr. Edward Stratemeyer has a method 

the reverse of literary, but it enables him to bring out 
the sort of books that boys appear to like, or there 
could not be so many of them. " On to Pekin; or, Old 
Glory in China " (Lee & Shepard) is the latest of these, 
and those who are quite sure that American civilization 
has suffered nothing from its contact with the inhab- 
itants of China in recent months will find much to enjoy 
in the book. The hero has been met in others of the 
author's stories of battle, and there is much second- 
hand information about the scene of the war which is 
not a war. Historical frankness characterizes the 
Very Reverend Cyrus Townsend Brady's "Reuben 
James, a Hero of the Forecastle " (Appleton) to a 
remarkable extent. James is one of the most pictur- 
esque figures in American naval history, and his utter 
self-devotion in saving the life of the younger Decatur 
has been a favorite topic with American poets and 
prose writers alike. When Mr. James Jeffrey Roche 
composed his thrilling lines, he killed the sailor out of 
hand : a full-fledged hero who insists upon living 
many years, most of them in liquor, is more or less 
discouraging to poetry. But Mr. Brady tells the story 
of the brave man's life, and adds in an appendix nearly 
all that is said of him by others, concealing nothing. 

Last year Mr. Ralph Barbour wrote one 

and^entwe f the best b oks f the 8ea8on and he ha8 
repeated his performance this season with 

" For the Honor of the School, a Story of School Life 
and Interscholastic Sport" (Appleton). Hill ton, the 
institution of learning which was the scene of "The 
Half-Back," appears again in this second volume, and 
brings forth the regret that some real school had not 
been selected and named, after the fashion of " Tom 
Brown's School Days." Mr. Harbour's books are whole- 
some from cover to cover, interesting enough to hold 
the attention of any man who has not let his wits get 
" square-toed " also, in Thackeray's phrase, and without 
a bit of that forced romance which too many writers 
inject into boys' stories. Mr. C. M. Relyea's pictures- 
add to the reality of the incidents they represent It 

is not necessary to have a mean boy in a book, and Mr. 
Eustace Williams is right in making his protagonist sin 
in haste and repent at leisure in " The Substitute 
Quarter-Back " (Estes). The boy with whom the nar- 
rative is chiefly concerned, though he is not the hero in 
the usual sense of the word, betrays the signals of the 
school football team to its rival in revenge for having 
been taken off the first eleven and made a substitute 
just before the match. It is a delicate situation, but is 
well handled. Mr. L. J. Bridgman makes the pictures.

Mr. George Alfred Henty leaves English boys for a 
time, and deals with a young American and a young 
Mexican in his latest volume, "In the Hands of the 
Cave-Dwellers " (Harper). The title gives it a certain 
prehistoric sound, but the date goes back no further than 
1832, and the cave-dwellers are kindred to the Apaches 
of our southwestern frontier. The story is full of blood 
and adventure, with a bit of romance thrown in for good 
measure. Teaching the youthful idea how to shoot 
with a fowling-piece is the animating motive of " The 
Boy Duck -Hunters" (Estes), and the author, Mr. 
Frank E. Kellogg, has given his book real value by 
filling its pages full of useful information about the ap- 
pearance and habits of American game birds. Mr. 
J. W. Kennedy designs some of the pictures, but most 
of them are reproduced from Audubon's famous plates, 
making the work a treasure to the boy who inclines to- 
ward being a naturalist, as healthy boys generally do. 
" The Fortune Hunters of the Philippines " (Mershon 
Co.) sounds as if Senator Beveridge had invented the 
.title, but it is really much simpler than that. The au- 
thor, Mr. Louis Charles, wished a scene for the discovery 
of some buried Spanish treasure, and our new islands 
promised rather better than any others, so he sent his 
three American boys to Manila and its neighborhood. 
There is action enough in the book for twenty, and the 
reader draws a long breath when the wealth is safe in 

American hands " Bully, Fag and Hero " (Page), is 

the tale of an English public school. It abounds with 
scenes strange to American understandings, one of the 
principal personages of the story being the " Black 
Cadger," head game-keeper to a nobleman in the neigh- 
borhood of the school. The illustrations, by Mr. S. H. 
Vedder, are quite as realistic as the narrative, which 
is from the pen of Mr. Charles J. Mansford. Second 
of the " Woodranger Tales " (Page), by Mr. G. Waldo 
Browne, is " The Young Gunbearer." It deals with 
the condition of the Acadians whom Longfellow cel- 
ebrated in " Evangeline," as they were flourishing at 
the time of King George's War. The pictures, as in 
the earlier number of the series, are by Mr. Louis 
Meynell. 

Foremost among stories for girls we wel- 
NewbMkt C ome Miss Laura E. Richards's new vol- 
ume " Rita " (Estes), because it tells the 
story of a small Cuban patriot, daughter of a Spanish 
mother and American father, who is first and last for 
"Cuba libre!" "Dear is my country," said Francis 
Lieber, " but liberty is dearer." The sentiment is not 
a usual one in books intended for those who are to rock 
the cradle and rule the world in a few brief years. 
" For Tomniv, and Other Stories " (Estes) is also by 
Miss Laura E. Richards, and is for somewhat smaller 
girls. It has nothing to do with Christmas particularly, 
but it has " Moses " and ' Billy " and various other 
alluring young gentlemen scattered through the narra- 
tives in a convincing way. Mrs. L. T. Meade's excel- 
lently contrived stories are augmented by " A Plucky 
Girl " (Jacobs), an interesting account of the life of a 
young English gentlewoman who induces her mother to 
take " paying guests " after their fortune has given 
itself wings, to the advantage of all concerned in point 
of character-building, if not of comfort and ease. There 
is a hero, too, who makes his proper bow at the fall of 
the curtain, in the approved manner. Mrs. Moles- 
worth's " Three Witches " (Lippincott) are three young 
girls, who abundantly deserve the appellation. Mr. 
Lewis Baumer provides the excellent illustrations. Mrs. 



Molesworth's books require no praise from us at this 
time. They deserve the uniformly high reputation 
given them, being simple, unaffected, and interesting. 
" Chums" (Estes) comes as a surprise, being from the 
hand of the late Maria Louise Pool. It is a school story 
to begin with, and a story of country life to end with, 
being unconventional and sprightly throughout. Mr. 
L. J. Bridgman furnishes the wash drawings which 
emphasize the text. Mrs. Josephine Dodge Daskam 
writes a helpful and pleasant book of tales, calling it 
" Sister's Vocation, and Other Girls' Stories " (Scrib- 
ner). The interests in its pages are varied, as such 
titles as A College Girl " and " A Taste of Bohemia " 

indicate " The Girls of Bonnie Castle " (Jacobs) is 

a summer and winter book by Miss Izola L. Forrester, 
with pictures by Miss Anna Weatherbey Parry. Chi- 
cago and the West make their appearance here, as well 
as the East of America "Esther in Maine" (Jen- 
nings & Pye) tells of some half-grown children who 
have a good time under certain slight disadvantages 
and contrive to keep their elders employed at the same 
time. The book is simple and wholesome. Miss 
Amy E. Blanchard contributes to the more sedate joys 
of the holiday season with " Dimple Dallas " (Jacobs), 
an account of a mild-mannered little girl with a passion 
for being good. Miss Ida Waugh has made the draw- 
ings for the book, which resembles its numerous pre- 
decessors from the same hand. Kentucky, that land 
of lovely women and consequential men, is the special 
discovery of Mrs. Annie Fellows-Johnson, who uses it 
to good advantage in "The Little Colonel's House 
Party " (Page), illustrated by Mr. Louis Meynell. The 
"little colonel" is both a colonelet and a coloneless, 
and a bright little American girl in the bargain. Bears, 
soft Southern accents, darkies, and local color make 
the book both unusual and attractive. From the same 
hand, but with pictures by Miss Etheldred B. Barry, 
comes " The Story of Dago " (Page), " Dago " being a 
little monkey, fascinating to read about, as these small 
cousins of ours always are. Mrs. Fellows-Johnson 
carries him through some most laughable adventures, 
in one of which he stops an express train by swinging 
on the bell rope. With well-worn plots, the two stories 
which make up " Old Lady and Young Laddie " (James 
H. West Co.) have undoubted pertinence at this time, 
and inculcate the best of morals. They are by Mrs. 
Kate Whiting Patch, with pictures by Miss Bertha G. 

Davidson Those who recall " The Prince of the Pin 

Elves," by Mr. Charles Lee Sleight, will be glad to read 
a continuation of the story from the same hand, with 
numerous illustrations by Miss Alice S. Butler. The 
same Harry who was so honored in the Pin Country 
now goes visiting among " The Water People " (Page), 
this time with his little sister Helen, and wonderful 

things happen in consequence " For his Country " 

(Page) is the pathetic little story of a small boy in 
France who is more than ordinarily homesick for the 
United States. Mr. Marshall Saunders includes an- 
other short story, "Grandmother and the Crow," in 
the same volume, pictures for both being provided by 
Mr. Louis Meynell. 

Picture* and The connecting of the spheres of little girl- 
storiesfor hood with babyhood is accomplished in a 
little readen. delightful work by the author of " Eliza- 
beth and her German Garden," whomsoever, noble 
or royal, the author may chance to be. It is en- 
titled "The April Baby's Book of Tunes, with the 
Story of How They Came to be Written" (Macmillan),

and the colored pictures by Miss Kate Greenaway show 
three girls of assorted sizes, two with light hair and one 
with dark hair. Mother Goose, perennial well-spring 
of wholesome mirth, is the foundation for the book, 
which is worth anyone's while to read. Tunes are pro- 
vided, music and all, and if our children cannot all be 
Miss Greenaway's kind of children, they can all read 

what they said and did and sang An ingenious and 

profitable work is labelled, somewhat extensively, " The 
Home of Santa Glaus, a Story of Leslie Gordon's 
Visit to Father Christmas, and of the Strange Sights 
he Beheld in the Town of Toys " (Cassell). It is an 
original book, especially in respect of its illustrations, 
which are reproduced from Mr. Arthur Ulyett's photo- 
graphs. Mr. George A. Best tells the story of the dolls 
and other toys which make up the subordinate charac- 
ters of the narrative, and their likenesses are used in a 
novel manner for the pictures. As a welcome sequel 
to the favorite " Arabella and Araminta " stories, Miss 
Gertrude Smith .has provided " The Roggie and Reggie 
Stories " (Harper), and the successful pictures of the 
previous work are made new for this by Mr. E. Mars 
and Miss M. H. Squire, all in color. Arabella and 
Araminta appear in the narrative, but not in the illus- 
trations, and the ensemble is admirable " The Jungle 
School ; or, Dr. Jibber-jabber Burchall's Academy " 
(Cassell) is by Mr. S. H. Hamer, the drawings by Mr. 
Harry B. Neilson, two ingenious and witty gentlemen 
who will be recalled as the inventors of " Micky Magee's 
Menagerie" a year or two ago. The eminent pedagogue 
at the head of this institute of learning looks mightily 
like a dog, and his pupils for all the world like monkeys, 
tigers, and their cousins and aunts, though the life is 
that of the conventional English boarding-school, con- 
siderably jollified. Miss Margaret Johnson both writes 
and illustrates What Did the Black Cat Do? Guess! " 
(Estes), the hand lettering being in her well-known 
manner, with pictures of things introduced instead of 
the names of them. It may be added that the Black 
Cat does almost everything, from losing a pair of spec- 
tacles to putting his feet in the ink Mr. S. H. Hamer 
writes the text of " Animal Land for Little People " 
(Cassell), the numerous pictures being half-tone repro- 
ductions of beasts in the London Zoological Gardens, 
which give the work an air of undoubted authenticity. 
A miscellany of pictures, rhymes, and prose is to be 
found in " Bo- Peep, a Treasury for the Little Ones " 
(Cassell). Some of the drawings are as funny as they 
can be, one concerning a boy, a cow, and a camera be- 
ing especially noteworthy. But the greatest of all the 
collections for small boys and girls will be found again 
in " The Little Folks' Illustrated Annual " (Estes), for 
which the cleverest productions of many pens and pen- 
cils have been selected, with great good taste and entire 
good nature E. Nesbit has written a most delight- 
ful addition to unnatural history, a sumptuous book 
illustrated by Mr. H. R. Millar, with a number of 
decorated pages by Mr. H. Granville Fell. The re- 
sult is given the name of "The Book of Dragons" 
(Harper), and contains eight chapters, each dealing 
with certain interesting episodes in the life-history of 
one particular dragon. Some of these beasts are wild 
and some quite domestic in their personal habits, de- 
pending to a marked degree on the sort of example set 
them by the numerous small girls of the stories, who 
are, or ought to be, their betters. It is an undiluted 
pleasure to announce a re- issue of Mr. Walter Crane's 
large series of picture books issued by Mr. John Lane, 



the color printing and engraving by Mr. Edmund 
Evans. " The Frog Prince," " The Hind in the Wood," 
and " Beauty and the Beast " are at hand, with all 
their wealth of color and detail. Apart from the his- 
toric value of the text the pictures are sufficiently dec- 
orative to be used on the nursery walls by lovers of 
life and beauty. 

Favorite There remain for mention a few good old 

author* in books made new by the ingenuity of wri- 
newform. i^rs, artists, or publishers, giving a new 
lease of life to favorites which have long proved 
themselves superior to the sharpest tooth of time. Not 
the least ingenious of these is a clever adaptation of 
JEsop by Mr. James J. Mora, which he calls "The 
Animals of ^Esop " (Estes). Mr. Mora is best known 
as an artist, and his innumerable sketches, scattered 
through the text and margins, do nothing to belie his 
excellent reputation in that regard. But in addition to 
all this, he has modified and modernized the ancient 
fables in quite the spirit of the original, leaving a book 
which will amuse at the same time that it impresses 
the good old lessons of the lapsing ages. Judge 
Edward Abbott Parry has returned to an earlier man- 
ner in his rendering of " Don Quixote of the Mancha " 
(John Lane), leaving the broader humor of his " Butter- 
scotia" for an adaptation of John Shelton's famous 
translation. Mr. Walter Crane makes the drawings 
for the sumptuous work, which, though it contains 
hardly a tithe of Cervantes's history, is excellently 
done, once the audacity of it has been condoned. Of 
less daring, perhaps because the text is in a more 
archaic English, is Miss Mary Macleod's " Book of 
King Arthur and His Noble Knights " (E. & J. B. 
Young & Co.), with a careful introduction by Mr. 
John W. Hales, and numerous illustrations by the 
sculptor, Mr. A. G. Walker. The stories are taken 
bodily from Sir Thomas Malory, and the introduction 
rejoices in a biographical account of that gentle knight, 
made possible by Professor Kittredge's recent investi- 
gations and discoveries. The book is a joy to those 
who have the love of the Round Table in their hearts, 
and will answer for large children as well as small. 
" Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights " (Macmillan) 
contains most of the prime favorites of that glowing 
work, including accounts of such important function- 
aries as AH Baba, Aladdin, Prince Camaralzaman, the 
King of Persia, and the Princess of the Sea. Twelve 
pictures by Mr. T. H. Robinson, the frontispiece in 
color, make the little book a delight. With Mr. 
George Ludington Weed's " Life of St. John for the 
Young " (Jacobs), a companion to last year's life of 
St. Paul, both of them pious and carefully-executed 
works, the reviewer of children's books wishes his 
readers a very merry new century. 



MR. A. B. HINDS has undertaken a new translation 
of Vasari's "Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and 
Architects " for the " Temple Classics " (Macmillan). 
The edition will comprise eight volumes, three of 
which are now ready. Other recent issues in the same 
series include the second and third volumes of Macau- 
lay's Essays ; the second volume of Mr. F. S. Ellis's 
interesting adaptation of " The Romance of the Rose"; 
the sixth volume in Caxton's version of " The Golden 
Legend"; and a one- volume edition of Mrs. Gaskell's 
"Cranford," with a frontispiece portrait of the author 
which is as charming as the story itself.

NOTES. 



The Macmillan Co. have published Irving's "Sketch 
Book " in their school series of " Pocket English 
Classics." 

Mr. H. W. Mabie's " Norse Stories Retold from the 
Eddas," now nearly twenty years old, is published in a 
second edition by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 

" Inductive Lessons in Rhetoric," by Miss Frances 
W. Lewis, accompanied by a " teacher's manual " in 
pamphlet form, is a recent publication of Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. 

A new and cheaper edition of Mr. Howard Crosby 
Butler's interesting work on " Scotland's Ruined Ab- 
beys," first' issued last year, has been published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish " One Thousand Prob- 
lems in Physics," by Messrs. William H. Snyder and 
Irving O. Palmer. As a labor-saving manual for 
teachers, this little book is of distinct value. 

The exclusive rights for the publication of the 
French text of M. Rostand's "L'Aiglon" in the 
United States have been secured by Messrs. Bren- 
tano's, who will issue the work immediately. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. announce for immedi- 
ate publication a book by the Rev. Stopford A. Brooke, 
entitled " Religion in Literature and Religion in Life." 
The same firm will also issue at once a new book of 
verses by Sir Lewis Morris. 

" Studies of Plant Life," published by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co., is a manual of elementary exercises for 
classes in botany, the joint work of three experienced 
teachers, Messrs. Herman S. Pepoon, Walter R. 
Mitchell, and Fred B. Maxwell. 

Macaulay's essays on Addison and Milton, and 
Milton's " Minor Poems," all edited by Mr. Arthur P. 
Walker, constitute three volumes of the series of 
English Classics " published by Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co., and now issued in a new dress. 

A new translation of Flaubert's " Salammbo," made 
by Madame Zenaide A. Ragozin, has been published 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, in their series entitled 
" Tales of the Heroic Ages." The volume is illustrated, 
historically rather than imaginatively. 

"International Law," by Mr. F. E. Smith, is a 
" Temple Primer " (Macmillan) that ought to be found 
useful by a great many readers in these days of wars 
and rumors of wars, of diplomatic tension and the 
benevolent assimilation of inferior peoples. 

" Botany: An Elementary Text for Schools," by Mr. 
L. H. Bailey, is the latest work of that prolific and 
authoritative author, and is published by the Macmillan 
Co. It is a school book of the modern methods, and 
is noticeable for the beauty of its many illustrations. 

The latest additions to the attractive pictorial sou- 
venirs of popular actors and actresses of the day pub- 
lished by Mr. R. H. Russell are devoted to Mr. John 
Drew as " Richard Carvel," Miss Annie Russell in " A 
Royal Family," and Miss Maude Adams in " L'Aiglon." 
W T e have received several new numbers in the series 
of " Home and School Classics " published by Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co. Notable among these pamphlet 
texts are the abridged Shakespearian plays edited by 
Mrs. Sarah Willard Hiestand. Large type and simple 
illustrations make these texts very attractive. " Gul- 
liver's Travels," edited by Mr. Thomas M. Balliet, 



make up two other numbers of the series, and two 
others still are Raskin's " King of the Golden River," 
edited by Professor M. V. O'Shea, and Lamb's " Ad- 
ventures of Ulysses," edited by Professor W. P. Trent. 

The Messrs. Putnam are the publishers of a " Knick- 
erbocker Literature Series," intended for school use as 
supplementary reading matter, and the initial volume 
is an abridgement of Mr. Theodore Roosevelt's " Win- 
ning of the West," the editing done by Mr. Frank 
Lincoln Olmsted. 

Having undertaken to prepare the papers of Chief 
Justice Salmon P. Chase for publication by the Histor- 
ical Manuscripts Commission of the American His- 
torical Association, Mr. Herbert Friedenwald would 
be glad to hear from all persons having original Chase 
papers in their possession. He may be addressed at 
1300 Locust St., Philadelphia. 

An interesting reprint of an unique book originally 
issued in the early part of the century will shortly be 
published by Messrs. Truslove, Hanson & Comba. The 
work is from the pen of James Puckle, N.P., and bears 
the lengthy title, " The Club; or, A Grey Cap for a 
Green Head: Moral Maxims, Advice, and Cautions, in 
a Dialogue betwe'en a Father and Son." The reprint 
will contain an Introduction by Mr. Austin Dobson, 
and will be illustrated with fifty wood-cuts from de- 
signs by Thurston. 

" The Day's Work Series " is a collection of small 
volumes published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. Thir- 
teen volumes have just been sent us, of which the fol- 
lowing may be named as typical of the whole: "The 
Strength of Being Clean," by President D. S. Jordan; 
" Why Go to Church ? " by Dr. Lyman Abbott; "Our 
Common Christianity," by Dean Stanley; and " The 
Wisdom of Washington," selected by James Parton. 
The other volumes range all the way from Emerson to 
Bok in their authorship and their weightiness. 

Christmas week will witness the usual gatherings of 
the scientific societies, and the chief places of interest 
this year will be Detroit and Philadelphia. The Amer- 
ican Economic Association is to meet in the former 
city, while the latter will be the meeting-place of the 
Archfeological Institute, the Philological Association, 
the JSlodern Language Association, the Oriental Soci- 
ety, and the Folk Lore Society. The programmes 
prepared for these meetings are of great interest, and 
should attract a large attendance in both cities. 

In the death of Professor Burke Aaron Hinsdale, of 
the University of Michigan, THE DIAL, has lost one of 
its most valued contributors, and American historical 
scholarship one of its leading representatives. Pro- 
fessor Hinsdale was born in Ohio, March 31, 1837, 
and his career was a striking illustration of the way in 
which intellectual force can make itself felt when de- 
prived of the ordinary technical training. Although 
he did not have the advantages of a college education, 
he became president of a college at the age of thirty- 
three, and occupied this post from 1870 to 1882. He 
left Hiram College to become superintendent of the 
Cleveland schools from 1882 to 1886. In 1888 he 
began his connection with the University of Michigan, 
his chair being that of pedagogy. He was the author 
of " The Old Northwest," " The American Govern- 
ment," " How to Study and Teach History," " Teach- 
ing the Language Arts," and many other books in his 
chosen fields of history and pedagogy. He died on the 
29th of November, at Atlanta, Georgia.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



In NATURE'S 
REALM 

By DR. CHARLES C. ABBOTT, 

Author of "Upland and Meadoiv,' 1 '' "Notes 
of the Night," "Outings at Odd Times," etc. 
ILLUSTRATED BY OLIVER KEMP. 
With a photogravure frontispiece and ninety drawings, 
8vo, hand-sewed, broad margins, extra superfine, dull- 
surfaced, pure cotton-fibre paper, deckle edges, gilt top, 
and picture-cover in three tints and gold ; 309 pp., fully 
indexed. Price, #2.50 NET. 

PRESS NOTICES. 

He writes delightfully. Courant (Hartford). 

An artistic work. . . . Delightful . . . instructive. Constitution 
(Atlanta). 

A book to be treasured. Serenely philosophical, keenly observ- 
ant, intellectually suggestive, the placid marshalling of the less 
obvious facts of nature, with their gentle spiritual interpretation from 
Dr. Abbott's pen to make us all human together, is a real triumph of 
literature. The Dial (Chicago). 

It is a delight equally bo the outward eye and " that inward eye 
which is the bliss of solitude. " Herald (Taunton). 

The great thing about his essays and sketches on his rambling 
excursions is their unfailing charm. Herald (Boston). 

He is in close touch with Nature. He is acquainted with her varying 
moods. Spy (Worcester). 

A beautiful book that will delight every lover of Nature in its quiet 
haunts. . . . The book is an educator in its best meaning to old and 
young alike. Inter Ocean (Chicago). 

Dr. Abbott has long held an honored place among the few true 
lovers of nature whom she has blessed with the gift of telling to others 
the secrets she betrays only to her votaries, the delights she gives 
freely to those who will search for them diligently, with eyes to see 
and ears to hear. . . . These studies gain by a second reading, and a 
third, as does their reader. The illustrator must be in close touch 
with Nature himself; he certainly is with his author, the charm of 
whose text he interprets with rare felicity. Mail and Express (N.Y.) 

Not long ago, in reviewing Mr. Wishart's important history of 
" Monks and Monasteries," The Times had occasion to speak of the 
dignified form which had been Riven to the book by a new publisher, 
Albert Brandt, of Trenton. Prom the Brandt press we have now 
another noteworthy volume, presenting the work of a familiar author, 
but presenting it with a richness of external form it has not had 
before. This is " In Nature's Kealm," by Dr. Charles C. Abbott. All 
readers are familiar with Dr. Abbott's sympathetic nature studies. 
He is one of those men, like White of Selborne, who do not need to 
go far afield to find matter to interest them ; to whom the woods and 
meadows, the streams and the skies of their own vicinage are unfailing 
sources of delight ; who know the signs of the seasons and their myriad 
manipulations of animal and vegetable life, and who can describe 
what they see, not merely with scientific accuracy, but with poetic 
appreciation. . . . The dainty vignettes and marginal illustrations 
which decorate the fine broad pages are the work of Oliver Kemp, who 
is to be credited also with the fascinating cover design. . . . Mr. Brandt 
has presented his neighbor's work in a form of which it is altogether 
worthy, and has made a book that will attract attention by its beauty. 
Times (Philadelphia), 



A SHORT HISTORY OF 

MONKS 

& MONASTERIES 

By ALFRED WESLEY WISHART, 

Sometime Fellow in Church History in The University of 
Chicago. With four photogravures, 8vo, hand-sewed,, 
laid-antique pure cotton-fibre paper, broad margins,, 
deckle edges, gilt top, 454 pages, fully indexed. Price, 
$3.50 NET. 

PRESS NOTICES. 

Remarkably comprehensive and accurate, and, best of all, interest- 
ing. Home Journal (New York). 

Fascinating. Newi Tribune (Detroit). 

Splendid. Sunday Herald (Rochester). 

A narrative of absorbing interest. Argonaut (San Francisco). 

Will not fail to attract wide attention and interest. Mail and 
Empire (Toronto). 

When James Anthony Froude undertook to write the History of 
the Saints he encountered the same obstacles that Alfred Wesley 
Wishart met in writing his excellent work, "Monks and Monasteries."' 
There were unlimited materials from which to draw, but without suf- 
ficient authenticity to justify the record to be made up from them. 
The late professor of history at Oxford gave up the task as a vain one, 
but Mr. Wishart has pursued his to a successful conclusion, and hav- 
ing winnowed the grain from its disproportionate quantity of chaff, 
presents us with a volume for which students and general readers 
must alike feel grateful. He has sifted his authorities so carefully 
that the book has the stamp of truth in every statement placed there, 
however so deftly, that the literary grace of the work is fully and 
delightfully preserved. Scholarly without being pedantic, earnest 
and careful without showing either prejudice or partisanship, he 
sweeps the great field which his title includes, with a strength and 
evenness that give the book the hall-mark of sterling worth. His con- 
clusions are drawn upon no hypothetical grounds, and if modestly pre- 
sented do not lack the convincing qualities which Mr. Wishart so- 
plainly sees and so effectively puts into view. Times (Philadelphia). 

A valuable contribution to the voluminous historical literature of 
the Catholic church. Picayune (New Orleans). 

It emphatically ought to take rank among the favorite volumes in 
the libraries of students of the middle ages. North American 
(Philadelphia). 

The author has performed his gigantic task ably, . . . admirably, 
showing the true balance and the attractive impartiality of the true- 
historian. Journal (Boston). 

Thoroughly interesting and thoroughly trustworthy. . . . We 
heartily commend the work. McMaster University Monthly (Toronto), 

A work of equal erudition and elegance. Tribune (Chicago). 

A captivating theme. ... A well-told tale. . . . Vivid and clear. 
. . . The writer is to be praised for the impartial spirit he exhibits. . . . 
The volume proclaims the student qualities of the author. His schol- 
arship is lighted up with a clear and discriminating literary style. 
Times (New York). 

Comprehensive and scholarly . . . direct and lucid. Express 
(Buffalo).

THE LIVING AGE 






A Weekly Magazine of Contemporary Literature and Thought. 
A Necessity to Every Reader of Intelligence and Literary Taste. 

EACH WEEKLY NUMBER CONTAINS SIXTY-FOUR PAGES, 

In which are given, without abridgment, the most interesting and important contributions to the periodicals of 
Great Britain and the Continent, from the weighty articles in the quarterlies to the light literary and social 
essays of the weekly literary and political journals. Science, Politics, Biography, Art, Travel, Public 
Affairs, Literary Criticism, and all other departments of knowledge and discussion which interest intelligent 
readers, are represented in its pages. 

"THE SIEGE OF THE LEGATIONS." 

THE LIVING AGE began, in its issue for November 17, and continued for four successive numbers, a thrilling: account 
of "The Siege of the Legations," written by Dr. Morrison, the well-known correspondent of the London Times, at 
Peking. This narrative is of absorbing interest in its descriptions of the daily life of the besieged legationers, and it is note- 
worthy also as containing some disclosures relating to the inside history of what went on at Peking in those stirring days, 
which are altogether new and of the utmost importance. The unusual length of Dr. Morrison's narrative has precluded and 
probably will preclude any other publication of it on this side of the Atlantic. In England it has attracted wide 
notice. 

Published WEEKLY at $6.00 a year, postpaid. Single numbers, 15 cents each. 

MOMTHQ Until the edition is exhausted, there will be sent to 
mum 1 IIP. each new sub8Criber for 1901> on reque8 t, the num. 

bers of THE LIVING AGE from October 1 to December 31, 1900. These numbers contain The Siege 
of the Legations, as above, Heinrich Seidel's attractive serial, The Treasure, and the opening chapters of 
A Parisian Household, by Paul Bourget. These serials are copyrighted by THE LIVING AGE, and 
will appear only in this magazine.

In this book Miss Rayner follows her great successes in the field 

of historical romances of the colonial period with an even greater 

and more thrilling novel of Southern life twenty-five years ago. 

The New York Press says : " It is a tale of life, of full, strong,

of real people." 



"A MASTERPIECE OF REALISM." 

QUICKSAND. 

By Hervey White, Author of "Differences." 12mo. Cloth, 

decorative. 328 pages $1.50 

A Powerful Novel of Everyday Life in the Great West. 

Not merely the story of an individual, but the life history of a 
family. The kindly and faithful hired man, the quiet father, the 
energetic mother, the brother and sisters, all are drawn with infinite 
detail and astonishing vividness and realism. 

The Boston Transcript said of Mr. White's first book, "Differ- 
ences " : " It resembles strongly the work of the best Russian nove- 
lists. I have never before read any such treatment in the English 
language of the life and thought of laboring people." 

"QUICKSAND" SURPASSES "DIFFERENCES."
