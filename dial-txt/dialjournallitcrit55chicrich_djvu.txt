1913] THE DIAL 



NEALE'S FOR JULY 

BESIDES the regular departments, The Fraternity of the Fields, which is intended to be 
the eyes and ears of him who may not be with Nature in her many moods, conducted by an 
eminent writer; The Stage, a department of brilliant, trenchant, fearless criticism of plays, actors, 
and dramatists, conducted by a distinguished critic; Letters to the Editors, in which correspond- 
ents discuss among themselves topics of interest; In Motley, a department of wit and humor, not 
mere jokes, but pointedness, directed chiefly at persons in the limelight, besides these regular 
departments, with the new volume, which begins with the July number, 

A New Department 

will be established, an editorial department, in which all sorts of subjects will be treated, now 
seriously, now lightly, yet always vigorously, fearlessly, and independently. 

Five Great Serials Now Running 

These serials, "The Devil's Discharge," a novel by Col. Willard French; "The Strategy of 
Robert E. Lee," a critical military study, by J. J. Bowen; "The Persian Tassel," a detective story, 
by Olivia Smith Cornelius, and the political papers of Professor William Estabrook Chancellor 
will all be continued in the July number. 

OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES OF NEALE'S FOR JULY 

Feminism By Mowry Saben 

Mr. Saben, whose editorial articles in the "Boston Transcript," the "Louisville Courier-Journal," 
the "Detroit Free Press," and other newspapers have attracted widespread attention, writes of the 
ladies and their movement most entertainingly, and altogether fearlessly. 

William Waldorf Aster's Short Story 

The Phantom Square 

Head of the Astor family, formerly American Minister to Italy, proprietor of the "Pall Mall Gazette" 
and the "London Observer," still Mr. Astor has found time to make valuable contributions to 
literature. For years two of his novels have been widely read. But he has written nothing else so 
notable as this short story. 

Ambassador Page's Book Attacked 

Miss Elizabeth H. Hancock, a Virginian, and Miss Lily Young Cohen, a South Carolinian, assistant 
editors of NEALE'S MONTHLY, writing in collaboration, vigorously attack Ambassador Page's novel, 
entitled "The Southerner," which purports to be the autobiography of one Nicholas Worth. 
"May Mr. Page," they ask, "still say, in view of this book, that he is a Southerner? Why should 
he ever have thought himself fit to criticise Southerners and their institutions?" 

Katharine Lee Bates 

contributes her greatest poem to NEALE'S MONTHLY for July. Several pages will be devoted to it. 
There are but a few great patriotic poems in existence. Miss Bates, who is Professor of English 
Literature, Wellesley College, and a poet of distinction, has written a great American anthem in her 

America the Dream 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every 
number contains more than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain 
less than 128 pages. In its mechanical appointments no magazine in existence is its superior. 

Union Square The Neale Publishing Company New York 



THE DIAL, [July 1,1913 



A New and Important Work by 
Professor Josiah Royce 

The Problem of Christianity 

By JOSIAH ROYCE, D.Sc. (Oxford), LL.D., Litt.D. 

Profettor of the History of Philosophy, Harvard University 
In Two Volumes. Cloth Covert. $3.50 net. 

Volume I. The Christian Doctrine of Life 

Volume II. The Real World and the Christian Ideas 

"Nothing that Josiah Royce writes lacks interest, and everything that he writes is a 
challenge to high thinking and good citizenship. His two-volume work on 'The Problem 
of Christianity' comes from the press charged with the best kind of social stimulus. It 
presents, as he claims for it, ' a religion free from superstition '; it may even be held 
'capable of furnishing a foundation for a defensible form of metaphysical idealism.' Its 
sustained and magnificently elaborated insistence on the social factors of religion qualifies 
it for the praise which is sooner or later meted out to all needed work that is well done." 
Boston Herald. 

"The ripe fruit of a long process of keen, patient thought. A sincerely sympathetic 
but rigorously disciplined attempt to adapt to the uses of honest investigators of the 
function, extent, and acceptability of the Christian religion, the finest tools of thought 
in its most highly developed estate. His latest book is a triumph of scholarship's message 
for the multitude : in a noble sense popular." New York Sun. 



OTHER WORKS BY DR. JOSIAH ROYCE

" Sets clearly before the American people the need for aiming at the highest ethical ideals in their 
intercourse with one another and in their relations with the outside world." The Outlook.

points in his conception of national life and character. Cloth, fl.25 net

A PAGE OF ANCIENT HISTORY. 

On Washington's Birthday, 1887, James 
Russell Lowell came to Chicago, upon the invi- 
tation of the Union League Club, to deliver an 
address at the exercises held by the Club in 
celebration of that anniversary. The outcome 
of the affair was so unexpected, and its conse- 
quences so humiliating, both to Mr. Lowell's 
friends and to those who cherish the fair fame 
of this city, that it seems desirable to put on 
record certain accounts, hitherto unpublished, 
of what happened. These accounts ' place the 
matter in a light very different from that cast 
on it either by the newspaper reports or by 
the gossip current at the time. Mr. Browne, 
the editor of this journal, felt the thing very 
deeply, and the following publication properly 
belongs with the rest of the reminiscent mate- 
rial that we have printed since his lamented 
death. Unwitting of what was to follow, Mr. 
Browne wrote an article, in the manner of "A 
Fable for Critics," which appeared on the 
editorial page of the morning edition of the 
Chicago " Daily News " the day of Mr. Lowell's 
arrival in town. 

A GREETING TO LOWELL. 

We welcome to-day a visitor who, though but 
brief is his stay in our western metropolis, yet 
should receive such a greeting as to make him re- 
luctant to leave. A sincere, unobtrusive, unforced 
hospitality will no doubt please him more than too 
great prodigality of attentions, or keeping too much 
on the go, or making too great an exertion to show 
how " unique " the career of our wonderful city, 
which is still in its infancy (more is the pity). Do n't 
pile up statistics the schooners and brigs that enter 
our port, or the number of pigs and of cattle and 
other brutes killed in a year ; and especially let us 
keep in the rear those two-legged animals who make 
their jaw go incessantly braying in praise of Chicago. 
Spare our guest the details of our startling chronol- 
ogy, and stand as we are, without brag or apology. 
He will find a community, though hard at work, not 
engaging en masse in the packing of pork; with 
even a few, here and there, who 've inferred there 
are some things in life that are better than lard. We 
shall find him but who in our midst does not know 
him ? If such creature exists, fetch him out, let 
us show him. No one but a dense and confirmed 
ignoramus could deny that he knew of an author so 
famous. Or even if literature set its bar sinister on 
him, he would know our distinguished ex-minister

THE DIAI,

he who, at the fashionable court of St. James, moved, 
a gentleman born, with the squires and the dames; 
and while it was not to his taste to geologize among 
buried scores, yet he did not apologize for the plain 
words he 'd said when our hearts were all full of 
wrath and of bitterness toward John Bull. With 
the whole human race have his sympathies ever 
ran, yet he 's first and foremost of all an American ; 
and while his survey is as wide as creation he keeps 
in his foreground the great Yankee nation. For his 
country his genius rose highest and glowed in his 
" Crisis " and " Washers " and memorial " Ode." 
These poems flashed out like a fire in the dark, and 
went straight to our hearts as a ball to its mark. 
In prose or in verse how he makes words effectual, 
what a vigor he has this athlete intellectual ! Then 
how charming his fancy, how brilliant his jest, how 
flashing his wit, in his quips what a zest ! How 
delicious his humor ! may the moment come slow 
when we cease to admire dear old Hosea Biglow. 
As poet and patriot, critic and scholar, his career 
stands as full and as round as a dollar ; and clearly, 
of all those now living who grace American letters, 
he holds the first place. Nulli secundus, there always 
will show well among our best names that of JAMES 
RUSSELL LOWELL. May each year that passes more 
lightly assess him, and the prayer of our hearts will 
be ever " GOD bless him ! " 

When Mr. Lowell substituted, for the polit- 
ical discourse that he had expected to deliver, 
the delightful paper on Shakespearean criticism 
which may now be read in his "Latest Literary 
Essays and Addresses," his audience was con- 
siderably taken aback, and gave vent to its 
disappointment in language that must have 
been the occasion of much regret to those who 
were guilty of it. The newspapers took the 
matter up in a sensational way, and for the 
next few days Mr. Lowell was made the victim 
of much coarse abuse from press and public. 
The obvious explanation that he had simply 
acted like a gentleman was completely lost sight 
of in the comment that followed. He himself 
felt the matter keenly, and meeting Mr. Browne 
soon after the address, said to him: "I hope 
you will put me right with the public." 

Shortly after the address, Mr. Browne held 
a consultation with two of his friends, the up- 
shot of which was that the two articles which 
are now printed for the first time were pre- 
pared. The first of them, written by Mr. 
Browne, was intended for use in THE DIAL, but 
circumstances which need not here be explained 
prevented its appearance. It now follows ex- 
actly as then written. 

MR. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL'S recent visit to 
Chicago was an event scarcely inferior in interest to 
the visit of Mr. Matthew Arnold three years ago. Its 
most important incident was of course the address on 



Shakespeare, delivered by Mr. Lowell in Music Hall 
on the afternoon of February 22. This discourse, 
while perhaps less brilliant and polished than the 
addresses on Gray and Wordsworth given with such 
success in England, was yet worthy of Mr. Lowell's 
high rank as a scholar and critical essayist. Its 
main thesis was the extra-Shakespearean origin of 
the play of " Richard III.," but it touched many of 
the aspects of Shakespeare's genius and abounded 
in those felicitous phrases and stimulating thoughts 
which come so readily from Mr. Lowell, especially 
when dealing with a congenial literary theme. In 
its delivery he labored under the disadvantage of an 
almost painfully unsympathetic and unresponsive 
audience. It was not such an audience as would 
ordinarily have gathered in Chicago to hear Mr. 
Lowell on a purely literary topic. His subject had 
been announced as " American Politics." The au- 
dience, which was a large one, had come to attend 
a patriotic celebration of Washington's birthday. 
The fact that the lecture was delivered in the after- 
noon of a patriotic holiday, and other incidents, 
strongly confirmed this idea. Hence the surprise 
and disappointment when the announcement was 
made, by Mr. Lowell himself, of a change of subject. 
His explanation was, in effect, that when he had 
first been invited to speak in Chicago he had been 
offered a choice of two themes, a literary and a 
political one ; that he had chosen the latter, and 
prepared an address accordingly ; but that since 
reaching Chicago and becoming informed of all the 
circumstances, he found that he u stood on very 
delicate ground." He had, he said, always been in 
the habit, when speaking on public questions, of 
speaking his mind frankly; and if on this occasion 
he spoke on a political subject he felt that he must 
either not speak with entire frankness or risk being 
discourteous to those whose guest and to some ex- 
tent whose mouthpiece he was, and thus perhaps 
" mar a cordiality of welcome which will be among 
the pleasantest recollections of my life." It is ap- 
parent that Mr. Lowell felt himself surprised in a 
position where, if he went on, he must either be 
disingenuous or rude ; and he preferred to take the 
responsibility of withdrawing from the position, by 
changing the subject of his address. His motive in 
this, and the delicate sense of honor which actuated 
him, are such as every gentleman must respect. He 
may have underestimated the disappointment he 
would cause his audience, and have overestimated 
the interest his substituted topic would have for 
them ; but it ought not to 'be difficult to understand 
and appreciate his feelings and situation in the 
matter. It is well known that Mr. Lowell was in- 
vited to Chicago by the Union League Club, whose 
guest he was, and by whom the proposed patriotic 
celebration was managed. What he probably did 
not know until he reached Chicago is that, while 
the Club is not a political organization, yet its 
membership is composed largely in fact, almost 
entirely of pronounced Republicans. Mr. Lowell 
had prepared his address on politics evidently with- 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



out knowledge of this fact. The nature of his in- 
tended address we can to some extent infer, not only 
from our previous knowledge of Mr. Lowell, but 
from some of his utterances while in this city. At 
the Harvard dinner, two days later than his Music 
Hall address, and where he felt free to express 
himself " with entire frankness " on politics, he 
said : " We are told that we should not stand out- 
side of party. I have stood outside of all parties for 
twenty-five years. . . . What I wish is that good 
sensible men, and honest men, should act together 
on certain points, and stand outside of all parties 
until they accomplish those points. . . . Party organi- 
zation is no doubt a very convenient thing, but a great 
many people feel, and I feel very strongly with them, 
that when loyalty to party means disloyalty to coun- 
try, and means what it seems to me is still worse, 
disloyalty to conscience, it is asking more than any 
good man or citizen should concede." It cannot be 
doubted that such sentiments as these would be re- 
garded as highly offensive when delivered before a 
club most of whose members sincerely believe that 
loyalty to party is a political virtue; and the fact 
that the speaker was the guest, and, as he said, " in 
a certain sense, the mouthpiece," of the club, would 
certainly not lessen the displeasure. It is not hard 
to see why Mr. Lowell felt the necessity of a change 
of subject ; although it is certainly to be regretted, 
for the sake of all concerned, that the change could 
not have been decided on before the subject of the 
lecture had been so publicly announced. We do not 
precisely know on whom the responsibility belongs 
for the suppression of the intended change of subject 
until the very moment of the lecture. Mr. Lowell, 
in his introductory remarks, generously assumed all 
blame for the awkward situation ; and he has since 
maintained a proper and dignified silence. 

The other article, written by one of Mr. 
Browne's most intimate associates, was intended 
to be sent to an Eastern journal for publication, 
but this also failed of the use for which it was 
prepared. The present word of explanation 
is given to account for the evident difference 
of longitude assumed in behalf of those who 
might read it. Although never published, it 
was in the hands of Mr. Scudder, Lowell's 
official biographer, when he wrote of the Chicago 
episode, and enabled him to give his account the 
right coloring. 

THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LITERATURE AND 

PATRIOTISM IN CHICAGO. 

The great pork and grain centre of the country 
has just undergone a convulsion consequent upon 
the failure of a patriotic revival projected for the 
22nd of February. The Union League Club of 
Chicago, with the purpose of fitly celebrating 
Washington's birthday, arranged for public exer- 
cises in the Music Hall, and invited Mr. James 
Russell Lowell to deliver an address. The club also 
tendered Mr. Lowell a banquet upon the evening of 



the same day. " American Politics " was announced 
to be the subject of Mr. Lowell's address, and at 
the appointed hour the house was filled to its utmost 
capacity. The audience that had assembled to hear 
the distinguished speaker was not a little surprised 
when he rose and announced that he had changed 
his subject and would speak, not upon "American 
Politics," but upon the principles of literary criticism 
as illustrated by Shakespeare's "Richard III." In 
explanation of this change of theme, he said, in effect, 
that in announcing "politics" as the subject of his 
address he had not fully realized the conditions under 
which it was to be delivered ; that he was accustomed 
to speak frankly, and that here, speaking in some 
sort as the representative of the Union League Club, 
he feared that if he were to speak on the subject of 
politics he might give offence to his hearers, and that 
for this reason he had ventured to make the change. 
Having given this explanation, Mr. Lowell proceeded 
to read what appears to have been a most delightful 
essay in the higher criticism, one of those brilliant 
and scholarly efforts, full of delicate suggestion and 
cultured allusion, which are familiar to all of his 
readers. 

The true inwardness of the situation in which Mr. 
Lowell was placed is obvious enough to those who 
are familiar with the character of the organization 
under whose auspices he spoke. The Union League 
Club of Chicago is very similar to the club of that 
name in New York; it is a stalwart Republican 
organization, the term "Republican" being under- 
stood to indicate that the club is a bulwark for the 
support of Mr. Blaine and whatever political prin- 
ciples he may choose to represent. The club has 
succeeded in "freezing out" a few obnoxious mug- 
wumps developed by the crisis of 1884, and is prac- 
tically unanimous in its political creed. The extent 
to which it carries its political zeal may be well illus- 
trated by one or two minor episodes of the Lowell 
affair. Among the distinguished guests invited to 
the banquet, the mayor of Chicago, who, whatever 
he may be politically, is socially unexceptionable, 
was not included; and a numerous faction among 
the committee on arrangements displayed their rudi- 
mentary notions of politeness by seeking to exclude 
also from the banquet Mr. Lowell's Chicago host, 
who suffered under the reproach of being a notorious 
mugwump. With these facts in view, the delicacy 
of Mr. Lowell's action in changing the subject of 
his address is sufficiently evident. His own political 
opinions are too well known to require to be specifi- 
cally contrasted with those of the club at whose in- 
vitation he came to Chicago. What he might have 
said, had he spoken upon politics, may perhaps be 
inferred from some remarks which he made at the 
Harvard Club banquet, two days afterwards. "I 
stood outside of party for nearly twenty-five years 
and I was perfectly happy, I assure you. . . . Party 
organization, no doubt, is a very convenient thing, 
but a great many people, and I feel very strongly 
with them, feel that when loyalty to party means 
disloyalty to country, and means, what seems to me

THE DIAL 



[July 1 



is still worse, disloyalty to conscience, it is then ask- 
ing more than any good man or any good citizen 
ought to concede." Everyone knows the horror in 
which the Blaine men hold such sentiments as these, 
and we may well imagine the consternation with 
which the Union League Club would have listened 
to their orator had he expounded these damnable 
heresies. 

But owing, perhaps, to a too dim realization of 
what they had escaped, and, certainly, to an inabil- 
ity to appreciate the delicate instinct that prompted 
Mr. Lowell in making the change, his hearers were 
not only dissatisfied, but did not hesitate to express 
their dissatisfaction. The mute reproach of the 
large numbers who left their seats and silently stole 
away during the delivery of the address was fol- 
lowed by audible reproaches at the close, on the 
part of those who had remained, and to these the 
newspapers supplied a chorus on the next day. 
Some of the comments reported are very amusing. 
" He can't come this sort of a sell on us again," 
was the elegant remark of one member of the Club, 
as he sadly left the hall. Another auditor, a 
clergyman, was heard to say, "This is the first day 
I wished Bill Shakespeare had never been born." 
Another expressed his regret at the time wasted, 
exclaiming : u The idea of a man spending two hours 
trying to prove that Shakespeare didn't write Henry 
VIII." Still another was reported as saying that 
"the speaker was a great man on politics, but who 
was Richard III ? " When one of the committee on 
arrangements tersely remarked : " It was a pretty 
hard grind on the Club," he expressed very neatly 
the prevailing sentiment of the audience. 

Not less amusing than these random comments 
are the various theories put forward to account for 
Mr. Lowell's change of subject. The obvious 
explanation which we have already given requires 
for its acceptance some degree of refinement of 
feeling, and this seems to be lacking in many of his 
critics. The simplest of the theories propounded is 
that Mr. Lowell was "full" upon the occasion of 
the address. Another almost as simple is that he 
lacked "sand." A third has it that Mr. Lowell is 
a presidential candidate and does not wish to injure 
his chances of success by being too outspoken on 
political subjects. This finds a number of adherents. 
A fourth theory is that he was dissuaded from ex- 
pressing himself on politics by secret emissaries of 
Mr. Blaine. Still another ingenious theorist sug- 
gests that Mr. Lowell's modesty prevented him from 
speaking upon a subject of which he is notoriously 
ignorant. "What does he know about politics ? He 
never made a stump speech in his life !" Two other 
theories of conflicting character find each a certain 
number of upholders. One of them is, in effect, 
that Mr. Lowell came to the conclusion that Chicago 
was not capable of appreciating a profound treat- 
ment of politics, and that he chose literature as 
something more nearly upon the level of his pro- 
spective audience. This theory was expressed by 
the gentleman who is reported to have said : " He 



thought anything good enough for Chicago." The 
opposing theory, which is far more popular, is based 
upon a finer perception of the relative demands of 
politics and literature upon the intelligence of an 
audience. According to this theory, Mr. Lowell 
had prepared a political address suited to what he 
supposed to be the limited capacity of a Chicago 
audience. When he reached that city, however, the 
evidences of culture and refinement which met 
him on every hand revealed to him the extent of his 
misconception, and he hastily substituted something 
better suited to the exacting standard of his hearers. 
This theory has the great advantage of having no 
offensive implications as far as Chicago is concerned, 
and of leaving Mr. Lowell under the reproach of all 
Chicagoans for his want of faith in the greatness of 
their city. The most amusing feature of the whole 
matter is found in the unanimity with which it is 
agreed that Mr. Lowell " missed the greatest oppor- 
tunity of his life " when he abandoned the treatment 
of patriotism for that of literature. However diverse 
are the reasons brought forward to account for the 
fact, there is but the one conclusion that in doing 
this he made in the words of the poet whom he 
has lovingly expounded to so many classes of Har- 
vard students u il gran rifiuto" "the great 
refusal" of his life. The newspapers, which refer 
to him sometimes as Mr. Lowell, and sometimes as 
"Mr. Russell," are particularly strong upon this 
point. "He misjudged the importance of his 
opportunity," says one of them. "Not until he set 
foot in Chicago did he realize that here in the ' far 
West 'of his youth, was the great heart of the nation, 
which only wanted the touch of a master hand to 
awaken to the measure of its responsibilities in 
American politics." That he missed " the greatest 
opportunity of his life " is the general verdict, the 
implication being the very modest one that the 
audience which it was his privilege to address was 
better worth speaking to than any with which his 
public career had previously brought him face to 
face. 

Upon the occasion of the banquet tendered Mr. 
Lowell the evening of the same day, much care was 
taken to make him realize that he had failed to 
meet the expectations entertained of him by the 
Union League Club. The president of the club, in 
his introductory remarks, made it evident that he 
regarded Mr. Lowell's excuse as a flimsy one, and 
said, amid the cheers of his auditors : " This club is 
not organized for the purpose of keeping silent. As 
American citizens, we need have no fear here or at 
any time of expressing our honest opinions." Thus 
reassured, Mr. Lowell spoke at considerable length 
upon the subject of " Practical Politics." But what 
he said was evidently not quite up to the club 
standard of " patriotism," and so a genuine " patriot " 
from the river bottoms of the Sangamon valley, Mr. 
Jehu Baker, was introduced to succeed him. This 
distinguished statesman said, according to the news- 
paper report of his remarks, that " he did not care 
a continental for English customs, or for those who 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



aped those customs in this country. We had a 
literature which was purely American, and did not 
need to go abroad for our scholars or our books." 
This was evidently the article of "patriotism" for 
which the listeners had been waiting, and the 
applause which followed no longer partook of the 
perfunctory, but was, we read, genuine and pro- 
longed. 

The events of Mr. Lowell's visit to Chicago afford 
a fresh illustration of the peculiar fatality which 
seems to follow the eminent men of letters who 
occasionally find their way to that city. When Mr. 
Bret Harte was there twelve or fifteen years ago, 
a reception was arranged for him, and it went off 
successfully in every respect but one the distin- 
guished guest himself failed to put in an appearance. 
Some people accounted for this by the fact that the 
invitation did not include his host. When Lord 
Coleridge was entertained at a large dinner-party 
by a well-known Chicagoan, the harmony of the oc- 
casion was marred by an attachment of the dinner 
itself in satisfaction of a claim against the entertainer. 
When Mr. Matthew Arnold went to Chicago, he 
was received with feelings of ill-concealed hostility, 
and the publication, not long thereafter, of a letter 
hastily assumed to have been written by him, was 
gladly seized upon as a warrant for the removal of 
all concealment, and Chicago said without reserve 
what it had thought of its guest all the time. Mr. 
Lowell is the latest victim of the arrogant philistin- 
ism which seems to inhere in the very nature of the 
prosperous but crude community on the shore of 
Lake Michigan. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

FICTION AND DIPLOMACY would seem to be not 
very distantly related to each other if we understand 
in its double sense the " merry definition of an 
ambassador" which, says Sir Henry Wotton in a 
letter to Velser, "I had chanced to set down at my 
friend's, Mr. Christopher Fleckamore, in his Album." 
The definition, as will be recalled, was this: "An 
ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad 
for the commonwealth." Of American novelists 
who in an official capacity have juggled with the 
truth at foreign courts, the list is not long. In 
fact, only two foreign ministers, Bayard Taylor and 
Mr. Arthur Sherburne Hardy, come to mind at this 
moment as combining the two characters of story- 
writer and minister plenipotentiary; and Taylor, 
though he produced four creditable novels, is ranked 
rather with the poets than with the writers of prose 
fiction. Washington Irving wrote some things 
" Knickerbocker's History of New York," for in- 
stance that contained more fiction than fact; but 
even the most elastic definition of a novelist fails to 
include him in that category. The consular service, 
however, has engaged the talents of several em- 
inent writers of pure fiction, notably Nathaniel 
Hawthorne during the administration of the presi- 



dent whose biography he prepared. Charles Lever, 
among British novelists, filled consular positions. 
But now we have, in the appointment of Mr. Thomas 
Nelson Page as ambassador to Italy, and of Mr. 
Meredith Nicholson as minister to Portugal, two 
notable additions to the little company of diplomat- 
novelists. The author of "Marse Chan," "In Ole 
Virginia," "On Newfound River," "Red Rock," 
" Gordon Keith, "and many other deservedly popular 
works of fiction, is in the full maturity of his powers, 
having been born in 1853, in the "Old Dominion" 
that has served as the scene of so many of his 
stories* Three terms at the Washington and Lee 
University, with a subsequent course of law at 
the University of Virginia, seem to have completed 
his formal education; and he holds the degrees 
of Litt.D. and LL.D. from both Southern and 
Northern universities. His abandonment of the law 
for letters came only after eighteen years of legal 
practice in Richmond, during a part of which time 
he followed the two professions simultaneously. He 
is a member of the American Academy of Arts and 
Letters. Mr. Nicholson, the popular Indiana novel- 
ist, known especially for his " House of a Thousand 
Candles," "The Lords of High Decision," and "The 
Siege of the Seven Suitors," has also issued at least 
two volumes of poems and has tried his pen in 
serious prose, as in "The Hoosiers" (in "National 
Studies in American Letters"). Born at Craw- 
fordsville in 1866, he was educated at the public 
schools of Indianapolis, holds honorary degrees from 
Wabash College and Rutter College, and is a mem- 
ber of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. 

INDIA'S FIRST LIBRARY SCHOOL is about to be 
started, if it is not already started, at Baroda 
College. The principal of that college, Mr. A. B. 
Clarke, in a recent address before the Baroda 
Library Club, now printed in the Baroda "Library 
Miscellany," said: "I propose and my proposal 
will go out to Government for orders very shortly 
I propose to start in the College a Post-Graduate 
course in Library Science. I imagine that we are 
probably about to see a great development of libra- 
ries throughout India, very largely as a result of 
the work begun under His Highness' direction 
here. No University or College in this country, so 
far as I am aware, has yet made any steps in pre- 
paration for this coming need, and I suggest as a 
subject for profitable consideration that here in 
Baroda we should recognize this force, compara- 
tively new to Indian life, by the institution of a 
two years' course in Library Science in the Baroda 
College. We are well situated to undertake this 
work, for we have an expert in classification and 
library methods, who would doubtless gladly give his 
services ; we have at our disposal also the whole of 
the College staff to lecture on the subjects which may 
be selected as appropriate to the course." Confidence 
is expressed in the future demand for library-school 
graduates to take charge of "the various libraries 
we may expect to see arising in different parts of

this country." The foregoing mention of "His 
Highness" refers to the Maharaja Sayaji Rao 
Gaikwad, leader in the present free-library move- 
ment in India; and the "expert in classification and 
library methods " we infer to be Mr. W. A. Borden, 
formerly active in library work in this country, and 
now Director of State Libraries in Baroda. The 
"Library Miscellany," first and at present only 
journal of its kind in India, is now approaching the 
end of its first year, and has doubled in size since 
its starting. It contains an unexpected richness of 
varied matter, all having to do with library work 
and progress at home and abroad; and it continues 
its heroic undertaking of printing its matter in three 
languages, English, Gujarati, and Marathi. It 
is also well illustrated. That so considerable and 
necessarily expensive a library journal should be 
able to maintain itself in a country where the 
modern public library is in its infancy is cause for 

surprise and congratulation. 



EDUCATIONAL VALUES are not often expressed, 
or indeed expressible, in terms of dollars and cents. 
But the Northwestern University statisticians have 
of late been busy computing the worth in money of 
a higher education. For this purpose a census was 
taken of the class of 1903, which has had nearly ten 
years to get shaken down and to realize the per- 
manent value of things acquired at college. For 
the first five years after graduation the average 
earning power was eight hundred and sixty-seven 
dollars, and for the next five eighteen hundred and 
sixty-two. The national Census Bureau gives the 
average yearly income of the Chicago salaried man 
as twelve hundred and two dollars. Subtract this 
latter amount from eighteen hundred and sixty-two, 
and multiply the remainder by forty (a fair estimate 
of a man's years of productive activity after he 
attains to full earning capacity), and the result is 
something over twenty-six thousand dollars. Deduct 
from this the cost of a four-years course at college, 
computed at twenty-four hundred dollars for the 
Northwestern curriculum, and we have as the net 
value of the sheepskin handed out to the young 
graduate on commencement day, twenty-four thou- 
sand dollars, or let us say, not to shave the figure 
too closely, twenty-five thousand. That is a very 
pretty arithmetical performance, and the result 
arrived at ought to cheer the worldly-ambitious 
collegian, present or prospective. But there are not 
a few young men who, naturally acquisitive of 
material possessions, find their aims and ideals so 
raised to a higher plane by a college course that 
they themselves are rendered much less efficient as 
money-making machines. And are not those who 
succeed in preparing for and completing a college 
or university education the very ones who, as a rule, 
would in any case be victors in the battle of life? 
The bachelor of arts sometimes succeeds as a bread- 
winner, not because of, but in spite of, his academic 
equipment. Thus, after all, the problem is not so 
simple as it looks. 



SIR JAMES MATTHEW BABRIE, BART., enjoys the 
distinction, as his friends and admirers claim, of 
being the first man of letters since Scott to receive 
the baronetcy. Scribbling knights are as plentiful as 
plums, but to win the higher grade with the pen is 
a distinction indeed. The honor is in this instance 
as well deserved as it was unexpected and unsought, 
Mr. Barrie (or Sir James, we should say) being 
among the most modest and un-selfseeking of mor- 
tals. A London correspondent of the New York 
" Evening Post" calls attention, in this connection, 
to the autobiographic value of " When a Man's 
Single," especially in the unabridged form in which 
that cheerful narrative originally appeared in " The 
British Weekly." The author, it is asserted, is a 
composite of two of his characters, Rob Angus, 
the youth who leaves a Thrums sawmill to accept 
the position of reporter on the Silchester " Daily 
Mirror," and afterward courts success or failure as 
a free-lance in London, and J. Noble Simms, an 
experienced metropolitan journalist whose counsel 
proves helpful to the young man from the country. 
Silchester of course stands for Nottingham, where 
the future creator of Thrums and its picturesque 
characters was for two years, after leaving Edin- 
burgh University, on the staff of a daily paper. 
That the above-named book is rich in autobiographic 
material is thought to be at least partly proved by 
the reported utterance of Sir William Robertson 
Nicoll (editor of "The British Weekly ") concerning 
young Mr. Barrie as he first knew him : " You never 
caught him reading ; he did not buy papers, and yet 
in some mysterious way he knew everything." That, 
as may be recalled, is a good description, as far as 
it goes, of J. Noble Simms. Intending writers for 
the press are advised by the authority here quoted 
to make a serious study of " When a Man's Single." 
Such a study is certainly likely to prove remunera- 
tive in diversion even if not in useful advice, and 
the probability is that it will be profitable in both. 



" CREATIVE " LIBRARY WORK is what all earnest 
library workers naturally wish to engage in, and do 
engage in to the extent of their aptitudes and 
opportunities. At the St. Joseph (Mo.) Public 
Library there has been established a new depart- 
ment, called the Creative Department, of which the 
librarian, Mr. Charles E. Rush, says in his current 
Annual Report: "The need of an assistant to devote 
full time to the various methods of securing larger 
numbers of readers and to promote the reading of 
better literature on the part of those enrolled as 
patrons resulted in the establishment of the ' Creative 
Department.' This department was given immediate 
supervision of the compiling of reading lists, news- 
paper stories, printed Library publicity, bulletins, 
picture collections, and special exhibitions." Of the 
library's illustrated circular addressed to school- 
children, of which mention has already been made 
by us, it is reported that " these circulars more than 
doubled the juvenile registration in one month, and 
also increased the adult registration." A further

activity of a " creative " nature has been the instal- 
lation of an Edison Home Kinetoscope, equipped 
for moving-picture films and stereopticon slides. 
This is especially for story-hour use at the branches, 
and it has proved a decided success with the children. 
It will be of interest to note that "the equipment 
includes moving-picture films of such titles as ' Little 
Red Riding Hood,' 'Hansel and Gretel,' 'The Child 
in the Forest,' and 'The Little Girl Who Did Not 
Believe in Santa Claus,' etc., and lantern slides 
showing ten pictures on each plate of interesting 
travel scenes and instructive geographical subjects. 
The remarkable features of the machine are its 
simplicity of construction and management, portable 
size, economy in purchase and maintenance cost, 
and the pleasing results obtained." Other features 
of Mr. Rush's Report, especially its novel and 
artistic form, appeal for notice; but our space is 
inexorably inelastic. ... 

THE FRENCH ACADEMY'S GRAND PRIZE FOR 
LITERATURE, awarded this year to M. Remain 
Holland, author of the ten-volume chronicle of the 
doings of Jean-Christophe a narrative that its 
numerous French admirers, and perhaps others also, 
would like to see extended to a hundred volumes 
has been well bestowed. A mind capable of con- 
ceiving and producing a work of so generous a scope 
must have an unusually wide range of interests and 
tastes and aptitudes. That it has such a range is 
evident, even to the inquirer who searches no 
further than the pages of "Who's Who," whence 
a few significant items may here be noted. Born 
January 29, 1866, at Clamecy, M. Rolland was 
educated at the college of his native town, at the 
Ecole Normale Supe*rieure in Paris, and at the 
French School in Rome. He has the academic 
degrees of agrege d'histoire and docteur es lettres, 
and has been professor of the history of art at the 
Ecole Normale Supe*rieure, and afterward at the 
Sorbonne, where he was the first to teach the history 
of music; he is a member of the "conseil de direc- 
tion de 1'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales." His 
published works include seven dramas, which need 
not here be named, biographies of Beethoven, 
Michael Angelo, and Tolstoy, a history of the opera 
in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti, books on 
musicians, early and modern, and the monumental 
"Jean-Christophe." His recreations are music and 
travel, and he has his abode, appropriately enough, 
on Mount Parnassus (162 Boulevard Montparnasse). 



A GREEK PARALLEL TO "THE PILGRIM'S PRO- 
GRESS," unsuspected by most lovers of that famous 
allegory, is pointed out by Mr. William E. A. Axon 
in a contribution to the New York " Evening Post." 
He first quotes from a letter written by Southey to 
Sir Egerton Brydges : " The paper upon Bunyan in 
the last Quarterly Review is by Sir Walter [Scott]. 
He has not observed, and I, when I wrote the 
' Life,' had forgotten, that the ' compleat design of a 



Pilgrim's Progress' is to be found in Lucian's 
4 Hermotimus.' " Quotation at some length is then 
made from this dialogue, in the translation of 
Messrs. H. W. and F. G. Fowler (Clarendon Press). 
Bunyan's Celestial City is, in Lucian, a sort of 
Utopian State, symbolizing virtue, and inspiring in 
those who hear about it a desire to become its citi- 
zens. As Lycinus says, in the course of the dia- 
logue: "In good truth, Hermotimus, we should 
devote all our efforts to this, and neglect everything 
else ; we need pay little heed to any claims of our 
earthly country; we should steel our hearts against 
the clingings and cryings of children or parents, if 
we have them ; it is well if we can induce them to 
go with us; but, if they will not or cannot, shake 
them off and march straight for the city of bliss, 
leaving your coat in their hands, if they lay hold of 
it to keep you back, in your hurry to get there ; what 
matter for a coat? You will be admitted without 
one. I remember hearing a description of it all once 
before from an old man who urged me to go there 
with him." Differences as well as resemblances 
occur, inevitably, in the two treatments of the theme, 
and it is obvious enough that the English allegorist 
had no knowledge of his forerunner; and, of course, 
however many writers before Bunyan may have had 
dreams and visions similar to his, and even if, as some 
have supposed, he got a few hints from Spenser's 
"Faerie Queene," or possibly from the legend, a 
favorite with him, of Sir Bevis of Southampton, 
nevertheless the honors of the Bedford preacher 
remain undiminished ; for 

"Though old the thought and oft exprest, 
'Tis his at last who says it best." 



A REMARKABLE GUIDE-BOOK, unknown to readers 
of Murray and Baedeker, but more genuinely useful 
than any of those familiar red volumes, is Mr. John 
Foster Carr's admirable " Guide to the United States 
for Immigrants." It was in his college days that 
Mr. Carr, tramping in his summer vacations through 
the sunny south of Europe, had planted within him 
the germs of what later developed into a large ca- 
pacity for understanding and helping the foreigner 
of lowly station on his arrival in this land of oppor- 
tunity and freedom. Of the Italian immigrant 
especially he learned to comprehend the needs and 
desires; and so it was for him first of all, and in 
his tongue, that the now famous " Guide " was pre- 
pared. Though specialists and experts were called 
upon to put their finishing touches to the various 
sections of this primer for prospective Americans, 
the simplicity of its style and plan remained unim- 
paired, and the readiness with which its lessons can 
be grasped by the humble reader is a constant source 
of delight to him and to all concerned. First pub- 
lished three years ago, the initial edition of three 
thousand copies was soon exhausted, and a second 
of ten thousand went the way of its predecessor. 
Translations, or adaptations, rather, in Yiddish and 
Polish were added, and found eager purchasers.

THE DIAL 



[July 1 



English versions of the Italian and the Yiddish 
manuals were prepared for Americans desirous of 
keeping themselves informed of what Mr. Carr is 
doing. The modest price of fifteen cents is charged 
for the book, in any of its several versions ; and as 
it is well-illustrated and otherwise well made, this 
price harely pays for its manufacture. To further 
its distribution, and thus to do something toward 
solving the immigration problem, a general invita- 
tion is extended to make the acquaintance of the 
" Guide," which can be had, postpaid, of Mr. John 
Foster Carr, 241 Fifth Avenue, New York. 

A POVERTY OF POETIC TERMS seems to be appre- 
hended by Mr. Edmund Gosse in the near future 
of the art of poetry. In a recent lecture on " The 
Future of English Poetry " he expressed himself, 
according to the London " Times," as foreseeing a 
dearth of adequately expressive and sufficiently 
unhackneyed language to meet the poet's need. 
" With the superabundant circulation of language 
year after year, week after week, the possibilities 
of freshness grow rarer and rarer. The obvious, 
simple, poignant things seem all to have been said." 
Such is the tone of Mr. Gosse's gloomy prognosti- 
cations, but one may, without being a fatuous optim- 
ist, refuse to share his fears. Some thousands of 
years ago it was written by one who chanced to find 
himself in what may have been not unlike Mr. 
Gosse's present state of mind: "Is there anything 
whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath 
been already of old time, which was before us." 
Just how the new bottles for the new wine will be 
provided, and exactly what form and fashion they 
will take, can never be predicted ; else they would 
not be new ; but a good case could be made out for 
the probability of greater freshness and richness in 
the vehicle of poetic thought in the future than in 
the past, if any such argument were needed to avert 
a panic among the poets. The necessity, however, 
does not exist. ... 

FURTHER FACTS CONCERNING THE WIDENER 
COLLECTION, which is ere long to find a suitable 
home in the new Harvard library building erected 
to his memory, are contributed to the current 
" Harvard Graduates' Magazine " by Dr. A. S. W. 
Rosenbach of Philadelphia. It appears, rich and 
rare as the collection has been found to be, its value 
will be still further enhanced by the addition of a 
* number of items from the second Huth sale for which 
Mr. Widener left bids with Mr. Quaritch before 
embarking on the ill-fated " Titanic "; and these 
orders are to be filled, under his mother's authority, 
as if he were still living. A pathetic story about 
the Bacon's "Essaies " (London, 1598) in Widener's 
possession is now told. A short time before the ship 
sank he put the little volume, of which only four or 
five copies are known to exist in that rare second 
edition, into his pocket, saying to his mother : 
" Mother, I have placed the volume in my pocket ; 
little ' Bacon ' goes with me." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE DATING OF BOOKS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Two or three months ago one of the best publishing 
firms in this country sent out for review a book bearing 
upon its title-page the date 1913. The title-page does 
not in any way indicate that it is a new edition or new 
impression, but turning over, we read " Copyright, 1908 

and 1909, by Copyright, 1911, by ." In the 

preface it is stated that the book is based on chapters 
contributed to two magazines, but that since their pub- 
lication in these, they have been revised and consider- 
ably enlarged. The copyright dates 1908 and 1909 
evidently refer to the magazine publications, but the 
meaning of the date 1911 is not clear without further 
enquiry. To be quite sure, I wrote direct to the pub- 
lishers for information, receiving this reply: 

" Answering your inquiry of April 12th, we would advise 

that we first published in November, 1911. The book 

has been re-issued since in the same form." 

I then wrote to the author, explaining what had been 
done, and asking if it had his approval. He replied 
under date of May 31: 

"I thank you for telling me what my publishers have 
done. I do not approve of it, and am forwarding your letter 
with a request that they do the proper thing in this matter." 

To-day I have a letter from the publishers, dated 
June 12, as follows: 

" Your letter to concerning has been referred 

to us for reply. We wish to state that the title pages of books 
are always changed to the date of the year in which that 
special edition has been printed, but the date on the copyright 
page remains the same, being the date when the book was 
first published." 

It is because the publishers appeal to common usage 
for their justification, that I think it may be worth while 
to discuss the practice described. Without making any 
minute or statistical enquiry, I think I am justified in 
saying that it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
determine from the title-page the true history of a book. 
In many cases new impressions are styled new editions, 
while in others their dates are those of the impression, 
with nothing on the title-page to indicate that they were 
published in an earlier year. There is, of course, the 
copyright date, given in small type over the page, but 
purchasers and even reviewers may not notice this. Can 
publishers say, with a perfectly clear conscience, that 
they do not expect or wish the public to be deceived by 
their method of dating ? T. D. A. COCKERELL.

Will you do me the favour to make it known among

raphy of the poet Keats, and that I shall be very

American collectors. With some of these gentlemen 
I have the pleasure of being already in communication, 
but there must be others who can help me in my purpose 
if they will, and it is to them that I now wish to make 
appeal through your columns. SIDNEY COLVIN.

THE HERO OF GETTYSBURG.* 

It is a commentary on the power of words 
that what Lincoln said at Gettysburg has 
eclipsed what Meade did there. To be bowled 
over by an eulogy celebrating your own per- 
formance is a hard fate. Of course such an 
effect can only be temporary. There is room 
in the gratitude of men both for the doer of a 
deed and the orator or prophet soul who ap- 
preciates it. Evidences are not wanting that 
General George Gordon Meade is coming into 
his own. 

He has at least been fortunate in his biog- 
raphers. The first was Colonel Bache, a cousin, 
who gave an admirable account of Meade's 
personality. The second was Mr. Pennypacker, 
whose careful military study of Meade's career, 
based on the War Records, has been accepted 
as authoritative both at home and abroad. The 
work now just published consists primarily of 
Meade's letters to his wife during the Mexican 
and Civil Wars. These are connected by a 
thread of biography supplied by his son, Colonel 
George Meade, with some additions by his 
grandson, George Gordon Meade, who edits the 
whole. This biographical matter is calm and 
clear in style, with no trace of partisanship or 
special pleading. In its simplicity and reserve, 
indeed, it foregoes opportunities for popular 
appeal. More than this, however, there are 
over two hundred pages of appendices, in which 
are given the correspondence between Meade 
and Halleck after Gettysburg, many newspaper 
articles attacking Meade, his testimony before 
the Congressional Committee on the Conduct of 
the War, and much other matter impugning 
or defending him. In addition, there is a set 
of twenty-four maps showing the positions of the 
Union and Confederate armies before, during, 
and after Gettysburg. 

Such boldness in editing we believe is un- 
paralleled in biography. It is as though General 
Meade's family had said to the public : " We 
want nothing but truth and justice. Here are 
all the materials for an opinion. Judge !" 

The entirely new part of this work lies of 
course in General Meade's letters to his wife. 
They are attractive and interesting, and reveal 

* THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF GEORGE GORDON MEADE,

Sons. 



a character fiery and firm, considerate and gen- 
tle. In the darkest hours he is not despondent, 
and in the brightest not too much elate. His 
judgment of men and measures is extraordi- 
narily just. In the thick of things, his views as 
to what should be done, both politically and in 
the field, are such as time has proved accurate. 
Towards the end his indignation at the treat- 
ment meted out to him occasionally breaks forth 
in strong words. "I don't believe the truth 
will ever be known," he wrote, "and I have a 
great contempt for History." These letters are 
rich material for a future historian. There are 
hundreds of incidents, and innumerable flashes 
of light upon important events, which can be 
found nowhere else. Of Meade's personal 
character and his relations to his family and 
friends it is unnecessary to speak. They were 
ideal. 

Yet there was a quality in him which worked 
against his success, a certain aloofness which 
probably caused the newspaper cabal against 
him and alienated the complete Sympathy of the 
public. For one thing, he was a trained soldier, 
and he had scant regard for people who took up 
soldiering without such training. His earliest 
letters from Mexico are filled with objurgations 
at the volunteers or irregulars. Yet when in 
the middle of that campaign the despised volun- 
teers won the victory of Buena Vista, he said it 
was the greatest feat of arms America had ever 
seen or will see. Similarly, the ink was hardly 
dry in the letters describing the hopeless char- 
acter of the recruits of the Pennsylvania Re- 
serves when they gave a good account of them- 
selves at Dranesville, winning the first victory 
of the war. Meade's views of the necessity of 
training and preparation for war were entirely 
right, but he never seemed to realize that the 
American volunteer soon becomes a veteran. 
Somebody asked Grant once how long it took 
to make an infantry soldier. " Oh, about half 
an hour," he said. Grant's trust in common 
humanity endeared him to the people, and when 
the critical moment came probably helped him 
to take precedence of Meade, though it is prob- 
able that he was not so brilliant a soldier, and 
it is at least doubtful whether his total sheaves 
of victory overtop Meade's in importance. 

If this touch of hauteur and professional pride 
must be scored against Meade, there is a vast 
account of injustice on the side of the country 
to be wiped out. Americans, indeed, may be 
said to have an hereditary instinct of injustice 
towards him. His father died broken-hearted 
at the failure of his Spanish claims under the 



14 



THE DIAL 



[July 1 



Treaty of Florida. The justice of these claims 
was admitted, and at different times bills for 
their payment passed both Houses of Congress. 
But the matter was not consummated then, and 
this really infamous robbery has been perpetu- 
ated to the present day. 

For fifty years Meade has been set aside, 
ignored, depreciated, even insulted. The man 
who saved the Union Army from disaster at 
Charles City, who swept the Confederates from 
South Mountain, who led the charge at Marye's 
Heights (the most splendid one of the war), who 
was promoted on the field of Antietam, who 
saved Grant from the consequences of his blun- 
der at the North Anna and Sheridan again and 
again, who fought the two battles which drove 
the Confederates into their lines at Richmond, 
has ever been doubted and decried. But of 
course his crowning triumph was Gettysburg. 
It was the greatest single thing done by any 
leader on either side during the war, the most 
important battle of the four years. The best 
military authorities are practically united in say- 
ing that if Gettysburg had been lost the cause 
of the North would have been doomed. 

Consider the conditions of the two leaders 
in that conflict. Lee, knowing of course his 
aim and purpose, his army well in hand, his 
troops flushed with two great victories and made 
more formidable by rumor, had been in long 
trusted command. Meade was suddenly sum- 
moned three days before the battle to take charge 
of the Union army. Its morale was more or 
less impaired by defeat; he hardly knew the 
positions of his widely scattered troops, and of 
course could not tell where the enemy would 
strike. Consider the marvellous concentration 
that preceded and followed the crushing in of 
his van and the death of his most brilliant 
captain in the first day's fight at Gettysburg. 
Consider the energy, the promptitude, the skill, 
with which he repaired the gallant but almost 
fatal error of Sickles's advance on the second, 
when, but for the support he gave, the army 
would have been cut in two and the Round Tops 
lost. Consider his prevision of the third day's 
fight. " They have tried our right, they have 
tried our left, and to-morrow they will attack 
our centre," he said. Consider how he met this 
probability, ranging line after line of troops at 
the threatened point, so if the Confederate col- 
umns had broken through the outer rim it would 
have been an avalanche swallowed up by an 
earthquake. Consider how he placed Gregg 
and his cavalry to cover his right. Wherever 
men or a leader were needed there they were 



set by the stern ruler of the day. Surely few 
battles have ever been fought which exhibited 
more divining and directing genius, more pre- 
vision, preparation, and personal daring than 
Meade put forth at Gettysburg. 

But, his critics have sung in chorus ever 
since, he did not make a counter attack. Well, 
flesh and blood are not quite iron and fire. 
Three days of tremendous marching, three days 
more of terrific fighting, would seem as much 
as could be expected from mere mortals. The 
Sixth Corps, which we are always told was fresh 
to the fight and could have been hurled upon 
Lee, did not exist as an entity. It had been 
broken up and scattered to different points of 
the line. Besides, the head of Meade's spear 
of battle, Reynolds, was shattered, its massy 
shaft, Hancock, broken. Gibbons, Sickles, and 
other generals were out of the combat. All 
Lee's great lieutenants were alive and ready for 
the fray. 

But why apologize for what was wisdom's 
very course? Anyone who knows the ground, 
who has realized the spirit of the Southern 
troops, who has read the lessons of Fredericks- 
burg and Cold Harbor, knows that an assault 
on Lee's position would have been repulsed with 
fearful slaughter. The Confederates' concave 
line was more defensible than the convex one 
of the Unionists, and its converging fire would 
have annihilated any columns Meade could have 
set in motion. It is surely a fair thing to com- 
pare Gettysburg with the Battle of the Wilder- 
ness. Meade's superiority in numbers has been 
questioned, at the most it was trifling. Grant 
had 125,000 to Lee's 70,000. After a long rest 
in winter quarters and then a leisurely day's 
march, Lee struck him in the tangled scrub oak 
thickets of the Wilderness. Two days of fight- 
ing ensued, terrific, but not worse than the first 
two days at Gettysburg. Then both armies 
accepted check. If Grant was a more deter- 
mined fighter than Meade, why did he not turn 
upon Lee then and there and overwhelm and 
smother him with his immense numerical superi- 
ority? He might have saved Spottsylvania, 
Cold Harbor, and Petersburg. Doubtless he 
did all that was humanly possible; but if we 
criticize Meade must we not also condemn 
Grant? 

Fame at last awards its wreaths to the worth- 
iest. Prejudice, clap-trap, partisan feeling are 
in vain. To the South, which was outnumbered 
two and a half to one in men and outweighed 
probably five times in resources, will finally go 
the larger share of the glory of the war. Lee,

in whose hand the South placed and kept its 
sword of command, will shine forth as the 
central figure of the strife. His audacities, his 
endurance, his resourcefulness, and his indom- 
itable battle spirit, were longer tried and more 
triumphant than those of any other leader. But 
in Meade, though the latter had no such range 
of opportunity, no such unfettered command, 
we believe that Lee met his match. They were 
the two best soldiers of the war, and it was a 
fate propitious to the Republic which set them 
opposed in the battle that saved the Union.

THIRTEENTH CENTURY POLITICS 
AND CULTURE.* 

Mr. Henry D. Sedgwick, already known as 
a sympathetic student of Italian life, has giveii 
us in his " Italy in the Thirteenth Century " a 
work of belles lettres rather than a formal his- 
tory. No learned footnotes mar the delight of 
browsing through pages bristling with poetical 
quotations, and all the dry material of chro- 
nology and bibliography is relegated to the 
appendix at the end of the second volume. 
And yet the work has an historical purpose, 
for, winding in and out among the details of 
Proven9al, Sicilian, Bolognese, and Tuscan 
poets, university professors, artists, and saints, 
is the story of the last great phase of mediaeval 
imperialism in State and Church. The impos- 
ing figure of Innocent III. ushers us in; the 
versatile Emperor Frederick II., stupor mundi, 
flits through the first volume ; while the pathetic 
Pope Boniface VIII., broken by the humiliation 
of Anagni, closes the panorama and marks the 
end of the middle ages. 

Little essays on politics, religion, literature, 
and art as found in thirteenth-century Italy 
form the substance of the two volumes. There 
are twenty-nine of these essays in the first vol- 
ume, each averaging twelve well-printed octavo 
pages, and twenty in the second volume, each 
about sixteen pages in length. Such short 
disconnected chapters are easy to read by them- 
selves and of themselves as special topics in the 
history of politics and culture. Thus in vol- 
ume one we have a chapter on Innocent III. 
as the Priest and as the Preacher, then one on 
Joachim the Prophet, followed by an essay on 

* ITALY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY. By Henry 
Dwight Sedgwick. In two volumes. Illustrated. Boston: 
Houghton Mifflin Co. 



Papal Jurisprudence and a culminating chap- 
ter on Innocent as Dominus Dominantium. 
From this group we pass to a chapter on St. 
Francis and another on his First Disciples, 
while the next two chapters or essays relate to 
Frederick II. and his relations with the Papacy. 
The field of religious and political history is 
then abandoned in favor of brief studies of 
Provencal and Sicilian poetry ; of the Lombard 
Communes; of Bologna, her Constitution, her 
University, and her University professors, espe- 
cially the merry Boncompagno, and their inter- 
ests ; of the Nobles of the North ; and of Art 
in its earlier development and its thirteenth- 
century applications. Only towards the end of 
the first volume do we get back to the Papacy 
and the Empire, with Innocent IV. excommu- 
nicating Frederick, and that " wonder of the 
world " bringing his meteoric career to a close by 
a death-bed marriage to the mother of Manfred. 
But we are asked to turn to Gothic architecture, 
the later history of the early Franciscans, and 
the disciples of Joachim before studying the last 
stand of the Italian Hohenstaufen. Essays on 
Tuscany and Florence close the first volume, 
which has thus presented a bewildering variety 
of content in its many brief chapters on politics, 
religion, and culture. 

The twenty chapters of the second volume 
are slightly longer and in general somewhat 
less topical than those of the first. Without 
attempting a detailed survey of the contents, it 
will be sufficient to say that there is one chap- 
ter on thirteenth-century manners and customs, 
two on the great theologians St. Thomas Aquinas 
and St. Bonaventura, three on Italian vernacular 
and Latin literature, three dealing with the city 
states and provinces, four in succession on sculp- 
ture and painting, six on Italian politics and 
the papacy, and an epilogue which attempts in 
five pages to give a synthesis and summary of 
what has been treated. 

Mr. Sedgwick brings to his task of descrip- 
tion and interpretation the enthusiasm of a lit- 
erary scholar rather than the organizing power 
and critical acumen of the scientific historian. 
His portrayal of Innocent III. is sympathetic 
and appreciative compared with the less enthu- 
siastic treatment accorded to Frederick II., who 
is depicted as " less a man ahead of his time 
than out of sympathy with it." In view of the 
remarkable constructive work of a governmental 
and legal character that Frederick undoubtedly 
accomplished in his Italian kingdom, it is diffi- 
cult to see how such a negative judgment can be 



16

[July 1 



sustained. Frederick was probably somewhat 
out of sympathy with his time, but he was in 
advance of it also, not in his imperial ideas and 
ambitions but in his viewpoint as to centralized 
government. Yet Mr. Sedgwick observes that 
" he looked back and not forward." Surely this 
is not true of the ablest and most interesting of 
the Hohenstaufen, save in so far as he was an 
imperialist. The truth is that Mr. Sedgwick is 
not convincing as an interpreter of mediaeval 
history, however entertaining and fluent he may 
show himself as a sympathetic commentator on 
thirteenth-century civilization. 

The treatment accorded St. Francis and his 
followers is scholarly and interesting, though 
lacking in unity. Similarly the account of 
Italian vernacular culture in its various stages 
of development is scattered through several 
chapters, interesting in themselves but more 
valuable historically if grouped together. Were 
the work as a whole arranged in sections having 
topical unity and development, it would be more 
readable and convincing as a study of mediaeval 
politics and culture. As it is, we must either 
skip from one chapter to another further on, 
making our own topical selection, or read a suc- 
cession of chapters with no more than numerical 
or slight chronological continuity. 

The value of a work such as this, though not 
great from the constructive historical viewpoint, 
is considerable. Information attractively pre- 
sented abounds in every chapter. The poli- 
ticians, churchmen, poets, and artists that made 
the thirteenth century so wonderful in history 
pass before us in brilliant procession. Their 
activities are described, their characters ara 
assessed, and their words quoted in a spirit of 
sympathy and appreciation. The English reader 
has the opportunity given him of coming in 
contact with great personalities of Church and 
State, with famous and romantic Italian cities 
and districts, and with the stirring new life of 
the Italian vernacular as it develops from the 
Provencal forms and the southern Italian or 
Sicilian dialect to the sweet mysticism of the 
dolce stil nuovo over which the young Dante 
raved so mightily. Many an eager young stu- 
dent with tenacious memory and enthusiasm for 
culture will find these volumes an Open Sesame 
to the varied life of Italy in what Renan calls 
le plus grand siecle du moyen age, while older 
and more experienced minds will pick and choose 
such topics as interest them and will find the 
treatment scholarly and sympathetic. This is 
particularly true of Innocent III., about whom 



there is so little of value in English; and also 
of Joachim of Calabria, whom Mr. Sedgwick 
characterizes as one who 

" Flew at the sacred text like Michelangelo at a block 
of marble, hacking, ciitting, chiselling, shaping, until he 
forced the cold material to set free the imprisoned truth 
within. He cared little or nothing about dates and 
times; his soul was swept along on the whirl of St. 
John's tremendous vision; he saw again the pale horse 
ridden by Death with hell following after, he saw the 
fearful beasts and the stars of heaven falling to earth 
as the fig tree casts her fruit; he felt the mighty mystic 
import of the end of one era and the beginning of another, 
and his soul flushed with expectation and passion." 

This remarkable religious enthusiast and prophet 
has been too little noticed by English writers in 
comparison with St. Francis and St. Dominic. 
He was in many ways a mediaeval prototype of 
Savonarola in his prophecies of disaster, though 
lacking the political power possessed by the 
great Florentine seer. 

Mr. Sedgwick's treatment of Italian culture 
is of particular interest and value on account of 
the many illustrative quotations he gives. This 
feature makes the half-dozen chapters devoted 
to the poets a veritable source book of thirteenth 
century vernacular literature. The extracts are 
admirably selected, and of sufficient length or 
completeness to furnish the reader with a com- 
parative idea of the progress of literary culture 
from Sordello to Dante. The original Italian 
usually precedes the English translation, afford- 
ing an opportunity for the linguist who may 
wish to criticise the translator. Popular and 
yet scholarly accounts of the various fine arts 
round out the cultural treatment, and emphasize 
the intimate relationship that existed in the later 
middle ages and early Renaissance between 
politics, religion, and culture. A sense of humor 
is present in many of the cultural chapters, and 
is especially apparent in the delightful little 
essay entitled "On Some University Profes- 
sors," as witness the following extract relating 
to the incomparable Boncompagno of Bologna : 

" Boncompagno's treatise, The Palm, which, so he 
says, enjoyed great success at the University and put 
his enemies to rout, seems to us as primitive as the 
paintings or sculpture of contemporary artists. It is a 
little book of some twenty pages, intended rather for 
teachers in the preparation of their lectures than for 
students ; it deals briefly with various matters in the art 
of writing: composition itself, prose, a grant of privilege, 
a testament, the parts of a letter, salutation, narra- 
tion, petition, conclusion, punctuation, minor clauses 
and parables. It reveals to us the difficulties that beset 
the men who dig the foundation of knowledge. 'I 
admit,' he says, ' that I do not know where the epis- 
tolary art was discovered. In Greece I was told that 
when the Israelites were under Pharaoh's yoke they 



1913]

did not dare speak to one another, and therefore Moses 
invented writing and communicated with them in that 
way. Others say that the art was invented in Noah's 
ark. I am wholly ignorant whether these explanations 
are true or false.' 

" His self-confidence and his love of humour, how- 
ever, enliven the book. He gives but one example of 
the proper form for beginning a letter : ' Suppose,' he 
says, that the Pope writes to the Emperor on one mat- 
ter or on several. If it is on one matter the writer may 
begin in this way : Since We are bound by our office to 
be assiduous in admonishing all the sons of the Church 
lest they be caught in the snares of earthly temptation, 
much more attentively We ought to counsel your 
Imperial Majesty by apostolic letters, so that you may 
pass through the things of this world in such a way as 
not to lose those of eternity, etc. But if in the same 
letter the Pope wishes to touch upon a second matter 
he may proceed thus: Moreover We commend most 
heartily to your Excellency our beloved son Doctor B., 
whom We and our brethren from an intimate knowledge 
of his piety and learning love most dearly, begging your 
Excellency that on account of our request you will treat 
him with every consideration and give a favourable 
answer to his requests.' To whom can he refer under 
this discreet initial ? " 

We are certainly under obligations to Mr. 
Sedgwick for the exploitation of this delightful 
character. 

Mr. Sedgwick's style is fluent, though a little 
flowery. It savors somewhat of an attempt at 
fine writing, but is easy to read and well suited 
to the descriptive work with which he chiefly 
occupies himself. A full-blown literary style is 
not out of place when literature and art in their 
interpretative aspects are being enthusiastically 
treated. There are, however, in some places 
naivetes of expression and commonplaces of 
quotation that jar on one in reading a work of 
seemingly selective character. But, on the 
whole, one cannot but admire the general liter- 
ary tone and quality of the work, and pronounce 
it a valuable addition to the library of any lover 
of books or student of culture. The lack of 
historical organization is a fault that may be 
remedied in another edition ; meanwhile we are 
the richer by the possession of new material 
in English on thirteenth-century politics and 
culture. 

Some thirty well selected photogravure illus- 
trations, together with a map of Italy, add to 
the general value of the work for reference and 
guidance. An excellent index is provided, and 
the typography and appearance of the volumes 
do credit to the publishers. Teachers giving 
college or university courses in mediaeval history 
will undoubtedly find these volumes a most 
welcome addition to the somewhat scanty 
material in English available for students' use.

LITERARY RELICS OF A BYGONE AGE.* 

In Miss Weston's new volume we have for 
the first time completely accessible in modern 
English "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," 
the most beautiful of all mediaeval English 
romances of chivalry; together with either 
pioneer translations or better translations than 
have hitherto existed of a number of other 
medieval poems "Arthur at Tarn Wadel- 
ing," " Cleanness," " Patience," the " Pearl," 
with parts of the " Morte Arthure," and of the 
" Vision of Piers the Plowman." Of these, 
the " Pearl " is an especially noteworthy vision- 
poem which deserves to be widely known. It 
has the distinction of style and the power of 
poetic imagery which one admires in "Sir 
Gawain and the Green Knight," and it is 
generally thought to be by the same unknown 
author. A partial translation in verse by Dr. 
Weir Mitchell (The Century Co., 1906) has 
already drawn some attention to this remarkable 
poem; but Miss Weston's version, besides being 
complete, succeeds far better in reproducing 
the spirit and atmosphere of the original. 

If faithfulness to general effect, rather than 
line-for-line accuracy at particular points, be 
the test of verse translation, it should be said 
at once that Miss Weston's versions of "Sir 
Gawain and the Green Knight " and the " Pearl " 
are splendidly successful. Miss Weston's 
general competence is assured by the long 
practice which she has had in translating from 
medieval languages. She translated Wolfram's 
"Parzival" into English verse in 1894, the 
greater part of "Sir Gawain and the Green 
Knight" into English prose in 1898, Gottfried's 
"Tristan " in 1899, four of the lais of Marie de 
France in 1900, and since then several other 
Old-French Arthurian stories. Doubtless in a 
second edition of her latest volume Miss Weston 
will polish and improve some careless phrases. 
It is hoped that she will also avoid the mistake 
of using, in a translation into modern English, 
words which are either obsolete or are employed 
in a meaning no longer understood. In a few 
places, by the use of such words, she has 
obscured the meaning of her lines. Two examples 
must suffice : 

" The very steed beneath the self-same semblance 
ware" (p. 10). 
" For tho' his weird be drear 
Each man that same must dree " (p. 26).

lines of "translation" will be qualified to under- 
stand the original Middle English. 

Miss Weston has done well to place her trans- 
lation of "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" 
first in her book, for it is sure to make the 
greatest appeal to the reader. It is a capital 
story, told with distinction of manner and ade- 
quate constructive skill. Sir Gawain is pictured 
as the Father of Courtesy, the beloved and 
almost perfect English knight of the fourteenth 
century. Ideals of conduct and those things 
which train, develop, and test the heart of a 
man are kept ever before us. We feel as we 
read that the class of society for which the poet 
wrote, and to which he doubtless belonged, took 
much thought for the spirit, how it should be 
strengthened and made noble. The intellectual 
weakness of such a society is plain. It was 
unwilling to entertain new ideas, except such 
as seemed likely to be of use to the soul. That 
the habit mediaeval men had of repressing every- 
thing new that seemed to them valueless for 
the soul was narrow and deadening, everyone 
knows. To-day the condition is reversed, no 
fear of injury to the soul deters anybody from 
giving welcome to a new idea, however dangerous 
it may appear. A new idea is likely to be sub- 
mitted to the test of a different kind of utility, 
utility to the body. If it will not help us to be 
clothed, warmed, and filled, we will have none 
of it. Our narrowness is different from that of 
the Middle Ages ; and some readers experience 
a delightful and perhaps useful change by look- 
ing back from the materialistic civilization of 
to-day to the ideal which English noblemen of 
the fourteenth century pictured for themselves. 
In romances of chivalry such as "Sir Gawain 
and the Green Knight" one gets at least a com- 
plete relief from the insistent utilitarianism of 
modern writing. The change in point of view 
may broaden our horizon; but perhaps, after 
all, it is wiser to say that we turn back to these 
old stories merely for mental play, merely to 
relax our spirits with the exhilarating thought 
that we are doing nothing useful. The increas- 
ing number of readers who enjoy these romances 
will feel an obligation to Miss Weston and to 
her publishers for making accessible in such 
charming form these relics of a bygone age.

A GREAT EDUCATIONAL, REFER- 
ENCE WORK.* 



Anyone who glances through the list of con- 
tributors to the new volumes of Professor 
Monroe's " Cyclopedia of Education " f will be 
impressed with the fact that the editor has 
induced many of the recognized educational 
authorities in this country and abroad to col- 
laborate with him in the production of this 
great work. The writers who have prepared the 
articles for these volumes are to-day playing the 
chief roles in determining educational theory 
and, to some extent, educational practice 
throughout the world. Usually much of the 
work in encyclopaedias is done by persons who 
are chiefly skilled in presenting in acceptable 
form the knowledge which others have devel- 
oped ; but it is precisely the other way around 
in respect to the volumes before us. This 
peculiarity is perhaps due to the fact that educa- 
tional subjects have not heretofore been pre- 
sented to any extent in encyclopaedic style, so 
that it has been necessary to call upon those 
who are actually shaping educational thought to 
furnish the contents of this work. 

Every article in these two new volumes is, 
in the opinion of the present reviewer, the work 
of a capable specialist ; and it is probable that 
what these writers have presented will command 
the respect and secure the attention of educa- 
tional workers in all countries. In assigning 
space to the various articles, primary importance 
has been given to those dealing with subjects 
of present-day interest ; and these should meet 
the needs of those persons who are actually 
engaged in the work of instruction. There are 
many articles in these volumes, of course, which 
will appeal primarily to the educational philos- 
opher, historian, and administrator ; but the in- 
terests of these groups are not made paramount. 

Some of the more important articles which 
bear directly upon the problems of the school 
are those on Geography ; Geology ; the educa- 
tional history and present practice of Germany, 
Italy, and Japan; the study and teaching of 
Greek, Latin, and English Grammar; high 
schools in the United States ; various topics on 
School Hygiene; a large number on Educa- 
tional Psychology; Household Arts in Educa-

tion; Industrial Education ; Infant Education ;

a number of American states ; Children's Litera- 
ture ; Manual Training ; Memory ; Methods of 
Teaching Modern Languages; Moral Educa- 
tion ; School Museums; Music in Education; and 
Play and Playgrounds. Besides these there are 
many other important articles on educational 
institutions, and the men who have contributed 
to the development of educational theory and 
practice. 

In the treatment of most of the topics, an 
excellent method has been followed. The history 
of the subject is first briefly presented, and then 
the best contemporary views are set forth. The 
present reviewer has been especially pleased 
with the fairness that has been observed in the 
presentation of debatable views and theories, 
as for instance, the status of Greek and Latin 
in the schools, and the proper method of teach- 
ing these subjects. The distinguished professors 
who have prepared these articles have not 
permitted their special interests unduly to 
influence their judgment regarding the relative 
value of these studies in modern education, and 
the efficiency of various methods of teaching 
them advocated by different people to-day. It 
is apparent throughout the volumes that careful 
editorial supervision has secured a fair-minded 
and judicial attitude in the discussion of subjects 
which are in the process of being clarified 
through experimentation and critical exami- 
nation. The "Cyclopedia" will be found of 
genuine service to students of education, prac- 
tical teachers, and laymen who wish to become 
informed regarding the best thought of to-day 
bearing upon the subjects considered. 

M. V. O'SHEA. 



SEVENTY-FIVE years ago Alfred Smith Barnes, at the 
age of twenty-one, founded at Hartford, Connecticut, 
the publishing house of A. S. Barnes & Co. (now the 
A. S. Barnes Company), which in 1840 removed to Phila- 
delphia, and five years later to New York, where it still 
flourishes. A short history of the house " Seventy-five 
Years of Book Publishing " is now issued in pamphlet 
form, with portraits of the founder of the firm and others 
of its members, facsimiles of early title-pages bearing 
its imprint, and some account of the educational and 
other works it has published. It is a record of consci- 
entious as well as able effort in the production and 
circulation of standard textbooks and, in later years, of 
a wider range of works. Since the acquisition, in 1906, 
of the educational publications of E. L. Kellogg & Co., 
the house has shown a tendency to return to the special 
field in which it first achieved success. Conservative 
plans are now under way for a considerable increase in 
the company's list of textbooks. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

There is always a danger in the cultivation of 
the garrulous, intimate, discursive style. Its prac- 
titioner is apt to become so enamoured of his own 
cleverness that his conceits will grow ever more 
fantastical, and his irrelevancies ever more discon- 
certing. It is given to few to drape the mantle 
of Thackeray about them in graceful folds. Mr. 
De Morgan adopted this perilous practice to such 
effect that from "Joseph Vance" on his novels grew 
steadily less readable, and he ended in a veritable 
super-subtle futility. We notice symptoms of the 
same tendency in the novel that Mr. Henry Sydnor 
Harrison has given us as a successor to the " Queed " 
of two years ago, and we regret it exceedingly. 
His manner has become irritatingly labored, and 
frequently one does not know what he is driving at 
until a page or a paragraph has been re-read and 
closely scrutinized. Not that "V. V.'s Eyes" is a 
bad novel, on the contrary, it is a very good one; 
only it is less good than "Queed," and this mainly 
because of the tendency of manner that we have 
above characterized. The scene is again (presum- 
ably) in Richmond, and again we have a study of 
a soul growing human before our eyes by the action 
of circumstance and environment. The story is 
complementary to " Queed " in that it deals with the 
expansion of a woman's soul instead of a man's, and 
also in that the evolutionary process leads it out of 
selfishness and frivolity rather than out of dryness 
and logical pedantry. The soul belongs to Carlisle 
Heth, who is brought up with the vain and empty 
ideals that prevail in that small fraction of a com- 
munity that calls itself " society," and who is brought 
to realize that a girl may have a nobler ambition 
than reigning in that petty sphere, and winning the 
desirable parti that is the goal of a " society " girl's 
ambition. Now Carlisle, with all her frivolity and 
petty self-satisfaction, has the glimmerings of a 
conscience, and this is aroused into activity by two 
agencies first, a lapse of conduct on her own part,

and, second, the influence of V. V.'s eyes, which 
penetrate her soul-recesses much as ROntgen rays 
penetrate the opaque tissues of the body. Her lapse 
of conduct is merely an expression of her moral 
cowardice, and seems too slight a matter upon which 
to hang the plot of the novel, and all the serious 
consequences that ensue. She has had a summer 
flirtation with a dissipated youth, and one day, when 
he is too drunk to know what he is doing, he swims 
out to the boat in which Carlisle is taking a solitary 
sail, climbs aboard, and frightens her with the vio- 
lence of his reproaches. Repulsed by her, he leaps 
overboard and swims back to shore. Meanwhile, a 
gust has upset the boat, and witnesses on the shore 
think that he knows of it, and has deliberately left 
the girl in danger to save himself. In consequence, 
he is ostracized, goes to Texas, gets drunker than 
ever, and finally commits suicide. Now Carlisle's 
dereliction is simply that she allows the story 
of the youth's assumed cowardice to spread when 
she might have corrected it, a not unnatural course 
of conduct for a selfish girl who dislikes being 
made the subject of gossip. The longer she lets the 
matter go, the more impossible it seems to say the 
words that would clear the boy's reputation, butwhen 
she learns of his death, she is self-convicted of guilt, 
and with her remorse comes a general spiritual 
awakening. Turning now to V. V., it becomes our 
function to say of him that he is a physician who 
works in the slums, and who gives the poor gratui- 
tous service. He is the soul of goodness, and his 
optimism is such that he cannot believe that any 
human being can continue to do wrong after his 
eyes have once been opened. He even applies this 
doctrine to Carlisle's father, who employs underpaid 
labor in his unsanitary cheroot works, and, although 
denouncing him from time to time, still expects 
that he will one day experience a change of heart. 
Between him and Carlisle there are several sharp 
passages at arms, and she tries hard not to like him, 
but there is something in his eyes that she cannot 
resist, and she is won over, despite herself, to his 
ideas and philanthropies. He becomes her con- 
science, until her own has grown strong enough to 
assert itself, and his influence leads her to make 
what tardy reparation she can for the death of the 
boy in Texas, to discard the wealthy and aristocratic 
suitor for whom she has successfully angled, to bring 
about the needed changes in the cheroot works, and 
to offer herself as a worker in V. V.'s pet project 
of a social settlement. The author quite wantonly 
kills V. V. just when Carlisle has learned to love 
him, and the fact that he gave his life for his fellow- 
man is small consolation either for her or for the 
reader, who has never been led to suspect so tragic 
an outcome, for the. story. Some of the minor char- 
acters are quite delightful, especially the slum child 
Corinne, a "buncher" in the cheroot works, who 
wants to be a lady and know about "netiquette," 
and who worships V. V. as an incarnation of Pro- 
vidence. She is as appealingly pathetic as any 
figure in the gallery of Dickens, and is perhaps the 



figure that will linger longest in our memory from 
the pages of this book. 

The old moral that the objects for which most 
men strive with all their energies become, when 
achieved, dust and ashes in the mouth, is once more 
read for us in "The Ambition of Mark Truitt," by 
Mr. Henry Russell Miller. The hero, who leaves 
the country town which has reared him to plunge 
into the life of the great industrial city, is deter- 
mined to carve out for himself a successful career, 
and sets somewhat ruthlessly about it. His aim is 
empery in the kingdom of steel, and he begins as a 
common laborer in the mills. With industry, he 
combines foresight and a capacity for leadership 
which soon make him a marked man, so we find him 
climbing rapidly up the hill of fortune. He works 
upon the devil-take-the-hindmost principle which 
spells success under the conditions of our competitive 
civilization, and becomes a wealthy captain of in- 
dustry before the book is half written. The rest of 
the story tells us how he finally saves his soul, 
which has seemed irrecoverably lost. For one thing, 
he has married the wrong woman, a hard, conven- 
tional, material-minded creature, and has meanwhile 
learned to love the right one, an illegitimate Polish 
girl of humble connections, with an immense capa- 
city for love and self-sacrifice. It seems to be a 
condition of his regeneration that he shall divorce 
his wife, and of our sympathy that we shall accept 
both this step, and the irregular relations that he 
establishes with Cazia, whose own previous life has 
not been inerrant. What really saves him, in con- 
junction with, or in despite of, these unfortunate 
things, is the dream of an industrial community, 
based upon cooperation and mutual helpfulness, 
which shall make meaningless the class struggle 
between employer and employed, and which, after 
surmounting many obstacles, he succeeds in making 
a reality. It is a matter-of-fact story, for the most 
part, but one that is shot through with gleams of 
the imaginative vision. 

"The Quarry," by Mr. John A. Moroso, is the 
story of a country lad, a mechanic by trade, who 
goes to New York in search of work, falls into bad 
company, and becomes implicated (although entirely 
innocent) in a burglary which results in the murder 
of a night watchman. The boy is arrested, tried, 
and convicted on circumstantial evidence, the most 
damning fact being that his finger-prints are found 
on the instrument of the murder one of his tools 
which the real criminals have stolen and used for 
their horrid purpose. Being friendless, he is rail- 
roaded to Sing Sing, and becomes No. 60,108 be- 
fore he has gotten over being dazed by his ill fortune. 
He has for a cell-mate one Bill Hawkins, a burglar 
of parts with a big heart, who befriends him, and 
devises a plan for his escape. The plan works, 
and the boy swims across the Hudson, hides in the 
Hackensack marshes, and makes his way to the 
South, where, under an assumed name, he becomes 
a cotton-mill worker, and eventually a successful 
inventor and mill-owner. This takes many years,

and all the while Mike Kearney, a New York police 
sleuth, is on his trail, like a modern Javert. The 
fugitive hides his tracks so well that pursuit is 
baffled, but one slight clue is at last discovered, 
and the detective is hot after the quarry. When the 
fugitive is on the point of arrest, he deliberately 
mutilates his hands in the mill machinery, knowing 
that the Bertillon record of his finger-prints is the 
only certain hold that the law has upon him, and 
thereby destroys the evidence of his identity. In 
the end, his name is cleared by a death-bed confes- 
sion of the real murderer. The story is simply 
and tensely told, without any attempt at ornament, 
and holds the interest throughout its entire course. 
As a sort of secondary hero, Bill Hawkins has a 
large share in that interest, and the ingenuity with 
which the detective stalks his quarry also wins our 
admiration. 

"The Hill of Venus," by Mr. Nathan Gallizier, 
is an ultra-romantic historical narrative of Italy in 
the thirteenth century, of Guelf and Ghibelline, of 
church and state, and of the warring ambitions of 
petty princes. The hero is one Francesco Villani, 
who loves the fair Ilaria, and who, upon his father's 
death-bed plea, renounces the world for the monas- 
tery. But the call of the flesh proves too imperious, 
and in the end wrests him from his vows and unites 
him with the woman he loves. There is much stir- 
ring incident in this narrative, but it is so gummed up 
with rhetoric as to be difficult of vivid apprehension. 
What is intended to be fine writing is for the most part 
fustian, and even the interest of the story's historical 
setting does not save it from being tiresome. 

We often wonder whether " Anthony Hope " 
would have published "The Prisoner of Zenda" had 
he foreseen the number and character of the tales 
that were to be its progeny. In regular procession, 
they have been issuing from the press every year 
since, reaching in " Graustark " their lowest possible 
depth, and occasionally rising comparably near the 
level of their prototype. Mr. Ralph Goodwin, in 
"The Stoenberg Affair," has done rather better 
than most of these imitators, and he really makes 
the old puppets seem almost alive, with blood rather 
than sawdust in their veins. The adventurer does 
not get the princess, because she is preempted, but 
he does her valiant service, and the lady-in-waiting 
a very charming person becomes his consolation 
prize. 

A breezy story, told in plain journalistic fashion, 
with much invention and little artifice, is offered by 
the "Brass Faces" of Mr. Charles McEvoy. A girl 
who has run away from school to meet a wooer 
whom she expects to marry, finds him somewhat 
less than fancy has painted, and regrets her escapade. 
He has got her into London lodgings, where she 
finds herself a prisoner. She writes a note appealing 
for aid and it comes into the hands of a nocturnal 
passer-by. Now this young man has for some time 
been leading a dual life, albeit a blameless one, and 
in his assumed character occupies a secluded cottage 
in the country. He rescues the girl, hides her in 



the cottage, and straightway falls in love with her. 
All England rings with the mystery of the alleged 
abduction, and a shrewd young American detective 
woman is put in charge of the case. She soon spots 
the young man, shadows him, discovers the where- 
abouts of the cottage, and forces its occupants to 
take a hasty flight. The pursuit grows highly 
exciting, when the young man, discovering the girl's 
long-lost father, obtains his consent to a marriage. 
Whefc the facts come out, the first aspirant, the scion 
of a noble house, becomes alarmed at the prospective 
scandal, and declares honorable intentions. Where- 
upon the girl says that that was all she wanted, and 
capitulates, leaving her rescuer with the poor con- 
solation of knowing that he has been the means of 
this unforeseen union. The young man, thus basely 
deserted, then discovers that the American detective 
woman is the real object of his affections, and there 
the story ends. It is not particularly refined comedy, 
but it has originality of plot and freshness of interest, 
which are as much as we have any right to expect. 
The versatile Mr. Snaith has again contrived a 
new style for his latest novel, "An Affair of State." 
This is a work which takes us into the thick of con- 
temporary English politics, imagining a crisis which 
might easily become a fact of English history at 
almost any time. James Draper is the chief figure 
in a government which strikingly resembles the un- 
holy coalition that has now been undermining the 
Constitution for several years, and is at present pur- 
suing with unabated, if somewhat chastened, zeal its 
monstrous designs. At the opening of the story, a 
measure is pending which, if it become law, will 
commit the country irrevocably to the tyranny of 
the hosts of labor. It is all to be done in the name 
of democracy, but Draper has become skeptical of the 
cause which he has hitherto championed. "There 
is something right here," he said, clasping his fore- 
head, " that seems to tell me that the time has come 
when we who love England must start to back the 
engine." His confidant is Lady Rockingham, whose 
husband is a pillar of the old order. The conference 
steels Draper to a great resolution, and a few days 
later he rises in the House, and makes a speech of 
such eloquence and destructive criticism against the 
Conciliation bill that he is given a majority in the 
division that follows, and the government is forced 
out of office. Then follows a time of distraction, of 
pulling and hauling, of desperate efforts to form a 
new government, and of threatened shipwreck be- 
cause there is no strong hand at the helm. In spite 
of the extremists of his own party, who regard him 
as a renegade, and of the tory leaders, who regard 
him as the arch-enemy of their order, Draper is so 
clearly the strongest, man in England that there is 
a deep-seated conviction that he is the one man to 
restore order out of the disorder which his act has 
created. There are many conferences, and cabals, 
and projects, in which the leaders of the opposing 
factions take part, and in which the King is an influ- 
ential figure. Draper's enemies nearly accomplish 
his undoing by starting a scandal about his friendly 



22

[July 1 



relations with Lady Rockingham, and the social 
aspect of the matter is still further complicated by 
the defection of his wife, who has engaged in an 
intrigue with Lord Rockingham. The final plea of 
the Crown is that the latter shall form a government 
in which Draper shall also serve. Things come to 
a crisis in a country house conference, where a very 
tense situation is created by Draper, who not only 
refuses to serve under Rockingham, but deliberately 
affronts him, and challenges him to a duel. A way 
is found out of the impasse by Rockingham, who 
yields to the importunities of his terrified colleagues 
by failing to meet Draper at the appointed hour, 
and announcing his withdrawal from political life. 
Under the circumstances, he has nothing left to do 
but to take his own life, whereby the country is 
saved from imminent peril, and a new ministry is 
formed under Draper's leadership. It would be 
unfair to seek to identify too closely the leading 
figures in this story. There is something, but not 
much, of Mr. Lloyd George in the character of 
Draper, and more of Mr. Balfour in the character 
of Evan Manleverer. As characterizations, both 
these figures, as well as several others, are masterly 
creations, and the whole story is told with a com* 
pression and an intensity which make it a very 
remarkable work. Everything counts, dialogue, cor- 
respondence, description, by-play; there is no sur- 
plusage, no extraneous matter not absolutely essential 
to the development of the action. Mr. Snaith has 
brought no finer artistic power to bear upon the finest 
of his previous performances, and this is no small 
thing to say of the author, for example, of " William 
Jordan, Junior." 

To say that a novel is the work of Mr. Humfrey 
Jordan is to commend it in high terms to all who 
have read "The Joyous Wayfarer." The title of his 
new book is "Patchwork Comedy," and its theme 
is the protection of a woman's good name from the 
assaults of a blackmailer, and the final discomfiture 
of the villain. The woman is the mother of Charles 
Carfew, the hero, and has long been dead when the 
story opens. Knowledge of a youthful indiscretion 
on her part comes into the possession of a slimy 
adventurer of Continental ill-repute, who uses it as 
a means of successfully bleeding the family for many 
years. When Charles comes to his inheritance, he 
is not disposed to be submissive, and makes it his 
purpose to hunt down the blackmailer and bring 
him to justice. How this is done, with the aid of 
Morton, a young sculptor, and of Margery Gillanby, 
freed from a brute of a husband after several years 
of married misery, is told in a story which combines 
an exciting and complicated plot with a quiet rem- 
iniscent manner of narration. Both the men love 
Margery, and Carfew is the one who wins her. The 
scene shifts from England to France and Switzer- 
land, and back again. It is distinctly a pleasant 
story to read, because it has the finished style and 
the wide outlook of an accomplished man of letters, 
which qualities in no way detract from its vivid 
portraiture and dramatic effectiveness. 



In the story of "The Man Who Would Not Be 
King," Mr. Sidney Dark expounds, with much force 
and pungent humor, a philosophy of somewhat 
exaggerated individualism. The story is so entirely 
made the embodiment of a thesis that it becomes a 
rather lifeless performance, and its interest lies far 
less in its action than in its shrewd running com- 
mentary upon the organization of society. The best 
part of it, in fact, is the ''prefatory note" which 
makes no pretence of fictive disguise, and in which 
the author hits straight from the shoulder, making 
vehement onslaught on the aims and methods of the 
hypocritical philistinism which is advocated in the 
name of social welfare. The most important thing 
for a man to do is to live as nearly untrammelled an 
existence as possible, and this proposition implies as 
a corollary that he shall not try to shape the lives 
of other people according to his notions. This is a 
much-needed gospel, and Mr. Dark preaches it so 
convincingly and so delightfully that we make no 
apology for quoting at considerable length from his 
preface. " For years," he says, " I have been 
impressed by the disgusting tyranny, ever growing 
more grinding, exercised by politicians, philanthro- 
pists, social reformers, and other virtuous persons, 
over the lives of the great mass of everyday men 
and women who are bored by politics (except at 
elections), have no desire whatever to be reformed, 
and merely desire to live and love and have a good 
time. We (for I am one of them) are being 
threatened by experts, by scientists, by sociologists, 
by all manner of interfering people mostly well- 
to-do, and nearly all without enough blood in their 
veins to sin or enough soul to repent who yearn 
to make us sober, healthy, industrious, efficient, 
virtuous and inhuman." This theory of life he 
calls Webbism, for " Mr. Sidney Webb is the type of 
these enemies of the people," and " all the moralists, 
all the parsons of evangelical faith, most of the 
politicians, all the Labour Members, and all the 
old women are Webbists." Crushed and subdued 
by them are "all the common natural men in all the 
public-house bars in the country (a mighty and a 
pleasant multitude), all the mystics, all the children, 
all the tramps, all the lovers, quite a number of 
respectable citizens and I think Mr. Robert 
Blatchford." We who are natural men have our own 
ideas about the value of "getting on." We drop the 
bone for the shadow but we find the shadow 
delightful. We pursue the will-o'-the-wisp and think 
it good hunting. We blunder and sin, and sorrow 
and rejoice, and repent, and blunder again. The 
obstinate determination of the average man to be a 
man is a rock of offence to the social reformer. 
Against that determination he wages ceaseless war 
with eugenics (the filthiest and most bestial doctrine 
ever propounded), with minority reports, with tee- 
total legislation, with tracts and pamphlets and 
wearisome talk." Mr. Dark's philosophy of life is 
expressed in the following vigorous terms: "The 
blood flows fast in the veins of the common man. 
He must now and then shout and dance, bonnet a

policeman, fall in love with his neighbor's wife, write 
a poem, or chuck his money into the river. The 
curse of our time is that man, since he has discovered 
wireless telegraphy and made an aeroplane, is con- 
vinced that he is wiser than God. We are to be 
born not in the splendid haphazard of reckless 
passion, but after careful medical selection, like 
racehorses on a stud farm. Confusion is the rule 
and the glory of nature. The stars have been thrown 
higgledy-piggledy into the heavens. The whole 
scheme of things is magnificently rollicking disorder. 
But man is to live by rule and according to science. 
Laws are passed without the slightest consideration 
of the needs of the natural man. The Webbist is 
dissatisfied with man as God has made him and is 
eager to create a man in his own image, just as the 
modern painter is dissatisfied with God's world and 
has made a world of his own." It would be easy 
for the cold-blooded logical analyst to pick holes in 
this plea for untrammelled individuality, but with so 
much of it as is outraged by the manifold petty 
restrictions that society imposes on freedom of action 
in matters essentially personal, we are heartily in 
sympathy. The most pestiferous persons on earth 
are those who make it their life endeavor to interfere 
with us for our own good, regulating our food and 
drink and amusements and little personal habits in 
the name of such high-sounding abstractions as 
temperance and education and efficiency and eugenics 
and morality. Wherever a legislature or a board 
or a commission exists they infest its membership 
and pervert its legitimate function. "Dost thou 
think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no 
more cakes and ale ? " We trow not, if man have 
any manhood left. As a commentary upon these 
principles, Mr. Dark's novel is not altogether success- 
ful. His hero, who has led a joyous and care-free 
existence, suddenly finds himself at the head of the 
Peptonized Soup industry, which has been carried 
on by his family for generations, and which has 
created the model community of Slavingtonville, in 
which men live in material comfort and spiritual 
starvation under the puritanical rule of the company. 
He stirs things up a good deal, but his effort to bring 
freedom into the life of the community results in a 
demoralization that he has not anticipated. After a 
year of management, he chucks the whole thing, 
having made a mess of it, and returns to his former 
mode of existence, which cannot, however, be as 
irresponsible as before, because he takes with him 
the pretty office stenographer for a wife. " God bless 
us, every one," is his cry at the close, adding " It is 
rather a splendid wish, and it would come true, too, 
if we would only let Him." 

Reading the opening chapters of Mrs. Helen 
Reimensnyder Martin's "The Parasite," we find it 
difficult to escape from the impression that we are 
occupied with a novel by Mr. John Reed Scott, for 
the theme is not the manners and customs of the 
Pennsylvania Germans, but those of frivolous society 
in Baltimore, and this theme is Mr. Scott's special 
province. The story deals with a man of middle 



age, divorced from his wife (wherein he has not 
been guiltless), and left with the charge of their 
small son, whom he idolizes, and of whom she plots 
to gain possession. Randall is wealthy, besides be- 
ing a man of parts, and carries on a flirtation with 
a society belle, who is making a dead set at him. 
Then he surprises everybody by a sudden marriage 
with " the parasite," who is a young woman of good 
family in reduced circumstances, and a hanger-on 
in the homes of her prosperous relatives and friends. 
She is thought to be a designing creature, because 
she has attached to herself the affection of Randall's 
child, but this seems to have been done without an 
interested motive. At all events, it so touches Ran- 
dall that he offers to annex her to his household, to 
become his wife in name only, but not in communion 
of spirit. The proposition is made in a cold-blooded 
way, and accepted without effusion of sentiment. 
It is obvious that these two are destined to discover 
love after marriage, an outcome which is precipitated 
by an amazing plea made by the wife not long after 
their union, which gives Randall furieusement & 
penser, and makes the reader gasp for breath. 
Bluntly, it is that she be allowed to become a mother 
by other means than those the law has sanctioned, 
and that he both condone the lapse and father the 
child. This, as Art em us Ward would have said, is 
"tu mutch," and, as Randall rejects it, he recognizes 
the dawning of love for his wife in his own breast. 
From this happening on, the way is smooth, and 
the happy ending speedily follows. 

Miss I. A. R. Wylie, whose knowledge of Indian 
life, and whose skill in its portrayal in fictive form, 
are comparable with those of Mrs. Steel, has for the 
second time given us a powerful novel of life in the 
chief of England's dependencies. It presents the 
contrast between eastern and western modes of 
thought as exemplified by typical figures of the rul- 
ing and the subject races. Miss Wylie understands 
them both, and helps us to understand them in "The 
Daughter of Brahma," a narrative of original plot 
and absorbing interest. The heroine is a Brahman 
girl, consecrated from childhood to the worship of 
Siva, and trained by the priests to become the Joan 
of Arc of a native uprising against the oppressor. 
The hero is the posthumous child of an English 
officer, slain in Kolruna by a native fanatic, and 
brought up there by his widowed mother. The 
mother is a woman of Spartan character who hates 
her son because she cannot discern in him the heroic 
traits of character which are the tradition of his line. 
She believes him a coward, and the subsequent rev- 
elation of his moral courage comes too late to save 
him from a life embittered by the knowledge that 
his mother despises him. He gets sight of the cere- 
monies attendant upon the worship of Sarasvati, the 
Brahman priestess, and penetrates into the mystery 
of the secret temple in which the rites take place. 
He becomes enamoured of the girl, who willingly 
flees with him, and then, to the horror of his family 
and friends, makes her his wife. He takes her to 
England, having unexpectedly succeeded to the

family title and estates, and seeks to enter public 
life. But the fact that his wife is a black woman is 
a terrible handicap to him, and his love slackens 
when he realizes the gulf between them, and 
especially when he discovers that his feeling for an 
English girl, the comrade of his youth in Kolruna, 
has grown into something more than friendship. 
Meanwhile Brahman emissaries have come to En- 
gland, having tracked the lost Sarasvati, and so work 
upon her racial and religious feelings that she con- 
sents to flee with them, and resume the interrupted 
r6le of inspirer and deliverer of her people. The 
scene again shifts to Kolruna, and the situation 
becomes very tense, as the mutiny is imminent, and 
the garrison in extreme peril of massacre. The 
climax is reached when the husband makes his way 
to his wife and the sight of him deters her from pro- 
nouncing the words in which she has been trained, 
and which will unleash the powers of hell in the 
threatened residency. Sarasvati is slain by a baffled 
fanatic, and the situation is saved. What will 
become of the hero when time shall have healed 
the scars of the tragedy is left to be surmised.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

It is not too much to say that no 

in the Arctic otner record of Arctic exploration 
in recent years excels in compelling 
human interest Mr. Ejnar Mikkelsen's simple and 
manly story of the attempt to recover the lost jour- 
nals of the Danmarks expedition, "Lost in the 
Arctic: Being the Story of the 'Alabama' Expedi- 
tion, 1909-1912 " (Doran). The Danmarks expe- 
dition had started out in the summer of 1906, under 
the leadership of Mylius Erichsen, "with the object 
of exploring the as yet unexplored part of the north- 
east coast of Greenland, from Cape Bismarck to Cape 
Bridgemann, covering over six degrees of latitude. 
. . . Two years later, in August of 1908, a message 
from the Danmarks Expedition was flashed around 
the world : ' Object attained, coast surveyed, the 
outline of Greenland now known throughout its ex- 
tent, important scientific results obtained in various 
fields,' but the leader, Mylius Erichsen, with Lieut. 
Hoeg Hagen, and the Eskimo Bronlund, perished 
after a heroic struggle against the difficulties of the 
country." Captain Mikkelsen adds: "The result 
of the expedition, a piece of surveying work, the 
difficulty of which few perhaps can better appreciate 
than I myself, was in part attained by the death of 
these three men." None of the diaries or observa- 
tion books were found, and for the sake of the three 
brave men who had given their lives in a last des- 
perate effort to preserve the results of their explo- 
ration, as well as because of the scientific value of 
the records themselves, the present expedition was 
undertaken. The hardships, the suffering, the con- 
tinual struggle against almost insurmountable ob- 



stacles, and the indomitable courage that had marked 
the journey of Erichsen, of which we already know 
the story, were equally present in the long sledge 
expedition of Mikkelsen into the far north. The 
latter and his companions fortunately survived; 
though as one reads his narrative, graphic in its un- 
studied manner, and convincing in its modest recital 
of heroic achievement, one wonders how human en- 
durance could possibly survive such an ordeal. The 
story reveals the plucky little band of explorers 
struggling on day after day and week after week, 
fighting their way through terrific arctic blizzards, 
creeping by way of frail snow bridges across fathom- 
less crevasses, struggling up the sides of icy moun- 
tains, crawling painfully over the rugged sea-ice ; and 
then, as the season advances, wading doggedly day 
after day through deep, soft snow, slush, and water, 
risking their lives repeatedly amid the grinding 
turmoil of the ice-pack, because they must at all 
costs get forward; taking hunger and cold cheer- 
fully as part of the ordinary routine of the day's 
work, and facing manfully the most trying ordeal 
of waiting day after day in camp for the ice to set 
and open a road, while their small stock of provisions 
rapidly dwindles; hunting from early morning till 
dark and finding nothing; reaching at last a cache 
of provisions, to find it rifled and empty; losing their 
dogs from starvation and exhaustion, and feeding 
them to the others, and in the end to themselves; 
finally, haunted by starvation and scurvy, and with 
the last remnants of their strength about gone, drag- 
ging their unwilling feet the last few miles to the 
main camp, Danmarks Havn, only to discover their 
ship crushed in the ice, their companions gone, and 
themselves condemned to another winter in the Arctic, 
when they had been dreaming of home and all that 
home implied. This is the story that Mikkelsen 
tells. It is one worth the telling, and one not easily 
forgotten. 

An artist's Edward Martin Taber, artist, nature- 

communings lover, poet, was born on Staten Island 
with nature. in I$Q^ and died at Washington, 

Connecticut, in 1896. Exiled from New York for 
his health in 1887, after a European tour and other 
excursions in quest of bodily strength, he took up 
his abode at Stowe, in northern Vermont, and there 
remained until within a few months of his death. 
His notes and self-communings, made there and else- 
where, with selections from his letters and verses, 
and sketches from his ready pencil, are now brought 
together and published in a handsome octavo 
under the title, "Stowe Notes, Letters and Verses" 
(Houghton). Like that earlier naturalist, poet, and 
recluse, Thoreau, Taber shows in his writings the 
most intimate and loving intercourse with nature. 
Here is one of this artist-naturalist's winter notes: 
" This day is perfect winter, clear as a bell, whelmed 
and softened in sunlight, with an icy-flowing north 
wind, to which the pines sing, though bare boughs 
are silent. The trees on the mountains are com- 
pletely snow-covered with the sun upon them,

even the evergreens show no trace or hint of green. 
Hogback is a frosted cake, a coral reef its spots 
of shadow deep purple-blue." In the following the 
writer, like all persons of imagination, reads his 
own fancies into the things about him: "As I 
passed through a sugar-wood in the still and quiet 
afternoon, the maples had a knowing air as of half- 
tamed creatures conscious of a power unshared by 
the wilder spirits of their kind the wondering 
beeches, birches, ashes, and elms and seemed 
aware of the friendly office they perform, and to 
acquiesce, as well they may, since accident in the 
blood of them insures a certain protection, if not 
care." Fine feeling and quick sympathies show in 
the work of both pen and pencil in this volume. 
A short biographical and appreciative preface is 
supplied by " F. T. H.," and Mr. Abbott H. Thayer 
also contributes a brief introduction. In conclu- 
sion, and as an illustration of the exiled invalid's 
undaunted spirit, we cannot forbear giving the 
last eight lines of his poem, "Winter's Answer to 
Misgivings." In response to the question, "Why 
struggle &till against despair ? How long resist the 
creeping gloom?" he replies in ringing tones: 

" As long as crowns that hilltop bare 
The pine against the azure sky, 
And gives its music to the air, 
And waves its tasselled boughs on high ; 
As long as shall the chickadee 
Flit, lisping sweet, from tree to tree ; 
As long as on this slope's displayed 
The sumach's dauntless red cockade." 



Essays in 
humanistic 



Since the death of William James, 
the leaders of the pragmatic move- 
ment haye been p ro fe 8Sor J o h n 

Dewey in America and Dr. F. C. S. Schiller in 
England. The Englishman has that happy sense 
of humor and of human values which characterized 
James, and which causes his books to attract a large 
lay public. His volume of philosophical essays 
entitled "Humanism" (Macmillan) is now issued 
in a second edition, brought up to date by the 
inclusion of four new essays, two of which deal 
with topics which have become common since the 
original publication of the essays. The first of these 
new essays is entitled "Solipsism." The reader who 
disregards the forbidding harshness of that label 
and plunges into the essay will read it in its entirety 
for its philosophical good sense, no less than for its 
humor. The theory that life is nothing but experi- 
ence, and that you whoever, gentle reader, you may 
be are the sole experiencer, such is Solipsism. 
Absurd as this definition may sound to common- 
sense, it is the logical outcome of the premises of 
several popular and imposing systems of philosophy. 
How and why this is, Dr. Schiller shows in detail. 
His most surprising showing, however, is that 
Solipsism of some degree is implied in the newest 
and most objective of philosophies the New 
Realism, in its several varieties. Of course Dr. 
Schiller is far from implying that the New Realism 
intends to be solipsistic ; but he shows how its 



rejection of ideas as mediating between man and 
the outer world, and its insistence that man sees 
reality directly, leaves it quite unable to explain the 
different versions people give of what they see and 
their different reactions thereto, or to explain the 
relation between knowledge and opinion, except on 
the hypothesis that the particular realist in point 
regarded himself as the one final court of appeal 
and his fellows as other than real. Of course 
Solipsism, whether considered in itself or as an 
outcome of Realism, is not to be taken very seriously ; 
but this making a bogey out of it for the new realist 
is a most effective way of drawing attention to his 
weaknesses. Another of the new essays called forth 
by recent tendencies of importance is that entitled 
"Infallibility and Toleration"; it takes the recent 
Catholic encyclical against Modernism as the text 
for a discussion of some of the logical consequences 
involving intolerance as a duty which flow from 
absolutism and rationalism as systems of philosophy. 
While some of these essays are couched in more 
technical language than is found in the more popular 
books of William James, Dr. Schiller is often more 
coherent and suggestive than James in his positive 
contributions to one's stock of working conceptions 
of the universe in its spiritual aspects, and so his 
latest volume may confidently be recommended to 
the lay reader. 

A ten days' What one likes best about Mr. Ed- 
tramp on an , mi > i i e j j. 

old Enough ward Thomas s book for pedestrians, 

highway. "The Icknield Way" (Dutton), is 

its admirable restraint, its freedom from "gush," 
its scholar's preference for the under-statement to 
the over-statement. In his assertion that " stumping 
along on a shoeful of blisters is not bad when you 
are out of Royston and have Pen Hills upon your 
left; low, insignificant, restful stretches upon your 
right ; and Odsey before you in the cool of evening," 
there is no painting of the pleasures of walking in 
rainbow hues that will cause subsequent disappoint- 
ment to the reader. And when he says that "we 
walk for a thousand reasons, because we are tired 
of sitting, because we cannot rest, to get away from 
towns or to get into them, or because we cannot 
afford to ride; and for permanent use the last is 
perhaps the best, as it is the oldest," he does not 
claim for himself any sublimated passion for pedes- 
trianism, such as it is given to but few to experience. 
His chronicle of a ten days' tramp on the Icknield 
Way, from Thetford to Wanborough, is a sober un- 
pretentious narrative, but full of reality, of human 
nature, and of that other and larger nature of which 
mankind is but a part. Of the Icknield Way itself we 
learn that "it is the name of two apparently distinct 
roads: one with a Roman look running north and 
south through Worcestershire and Warwickshire, 
the other winding with the chalk hills through 
Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Bedford- 
shire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, 
and Wiltshire." It is with the second road that the 
book has to do. The origin of the name " Icknield "

THE DIAJ,

is lost in obscurity, though several derivations are 
suggested by ancient authorities, whom the author 
duly cites. He also, with a sort of humorous 
exaggeration of the extent to which he has taken 
his readers into the musty atmosphere of these old 
chroniclers, says of his own narrative that it "was 
to have been a country book, but I see that it has 
turned out to be another of those books made out of 
books founded on other books." On the contrary, 
it is preeminently, after the introductory historical 
matter is past, a book about the country and its 
varied attractions; and its charms are heightened 
by the numerous illustrations, in color and in pen 
and ink, contributed by Mr. A. L. Collins. A map 
and an index complete the work. 

Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell's " Labra- 

The resources 

and possibilities dor : The Country and the Jreople 
of Labrador. (reviewed in THE DIAL, Dec. 16, 
1909) is now issued in a revised and enlarged edition 
(Macmillan). A new and timely chapter is added 
on Conservation and Exploration, the object being 
to illustrate the present and prospective resources of 
the country as a storehouse and game sanctuary, and 
the importance of conservation of these resources, 
not only to the country itself, but in the interests of 
the ever-increasing population of the North Amer- 
ican continent. Dr. Grenfell emphasizes the ideal 
situation of Labrador as an immense natural game 
reserve, but sounds a note of warning as to the 
urgent need of protection. He shows that the in- 
habitants of the region, Whites, Eskimo, and Indian, 
are almost absolutely dependant upon animal food, 
and that the sources of their supply, such as codfish, 
capelin, seal, herring, walrus, whale, are rapidly 
diminishing, and in some cases (for instance, herring 
and walrus) have practically disappeared. The same 
thing applies to the land animals, caribou, duck, 
goose, grouse, and curlew. The record is disheart- 
ening, and would be more so but that Dr. Grenfell 
shows clearly that it is not yet too late to replenish 
the land and neighboring waters by protecting their 
inhabitants. He goes even further. The experiment 
of introducing reindeer has been notably successful, 
and promises not only to supply the needs of the 
people of Labrador, but to afford an ever-increasing 
surplus of meat for export to outside markets. Dr. 
Grenfell discusses briefly the possibilities of fur- 
farming, pulp-wood, and the utilization of Lab- 
rador's unrivalled water-powers. "In short," he 
hopefully concludes, "everything seems to point to 
the fact that Labrador will come to her own in the 
not very distant future." A much-needed bibliog- 
raphy, and some remarks about the habits of the 
land mammals of the country, are also added to this 

edition. 

The story of The story of the accumulation of 
the Rothschild the " greatest aggregate fortune . . . 
that the world has ever seen or is 
likely to see " is a marvellously interesting one, and 
Mr. Ignatius Balla has told it well in "The Romance 
of the Rothschilds" (Putnam). Starting with the 



small beginnings of the humble Frankfort bank- 
clerk, Maier Amschel, surnamed " Rothschild " (Red 
Shield) apparently from the painted sign that hung 
over his door in Jew Street, the volume traces the 
work of each prominent member of the family, 
down to the present head of each branch, Lord 
Nathan in London, Robert Philip, James, and 
Maurice in Paris, and Baron Ludwig in Vienna, 
the original bank in Frankfort and the one in 
Naples having been discontinued. It is clear from 
the story that the great secret of the family's unpre- 
cedented success lies in the fact that they have always 
worked together, almost invariably marrying among 
themselves, and always consulting with one another 
before taking any important step. If the dozen 
ablest financiers in the world to-day could be brought 
into such perfect harmony and sympathy that each 
would reckon the advantage of the others quite as 
much worth seeking as his own, the combine would 
literally rule the world; and this was substantially 
the state of affairs with this international organiza- 
tion of brothers, cousins, uncles, and nephews, fifty 
years ago. The quality in the group that strikes the 
reader of this book most forcibly is their absolute 
integrity. So far from ever misrepresenting, they 
never even attempted to withdraw from a bad bar- 
gain. The Bank of England was uncertain com- 
pared to their own, the former institution, in 
fact, would have gone under in 1825 without their 
assistance ; and there was as much truth as sarcasm 
in BiJrne's qualification of a difficulty between the 
family and the Austrian government as a disagree- 
ment between two world-powers. The great nations 
have gained in stability and independence until the 
Rothschild fortunes are relatively unimportant to- 
day; so that the family's rise from obscurity to the 
maximum of influence was the work of one short 
century. 

Adjure and Man y yf Englishmen, first and 
misadventure last, have left their native island and 
in many lands. SOU ght the Canadian far-west and 
other parts of the world in the spirit of adventure 
or the hope of gain, but few if any have chronicled 
their experiences more entertainingly than Mr. 
Ralph Stock in his " Confessions of a Tenderfoot " 
(Holt), which professes to be "the true and unvar- 
nished account of his world wanderings," and is en- 
livened with many views caught by the wanderer's 
camera on the way. Cow-punching, ranching, 
cattle-tending on a cattle steamer, beating his way 
westward again on freight trains, life in a British 
Columbian lumber camp, glimpses of the Sandwich 
and the Fiji Islands, fruit- farming at a loss in Queens- 
land, and finally a successful venture in the purchase 
of a pineapple plantation in the same quarter of the 
globe all this and much else may be found set forth 
in brisk and often admirably picturesque and idio- 
matic form in Mr. Stock's book. An unusually severe 
winter, the worst in twenty five years, encountered 
by him just after he had secured a "bunch" of 
cattle and started ranching on his own account, leads

him to the following conclusion: "I have learnt 
many things by travel; among others, that stock- 
raising in any country is a game of chance ; that the 
Canadian prairie is neither better nor worse than 
her sister colonies Australia with her droughts 
and South Africa with her rinderpest and that life 
the world over is a see-saw, and one cannot always 
be at the upper end." The seeming composure with 
which the author remains at or near the lower end 
until just before the close of his tale is not the least 
of the factors contributing to the excellence of the 
book. His story was well worth putting into book 
form. _ 

So completely is modern literature 
the expression of social forces, that 
ft canno t be understood without a 
knowledge, at least in its broad outlines, of the 
intellectual history of Europe during the last hun- 
dred and fifty years. To give some idea of the 
relation between these forces and literature is the 
purpose of Professor Philo M. Buck's "Social Forces 
in Modern Literature" (Ginn), though of course it 
does not pretend to do more than " draw into a focus 
what else is fragmentary and scattered." For a 
treatise of this extent the literature is almost inev- 
itably limited to France, England, and Germany; 
the topics are represented by such as the intellectual 
and emotional revolutions in France as in Montes- 
quieu and Rousseau, the intellectual revolution in 
Germany as in Lessing, the beginnings of romanti- 
cism in England as in Wordsworth, and the empire of 
beauty as in Shelley. The treatment of romanticism 
and that to which it was in large measure a reaction, 
classicism, is perhaps the least satisfactory in the 
book. Our indispensable eighteenth century is 
given scant courtesy, and the reaction is treated in 
a rather summary way. Shelley is not viewed as 
the ineffectual angel beating in the void his lumi- 
nous wings in vain, but as the leader of a force that 
had beauty as its ideal and that in an age devoted 
to science and business held aloft that ideal till it 
became a part of the idealism of the later century. 

Few of our fellow-citizens speak to 
us with more certainty of being heard 
than the Hon. Oscar S. Straus, and 
the gathering into book form of his various addresses 
and lectures, twenty-two in number, under the suit- 
able title of "The American Spirit" (Century Co.), 
will be welcomed by those who have at heart the best 
expression of our national hopes and fears, problems 
and ideals. The most various occasions brought 
these addresses forth, and they deal with seemingly 
unrelated topics, fused into harmony by a steady 
and uncompromising patriotism. The collection 
begins, appropriately, with George Washington, and 
closes with the response to a toast at a dinner given 
by non-Catholics to the archbishop of New York 
after his being made cardinal, though there are 
two brief tributes to American statesmen to end the 
volume. The topics treated range from sociology to 
manufacturing, from the consular service to the cause

of international peace, from an address to his fellow- 
Jews to a lecture at the American War College. 
Every word shows the intensity of the speaker's 
moral convictions, his love for civil and religious 
liberty, and his devotion to republican institutions. 
Best of all, they show him in touch with every move- 
ment in our common country which he believes 
will make for its spiritual integrity, no less than its 
physical betterment and intellectual progress.

the pen ot Dr. Joseph King Good-

(F. G. Browne & Co.). Other volumes are an- 
nounced treating of the Chinese and the Filipinos. 
Professor Goodrich has had a long acquaintance 
with our brown brothers who are now so prominent 
in our thought, and he is able to write of them in 
neighborly fashion. In an entertaining manner he 
talks of the country and the people, the lords and the 
commoners, the Ainu and the " Earth Spiders," and 
he weaves stories from mythical lore into the nar- 
rative along with incidents from his own experience. 
It is a very human volume. This is evident in the 
interest shown in the life of the farmer and fisher- 
man, as well as in the good neighborly custom of 
criticizing the neighbor. And from cover to cover 
the book is full of interest. In appearance the vol- 
ume is most attractive, of handy size, clear type, 
with almost a score of excellent illustrations, a select 
bibliography, and an index. Surely it will cause 
many a reader to plan a trip to the Land of the Ris- 
ing Sun, or at least to dip into some of the more 
extensive studies of these interesting neighbors of 
ours across the Western sea. 



NOTES. 



Mr. Alexander Irvine, author of " From the Bottom 
Up," has written a record of his mother and his Irish 
childhood, which the Century Co. will publish in August 
under the title, " My Lady of the Chimney Corner." 

" The Wallet of Time " is the title chosen by Mr. 
William Winter for his two volumes of reminiscences 
of the American theatre from 1791 to 1912. Messrs. 
Moffat, Yard & Co. will publish the work in September. 

An interesting record of first-hand sociological expe- 
riences among the unemployed, by Mr. E. A. Brown of 
Denver, will be published in the autumn by Browne & 
Howell Co. in a volume entitled "Broke: The Man 
Without the Dime." 

The collected edition of Francis Thompson's works 
recently announced in this column will be published in 
America by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. There are 
to be three volumes in all, embodying much material 
hitherto unpublished. 

In response to a very general demand, the late Dr. 
Lester F. Ward had brought together for preservation 
in book form all his writings of smaller compass which, 
as first printed, were scattered through more than a 
hundred periodicals and other publications. The papers 
represent the labors of more than half a century, and in

their original form were, with hardly an exception, no 
longer accessible to the general public. These papers 
are to be published by Messrs. Putnam in several vol- 
umes, under the general title, "Glimpses of the Cosmos." 
The first three volumes will appear this month. 

The publication is announced by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
of a volume of " Anniversary Papers," by colleagues 
and pupils of Professor George Lyman Kittredge, in 
honor of the completion of his twenty-fifth year of teach- 
ing in Harvard University. 

It would seem as if Walt Whitman offered little if 
any scope to the illustrator. Yet we note that a selec- 
tion from the " Leaves of Grass," with twenty-four 
illustrations in color by Miss Margaret Cook, is soon to 
be published by Messrs. Dutton. 

An authorized edition of the complete works of Arthur 
Schnitzler is announced by Mr. Richard G. Badger. The 
edition will contain upwards of twenty volumes. Three 
are already in press for immediate publication, and the 
others will follow in rapid succession. 

Miss L. M. Montgomery, author of " Anne of Green 
Gables," writes her publishers that work on her new 
story, " The Golden Road," is " progressing merrily," 
and that undoubtedly the manuscript will be completed 
in time for publication early in August. 

Mr. Edwin Bjorkman's volume of essays, "Voices 
of To-morrow," to be published by Mr. Mitchell Ken- 
nerley, deals in great part with Strindberg, the author- 
ized edition of whose plays was translated by Mr. 
Bjorkman. Other " voices " are Bjornstjerne Bjornson, 
Selma Lagerlbf, Francis Grierson, Maeterlinck, Berg- 
son, George Gissing, Joseph Conrad, Robert Herrick, 
and Edith Wharton. 

" National Supremacy : Treaty Power versus State 
Power," by Mr. Edward S. Corwin of the Department 
of Politics at Princeton, is a book of timely interest 
which Messrs. Holt expect to issue early this month. It 
will furnish a thorough study of the question of the 
competence of the national government in the business 
of making and enforcing treaties in relation to the 
reserved power of the States. 

Thomas A. Janvier, the author, died on June 18 in 
New York City. He was born in Philadelphia in 1849, 
was educated there, and from 1870 to 1881 was chiefly 
engaged in editorial work for Philadelphia newspapers. 
In 1881, after a trip West, he came to New York to 
enter upon a literary career and went to live in the 
Washington Square neighborhood. A few years later 
he published the " Ivory Black Stories," tales of artist 
life, which were reprinted in book form in 1885 as 
"Color Studies." His travels in Mexico produced 
"The Mexican Guide" (1887 et seq.), "The Aztec 
Treasure House" (1890), and " Old New Spain" (1891). 
He and his wife lived for some time at Avignon, France, 
where they formed friendships with Mistral, the poet, 
and Felix Gras. As a result of his residence in France 
Janvier wrote " An Embassy to Provence " (1893), 
"Christmas Kalends of Provence" (1902), and "From 
the South of France" (1912) His book "In Old 
New York" (1894) was widely read. His other books 
are: "The Uncle of an Angel and Other Stories" 
(1891); "In the Sargasso Sea" (1898); "The Passing 
of Thomas and Other Stories" (1900); "In the Great 
Waters" (1901); The Dutch Founding of New York" 
(1903); "Santa Fe's Partner" (1907); "Henry Hud- 
son: His Aims and His Achievements" (1909); and 
"Legends of the City of Mexico" (1910).

HISTORY OF ENGLAND 

By ALLEN C. THOMAS 

Professor of History in Haverford College 
C XCELLENT qualities of this work are charm of style, grasp 
L- 1 of salient facts and principles, and dramatic portrayal of 
the greater personages and periods. The rise of the common 
people from villeinage to a share and later control in repre- 
sentative government is traced with clearness and force. The 
growth of Parliament, the decreasing power of the nobles, 
the influence of great men, the vast social and economic 
changes, the development of the British Empire, and the 
problems of the present are adequately set forth.

The preparation of the new Variorum Edition of the Works 
of Shakespeare was the life work of Dr. Horace Howard 
Furness. 

For many years he was assisted by his son, Horace Howard 
Furness. Jr., to whom now falls the task of editing: the remain- 
in? plays. This important work will, therefore, be continued 
along the same lines. 

The plan of this volume is the same as in the preceding vol- 
umes, and the reader will find evidence of all the learning, care, 
and critical judgment that have made this edition preeminent. 
The text is that of the First Folio of 1623. The textual notes 
give all the various readings from the Second Folio down to the 
present time. In the commentary and appendix will also be 
found further notes, criticisms, and discussions, stage history 
and dramatic versions. In short, within one volume is to be 
found an epitome of a Shakespeare library that would cost a 
large expenditure of time and money to collect.

A Veritable Human Document 

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
OF A WORKING WOMAN 

By ADELHEID POPP 

WITH INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN EDITION BY 
JENKIN LLOYD JONES, LINCOLN CENTER, CHICAGO 

An impressive account of the struggles of a woman 
who undertakes to earn her own livelihood. Will 
be read with interest by all who are concerned with 
the great problem of the woman toiler. 
Dr. Jones says in his introduction. 

Here is the story of a "working woman" 
who has felt the bitterness of hard, unrelenting 
toil, and out of the agony of such a life has 
been brought into sympathy with the Gospel 
side of co-operation. By bitter tears the eyes 
were cleared to read the illuminating message 
of the great democratic movement that assumes 
the name "socialism" in many quarters. 

That working men and women will read this 

book with bated breath and tearful sympathy 

goes without the saying. But it is a book for 

the employer more than for the employee, for 

the more favored rather than the less favored. 

It is a book that ought to find a place among the 

religious books on the center-table of the rich.

THE MON I ST 



An International Philosophical Quarterly Devoted to the Philosophy of Science 

FOUNDED IN 1890 BY EDWARD C. HEGELER 

CONTENTS FOR JULY 1913 

CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE MAHABHARATA Richard Garbe 

Comparative religion : 

The historical possibility that Christian elements are traceable in this great epic of India is 
here treated with scholarly exactness. The Mahabharata attained its final form in the sixth 
or seventh century, A.D. Its final redaction took place in Northern India about the time 
of the Nestorian Missions. 

ROBERT HOOKE AS A PRECURSOR OF NEWTON Philip E. B. Jourdain 

The principal facts on which was based the controversy between Hooke and Newton about 
the theory of gravitation is interestingly related in this article. It illustrates how great is 
the difference between a truth conjectured or asserted and truth demonstrated. 

THE NEW MECHANICS The Late Henri Poincare 

Poincare was surely a wonderworker whose rapid style and swiftness of conclusion carries 
the reader to exhilarating heights, finally leaving him in breathless wonderment at the 
boldness of the flight. 

In this article Newton's mechanics are first smashed, then thrown into the air, and 
finally handed intact to the reader, as if to say, " Now you try it." The Old Mechanics, 
the New Mechanics, the Principle of Relativity, Lorenz, Michelson, are all brilliantly 
displayed in the best Poincare style, closing with the statement, "Whoever does not know 
the old cannot understand the new." 

HISTORY OF PLANT HYBRIDS Wilhelm Obers Focke 

An account of the various doctrines of hybridization which are the source from which text 
books and most of the later theoretical writings on hybrid plants have been derived. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY AS A PHASE IN THE 

DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE Paul Carus 

"The assumption of reference points is absolutely indispensable for any kind of measure- 
ment whether in the new mechanics of relativity, or the commonplace view of traditional 
mechanics." 

THE BOOKS OF PRIMEVAL HISTORY The Late Major J. W. Powell 

Philosophical poem descriptive of the earliest records of the race. 

THE MONISM OF THE MONIST COMPARED WITH PROFESSOR 

HAECKEL'S MONISM Paul Carus 

Evolution, as the immortality of the race, presupposes that man's most individual tendencies 
are preserved as a basis for future progress. In the souls of the generations to come there 
are many mansions for " those immortal dead who live again in minds made better by their 
presence."

EXPLAINING AMERICA. 



This huge democracy of ours requires a good 
deal of explaining to the European intelligence. 
We do much of the explaining ourselves, 
through our representatives in the diplomatic 
service, who rightly regard this as one of their 
official functions, and the fact that the higher 
posts in that service are so frequently filled by 
our leading men of letters tends to make the 
explanation effective. Mr. Lowell, for exam- 
ple, never did his nation a finer service than 
that of delivering his address on "Democracy" 
to an English audience at the time of his tenure 
of diplomatic office. Such services as his are 
as effective as arbitration treaties or other 
formal agencies for the promotion of interna- 
tional good will. And he had an illustrious 
line of predecessors in well-doing, all the way 
down from the time when Franklin and Jeffer- 
son brought visible embodiment of the ideals of 
the coming age to the court in which the ideals 
of an aristocratic society based upon privilege 
were entering upon the inevitable process of 
dissolution. Of recent years, we have been 
sending special intellectual envoys to Europe, 
charged with the special duty of national inter- 
pretation lecturers to the Sorbonne, and ex- 
change professors to Berlin and other capitals. 
It is all to the good, for the better two nations 
come to understand one another, the less the 
chances of friction between them. Tout com- 
prendre, c'est tout pardonner, and a better 
understanding of us might soften even the 
asperities of "The Saturday Review" when 
American affairs engage its attention. 

But busily as we are engaged in explaining 
ourselves, our foreign critics, amateur and 
professional, are still more busily engaged in 
explaining us to their own fellow-countrymen. 
We owe much to the professional expositors, of 
whom Tocqueville, Ostrogorski, and Mr. Bryce 
offer typically conspicuous examples, and not a 
little to the amateurs, even if they are carica- 
turists like Dickens, or supercilious observers 
like Arnold. The work done by Mr. John 
Graham Brooks when he prepared "As Others 
See Us" for "The Chautauquan" a few years 
a,go, collating the opinions expressed by many 
foreign observers during several generations, 



38 



THE DIAL 



[July 16 



was very instructive, and profitable both for 
admonition and for the cultivation of our sober 
self-esteem. Even the tirades of Mrs. Trollope 
and Dickens have their value for reproof, or the 
anguished outpourings of M. de Bacourt, sent 
for his sins by an unfeeling French government 
to dwell among us for a few months in 1840-2. 
This sensitive soul, who relieved his feelings by 
the outburst: "My God! what have I done to 
be obliged to live amongst such people?" and 
who departed for home exclaiming: "I shall 
thank Heaven when I feel that I have placed 
the ocean between me and this dreary abode," is 
in striking contrast to the latest of our foreign 
commentators, the Frenchman to whose recently 
published "Les Etats Unis d'Amerique" we 
now wish to call attention. 

The author of this book, Baron d'Estournelles 
de Constant, has the best of excuses for writing 
about the United States. He has visited us 
upon four occasions since 1902, and travelled 
extensively throughout the country. He ha^ 
studied our life and our institutions under the 
most favorable conditions, and collected a great 
mass of observations, which he has interpreted 
with sympathy and discriminating judgment. 
His new book offers a happy combination of 
impressions de voyage and philosophical reflec- 
tions. It is not a formal treatise in the manner 
of Mr. Bryce's " American Commonwealth," but 
a discursive narrative which is everywhere enter- 
taining, but which is by no means superficial. It 
is sprinkled with rhetorical exclamation points, 
treats our foibles with gentle satire, is outspoken 
about our mistakes of national policy, and deeply 
impressed by our material achievements. Even 
where it is severe in its strictures, it makes us 
feel that the author is dealing the faithful wounds 
of a friend, and tells the harsh truth in a way 
best calculated to spare our susceptibilities. It 
is as amiable as the journal of a six weeks' 
tourist, but has the substance and the penetra- 
tive insight that such a journal usually lacks. 
Now and then it is amusingly naive, as when 
it expresses the author's astonishment at the 
sight of a young man under the manipulations 
of a manicure in a hotel barber-shop. The 
young man, it seems, while one hand is being 
treated as if it were a hand of wax, is using the 
other to hold an open newspaper, which he 
calmly reads while cet ange penche vers lui, sa 
main dans ses mains. This matter-of-fact way 
of dealing with a sentimental situation in which 
a Frenchman would ogle the fair ministrant, 
leads to an " explanatien " of the American 
character that need not be taken too seriously. 



" In the United States sensuality is reduced to 
a minimum ; it is set aside ; people have no 
time to think of it to begin with, then it is felt 
to be a danger in a new country ; thus co- 
education has become possible; young girls 
may dare anything; they finally externalize 
themselves, devoting to useful works, to society, 
and to athletics a share of the impulses which 
nature awakens in them ; then these impulses 
become rarer and less imperious. I do not know 
whether to call it a virtue or good fortune, but 
it is a fact which plays an important part in the 
life of the United States, and must be taken 
largely into account." Truly, on pent etre trop 
philosophe. On the whole, our author avoids 
rash generalizations, saying : Quiconque id 
generalise est un naif' et un ignorant, and 
understanding that there can be few underlying 
principles of unity in a civilization so diversified 
and conglomerate. 

M. d'Estournelles has the occasional lapses 
from accuracy that no Frenchman seems quite 
able to escape. He tells us of his friend, 
Jennings William Bryan, of the eminent divine 
Phillips Brook, and of President Judge of the 
University of Chicago, of the douglas-fir-tries 
of Washington, and of le coktail insidieux. 
He repeatedly speaks of the forty-nine states, 
and falls into other trifling errors from time to 
time. Generally speaking, however, his infor- 
mation is trustworthy, and the aperpus and 
judgments which he bases upon it reveal an 
orderly mind dominated by logic rather than by 
sentiment or prepossession. An idealist himself, 
he is prompt to recognize the idealistic push 
which is back of the gropings of our national 
spirit, and our fundamental purpose to deal 
justly with the perplexing problems offered us 
by education, politics, religion, the suffrage, and 
the Indian and negro elements of our population. 
These problems, and many others, he discusses 
always intelligently and often acutely. And he 
shows himself at every point the enemy of war- 
fare and the uncompromising advocate of the 
policies that make for peace among the nations 
and good will among men. It is where this 
sacred principle is endangered that we find his 
strictures most severe, and his condemnation 
most outspoken. He does not mince matters 
in declaring the folly of our tariff wall, of our 
inflated armaments, and of our monstrous expen- 
diture for pensions. He sees clearly how foolish 
and how utterly unreconcilable with our prin- 
ciples are our recent experiments in colonialism, 
and points out the dangers of a continued refusal 
to "let the island men go free." On the other 



1913]

hand, he makes good-natured fun of the alarm- 
ists who see us plunged into war, now with 
Mexico, now with Japan, and has full confi- 
dence that our fundamental good sense will 
safeguard us against such horrors. On the 
subject of Panama, he is distinctly on the side 
of wisdom and justice, as his summing up of the 
subject will indicate: 

" Thus, from violation to violation, from the question- 
able seizure of a territorial zone to the fortification of 
the canal, from fortification to differential tolls, and 
finally from differential tolls to the refusal of arbitra- 
tion these are, within a few years, the temptations to 
which the United States government has yielded, since 
it has found itself the absolute master of the inter- 
national waterway." 

Truly, a rake's progress, succinctly stated. It 
is for such clear-headed and dispassionate judg- 
ments as these that we should owe our deepest 
debt of gratitude to M. d'Estournelles and to 
the pleasant book in which he has explained us 
to the foreigner. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

A VALUABLE COLLECTION OF EAST-ASIATIC 

LITERATURE has been acquired by the Newberry 
Library, with the expert assistance of Dr. Berthold 
Laufer, who has now prepared a careful "De- 
scriptive Account" of these examples of Chinese, 
Tibetan, Mongol, and Japanese books and manu- 
scripts. The well-printed and beautifully-illustrated 
pamphlet is issued as No. 4 of the Newberry Library 
Publications ; and though its author modestly calls 
it a " brief sketch," it runs to forty-two pages and is 
packed with information of interest to Orientalists, 
and is not uninteresting to others. Six years ago 
Dr. Laufer was commissioned by the Newberry 
Library to obtain a representative collection of 
East- Asiatic works on subjects in which that library 
specializes, religion, philosophy, history, belles- 
lettres, philology, and art. At the same time he 
collected for the John Crerar Library Oriental 
works on geography, law and administration, trade, 
industries, national economy, sociology, agriculture, 
mathematics, medicine, and the natural sciences. 
The two collections together form a notable Oriental 
library; but it is to the Newberry collection alone 
that Dr. Lauf er's pamphlet refers ; and for that col- 
lection he obtained 1216 works in 21,403 volumes, 
which he considers truly representative of the liter- 
atures named. There are 143 works in Japanese, 
310 in Tibetan, 72 Mongol, 60 Manchu; the others 
are in Chinese, "which is the most extensive and 
important literature of the East, and the one from 
which the light of the others radiates." Also, 
"there are eighteen manuscripts, all unpublished 
and deserving of publication." Facsimiles of wood- 
engraving and text are interspersed in the descrip- 



tion, from which we quote, in closing, a brief 
passage of general interest. " Fiction is considered 
by Chinese scholars an inferior branch of litera- 
ture, and is not grouped with literature proper. It 
covers a wide field, nevertheless, and is immensely 
popular. . . . Poetry, however, has always been 
viewed as one of the liberal arts and elegant pas- 
times of a gentleman, and the Chinese have cul- 
tivated it to an extraordinary extent. Its study is 
valuable to us for its high aesthetic merits, but at a 
future date it will surely fulfil a still greater mis- 
sion and furnish the fundamental material for the 
most difficult of all subjects connected with China 
the psychology of the Chinese." 



THE RETURN OF THE WOOD- ENGRAVING, after its 
long banishment at the hands of the cheaper and 
for some uses more effective process print, may 
perhaps be looked for in the near future, if certain 
present indications in book-illustration are not mis- 
leading. Few though the wood-engravers be who 
are now practicing their art, we have in this country 
at least one eminently distinguished exponent of 
xylography who is still delighting the connoisseurs 
with his handiwork. We refer, of course, to Mr. 
Timothy Cole, known to all readers of "The Century 
Magazine." Word comes from London that Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. are favoring more and more the 
old style of illustration in their books of travel and 
description, in preference to the facile and abundant 
photo-engraving. The beautiful bits of scenery 
and architecture executed by Mr. Joseph PennelTs 
skilful hand show us, even though they are not 
reproduced by engraving on wood, how much more 
artistically pleasing and poetically suggestive a pen- 
cil sketch or a pen-and-ink drawing can be than a 
picture that is the product of the soulless camera. 
There is a tidal wave, or, to change the figure, a 
pendulum-swing, in all fashions, sartorial, literary, 
and other, including the mode of graphic illustra- 
tion for books and periodicals; and as the hand- 
made picture has now been out of vogue for nearly 
a generation all illustrating having become more 
or less dependent on mechanical processes its 
revival might, on general principles, be predicted in 
the not very distant future. Not the once too 
familiar caricatures of wood-engraving art do we 
hope to see revived, but such examples as were for- 
merly furnished by Linton, Roberts, and Gardner, 
in England, and by Lepere, Baude, and Jonnard, 
in France, not to mention American engravers, who 
have probably done more than any others to perfect 
the art. The continued existence and activity of 
the International Society of Wood Engravers give 
hope of some such renaissance as is here indicated. 

THE ANNUAL DISCUSSION OF LIBRARY PROBLEMS 

which has recently occupied the attention of our 
librarians in conference assembled impresses the 
observer with the library's increasing closeness of 
relationship to the varied interests and activities of 
modern life. So eager, in fact, has the librarian 



40 



THE DIAL 



[July 16 



become to enlarge and strengthen this relationship 
by every conceivable legitimate device, that Mr. 
Legler, in his presidential address, felt called upon 
to admonish his hearers against letting the methods 
of the moment encroach upon the library's larger 
general usefulness. The importance now attached to 
efficiency and specialization does indeed threaten to 
overshadow the vital human element, and to make 
us forget that even the most wonderfully efficient 
machine is an absolutely soulless, heartless, lifeless 
piece of mechanism. Hence it is well that the 
broadly human factor in library work received 
timely emphasis in the speeches and debates at 
Kaaterskill. Among minor matters pressing for 
attention were the probable future effect of the 
commission form of municipal government upon 
public-library administration ; the ever-present prob- 
lem of book-selection, more particularly of novel- 
selection ; the helpfulness or harmfulness of novels 
in the solution of social and economic problems ; the 
amount of attention that the public library, especially 
the large library, should give to the special needs 
of scholars; the question of granting librarians 
sufficient leisure for both the reading and the recu- 
peration that are necessary if the daily grind is not 
speedily to result in lessened efficiency; and (this 
from the delegate of the British Library Association) 
the detrimental effect of an excessive employment 
of women in library work, not by reason of any 
inferiority in such service, but because the salaries 
offered to young girls and women are so low as to 
tend to diminish the remuneration of men also, and 
to cause hardship in an already underpaid profession. 
On the whole, the attendance at this thirty-fifth 
annual conference, the addresses and discussions, the 
interest shown, and the whole atmosphere of the con- 
vention, give encouraging evidence of the growing 
importance and usefulness of the public library, 
which, as an appreciable factor in promoting the 
public good, is not yet much more than half a cen- 
tury old, and which in its modern development we 
are justified in proudly regarding as preeminently 

an American institution. 



POST-COMMENCEMENT CONTEMPLATIONS may not 
yet be out of order, though the last diploma of the 
season has now been tenderly laid away by the proud 
recipient, or sent to the picture-dealer to be framed. 
From the educationally somewhat backward South 
there comes a cheering note in the form of an 
editorial utterance in the Hattiesburg "News." 
(Hattiesburg is in Mississippi, and has a population 
of somewhat less than twelve thousand. ) The edi- 
torial, which needs no approving comment from us, 
is in the following strain: "A good deal has been 
written and said against Latin and Greek in the 
public schools and in favor of corn and tomatoes. 
We have not the slightest objection to corn and 
tomatoes as side lines, but in school days the boy or 
girl whose attention is not given to books is cheated. 
Hog and hominy is poor diet to feed the mind on. 
Those who value education purely for the money 



there is in it or the money that may be gotten out 
of it, do not know how to value its true value at all. 
Education, 'book education,' broadens the mind, 
gives culture to the man, wakens ambition, inspires 
to higher ideals, and prepares the man for com- 
panionship with books and authors. Agriculture 
has been an honorable calling through all the ages, 
and the greatest men Mississippi has produced 
have come from the farm ; but they were not great 
because they came from the farm, but because they 
educated their minds and learned from books things 
they could not learn on the farm. There is no more 
inviting field of endeavor than may be found on the 
farm. There is no living so sure, no life so inde- 
pendent as the farm life. But the boy on the farm 
who is denied the advantages of that higher and 
broader education which comes from books is badly 
cheated, though he may become the biggest hog 
and hominy grower in Mississippi." No sign of 
surrender there to the modern craze for vocational 
education. ... 

FORMIDABLE FICTION, under which head most 
present-day readers would include the voluminous 
productions of Richardson, if not also those of 
Smollett, and such morally improving tales as the 
benevolent Thomas Day and the excellent Miss 
Aguilar knew so well how to write, gives occasion 
to Mr. Bryce (in his "University and Historical 
Addresses," noticed more at length in another col- 
umn) to indulge in some interesting reminiscences 
of his own earlier readings. "I can just recall an 
austere time," he says, " more than sixty years ago, 
when in Britain not a few moralists and educators 
were disposed to ban novel-reading altogether to 
young people and to treat it even among their elders 
as an indulgence almost as dangerous as the use of 
cards, dice, and tobacco. Exceptions, however, were 
made even by the sternest of these authorities. I 
recollect that one of them gave his imprimatur to 
two stories by an estimable Scottish authoress now 
long forgotten named Miss Brunton. These tales 
were entitled 'Discipline* and 'Self-Control,' and a 
perusal of them was well fitted to discourage the 
young reader from indulging any further his taste 
for imaginative literature. Permitted fiction being 
scanty, I did attack ' Self-Control,' and just got 
through it, but ' Discipline ' was too much for me." 
His further remarks show that this harsh experience 
did not by any means kill Mr. Bryce's taste for 
imaginative literature; "but," he laments, "we 
have no Dickens, no Thackeray, no Hawthorne, no 
George Eliot." ... 

DISGUISED BOOK-TITLES will always furnish book- 
sellers and librarians with amusing puzzles to fill 
their unoccupied half-hours, if they have any, and 
to diversify the daily routine. A small boy rushed, 
breathless, into a certain public library the other 
day, and thus delivered himself at the loan desk : 
" Mother says, please, to send her Browning's pair 
o' scissors ! " Of course it did not take long for the 
well-informed attendant to translate this into a re- 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



41 



quest for " Paracelsus." Somewhat more perplexing 
was the demand that came from a young lady who 
wished to read " Pretty Rita," which she thought 
was a recent novel, but could not remember the 
author. Attempts were made to satisfy her with 
" Pretty Polly," by Clark Russell, and with " Pretty 
Michal," by Jdkai ; but she insisted that the heroine's 
name was Rita, and refused all substitutes. At last 
the patient attendant had a happy thought. " Was 
the author's name Ruskin? " she asked. Yes, that 
was it ; and in a moment " Prseterita " (which if 
improperly accented becomes something like " Pretty 
Rita ") was produced, but, not seeming to have much 
flavor of romance about it, was speedily rejected by 
the hard-to-wait-upon young lady, who finally com- 
promised by taking " Gretchen," by the novelist 
popularly known as " Rita." A writer in the Lon- 
don " Book Monthly " enlivens the pages of that 
interesting periodical with some examples of dis- 
torted titles that have caused a few smiles and 
chuckles in the library world. " Ingoldsby Legends," 
went masquerading as " England's by-legends," 
"The Insanity of Genius" horrified the desk- 
attendant as "The Insanity of Jesus," and a treatise 
on conic sections became a book of " comic selec- 
tions " than which the freak of humorous distortion 
could no further go. 

LITERATURE AND SOCIAL SERVICE were placed in 
aspects of inter-relationship at a late meeting of the 
Bay Path Library Club, a central Massachusetts 
organization, before which Mr. Frederic Kenyon 
Brown (better known as "Al Priddy," author of 
" Through the Mill," " Through the School," and 
"Man or Machine") spoke on "The Human In- 
terest Factors in the Massachusetts Industrial Situ- 
ation." Mr. Brown, his readers will be interested 
in learning, is now pastor of a church at Southwick, 
a position contrasting sharply with that in which his 
first book presents him to view. Following him as 
speaker came Dr. Louis N. Wilson, librarian at 
Clark University ; and then there was some instruc- 
tive book-talk, especially concerning reading matter 
adapted to the needs of mechanics and that appeal- 
ing to agricultural workers. These themes occupied 
the attention of the morning session, and were fol- 
lowed in the afternoon by a consideration of " The 
Library and School as Mutual Helpers," with Mr. 
George Rugg, principal of the Quinsigamond School 
at Worcester, as leading speaker. It is such meet- 
ings as this, which was held in the Leicester Public 
Library, that help librarians and others to realize 
that a library's proper work is not confined to the 
mere custody and classification and circulation of 
books. 



THE NEW LAUREATE, Dr. Robert Bridges, is not 
one of those generally named by the wise prophets 
who thought themselves able to reduce the list of 
likely candidates to four, or three, or perhaps two, or 
even one. But his being a "dark horse" is by no 
means in his disfavor; and the fact that he has 



courted the Muse in a modest, unostentatious man- 
ner, as a relief and recreation after the exacting 
demands of medical practice, inclines one to think 
well of him and to hope for good things from his pen 
in the future. Born October 23, 1844, he assumes the 
laureateship at a mature age, as did his immediate 
predecessor. An Etonian and Oxonian, he studied 
medicine at St. Bartholomew's, London, and was 
afterward connected with a number of hospitals, 
but retired in 1882 to the more congenial atmos- 
phere of his library and study, where he wrote a 
succession of plays, poems, and essays, some of 
which were privately printed, and others publicly 
offered to the world; but no book of his, so far as 
we know, has ever joined the clamorous company 
of best-sellers. The names of a few of his works 
will serve as some indication of their quality and 
partly explain their exemption from a perhaps unde- 
sired popularity. Essays on Milton's prosody and 
Keats's poetry early came from his pen, as also a 
number of short poems; and among his plays we 
note such classical titles as "Nero," in two parts, 
"Ulysses," "Achilles in Scyros," "The Feast of 
Bacchus," and "Demeter: a Masque." The Yat- 
tendon Hymnal " also appears in the list of his pro- 
ductions, indicating in him a turn for sacred poetry. 
Commended by the critics for his refinement, deli- 
cacy, restraint, purity, and other merits, he gives 
promise of adorning the position to which a discern- 
ing government has appointed him. 

THE ART OF ENTICING THE READER TO THE 

PUBLIC LIBRARY is now as sedulously studied and 
practiced as was formerly the art of repelling him 
and of keeping the books intact, each in its sacredly 
fixed location on the shelf. From a letter of invi- 
tation sent out by the librarian of the Valparaiso 
(Indiana) Public Library to suburban citizens, and 
printed in the current Report of the Indiana Public 
Library Commission, we quote the concluding para- 
graph. "When you are in town, drop in at the 
library; you will find it a comfortable place in 
which to spend a pleasant hour. Perhaps you may 
have some suggestions to offer. I shall be very glad 
to hear them and will give them careful considera- 
tion. If you do not have time to come to the library, 
let us know your wants through the teachers or your 
boys and girls any way that will help us to give 
you the best possible service, for that is what we 
are striving to do. Yours for a successful library 
year, Bertha Joel, Librarian." In order to meet the 
reluctant or over-occupied library patron half-way, 
and even three-quarters or four-fifths way, the estab- 
lishment of branches and deposit stations is going 
on all over Indiana, as in many other parts of the 
country. "Sometimes the district school-house is 
the branch library building, and the teacher or some

as branch librarian. Churches, country stores, and 
post-offices are all used in some parts of the State 
as library centres, and in this way the public library 
is brought to the very doors of the country people." 



THE AMATEUR ELEMENT IN GREAT ART, the f resh 

enthusiasm, the delight in execution, the tendency 
even of zeal to outstrip knowledge this has been 
remarked often enough, and is emphasized again 
by Mr. Arnold Bennett in his essay on "Writing 
Novels," which occupies the leading place among 
the articles printed in the June " English Review." 
After telling us that " the novelist is he who, having 
seen life, and being so excited by it that he absolutely 
must transmit the vision to others, chooses narrative 
fiction as the liveliest vehicle for the relief of his 
feelings," and that "he differs from most artists in 
this that what most chiefly strikes him is the 
indefinable humanness of human nature, the large 
general manner of existing," Mr. Bennett continues 
his discourse on the novelist's attributes and char- 
acteristics, and says among other things : " I begin 
to think that great writers of fiction are by the mys- 
terious nature of their art ordained to be 'amateurs.' 
There may be something of the amateur in all great 
artists. I do not know why it should be so, unless 
because, in the exuberance of their sense of power, 
they are impatient of the exactitudes of systematic 
study and the mere bother of repeated attempts to 
arrive at a minor perfection. Assuredly no great 
artist was ever a profound scholar. The great artist 
has other ends to achieve." Of course it would not 
be very difficult to name a few erudite artists, but 
their erudition has always been subordinate to their 
art ; and the great artist, literary or other, if he is 
to be splendidly productive, must be the amateur, 
the " lover," of his self-imposed task. This whole 
subject, however, has already been skilfully treated 
by Mr. Bliss Perry in his essay on "The Amateur 
Spirit." . . . 

HOOSIER READERS AND WHAT THEY READ are 

told about, with other interesting information, in 
the "Seventh Biennial Report of the Public Library 
Commission of Indiana." The progress of the 
library movement in that State is graphically pre- 
sented by means of diagrams and a map, and two 
new Carnegie buildings are pictured in full-page 
illustrations. Indiana now has one hundred and 
forty-five public libraries, of which twenty have come 
into being since the issue of the last Report; but 
eleven of her ninety-two counties still appear on the 
Commission's map in black, to denote their benighted 
condition in respect to libraries. One hundred and 
six public library buildings, seventeen of them com- 
pleted or begun in the last two years, and sixteen 
presented by Mr. Carnegie, are now scattered over 
the State. Especially interesting is the account given 
of libraries in State institutions, whence it appears 
that in no other libraries can a little money and a 
little expert assistance be made to contribute so 
greatly to the benefit of the readers. At the bottom 



of a diagrammatic presentation of this truth it is 
asserted that "with the same number of volumes, 
one-third the income, and fourteen per cent, of the 
population, the Indiana Reformatory library circu- 
lates five times as many books as a good public 
library." Lack of funds for maintenance, and the 
want of trained librarians, are the chief causes of 
the present failure of institutional libraries to attain 
the highest degree of usefulness. 

PROFESSOR WOODBERRY'S PHI BETA KAPPA 
POEM formed not the least memorable feature of 
the late Harvard commencement. It was a noble 
tribute to the memory of Charles Eliot Norton, 
whose death occurred nearly five years ago. The 
poem, "In Memoriam: Charles Eliot Norton," is 
now published under the poet's copyright, which we 
venture to violate to the extent of a brief quotation 
finely descriptive of Professor Norton's refinement 
and grace of manner. After some personal remi- 
niscence, in which he refers to himself as Norton's 
"firstling charge, boy -leader of the host of those 
who followed in the after-time," the writer thus, in 
part, depicts the proprietor of Shady Hill: 

" A grave demeanor masked his solitude, 
Like the dark pines of his seignorial wood; 
But there \vithin was hid how warm a hearth 
Hospitable, and bright with children's mirth. 
How many thence recall his social grace, 
t> The genial welcome beaming from his face, 

The shy embarrassment of his good-will 
Chafing against the forms that held it still; 
Or, in more private hours, the high discourse, 
With soft persuasion veiling moral force ; 
The reticent mouth, the sweet reserved style ; 
Something unsaid still lingered in his smile ; 
For more he felt than ever he expressed, 
Then silent most when in his conscious breast 
Most intimate with some long-cherished guest."

bibliographic lists, reports, announcements, news 
items, and other kindred matter in the current issue

ographical Society of America." Especially to be 
noted are the list of Brooklyn publications in the 
years 1799-1820, and that of current American 
bibliographical publications. Also noteworthy is the 
announcement of Mr. William Abbatt's purpose to 
issue, as a monthly supplement to his magazine of 
history, a periodical to be entitled "The Interna- 
tional Notes and Queries," and to be edited by Mr. 
Eugene F. McPike, 135 Park Row, Chicago. It 
will be obtainable separately, if desired, at $2.25 a 
year, subscriptions to be sent to Mr. Abbatt, 410 
E. 32d St., New York. Interchange of useful in- 
formation will be the purpose of the new periodical, 
and it hopes to facilitate intercommunication be- 
tween reference librarians and others engaged in 
research. The London publication of similar name 
and character is said to have more than eleven hun- 
dred constant contributors, and the projectors of the 
new journal look for a like support.

JOHST BlGEJLOW IN HIS PRIME.* 

Plutarch tells us of Pericles that, " following 
the dictates of enthusiasm and absorbed in 
sublime inquiries," he became engrossed in 
questions of public concern and gave to his 
paternal estate and private money matters only 
such attention as sufficed to insure him against 
pecuniary embarrassments, and brought the 
management of his property " into such a method 
as was very easy at the same time that it was 
exact." In much the same way the late John 
Bigelow, after he had reached the prime of his 
powers, refused to be further troubled with 
the question of money- getting, but, having 
already acquired a modest competence, gave his 
time and thought to matters of larger interest 
and served his country and his generation with 
works better suited to his tastes and more 
worthy of his energies than any pursuit of 
private fortune. 

In the fourth and fifth volumes of his " Retro- 
spections of an Active Life," issued under the 
editorship of his son, Major John Bigelow, we 
have a near view of the famous diplomat and 
publicist, scholar, writer, and reformer, in the 
full maturity of his varied powers, and showing 
himself most genially in the mellowness of his 
sixth and seventh decades. As in the earlier vol- 
umes, diaries and correspondence are copiously 
drawn upon, with such insertion of narrative and 
comment as is necessary to round out the story. 
Among the noteworthy contents of the two 
rich volumes, mention may be made of Mr. 
Bigelow's discovery and purchase of the original 
manuscript of the Franklin autobiography, his 
brief editorship of the New York "Times," his 
memories of Dickens, Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
PreHyacinthe, Horace Greeley,and many other 
celebrities of his time, his visits to Europe and 
comments on current European events, including 
the Franco-German War and the fall of Napoleon 
III., and his public services at home in various 
capacities. The period covered by the two 
volumes extends from 1867 to 1879, leaving 
the last thirty-two years of Mr. Bigelow's life to 
have their story told in the letters, diaries, and 
other literary remains that are still unedited, 
but, as the editor says, "may be utilized in the 
preparation of future publications." 

For the first time the whole history of the

York : Doubleday, Page & Co. 



finding and purchase of the Franklin auto- 
biography, and of a series of his letters and 
the original Duplessis portrait, is given to the 
public, in minute and often amusing detail, in 
the early pages of Mr. Bigelow's fourth volume. 
The price he paid for the treasure was twenty- 
five thousand francs, the owners, Georges and 
Paul de Senarmont, being not at all eager to 
part with these interesting relics. To the friendly 
offices of William H. Huntington, at that time 
Paris correspondent of the New York " Tribune," 
the American purchaser was considerably in- 
debted for the successful transaction of the 
business. Letters between the buyer and his 
agent show the latter to have been a wit and 
humorist, and also reveal Mr. Bigelow himself 
in the rather unfamiliar role of an indulger in 
pleasantries. Huntington describes with much 
playfulness his first call on Georges deSenarmont, 
and the "gentle domestic aperient" by whom 
his passage through ante-room to reception- 
room was "lubricated" and he was eased of his 
card and letter of introduction "in the most 
soothing manner." To this letter the reply, 
written in London, was in part as follows : 

" Your promptness and zeal in the execution of my 
commission are appreciated. I congratulate you upon 
the pleasant passage which Mr. de Senarmont's domestic 
aperient secured you though I may he called upon to 
indemnify two of my English friends for a set of buttons 
snapped off from their waistcoats through laughing at 
the incident in yr note which described that particular 
stage of your good fortune. ... I do not suppose I 
should ever get my money back, and yet I feel that I 
should derive some satisfaction from being the actual 
proprietor of old Benny's story of his life. ... I pro- 
pose to commit myself to the oceano dissodabili, as your 
friend Mr. Flaccus terms the waste of waters between 
Liverpool and Yankeedom, on the 30th inst. . . . What- 
ever you decide to do or to leave undone will be sure 
of the approval of your humble servant." 

The " Franklinicnacs," as Huntington jocosely 
and a trifle contemptuously called the valuable 
objects of his friend's quest, were promptly 
secured by him and sent to London, where they 
arrived just in time to be carried off in glad 
triumph to America by the returning traveller 
and retired minister. This was at the end of 
January, 1867. Ten months later occurred an 
"Atlantic" dinner in Boston, at which Mr. 
Bigelow sat as guest in the distinguished com- 
pany of Emerson, Lowell, Norton, Whipple, 
Longfellow, the two R. H. Danas, father and 
son, James T. Fields, Dr. Holmes, Dickens, and 
others. Longfellow presided, in the absence of 
Agassiz, who was president of the club ; and a 
part of the description of the animated proceed- 
ings that attended the eating and drinking will 
here be in place.

" Holmes spoke with great emotion of the persistent 
attacks of the Nation upon The Guardian Angel, begin- 
ning with the first number. Had the writer awaited 
the completion of the work, he said, he would not have 
minded it; but his conduct, Holmes said, could only be 
compared to the brutality of kicking a woman with child 
every week, in the belly. He thinks the writer to be a 
foreigner who has an idea that he may show his smart- 
ness to advantage at the Doctor's expense. I told him 
I feared he attached too much importance to the criti- 
cisms of books, which were read by very few persons 
after all. He thought he had gotten over it, but I saw 
he had not. 

" Dickens was asked by Holmes if he had ever had 
his head examined by a phrenologist. ' Oh, yes,' he said, 
' frequently ' ; and he said he had faith in the science, if 
only for the prominence of the bump of order in his 
head. ' For,' said he, ' I never can set myself down to 
work till I have been all over my house and seen every- 
thing in its place. It is simply impossible for me to 
write till I have gone through that preliminary. I do 
it now,' said he, ' every day.' " 

In the summer and early autumn of 1869 
occurred Mr. Bigelow's brief editorship of the 
New York " Times," which he conducted in such 
a manner that its proprietors became alarmed 
lest he " was elevating the standard of the paper 
too high for New York." Consequently the 
editorial chair was vacated with cheerful readi- 
ness by its too idealistic incumbent, who rejoiced 
to resume his quiet home life and once more dedi- 
cate the usual number of night hours to sleep. 
Here is a significant paragraph on this episode : 

" Because I had been an ardent Republican when the 
preservation of the Union was the dominating issue of 
the new party which had taken that name, and during 
my service abroad had enjoyed the confidence of Mr. 
Seward and the Republican leaders in Congress, the 
proprietors of the paper doubtless assumed that I would 
edit the Times on the political lines on which it had 
been edited by Mr. Raymond. President Grant himself 
called upon me to talk about the course of the Times, 
and appeared to be entirely satisfied with it. I took 
occasion, however, in the course of our interview to tell 
him that as the war was over and the dangers of dis- 
union were disposed of, it seemed to me to be his first 
duty to ask Congress to repeal the War Tariff for which 
there was no longer any excuse. His reply surprised 
me. <Oh,' said he, 'we can't do anything of that kind.' 
And he uttered it with so much confidence that I saw 
any argument with him about it would be wasted. Hav- 
ing known of Grant only as a military man, and that 
so far as he had any political principles he had been a 
Democrat, the promptness with which he rejected any 
thought of a reduction of the war tariff satisfied me that 
the protectionists had already been ploughing with the 
Whig contingent's heifer." 

Mr. Bigelow's intensity of feeling on the 
third-term question appears in a letter of his to 
Whitelaw Reid in the summer of 1875, when 
the possible continuance of Grant in office for 
another four years was exciting animated debate. 
Recent events and certain future possibilities 



give additional interest to the sentiments so 
emphatically expressed in the following: 

" The two-term tradition derives all its force and vigor 
from the respect entertained in this country for the privi- 
lege we enjoy of changing our executive at convenient 
intervals and our hereditary aversion to dynastic au- 
thority. It means that or it means nothing. Whoever 
assists in or connives at breaking down that tradition 
assists in and connives at the transformation of our 
government from a republic to a monarchy, and that by 
the terms of the Constitution is treason; and our fathers 
saw fit to declare that traitors and those who abetted 
them were worthy of death not the presidency." 

More follows in the same strain, only intensified. 
From the Paris diary of 1877 we take a passage 
showing Victor Hugo in a characteristic attitude: 

" When Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, was here, 
he sent a message that he would be glad to see Mr. Hugo. 
Hugo replied that he was much obliged to his Majesty, 
but that he made no visits. The Emperor sent a mes- 
senger the second time to know whether, if he called 
first on V. Hugo, the poet would return his visit. Hugo 
replied that he could not depart from his rule; that his 
Majesty the King of Bavaria had done him the honor to 
visit him, and that he had not returned his visit, and it 
was therefore only more difficult to make an exception, 
however agreeable it might be to do so, in the case of 
his Majesty. The Emperor sent again to know if they 
could not meet somewhere at Versailles during the 
session of the Senate of which Hugo was a member. 
Hugo saw no difficulty about that, and therefore they 
did meet in one of the committee rooms, and ' had a 
charming time.' " 

Permission was graciously accorded by the poet 
to the potentate to join him at dinner some day 
in his own house, and there everything seems to 
have gone pleasantly. When Hugo's son entered 
and was bidden by his father to "salute his 
Majesty," the latter replied, "No, there is but 
one Majesty here, and he sits there " pointing 
to his host; all which, says the diarist, was 
highly satisfactory to everyone concerned. 

These later volumes have a wealth of interest, 
and a lightness of touch in narrative and com- 
ment, that make them even better reading than 
the earlier ones. Portraits and other illustra- 
tions are interspersed, and a full index (not 
faultlessly accurate, which would have been 
almost too much to expect) to the entire work 
is appended. The continuation of the " Retro- 
spections," from Mr. Bigelow's later diaries 
and correspondence, is a consummation to be 

hoped for. p ERCY R BlCKNELL.

THE VARIORUM "JULIUS 

The publication of another volume of the 
Variorum Shakespeare marks an important step 
towards the completion of a great and noble 
undertaking. The amount of work involved in 
the preparation of such a volume can scarcely 
be realized by one who has not sometime at- 
tempted such a task. The careful collation of 
the four Folios, the comparison of the texts of 
all the more important editions of this play since 
the time of Rowe, the thorough study of the 
poet's originals and of the history of the times 
of the protagonist of the drama, the investiga- 
tion of possible sources for material contained 
in the play, the perusal of the letters of Caesar's 
contemporaries for light on certain incidents, 
the critical study of the text itself and of the 
different interpretations by the poet's numerous 
editors and commentators, the selection of crit- 
ical and aesthetic commentaries from the vast 
mass of French, German, and English com- 
mentary published during the past two hundred 
years, the study of other plays dealing with 
Julius Caesar, the tracing of all sorts of obscure 
references to their sources, the verification of 
the editors' comments, etc., are all so well 
done and, withal, so modestly that we cannot 
withold our admiration and gratitude for the 
present editor. Considering how well the work 
has been done as a whole, it is a pity to be 
compelled to pick flaws in it ; but we cannot 
help judging this work by the high standard set 
for us by the late and universally beloved Dr. 
Furness, the most genial (in the German as in 
the English sense of this word), scholarly, and 
witty editor that ever shed light on the works 
of Shakespeare. The errors of the present 
editor, such as they are, can easily be remedied, 
and then his future work will come very near 
to that perfection aimed at by his illustrious 
predecessor. 

The most important task of the editor of this 
volume, I take it, was the faithful reproduction 
of the Folio text, with all its peculiarities of 
capitalization, punctuation, italicization, line dis- 
placement, word and letter displacement, type 
peculiarities, etc. In this task he has failed, 
owing to careless proof-reading. For the benefit 
of those who own copies of the work in hand, I 
append the following list of the more important 
of these errors. In v. 5. 50, a comma is omitted 
after " labour'd," and in v. 5. 83, a superfluous 

* THE TRAGEDIE OF JULIUS CAESAR. By William Shake- 
speare. Variorum edition. Edited by Horace Howard 
Furness, Jr. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. 



comma is inserted after " onely "; in iv. 2. 31, 
deceitful should be deceitfull ; in iv. 3. 25, 
bribes should be Bribes ; in iv. 3. 31, endure 
should be indure; in iv. 3. 66, Bru should be 
Brut ; in iv. 3. 10, the period after " Palme " 
should be a comma; in iv. 3. 275, Tet should 
be Tit ; in 1. 290 of the same scene plesaure 
should be pleasure, and in 1. 309 a comma 
ought to follow Musicke. The substitution of 
fight for sight in v. 3. 86 is very bad. In 
v. 5. 49, eyes is misprinted eyer, and in v. 5. 
18 the lozenge- shaped period after " grief e " 
should be a comma. In ii. 2. 100, we find 
Straines instead of Staines, and in ii. 4. 5, 
thy errand instead of my errand ; in i. 2. 228, 
than should be then; a comma should be in- 
serted after swore (i. 3. 26), after pale (i. 3. 
68), and after Ccesar (iii. 1. 237) ; the period 
after Confines (iii. 1. 302) should be replaced 
by a comma ; a period should not follow course 
(i. 2. 10). In i. 3. 93 And is misprinted Are, 
and in i. 3. 103 walls should be Walls. The 
reader must be cautioned, however, that some 
of these " errors " may be peculiarities of Mr. 
Furness's Folio. My study is based on the 
Sidney Lee facsimile of the Chatsworth Folio. 
In my copy of the Folio there is no sign of a 
hyphen between strange and disposed in i. 3. 
35, and in iii. 2. 183 I find Nerny, not Neruij. 
Occasionally the Variorum emphasizes a partic- 
ular capital letter which is not so emphasized 
in the original ; very often it fails to reproduce 
the very heavy and clumsy periods of the Folio 
printer, and in some fifteen or eighteen instances 
it fails to reproduce the peculiar double-length 
capital C which elsewhere is reproduced. So, 
too, the displacements of single letters are not 
always copied. We would not call attention to 
these peculiarities were it not the editor's pur- 
pose to give an exact reproduction of the orig- 
inal. Other misprints mar the book throughout. 
On p. vii. of the preface, seeing is misprinted 
seemg ; on p. 151 a verse from "Romeo and 
Juliet" is ruined by a superfluous comma, etc. 
How trustworthy a guide the editor is to the 
texts of his predecessors I can judge only from 
the way he has dealt with Rolfe's revised edition 
of this play, the only one I have taken the 
trouble to examine. Rolfe is not quoted every 
time he departs from the generally accepted 
text, nor are the readings peculiar to his text 
recorded. In i. 2. 304, both Craik and Rolfe 
print my for mine, in iii. 1. 288 Rolfe reads 
hands for hand, in iii. 2. 99 ransom for ran- 
soms, in v. 4. 5, of for to (!), in v. 5. 79, ordered 
for ordered, in i. 2. 280, my for mine, in iv. 1.

47, answered for answered, etc., but these are 
not noted by Mr. Furness. 

In an edition of this kind it is always a 
difficult question to determine what to give and 
what to omit. It is impossible to suit all tastes. 
The habit of referring to the New English Dic- 
tionary for the interpretation of obscurities is, 
of course, a very good one. It brings home to 
the reader the fact that the understanding of 
what Shakespeare wrote depends very largely 
upon a knowledge of the peculiarities of the 
language of his day, that Elizabethan English is 
a wholly different thing from modern English, 
and that the poet's linguistic peculiarities were 
the peculiarities of his age. But in the present 
volume this tendency is somewhat overdone. A 
student of a variorum edition is usually too far 
advanced to need to be reminded that proof 
means experience, knot group, griefs grievances, 
envious malicious, fire enkindle, regard heed, 
in into, warn summon, etc. These are now 
commonplaces of Shakespeare study that even 
undergraduates are supposed to know. If an 
editor goes in for this sort of thing he ought to 
define every word not employed in its modern 
sense. If in the clause "since the quarrel will 
bear no color for the thing he is" the word 
"quarrel" is defined, why is not the word 
"color" defined? So in the sentence "be not 
jealous on me" on (of) is defined, but jealous 
(mistrustful) is not! At times the editor de- 
fines words, e.g. exhalations, that have their 
modern meaning or very nearly so. A variorum 
edition is not supposed to supersede the dic- 
tionary. And if Mr. Furness thinks it neces- 
sary to mark certain definitions (e.g. quarrel) 
as obsolete, why does he not give us this infor- 
mation in other instances, e.g. degree (p. 77)? 

On the whole there is a tendency to super- 
fluous defining, paraphrasing, and commenting. 
No reader of Shakespeare needs be told that 
"by Caesar and by you" means "beside Caesar 
and at your hands," or that "in his way that 
comes," means "in the way of him that comes," 
etc. So some of the quotations from Appian 
(e.g. that on p. 167), from Craik (on the word 
orchard], etc., are not necessary and do not 
tend to illuminate the poet. To compensate 
for this it may be mentioned as a great relief 
not to find in this volume constant references to 
monosyllables used as dissyllables, trisyllables 
as quadrisyllables, etc. In only one instance 
of this kind has the editor sinned. On p. 37, 
we are referred to Walker for evidence that 
creature is often pronounced as a trisyllable. 
Considering that the word is not so pronounced 



anywhere in this play, why encumber the book 
with unnecessary information, and that infor- 
mation of such a trivial sort? So, too, I con- 
sider it a fault to remind the reader in some 
half-dozen passages in which where occurs as a 
contraction for whether of that fact, and to refer 
him to Abbott or to Walker, especially as the 
passages in question never leave any doubt as 
to the fact. 

The reproduction of the conventional coat-of- 
arms on the cover of this volume is an absurdity. 
That coat-of-arms is no more Shakespeare's 
"coat" than it is that of the King of England. 
At the cost of about one dollar the publishers 
could have a cut made of the arms assigned to 
the poet by the College of Arms in 1596 and 
carved on his Stratford monument. To depict 
the Shakespeare coat on the covers would be 
some sense, but to depict what is there repro- 
duced is not. Another matter that should have 
received more attention is the Index. The mass 
of extremely valuable and interesting informa- 
tion stored up in this volume is deserving of and 
calls for a good Index. Dr. Rolfe, for example, 
is quoted several times in the volume; yet his 
name does not occur in the Index. The pagi- 
nation of the Folio ought to have been repro- 
duced, too, I think. 

If we turn from what may be called the 
mechanical aspect of the editorial work to the 
personal we find much to praise and, to admire. 
The editor's keen commonsense, his scientific 
mental habit, his shrewdness, his freedom from 
affectation and mysticism, the extent of his 
knowledge, and the range of his literary inter- 
ests, have resulted in a large body of notes which 
are of the greatest value to the student. His 
quotations from Ferrero, Cicero, and Plutarch 
are always suggestive and informing. His eye 
is keen in the detection of the errors and over- 
sights of his predecessors. He is keen in his 
comments on the far-fetched criticisms of men 
like Moulton, etc. The notes that particularly 
pleased me are those on Jonson's enmity to 
Shakespeare; on the words "Pardon, Caesar; 
Caesar, pardon"; on Statillius (p. 270); on 
Caesar's fictitious mantle ; on the alliteration in 
iii. 1. 196; on the phrase "the manner of it" 
(p. 49); on the Senatus-consulta (p. 168); and 
on the effect of the monosyllables in iii. 1. 
155-156. The attempted vindication of Brutus 
from the charge of having lied to Messala is 
not, me judice, successful. It is so easy to take 
refuge in the theory of a corrupted text that 
every such attempt must be regarded with sus- 
picion. The scene with Messala cannot possibly 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



47 



be omitted without woefully marring the scene. 
We may be sure there is good psychological 
reason for Brutus's conduct. Brutus has every- 
where imposed on his critics by the high valu- 
ation he sets on himself, in other words, by his 
own blindness to his weaknesses. Brutus never 
admits or even thinks that he conspired against 
the life of his benefactor and friend because he 
was jealous of him and his growing power. He 
first decides that "it must be by his (Caesar's) 
death" and then proceeds to find reasons for his 
determination. He rationalizes his unconscious 
motives, a disciple of the new (Freudian) psy- 
chology would say. That the reasons he as- 
signs to himself in ii. 1. are not the true ones is 
evident from the fact that in his quarrel with 
Cassius he assigns a wholly different reason. 
And when a man assigns different reasons for 
his acts we may be sure that neither is the true 
one. It is exactly as with Hamlet's reasons for 
procrastination and lago's reasons for conspir- 
ing against Othello. 

The "new psychology" might also very well 
be invoked to explain one or two points in the 
portrayal of Caesar. It has long been noted, and 
Mr. Furness has some very interesting comments 
on it, that Shakespeare represents Caesar as 
being "temporarily" (?) deaf after his epileptic 
fit. Several explanations of this have been 
given, that it is only a touch of vivid por- 
traiture, that it is a symbol of Caesar's obstinacy 
and refusal to heed the warnings, that it is not 
to be taken literally, etc. No one, as far as I am 
aware, has ever thought of asking why Shake- 
speare departs from Plutarch in subjecting 
Csesar to an epileptic fit at the moment of the 
populace's disapproval of his crowning. So, too, 
according to Plutarch, Caesar's tearing open his 
doublet collar and offering his throat to be cut 
happened on another occasion, among his friends 
and in his own house. Nothing in all Shake- 
speare attests more convincingly the poet's mar- 
vellous insight into the workings of the human 
soul than this incident. Shakespeare shows us 
in his unconscious way that Caesar really never 
suffered from genuine epilepsy. Caesar's falling 
sickness came on late in life, Plutarch tells us, 
and the attacks occurred only after great emo- 
tional excitement. In the light of Freud's rev- 
elations we may say that Caesar suffered from a 
form of nervous disease called a " psychoneuro- 
sis,"the manifestations of which are determined 
by unconscious causes. From Stekel we learn 
that in cases of hysterical epilepsy the exciting 
cause of the attack is an unconscious criminal 
impulse. To prevent this impulse from becoming 



conscious the individual falls into a fit (which 
gives vent to the repressed energy) and loses 
consciousness. Caesar's attack manifests his 
covetous desire of becoming King and his hatred 
of the people for their disapproval of Antony's 
action. This is the meaning of the convulsion 
and what followed; not that it shows that Caesar's 
fortune is waning or that the gods, too, conspire 
against him. Let us not resort to the supernat- 
ural when the psychological will serve. Caesar's 
offer of his throat to the rabble and his fear that 
he may have said something amiss show what 
was in his mind before he fell. For the benefit 
of those who are not physicians it may be said 
that the reasons for not regarding Caesar's at- 
tack as genuine epilepsy are the following: the 
attack occurred by day; it was preceded by 
emotional excitement ; his loss of consciousness 
was not complete; he recovered consciousness 
very quickly and knew what had happened ; his 
mind was perfectly clear after the convulsion ; 
he was deaf (or deafened) on the left ear; his 
attacks began late in life; he was superstitious 
"of late" and presented many paranoiac ten- 
dencies. That the deafness was on the left side 
becomes significant when we bear in mind that 
in the language of the unconscious the left is 
the wrong, the sinful, the criminal. 

One is disappointed to find so acute a 
scholar as Mr. Furness reproducing all the 
futile discussion (pp. 19 and 41) as to the 
Shakesperean pronunciation of "Rome" and 
" room." Who can doubt that a poet and a wit 
would force the pronunciation of any word a little 
for the sake of a rhyme or a word-play ? While 
on the subject of pronunciation, it is somewhat 
surprising that the editor does not inform us 
how Elizabethans pronounced the word " spirit " 
as a monosyllable, whether " spir't " or 
"sprit." (Cf. p. 40.) I am inclined to think 
that the word was often pronounced " spreet," 
and often so printed. 

On p. 44 Mr. Furness reproduces Walker's 
note on the frequency of the interpolation of an 
s at the end of a word as being due to some 
peculiarity of Shakespeare's handwriting. If we 
had an authentic and undoubted specimen of 
the poet's handwriting this matter would be 
easily settled. But the only thing in this kind 
that we have is a portion of the MS. play of 
"Sir Thomas Moore " preserved in the British 
Museum, which it is impossible to prove to be 
a genuine MS. from the poet's hand, much as 
we may believe it is. This MS. and all other 
Elizabethan manuscripts show two distinct 
varieties of final s which cannot be mistaken 



48 



THE DIAL 



[July 16 



for anything else; nor is there any final char- 
acter in it or them that in any way resembles a 
final s. The same is also true of the poet's will, 
which some believe to be holographic. The 
dramatist's genuine signatures show no final 
stroke that could be mistaken for a final s. For 
which reasons I do not believe that the inter- 
polated final s originated in some peculiarity of 
Shakespeare's handwriting. 

On p. 237 Mr. Furness falls into a peculiar 
error which is very unusual for him. In con- 
nection with the vanishing of Caesar's ghost after 
Brutus had taken heart, he refers to " Macbeth" 
for an illustration of "a similar example of 
an effort of will overcoming an hallucination." 
But the two incidents are not at all alike. 
Macbeth takes heart only after the Ghost of 
Banquo vanished ; his will had nothing to do 
with it. Witness his own words : " Why, so ; 
being gone I am a man again." Psychologically 
the difference is very great. In "Macbeth" 
the Ghost is real, objective; in this play the 
Ghost is subjective, the projection of Brutus's 
guilty conscience. 

It is somewhat surprising to find Mr. Furness, 
who is so alert in the detection of fine tonal 
effects, failing to point out the effectiveness of 
the words " And kill him in the shell." The 
shortness of the line had received its comment, 
but no one, as far as I know, has pointed out 
how these monosyllabic words with their three 
short is and two short e's produce an effect as 
if the speaker were delivering a fatal blow. 
Shakespeare was very happy in the production 
of such effects, in adapting sound to sense ; 
and every instance of it ought to be pointed 
out. Nothing finer in this kind has ever been 
produced than when King Lear pronounces 
his own doom: "So be my grave my peace as 
here I give her father's heart from her." 

This review having already outgrown my 
intention I shall comment only on two or three 
other matters of minor nature. Brutus's " I do 
know you well" (iv. 2. 50) does not mean 
"since we are both intimate friends." It means, 
"I know how excitable, rash, hot-tempered, 
and choleric you are." That is why he says, 
" Cassius, be content ; speak your griefs softly." 
Mr. Furness's emendation of "increasing" for 
" encreaseth " is unnecessarily " botching Shake- 
speare," as Professor Liddell would say. The 
passage (iv. 3. 246) is perfectly clear as it is, 
and no one has ever found any difficulty with 
it. Nor can I receive favorably Walker's sugges- 
tion (p. 134) that we stress the word "of " in the 
verse, " He draws Marc Antony out of the way." 



Imagine, if you can, any actor reading the line 
that way ! Nor do I agree with Mr. Furness in 
thinking that Brutus's speech (i. 2. 26) would 
read well if read, " A soothsayer bids beware," 
etc. The cacophony is harsh, and the meaning 
of the sentence is ruined. 

On the whole, the volume before us is one of 
the best editions of this play that has ever been 
published, and a worthy fellow to its predeces- 
sors in the " Furness Variorum Shakespeare."

JAPANESE COLOR-PRINTS.* 



As year by year the circle widens of those 
who are familiar with the exquisite fascinations 
of the finer Japanese prints, there are produced 
occasional volumes of a quality that would have 
been impossible twenty-five years ago, when 
neither adequate data about the prints nor 
adequate processes of color-reproduction were 
available. Nowadays the reader, however remote 
he may be from the great print-collections, may 
have at his command trustworthy information 
regarding the artists and a true impression of 
the beauty of the prints themselves. The books 
of Fenollosa, von Seidlitz, and the great illus- 
trated catalogues of the exhibitions at the 
Musee des Arts Decoratifs issued annually in 
Paris, have all contributed to this service. And 
now Mr. Frederick William Gookin, whom one 
may regard as the doyen of Japanese print 
lovers in America, has produced, in his "Japan- 
ese Colour-Prints and their Designers," a vol- 
ume that will find a place beside the finest of 
its predecessors. 

The magnificent colored illustrations of the 
volume catch one's eye first; and, unlike ordinary 
illustrations, they have a place of high import- 
ance in the total scheme of the book. People 
in general do not realize how difficult it is even 
to see, and how almost impossible it is to acquire, 
the really fine prints, the works that have 
given this field of art its high and just fame. 
The finest prints are widely scattered, as a rule, 
in the hands of private collectors; and these 
fortunate possessors, though without known ex- 
ception they freely and gladly exhibit their 
treasures to all who ask, are not always easily

accessible to the general public. Japan itself 
is now almost bare of such works. One may go 
from one end of that country to the other, and 
though one search diligently, one will perhaps 
not see a single print of the quality of those 
which Mr. Gookin reproduces. And so the 
value of these reproductions, in accurate color, 
of twenty-five of the supreme masterpieces of 
color-print design, is not small; nor is the 
service to the public in reproducing them a 
superfluous one. The noble magnificence of 
Toyonobu and Kiyonaga, the exquisite color 
of Utamaro and Shuncho, the colossal force of 
Sharaku, the spirituality of Eishi, and the 
delicacy of Harunobu, all address the eye 
from these pages with a power so intense that 
the book may well serve as the Bible of those 
missionaries who go forth to convert the world 
to the religion of Japanese prints. 

The history of the art of which these prints 
are the product is one of singular interest, and, 
until comparatively recently, of great obscurity. 
Mr. Gookin reviews, with insight, judgment, 
and a fine sense of perspective, its curiously 
brief course. This Ukiyoe, or Popular School, 
taking its rise, like a small stream, among the 
mountains of that older aristocratic art which 
Japan acquired from ancient China, began, at 
the end of the sixteenth century, in the time 
of the Tokugawa Shoguns, to swell into a broad 
river of gay and democratic artistic activity. 
The actor, the courtesan, the dancer, the man in 
the street, all began to find a place in an art 
that had hitherto been the select retreat of 
devotees of abstruse poetic allusion, venerable 
academic tradition, and almost incredible aes- 
thetic refinements. In a people fundamentally 
inartistic, like our own, the result of this swing 
toward the mob would have been a crude vulgar- 
ization. In the Japanese, it resulted in such a 
rendering of the passing world of everyday 
vigorous life which is what the word " Ukiyo" 
means as still charms us with an immortal 
vitality and beauty. 

One of the channels, and in certain ways the 
most interesting one, into which the life-stream 
of this popular school flowed was that of the 
color-print. Mr. Gookin dates the production 
of the first color-print as the year 1742, and 
attributes the invention of it to Okumura 
Masanobu. This is debatable ground ; but on 
the debates we need not linger. Certain it is 
that from about this time on, year by year, and 
under many hands, the resources of the art 
expanded; until by 1765, in the work of 
Harunobu, practically all the possibilities of 



the technique had been realized. From then to 
the last decade of the century, the great period 
bloomed into amazing luxuriance ; until, when 
the brush fell from the hands of the supreme 
master Kiyonaga, there began that decline 
which, passing through intermediate stages of 
such hauntingly lovely decadence, was to lead to 
the point where the art died a dreadful death of 
coarseness, commonplaceness, and hideousness 
in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. 
After this, it came to life only once, for a brief 
renaissance in the hands of Hiroshige, the peer- 
less master of landscape ; and died again forever, 
with him, in 1858. 

To avoid confusion, it may be pointed out in 
passing that the word " Ukiyoe " is the identical 
term which most writers, including Mr. Gookin 
himself in his preface to Fenollosa's monumental 
catalogue of 1896, spell "Ukioye," and that 
"Eishi" is the same person who has been gen- 
erally known as "Yeishi." On the principle 
that the latest dicta of a prophet are the best, 
we follow the author's change of opinion in this 
matter. 

The wide first-hand experience and sound dis- 
criminative judgments that are at Mr. Gookin 's 
command in his review of Ukiyoe history make 
it easily the best brief account in existence. His 
description of the technique of color-printing is, 
also, more illuminating than that of any of his 
predecessors. Von Seidlitz's volume still re- 
mains the most comprehensive survey of the 
field ; but if one wished to give a layman a true 
and expressive picture of this region, and an 
alluring glimpse at the prints themselves in their 
authentic color, one would certainly choose this 
book as one's medium. For the more experi- 
enced student, so brief a book is bound to have 
gaps that arouse regret. When so vast a field 
is to be covered, omissions are unavoidable ; and 
probably no two people would agree as to what 
could most properly be omitted. One may 
therefore legitimately and pleasantly quarrel 
with Mr. Gookin for his decision to ignore 
such artists as Shunman, the inventor of never- 
equaled harmonies in gray; Toyohiro, whose 
aristocratic delicacy of design frequently takes 
him into a world which his more famous and 
more productive master Toyokuni was never 
privileged to enter; and Kitao Masanobu, a 
creator of noble figures touched sometimes with 
a rare visionary quality that even the great 
Kiyonaga seems in certain moods to lack. But 
these are small quarrels, after all ; and the omis- 
sions are fully accounted for by the necessity of 
compressing the material into a one-hour's lee- 



50

ture, for delivery before the Japan Society of 
New York. Further, one finds compensation 
in the fact that the book contains no allusion 
whatsoever to Kunisada, Kikumaro, Yeizan, 
Kuniyasu, Shunsen, and all that heterogeneous 
horde whose works defiled the second half of the 
nineteenth century, and whose histories encum- 
ber the pages of too many previous treatises. 

But on the other hand, one could wish that 
the author had faced a little more squarely the 
difficult, perhaps impossible, task of defining in 
words those elements of beauty in the prints 
which, though they make so sharp an appeal to 
the eye of the expert, are not always so obvious 
to the layman. One regrets a little that the 
author has not told us frankly what these prints 
mean to him, and disclosed to us his diagnosis 
of the springs of their enchantment. But per- 
haps the day has not yet come for such an inter- 
pretation . Certainly no writer has yet appeared 
to do for these artists what Walter Pater did 
for Botticelli, Leonardo, and Watteau, 
positively enriching with his own perception of 
beauty the paintings of which he writes, and 
opening to a wider public the secret byways of 
a subtle and sensitive mind's aesthetic experience 
in the country of loveliness. It will perhaps be 
said that these prints have a less definite spirit- 
ual content, and lend themselves less readily to 
such explorations. But I believe this is not true : 
the spiritual content may be more nebulous 
here, more implicit in line and mass and color, 
and less concerned with the subject treated ; but 
it exists, otherwise this would not be art. 
And to define it must be the ultimate aim of 
criticism. Toward such an expression, all pre- 
liminary work in this field must lead ; and even 
so finely expressive a book as the one before us 
will probably find its place ultimately with the 
treatises which, by sound scholarship and criti- 
cal justness, prepare the way for that spiritual 
interpretation of these designs which must some 
day be written. Or is this the biased view of a 
mere writer, of one who subconsciously wishes 
to reduce all the arts to the terms of the one 
he understands best ? Perhaps a painter would 
doubt the need, the value, the possibility of any 
such verbal rendering of another art. And yet 
one cannot refrain from hoping that some day 
Mr. Gookin will devote his rare equipment to 
the service of such a task. There are implica- 
tions in his writings leading one to conjecture 
that perhaps he already projects such an attempt. 

At any rate, the Japanese print itself has 
come to take a high and permanent place in the 
world of western aesthetic experience. As we 



look at such works, their very unfamiliarity of 
subject sets us free from our habitual preoccu- 
pation with mere theme, which is so great a 
curse to us in our approach to our own art. 
Where all is strange, and no sentimentality or 
interest of association enters to corrupt our 
feeling, we may see as in a vacuum, so to speak, 
the pure elements of artistic creation liberated 
from combination with elements of accidental 
and personal charm. For this reason, if for no 
other, the prints have a unique value to students 
of the fundamental principles of design. The 
finest specimens open to us new vistas of delight ; 
and even the poorest examples, if they date from 
the great period, have something to teach the 
westerner. But, as Mr. Gookin points out, the 
student primarily needs such familiarity with 
the rare works of the golden age as will lead 
him to turn quickly aside from the crude pro- 
ducts of an extreme later decadence and the 
miserable late impressions made in vast numbers 
from the worn-out blocks of Hiroshige. Such 
repulsive prints are very common, and constitute, 
in the minds of most people, the whole body of 
Japanese art. Small wonder that these people 
look upon the collector as a queer faddist who 
finds beauty in discord and deformity ! But 
anyone who desires to retain this unfortunate 
illusion should be wary enough not to look into 
Mr. Gookin's volume.

GEORGE ELIOT'S INNER LIFE.* 

A little work of distinct importance for gen- 
eral readers of George Eliot comes to us from 
England in humble guise. Says Professor C. H. 
Herford in his introductory note: "A book 
which is wholly occupied with the obscure pre- 
paratory years of a great writer, which closes 
with her first signal triumph, and ignores 
almost wholly the salient events of her later 
career, may appear to be a case of biography 
truncated, and truncated at the more interesting 
end. Yet to the student of literary origins," 
he adds, "the limited aim and scope of this 
essay will hardly need justification." Professor 
Herford seems to have in mind not so much 
the actual content of the work as its somewhat 
unfortunate title. "Early Life " does indeed 
suggest a narrow scope and large emphasis on 
" literary origins." But the book turns out to

York : Longmans, Green, & Co.

be a very good presentation of George Eliot's 
whole personality. It covers the first forty 
years of her life, and indicates, at the same 
time, the very few developments of any import- 
ance which occurred later. One wonders just 
what "salient events of her later career " (that 
is, the last twenty years of her life) Professor 
Herford had in mind assuming that salient 
events, in the case of an author, are those which 
either strongly illuminate his nature or affect 
him so nearly as to have an important result for 
his writings. 

Events of this quality, in George Eliot's case, 
were chiefly antecedent to "her first signal tri- 
umph," "Adam Bede" they were, indeed, the 
means of making that triumph possible. They 
are comprised, very roughly speaking, within 
three periods : first, the initial twenty years of 
quiet country life, during which the girl's mind 
was unconsciously accumulating the material 
of future novels; then the decade spent in the 
town of Coventry, with its congenial and liber- 
ating influences ; and finally, the early period 
of literary activity in London, which brought to 
bear on Marian Evans those external stimuli 
chief among them the affectionate appreciation 
of G. H. Lewes so necessary to stir into 
full activity her hesitant genius for narrative. 
When George Eliot finished "Adam Bede," 
she practically completed also her own inner 
development as an artist. By limiting itself to 
that development, Miss Deakin's book finds a 
place of its own between such sketchy biogra- 
phies of George Eliot as Miss Blind's and Leslie 
Stephen's on the one hand, and on the other 
hand Cross's Life and Letters with its dreary 
tracts of lifeless details. 

Within her chosen field, moreover, Miss 
Deakin is guided by an exceptionally sympa- 
thetic insight into her author's spiritual life. 
This sets her free from what may be called the 
" intellectual fallacy " in regard to George Eliot. 
" This woman author," remarks one who knew 
the late Professor Dowden in student days, 
"this woman author, with her chilly east wind of 
science and agnosticism, was a wintry frost to all 
of us, in those far-away days." * And as late as 
1909, Professor Hugh Walker pronounces that 
" George Eliot sat upon a solitary throne which 
few cared to approach," a somewhat strange 
statement considering the large sale of her 
books. The fact is that the mass of general 
readers, undiscriminatingly viewing George 
Eliot's art in toto, found her faults fairly easy 
to digest. Not so the critical. The generation 

* See THE DIAL, May 16, 1913, p. 405. 



of critics and biographers a little later than 
Dowden's was sufficiently liberated from Vic- 
torian romanticism to feel the essential warmth 
of George Eliot's view of life ; but not suffi- 
ciently to make due allowance for the over- 
intellectuality of her art. This fault of hers 
the unfortunate corollary of an intellectual 
quietude and precision recalling classic art and 
largely foreign to the age was harder to accept 
than Dickens's sentimentality and Thackeray's 
gossipy chatter, especially since it was not easy 
to reconcile with the sex of " this woman au- 
thor." Consequently the centre of her art and 
individuality, essentially feminine as it is, was 
somewhat obscured. 

Now, Miss Deakin obviously belongs to a 
generation which has been considerably influ- 
enced by George Meredith ; to whom, she re- 
marks, George Eliot is closely akin, " especially 
in her wide, human, understanding sympathy, 
and her mental attitude toward life." And it is 
apparent throughout the book that Miss Deakin 
is an admirer of her author's "this-worldliness." 
As a result she is inclined to over-estimate 
George Eliot's art, when this comes into ques- 
tion. But on the whole she avoids the critical 
standpoint, and keeps to her aim of dealing with 
the novelist's works only in so far as they illu- 
minate her personality. And here Miss Deakin's 
sympathy is of value. It enables her to escape 
the usual over-emphasis on George Eliot's in- 
tellect, and to hold fairly firmly to what was 
central in her personality. This is especially 
evident in the writer's treatment of that most 
interesting phase of George Eliot's emotional 
development : her relinquishment of Calvinistic 
evangelicalism, and adoption, while at Coventry, 
of a positivistic view of life. 

Miss Deakin's achievement, then, has been 
to make clearer than before the harmony of 
George Eliot's emotional and intellectual life. 
One wishes, however, that she had developed 
this subject more fully and explicitly ; she misses 
a number of excellent opportunities for doing 
so, as if unconscious of her mission. Further- 
more, her book presents several misinterpreta- 
tions; and the style is faulty. These several 
defects, however, seem to the present reviewer 
venial in comparison with the shortcomings 
characteristic of the majority of minor biogra- 
phies which have been appearing during the past 
two decades generally in connection with some 
series or other. The writers of these little books 
apply to their material no other principle of 
selection, seemingly, than that of setting down 
whatever items, of a biographical or critical 



52

nature, happen to pop into their minds. Un- 
less, as infrequently happens, the biographer's 
own personality is of sufficient import to lend 
a continuous interest to his work, such a method 
is sterile, peculiarly so when applied to the 
majority of nineteenth century authors, whose 
lives were on the whole lacking in external inter- 
est, and demand a treatment radically different 
from the impressionistic and anecdotal. Fortu- 
nately this need is beginning to be perceived. 
A trend toward a more centripetal treatment 
has made its appearance. At length, affected, 
perhaps, by the predominant scientific attitude 
of mind, several minor biographers have shown 
signs of willingness to go through the mental 
labor necessary to discover the essential beneath 
the purely external and commonplace. Such 
an aim naturally leads to the placing of greater 
stress on the earlier lives of nineteenth century 
authors. In extreme cases, like those of Words- 
worth and George Eliot, where almost nothing 
of inner significance occurs in the author's later 
years, these may well be almost entirely ignored. 
M. Legouis's "La Jeunesse de Wordsworth," 
1896, represents what may almost be designated 
a new literary genre. Miss Deakin's book is a 
humbler representative of the same general type. 
It evinces, even though imperfectly, the three 
essentials which this variety of work must possess 
if it is to be as attractive, and as successful, as 
the best biographies of the more Boswellian type: 
keen and comprehensive study of all available 
materials; deliberate concision; psychological 
understanding of personality, attended with 
complete sympathy for the author under con- 



sideration.

THE PITH OF THE CLASSICS.* 

Banting in literature is a proposition which 
will soon have to be seriously considered, if the 
human race is not to be crowded off the planet 
by the accumulation of books. There have 
been individual instances of prodigious liter- 
ary production in the past ; but as a rule the 
writers whose work has come down to us, while

they might have had as much to say as our 
moderns, did not take up as much room to say it 
in. Many recent poets for instance have written 
as much as the combined work of Homer, 
Virgil, Lucretius, Pindar, Horace, and Catullus. 
We cannot rely on an Omar coming along to 
burn our libraries ; and as our authors will not 
themselves do anything to reduce their super- 
fluous avoirdupois, the business will have to be 
attended to for them. 

A beginning was made by Matthew Arnold 
when he compressed Wordsworth and Byron 
each into a small volume. He was successful 
with the first, whose work is easily divisible into 
good and bad; but Byron, who is always Byron, 
cannot be really represented by single pieces 
or extracts. Richardson's interminable epic of 
sentiment, " Clarissa Harlowe," has also been 
condensed; but it is more tolerable with all its 
original embonpoint than in the skeletonized 
presentment. 

But the largest effort which has been made 
to put English classics into limitation and con- 
fine is "The Regent Library," some fourteen 
volumes of which have been issued, with more 
in preparation. The plan of this publication 
consists in giving the best short pieces or 
specimen extracts from the respective authors, 
with requisite apparatus of biographical and 
critical introductions, notes, testimonials and 
bibliographical appendices. As far as the three 
poets now included Cowper, Wordsworth, 
and Shelley are concerned, the result is all 
that could be desired. Practically everything 
is given of these writers which anyone save a 
professed student or a special enthusiast really 
needs. More than that, by the separation of 
their grain from their chaff these poets gain in 
value and efficacy. In Cowper's case it may 
be noted that a very few pages suffice to contain 
the poetry which time has winnowed from his 
mass, and that the greater part of the book is 
given up to his letters, "Cowper's divine 
chit-chat." 

In regard to the essayists, also, we think 
the method of this set of reprints fully justifies 
itself. As much of Johnson, the writer, is given 
as most human beings will want to read; the 
far more important Johnson, the talker, being 
always accessible in Boswell. The introduction 
to this volume is in Mr. Chesterton's best style, 
a style which makes so many hits and yet so 
little impression. The volume devoted to Leigh 
Hunt gives the finest wine of that exhilarating 
spirit, though the criticisms from "Imagi- 
nation and Fancy" can hardly be appreciated 



1913]

without the poetry which they accompany and 
interpret. It was a good idea of the editor's to 
include Mary Wollstonecraft in the series. 
The quite full reproduction of the "Rights of 
Woman" of this pioneer of the woman cause 
ought to be of special interest to-day. The 
introduction is an admirable brief biography, 
and its enthusiasm for Mary Wollstonecraft's 
noble character is borne out by her letters. 
Perhaps no English author needs a popularizing 
volume of this kind more than Thomas Love 
Peacock. He can hardly be said to be hidden 
in excess of light; but his fulness of thought, 
and his odd turn of wit, humor, and satire, have 
kept him from having any vogue. 

In regard to the novelists included in the 
Library Richardson, Jane Austen, Mrs. 
Gaskell, Dickens, we are more in doubt as 
to the value of the volumes. The art of novel 
writing is largely the art of dilution, and a 
glass of sea water does not become more con- 
centrated by being separated from its parent 
element. Extracts cannot give the power and 
completeness of great characters, the building 
up of which is the novelists' most triumphant 
work. Even so, however, such specimens are 
better than critical disquisitions or studies 
which fill a reader's mind with second-hand 
impressions of authors of whom perhaps he may 
not have read a page in the original books. Such 
specimens may at least give him a taste, a flavor, 
which is keen in its kind, and which may lead 
him on to a full repast. 

The Library only goes afield for one volume, 
a partial reproduction of Charles Cotton's trans- 
lation of the Commentaries of Blaise de Monluc, 
sometime Marechal of France. This is a fine 
record of fighting and adventure by a precursor 
of D'Artagnan, whose life had more of real war- 
fare in it and less of swaggering than that of 
Dumas's hero. 

It seems to us that it would be an excellent 
thing if the projectors of this series were to 
extend its scope and let us have in translation 
volumes of specimens of many modern conti- 
nental authors. Lessing, Goethe, Heine, Hugo, 
De Musset, Lamartine, Manzoni, Leopardi, 
Carducci, and a score of others could thus be 
brought within the horizon of multitudes of 
English and American readers to whom in their 
own languages or in bulky translations they are 
sealed books. 

But there is still plenty of work to be done at 
home. Two English authors, Burns and Cole- 
ridge, who are not included in the prospectus 
of the Regent Library, would seem especially 



in need of its methods. Out of Burns's three 
hundred pieces, long and short, not more than 
forty-five or fifty are of great value, have the 
stamp of immortality. It would be a service to 
him to separate these from the mass of mediocre 
verse and failures. Coleridge's four or five 
best pieces are the most quintessential poetry in 
the language. There are a few other lyrics, 
three odes, and a number of translated passages 
which might go with these. His great criticism 
is already a chaos of fragments so it would be 
no sacrilege to select the best of it to make up 
a volume. 

The volumes of " The Regent Library " are 
well printed, of convenient and compact form, 
and sold at a very moderate price. Each 
volume contains a photogravure portrait.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Twilight j n the course of the last decade THE 

stretches T\ i r ^i i 

in Greek DIAL has frequently commented upon 

religion. the historical and ethical significance 

of Greek religion, and upon the important develop- 
ments following the application of the methods and 
results of anthropology to the available material in 
that field. The day when the scholar settled the 
problems of Hellenic religious customs and feeling 
by referring only to the great authors of antiquity 
is definitely past ; and the twentieth century student 
is quite as likely to appeal to a Central Australian 
tabu as to a passage from ^Eschylus. This tendency 
is seen very instructively in Professor Gilbert Mur- 
ray's " Four Stages of Greek Religion " (Columbia 
University Press). The brilliant author, as every- 
one knows, is a literatus of the literati, and he him- 
self still distinguishes in his preface between " the 
anthropologist " and " the scholar "; but he has wel- 
comed the new light most heartily, and two of the 
main divisions of the volume depend very largely 
upon conceptions and postulates outside the old lit- 
erary range. Professor Murray takes up first the 
primitive beginnings of religion in Greece, the Age 
of Ignorance ; secondly, the Olympian, or classical 
stage; thirdly, the Hellenistic period, the "Failure 
of Nerve"; and fourthly, the final pagan reaction 
in the time of Julian. In its treatment " the book 
avoids the great illuminated places, and gives its 
mind to the stretches of intervening twilight." It 
is delightfully clear and intelligible, as well as pro- 
vocatively suggestive, and will amply repay thought- 
ful perusal. In the first two sections a reviewer 
could stir a quarrel on almost any page, particu- 
larly where conclusions are cheerfully based upon 
the author's well-known theories about Homeric 
problems. Nothing could be more irritating to a 
disputant who cannot share Professor Murray's 



54 



THE DIAL 



confidence in their validity. However, these and 
all other differences are merely incidents of progress 
in a difficult subject, "which is still changing and 
showing new facets year by year." In the third and 
fourth divisions the conditions of judgment are more 
stable, and the conclusions proportionately less con- 
trovertible. It was a most happy thought to include, 
as an authoritative statement of pagan doctrine in 
the fourth century, a translation of the little-known 
work of Sallustius, " On the Gods and the World." 
The studies are written in the graceful English one 
associates with Professor Murray's name, although 
in a few instances a sensitive ear will feel that 
facility of presentation has lapsed into carelessness. 

The working, " The . Governments of Europe" is 
of European the title of an interesting and in- 
aovernments. forming volume by Prof. Frederic 
Austin Ogg of Simmons College, Boston. " It is the 
object of this book to promote the intelligent study 
of government by supplying working descriptions 
of the governmental systems of the various countries 
of western and central Europe as they have taken 
form and as they operate at the present day." It 
was the author's intention to include all the European 
governments, but lack of space forced him to omit 
those of Russia, Turkey, and the Balkan States. 
Much has been written on Professor Ogg's subject 
in recent years, but his work has certain character- 
istics that entitle it to a place in the literature of 
political science: it is historical as well as descrip- 
tive, and discusses forces as well as forms. Except 
in the case of the English government, the author 
has not found it necessary to sketch an extensive 
historical background, as nearly all the constitutions 
of modern Europe have seen the light since 1815 ; 
still, he is careful in every case to trace the genesis 
of the prevailing system. Some attention is also 
given to governmental forces as organized in political 
parties. Most of the space is given to the central 
institutions, but local government is not neglected, 
though it must be said that this phase of the subject 
shows less skilful treatment. The discussion has 
been brought down to date on every subject : the 
book gives satisfactory accounts of the constitution 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina (1910), of Alsace-Lorraine 
(1911), of the republican constitution of Portugal 
(1911), of the last English Parliament Act (1911), 
and of the newer political issues that have disturbed 
European politics during the last few years. Though 
primarily intended for text-book purposes, Professor 
Ogg's book will also prove serviceable for the 
general reader who wishes clear and concise accounts 
of how government is administered in the European 
states. 

The art ^ tne se " es ^ illustrated handbooks 

treature* of on " The Art Galleries of Europe " 
Hertford Houe. published by L. C. Page & Co. there 
is added a handsome volume entitled " The Art of 
the Wallace Collection," by Mr. Henry C. Shelley. 
It is now thirteen years since Hertford House, where 
the late Sir Richard Wallace gathered his matchless 



examples of French, Dutch, Flemish, and British 
art, was opened to the world as a public museum 
maintained by the English government in accordance 
with the terms of Lady Wallace's will ; but no such 
popularly useful and interesting account of its 
treasures in painting, sculpture, furniture, arms, and 
armor as Mr. Shelley has at last prepared has 
hitherto been available. His book opens with a short 
preface, then sketches the history of the Wallace 
collection, with some account of Lord Hertford, by 
whom was bequeathed to Richard Wallace what was 
to constitute the best part of the now famous art 
treasures bearing the legatee's name, and then pro- 
ceeds to describe the more remarkable features of 
the collection as they are to be seen in the various 
galleries of the museum. Illustrations from photo- 
graphs, forty-eight in number, help to call attention 
to what is most noteworthy; and the book is well 
indexed at the end. A former keeper of the collec- 
tion, Sir Claude Phillips, has very recently called 
attention, in the London "Telegraph," to its peculiar 
importance and value. He says : " If the French 
art of the eighteenth century is now much better 
known in England than it was a few years ago, the 
reason is that the Wallace collection has permanently 
brought under the eyes of connoisseurs and the public 
much that is finest in the painting and sculpture, as 
well as the applied art, of that period." He also 
declares that Watteau's art is here " illustrated on a 
larger scale and in greater variety and brilliancy 
than in any gallery, public or private, save only 
those of the Louvre and of the palaces of Berlin 
and Pottsdam." Hence it is that one might reason- 
ably have expected in Mr. Shelley's book a more 
marked emphasis on the Watteau feature of the 
collection, and more than his one illustration from 
that artist. But the volume is carefully prepared, 
shows the courage of the writer's preferences, and 
is interesting. 

It is a hard saying, but much of the 

The story of a trouble in the civilized world to-day

rests upon ignorance of the condi- 
tions prevailing outside of the economic class to 
which each of us is assigned. The poor are ignor- 
ant of the grace and ease of living among the 
wealthy and refined, or by their very numbers they 
would make extravagances and excesses impossible ; 
the rich and cultivated are no less ignorant of the 
degradation involved in utter poverty, or merely for 
humanity's sake they would take steps to alleviate 
it. Few in the community know the whole truth 
about both the classes which may be roughly grouped 
as " poor " or " rich," and it is significant that those 
who do are largely devoting their lives to an ameli- 
oration of existing conditions. No better basis for 
imagining what it is that the very poor have to con- 
tend with, hour by hour, can be found than " The 
Autobiography of a Working Woman " (F. G. 
Browne & Co.), to the American edition of which 
an introduction has been provided by Mr. Jenkin 
Lloyd Jones, in addition to the introductions already

THE DIAL

written for the English edition by August Bebel and 
J. Ramsay Macdonald, M.P. It is the story of the 
life of Mrs. Adelheid Popp, a leader among German 
socialists, covering her entire memory of life until 
she found herself through sheer force of character 
in her present commanding position. Throughout 
her girlhood she was very poor. Her father drank 
himself into an early grave, leaving his family desti- 
tute of everything except the tender compassion of 
those no better off than themselves that wonderful 
charity of the poor toward one another, by which 
the rich, if they could realize it, would be shamed. 
Little by little, chiefly through an engrossing love 
for reading, the girl lifted herself intellectually out 
of the ignorance and superstition to which she was 
born. Socialism, chiefly in the form of benefiting 
mankind, took the place of her old religion, and by 
its ideals she shaped a new life. She married within 
the socialistic ranks and found there all her happi- 
ness, using the inspiration it gave her to elevate those 
still in the stratum from which she had extricated 
herself. The book shows no dogmatism and presents 
no minute facts which might tire a casual reader, 
but it is instinct with truth, and it presents that bitter 
sordidness which has been the destruction of count- 
less souls less strong than that unconsciously depicted 
by its author. 

Sight-seeing Mr ; George Palmer Putnam, of j our- 
in Central nalistic experience and talents, as his 

America. chapters reveal, presents a brisk and 

entertaining as well as instructive account of things 
seen in Central America in his book, "The South- 
land of North America" (Putnam). From Panama 
to Guatemala he and his wife proceeded by leisurely 
stages or steamers, rather stopping at the chief 
seaports, and now and then pushing inland from 
the Pacific coast to an interior capital or other point 
of interest. Twice (at Limon and Puerto Barrios) 
the Atlantic shore line was reached, and once, in 
Guatemala, a point was attained by the writer where 
the two oceans were visible. This commanding 
height was the summit of Mt. Acatenango. By 
familiar intercourse with official and other persons 
in the countries visited, Mr. Putnam equipped him- 
self with facts and figures and other information 
for the ultimate enrichment of his volume. He also 
brought home a large number of photographs taken 
by himself and turned to excellent account in the 
illustration of the book. A good map is provided, as 
also an appendix packed with statistical and other 
useful matter in condensed form. From his chapter 
on Costa Rica's capital, we quote in closing this bit 
of information concerning an institution one might 
not have expected to find in that little tropical city : 
"The Biblioteca Nacional, or public library, with 
about 50,000 volumes well housed, represents the 
literary side of life better than might be expected 
in an isolated land of 350,000 inhabitants. To be 
sure, the dust that covers many shelves perhaps 
indicates a livelier interest in music and the drama 
than in literature. Mark Twain was well repre- 



sented, and Sefior Ferroz, the aged librarian, told 
us that Dickens, whose works we found in Spanish 
and French as well as English, was by all odds the 
'best seller' to-day." Especially commendable is 
Mr. Putnam's care to confine his remarks to that 
of which he has personal or otherwise trustworthy 
knowledge, a practice not universal with writers on 

Latin America. 

The making Professor Max Farrand's volume of 
of our some two hundred and fifty pages, 

Constitution. -phe Framing of the Constitution" 
(Yale University Press), is based upon the same 
author's elaborate work, "The Records of the Federal 
Convention," already reviewed at length in the 
columns of THE DIAL. The "Records," largely 
concerned with matters of textual criticism, made 
its appeal to the technical student; "The Framing 
of the Constitution" is a summary of the impressions 
of the Federal Convention derived by the author 
from his ten years' labor in this special field of 
American history, and is intended for popular 
consumption. It is an example of what such a work 
ought to be ; for while the narrative is made simple, 
and references are omitted, the book is the result 
of a scholarly investigation, and in every page 
meets the tests of criticism. In this respect it con- 
trasts interestingly with the corresponding chapters 
in Fiske's " Critical Period," which present, for the 
most part, an interesting decoction of Bancroft. 
Professor Farrand treats of the defects of the 
Confederation, the calling of the Convention, its 
personnel and organization, the plans that were 
submitted to its consideration, the compromises that 
were made, and the adoption of the Constitution. 
A final chapter reviews in its entirety the work 
accomplished at Philadelphia, reaching the conclusion 
that the Constitution is " neither a work of divine 
origin, nor ' the greatest work that was ever struck 
off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man,' 
but a practical workable document." "Planned to 
meet certain immediate needs and modified to suit 
the exigencies of the situation, it was floated on a 
wave of commercial prosperity, and it has been 
adapted by an ingenious political people to meet the 
changing requirements of a century and a quarter."

his career as a member of Parliament, was one of

inator of certain very useful literary ventures, such 
as the Parliamentary History, the State Trials, and 
the Political Register. But in his own day he was 
prominent as an opposition journalist, as a political 
pamphleteer of the radical type. Cobbett has re- 
cently found an enthusiastic biographer in Mr. Lewis 
Melville, who has published his studies in the life 
and times of the great radical leader in two volumes 
under the title "The Life and Letters of William

Cobbett in England and America" (Lane). There 
have been earlier sketches of Cobbett 's life, but no 
one has hitherto attempted so complete a study as 
the one undertaken by Mr. Melville. The author 
has had access to a great deal of unpublished 
material, chiefly letters, many of which have been 
embodied in the work. The volumes are not a biog- 
raphy as the term is usually understood : they are a 
collection of letters, with occasional pages of narra- 
tive where the documents fail to tell a clear or con- 
nected story. Mr. Melville is an admirer of William 
Cobbett, but his admiration has not left him blind to 
the defects of Cobbett's character : proper emphasis 
is placed on his abilities and achievements, but no 
attempt is made to conceal his inordinate egotism or 
to justify his crude and violent methods. The au- 
thor has successfully avoided the appearance of par- 
tisanship and the temptation to act as an advocate. 
His work, however, will be of only slight interest to 
the general reader; but the serious student of En- 
glish history will find it of great value for the light 
that the documents throw on the early history of 
British radicalism. 

Earnest essavs No other of . our latter-day essayists 
on serious approaches in combined incisiveness 
themes. an( j ponderosity Mr. Francis Grier- 
son, whose latest volume, "The Invincible Alliance 
and Other Essays" (Lane), has just appeared. His 
style is at once a keen rapier and a crushing sabre, 
and he brandishes his dangerous weapon with mag- 
nificent assurance. " It requires Anglo-maniacal ef- 
frontery to broach the subject of disarmament when 
dealing with a people like the Germans. Whence 
comes this effrontery ? " The old dispensation, hav- 
ing survived six hundred years, he says elsewhere, 
is at an end, and we are at the threshold of a new 
civilization: "Conditions will change to such a de- 
gree that in nothing will the coming dispensation 
resemble anything in the old." Again, "To-day 
nothing but a hatch separates us from primitive 
barbarism." In subject, the essays range from 
"Republic or Empire?" and "Savonarola" to 
"The Psychology of Dress" and "The Soul's New 
Refuge." All are serious in treatment, for the 
author is terribly in earnest even when his tone is 
bantering. Indeed, his pronunciamentos, though 
they indicate wide knowledge and observation and 
an active mind, too often suggest grimness and in- 
flexibility. Yet these very qualities have their value : 
Mr. Grierson awakens the mind, starts long and often 
new trains of thought, through his unique rapier 
and sabre attack.

representative at Washington for the last six years 
give especial interest and weight to the volume of 
public utterances "University and Historical Ad- 
dresses" (Macmillan) which he has published as 
embodying the treatment of topics having an im- 



portance that is more than ephemeral. Twenty-two 
out of a far larger number of discourses delivered 
in America between 1907 and 1912 are thus repro- 
duced, with some changes, additions, and omissions, 
from the speaker's notes. Naturally they are in 
most instances what we call "occasional" addresses, 
addresses commemorative of some historic anni- 
versary or in celebration of some literary or educa- 
tional festivity. Thus we find, among the more 
important subjects treated, "The Beginnings of 
Virginia," "The Landing of the Pilgrims in 1620," 
"Thomas Jefferson: Third President of the United 
States and Founder of the University of Virginia," 
"The Character and Career of Abraham Lincoln," 
"The Study of Ancient Literature," "Some Hints 
on Reading," and "The Constitution of the United 
States." What the reader of literary tendencies 
will most like in the book is the repeated insistence 
on the importance of the "humanities " in all courses 
of higher education, and the warning against too 
early or too great specialization. Like apples of 
gold in pictures of silver is this fitly-spoken word. 
An incidental compliment of a high order to our 
public library system will be found near the begin- 
ning of the author's remarks on reading. The ad- 
dresses are all excellent as literature which cannot 
be said of most public speeches, and they preserve 
much of the charm of Mr. Bryce's personality. 

Among the most temperate of re- 
cent estimates of Goethe is the little 
volume entitled " Goethe and the 
Twentieth Century" (Holt), by Prof. J. G. Robertson, 
of the University of London. A long residence in 
Germany has given Professor Robertson a genuine 
German appreciation of his author, yet he cannot 
wholly overcome his native Scotch standards of 
reason and conduct. The little book tempts to 
much quotation, but it will be fairer to let English 
readers resort for themselves to so condensed and 
on the whole so fair a presentation of Germany's 
greatest exemplar. Professor Robertson's argument 
is, that Goethe is peculiarly individualistic and there- 
fore continues to appeal to modern men. "What- 
ever we may say of the futility, or even shallowness, 
of Goethe's metaphysics ; however vague and elusive 
his religious thought may be; however transient 
and unjustified by later developments his social 
and political theories, we have still to say that no 
thinker of modern times has spoken so wisely and 
with such finality on the conduct of personal life 
as Goethe." To all of which one might easily 
dissent, to the detraction as well as to the commen- 
dation. But nevertheless, this is a book well worth 
reading. Alexander Baumgartner's "Goethe: Sein 
Leben und seine Werke" (St. Louis: Herdersche 
Verlagshandlung) is a work that commands respect 
for the thoroughness of its research and the frank- 
ness of its attack. As an antidote to the deification 
of Goethe, so common among German critics and 
historians, it has its proper place. It must be said 



1913] 



THE DIAL

that Baumgartner is not wholly without admiration 
for the great German pagan, and treats him rather 
better than Menzel. Perhaps no other biography 
of Goethe is so coherent, diary-like, and useful for 

reference. 

The study I n " The Cotton Manufacturing In- 

Ame g rican dustry in the United States " (Har- 

industrv. vard University Press), Dr. Melvin 

T. Copeland, brings together the results of several 
years of investigation concerning the growth and 
present condition of a staple American industry. The 
first part of the study is devoted to the history and 
present organization of the industry, while in the 
second part the relative position of the United 
States with reference to other countries is taken up. 
The growth of the industry is traced from the 
establishment of the first successful cotton mill in 
this country, in 1790, down to the present day, as 
evidenced by spinning and weaving, the making of 
lace and smallwares and knit goods. Then follow 
chapters on geographical distribution, technical de- 
velopment, labor, textile schools, scale of production 
and specialization, associations and combinations, 
the raw cotton market, the cloth market, export 
trade, import trade, and dividends and prices. The 
relative position of the United States is brought out 
by a first-hand study, and by comparison of the 
industry here with that in England, France, 
Switzerland, and Germany. As to export trade the 
conclusion is that the competition which American 
exporters will find most severe is that of the English. 
The study is both scholarly and interesting, and 
will prove of great value to the student of economic 
development. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Of especial appeal to American readers among the 
latest volumes in " Everyman's Library " (Button) are 
Crevecoeur's "Letters from an American Farmer," 
with an interesting introduction by Mr. Warren Barton 
Blake; and Robert Buchanan's "Life and Adventures 
of Audubon," with a reprint of Mr. John Burroughs's 
essay on Audubon by way of preface. We trust that 
these two fascinating records of outdoor life in the early 
days of America may find many thousands of new read- 
ers in this convenient and inexpensive form. 

Few American publishing enterprises are deserving 
of such unqualified approval as the " Macmillan Stand- 
ard Library," which is making accessible in substantial 
and inexpensive form some of the best serious books of 
recent years. Two late additions to the series, typical 
of its general quality, are Mr. H. G. Wells's "New 
Worlds for Old," probably the most lucid and convinc- 
ing outline of Socialism now available; and Professor 
Mahaffy's well-loved " Rambles and Studies in Greece," 
which although issued nearly forty years ago still holds 
its own. This new edition (the seventh^ seems to have 
been carefully revised, and contains a new preface by 
the author. 

A pretty little volume of " Ancient Gems in Modern 
Settings," being versions from the Greek Anthology in 
English rhymes by various authors, has been compiled 



by Dr. G. B. Grundy, and issued by the Oxford publisher., 
Mr. B. H. Blackwell. The compiler has frankly followed 
his own taste in the matter of the versions selected, 
and a liberal sprinkling of his own skilful renderings is 
included. The result as a whole is perhaps the most 
satisfactory presentation of the Anthology now avail- 
able in English. It seems to us that the translators' 
names should have been appended to their work ; one 
does not like to have to refer constantly to a table of 
contents for information of this sort. But we can find 
no other ground for criticism of what is altogether a 
charming little book. 

The noteworthy " Loeb Classical Library " (Mac- 
millan), which was described and discussed in detail in 
our issue of February 16 last, is making satisfactory 
progress. Of the later volumes that have reached us, 
only one belongs to the Latin section, the first of three 
volumes embodying Cicero's Letters, in the rendering 
of Mr. E. O. Winstedt. The Greek books comprise a 
two-volume Sophocles, translated by Mr. F. Storr; 
" The Greek Bucolic Poets," translated by Mr. J. M. 
Edmonds; Appian's Roman History, translated by Dr. 
Horace White, in four volumes; "The Fall of Troy" by 
Quintus of Smyrna, translated by Dr. Arthur S. Way; 
the second and concluding volume of " The Apostolic 
Fathers," translated by Mr. Kirsopp Lake; the "Argo- 
nautica " of Apollonius Rhodius, translated by Mr. R. 
C. Seaton; and the first of three volumes comprising 
the Works of the Emperor Julian, translated by Dr. 
Wilmer Cave Wright. 

What libraries to visit in Great Britain, when the 
American librarian takes his vacation abroad, is a ques- 
tion not unlikely to arise; and the answer will be found, 
succinctly given, in " A British Library Itinerary " 
(London: Grafton & Co.), by Mr. James Duff Brown, 
Borough Librarian of the Islington Free Libraries, pro- 
lific writer on library science, and initiator of a number 
of reforms in library administration. More than five- 
score libraries in England, Scotland, and Wales, chosen 
in such manner as to present all varieties of type with- 
out needless repetition, are arranged in groups, under 
such headings as " Liverpool Centre," " Manchester 
Centre," " Edinburgh Centre," " London Centre," etc., 
with brief descriptions calling especial attention to char- 
acteristic features. The little guide is put forth in 
response to a demand for some such selective list from 
American and Colonial librarians, and seems excellently 
suited to its purpose. 

Wilhelm Lamszus's booklet, " The Human Slaughter- 
House" (Stokes), made its author known in Germany 
partly because of its character, partly also because the 
government authorities of his district tried to oust him 
from his teaching position for writing it. That he 
possesses literary power of the hysterical sort is suffi- 
ciently shown by these pages. The thing reminds one 
of " The Red Laugh " of Andreiff . The scenes it pictures 
from " the war that is sure to come," though possible, 
are none the less imaginary and are not likely to inspire 
the average man with an aversion to war. Lamszus's 
thesis, which is further developed in the excellent 
preface by Mr. Oakley Williams, is that war is now no 
more a conflict between persons, and can no longer 
claim the benefits which are alleged to proceed from 
such conflicts ; it is to-day a conflict waged by machinery. 
The machine gun delivers wounded and dead men as 
another machine turns out buttons in a factory. All 
that is needed, thinks Lamszns, is some mechanical

device to bury the victims. It seems analogous to an 
Armour or Swift plant, hence the title, " The Human 
Slaugh ter-House. " 

The first volume of the Truxton Beale Prize Essays, 
published by the University of California, deals with 
Tolstoy's What Shall We Do Then ? " It is not only 
notable as a most interesting departure in university 
publications and university incentives to thought, but 
the subject of the essays and the manner of treatment 
speak well for the social idealism which is permeating 
American university circles. The first essay in this col- 
lection of five is by Mr. Bayard Hale Jones, and exhibits 
the social teachings of Tolstoy in relation to his personal 
experiences and the almost mediaeval state of the coun- 
try whose problems gave birth to Tolstoy's social ideal- 
ism. The second essay, by Mr. Sheldon Warren Cheney, 
contains an interpretation and a critical application of 
Tolstoy's ideas to the present-day social situation. The 
testimony of these and the other essayists whose work 
is included in the volume is a remarkable one to the 
suggestive as well as the inspirational value of Tolstoy's 
thought.

tains the substance of the eight lectures recently deliv- 
ered by him at the University. 

Mr. Bernard Miall has prepared a translation of 
President Poincare"s "How France Is Governed," a 
volume giving an exposition of the national system of 
France. The volume is announced for immediate pub- 
lication by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin. 

Mr. Norman Duncan has returned from a long trip 
to Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, where, 
together with the artist Mr. George Harding, he has 
been collecting material for a series of travel articles 
which will appear in " Harper's Magazine." 

The articles of Mr. Robert Hichens on the Balkan 
Peninsula and its scenic wonders which have been ap- 
pearing in the " Century " will be published in book 
form in the late fall by the Century Co. The illustrations 
in color are from the canvases of M. Gue'rin. 

Among other Oxford Press books now in active pre- 
paration are the following: " The Rise and Fall of the 
High Commission," by Roland G. Usher; " The King's 
Council during the Middle Ages," by James F. Baldwin; 
"Stoics and Sceptics," by Edwyn Bevan; "The Living 



Past: A Sketch of Western Progress," by F. S. Marvin; 
" The Genesis of Lancaster," by Sir James Ramsay; and

Among forthcoming books to be published by Messrs.

by Mr. Edward F. Adams, a third edition of " Comfort 
Found in Good Old Books," by Mr. George Hamlin, 
and the same author's new volume, " A Critic in the 
Orient." 

With California so prominently in the public eye as 
it is at present, a timely interest attaches to " The Story 
of California," by Mr. Henry K. Norton, which Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. announce for early publication. 
In this volume the history of the state is covered from 
1542 to the present time. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. announce for early 
issue " Public Opinion and Popular Government," by 
President Lowell of Harvard; "Organized Democracy," 
by Mr. Frederick A. Cleveland; "Modern American 
Speeches," edited by Professor Lester W. Boardman; 
and " A History of England," by Professor Edward P.

Five books are on the list of publications of Messrs. 
D. Appleton & Co. for the month. They include " The 
Psychology of Laughter," by Boris Sidis; the seventh 
volume of Professor John Bach McMaster's " History 
of the People of the United States"; "A Handbook of 
Wireless Telegraphy," by Mr. James Erskine-Murray; 
"De Garino's Wife," by David Graham Phillips; and 
" The Whistling Man," by Mr. Maximilian Foster. 

To meet the demand in Germany for Mr. George J. 
Kneeland's " Commercialized Prostitution in New York 
City," arrangements have been made for a German 
translation of the book, and of the three forthcoming 
publications to be issued by the Century Co. for the 
Bureau of Social Hygiene. The translator is Frau 
Adele Schreiber, of Berlin, a prominent worker in the 
suffrage movement in Germany, and author of two 
important works on " The Child " and " The Mother." 

Coincident with the publication by Mr. B. W. Huebsch 
of the second volume of Hauptmann's Dramas in En- 
glish, comes the news that " political and intellectual 
Germany has not for years been so torn asunder as at 
the present moment over the action of the city of 
Breslau in banning Gerhart Hauptmann's epic cen- 
tenary drama on the ground of its alleged unpatriotic 
tendencies," to quote a special despatch to the New 
York " Times." The despatch goes on to state that the 
play was taken off at the instance of the Crown Prince, 
and that the country " is fairly divided into Hauptmann 
and anti-Hauptmanu camps." Their charges and 
counter-charges fill the press, dominate private conver- 
sation, and are so all-pervasive that they have already 
obliterated the jubilee memories. 

Among the fall publications of the Yale University 
Press already approved by the University Council's 
Committee on publications are the following: " Life and 
Letters of Nathan Smith," edited by Emily A. Smith; 
" The Evolution of Modern Medicine," by Sir William 
Osier; "Earth Hunger and Other Essays," by William 
Graham Sumner; "From the Letter Files of William

HISTORY OF ENGLAND 

By ALLEN C. THOMAS 

Professor of History in Haverford College 
CXCELLENT qualities of this work are charm of style, grasp 
J-* of salient facts and principles, and dramatic portrayal of 
the greater personages and periods. The rise of the common 
people from villeinage to a share and later control in repre- 
sentative government is traced with clearness and force. The 
growth of Parliament, the decreasing power of the nobles, 
the influence of great men, the vast social and economic 
changes, the development of the British Empire, and the 
problems of the present are adequately set forth.

LORD MACAULAY 

England's Greatest Historian, said in the Edinburgh Review 

"When I devour the pregnant pages of Ainsworth I am lost in amazement that his wonderful 
historical novels have not an abiding place in every house. A dabbler in history myself, I can fully 
appreciate the charm which his romantic style imparts to an often dry subject. His close adherence 
to established facts woven together in such attractive form renders his series of romances indis- 
pensable in the family circle. He always charms, but never misleads." 



Ainsworth has done for English history what Dumas pere did for the French : both wrote 
romances, interwoven with history, in such a way that they occupy the foremost place as historical 
romances in the literary annals of these countries. Ainsworth spun his web of fiction about the 
courts of Windsor, St. James, the Louvre, and the Escorial, and he is never so happy as when 
picturing Charles II and his madcap court at Whitehall, his witty sayings and his galaxy of beauties, 
the piquant Louise de Queroualle, the dazzling duchesses, poor bewitching Nelly, and, large as life, 
Sir Peter Lely a-painting of them. The gay court at Paris is shown at its most interesting period; 
Crichton, the Admirable, was a brilliant Scotsman, whose handsome person, accomplishments, and 
courage, earned for him that title. The scene is laid during the time of Catherine de' Medici, and 
is full of the intrigues of Henry III, the incognito adventures of ban Henri of Navarre. 

Probably no more graphic accounts have ever been written of the Plague of London and of the 
Great Fire than those in "Old Saint Paul's," and few historical works contain the equal of the 
descriptive writing in "Cardinal Pole," "The Constable of the Tower," or "The Star Chamber." 
In "John Law" is given an extraordinary interesting account of the Mississippi Bubble and of the 
varied career of the great promoter. 

To Ainsworth's skill and energy we are indebted for brilliant pictures of the Tower of London, 
Theobald's, Tower Hill, Newgate, Ranleigh Gardens, etc., which he peopled with realistic portraits 
of the most interesting characters in English history of Henry VIII, his wives, daughters, cardinals, 
and headsmen; of Queen Anne, of the Duchess Sarah, and her Duke of Marlborough; of the 
Lord Mayor of London and his 'prentice-town; etc., 

Ainsworth, born in 1805, carried on the work in historical romance ended by the death of 
Scott. With Ainsworth's death, in 1882, there was sundered the last of the chain of a brilliant 
coterie of English novelists of the nineteenth century: Thackeray, Dickens, Ainsworth. 

As an example of the fascinating and intensely interesting quality of these writings, there will 
be sent, upon receipt of request, absolutely without charge, a booklet apropos of Henry VIII, 
entitled A King and His Wives.

1913] THE DIAL 67 

NEALE'S FOR AUGUST 

Besides the regular departments, The Fraternity of the Fields, which is intended to be 
the eyes and ears of him who may not be with Nature in her many moods, conducted by an 
eminent writer ; The Stage, a department of brilliant, trenchant, fearless criticism of plays, 
actors, and dramatists, conducted by a distinguished critic ; Letters to the Editors, in which 
correspondents discuss among themselves topics of interest ; In Motley, a department of wit and 
humor, not mere jokes, but pointedness, directed chiefly at persons in the limelight ; Editorial 
Comments, in which all sorts of subjects are treated, now seriously, now lightly, yet always 
vigorously, fearlessly, and independently, besides these regular departments and the serials now 
running, the August number, among many interesting features, contains noteworthy contributions 
to general literature, as follows : 

Into the Sunset By Edward S. Van Zile 

The first instalment of this novel, which will run serially in NEALE'S MONTHLY for several 
months, will be published in the August number. The story which is full of the stir of life, the 
clash of swords, the roll of the sea, and "whisperings of love" tells of the romantic career of the 
first Irishman to reach the New World. He came with Columbus, and so did another young man, 
and so did two girls. Mr. Van Zile is the author of several successful novels, the most widely 
read of which, perhaps, is "With Sword and Crucifix," which won for him a doctor's degree in 
literature from Trinity College. 

Souther nism and "The Southerner" By Thomas Pearce Bailey 

Everybody who read "Ambassador Page No Southerner," by Elizabeth H. Hancock and Lily 
Young Cohen, which was published in NEALE'S MONTHLY for July, will read this virile paper 
with deep interest. For many years Professor Bailey, a Southern educator and writer, has studied 
Southern social conditions. None interested in those conditions should fail to read this article. 

England's Literary Hierarchy By Lily Young Cohen 

"To a younger nation," says Miss Cohen, "the contemporary writers of an older people 
seem like the writers of yesterday. For example, England's critical attitude toward the literature 
of France is precisely like that of America toward English letters the point of view of a future 
generation looking back upon its ancestors." With these eyes of posterity comparative studies of 
Shaw, Hewlett, Wells, Locke, Barrie, Moore, Masefield, Noyes, and Kipling are made in this 
paper, and the foremost English writer of our time named. 

The Awakening of Iseult By Edith Tatum 

A picturesque and beautiful tale of the idyllic time of King Arthur and his Knights of the 
Round Table. 

The Yellow Peril By J. J. Bowen 

The readers of Bowen 's " Strategy of Robert E. Lee," the serial publication of which in 
NEALE'S MONTHLY has recently been concluded, will welcome this prophetic article, written just 
before its author's death, about a year ago. 

Woman and the Drama By Arthur Pollock 

In this paper Mr. Pollock writes most entertainingly. He tells us, among other things, that 
feminism in relation to the drama began ages ago. There never was a time, he says, when plays 
were not written for woman about woman. 

Campaigning with " Uncle Billy " By Lyman S. Widney 

"Uncle Billy" was the sobriquet affectionately bestowed on General Sherman by his men. 
Mr. Widney's account of the operations of Sherman and the picture he draws of his commander's 
personality make valuable contributions to history. 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every number contains 
more than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain less than 128 pages. In its 
mechanical appointments no magazine in existence is its superior.

ROBERT BRIDGES, POET LAUREATE. 

Two months ago, speaking of the English 
poets upon whose brows the laurel might con- 
ceivably be set, we referred to Dr. Robert 
Bridges as one living apart " in a world of his 
own creation," and therefore probably to be 
passed by in favor of someone more likely to 
be adjudged fit for the laureateship in its patri- 
otic or ceremonial aspect. So high a concep- 
tion of the office as would be embodied in the 
appointment of Dr. Bridges we had not thought 
likely to be entertained by the existing English 
government, intensely preoccupied as it is with 
the very practical work of destroying the foun- 
dations of the English constitution, and setting 
the ship of state adrift upon uncharted perilous 
seas,. We had not taken sufficient account of 
the fact that Mr. Asquith is a gentleman of 
culture and refined judgment, besides being a 
statesman committed by circumstance to a 
detestable political policy, and so we were sur- 
prised as well as delighted when it became 
known that he had made so admirable a choice. 
For it is the simple truth that no English poet 
now living carries on the great tradition of En- 
glish song, as previously upheld by Wordsworth 
and Tennyson, with a finer sense of the poet's 
mission in a blatant age than does this modest 
man of science and accomplished classical 
scholar. 

We call him "Dr. Bridges" because it is 
only courteous to give a man the title to which 
professional distinction entitles him. For this 
there is honorable literary precedent in the cases 
of Dr. Thomas Browne and Dr. Samuel John- 
son, of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes and Dr. 
Weir Mitchell. We notice, however, that cer- 
tain recent comment has used the title of Dr. 
Bridges for purposes of malicious emphasis, and 
as indicative of a sort of veiled resentment of 
the choice of a poet so little known to the average 
reader, and so serenely unconcerned with the 
issues upon which a poet, to secure popularity, 
must now make his appeal to the general public. 
For the new laureate is neither spectacular nor 
freakish ; he does not beat the big drum of the 
jingo, nor does he seek to make capital out of 
whatever form of sentimentalism happens to be 



70 



THE DIAL 



[August 1 



current. He is not a poet of imperialism or of 
democracy; he is neither a society poet nor a 
slum poet ; he is simply an artist whose guiding 
spirit is sestheticism and whose work is con- 
ceived sub specie teternitatis. He writes of the 
enduring themes in the enduring manner, which 
of course invites the attack of horny-eyed phil- 
istines everywhere, and earns him the titles of 
old fogy and conservative and exploiter of old- 
world themes in outworn forms of expression. 
The philistine view of his appointment is voiced 
in such a paragraph as this, taken from a recent 
Chicago newspaper : " Had Mr. Bridges been 
able to cast in his lot with the daring young 
poets who assail society in behalf of the under 
men, who argue for new forms of pageantry in 
which the beaten down men shall carry their 
banners in the procession, the honor now sug- 
gested for him must necessarily have passed him 
by." We are invited nowadays to accept as 
poetry so much crude didacticism and unlicensed 
experimentation that we are in danger of for- 
getting what poetry is and under what severe 
restraints the true poet is bound to labor at his 
creative task. 

The old idea of the laureateship has been so 
completely set aside during the incumbency of 
Wordsworth and Tennyson that we find it diffi- 
cult to realize that these " Bon Gaultier " verses 
of seventy years ago truthfully expressed it. 

" Who would not be 
The laureate bold, 
With his butt of sherry 
To keep him merry, 
And nothing to do but pocket his gold." 

" Oh, that would be the post for me, 
With plenty to get, and nothing to do, 
But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue, 
And whistle a tune to the Queen's cockatoo, 
And scribble of verses remarkably few." 

The better modern idea of the office was that 
of Queen Victoria, who regarded it "as the 
official recognition of a distinguished poet, suffi- 
ciently susceptible to the form and pressure of 
the time to be proclaimed without absurdity as 
its poetical interpreter." We quote from "The 
Saturday Review," which goes on to say: "It is 
not now a Laureate's business to celebrate his 
time. All we require for the office is a poet 
conspicuously distinguished among his fellows 
upon whom an official decoration will not inde- 
corously sit." Dr. Bridges answers almost 
perfectly to this requirement. In his selection 
the choice lay between the abiding elements of 
beauty in the poetic art and those ephemeral 



characteristics which the fashion of the day or 
the caprices of popular taste may emphasize, 
and the choice has fallen upon a poet of the 
right type, even if not upon a poet of the rank 
of. his immediate predecessors. 

One of the loveliest poems that Dr. Bridges 
has written is "Nightingales." 

" Beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come, 
And bright in the fruitful valleys the streams, where- 
from 

Ye learn your song: 
Where are those starry woods? O might I wander 

there, 

Among the flowers, which in that heavenly air 
Bloom the year long! 

" Nay, barren are those mountains and spent the streams : 
Our song is the voice of desire, that haunts our dreams, 

A throe of the heart 

Whose pining visions dim, forbidden hopes profound, 
No dying cadence nor long sigh can sound, 
For all our art. 

" Alone, aloud in the raptured ear of men 
We pour our dark nocturnal secret; and then, 

As night is withdrawn 
From these sweet-springing meads and bursting boughs 

of May, 

Dream, while the innumerable choir of day 
Welcome the dawn." 

The subtle cadences and the haunting music of 
this lyric are the predominant qualities in this 
poet's artistry. They express at once his high 
creative gift, his exact knowledge of metrics, 
and his nice philological scholarship. Of his 
equipment on the side of science, his prose writ- 
ings give ample evidence, the introduction to 
his edition of Keats, for example, or his paper 
"On the Present State of English Pronuncia- 
tion." 

It is on the strength of the last-named paper 
that the shifty spelling reformers have claimed 
Dr. Bridges for their own. It is true that he 
here advocates a phonetic alphabet, but it is 
true also that he says that " phonetic spelling 
is full of horrors," and he would certainly re- 
gard such abortions as "thru " and "program " 
as typically horrible. For his purpose is to 
save English speech from the degradation of 
pronunciation which it is generally suffering in 
the centres of population, and which such dread- 
ful perversities as the two just cited abet and 
encourage. His guiding principle is that we 
should fix our spelling " as we judge words 
should be pronounced, and not as we foresee 
or guess they are coming to be pronounced in 
the normal process of unimpeded degradation." 
If the spelling deformers would but try to save 
or restore the phonetic values that we have lost 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



71 



or are in danger of losing, there would be much 
to be said for them. But their attitude is to 
accept degradation as a fait accompli, and so 
they ask us to write " fixt " for "fixed," although 
the sound of the " d " has by no means vanished 
from the speech of careful persons. The ten- 
dency which is causing unaccented vowels to lose 
their distinctive character, so that "to" and 
" for" and "the " and "sublime " and "above" 
become "ter" and "fer" and "ther " and 
" serblime " and "erbove " is the danger with 
which Dr. Bridges is chiefly concerned, and in 
this connection he relates an amusing anecdote 
of a hospital patient whose bed-card indicated 
that his medicine was to be taken three times a 
day, and who, reading the awful words ter die, 
" whipped out of bed, and fled for his life, to 
add, no doubt, a new tale to the terrers of the 
hospital." If the simplified spellers can extract 
comfort from such advocacy as this, they are 
welcome to it. 

Those whom jealousy on behalf of the muse 
may make apprehensive lest the new laureate 
give to medicine what should belong to poetry 
may be reminded that Dr. Bridges retired from 
the practice of his profession more than thirty 
years ago, and has been exclusively a man of 
letters ever since. He has not sought for pop- 
ularity, and many of his poems, privately 
printed, have not come within the reach of the 
larger public. The Oxford University Press 
has, however, recently published a selected vol- 
ume of his lyrics. His longer poems include 
"The Growth of Love," " Prometheus the Fire- 
giver," " Eros and Psyche," and eight classical 
plays. One of the most sympathetic criticisms 
of his work is that found in the " Studies in 
Seven Arts" of Mr. Arthur Symons. The fol- 
lowing paragraph is this critic's summing up of 
the essential qualities of the poet : 

" Here is an artist so scrupulous that beauty itself 
must come only in sober apparel, joy only walking tem- 
perately, sorrow without the private disfiguring of 
tears. Made, as it is, out of what might be the com- 
monplace, if it were not the most select thing in the 
world; written, as it is, with a deliberateness which 
might be cold, if it were not at that quiet heat in which 
rapture is no longer astonished at itself; realizing, as it 
does, Coleridge's requirement that poetry in its higher 
and purer sense should demand continuous admiration, 
not regular recurrence of conscious surprise; this poe- 
try, more than almost any in English, is art for art's 
sake ; and it shows, better certainly than any other, how 
that formula .saves from excess, rather than induces to 
it. So evenly are form and substance set over against 
each other that it might be said, with as much or as 
little justice, that everything exists, for form, or that 
nothing is sacrificed to it." 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

THE FICTION MONTH in the magazine world is 
August, a vacation month very well adapted to the 
sort of recreation found in reading stories, especially 
short stories. It was twenty-four years ago that the 
first fiction number made its appearance in that 
memorable issue of " Scribner's Magazine " (as its 
publishers now take pleasure in reminding us) which 
contained Mr. Harrison Robertson's "How the 
Derby Was Won," Mr. T. R. Sullivan's "The Rock 
of Bdranger," Mr. John R. Spears's " The Story of 
a Lost Car," Professor Boyesen's "The Two Mol- 
lies," and Miss Margaret Crosby's " The Copeland 
Collection." This year brings us, in the same 
magazine's fiction number, a characteristic story by 
the new Ambassador to Italy, " George's Baptism," 
which, like "Marse Chan," presents the ever amus- 
ing and likable Southern darky as no one better 
than Mr. Thomas Nelson Page knows how to depict 
him. Other stories by popular authors in the same 
issue are "The Old Order Changes," "The Mean 
Pi-Ray te," "Wood-Ladies," "The Pagan," "The 
Bird in the Bush," and "Sonnie-Boy's People." 
This month of August is the right time for quoting 
from "The Newarker" that eminently quotable 
" house organ," as it calls itself, of the Newark 
Public Library the following defence of fiction- 
reading : " Almost all the men who work as if they 
liked it, who move quickly, who use their brains and 
have brains to use, and who get things done, are 
fond of reading novels. I conclude from this that 
the story-teller has always had the attention of the 
wise men of his generation just as he has their 
attention now. I also conclude that the writer of 
novels to-day is as little harmful and as greatly 
cheering and helpful to vigorous and competent 
workers to-day as was the story-teller in generations 
past. Some find the romance too strong for their 
blood ; but this argues nothing against the excellence 
of romance. Let the weak refrain from taking that 
which does not fit their constitutions, and let them 
leave to all others their choice of books." The 
closing words recall Darwin's professed inability to 
read novels because they excited him unduly and 
interfered with the calm and regular prosecution of 
his proper work ; also Mrs. Howe's way of stopping 
the reading aloud of a too-harrowing story in her 
home circle, and her exclamation, " It is too dread- 
ful, I cannot bear it ! " We are reminded also of a 
very busy and energetic worker by day who relaxes 
the tension at night with allopathic doses of fiction 
of the most sensational character " garbage " he 
calls it, in good-natured derision. 



THE LOSS OF A PRICELESS MANUSCRIPT forms the 
subject of a Lincoln anecdote that is being told in 
this semi-centennial year of the great Gettysburg 
fight, and is especially worthy of repeating since 
the recent reproduction in a New York journal of 
what was alleged to be the original draft of the 



72 



THE DIAL 



[August 1 



famous address, one of the classics of American lit- 
erature, delivered by Lincoln on the field of Gettys- 
burg. This reproduction, showing the White House 
stationery, clashes violently with the familiar tradi- 
tion that the speech was scribbled in haste on the 
back of an old envelope, while the speaker was on 
his way to the scene of its delivery ; but the discrep- 
ancy is explained by a son of the late Horatio King 
of New York. He says that in 1897 he went with 
his father to call upon Andrew G. Curtin, the old 
war governor of Pennsylvania, and that Governor 
Curtin told them of his having been one of the 
party that accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg, and 
that on the journey the President asked him if he 
had any writing paper. To this the other answered 
that he had not, but offered him several addressed 
envelopes, which he cut open in order to make more 
writing space. Lincoln took them and withdrew to 
a separate seat, where he busied himself with his 
pencil, but returned to Curtin just before Gettysburg 
was reached, and, handing the scraps of paper to 
his obliging friend, asked him to have a clean copy 
made of what he had written. This was done at a 
hotel, and the transcript handed to Lincoln, after 
which, as Governor Curtin expressed it, "like a 

d d fool I threw the slips away. They would be 

priceless now." Mr. King offers the explanation 
that Lincoln had probably left his original manu- 
script behind him by mistake and wrote the penciled 
draft from memory. Another possible explanation 
would be that he wrote out the White House copy 
after the delivery of the speech. A careful com- 
parison of the address as delivered and reported 
with this still extant copy in Lincoln's hand has of 
course long ago been made, and the findings of this 
examination might perhaps be turned to account in 
throwing some light on the question in dispute. 

THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING BUREAU 
IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS ought to be of great 
service in securing greater simplicity and uniformity 
and consistency in the bills introduced into the two 
houses of our national legislature. The defeat of 
so useful a measure is hardly conceivable, although 
the unexpected opposition encountered in the Senate 
illustrates once more that august body's fondness 
for silly and senseless obstruction. One of the con- 
script fathers has even felt it his duty to rise in his 
place and denounce the bill as "the most astonishing 
piece of legislation I have ever heard proposed in 
this body." The mere drafting of bills, as Senator 
Root explained in introducing the measure, would 
not be the only or most important function of the 
proposed bureau. This bureau would hunt up and 
digest all literature in the Library pertaining to 
the bill in hand. "The fundamental idea" of the 
so-called Owen act for establishing the bureau, Mr. 
Root made clear, " is to give the benefit of a trained, 
experienced student in the preparation of bills ; not 
to take a bill after it has been passed upon, but to 
perform the function which is now performed to 
great advantage by the officers who are called 



counsel in the British House of Commons. The 
idea is to have a more or less permanent officer 
who is familiar with existing legislation and with 
the decisions of the courts, who can take a measure 
that has been drafted with the slender opportunity 
for examination and research which we have here, 
and see how it fits into the existing laws of the coun- 
try and what its effect will be under the existing 
decisions of the courts, and suggest better, clearer, 
more unambiguous, and more effective forms of 
expression." This is no leap in the dark, such as 
might inspire excusable terror in a timid Senate ; it 
is something that has already been tried in several 
of the State legislatures, if we mistake not notably 
in that of Wisconsin. 

VEST POCKET LIBRARIES seem to be rendered pos- 
sible by Dr. Francois Dussaud's invention of " cold 
light," as described by him in "Harper's Magazine" 
for July. A light that is more economic of electric 
energy than the ordinary incandescent burner is 
produced by making the pulsations or waves inter- 
mittent instead of continuous, thus greatly reducing 
the radiation of heat without diminution of light. 
Heat being thus largely eliminated, a greater con- 
centration of light on the inflammable celluloid 
film used in photography is made possible ; and the 
celluloid negative of a book-page, for instance, can 
be of almost microscopic dimensions and still easily 
thrown onto a screen in such size as to be readable. 
A year's issue of Figaro, says the inventor, can be 
packed away in negatives occupying no more space 
than a match; and the volumes for a quarter of a 
century can thus be put into a cigarette-case. A 
dozen large books could be photgraphed easily and 
cheaply, page after page on a continuous film, and 
the negatives tucked into the vest-pocket without 
making it bulge uncomfortably, whereas a dozen 
men would be required to carry the same number 
of glass negatives. Certain European libraries, says 
Dr. Dussaud, have already made arrangements for 
the exchange of rare volumes in this way, in pho- 
tographic facsimile. Both the photographing and 
the reproducing apparatus appear to be inexpensive, 
of small bulk, and easily managed. May it not be 
that we have here a solution of the problem with 
which libraries are now confronted in the portentous 
accumulation of the increasingly enormous product of 
the printing-press ? One seems to hear the groaning 
bookshelves utter a sigh of expectant relief at this 
prospect of vest-pocket libraries in the near future. 

THE MAN OF A HUNDRED BOOKS, carefully selected 
and thoughtfully read, is a well-educated man. So 
said Mr. Philander Claxton, United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, at the recent annual conference 
of American educators at Salt Lake City. This was 
at the joint session of the library and rural schools 
departments of the National Educational Associ- 
ation, at which the subject for discussion was "The 
Library in its Relation to the Rural Community." 
Commissioner Claxton declared literature to be the 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



73 



most important of all school subjects, and then as- 
serted that whoever will read thoughtfully four good 
books a year will be well educated when he has read 
one hundred. Such persons are invaluable to their 
respective communities, they are open to progress, 
and they have windows in their souls. Mr. Claxton 
made an eloquent plea for the county library system. 
He stated that of the thirty-five hundred counties 
in the United States, twenty-two hundred have no 
library of five thousand volumes. Notable also was 
the address of Mr. Ole Rice, State Library Clerk of 
Wisconsin, who gave some interesting information 
about rural school libraries in his State. Teachers 
are required to pass an examination showing their 
understanding of such principles of library science 
and the use of books as will enable them to direct 
the reading of their pupils a branch of the teacher's 
equipment which Mr. Rice considers more important 
than algebra. In speaking of the selection of books 
for children, he incidentally exposed one fault in the 
ordinary story of school life : the scene is commonly 
laid in a boarding-school, not in the public school, 
and thus a desire to leave home is often unwisely 
planted in the public school pupil's breast. Herein 
may lie a valuable hint to the writer of juvenile 
fiction. ... 

AN OLD REVIEW UNDER NEW EDITORSHIP SOme- 

times takes a fresh lease of life with the changed 
conditions, and sometimes does not. What will be 
the result of the reorganization of " The Saturday 
Review," which is to go into effect at the end of 
August, remains to be seen. Mr. Harold Hodge, 
its editor for fourteen years past, is to yield his chair 
to the chief proprietor, the Hon. Gervase Beckett, 
M.P., who will be assisted by Mr. George A. B. 
Dewar as literary editor. Famous from the begin- 
ning for its addiction to caustic comment and un- 
sparing criticism one might appropriately call it 
" The Saturday Slasher," in view of the tone of its 
book-reviews this well-known London weekly has 
in its time enlisted the services of many of England's 
best writers. Freeman's excoriations of certain un- 
lucky authors made lively reading in the good old 
days ; Leslie Stephen also wrote frequently for the 
paper ; and J. R. Green contributed some admirable 
sketches of historic towns, and many other articles 
of value. The present political situation in England 
is thought to offer the " Saturday " a rare oppor- 
tunity to recover much of its lost prestige. 

THE FASCINATION OF THE FOLDER, glowingly 

descriptive of some railway route or steamboat line 
or summer resort, and lavishly illustrated with the 
most captivating scenes, a mountain landscape, 
the broad piazza of a palatial seaside hotel, the hand- 
somely upholstered interior of a Pullman palace car, 
the incredible vastness of a steamboat dining-room, 
or the voluptuous comfort of the same vessel's private 
suites of rooms, would be irresistible were it not 
that each fresh one coming to hand seems more allur- 
ing, more full of promise, than the last, so that, after 



the manner of Buridan's ass, only more harassed by 
conflicting desires than that poor beast, one balances 
the equiponderant attractions of mountain and sea- 
shore, or of grandly scenic railroad route and softly 
seductive sea voyage, and perhaps ends by staying 
at home and confining one's summer travel to an 
arm-chair perusal of half a hundred of these 
artistically-made publications of the transportation 
companies and the hotel men. As it is a common 
experience to meet a man who, one feels sure, can- 
not possibly be as wise as he looks, so one is haunted 
by a doubt whether any of these beautifully-depicted 
routes of travel and resorts of wealth and leisure can 
be in reality what they seem in printed appearance. 
Better, perhaps, not to dispel the illusion. Better 
to let Elmwood Heights or Sunset Lake or Idyl 
Island remain in the mind's eye the perfect para- 
dise it purports to be than to risk the disenchantment 
of actuality. Thus the folder becomes harmless lit- 
erature to him who has wisdom and restraint, its 
seductions seduce only in imagination, and one 
watches with interest each season its developing 
charms, its more artfully paraded attractions and 
allurements. ... 

THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE INDEX ExPURGA- 

TORIUS is that spirited romance of Elizabethan 
times and Elizabethan mariners, " Westward Ho ! " 
The school committee of Boston has held earnest 
debate over Kingsley's masterpiece and decreed that 
it shall be dropped from the supplementary reading 
list of the Boston high schools because, as we gather, 
the author's treatment of the religious controversies 
of the time is likely to cause offense. Undoubtedly 
there is much with which readers of certain preju- 
dices and upbringing might disagree in the Anglican 
writer's earnest utterance on certain points over 
which men have argued and fought for centuries; 
but what romance-hungry young reader is going to 
let that fact spoil the story for him or her? The 
condemned passages are more than likely to be 
skipped in any case, or to be hurried over with no 
thought but for the progress of the fortunes of 
Amyas Leigh. Truly, if Kingsley is dangerous read- 
ing, we had better confine our youths and maidens to 
the reading of " Sandford and Merton " and " The 
Parent's Assistant," and bar their approach to the 
public library. ... 

A PREMIUM UPON ILLITERACY might almost serve 
as a designation of that provision of the Underwood 
tariff bill which, now that the Senators have tinkered 
it to their satisfaction, removes from the free list 
"books and pamphlets chiefly in languages other 
than English." Stupid and harmful and utterly 
indefensible as was the original provision for taxing 
imported English books (with some grudging excep- 
tions in favor of libraries and schools), this imposing 
of a duty on non-English books is an imposition 
indeed. Our last state will be worse than our first 
if this witless clause becomes a law ; for hitherto 
the advanced student could keep abreast of conti- 
nental European scholarship in his department with-

out being fined for his alertness and zeal, and the 
book-loving immigrant could send home for litera- 
ture in his native German or Swedish or Hungarian 
or other language (except English) and rejoice in 
his exemption from those custom-house formalities 
and delays and expenses that hamper and exasper- 
ate the purchaser of foreign books printed in En- 
glish. The window tax of early times was a senseless 
attempt to collect a revenue on light and air, bodily 
necessities, and deserved all the reprobation it re- 
ceived ; but this laying of a duty on the light and 
air of the soul and intellect bespeaks a density of 
blockheadedness (to call it nothing worse) that 
fairly passes conception. The authorship of this 
masterpiece of solemn stupidity has been intimated 
in the reports from Washington, but the name shall 
not here be held up to ridicule and infamy. It is 
to be hoped that early legislative or executive action 
will save that name from going down to posterity as 
a synonym for all that is smallest and stupidest, most 
reactionary and most injurious, in tariff legislation. 


THE NOVELIST IN QUEST OK HIS MATERIAL is too 

often tempted, especially in his beginning years, to 
go far afield. Ignotum pro magnifico seems to be 
the actuating principle before the eyes have been 
opened to the marvel and mystery of the familiar. 
When one reads in the columns of literary gossip 
that a certain novelist is going to Transylvania or 
Mesopotamia to obtain local color for his new book, 
the thoughtful person's impulse is to advise him to 
stay at home and try to get his eyes open to the 
local color that is all about him. But there is a 
proverb about the eyes of a fool being in the ends 
of the earth, and our headstrong young novelist 
would of course refuse to listen to any such well- 
meant counsel. Let us quote here the words of one 
veteran novelist, as they may convey a hint as to 
how he gathers his material for his fiction without 
journeying to the ends of the earth for it. In a 
conversation reported very lately by Mr. George 
Newell Lovejoy for the Springfield " Republican " 
Mr. Ho wells says : " I was never very strong bodily ; 
I have always been obliged to use my strength 
guardedly, so to speak, and yet I have been able to 
accomplish a great deal. I always endeavor to be 
systematic in all that I do. I usually pass my after- 
noons out of doors, walking, meeting people, observ- 
ing in a natural way all that is to be seen. I never 
tire walking our busy streets and meeting people of 
all nationalities. It is all so interesting to me ; and, 
do you know, I regard New York as far more inter- 
esting as a city than London or Paris. Here is a 
world in itself, of business activity and progress in 
all directions." The story-writer's kingdom, like 
the kingdom of heaven, is probably much nearer 

home than he at first suspects.

PROVISION FOR THE LITERARY NEEDS OF AUS- 
TRALIAN SAILORS employed on Australian coasting 
vessels is made in the navigation act recently passed 
by the Australian Federal Parliament. Character- 



istic of the radical and usually highly enlightened 
legislation of that young commonwealth is the clause 
requiring all ships licensed for the coasting trade to 
pay standard Australian wages to the men employed, 
while in Australian waters, and also to allow them 
free use of the books in the ship's library unless a 
separate library has been provided for their benefit. 
Thus the merchant marine is being educated up to 
that praiseworthy and doubtless profitable practice 
of giving the sailor an antidote to the deadly tedium 
of a life on the ocean wave, which is now observed 
in the up-to-date navy. Ere long we shall expect 
to see our library schools offering special courses in 
marine bibliothecology, or library science for sea- 
farers. ... 

A RE-INTERPRETATION OF THE CLASSICS, as Mr. 

Henry Dwight Sedgwick points out in his dialogue 
on "The Classics Again" in "The Atlantic Monthly" 
for July, is urged upon us by the issue of "The 
Loeb Classical Library." In the dialogue referred 
to, one of the speakers remarks: "My point was 
that we accept the classics upon a wholly traditional 
valuation; and I was going to add that one of the 
great services which Mr. Loeb's classical library 
renders is that we are morally obliged to look at the 
classics, so far as possible, with our own eyes and 
make up our own minds about them. We must take 
the word classical down from its pedestal and see 
what it really means." With all the Greek and 
Latin classics put before us in a uniform edition and 
accompanied by a page-f or-page English translation, 
the old excuse of rustiness in our ancient languages, 
or the plea that the Greek and Latin authors are not 
readily available in satisfactory form, will no longer 
hold. An authoritative vernacular rendering, with 
the original on the adjoining page to help one to re- 
capture at least some flavor of the author's style, is 
all that could be desired for an intelligent re-reading 
of our long-neglected Virgil and Homer, Tacitus and 
Thucydides. In a certain quarter, which need not 
here be named, protest has been made against reading 
the accepted masterpieces of literature simply be- 
cause they are accounted " classics." Now is the time 
and the opportunity to determine anew, every reader 
for himself, whether they deserve that designation. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A PLAN FOR ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF 

SCANDINAVIAN WRITERS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

At its second annual meeting at Rock Island last 
May, The Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian 
Study defined the functions of its Committee on Trans- 
lations as the authorized literary committee of the 
Society, its members to study old and new English 
translations of Scandinavian writers and publish the 
results of such studies. The Committee was also au- 
thorized to offer the services of its members as special 
readers of manuscript translations to such publishing 
houses as are issuing translations of Scandinavian writ- 
ings: the Society recognizing the inadequacy of most

existing English translations and desiring to cooperate 
with publishers in raising the standard of such English 
translations from the Scandinavian as are issued in this 
country. Publishers wishing to avail themselves of this 
service should correspond with the undersigned; final 
arrangements, however, should always be made with 
the individual member of the committee whose services 
are desired. 

The Committee was also asked to make some effort 
to have new Scandinavian publications adequately re- 
viewed in American journals. 

The personnel of the Committee is as follows: Dr. 
A. LeRoy Andrews, Cornell University; Mr. W. N. C. 
Carlton, the Newberry Library; Dr. Chester N. Gould, 
the University of Chicago; Mr. Aksel G. S. Josephson, 
the John Crerar Library; Dr. L. N. Larson, the Univer- 
sity of Illinois; and Dr. Henry C. Leach, the American- 
Scandinavian Foundation.

LITERATURE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE. 
("To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Miss Corinne Bacon, head of the Drexel Institute 
Library School of Philadelphia, I read in a recent issue 
of THE DIAL, declares that literature is of little worth 
as a substitute for life, and asks why it is necessarily a 
good thing to read at all : " Is there anything sacrosanct 
about print ? Why is it considered a virtue to read ? " 

She further inquires if it would not be a good thing 
for many of us to deal more with first-hand things and 
less with second-hand thoughts. She concludes with 
the remark: " At the best, books are but a substitute 
for life." 

To this THE DIAL replies that one may have both 
life and literature, but that if it were necessary to choose 
one should, of course, choose life. 

This seems to me a feeble answer to a foolish ques- 
tion. It is impossible to choose literature as a substitute 
for life. We all must live, however closely we seclude 
ourselves. What Miss Bacon really means is, that we 
should learn of life from people rather than from books. 

Now, in the first place, books are not a substitute for 
life at all ; on the contrary, they are a part, and a very 
important part, of life. We can learn at first-hand only 
as much of life as we encounter in personal experience. 
This knowledge is necessarily limited. If we could 
know only of those places which we view with our own 
eyes, most of us would be shockingly deficient in our 
knowledge of geography. We acquire our knowledge 
of life exactly as a doctor acquires his knowledge of 
medicine or surgery, partly by personal experience or 
experimentation, but chiefly by making our own the 
knowledge, the observation, and the experience of others. 
It is extremely unlikely that I shall ever visit Iceland, 
yet because others have done so and have recorded that 
experience in books, I know that Iceland exists. It is 
quite easy for me to become familiar with many of the 
physical characteristics of that country, its climate, its 
geological formation, its waterways, and so on, without 
going outside of my own door. The same thing is true 
of its social characteristics. This knowledge may be 
of great value to me or it may not. One thing is cer- 
tain: it can do me no harm. It is the same with all 
others matters of knowledge. 

Why, asks Miss Bacon, is it considered a virtue to 
read? It is not considered a virtue to read useless, 



inaccurate, frivolous, aimless literature; nobody will 
contend that it is so considered. There is nothing vir- 
tuous in the mere act of reading, any more than there 
is anything virtuous in the mere act of guiding a pen 
across paper. The virtue of reading lies in the desire 
to learn, just as the virtue of laboring lies in the desire 
to be useful. To learn is to become efficient ; to be effi- 
cient is to be of use ; to be of use is to be virtuous. The 
very desire to be of use is commendable. To deny this 
is to deny every principle of Christian or even of civil- 
ized ethics; nay, of any and all ethics known to man. 
Stupidity is a misfortune, but torpidity is a crime. 

To the question whether it would not be better for 
many of us to deal more with first-hand things and less 
with second-hand thoughts, I should answer no. There 
are not many of us who are more concerned with books 
than with men, and I do not believe the world would 
be any better if the few who devote themselves to litera- 
ture were to abandon it. It is well to remember that 
" Men may be read, as well as books, too much." If 
our young people were content to learn more from books 
and less from life, we should not have so many social 
problems to vex us. The source of most of our present 
trouble with " the social evil " lies in the fact that so 
few young people are willing to believe what they are 
told until they have put it to the test. Literature teaches 
that vice carries penalties. Life teaches the same les- 
son; but tuition in the school of experience is high, and 
of those who insist upon learning in that school there are 
few who are fortunate enough to graduate with honors.

THE WIDENER LIBRARY AND THE 

HARVARD "YARD." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It seems as though there would have been many 
voices of wail or of protest from Harvard men all over 
the country if the conception had been grasped of what 
the college yard is to look like, when the beautiful but 
perfectly unassimilable new library building is com- 
pleted. The effect will approximate that of the olla 
podrida of Copley Square in Boston, but with no excuse, 
since authority could have controlled harmony in the 
Cambridge precincts. The old library building was pretty 
bad, though familiarized by custom. Since its destruc- 
tion the ensemble has been much improved, but of course 
the conditions are short-lived. With the Widener struc- 
ture, the last state will be worse than the first; while 
the imagination has had an opportunity to picture what 
the grouping might be of a sympathetic edifice in the 
colonial manner that is our birthright, with University, 
beautiful Holden, Massachusetts, Stoughton, Hollis, Hoi- 
worthy, and old President's house. What might have 
been done is demonstrated in the new Freshman dormi- 
tories but they are a quarter of a mile from the yard. 

Why should not wealthy givers and devisers be 
limited in their erections with a living environment, as 
they are among the dwellings of the dead in well con- 
ducted cemeteries? In the present instance the donor's 
architect has been slavishly permitted to inflict upon the 
eye in the new building a style which is a hemisphere 
and a thousand years away from its neighbors ! 

It is well that Charles Eliot Norton, whose heart was 
half-broken by other incongruities, should have been 
spared this crowning one. ERVING WlNSLOW>

THE CROWDED LIFE OF A WOMAN 
OF LETTERS.* 



Dexterous weaver of fiction though Mrs. 
Barr is, the loom that produced "Jan Vedder's 
Wife" and The Bow of Orange Kibbon " did 
not reveal its full capacity until the fabric of 
this popular novelist's real life, rich in color and 
elaborate in pattern, was given to her readers. 
"All the Days of My Life," as she names her 
autobiography, is a book more packed with in- 
cident and adventure, with strokes of good and 
ill fortune, with joy and sorrow, love and long- 
ing, strange coincidences, curious omens and 
warnings, and a variety of unusual experiences 
ranging from the comic to the tragic, than any 
romance that has come from the autobiographer's 
prolific pen. Especially interesting and signifi- 
cant are the inner experiences, the spiritual 
agonies and ecstasies, that have fallen to Mrs. 
Barr's lot, and that she relates with a noble can- 
dor and dignity that make them most impressive. 
When she tells us in her preface that not one 
of several apparent motives named by her has 
been the impelling motive in prompting her to 
write her life-story, and that the real reason 
must reveal itself to the reader, the inference 
must be that it is for the sake of its spiritual 
meaning, its lessons in the deeper things of the 
soul, that the book is sent out to the world. Its 
general tone and character are indicated in the 
very opening paragraph of the first chapter. 

" I entered this incarnation on March the twenty- 
ninth, A. D. 1831, at the ancient town of Ulverston, 
Lancashire, England. My soul came with me. This is 
not always the case. Every observing mother of a large 
family knows that the period of spiritual possession 
varies. For days, even weeks, the child may be entirely 
of the flesh, and then suddenly, in the twinkling of an 
eye, the mystery of the indwelling spirit is accomplished. 
This miracle comes not by observation; no mother ever 
saw it take place. She only knows that at one moment 
her child was ignorant of her; that at the next moment 
it was consciously smiling into her face, and that then, 
with an instinctive gladness, she called to the whole 
household, ' the baby has begun to notice.' I brought 
my soul with me an eager soul, impatient for the loves 
and joys, the struggles and triumphs of the dear, unfor- 
gotten world." 

These loves and joys, struggles and triumphs, 
were not long in beginning. Amelia Huddle- 
ston, daughter of a Methodist preacher, had that

Illustrated. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



variety of scene in her family life that comes to 
every household whose head is subject to the 
marching orders of a bishop of this denomination. 
Ulverston, Shipley, Penrith, Kipon, Castletown 
in the Isle of Man, and Whitehaven are named 
as places successively dwelt in by the migratory 
preacher and his family. About two years' 
experience of teaching fell naturally to the lot 
of the bright and intellectual and rather pre- 
cocious Amelia, and at nineteen she married 
Robert Barr, a prosperous and promising young 
business man of Glasgow. But within three 
years certain mishaps in his commercial under- 
takings prompted the young husband to emi- 
grate with his wife and their two daughters to 
America, where began a series of wanderings 
and of struggles with adversity, brightened with 
occasional gleams of prosperity, that ended 
only with Mr. Barr's death from yellow fever at 
Galveston, where two young sons likewise fell 
victims to the epidemic, and the widow with 
three surviving daughters, out of eight children 
that had been born within sixteen years, was left 
to support her family as best she could. New 
York was soon chosen as the scene of this 
struggle for existence, and after some essays in 
another direction writing was adopted as the 
calling most likely to prove both congenial and 
remunerative. Periodicals like "The Chris- 
tian Union," "Harper's Weekly," "The New 
York Ledger," and "The Illustrated Christian 
Weekly," as also, later, some of the best monthly 
magazines, showed themselves hospitable to the 
offerings of the new writer; and though there 
were times when her purse became alarmingly 
light, and in one such season of stress her dearest 
piece of jewelry, a diamond ring placed on her 
finger by Robert Barr in the old Glasgow days, 
had to be turned into food and raiment, the 
plucky young authoress won through unaided 
except by the offices of friendship, and climbed 
steadily and rather rapidly to that high rung 
on the ladder of literary fame whereon she now 
stands secure. 

Passing over the varied incidents that make 
the first half of Mrs. Barr's book interesting and 
even thrilling, to the point of sensationalism, 
omitting the Chicago and Memphis and Texas 
episodes, which must be read in full as she 
herself has narrated them, we choose for special 
notice here a few events and associations from 
her literary life in New York, and will quote an 
early passage illustrating the manner of that life 
as ordered by her soon after she had got her 
bearings in the new environment.

" As soon as the house affairs were arranged, I went 
down to the Christian Union office. I took with me a 
paper called 'The Epiphany in the West Riding.' There 
was a Mr. Kennedy then in the working editor's chair, 
and he read it at once and was delighted with it. He 
had such generous words of encouragement and praise, 
that I have yet the kindest memory of him. He was 
the first editor of the Christian Union, I believe, but he 
left the paper very soon, and I have never heard his 
name since. 

" Mr. George Merriam followed him, and he was the 
kindest and wisest editor I ever wrote for. He kept 
me rigorously up to my best work, but did so with such 
consideration and valuable advice, that I always felt it 
a great pleasure to see how much better I could make 
everything I wrote for him. He did me many favors, 
and among them he gave me my first introduction to 
the dear old Astor Library. In this library I worked 
from morning to night. Mr. Saunders the head librarian 
was an Englishman, a most wonderful general scholar, 
particularly intimate with English literature. We soon 
became good friends, and he gave me the use of one of 
the largest and sunniest alcoves in the Hall I frequented. 
For fifteen years I used this alcove with its comfortably 
large table, its silence and sunshine, and delightful 
atmosphere of books and scholars." 

She says further of this alcove that "though 
it exists no longer, I see it as plainly as I saw it 
before it existed at all" and proceeds to explain 
the italicized words by recounting how as a child 
of seven or eight at Penrith she had dreams of 
this pleasant nook in the big library and saw it 
in as definite detail as later when she actually 
entered it. The reminiscence is characteristic, 
for the book abounds in similar instances of 
strange coincidence, to call it nothing more, and 
curious premonition. Mrs. Barr has all her life 
either been the victim of superstition or been 
endowed with unusual psychic powers. Some 
will explain the apparently supernatural parts of 
her history in one way, some in another ; but the 
simple, straightforward, unpretentious manner 
in which they are related disposes one to credit 
her with the strictest conscientiousness and care 
in her narrative, and to join with her in assigning 
to some little-understood cause or agency the 
otherwise inexplicable occurrences in her event- 
ful life. 

Among the glimpses of many persons of note 
which the book gives us, the following will serve 
as a welcome addendum to a recent biography 
of more than passing interest. 

" About this time the brilliant scholar Moses Coit 
Tyler was editor of the Christian Union. He was a 
great man in every respect. If he only entered a room, 
it appeared to become lighter; and in no other man 
have I ever noticed the radiation of the body so pro- 
nounced. He made me believe in the aureoles of the 
saints. Reverent to sacred things, he was still very 
much of an every-day man. He fearlessly spoke his 
mind, fearlessly opposed what he disapproved; and 
was not, I suspected, an admirer of Mr. Beecher. I 



remember thinking that if the two men came to an 
active dispute, I should like to be present. Professor 
Tyler soon left the newspaper world, and went to his 
place in Michigan University. Many years afterwards 
he wrote me some hearty letters, praising the work I 
had done, and telling me he knew I would do better 
still." 

As illustrating Mrs. Barr's industry, the 
record of her year's work for 1882, while she 
was still comparatively new to her calling, is 
significant. It includes " one hundred and 
thirty-one poems, eight stories, two of which 
were long enough to be called novelettes, and 
twenty-five articles referring mostly to remark- 
able people, places or events." Concerning 
the year 1899 we find a note that further 
strengthens confidence in the writer as a truthful 
historian, sane of mind and calm of judgment. 
She says: 

" The first three months the doctor forbid me to 
write, and I amused myself by reading everything I 
could find on the new cults and ' isms ' then clamoring 
for recognition. Theosophy for a few weeks fascinated 
me, but Christian Science never for one hour made any 
impression. I thought it only a huge misunderstanding 
of the Bible. Spiritualism I had examined many years 
previously, and discarded its pretentions at once. Truly 
God speaks to men, but when He so favors any soul, 
He asks no dollar fee, and needs no darkened room, 
veiled cabinet, nor yet any hired medium to interpret His 
message. . . . And when I had satisfied my foolish 
curiosity, I was sorry and ashamed, and with deep con- 
trition asked only to be permitted to say once more, 
' Our Father /' Going back to my Bible was like going 
back home, after being lost in a land of darkness and 
despair." 

Mrs. Barr is eloquent in pleading the cause 
of women. "I am for the enfranchisement of 
every slave," she declares. " I am for justice, 
even to women." All the more remarkable, 
therefore, is the fact of her evident sympathy 
with the South in the war for the negro slave's 
emancipation. But her home was then in the 
South, which explains much. In the style of her 
book one cannot fail to note, in addition to what 
are manifestly printer's errors, rather frequent 
proofs of her frankly confessed ignorance of 
grammar, which in this instance includes punc- 
tuation. Almost any schoolgirl, however, can 
easily master the rules of grammar ; not one in 
a hundred thousand can achieve Mrs. Barr's 
well-deserved fame in literature. Her book is 
well supplied with portraits, and has a view of 
her home on the Hudson, "Cherry Croft." It 
is more variously interesting, richer in romance 
and strange adventure, than is usual with the 
lives of literary folk. It holds the reader under 
its spell from beginning to end.

THE MYSTERY OF DREAMS.* 

In the Interpreter's house are many mansions, 
and of these the seat of dreams is one of the 
most extraordinary, as to disorder. The dream 
has been, to the interpreter, everything, from 
a revelation of the mysteries and a portent of 
the fates, to the efflux of a feast celebrated not 
wisely but too well. Interpretations have sped 
with fancy or crawled with fact, ever outrunning 
or falling short of that needful conspectus of 
the whole dream, which so envisages at once its 
character, cause, and effects that the whole and 
each part may by means of the vision be pro- 
duced, destroyed, increased, minimized, directed, 
controlled. In bald English, there has been no 
satisfactory science of dreams. 

Now comes Freud with the joyful gospel of 
such a science, with the claim to dispel the mys- 
tery and to give law to the fact. In his gospel, 
the ancient role of the dream is topsy-turvied. 
First of all, it is not a disturber of sleep ; it is 
a protector of sleep. Then it is not providence 
of the future; it is reminiscence of the past. 
And finally, it is not a punishment or reward 
determined from without ; it is the fulfilment 
of some wish, determined from within. Dreams 
are at once defence, purgation, and satisfaction, 
the mind's device to protect itself against itself. 
The mind's device to protect itself against 
itself! It is the inward discrepancy of the 
stream of life that is the point of departure of 
this theory. Freud accepts the popular, and 
for that matter the philosophic and religious, 
conceptions of human nature as a conflict be- 
tween a higher and a lower part. To Plato, 
for example, man is at once a protean beast, a 
lion and a man, and man, with the help of the 
lion, must rule the beast and keep it obedient. 
To Christian opinion man is at once flesh and 
spirit, and the former must be chastened that 
the latter may maintain its righteous own. To 
modern humanitarian sentiment man is head and 
heart, and each must hold the other in check. 
To contemporary psychology, a similar inner 
conflict is apparent ; not, however, as an eternal 
triangle, or di-wrangle, but as a vast pluralism. 
The mind is conceived as an assemblage of con- 
flicting interests, impulsions, desires, feelings, 
each with its own adherents, associates, and 
emotional tone, each tending to fill the field of 
consciousness, to dominate the waking life and 
to constitute the actual character of the person

man edition, with introduction, by A. A. Brill, Ph.B.. M.D.

whose life it so constrains. Any one of these 
active centres is called in the Freudian termin- 
ology a " psychic complex," and it is such com- 
plexes that he makes the units of explanation 
in his theory of dreams. 

Their essence is that they are not and cannot 
be at peace with one another, that they make of 
our minds a theatre and of our lives a drama 
of which they are at once the protagonists and 
directors. And the catastrophe of this unceas- 
ing drama is always that one or more of those 
"complexes" is driven from the stage of the 
overt life. It may be that external conditions 
the social order, commercial necessity, intel- 
lectual urgency, allies of other "complexes" 
will drive it off ; it may be that its own intrinsic 
unpleasantness will banish it, put it out of mind; 
but whatever the cause, it is put out. Putting 
it out does not, however, end the drama ; putting 
it out serves only to complicate the drama. For 
the "new psychology" shows that whenever an 
interest or desire or impulsion is put out of the 
mind, it is really put into the mind ; it is driven 
from the conscious level of existence to the 
unconscious level, but it is not destroyed. It 
retains its force and direction, only its work 
now lies underground. Its life henceforward 
consists partly in a direct oppugnance to the 
inhibitions that keep it down, partly in burrow- 
ing beneath and around them and seeking out 
unwonted channels of escape. Under these con- 
ditions of the mind's drama the protagonists get 
new names. The fellow in the cellarage is called 
by Freud the "lower instance," the visible 
Hamlet on the stage, the "upper instance" or 
"censor." Whatever henceforth ensues tends 
to be the outcome of a compromise between the 
censor and the lower instance. Hysteria, wit, 
and dreams are some of the compromises that 
emerge. They are the armed neutrality of 
these inveterate enemies. 

This they are, yet not so simply. For life 
is long and suppressions accumulate, until the 
mass of our existence of feeling and desire tends 
to be composed entirely of lower instances, layer 
upon layer, and every complex in the layer 
striving to enter the daylight of consciousness 
without disguises. Disguise it must have, how- 
ever; and when by virtue of the disguise, it 
appears in dream, it appears not alone, but in a 
fellowship in which the suppressions of infancy 
are likely to be even more important than those 
of later life. Dreams tend to gratify the whole 
of our mentality of the cellarage without offense 
to the censor. 

To the technique of this gratification, Freud 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



79 



assigns the term "dream-work," distinguishing 
in it the processes of "over-determination," or 
"condensation," "displacement," and "sec- 
ondary elaboration." These are, so to speak, 
the devices in the makeup of the disguised sup- 
pression, which under its makeup goes by the 
name of "latent dream content." The stuff of 
the makeup is derived from the day's events. 

The overt dream which disguises this " con- 
tent " is over and above everything else a thing 
seen ; it is a vision, and an enacted vision. 
Consequently it can contain little that is literal 
or direct ; every one of its elements tends to be 
an indirection and a symbol. It cannot, to 
begin with, as an enactment, directly present 
the past : the past must be symbolized by some 
present dream-event. It cannot, again, present 
abstractions, like logical relations, such as if, 
but, because, and so on ; these again must be 
symbolized by some concrete dramatic dream 
sequence: thoughts appear as actions. 

This concretion of abstractions, into dominant 
visual and dramatic terms is the most imme- 
diate attribute of the " dream-work." Now each 
element of the explicit content of the dream 
may be, and generally is, the gratification of a 
large number of suppressed wishes ; it is thus 
as Freud says, " over-determined," a "conden- 
sation " of the multitude into its visual unity, 
and in this way a symbol of them all. Again, 
what it symbolizes, be it remembered, is out- 
lawed from the waking life. In order that it 
may pass the censor it must not only be dis- 
guised, it must be disguised in innocency. To 
attain such disguise means to substitute the 
trivial for the important, to enter consciousness, 
if I may say so, tangentially. Such substitu- 
tion and tangentiality is what Freud means by 
" displacement." This, together with over- 
determination and condensation, is the direct 
product of the suppressed complexes. The role 
of the censor in the creation of the dream-drama 
has been thus far only inhibitive and regulative. 
Its positive contribution consists of certain in- 
terpolations and amplifications which give the 
dream a superficial coherence and rationality. 
This contribution Freud calls " secondary elab- 
oration." It can be distinguished from the fig- 
ments of the suppressed wishes in that it is more 
easily forgettable, is not so vivid, and serves, 
as a rule, to connect and unify outlying or dis- 
crepant portions of the dream. 

This service resolves on slight scrutiny into 
absurdities. Dreams exhibit moreover not alone 
the paradoxes incidental to secondary elabora- 
tions. These vary with the occasion. One par- 



adox occurs uniformly and regularly in every 
dream. It is that profound and overwhelming 
emotions appear attached to or caused by the 
most trivial and disproportionate things : that 
events most extraordinary in horror or dramatic 
importance seem to evoke pleasure or to leave 
the mind indifferent. The phenonemon is one 
of displacement. Freud explains it by the 
observation that the only unconverted and 
unconvertible element in the dream is its emo- 
tional content, its "affect," as he calls it. This 
comes into the overt life out of the unconscious 
in its original integrity. 

In sum, then, a dream is a vicarious gratifi- 
cation of a suppressed wish by means of sym- 
bolic dramatic action the mechanism of which is 
devised at one and the same time to satisfy the 
subterranean need and to pass the psychic censor. 
The one unchanged actuality in the dream is its 
emotional tone. It will follow inevitably that if 
this formula does envisage the essence of dream- 
life, certain dreams will be common to all man- 
kind, will occur widely, will make use of the 
same symbolism and be interpretable in the 
same way. Freud indicates as such, among a 
possible many others, dreams of flying, falling, 
water-dreams, fire dreams, and so on. The 
analyses of such dreams are not, however, as 
they here appear, convincing. 

This is perhaps due to the fact that Freud 
arrived at his theory of dreams through years 
of clinical treatment of neurasthenics, hysterics, 
and persons of otherwise unnormal mentality. 
He discovered, in the course of this practice, 
that if he caused his patients to explore their 
memories, letting all ideas that arise run a free 
course, absolutely uncensored, they would inevi- 
tably bump on predisposing influences, wishes 
chiefly, and that these, if once faced, would be 
dissipated, and the patient cured, or at least im- 
proved. The treatment is cathartic, its method 
"psychoanalysis." Exposition and proof of 
this theory of dreams is offered as the outcome 
of the method, and the method, conversely, is 
justified by the theory, in terms of numerous 
analyzed dreams. 

The circularity is patent, and aggravated by 
the character of the dream-analyses which con- 
stitute it. There is additional difficulty because 
of the unproved general assumptions concerning 
the behavior of the mind of man from which the 
analyses derive. The assumptions seem to be 
used to justify the analyses, and the analyses to 
ground the assumptions. Again a circle. 

Now these assumptions concern the prepon- 
derant nature of the governing impetus that is the 



80 



THE DIAL 



[August 1 



core of each complex, and the psychic principle 
by which dream-contents and hysteric forms are 
analyzed. In Freud's view the impetus is pre- 
ponderantly sexual ; the principle is that of the 
association of ideas. Both have been violently 
attacked, and the former awakens a natural, 
often a defensory, resentment. It has been said 
that the sex-postulate may hold in Vienna, but 
need not elsewhere, and so ad nauseam. An 
overwhelming presumption in its favor exists 
nevertheless; but it arises from considerations 
quite extraneous to the dream-analyses offered 
in this book. These, too, often seem consciously 
forced and inconclusive, perhaps because of 
Freud's delicacy and reticence about what 
showed itself as actually efficacious and causal, 
perhaps on account of too great compactness, ob- 
scuring relations and connections. Whatever the 
reason, the forcing and inconclusiveness are un- 
questionable. Presumptions favoring the sex- 
postulate come from considerations concerning 
human nature and the character of civilization, 
which depends much on the regulation, control, 
and conversion of sex-impulses. When such 
impulses find a free channel of discharge in 
terms of mind rather than in terms of physical 
instinct they become the power of the creative 
imagination that generates the illusions of 
romantic love; they reenforce with their own 
energies whatever form of the life of the spirit 
they may press themselves into. This mode of 
releasing a suppressed complex by its alliance 
with and reenforcement of a higher and freer 
interest, Freud calls "sublimation," and it is a 
sociological commonplace that civilization is in 
no small degree the "sublimation" of sexual 
energy. But presumption from such considera- 
tions as these is not proof from the consideration 
of dreams, and on the basis of the material Freud 
offers in their interpretation the conclusion to 
their erogenetic character is unwarranted. 

The use of the "law of association of ideas" 
presents together with its advantages peculiar 
difficulties. It permits us, and there is good 
warrant for exercising the privilege, to con- 
ceive the mind as a sort of network of ideas. 
Each is a node from which radiate innumerable 
strands connecting it with other nodes. If, now, 
any one of these nodes has, for whatever reason, 
to be suppressed, it pulls down with it, as it goes 
into the unconscious regions of our mentality, 
very many other nodes. (This, according to 
Freud, is the basis of forgetting and all the 
variety of forms of the " psych opathology of the 
daily life.") The psychoanalytical method con- 
sists simply in getting hold of some node lying 



near the surface and by means of its connecting 
strands lifting to the surface those deeper down. 
Now it is clearly very difficult to determine which 
of these nodes or complexes that is lifted up has 
been the efficacious or significant one in the 
dream. Four-fifths of our lives belongs to the 
unconscious; and if the analyst is persistent or 
clever enough, he can raise up the very lowest 
strata of suppressions, those of our infancy. 
But it is a leap from their unpleasantness, as 
indicated by the resistance to their coming up, 
to their actual activity below the level of con- 
sciousness, and the argument for it has logically 
the character of a circulus in probando. 

Logically, indeed, Freud is open to attacks 
on all sides. It is easy to demonstrate that he 
selects his facts to suit his theory, that his total 
operation is one vast begging of the question. 
It has been done. But it has also been done 
to the Darwinian theory. The ultimate test of 
Freudism lies not in argument but in its clinical 
adequacy, and in the ease and simplicity with 
which it applies to other problems and illumi- 
nates other obscurities in the psychological 
jungle. To me, at least, this "interpretation 
of dreams " is quite acceptable in principle and 
inconclusive in concrete detail. How much this 
may be due to the redundancies and repetitions, 
obscurities of style and confusion of thought, I 
cannot say. The German editions of which 
this book is largely an amplified restatement 
impressed me similarly. They seemed full of 
false starts and wrong scents, the work of a man 
somewhat over-eager to prove something with 
data of whose meaning he was not quite sure. 
This impression is reenforced, in the translation, 
by difficult English, often, in spite of Dr. Brill's 
conscientious efforts and evident pains, En- 
glish that is German, all too German, a diction 
in which literalness is mistaken for accuracy.

THE PLAYBOY OF AMERICAN CRITICS.* 



" The Pathos of Distance " ! Is it merely a 
suggestive title, or is it a confession? Many 
readers of Mr. Huneker's latest book will tend 
toward the confession theory; for despite the 
craft, perhaps even the genius, which .has 
brought together these various papers written 
during twenty years, there is still an outstand- 
ing pathos of distance. They do not strictly 
make a book. The " mellowing of time," be-

and One Moments. By James Huneker. New York : Charles

spoken in their favor, is not always uniform, 
one must remember; for too frequently colors 
fade unequally. The sub-title, "a book of a 
thousand and one moments," is of course a 
genial and ingenious " tale of a tub " thrown out 
to divert the very sort of comment here made. 

In one of the more recent essays, "The 
Playboy of Western Philosophy," the title is a 
boomerang which cuts shrewdly with a double 
edge. The "Playboy" is Professor Bergson; 
and he is a "playboy" because, Mr. Huneker 
says, his philosophy consists of beautiful images 
with which he dazzles our eyes and hypnotizes 
our judgment. The speciousness of this phrase 
proclaims its formulator himself as an image- 
maker, and a maker of false images, too; 
for while there is much clever writing in the 
arraignment of Bergson, no understanding is 
evinced of Bergson's biology. "I recall a 
lecture of his at the College de France, though 
the meaning of his talk has quite escaped my 
memory because I was studying the personality 
of the man." Here is the confession of the 
phrase-maker : it is not necessary to understand 
a scientist, one needs merely study his person- 
ality. "The Playboy of Western Philosophy" 
is a clever title, but not a true one. So with 
"A Philosophy for Philistines," by which Mr. 
Huneker means pragmatism. Alliteration, that 
trustworthy servitor to phrase-makers, has here 
betrayed him ; for it is evident from a reading 
of the paper that the writer does not credit the 
phrase. 

But in a deeper sense this "Playboy" is a 
boomerang. His treatment of Bergson pro- 
claims Mr. Huneker loudly as the Playboy of 
Western Critics. Having ramped genially over 
the pastures of art, music, and painting (in- 
cluding that thing called Impressionism), and 
letters, he leaps boisterously into the field of 
philosophy without troubling about the gate of 
science. Bergson's "Creative Evolution" is 
nothing much to him except an incentive to 
study the personality of the philosopher, 
which is human but not critical. This "per- 
sonal " element in recent criticism is much run 
to seed. 

It is the same with his comment on art and 
letters, though here the chattiness and charm 
lead one to forgive. There is in the volume a 
very complete and illuminating catalogue of 
Mr. Huneker's likes, which as autobiography is 
delightful. For instance : Apropos of Bergson's 
"Le Hire," "I prefer George Meredith's less 
metaphysical but more illuminative essay on 
Comedy." (Of course! But Meredith is not 



metaphysical, and Mr. Huneker is now doing 
metaphysics.) Again : " Said the wise Goethe 
the wisest man since Montaigne "; "Im- 
perial-minded Goethe reserved for philosophy 
but a small province in his vast intellec- 
tual kingdom." Compare the foregoing with 
this : " .Ernest Newman has knocked Wagner's 
philosophical pretensions to smithereens, as 
did Dmitri Merejkowski the hollow sham of 
Tolstoi's prophetic and religious vaporings." 
Now it is all very interesting to know that Mr. 
Huneker thinks Montaigne a wiser man than 
Kant or Carlyle or Lincoln or Emerson ; also 
that Tolstoi is a sham ; also that Baudelaire is a 
stupendous poet, since he added new material to 
poetry ; also that Nietzsche and Villiers de 1'Isle 
Adam are favorites; also that he is willing to 
line up with Mr. Harry Thurston Peck in the 
dictum that " George Moore is the greatest lit- 
erary artist who has struck the chords of English 
since the death of Thackeray." One calls to 
mind the great Bentley's remark to Pope, 
"Very good, Mr. Pope, but not Homer." 
Very good, Mr. Huneker, but not criticism. 
In these evaluations there is almost as much 
serious judgment as in Mr. Bernard Shaw's 
remark that no writer since Homer, not even 
Sir Walter Scott, filled him with such intel- 
lectual contempt as Shakespeare. 

In "Matisse, Picasso, and Others" there is 
some real criticism which should be helpful to 
any who confess a curiosity in regard to that 
trio of phenomena, Cubism, Futurism, and 
Impressionism. Here the writer is at home; if 
one were inclined to be hypercritical, it might 
be said he is a trifle too much at home, he is 
utterly neglige. What, for instance does this 
mean? "It is not alone the elliptical route 
pursued by Matisse in his desire to escape the 
obvious and suppress the inutile, but the crea- 
tive force of his sinuous emotional line. It is 
a richly fed line, bounding but not wiry, as is 
Blake's." Here are perfectly good English 
words dripping from the pen of an artist and 
splashing over the ordinary lines of denotation. 
Such writing grows out of a doubtful conception 
of the purpose and value of the literary art. 
The art of writing does not exist mainly for the 
purpose of representing the other arts. It is 
itself the highest ; and compelled to furnish copy 
of other copies it becomes degraded. Ruskin's 
"finest writing" was in his early so-called word- 
painting, of which we remember he grew 
ashamed later; his finest writing, however, is 
in "Sesame and Lilies," "Fors Clavigera," and 
elsewhere, as he developed the deeper art of 



82 



THE DIAL

letters. So Mr. Huneker's best writing is not 
in the technical papers, but in the first story, 
"The Magic Lantern"; in "The Artist and his 
Wife," where he gossipfully proves both sides of 
his proposition ; and in " Browsing among My 
Books," where he regales us with a discursive 
intellectual banquet. 

A further word should be added about style. 
Caesar's wife should be above reproach, and a 
critic must not despise the amenities of English 
usage and forms. Yet Mr. Huneker adopts 
that barbaric vulgarism charged to Mr. Jack 
London, "humans." In "The Later George 
Moore" we read: "An ardent Wagnerite, he 
has written by all odds and in any language, the 
best novel of musical people, 'Evelyn Innes.'" 
The order of the qualifying phrases in the above 
may be extant in some exotic language, but it 
is not English, not even Aryan. 

But when all is said, Mr. Huneker is a 
great phrase-maker. His images are wonder- 
fully felicitous, and for the most part fetching. 
He calls Bergson a "Yes-sayer," a term that 
sticks, like Mr. H. G. Wells's "Godsaker." 
Professor James, he says, wrote a " large, lucid, 
friendly book," and for this one comprehen- 
sive, satisfying phrase, hearty thanks! There 
are many such, for this is really a "book of a 
thousand and one moments." As a " playboy," 
Mr. Huneker need not be ashamed to travel 
with Synge's Irishman and his own Bergson.

THE BORGIA HORRORS AGAIN.* 



The chief title to fame of Pope Alexander VI. 
lay in the fact that he was the wickedest of all 
the popes. If his son Caesar deserves the noto- 
riety accorded him in his turn, it is because he 
was much wickeder even than his father. As 
to his sister Lucrezia, whose name is probably 
better known to the general reader than that 
of either of the others, we are compelled reluc- 
tantly to confess that she seems to have been 
much less wicked and much less able than 
either of the male relatives we have mentioned. 
All that really needed to be said about this 
fascinating family of monsters was said some 
years ago. But the subject will never cease to 
be an attractive one, as repulsive subjects so 
frequently are; and each of the two studies

which have recently appeared will be likely to 
find numerous readers. Since the trustworthy 
sources are limited in number and material, the 
two books tell the same story, even in many 
cases to the choice of the same trifling details. 
The most significant difference is that Mr. Fy vie 
narrates the story vividly and clearly, while 
Mr. Garner's account is ill digested, lacking in 
relief, and burdened with wearisome details and 
numerous unnecessary cynicisms at the expense 
of modern social conditions. 

The Father of Evil himself is not so black as 
some have painted him ; and Pope Alexander, 
who was very generally supposed to have been in 
alliance with that able but unsctupulous poten- 
tate, and to have sold him his soul for certain 
pecuniary considerations, had some very excel- 
lent traits, chief of which was his tender and 
devoted love for his children. This was perhaps 
even his strongest characteristic, avarice coming 
only second; but like many another virtue, it 
became the undoing of millions, because it left 
free reign to the devouring ambition of his son 
Caesar, a man who would murder his nearest 
and dearest, and disregard the most sacred ob- 
ligation, if he saw the slightest advantage be- 
yond. But the Borgias were not all Caesars, or 
even Alexanders. Mr. Fyvie dwells delightedly 
on the pleasant second half of Lucrezia's life, 
the years spent as a faithful wife and loving 
mother in Ferrara. There is no doubt that her 
early youth was almost as free from scruples as 
to the value of human life or female virtue as 
that of her mother or her father's indescribable 
mistress Giula Farnese, whose face (and what 
more poignantly horrible picture of the state of 
society in fifteenth century Rome could be found 
than this?) is said to be copied in the face of 
the Virgin, by Pinturicchio, which appears over 
the door of one of the rooms in the Vatican. 
But when, after having lost two husbands, one 
by divorce and the other at the hands of her 
brother, she was married to Alfonso d'Este, 
who at the death of his father became Duke of 
Ferrara, a change took place at once remark- 
able and edifying, even if it was not so absolute 
as some historians who love paradox have main- 
tained. Certainly the most interesting, and 
probably the most valuable, part of Mr. Fyvie's 
book is the pages dealing with manners and cus- 
toms in the Duchy of Ferrara under the excellent 
Ercole and his son and successor Alfonso. 

The story is full of vivid contrasts. Caesar 
married a Princess of Navarre for purely poli- 
tical reasons, left her in a few weeks to return 
to Italy, and never, as far as we are able to

learn, either saw her again or exchanged a line 
of writing with her. But his daughter by this 
marriage, whom he thus never set eyes on, 
married that paragon of gallantry, virtue, and 
generosity, the French Chevalier Bayard. Lu- 
crezia, the tenderest of mothers in Ferrara, left 
in Rome a three-year-old son by her murdered 
second husband, and never bothered her charm- 
ing head about him again. And most striking 
of all, perhaps, is the fact that the unspeakable 
Alexander's great-grandson, St. Francisco de 
Borja, who was born only seven years after the 
death of his great-grandfather, was not only a 
man of blameless character, but the most rigor- 
ous ascetic and most clairvoyant mystic of his 
generation. As a member of the Society of 
Jesus, he showed such self-forgetful zeal that 
even Ignatius Loyola was obliged to restrain 
his suicidal devotion, and there is little or no 
exaggeration in the phrase that characterizes 
him as "the most illustrious of all conquerors 
of the appetites and passions of our common 
nature." 

There is no denying the surpassing ability of 
both Pope Alexander and his terrible son. The 
year in which Columbus found San Salvador 
was also a memorable year in the history of the 
Papacy, for the day when the Spanish cardi- 
nal Rodrigo Borja set the Papal crown on Alex- 
ander's head marked the beginning of a new 
era in the Papal advance toward secular power. 
With a succession of Popes like Alexander VI., 
the fiction of Papal supremacy over mere tem- 
poral rulers might have become a reality. And 
Caesar, as general of the Papal forces, though 
he never won a real battle and was perhaps not 
a great general in the narrow sense of the word, 
was the most incredibly skilful of strategists. 
His Machiavellian artifices made Machiavelli 
himself gasp with admiration. While father 
and son worked together, the world in arms was 
no match for them ; and it required the hand of 
a mysterious malady probably the plague and 
possibly poison, which carried off the Pope in 
1503, to check their course. 

Both books are well indexed, and Mr. Gar- 
ner's has a valuable bibliography.

THE ENGLISH EPIC.* 



At no time in the history of poetry, compared 
with to-day, could we meditate on the nature and 
future of the epic with more healthy bewilderment 
and sound profit. We have been told by men as far 
apart as Brunetiere, the seasoned foe of realism, and 
Frank Norris, the young American realist, that the 
epic has modulated into the novel. Yet Mr. Alfred 
Noyes, with his dangerous but many-colored facility, 
seems almost to improvise his " Drake : An English 
Epic " in little more than a year, and publishes it 
serially in a magazine before arriving at the age at 
which Longfellow uttered his noble self-doubt in 
" Mezzo Cammin." We have been told by Poe and 
Jby countless followers, with variations of various 
degrees of absurdity, that a perfect long poem is an 
impossibility to both its creators, the singer and the 
reader. Yet the long poem, just now, is beginning 
to attract not only the buoyant younger singers but 
the most wary and cunning craftsmen. We are 
told by Benedetto Croce and his disciple Professor 
Spingarn that the classification of poems into epics 
and other genres is futile. Yet under the guardian- 
ship of Professor William Allan Neilson and Mr. 
Oliphant Smeaton are appearing two admirable 
groups of books on literary types luminous as much 
from their method as from their mature and learned 
authors. And among the very best of these books 
I do not hesitate to place Professor Dixon's "En- 
glish Epic and Heroic Poetry." 

Before we consider the English epic through an 
examination of Professor Dixon's volume, let us 
have a word with the iconoclasts. To those who 
believe that the novel has supplanted the epic let us 
recommend a rereading of the " Idylls of the King " 
more discriminating and more richly appreciative 
than has ever been accorded the poem either by its 
most ardent admirers at the zenith of Tennyson's 
acceptance or by its modish foes in this period of 
temporary reaction ; let us recommend a careful re- 
consideration of the long silences between the spa- 
cious epic ages of the past ; and let us recommend 
at least an open-minded curiosity towards the later- 
day renaissance of the long narrative poem from the 
dreaming epic episodes of the young Celts to the 
bluff realism of Mr. John Masefield. To those who 
are satisfied with the neurotic theory of the short 
poem let us recommend a careful reconsideration of 
Matthew Arnold's " On Translating Homer," espe- 
cially his words on the sustained nobility of Homer. 

With those who deny the reality of the genre 
we can scarcely permit ourselves such impertinent 
brevity. Let us state their case, as fairly as we 
may, with a concise and sweeping paragraph from 
Professor Spingarn's "The New Criticism." 

" We have done with the genres, or literary kinds. Their 
history is inseparably bound up with that of the classical 
rules. Certain works of literature have a general resem-

blance and are loosely classed together (for the sake of con- 
venience) as lyric, comedy, tragedy, epic, pastoral, and the 
like ; the classicists made of each of these divisions a fixed 
norm governed by inviolable laws. The separation of the 
genres was a consequence of this law of classicism : comedy 
should not be mingled with tragedy, nor epic with lyric. 
But no sooner was the law enunciated than it was broken 
by an artist impatient or ignorant of its restraints, and the 
critics have been obliged to explain away these violations 
of their laws, or gradually to change the laws themselves. 
But if art is organic expression, and every work of art is to 
be interrogated with the question, ' What has it expressed, 
and how completely ? ' there is no place for the question 
whether it has conformed to some convenient classification 
of critics or to some law derived from this classification. 
The lyric, the pastoral, the epic, are abstractions without 
concrete reality in the world of art. Poets do not write 
epics, pastorals, lyrics; they express themselves, and this 
expression is their only form. There are not, therefore^ 
only three, or ten, or a hundred literary kinds ; there are as 
many kinds as there are individual poets. But it is in the 
field of literary history that this error is most obvious. 
Shakspere wrote ' King Lear,' ' Venus and Adonis,' and a 
sequence of sonnets. What becomes of Shakspere, the 
creative artist, when these three works are separated from 
one another by the historian of poetry ; when they lose their 
connection with his single creative soul, and are classified 
with other works with which they have only a loose and 
vague relation ? To slice up the history of English Liter- 
ature into compartments marked comedy, tragedy, lyric, and 
the like, is to be guilty of a complete misunderstanding of the 
meaning of Criticism ; and literary history becomes a logical 
absurdity when its data are not organically related but cut 
up into sections, and placed in such compartments as these/' 

To many this argument will reveal itself porous 
with fallacies. Yet it aims at a mortal centre, and it 
has a plausible ring. We may, however, note imme- 
diately the injustice of the phrase "to slice up the 
history of English Literature into compartments" 
when we realize that the relation of one writer's 
works with another's is often marked by a contin- 
uity at least almost as close as the relation between 
two works of the same author. The relation be- 
tween Malory's "Morte Darthur" and Tennyson's 
" Idylls of the King " is surely as " organic " as the 
relation of the "Idylls of the King" and "Maud"; 
the glittering currents of Ariosto's "Orlando Fu- 
rioso " flow far more unbrokenly than the youthful 
play of modesty and pride of "The Shepheards 
Calender" and the affected sombreness of "The 
Complaints" in Spenser's "Fae"rie Queene," and 
flow with a fuller swell. The line of causation 
from " King Lear " to Geoffrey of Monmouth is 
as inexorable as the line that leads us back to 
"Venus and Adonis." We may believe all this 
without being as impatient of the individual as 
Taine, or as cocksure about the annihilation of 
the individual at death as a scientist. Moreover 
the classification into genres does not necessitate a 
neglect of an author's other works ; on the contrary 
the writer of a book on the short-story would prob- 
ably find himself forced to touch upon Hawthorne'* 
"Scarlet Letter" and Poe's poems, and, of a cer- 
tainty, De Maupassant's " Pierre et Jean " with its 
critical preface. To say that there are as many 
forms as poets is to dazzle us with a valuable but 
dangerous half-truth, which may lead straight into 
that romantic anarchy which Professor Babbitt has 



so well diagnosed in his "New LaokoOn." "Poets do 
not write epics," says Professor Spingarn, "they 
express themselves." Truly a good epigram to 
warn a Ronsard as he approaches his Franciade; 
good counsel for a George Seude'ry, a Blackmore, 
a Joel Barlow ! But is it quite enough to say that 
Virgil and the feudal rhapsodist of the Chanson, 
iron, brave, pious, and Milton with his immense and 
lifelong purposes sought merely to express them- 
selves? The laws of the neo-classical critics were 
inadequate for the romantic poets. So is the Mosaic 
law for a twentieth century captain of industry. 
Is law then a ridiculous impossibility? Doubtless 
we must always have our literary dualism, our 
Ormuzd and Ahriman, classicism and romanticism, 
eternally warring "lest one good custom should 
corrupt the world." But laws may be at once 
flexible and mighty; and the epic, a vast struc- 
ture, like De Quincey's cathedral leagues long, 
though we cannot always outline its immensity, is no 
phantom. 

Professor Dixon, in his first chapter, takes issue 
perforce with the literary anarchists. He quotes 
Croce's onslaught on "the theory of literary and 
artistic classes" and, while considering him "in the 
main, no doubt right," deems it "convenient to 
place together for purposes of comparison the Iliad 
and Beowulf, Virgil and Milton, to discuss under 
the same title poems which resemble each other, 
have points in common, follow the same models, 
aim at giving the same kind of pleasure." "Such 
a method," he insists, "has its uses and cannot be 
abandoned." It is interesting to place cheek by 
jowl Professor Spingarn's notions of the significance 
of art as expression and Professor Dixon's. " If art 
is organic expression," avers the disciple of Croce, 
"and every work of art is to be interrogated with 
the question, 'What has it expressed, and how com- 
pletely ? ' there is no place for the question whether 
it has conformed to some convenient classification 
of critics or to some law derived from this classifi- 
cation." One can but vote this word "expression," 
which Professor Spingarn uses with such finality, 
a very slippery term when he reads in Professor 
Dixon's book that "the offer made by the artist is 
simply the offer of expression; he professes form, 
and by form he must be judged." Professor Dixon 
compromises a little, calling the criticism of the 
genres scientific, as opposed to aesthetic criticism to 
which he would give other values. I would protest 
against this as a misleading classification and retort 
that the term aesthetic may well be given to the 
criticism which considers any aspect of what Pater 
happily called "mind in style." But this is not so 
disappointing as the rather hesitant attitude that 
shadows Professor Dixon's learned and shrewd ac- 
count of "The Idea of Epic" as revealed in scores 
of poets and critics. It is too bad that Professor 
Dixon does not assume magisterial robes and define 
the epic roundly. One thinks of Arnold's memor- 
able definition of the Grand Style. Doubtless Pro- 
fessor Dixon has the academician's fear of an early

shipwreck. To be sure, literary history is strewn 
with the flotsam and jetsam of definitions; but we 
should be kindled by the names that have been 
illumined with nothing more than the bright frag- 
ments of definitions. We should remember Buffon 
on style. To the creative critic there is no challenge 
more alluring than the challenge of definition. We 
can but suggest in passing that Professor Dixon's 
structure begins to totter in his discussion of the epic 
of growth and the epic of culture or art, a classifi- 
cation made memorable by Theodore Watts-Dunton 
in his great essay on poetry, but a classification 
that leads to sure confusion. Professor Dixon is 
unusually wary in his treatment of it, but the critic 
who will give us the great definition of epic in our 
time will recognize it as a Charybdis that no one 
can gaze into, however guardedly, without growing 
dizzy. He will approach Charybdis with deep-sea 
mines and will blast it. One could analyze Professor 
Dixon's reflections here, and quibble with page after 
page as he is whirled about in Charybdis; but one 
should add that few have managed the matter with 
more caution and discernment. He sees his way out 
of it when he writes that "Homer, to whom Virgil 
was confessedly a debtor, owed, who can say how 
much, to previous bards, nor was the process by 
which the poet of culture moulded his work wholly 
and absolutely dissimilar from that which Homer, 
the last of his line, himself employed." He goes so 
far as to assert that "To draw between authentic 
and literary epic a final distinction, if possible, is not 
desirable." But he sinks back with a justification 
of the old classification which, though ingenious and 
unhackneyed, is certainly not final. Then there is 
Scylla to be reckoned with the old turmoil about 
epic and romance. Here again, Professor Dixon, 
on the plea that "it may please us to distinguish, to 
untwist and unlay the composing strands, but no one 
can indicate the moment at which poetry ceases to 
be heroic because it is too romantic," shows how 
well he has learned caution from the romantic dis- 
ruption of Augustan dogma but (may the reviewer 
repeat it without appearing to urge Hector to the 
fight only to disappear like the false god in the guise 
of Deiphobus?) it is high time for the critic, with 
his new and spacious perspective, to lay down the 
law boldly in this matter. Nor would I concede that 
my sterner method would lead to a position half as 
stifling as that to which Professor Dixon, for all his 
flexibility, finds himself led when he maintains that 
"restriction rather than inspiration belongs to the 
nature of criticism, to warn rather than prescribe," 
a concession that critics as far apart as Boileau 
and Lessing and Coleridge would certainly have 
united in questioning and a concession that many 
a richly endowed "artist" would gratefully honor 
them by spurning. We must pause frequently to 
reiterate our admiration for Professor Dixon's care- 
ful attempt to legislate without allowing his keel to 
grate in the shallows of pedantry. 



" The rules, like that for the exclusion of the marvellous 
or fantastic element, laid down by the critics, would have 
excluded from the role of epic poets, if rigidly applied, 
names the most brilliant, had they not indeed made of it a 
total blank. Yet impatience, however justified, of the ab- 
surd demands and manifest contradictions of the law-givers 
has its danger if it hurry one into a contempt for all rules 
of art. Like Nature, art too has its laws; the difficulty is 
to ascertain them. They are not written large upon its sur- 
face, nor are Nature's, yet we may perhaps believe them in 
part discoverable, even if subtle and withdrawn." 

But Professor Dixon's new laws, if laws they 
may be called, are hinted with an avowed diffidence 
that will disappoint many who are now starving for 
critics who will seek those laws with something not 
only of the scientist's patient and cautious experi- 
mentation and collection of data but something of 
his noble arrogance. Let us take an example of Pro- 
fessor Dixon's unbalanced caution. He would give 
up " principles which lead to exclusion " but " seek 
principles of inclusion" (a timid judicial attitude 
the dangers of which we need not dwell upon in 
passing); and he urges even these principles of 
inclusion with noticeable hesitancy of phrase. And 
after outlining such laws, for all his rich learning 
and his sane individual thinking of the first-rate 
academician, we are not surprised to find them 
summed up rather palely in a kind of definition full 
of that uncertainty which the foes of the humanist 
are constantly over-urging against him. 

But little uncertainty dims the author's catholic 
appreciation of his vast materials. To one who has 
seen our American academicians make "Beowulf" 
a curious and stupid gargoyle for the sophomore 
student of the history of English literature, to one 
who has heard a majority of teachers admit com- 
placently that Spenser bored them, and who has felt 
in many scholastic publications that the masterpieces 
were simply tolerated as the material for a "discov- 
ery," it is most refreshing to breathe the spirit of 
this English scholar who can relish both Spenser and 
Scott, who writes of all periods with a verve that 
stimulates even when the comment is established 
truth, and who, without the aid of "discovery" or 
paradox, can write for the most part with sound 
individuality. Professor Dixon's style is at times 
rather heavy. On the other hand he can marshal 
the vexed and intricate problems of the ballad with 
an admirable breadth ; and when he grows eloquent 
over such a poem as "Beowulf," which, thank 
Heaven, he is not afraid to call incomparable, he 
writes with vigor and glow of phrase. A discerning 
sympathy is indeed almost omnipresent. To be sure 
there are some who, remembering in the Anglo- 
Saxon "Judith" the wild banquet-scene, the nobility 
and strange devout ferocity in the portrait of the 
heroine, the clash of the last battle, will be loath 
to admit the poem "tamer in spirit" than the Old 
English "Genesis" or even the "Exodus." But 
seldom will the lover of English literature find nig- 
gardly appreciation. It is easy, for instance, after 
Arnold has led the way, to make a shrewd cut at the

Puritan. It is not easy to write of the comrades of 
Milton in terms as sure and eloquent as these: 

" Clearly the Puritan suffered from disabilities, but as 
clearly he gained heights of seriousness. Baxter dates one 
of his epistles, ' London at the door of Eternity.' Such a 
mood, even if it be disinclined to dip its pencil in the hues 
of the rainbow, often rivals in imaginative passion the in- 
spiration derived by secular poets from love or patriotism or 
heroic enterprise." 

It is but inevitable that the reader should occa- 
sionally question a detached generalization or a 
comment. To one who is not so skeptical, in the 
midst of the scattered reaction against the study of 
race-traits as to deny Arnold's attribution to the 
Norman of "the love of strenuousness, clearness, 
and rapidity, the high Latin spirit," and Taine's 
exuberance over Norman polish, Norman wariness, 
Norman flexibility, the rose-window, simple, yet 
like the flower itself, the clusters of columns fusing 
solidity and grace, in fine, the facile mind, copious, 
inquisitive, chivalrous, to such a one it seems a 
dubious comment to dwell upon that period of con- 
fusion which marked the first meetings of such a 
spirit with the noble but monotonous Saxon grandeur 
as " degradation " when the discords were so soon 
to be resolved into such mellow concords. We 
wonder why this book should tell us of Mannyng's 
"Handlynge Synne" and nothing of his quaint, 
garrulous adaptation of Langtoft's chronicle. In 
asserting that the episode of Sin and Death is the 
only mediaeval lapse in " Paradise Lost " where " for 
the rest ... is a world in which the laws of beauty 
and of taste prevail," Professor Dixon is hardly just 
to what may be without paradox called the ugly 
magnificence of the famous allegory, and he seems 
to forget such cruder imaginings as the periodical 
transformation of the devils into serpents devouring 
apples of ashes as well as many details in the great 
battle-scene, in the description of Eden in its blessed- 
ness, and in the eloquent but interminable preaching 
of Raphael. Professor Dixon considers the method 
of the chronicle plays the " reverse of epic," and 
quotes with too much sweep Pater's generalization 
that " Shakespeare's kings are not, nor are meant 
to be, great men," whereas he should have found 
one of his richest climaxes in an elaborate discussion 
of the great trilogy on Henry IV. and Henry V., of 
which the last play is less of a drama than a mirac- 
ulously sustained epic ode aglow with the exaltation 
of the hero from a variation of the " male Cinder- 
ella " type (so dear to English democracy in Beowulf, 
Havelok, Gareth, and a hundred others), to the most 
majestic and kindly and English of England's kings. 
Perhaps it is a special and a warped interest that 
makes me question the proportions of a discussion 
of seventeenth century heroic poetry which chooses 
the " Davideis," " Gondibert," and " Pharonnida " 
as the types, and does not even mention the far 
greater religious epics of the Fletchers. But even 
if this is voted a crotchet of mine, I can at least add 
that it is perhaps this omission that betrays Professor 
Dixon into a glaring error when he acclaims " Para- 



dise Regained " as " the first attempt, outside of 
Scripture narrative, to draw the portrait of the 
Founder of Christianity. 

I have gone beyond all bounds in my janglings 
with a book to which I owe a profound gratitude. 
The epic of mediaeval and modern literature has 
generally daunted the scholarly critic, as it has 
tempted the belletristic trifler to indulge in general- 
izations which make a lover of epic inarticulate with 
rage. Since Professor Ker's " Epic and Romance " 
I know of no study of this kind as good as Pro- 
fessor Dixon's "English Epic and Heroic Poetry." 
Dare I add now, in this very moment of contrition 
over my brawlings, that I am consumed with a de- 
sire, which space forbids, to break lances with Pro- 
fessor Dixon over Spenser and Tennyson ? Professor 
Dixon has, to a certain extent, broken away from 
the epicure distaste for Spenser's allegory, that for 
most romantic readers began with Hurd and culmi- 
nated in Lowell's brilliant Luciferian utterances. 
But Professor Dixon is, from my special angle, too 
sympathetic still with those who, like Leigh Hunt 
and Lowell, hold "The Faerie Queene" to be a 
mere gallery of pictures for the luxurious dilettante ; 
and he is too hesitant in accepting the results of 
much recent work on Spenser's allegory which, when 
treated synthetically, will give Spenser credit for a 
high seriousness at present more than half denied 
him by most critics except that rare spirit just 
departed, Edward Dowden. And I can but regret 
that Professor Dixon has keyed his account of 
Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" to FitzGerald's 
whims, which have inoculated us in this age of tem- 
porary depreciation of Tennyson. I should rejoice 
in writing here an elaborate apologia for Tennyson 
that would heighten Professor Dixon's own judicious 
praise, and would go as far as to hold a brief for 
the " Idylls of the King " as the epic of nineteenth 
century England. Yet since this is material for a 
book and not for a review, I cannot do better than 
quote these words of Mr. Chesterton's: 

" If a critic has, as he ought to have, any of the functions 
anciently attributed to a prophet, it ought not to be difficult 
for him to prophesy that Tennyson will pass through a 
period of facile condemnation and neglect before we arrive 
at a true appreciation of his work." 

And since I know that many (especially those with 
whom it has become a fashion to retail Mr. Frederic 
Harrison's now conventional jeer against Tenny- 
eon's Arthur as a conventional country curate of 
Victorian England) will raise their eyebrows at my 
last assertions, I will cover my retreat with two more 
suggestive quotations from Mr. Chesterton. 

" That Tennyson felt that lyrical enthusiasm could be de- 
voted to established customs, to indefensible and ineradic- 
able national constitutions, to the dignity of time and the 
empire of unutterable common sense, all this did not make 
him a tamer poet but an infinitely more original one. Any 
poetaster can describe a thunderstorm ; it requires a poet to 
describe the ancient and quiet sky." 

" A man who expresses in poetry new and strange and un- 
discovered emotions is not a poet ; he is a brain specialist."

The constitution \ n " An Economic Interpretation of 
economically the Constitution of the United States 
interpreted. (Macmillan) Professor Charles A. 
Beard makes the point that, as in natural science 
no organism is pretended to be understood so long 
as its merely superficial aspects are described, so in 
history no movement by a mass of people can be 
comprehended until that mass is resolved into its 
component parts. He shows that during the period 
of the Federation commercial conditions in the 
States were becoming progressively worse. The 
interest on governmental paper was unpaid, and the 
value of such documents was reduced to a minimum. 
There was a tendency to repudiate public debt, and 
to issue depreciated paper money as legal tender. 
The call for a revision of the Articles came chiefly 
from the commercial centres ; and the agitation was 
largely kept up by the creditor class, who realized 
the insecurity of their interests under the existing 
conditions. A large proportion of the members of 
the Constitutional Convention were holders of such 
paper as would be increased in value by the pro- 
posed organization. He examines minutely into the 
individual holdings of the members, by means of 
the records in the Treasury Department and similar 
documentary evidence, showing who favored and 
who opposed the various proposals. He reviews 
the campaign for the adoption of the Constitution, 
and shows that the well organized commercial 
classes were leaders throughout in favor of the 
document. On the other hand the opposition came 
chiefly from the farmer and debtor classes. In the 
popular vote for delegates to the State ratification 
conventions, only about one-third of the adult males 
voted, and the Constitution was ratified by a vote 
of probably not more than one-sixth of the adult 
males. It was not ratified by the whole people, 
nor by the States, but by the consolidated group of 
interests who knew no state boundaries. Under such 
circumstances it was natural that the Constitution 
should be essentially a commercial document. Un- 
fortunately, in regard to some of his points, the 
author seems more like the holder of a brief than 
an impartial seeker for truth. He tells us that 
in the Connecticut ratification convention, out of 
one hundred and twenty-eight men who voted for 
ratification sixty-five were holders of public securi- 
ties, their names being given; but he does not tell 
what proportion of the opponents held such papers. 
In the Pennsylvania convention we note that eigh- 
teen out of the forty-seven who voted for ratification 
were men of education; while only two of their 
twenty-three opponents are thus characterized, and 
of one of these it is recorded, "In deference to his 
constituents he did not sign the ratification." Pro- 
fessor Beard does not call attention to this fact; 
but is it not possible that the supporters of the new 
Constitution, because they were men of broader 
education, therefore realized more fully the neces- 
sity for the Constitution? Many of the opposition 



were men of means also. Only among the opposi- 
tion was there objection to the prohibition relative 
to the impairment of contract. May not the framers 
of the Constitution have been more actuated by a 
desire for honesty than by sordid reasons ? We fear 
that the ultimate effect of Professor Beard's work 
may be harmful, because of its singleness of view it 
tends to give an erroneous impression and to foster 
unjustified class antagonism. 

Roval masques In her volume entitled "Court Mas- 
in the days ques of James L: Their Influence on 

of James I. Shakespeare and the Public Thea- 
tres" (Putnam), an absorbing wealth of material 
regarding the Jacobean masque is presented by Dr. 
Mary Sullivan, who has been investigating a field 
hitherto little known to students of English litera- 
ture. The chief theme of the book is thus indicated : 
"In a monarchy so personal as that of England 
under James, everything done by the monarch or 
by any of his family had a diplomatic as well as a 
social bearing, and in the case of the masque the 
diplomatic, under cover of the social, seems to have 
been of greatest significance. To know this signifi- 
cance, one must discover, with accurate historic 
detail, the diplomatic relations of the countries con- 
cerned." The first four chapters of the book are 
devoted to a somewhat over-leisurely recital of the 
way in which England's favor was accorded first to 
Spain and then to France, through the medium of 
invitations and other special honors connected with 
the royal masques. The last two chapters discuss 
the cost of dramatic productions in the court, and, 
briefly, the influence of diplomatic conditions upon 
literature. With the enthusiasm and tireless energy 
of the critical scholar, Dr. Sullivan has pursued her 
researches, and has brought together, in footnotes 
and in a copious appendix, a host of letters and 
other documents, public and private, to support her 
statements. It is this material, reprinted carefully 
in the original English or French, which will be of 
greatest interest ; for here is matter, pleasantly en- 
dited, full of references to the pomp and circum- 
stance of the presentation of masques. In flashes 
one discovers, now a hint of the rivalries and piques 
of statesmen ; now, the inordinate vanity of the noble 
performers; now, the wanton extravagance of the 
English in jewels, costumes, and scenery. These 
precise facts about King James, Queen Anne, and 
Prince Charles, and the allusions to the "Masque 
of Blackness" or to the "Masque of Queens" and 
others, give the reader a keen sense of being a wit- 
ness of the performances, and of observing in per- 
son the men and manners and masquers. Possibly 
the book is rather too sternly academic, and presup- 
poses too much knowledge of masques to make it 
attractive to the general reader; but the student of 
drama will appreciate very warmly this contribution 
to dramatic criticism. The publishers announce 
that two companion volumes by this author are in 
preparation, "Court Masques of Elizabeth" and 
"Court Masques of Charles I."

A half-forgotten The brave and modest patriot of 
hero of the whom Horace Greeley said, '' The 

Country's salvation claims no nobler 
sacrifice than that of James S. Wadsworth of New 
York," has long deserved a biography as carefully 
compiled and as handsomely published as Mr. Henry 
Greenleaf Pearson's large, illustrated octavo which 
worthily commemorates the citizen-soldier's benefi- 
cent life, under the title, " James S. Wadsworth of 
Geneseo, Brevet Major-General of United States 
Volunteers" (Scribner). The Connecticut Wads- 
worths are known to fame especially through those 
three illustrious representatives of the name, Captain 
Joseph Wadsworth, of Charter-Oak renown, General 
James Wadsworth, who distinguished himself in both 
the French and Indian War and the Revolution, 
and Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, Commissary 
General under Greene when the latter took charge 
of the quartermaster's department. Of the same 
sturdy stock as these men was James Samuel Wads- 
worth, eldest son of James, who had early left 
Connecticut to acquire lands in the Genesee valley, 
and Naomi Wolcott, cousin of Oliver Wolcott, Secre- 
tary of the Treasury in Washington's cabinet. A 
few years of study at Harvard and in the Yale Law 
School, in Daniel Webster's office and in that of 
McKean and Denniston at Albany, preceded his 
settlement at Geneseo to look after the extensive 
family estates; for though he was admitted to the 
bar in 1833, he never practised his profession. Of 
his intelligent and generous aid to sundry good 
causes, his services to his country in war-time, 
especially his gallantry in the battles of Bull Run 
(first battle), Gettysburg, and the Wilderness, 
and his death from a mortal wound received when 
trying to rally his men in the last-named engage- 
ment, Mr. Pearson writes with adequate fulness and 
from the most authoritative sources. With so little 
in the way of personal or family records to rely 
upon, the wonder is that he has pieced out so com- 
plete a biography. Portraits, maps, footnotes, ap- 
pended matter, and index are all provided in due 
form and proportion. The book is of permanent value 
and also of especial interest in this semi-centennial 
year of one of the great battles it describes.

convictions of , , , , . j r , 

spiritual during several months, induced some 

realities. very serious thinking in Sir Francis 

Younghusband, and these meditations on the deep 
things of existence are presented by him in a volume 
entitled "Within: Thoughts During Convalescence" 
(Duffield). Tossed and trampled by that twentieth- 
century monster, the automobile, the writer under- 
went far more than the agony of the average death, 
but his strong constitution and will to live brought 
him through with an incidental store of inner expe- 
rience that was well worth relating. Somewhat in 
the manner of Mr. A. C. Benson's analysis and 
description of his two years' struggle with nervous 
prostration, familiar to readers of "Thy Rod and 
Thy Staff," this victim of an almost complete physi- 



cal collapse paints his sufferings in a few strong 
and telling strokes, and then proceeds to deduce 
the moral, so far as it seems to him to be deduci- 
ble. Like Mr. Benson, he too emerges from the 
soul-trying experience with strong convictions of an 
eternal something not ourselves; or, rather, in the 
present instance this undying principle is felt to be 
an impersonal force of which we are a part, while 
with Mr. Benson it takes the form of an external 
personal deity. The force as conceived by Sir 
Francis Younghusband, however, is not blind and 
purposeless, but intelligently striving to perfect 
itself; it is, he says, "a vital, propelling impulse 
vibrating through us all, expressing itself and fulfill- 
ing its purpose through us, and uniting us together 
in one vast spiritual unity." The same thought has, 
of course, already received more elaborate expres- 
sion elsewhere, as in Professor Royce's "The World 
and the Individual," but taken in connection with 
the circumstances that led to its formulation, this 
creed of Sir Francis Younghusband's is interesting 
reading, and it has that tone of conviction which 
comes only from an unforgettable personal experi- 
ence. The writer's clear and readable style is 
marred by a few imperfections, due evidently to 
insufficient care. When he tells us that "there is a 
higher kind of courage than physical courage. We 
feel that moral courage is of a higher degree" (the 
italics are his), he seems quite needlessly to confuse 
two very different things, kind and degree. He also 
disfigures his pages with the repeated use of "will" 
for "shall," and of "would" for "should."

Sir Horace Walpole, unsurpassed though his pleasant 
pages are as a picture of the age in which he lived 
and of the notable persons with whom he was ac- 
quainted. Hence the value of Miss Alice Drayton 
Greenwood's compendious volume, " Horace Wai- 
pole's World: A Sketch of Whig Society under 
George III." (Macmillan). The book's nine chap- 
ters treat of Walpole himself, the literary activities 
of his hours of leisure, the taste of the period in 
which he lived, travel, ways and means, French 
society before the Revolution, king's ministers and 
king's friends, some of Walpole's high-born lady 
friends, and, finally, the " legend " of Charles James 
Fox, a legend of statesmanlike qualities and 
achievements which the writer refuses to take on 
trust. Walpole's friends and acquaintances, and 
such incidents and anecdotes as throw light on his 
times, are skilfully and in a scholarly manner intro- 
duced as occasion makes fitting. Curious is it to 
note Walpole's complaint of the increasing cost of 
material and labor when he was building Strawberry 
Hill a century and a half ago. " You would be 
frightened at the dearness of everything," he writes 
in 1762 ; " I build out of economy, for unless I do 
now, in two years I shall not be able to afford it." 
Miss Greenwood's praise of the literary style of the

period under discussion seems a bit excessive to 
those less enthusiastic in their admiration for graces 
of rhetoric so carefully studied. More might have 
been made of the famous friendship of the two 
Horaces, Walpole and Mann ; but of this Mr. Sieve- 
king has lately written at length. The occasional 
familiar " Horry " as a designation of Walpole 
could perhaps have been dispensed with in a book 
dealing with the dignified and formally correct 
eighteenth century. Good portraits and views adorn 
the volume, its frontispiece reproducing a hitherto 
unpublished pastel of Walpole by Rosalba, the pro- 
perty of the late Lady Dorothy Nevill. Miss Green- 
wood has packed into her two hundred and fifty 
pages a great amount and variety of instructive and 
entertaining matter. Her task was worth under- 
taking, and she has performed it well.

whose fame was at its height forty or fifty years

of two actors of the Grossmith family and name, has 
won for himself distinction as an artist, actor, theatre- 
manager, and playwright, and in his volume of rem- 
iniscences, "From Studio to Stage" (Lane), shows 
himself to be an author with an entertaining, often 
amusing style, and well furnished with the where- 
withal to make a very readable book. On his last 
page he gives as his motto, " Nothing matters," 
which of course must be taken with considerable 
deductions; but his good-humored readiness to ex- 
pose his own youthful follies, and to tell amusing 
stories at his own expense, proves at any rate that he 
is not one to over-estimate the importance of trifles. 
His account of his schoolboy escapades, his study of 
art and his successes as a portrait-painter, the run 
of hard luck that caused him to forsake the palette 
and brush for the stage, and his ups and downs in 
the precarious profession of a public entertainer, is 
all told with humorous frankness and a quite engag- 
ing interest in his own performance in the drama 
of life. In a characteristic passage he informs us: 
"My dear old friends Toole and Sir Henry Irving 
used to be greatly amused with my Music Hall imi- 
tations. I was called upon frequently to give them, 
and no one seemed to enjoy them more than the 
First gentleman in Europe, before whom I gave 
them more than once." These amateur imperson- 
ations paved the way from the studio to the stage; 
but that one who had had a number of paintings 
exhibited at the Royal Academy should look back 
with some regret at the change of calling, is not 
surprising. Several of his pictures are reproduced 
for his book, which has also the illustrations suitable 
to an actor's autobiography. The very name "Gros- 
smith " on the title-page is enough to ensure the 
readable quality of the volume's often piquantly 
personal contents.

the eighteenth lectual conditions in the eighteenth

his new volume entitled " The English Scene in the 
Eighteenth Century" (Putnam), should treat of 
only three cities as embodying the life of the time, 
and that one of these cities should be important as 
a mere social appendage of one of the others and 
the third should be significant more of the next 
century than of the eighteenth. London was the 
England of the time, Bath was its pleasure resort, 
and Liverpool was the seaport which connected it 
with the Colonies and marked the way towards the 
greatness of the Empire. Its population is consid- 
ered with almost equal simplicity. The nobility was 
socially and almost politically supreme; the middle 
class was just beginning to make itself industrially 
felt, but did not yet bulk very largely on the national 
consciousness; the tradesman was ignored. Conse- 
quently we obtain in a comprehensive glance a pretty 
intelligent view of the whole period, and, presented 
attractively as it is by Mr. Roscoe, a very pleasant 
one. We are made acquainted with the great lords 
and ladies, the Duke of Grafton, who would adjourn 
a cabinet meeting for a race meeting, and the Duchess 
of Devonshire, who made Sheridan's political career, 
at least in its beginnings, possible; we visit Bath, 
more tyrannically ruled by Beau Nash than ever 
was England by the Stuarts ; we meet the ladies 
and gentlemen who worked and played at literature ; 
and we watch the Wedgwoods rise to prominence 
through their industrial energy and inventiveness. 
It is on the whole a very enlivening picture. There 
is no attempt to go beneath the scene, to penetrate 
into the thought of the century as Leslie Stephen 
did, or to dwell upon its history as did Lecky. The 
literary judgments are appreciative and occasionally 
dilettante. When one has finished reading the book, 
one realizes that the people of the eighteenth cen- 
tury enjoyed life, and rarely let their morals inter- 
fere with their enjoyment. 

A Jesuit ^ on J uan de Austria, the gifted and 

on the hero ill-starred illegitimate son of Charles 

ofLepanto. t h e pif^ o f s pa i nj has received so 
relatively small a share of attention from Anglo- 
Saxon historians that Lady Moreton's translation of 
Padre Luis Coloma's "Story of Don John of Aus- 
tria" (Lane) provides the English-speaking public 
with a certain amount of new material. Padre 
Coloma's election to membership in the Spanish 
Academy was due largely to this book, which was 
hailed in Spain as a new departure in the use of 
the method of the romance for the sake of adding 
interest to historical writing. The novelty consists 
in the occasional resort to the expedient of suspense, 
and in frequent discussion of mental processes which 
must be for the most part gratuitous conjecture. 
The author refrains, in general, from citing author- 
ities, although the engaging progress of a really 
eloquent narrative is interfered with occasionally

THE DIAL 



[August 1 



by the insertion of one of King Philip's tedious and 
turgid epistles, or of Don John's loyal and involved 
responses. The author's position is frankly that of 
a patriotic Spanish Catholic, who can see no good 
in Moorish infidels or Dutch heretics; in casuistry, 
that of a thoroughgoing Jesuit, he qualifies the 
intrigue that resulted in the capture and assassina- 
tion of a Moorish chieftain, as " a plot which would 
have been iniquitous had it not been against such a 
scoundrel as Aben Humeya "; and of an enthusiastic 
and determined eulogist, whose work, if on the whole 
fairly trustworthy, nevertheless paints his hero a 
little brighter, and his hero's enemies a little darker, 
than do other authorities. An interesting addition 
to the copies of portraits with which the book is 
generously illustrated, is a paragraph of discussion 
of each, dealing both with the subject and with 
the original painting. The translation is somewhat 
amateurish. 

Ravenna: it, Ravenna has always played a great 
greatnett and part in the history of Europe ; of 
ittbeautv. one period the confused and half- 

barbaric centuries that lie between antiquity and the 
Middle Age it is now the only surviving monu- 
ment. Why a city so solitary, so inaccessible, so 
remote, should have had such unique importance is 
the question which Mr. Edward Hutton sets himself 
to answer in his delightful volume " Ravenna: A 
Study" (Dutton). He defines his purpose as "an 
essay in memoriam of her greatness, her beauty, 
and her forlorn hope." Beginning with Ravenna's 
first entrance into history when Julius Caesar 
chose it as his headquarters while treating with the 
Senate before crossing the Rubicon, continuing 
through the epoch of the great tragedy of the 
decline and fall of the Roman administration, the 
story is brought down through the Middle Ages, 
through the period when it was beloved of Dante 
and Boccaccio, down to our modern time, as the 
favorite of Byron, Carducci, and poetic souls gen- 
erally. Very beautiful indeed are the illustrations 
by Mr. Harald Sund, both in color and in line 
drawings. Three sketch maps add to the book's 
value, especially for the tourist. 

Few writers seem capable of self- 

re8 t raint when Ital y is their Subject. 

But M. Andre* Maurel, in the second 
volume of his "Little Cities of Italy (Putnam), 
outdoes even the customary extravagance in writing. 
Take for example such a feverish passage as this: 
" I am fascinated, lost, my limbs are weak, my heart 
empty. I am exalted and dejected, at the same time 
staggering and walking on air. I no longer know 
anything, my eyes burn, and when I shut them I see 
the hundred thousand fires of a kaleidoscope turning 
round under my eye-lids. Is it possible? Was such 
magnificence ever created? Did men ever exist 
capable of conceiving such visions and realizing 
them as fixed things?" In straightforward speech, 
this means that the author has arrived in Ravenna 



the night previous and is about to sally forth to see 
the city, his state being, to quote again, "Why wish 
to understand? It is so sweet to feel! " Naturally 
this Post-Impressionist attitude of mind in litera- 
ture results, as it does in art, in offering pictures 
with blurred outlines and colors all running into 
each other. However, the painter usually has the 
goodness to affix a tag to his canvas which furnishes 
something of a clue to the beholder. Not so Mon- 
sieur Maurel. His table of contents consists of such 
chapter- headings as "The Nettle," "The Labyrinth," 
"The Nuptial Flight," "The Muscles of Hercules," 
etc.; and it is only by dint of much searching (since 
the volume has no index) that one finds that these 
captions describe Pavia, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, 
etc. The forty illustrations from photographs by 
Henry H. Burton are uncommonly fine. 

Despite the title, Mr. Wilfred S. 
Jackson's "Cross Views" (Lane) is 
rather less paradoxical than informal 
essays usually are. Indeed, " Selfishness and Other 
Virtues" is almost the only example of the normal 
upside-down or inside-out type of essay ; and even 
in this case the author's mental agility lands him 
squarely on his feet beside the rest of us. Mr. 
Jackson's views cross to change a bad figure to a 
worse like the threads of a spider's web, seeming 
very intricate yet being very simple, particularly if 
you watch the wonder-worker while at his task. 
Personally, Mr. Jackson is a highly agreeable hu- 
man being, sober, conservative, flexible, genuinely 
humorous, just the man, in fact, with whom to 
spend "A Wet Day," whether in town or country, 
while he chats about "Woman," "Marriage and 
Divorce," "John Bull," "The Man of the World," 
and anything else that his full mind proposes to pour 
comment on. He knows his England intimately, 
and knows the Continent tolerably. His acquaint- 
ance with queer sesquipedalian verbal monsters 
would drive you to your dictionary if he did not 
hurry you past to safety with a significant wink. 
And his book is by no means innocent of Latin. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A type facsimile of the " Kilmarnock " Burns of 1786, 
supplied with editorial apparatus by Mr. M. S. Cleghorn, 
appears as one of the neat Oxford reprints of English 
classics published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

" Everyman's Library " will have to look to its laurels 
if the publishers of " Bonn's Popular Library " (Mac- 
millan) go on with their reissue of those volumes in 
shilling form. It is a most welcome enterprise, and we 
trust the demand will be such as to effect a transfor- 
mation of the entire library into this acceptable and 
inexpensive form. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson's well-known " American High- 
ways and Byways Series " (Macmillan) is now being 
republished at a lower price in editions intended to 
appeal especially to tourists. Three volumes of this 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



91 



reissue are now ready, " The Rocky Mountains," " The 
Great Lakes," and " The Mississippi Valley." A note 
embodying specific information and suggestions for the 
intending traveller is appended to each chapter. The 
fine series of pictures from Mr. Johnson's camera is 
retained in these new editions. 

To its interesting series of exact type-facsimiles of 
famous poetical first editions, the Oxford University 
Press has recently added Tennyson's Poems published 
in 1842, and Wordsworth's Poems published in 1807. 
To the sentimental book-lover there is a decided fasci- 
nation about these beautifully-produced facsimiles, while 
their value to the literary student is of course consider- 
able. Three new volumes have just been added to the 
same publisher's pocket series of "World's Classics," 
John Gait's "The Entail," George Eliot's "Romola," 
and Milton's English Poems. 

The attractive little series of Canadian booklets com- 
piled by Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee and published by the 
Musson Book Co. of Toronto, reviewed in our issue of 
January 1 last, has lately received the addition of two 
new volumes " Scouts of Empire " and " Humour of 
the North." The former is made up of six sketches 
of famous Canadian explorers. The latter is a little 
anthology of representative Canadian humor, in which 
Thomas Chandler Haliburton (" Sam Slick "), the Hab-. 
itant poet William Henry Drummond, and George 
Thomas Lanigan (of " Ahkoond of Swat " fame) occupy 
most of the space. 

A combination text-book in English has been prepared 
by Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. It is entitled "Rhetoric and 
the Study of Literature," and is published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. Planned for the upper high school 
years, it includes a brief review of rhetoric, a series of 
chapters upon the study of the chief literary forms, and 
a condensed survey of the history of English literature. 
A series of questions on typical masterpieces will be 
found useful by teachers who are working with the eight 
works selected for analysis. Helps for the teacher 
are, indeed, abundant throughout this suggestive and 
thoughtfully-prepared work. 

From his three volumes of " Wayfaring in France," 
published several years ago, Mr. Edward Harrison 
Barker has selected such passages as present " a plan 
of travel in better conformity with the sequence of ideas 
and purpose than the distribution of the same matter 
in the original works"; and this material, with some 
retouches, is now issued in a single volume (Macmillan). 
The work is a pleasantly written chronicle of journeyings 
on foot in Southwestern France, through the valley 
of the Dordogne from Auvergne to the Bay of Biscay. 
Many of the archaic looking, yet well executed, wood- 
cuts from the original edition are retained here. 

Most children in our elementary schools study the 
history of the United States without any background 
whatever. To provide them with a very elementary 
compendium of the facts without which our very modern 
history is meaningless has been the task of Mr. Wilbur 
F. Gordy in his " American Beginnings in Europe " 
(Scribner). Among these beginnings are the Eliza- 
bethan enterprise, the fall of Constantinople, the cru- 
sades, the Roman empire, the empire of Alexander, and 
the civilization of Greece. All those things have to be 
described very simply, of course, and Mr. Gordy has 
done the work in a way that must hold the interest of 
any intelligent child. The most difficult thing to do is 
to find a place for such a book as this in our stiff schemes 
of elementary teaching. 



XOTES. 



"The Flying Inn" is the title of Mr. Gilbert K. 
Chesterton's latest book, to be issued in the fall by the 
John Lane Co. 

The August " Century " contains the first instalment 
of Mr. Theodore Dreiser's travel sketches, the record 
of his impressions of Europe on his first tour after the 
age of forty. 

A reprint of the first edition of the Elizabethan play, 
"Common Conditions," dating from 1576, and now 
edited by Dr. C. F. Tucker Brooke, is announced by the 
Yale University Press. 

" Gold," the first of a series of novels by Mr. Stewart 
Edward White, containing material from the early his- 
tory of California, will be published in the autumn by 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

The Carteret Book Club of Newark, New Jersey, 
issues this month two essays, " Criticism " by Walt 
Whitman and "Charles Dickens" by Charles Dudley 
Warner, from the original manuscripts, both believed 
never to have been printed until now. 

'" Fifty Years of My Life," by Mr. Theodore Roose- 
velt, is announced for fall publication by Messrs. Mac- 
millan. Three other books of interest are: "The 
Theory of Social Revolutions," by Mr. Brooks Adams; 
" One Hundred Years of Peace," by Hon. Henry Cabot 
Lodge; and "The Soul of America," by Mr. Stanton 
Coit. 

Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. have ready for early 
publication a new volume of critical social studies by 
Professor Scott Nearing entitled "Social Sanity: a 
Preface to the Book of Social Progress," and an im- 
portant work on the " Life and Times of Louis XL," 
by Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew C. P. Haggard, brother 
of Sir Rider Haggard, the novelist. 

The Early Life of Mark Rutherford by Himself " 
will be published this month by the Oxford University 
Press. These autobiographical notes were written by 
the late Dr. W. Hale White when he was seventy-eight 
years old, not primarily for publication but " to please 
two or three persons related to me by affection." The 
volume, uniform with " Pages from a Journal" and 
" More Pages " already issued, will contain portraits of 
"Mark Rutherford" and his father, and views of old 
Bedford. 

Immediately forthcoming publications of Messrs. 
Longmans, Green & Co. are: "The Reign of Henry VII., 
from Contemporary Sources," selected and arranged, 
with Introduction, by Mr. A. F. Pollard; "The Rise of 
South Africa, a History of the Origin of South African 
Colonization and of Its Development towards the East 
from the Earliest Times to 1857," by Professor G. E. 
Cory ; and " Carducci, a Selection of His Poems," with 
versed translations, notes, and three introductory essays, 
by Mr. C. L. Bickersteth. 

The autumn announcement list of Messrs. Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. includes among other important new 
books the following: "The Letters of Charles Eliot 
Norton," with a biographical comment by Miss Sara 
Norton and Mr. M. A. DeWolfe Howe; "Letters and 
Recollections of Alexander Agassiz, with a Sketch of 
His Work and Life," by Mr. George R. Agassiz; "The 
Life of Lyman Trumbull," by Mr. Horace White; " The 
Americans in the Philippines," by Mr. James A. LeRoy, 
with Introduction by Hon. William H. Taft; and " Bull 
Run, Its Strategy and Tactics," by Mr. R. M. Johnston.

*- of salient facts and principles, and dramatic portrayal of 
the greater personages and periods. The rise of the common 
people from villeinage to a share and later control in repre- 
sentative government is traced with clearness and force. The 
growth of Parliament, the decreasing power of the nobles, 
the influence of great men, the vast social and economic 
changes, the development of the British Empire, and the 
problems of the present are adequately set forth.

A Veritable Human Document 

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
OF A WORKING WOMAN 

By ADELHEID POPP 

WITH INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN EDITION BY 
JENKIN LLOYD JONES, LINCOLN CENTER, CHICAGO 

An impressive account of the struggles of a woman 
who undertakes to earn her own livelihood. Will 
be read with interest by all who are concerned with 
the great problem of the woman toiler. 
Dr. Jones says in his introduction. 

Here is the story of a ' 'working woman ' ' 
who has felt the bitterness of hard, unrelenting 
toil, and out of the agony of such a life has 
been brought into sympathy with the Gospel 
side of co-operation. By bitter tears the eyes 
were cleared to read the illuminating message 
of the great democratic movement that assumes 
the name "socialism" in many quarters. 

That working men and women will read this 
book with bated breath and tearful sympathy 
goes without the saying. But it is a book for 
the employer more than for the employee, for 
the more favored rather than the less favored. 
It is a book that ought to find a place among the 
religious books on the center-table of the rich.

THE MIDDLE-CLASS MIND. 



Mr. Sydney Brooks, who is one of the most 
fair-minded and intelligent students of Amer- 
ican society and politics, makes the following 
pertinent observations upon the intellectual life 
of this country : 

"While the sum total of American intelligence is un- 
doubtedly impressive, it is more by reason of its quantity 
than its quality. I mean that the educational system of 
the country has rather raised a great and unprecedented 
number of people to the standard of what we in England 
should call middle-class opinion than raised the standard 
itself, and that as a consequence the operative force of 
American politics is middle-class opinion left pretty 
much to its own devices and not corrected by the best 
intelligence of the country. And middle-class opinion, 
especially when left to its own devices, is a fearsome 
thing. It marks out the nation over which it has gained 
control as a willing slave of words, a willing follower 
of the fatal short-cut, a prey to caprice, unreasoning 
sentiment and the attraction of ' panaceas,' and stamps 
broadly upon its face the hall-mark of an honestly uncon- 
scious parochialism. Such, to be quite candid, appears 
to me to have been too much its effect in America. I 
know of no country where a prejudice lives so long, 
where thought is at once so active and so shallow and 
a praiseworthy curiosity so little guided by fixed stand- 
ards, where a craze finds readier acceptance, where 
policies that are opposed to all human experience or con- 
tradicted by the most elementary facts of social or eco- 
nomic conditions stand a better chance of captivating the 
populace, or where men who are fundamentally insignif- 
icant attain to such quaintly authoritative prestige." 

It is a character-study of Mr. Bryan that leads 
Mr. Brooks to make these striking generaliza- 
tions. It was, we believe, observation of Brit- 
ish middle-class opinion concerning the war 
between Russia and Turkey that led Matthew 
Arnold, in 1877, to deliver himself of the fol- 
lowing comment: 

" That wonderful creature, the British philistine, has 
been splashing about during the war in a way more 
than worthy of himself. That is what is peculiar to 
England and what misleads foreigners; there is no 
country in the world where so much nonsense becomes 
so public, and so appears to stand for the general voice 
of the nation, determining its government." 

Viewed in the light of this reciprocal criticism, 
honors would seem to be easy as regards the 
two countries concerned, since the philistine 
mind and the middle-class mind may be taken 
as mutually convertible terms. 

With all its intellectual shortcomings, and its 
deplorable lack of idealism, this type of mind 



100 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



is one of the most substantial assets of any 
nation, and it is only when it plants itself as an 
obstacle in the path of progress, or when it 
blindly turns from the light that shines for the 
vision " purged with euphrasy and rue " that it 
becomes an object of derision. Nor is it without 
its specific virtues and its peculiar, if narrow, 
idealism. It makes for stability in the social 
order, and it sets bounds which are on the whole 
salutary to the unlicensed strivings of the intel- 
lectual order. It has an eye for the practical 
and the concrete, and looks askance at whatever 
is abstract or speculative. The mechanism of 
society needs a " governor " to save it from being 
torn to pieces by its internal energies, and this 
controlling influence is supplied by the middle- 
class mind. Philosophical historians assure us 
that the middle-class element preserves societies 
from disintegration, perpetuating the institu- 
tions which are its bone and sinew. It saved 
through the middle ages what was best worth 
saving from the wreck of the Roman Empire ; 
the weakening of its power was responsible for 
such tragic catastrophes as the partition of 
Poland and the French Revolution. It organ- 
ized the Reformation and evolved the Hanseatic 
League. Its sturdy resistance to oppression 
overthrew the Stuart despotism and achieved 
the Italian Risorgimento. It saved the Amer- 
ican Union in the dark years of the sixties. It 
is to-day stoutly opposing imperialistic oppres- 
sion in Finland, aristocratic predominance in the 
Scandinavian countries, and military heroics in 
the German Empire. It expresses the solid cen- 
tral mass of the people in nearly every modern 
nation ; its individual units are neither of the 
servile caste nor of the highly-placed, but of the 
sober and self-respecting class which pays the 
bills of society and keeps its course in safe chan- 
nels. " Its steady-going habit," says Matthew 
Arnold, " leads at last, as I have said, up to 
science, up to the comprehension and interpre- 
tation of the world. . . . Doors that open, 
windows that shut, locks that turn, razors that 
shave, coats that wear, watches that go, and a 
thousand more such good things, are the inven- 
tion of the philistines." We may use Arnold's 
epithet derisively, as the Frenchman uses the 
epithet " bourgeois," but we must recognize in 
the class thus described the steadying force 
which normally keeps society in its grooves, and 
which, when those grooves are seen to be out- 
worn, does not shrink from the heavy task of 
setting it into new ones. 

The idealistic mind, impatient with the slow 
march of progress, cannot do full justice to these 



qualities, and we must confess that Mr. Brooks's 
arraignment strikes a responsive chord in our 
consciousness. Every phrase of it brings up 
suggestions of things that are deplorably wrong, 
and that shake even a robust faith in democracy 
as we see it applied to our society. How true it 
is that the best intelligence of the country seems 
quite unavailing to correct these evils. How 
often are we made to realize that our public is 
"a willing slave of words, a willing follower of 
the fatal short cut, a prey to caprice, unreason- 
ing sentiment, and the attraction of panaceas." 
Let the meteoric career of the Progressive Party 
during the past year attest the justice of this 
criticism. How " the hall-mark of an honestly 
unconscious parochialism" is visibly stamped 
upon the meddlesome legislation which seeks to 
regulate our eating and drinking and clothing, 
which imposes an ignorant police censorship 
upon our art and literature and amusements. 
The long life of unreasoning prejudice, the shal- 
lowness of popular thinking, the lack of fixed 
standards for our conduct, the amazing success 
with which crazes fix themselves upon us, the 
way in which we fly counter to all the teachings 
of experience in our public policies, are matters 
which force themselves upon us with painful 
frequency, and almost make us despair of our 
civilization. And all these unlovely phenomena 
are the direct outcome of the workings of the 
middle-class mind, and are daily illustrated in 
the pages of its favorite newspapers, and in the 
utterances of its popular preachers and poli- 
ticians. 

It is middle-class taste and intelligence that 
maintain gutter journalism, and the imbecility 
of musical comedy, and the inane novel, and 
the ragtime song, and the comic supplement. 
Indeed, where any form of artistic expression is 
concerned, the middle-class mind is hopelessly 
at sea, and remains wedded to its ugly idols 
despite all the assaults made upon its citadel. 
As Moody once wrote in a letter: "Calliope is 
the one Muse we recognize, and she has a front 
spare bedroom and unlimited pie." Especially 
does it lay its blighting touch upon the fine art 
of education, and under its control our public 
schools become every year more soddenly inef- 
ficient. The democratic society in which its 
ideals prevail has only contempt for the finer 
manifestations of the human spirit, and makes 
no secret of its hatred for every kind of real 
distinction. Thus we see that the middle-class 
mind has the defects of its qualities, and even 
to the vision not wholly jaundiced the defects 
may loom so large in the foreground as to

obscure the sterling qualities that lie behind. 
Such as it is, we have to reckon with it every 
day of our lives, and we can never quite escape 
from the consciousness of its clammy hold upon 
our limed souls struggling to be free. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE VISIT OF JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL TO 
CHICAGO in 1887, and the unfortunate controversy 
resulting from his substitution of an address on 
Shakespearean criticism for the address on American 
politics which was expected of him, was the subject 
of an article published July 1 in this journal. One 
of the by-products of that visit was a small volume 
of veiled scurrility, published anonymously soon 
afterward, the work of Mr. Frank M. Bristol, a 
Methodist minister then living in this city, who was 
one of the most vociferous and vituperative of Mr. 
Lowell's assailants. The title of this volume was 
"Richard the Third and the Primrose Criticism." 
We have lately received a deeply interesting letter 
on the subject from one of Lowell's friends who does 
not wish to be named, and from which we print the 
following extracts: 

" I read to-day with great pleasure your article, ' A Page 
of Ancient History.' A life-long intimate friend of Mr. 
Lowell, I knew the pain the circumstances gave him, and 
I have always regretted that there was no full public record 
of his position. I have almost equally regretted during 
the last five years an extraordinary mistake that is con- 
nected with Mr. Lowell's Chicago visit. In the ' Variorum ' 
edition of 'Richard the Third' (H. H. Furness, Jr.), pub- 
lished in 1908, there is a note on p. 581 attributed to J. R. 
Lowell. This note expresses opinions precisely opposed to 
those held by Mr. Lowell. I wrote at once to Mr. Furness 
expressing my astonishment at this (to me) utterly indefen- 
sible and injurious carelessness, and pointing out that Mr. 
Lowell's views were distinctly stated in his essay on ' Richard 
the Third,' published in the (posthumous) volume, ' Latest 
Literary Essays' (1898). Mr. Furness wrote to me in answer 
(Dec. 30, 1908) : ' You are quite right. The " Primrose 
Criticism " is not by J. R. Lowell, but by F. M. Bristol, as 
was pointed out to me by a correspondent shortly after the 
publication of my volume of Richard III. I was misled by 
a copy of the book in which the name of " Lowell r ' was 
written on the title page in pencil. No other name appears 
throughout the book, nor is J. R. Lowell mentioned by 
name : though the whole work is evidently a violent attack 
on his Chicago lecture. [It is certainly odd to make a long 
and important citation without reading the work containing 
it.] I have corrected the error in the second edition, which 
is to appear early in the new year.' I have not seen this 
second edition, and do not know how properly he corrected 
this atrocious error, but I think it very insufficient action. 
I had said to him that I thought he ought immediately to 
declare the error (I implied with an apology to Lowell's 
memory) in the ' Nation.' (I did not know THE DIAL as 
well then as now.) Those who own the first edition are 
little likely to see the second, or to become aware of the 
correction in a note, and I have never seen any notice of it. 
I enclose the passage from Mr. Lowell's essay most worth 
printing in contrast to the note." 

The passage, as written in 1883, is as follows : 

" I believe it absolutely safe to say of Shakespeare that 
he never wrote deliberate nonsense, nor was knowingly 
guilty of defective metre ; yet even tests like these I would 
apply with commendable modesty and literary reserve, con- 



scious that the meaning of words, and still more the associa- 
tions they call up, have changed since Shakespeare's day ; 
that the accentuation of some was variable, and that Shake- 
peare's ear may very likely have been as delicate as his 
other senses. ... I am convinced that if we had Shake- 
speare's plays as he wrote them ... we should not find a 
demonstrably/aw/ty verse.'' 

HOT- WEATHER BEADING ought, for the sake of 
one's physical comfort, to be of such a nature that its 
stimulus will fall short of excitement, its argument 
run not to heated disputation, its imagery tend to 
evoke cooling rather than calorific mental visions, 
and its narrative have an equable flow like the stream 
of a shaded meadow brook. Attention has been 
called to the peculiar fitness of Trollope's novels for 
hot-weather reading. Theirs is a gentle surface 
titillation that never stirs the depths; the heroes 
and heroines tear no passion to tatters; the happy 
ending, with due apportionment of rewards and 
punishments, can be counted on to a certainty. 
Among other excellent dog-day books, it may be 
permitted to mention Franklin's ever-entertaining 
aucobiography (a good edition of which is now to be 
had, at small expense, in "Everyman's Library"). 
The calmness and evenness of its style are unsur- 
passed. Admirable was the method its writer 
adopted to avoid needless friction and heat in con- 
versation and debate, denying himself the use of 
such positive expressions as "certainly" and "un- 
doubtedly," and substituting instead the less pro- 
vocative "I conceive" or "I apprehend," or "I 
imagine," or "so it appears to me at present." 
" And this mode," he says, " which I at first put on 
with some violence to natural inclination, became at 
length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps 
for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a 
dogmatical expression escape me." Cooling to one 
of fervid temperament is the account he gives of the 
way he won over an enemy in the General Assembly. 
"Having heard that he had in his library a certain 
very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, 
expressing my desire of perusing that book, and 
requesting he would do me the favour of lending it 
to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and 
I returned it in about a week with another note, 
expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When 
we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which 
he had never done before), and with great civility; 
and he ever after manifested a great readiness to 
serve me on all occasions, so that we became great 
friends, and our friendship continued to his death." 
Truly, the pages of this admirable book seem to 
waft cool breezes as one turns the leaves on a warm 
summer day. ... 

UNPOETIC DEVOTIONAL VERSE, glowing, it may 
be, with religious ardor and throbbing with ecstatic 
emotion, but abounding in inappropriate or even 
ludicrous imagery, in clumsy expressions and faults 
of rhyme and rhythm, can easily be cited by anyone 
familiar with the hymns of the church. Opening 
this moment that well-known hymnal compiled by 
Dr. Charles S. Robinson and entitled "A Selection 



102 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



of Spiritual Songs," we chance upon A. R. Cousin's 
"Immanuel's Land," near the end of which the 
writer avows his intention to ga/e, not at glory, 
"but on my King of Grace not at the crown he 
gifteth, but on his pierced hand." Is "gifteth" 
chosen in preference to "giveth" because of a 
fancied superiority in elegance or spirituality, or is 
it simply a misprint? In the same book, hymn 1005, 
there is a sounding couplet about " the effluence of 
uncreated light " that might without excessive harsh- 
ness be called mystical nonsense. A correspondent 
wrote the other day to a certain religious weekly 
published in Boston asking for help in finding a 
dimly-remembered hymn which contains the ignobly- 
jubilant refrain, "Nothing more have I to do; Jesus 
paid it all." Somewhat akin to the mood inspiring 
this is that which prompted the couplet (said to oc- 
cur in an old Methodist hymn, and, according to Mr. 
Lucas, keenly relished by Charles Lamb), "Come 
needy, come guilty, come loathsome and bare; you 
can't come too filthy come just as you are." In 
a late number of "The English Review" Professor 
W. H. D. Rouse writes on "Our 'Melancholy' 
Hymnal," deploring the inferior quality of much of 
the devotional verse now in use, and selecting for 
censure certain familiar hymns. After pointing out 
sundry faults in one of these, he says : " The rest of 
the hymn is of like doggerel. It would be only too 
easy to multiply examples of these childish devices. 
It is unlucky that piety seems so fond also of mix- 
ing metaphors ; so that a voice is spurned, the Deity 
is at once a rock and a creature with wings, a stream, 
a support, a covering. Bonar makes a staff and 
buckler guide, Keble compares the Holy Dove to a 
gale ; even an accomplished scholar like Stanley fills 
his verses with senseless padding and vulgar tags, 
and appears to be amply satisfied." Nevertheless, 
with all their shortcomings, our hymns of to-day are 
far superior to those in use a century ago, and the 
improvement is still in progress. 



WHAT THEY READ IN THE PHILIPPINES is partly 
indicated by the latest number that has reached us 
of the "Bulletin of the Philippine Library" (Vol. I., 
No. 9). Nine and one-half double-column pages 
are filled with titles of "recent accessions," while 
two more pages announce the " duplicates in the 
Filipiniana division offered for sale or exchange." 
Standard works, chiefly in English or Spanish, with 
a few in Latin in the departments of philosophy and 
religion, and a considerable number of books on 
" the linguistics of the Philippine Islands," make 
up the greater part of the list of late additions to 
this young but evidently vigorous public library. 
Its users are now in the fortunate position of being 
able to choose between Michaele Sanchez's " Cursus 
Theologiae Dogmaticse " and Mrs. Alice Caldwell 
Hegan Rice's " Romance of Billy-goat Hill," or 
between Sophocles in Plumptre's translation and 
Mark Twain's " Old Times on the Mississippi " 
with other alternatives too numerous to mention. 
The opening pages of the Bulletin are devoted to 



" School Libraries in the Philippines." We quote 
the first paragraph : " During the last six or eight 
years the library movement in the Philippine schools 
has developed into an important factor among the 
aids to education. Beginning as it did in a tenta- 
tive effort to gather a few books together in a con- 
venient place for the use of students, it has now 
reached the stage where ' our library ' is a matter 
of pride with nearly every student. Few schools 
in Manila are so unprogressive as not to own some 
sort of a library usually provided by the work of 
the students themselves, while the movement has 
spread to the provinces, making such rapid headway 
that nearly a year ago the Bureau of Education 
found it necessary to get out a bulletin of forty pages 
entitled ' Libraries for Philippine Public Schools.' " 

THE CLASSICAL STYLE OF DR. ROBERT BRIDGES, 
England's new poet laureate, is made the subject of 
comment (usually laudatory) in various quarters. Mr. 
Henry C. Shelley, London literary correspondent of 
the Boston "Transcript," writes in the following 
strain concerning Mr. Austin's successor: "He is, 
above all things, a scholarly poet, an experimenter 
in metre, and a restorer of classical models. As a 
metrist he is accounted among the most subtle of 
modern days and learned even to difficulty. In 
blank verse he is regarded as the equal of Ten- 
nyson; he was the first to re-introduce the triolet 
into English, while in such a poem as his ' Ode on 
Peace ' he illustrates his command of Alcaics. Now 
a poet who sets himself to write English verse in 
classical metres must of necessity handicap himself, 
but a consciousness of that fact has not deterred 
Mr. Bridges from indulging his personal preference. 
To all this has to be added the further obstacle that 
he has few purple patches or brilliant epigrams; 
one of his greatest admirers has confessed that ' his 
charm is subtle and wins gradually on the ear and on 
the mind. His fragrance is not that of "voluptuous 
garden roses," but delicate, natural, wilding. His 
note is unforced. He has little or no rhetoric. 
His colors are true and tender, not gaudy or hot.' 
Moreover, the themes which appeal to Mr. Bridges 
are hardly those which capture the most attention. 
True, he touches now and then upon love in a 
restrained manner, but his preference is .for such 
subjects as lend themselves best to the use of classical 
scholarship and a spirit of philosophical musing." 
Whether he is one's favorite sort of poet or not, his 
poetic gift is unquestioned, and his appointment is 
made the subject of no such jesting comment as was 
noticeable when his predecessor took the place left 
vacant by Tennyson. 

LOCAL HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS such as many 
libraries, especially State university libraries in the 
West, pride themselves on making as completely 
representative and illustrative of their particular 
section as possible, form the rich mines in which 
future historians will delve with profit and pleasure. 
Nineteen years ago the library of the University of 
Illinois made its first systematic and earnest attempt 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



103 



to get together all that was valuable and available in 
the written history of the surrounding region; and 
since then gratifying progress has been made in this 
work. The historical collection formed under the 
direction of Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites at Madison 
is widely known among students and writers of 
history. Minnesota and Kansas have at their State 
universities similar collections of great and ever- 
increasing value ; and other regions are equally for- 
tunate. In the Newberry Library at Chicago the 
department of regional history is notably strong, and 
that at the University of Chicago Library has very 
recently been strengthened by the addition of the 
Durett collection on the early history of the vast 
region to the westward of the Alleghany Mountains. 
From published accounts of this collection, which is 
said to number nearly thirty thousand volumes, it 
appears to contain complete files of many early 
western newspapers, the manuscript autobiography 
and journal of George Rogers Clark, the journal of 
Thomas Walker, first of Englishmen to cross the 
Mississippi valley, that of the French explorer, 
Celeron, the McAfee and Shelby papers relating to 
Kentucky, papers of General Wilkinson, English 
and Spanish transcripts of early documents, and 
diaries and letters of many now forgotten early 
explorers of the great West. With its other like 
collections of material for the study of local and 
more widely regional history, Chicago now becomes 
more than ever attractive to those interested in the 
story of western American discovery and settlement 
and progress. . . . 

SHAKESPEARE IN GERMANY, if one is to believe 
what a high authority, Professor Alois Brandl, of 
the University of Berlin, said in his late address 
before the British Academy, has an even greater 
vogue than with those who speak his own language. 
His spirit appears to be verily alive among the 
Teutons, where, on an average, there are four per- 
formances of his plays every night throughout the 
year. Innumerable repertory companies are always 
at work on Shakespeare, and there is no sign of any 
diminution of interest in his dramas ; rather is this 
interest increasing and spreading through the coun- 
try, fostered especially by the municipal theatre 
with its regular and well-trained company of actors. 
In Germany it seems to be considered a reproach 
for a town not to have a theatre of its own ; and as 
for demanding rent for its use, the city fathers 
would blush at the mere suggestion, so eager are 
they to help rather than to hinder the cause of the 
drama in its best and worthiest examples. And so 
no small share of the attention of the municipal 
theatre is devoted to adequate presentation of Shake- 
speare. Thus it has come about, it is said, that 
Shakespearean phrases and quotations have a re- 
markable vogue in Germany, and Shakespearean 
and other English studies are encouraged in the 
schools and universities. In this connection we 
recall our pleased surprise on hearing, in long-ago 
student days in Berlin, our landlady's ready and 



apt quotation from Hamlet's soliloquy in the course 
of the table-talk one morning soon after our arrival. 
How many English or American landladies will one 
hear quoting Shakespeare to their boarders at the 
breakfast-table? . . . 

A PUBLISHER'S PROTEST against a protective 
tariff on books ought to have greater weight with our 
government authorities than the protest of a book- 
buyer, although even the latter's remonstrance is 
worthy of respectful consideration. Mr. George 
Haven Putnam, returning recently from London, 
and learning of the threatened imposition of a tax 
on importations of books in foreign languages, ad- 
dresses a letter to the chairman of the House Com- 
mittee on Ways and Means, in the course of which 
he says: "I am writing on behalf of the American 
Publishers' Copyright League to make clear to your 
Honorable Committee that the publishers and the 
book trade generally consider such a tax unnecessary, 
undesirable, and inexpedient even on the basis of a 
protectionist policy, while its enactment would consti- 
tute a material inconsistency in the policy announced 
by the present Congressional majority and the Ad- 
ministration. We look with confidence to your Com- 
mittee to decline to give favorable consideration to 
any such suggestion. I am myself a printer and a 
book-manufacturer as well as a publisher, and I am 
expressing not only my individual judgment and 
that of my firm, but that of the American publishers 
generally in the statement that we have no need of 
any special assistance from the United States Gov- 
ernment to maintain the foundations of our business." 
What possible pretext, then, can there be for laying 
any sort of duty on literature? The revenue accru- 
ing will be inconsiderable in any event, while those 
from whose pockets it is taken are as a rule least 
able to bear the extortion. 

THE OPENING OF THE NEW STATE LIBRARY OF 

NEW YORK at Albany is cause for congratulation to 
all concerned. In addition to a full description of 
the new State Education Building where the Library 
has its home, there is published a smaller illustrated 
pamphlet setting forth the numerous modern con- 
veniences and admirable equipment of the library 
quarters recently thrown open to the public. The 
reader is thus ushered into this palace of literature : 
" From the main entrance the public reading rooms 
are reached by a staircase twenty-five feet wide, 
leading directly into the central rotunda, the most 
striking feature of the building. It is cruciform, like 
an Italian church. Both the nave and the transept, 
as they may aptly be termed, are vaulted and at the 
crossing are crowned with a dome which runs up 
through three stories. The centre of this rotunda 
forms the architectural centre of the building, and 
from there access is had to the five principal reading 
rooms ; or better stated, perhaps, a group of five 
special libraries law, medicine, periodicals, legis- 
lative reference and public documents, and the 
principal reference room. The latter seems likely 



104 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



to rank as one of the handsomest and most satisfac- 
tory reading rooms in the country. One hundred 
and twenty-five by one hundred and seven feet and 
fifty-five feet high, extending through the second 
and third floors, it is an adaptation of the reading 
room of the Bibliotheque Rationale in Paris." The 
descriptive pamphlet extends to twenty-eight pages 
of matter especially interesting to librarians and 
library architects. . . . 

THE BOOK TO WHICH ENGLISH LITERATURE is 
MOST INDEBTED is, of course, the Bible; and the 
extent of that indebtedness will be at least partly 
realized by readers of Professor William Gilmer 
Perry's article on the subject in the August "North 
American Review." Amusing is the story he tells 
to illustrate Macaulay's early employment of scrip- 
ture phrase, which all the world knows the great 
historian and essayist later used so often and to such 
excellent effect. Finding one day that the maid 
had disarranged the pebbles marking off his little 
garden, the boy Macaulay exclaimed: "Cursed be 
Sally! For it is written, 'Cursed be he that re- 
moveth his neighbor's landmark.'" Significant is 
the fondness with which the English-speaking world 
clings to the phraseology of the King James version 
of the Bible and refuses to accept any later and, 
philologically, more accurate rendering. Mrs. Barr, 
in her recently-published autobiography, takes plea- 
sure in fortifying her own preference for the old 
version by relating her conversation with one of the 
authors of the "Revised Version" who always carried 
a New Testament in his pocket and declared his 
attachment to the little volume, which, on examina- 
tion, proved not to be the translation in which he had 
himself collaborated, but the much older and less 
scholarly one that it was designed to supersede. 


THE PROBLEM OF THE LEATHER BINDING, the 

best way, if there be any way, to preserve its flexi- 
bility and prevent its going to pieces at the hinges, 
is instructively touched upon by Miss Janet C. 
Lewis in the current issue of "Special Libraries." 
But she withholds the most valuable and practically 
useful part of her knowledge on the subject; for, 
after relating her varied experience with leather 
bindings and holding our breathless attention to the 
point where, after much unsuccessful experimenting, 
she at last "obtained an animal and vegetable oil 
combined which owing to its penetration has proved 
to be an excellent lubricant and food for the leather," 
she abruptly and unkindly leaves us to guess if we 
can the magic formula used by her in the composi- 
tion of this elixir of life for leather-bound books. 
Nevertheless, some of the observations that precede 
this cruel betrayal of our faith are worth quoting. 
She says : " Surface lubricating is of very little real 
avail, as in the use of vaseline or lucelline or like 
mineral oils, which lack the essential penetrating 
qualities owing to their being of a mineral nature. 
An animal or a vegetable oil is the only kind which 
the leather really absorbs." We are further cau- 



tioned not to shut up our leather-bound books in 
glass cases or where there is insufficient circulation 
of air. Perhaps it is only with benevolent intent 
that Miss Lewis leaves us to the uncertainties, the 
disappointments, the suspense, and the anxiety of 
experimentation, in order that ours may be the full 
joy of final success if perchance we achieve it. 

A NOTEWORTHY BIT OF TOMBSTONE VERSE, from 

the hand of a distinguished poet, may be read on the 
slab that marks the grave of J. A. Howells, lately 
deceased, brother of Mr. William Dean Howells. 
The early life of the eminent novelist, poet, and 
essayist, his boyhood experience of newspaper 
work in the office of the Ashtabula " Sentinel," which 
his father edited, and his early contracting there of 
a fondness for printer's ink, which has never left 
him, is too old a story to need repetition here. 
His brother, J. A. Howells, succeeded in due time 
to the editorship of the "Sentinel," and on the 
"make-up" stone long used by him in his work as 
printer are now inscribed the lines that commemo- 
rate his fifty years' connection with the paper. His 
death occurred at Jefferson, Ohio, and there his 
grave and his tombstone are to be seen. The epi- 
taph runs as follows: 

" Stone upon which with hands of boy and man 
He framed the history of his time until, 
Week after week, the varying record ran 
To its half -century tale of well and ill, 
Remember now how true, through all these days, 
He was friend, brother, husband, son 
Fill the whole limit of your space with praise. 
There needs no room for blame blame there was none." 

ART AND JUSTICE are conceived of by the author 
of " Jean-Christophe " as sustaining a peculiarly close 
relation to each other. Mr. Alvan F. Sanborn, in 
a thoughtful article on M. Romain Rolland in the 
August " Century," quotes him as maintaining that 
" he who can see injustice without trying to combat 
it is neither entirely an artist nor entirely a man," 
and tells us how his artist-soul was aroused to protest 
by the Dreyfus episode and by the Boer War. It 
is largely to this spirit of revolt against observed 
acts of injustice that we owe the hero biographies 
which he gave to the world with these stirring words : 
" The air is heavy about us. Old Europe is waxing 
torpid in an oppressive and vitiated atmosphere. A 
materialism devoid of grandeur cumbers thought and 
fetters the action of governments and of individuals. 
The world is dying of asphyxia in its prudent and 
vile egoism. The world is stifling. Fling the win- 
dows wide open ! Let the free air rush in ! Let 
us inhale the vivifying breath of the heroes ! " And 
the same spirit helps to animate the ten volumes of 
his famous " Jean-Christophe." 



AMERICAN RECOGNITION OF JAPANESE CULTURE

Masaharu Anesaki, of the Imperial University, 
Tokio, to fill the chair, is another evidence of the 
praiseworthy readiness of the West to sit as a dis- 
ciple at the feet of the older East. At present 
engaged in teaching the science of religion at the 
Tokio institution, Professor Anesaki is reputed as 
well versed in the history and doctrines of Chris- 
tianity as in those of his own faith, Buddhism ; and 
though still comparatively young, having been born 
in 1873, he is the author of a number of works of 
oriental learning, such as "The History of Indian 
Religions" and "The Personality of Buddha," and 
has distinguished himself also in less serious depart- 
ments of literature in his native Japanese. Even 
short stories are credited to his versatile pen, and 
he is said to write almost as well in French and 
English as in his own language. The special sub- 
ject to which he has of late devoted himself has to do 
with the Pali texts of Buddhism and their Chinese 
counterparts. 

THE CRITICAL BOOKSELLER, tradesman, and pro- 
fessor of literature combined, more joyful over the 
sale of one good book than over that of a hundred 
best-sellers of the passing hour, is rarely or never 
met with in real life ; hence our pleasure in greeting 
him in the person of the idealist hero of Mr. How- 
ells's story, " The Critical Book Store," in the August 
" Harper's Magazine," and our regret that this 
example of what a bookseller ought to be so soon 
lost faith in his mission and sold out to one inspired 
with less exalted ideals. But of course the plan was 
too good to succeed except in a bookshop endowed 
and conducted as a public educational institution 
somewhat like the public library, which, untainted 
by commercial greed and managed by well-educated 
and high-minded officers, is in a position to accom- 
plish much that no tradesman, dependent for support 
on the profits of his business, can ever hope to 
achieve. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

SIMPLIFIED SPELLING ONCE MORE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your gracious and discriminating editorial on 
" Robert Bridges, Poet Laureate," speaking of spelling- 
reform you say that Dr. Bridges would " certainly 
regard such abortions as ' thru ' and ' program ' as 
typically horrible." 

If " program " without the wasted ending me is hor- 
rible, why should not " epigram " and " monogram " be 
also restored to their Gallic rights ? If we must have 
the sporadic and unnecessary u in " honor " and " par- 
lor," why not in " tenor " and in dozens of other words 
of similar Latin derivation? Why not indeed found a 
society for Decorative Spelling? I have a book in 
which Milton's "sovran" ("plain in its neatness") is 
spelt " soueraygne," and nearly every other word has 
accretions which would rejoice the most conservative of 
conservatives. 5Tet every once in a while in books of 
the same period there are examples of typical simplifi- 



cation which would rejoice the fiery heart of the learned 
and genial Dr. Scott t used for ed, "tho " for "though," 
and the like. Indeed scarcely one of the recommenda- 
tions of the Simplified Spelling Board cannot be sup- 
ported by pre- Johnsonian printers. The dislike of any 
given spelling is merely a matter of prejudice, and after 
a while the absurd and inconsistent vagaries of the 
present system will seem as ridiculous and awkward as 
would an ichthyosaurus or a pterodactyl strutting round 
in a barnyard. 

It is a fact, 1 believe, that a vast majority of the best 
English scholars approve of reformed spelling; and 
while personally I should find it difficult to adopt the 
transmogrifying system recommended by the English 
Society, I do think that the majority of the simplifica- 
tions contained in the revised list of the American 
Simplified Spelling Board are in the line of a much- 
needed improvement. Germany has within a few years 
successfully simplified some thousands of words, and no 
one can doubt that the general superiority of German 
students over the American and English (even with the 
terrible handicap of stupefying beer) is due to the 
earlier age at which they can begin really to study, 
while our children are obliged to spend many months 
in trying to master an illogical and absolutely unscientific 
spelling-book. As Superintendent Maxwell of Manhattan 
says, it tends to make the mind unethical to find no 
analogies, and has a bad effect on the morals. So 
although he detests "thru" for " through," and similar 
guillotinements of words, he would for the sake espe- 
cially of the immigrants cause simplified spelling to be 
adopted by the Public Schools of New York if it were 
in his power to do so. 

I realize how useless it is to argue against a prejudice, 
especially in trifling matters. Marriages have been 
ruined by the finical crook of a little finger or the curl 
of a mustache, and words are dear to those that use 
them. I think I lost the friendship of a fine Englishman 
because I preferred to spell " Tolstoi," while he wanted 
to reform it backwards to " Tolstoy." I recognize the 
insuperable difficulty of a phonetic method of repre- 
senting English (with all the varieties of local or na- 
tional pronunciation) ; but it is better to reform some 
vices, even if one can't cure them all, than to go on 
forever dragging the chain of obvious crudities and 
anachronisms. A little light is better than total dark- 
ness, and I rejoice every time I see a " thru " and a 
"quartet" and a "program." It is a step in the right 
direction. NATHAN HASKEIX DOLE. 

" Hedgecote," Glen Road, Boston, Mass., Aug. 7, 1913. 

[Our correspondent attempts no defense of "thru," 
and so we are not called upon to explain how such 
a spelling destroys the proper pronunciation of the 
word. The reason why we consider " program " 
horrible is that it inevitably leads to a pronunciation 
which accents the first syllable, and reduces the 
second to an inconsiderable caudal appendix. We 
hear the word pronounced " prd-gram " every day 
with the " gram " almost lost. We know of no way 
to keep the full value of the second syllable (which 
means preserving the dignity of a fine old word) 
without spelling it in the orthodox way. " Epigram," 
" monogram," and " telegram " are not cases in point, 
for the excellent reason that they are three- syllabled 
words, which makes it almost impossible not to give

the " gram " its full value in their pronunciation. 
This is so elementary that we are almost ashamed 
to write it. As to the general question of a forced 
simplification of spelling upon logical lines, we do 
not consider it arguable, because it is so essentially a 
matter of taste. Such " arguments " as are advanced 
in behalf of the " reform " seem to us too shallow 
to be deserving of serious consideration. EDITOR

THE VARIORUM "JULIUS C^SAR." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with interest and profit the review of 
the latest addition to the " New Variorum " Shake- 
speare, in THE DIAL of July 16. This impresses me 
as in some respects the most thorough, candid, and just 
review of a book that has appeared in your columns in 
many moons. 

The reviewer lists a dizzy number of errors in spell- 
ing, punctuation, etc. It seems to me that Dr. Furness 
went from one extreme to another when, after making 
in five plays a text of his own, he adopted the First 
Folio text not only as to words, but also as to the old 
style spelling and even type forms. While I can 
understand that " what Shakespeare wrote depends 
very largely upon a knowledge of the peculiarities of 
the language of his day, that Elizabethan English is a 
wholly different thing from modern English, and that 
the poet's linguistic peculiarities were the peculiarities 
of his age," it seems to me that if our "New Variorum" 
editor would supply extracts from the writings of lin- 
guists explaining these peculiarities to the uninitiate 
and at the same time would give the text in modern 
form, Shakespeare's meaning could not only be more 
easily studied but such errors as your reviewer cites 
could not occur. The editor would also profit in that 
he would be required to give less attention to the 
mechanical side of his work, and the appeal of the 
Shakespeare spirit in him would be more fully emanci- 
pated. 

Scholarly and varied as are the suggestions of your 
reviewer, it seems curious to me that one who appre- 
ciates the dramatic effect that was served by the inven- 
tion of Caesar's deafness in the left ear, should have 
apparently accepted the following statement from Mr. 
Furness unchallenged: "He [Csar] is a braggart, 
inflated with the idea of his own importance; speaking 
of his decrees as of those of a god." It seems to me 
that the son has here departed from the editorial atti- 
tude of the father in obtruding a dogmatic view of a 
character. It has been often said that Dr. Furness 
accepted the Werder theory of Hamlet, but there is not 
one word in his Preface to the play that warrants 
such'citation; although Dr. Ernest Jones cites the vol- 
umes as his authority for such a statement, and Dr. 
Rolfe dwelt upon the amount of space given the Werder 
views after having cited Dr. Furness as having accepted 
them. The point is that here, as in all the other plays, 
Dr. Furness maintained the editorial attitude that wel- 
comes all views of any merit whatever but adopts no one 
as a final solution. It was this attitude that, in the last 
analysis, found sustenance in that sense of humor in 
which Shakespeare's own unobtrusive ego was so easily 
and delightfully felt. I do not believe that "Julius 
Caesar apparently held a prominent place as an historic 
character in Shakespeare's regard " any more than I 



believe that Antony and Cleopatra held a like place in 
Shakespeare's regard ; and we know that Miss Repplier, 
a life-long friend of Dr. Furness, never could under- 
stand the admiration that Dr. Furness had for the 
Shakespearean Cleopatra. Perhaps she could not sep- 
arate the historic character from the wonderful uni- 
versal woman that, in our poet's "brightest heaven of 
invention," made his Cleopatra an elder sister of his 
Juliet. 

What the Ghost was to the play of " Hamlet," 
Julius Caesar was to the play that bears his name ; and 
what seems to us the " braggart " in Csesar may 
be only a result of the theatrical atmosphere created 
by the poet for the purpose of making the character 
dominate the play. It was not the historic character 
that Shakespeare had chiefly in mind, but a play in 
which he was seeking for dramatic elements. The 
Ghost in " Hamlet " was not more affectionate and 
noble than was Shakespeare's Csesar; and we might go 
on, if we had space, and show by dramatic incidents and 
similarity of language that the two plays were written 
almost in the same mood of mind, the contemporary 
interests of the London crowd always transcending the 
poet's interest in the classic history of Roman plebeians. 
It seems to me that in the notes to the new "Variorum" 
edition, especially at the close of the book, too much 
attention is given to the play in its historic bearings 
and not enough attention to the play as a Shakespeare

A BIT OF IMPROMPTU VERSE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

One morning in the year 1868, Benjamin F. Taylor, 
a well-known writer of the days of the Civil War and 
thereabouts, who spent much time in or near La Porte, 
Indiana, paid a call at the home of Judge William Piatt 
Andrew of that village, under whose roof Mr. Ogden 
Ross, father of Mrs. Andrew, was fast nearing his 
ninety-seventh birthday. As Mr. Ross was somewhat 
indisposed, Mr. Taylor offered to leave a summons at 
the nearby office of Dr. N. S. Darling, as he should pass 
down the shady street. Not finding Dr. Darling within, 
Mr. Taylor took up the pencil which, in those times, 
hung beside a slate fixed to the jamb of every well- 
regulated office-door, and wrote the following lines, 
which were recently given me by the daughter of Mr. 
Ross, now in her ninety-sixth year: 
"I saw a man just up the street 
In whom both Age and Childhood meet. 
Was born in Seventeen Seventy-One ; 
Saw that age pass, and this begun. 
If three more years he lingers here 
They say he '11 count his hundredth year. 
Like almond blossoms shines his hair, 
His brow is furrowed deep with care. 
This Man of Ross is sadly ill ; 
Have you no potion, powder, pill, 
To make his heart beat strong again, 
And bring new strength to breast and brain ? 
' What his complaint ? ' I hear you say ; 
' The books will clear my doubtful way.' 
Nay ! nay ! Not so, consult no page, 
For his disease is called Old Age ! " 
Not great poetry, but very fair impromptu verse, 
is it not ? SARA ANDREW SHAFER.

THE MERMAID COMPANY.* 



Two of the greatest English poets now living 
have found in the Mermaid Tavern a rich source 
of poetical inspiration. What theme, indeed, 
could be more fruitful than that of the meeting- 
place of Shakespeare and his fellow-wits in the 
spacious days when all Englishmen breathed 
the air of romance, and the world seemed won- 
derful beyond all past experience in the light of 
the new learning and the new art and the new 
adventurous enterprise that burst forth in that 
flowering of the human spirit which we call the 
Renaissance. Inexhaustible must have been the 
poetical inspiration of that glorious time, and 
the very thought of it still has power to widen 
man's horizon and set his imagination aglow. 
Some fifteen years ago Mr. Theodore Watts- 
Dunton published his magnificent lyrical master- 
piece, "Christmas at the Mermaid," and this 
year Mr. Alfred Noyes, in whom the hope of 
English poetry is now chiefly centred, has given 
us, in his "Tales of the Mermaid Tavern," a 
work so shining with beauty, and so opulent in 
poetical power, that it is difficult to find words 
with which to do it justice. The scheme of 
this work comprises nine numbers, and in the 
course of them all the chief manners of verse- 
composition lyrical, narrative, and dramatic 
find masterly illustration. In the opening 
pages, we find ourselves in the full tide of the 
mighty current that is to sweep us through the 
volume with an exhilarating sense of heightened 
capabilities and enlarged vision. 

" Marchannt Adventurers, chanting at the windlass, 
Early in the morning we slipped from Plymouth 

Sound, 
All for adventure in the great New Regions, 

All for Eldorado and to sail the world around ! 
Sing ! The red of sun-rise ripples round the bows again, 
Marchaunt Adventurers, O sing, we 're outward 

bound, 
All to stuff the sunset in our old black galleon, 

All to seek the merchandise that no man ever found, 
Marchaunt Adventurers ! 
Marchaunt Adventurers ! 

Marchaunt Adventurers, O, whither are ye bound? 
All for Eldorado and the great new Sky-line, 

All to seek the merchandise that no man ever found." 

This leads up to a ringing ballad, recited by 
Raleigh, of the last voyage and glorious death 
of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. 

" And dark and dark that night 'gan fall, 

And high the muttering breakers swelled, 

* TALES OF THE MERMAID TAVERN. By Alfred Noyes. 
Illustrated. New York : Frederick A. Stokes Co. 



Till that strange fire which seamen call 
' Castor and Pollux ' we beheld, 

" An evil sign of peril and death, 

Burning pale on the high main-mast; 
But calm with the might of Gennesareth 
Our Admirall's voice went ringing past, 

" Clear thro' the thunders, far and clear, 

Mighty to counsel, clear to command, 
Joyfully singing, 'We are as near 

To heaven, my lads, by sea as by land.' " 

In "A Coiner of Angels," the second num- 
ber of the cycle, the Mermaid wits have great 
sport in baiting Richard Bame, the zealot whose 
name history has preserved because of his scur- 
rilous attack upon Marlowe. Bame intrudes 
upon their revels with his pious snuffle, and is 
told of a pretended counterfeiting scheme where- 
by they all hope to make their fortunes. They 
fool him to the top of his bent, and he eagerly 
accepts their proposition to take the part of a 
stool-pigeon in the conspiracy. Number three 
is the "mad sea-tale" of "Black Bill's Honey- 
moon," sung to a goodly company by John 
Davis. But there is even more excellent fooling 
in the preface, for Francis Bacon has strolled 
into the tavern and discourses patronizingly on 
the art of poetry. 

" ' He said to Shakespeare, in a voice that gripped 
The Mermaid Tavern like an arctic frost: 

' There are no poets in this age of ours 
Not to compare with Plautus. They are all 
Dead, the men that were famous in old days' 

1 Why so they are,' said Will. The humming stopped. 

I saw poor Spenser, a shy gentle soul, 
With haunted eyes like starlit forest pools, 
Smuggling his cantos under his cloak again. 
' There 's verse enough, no doubt,' Bacon went on, 
' But English is no language for the Muse. 
Whom could you call our best ? There 's Gabriel 

Harvey, 

And Edward, Earl of Oxford. Then there 's Dyer, 
And Doctor Golding ; while, for tragedy, 
Thomas, Lord Buckhurst, hath a lofty vein. 
And, in a lighter prettier vein, why, Will, 
There is thyself! But where 's Euripides? 
1 Dead,' echoed Ben, in a deep ghost-like voice. 
And drip drip drip outside we heard the rain 
Miserably dripping round the Mermaid Inn." 

Later on, Bacon thus admonishes Shakespeare : 

" ' Will, couldst thou use 
Thy talents with discretion, and obey 
Classic examples, thou mightst match old Plautus, 
In all except priority of the tongue. 
This English tongue is only for an age, 
But Latin for all time. So I propose 
To embalm in Latin my philosophies. 
Well-seize your hour ! But, ere you die, you '11 sail 
A British galleon to the golden courts 
Of Cleopatra.' 

' Sail it ! ' Marlowe roared, 
Mimicking in a fit of thundrous glee

The drums and trumpets of his Tamburlaine: 
' And let her buccaneers bestride the sphinx, 
And play at bowls with Pharaoh's pyramids, 
And hale white Egypt with their tarry hands 
Home to the Mermaid ! ' ' 

In "The Sign of the Golden Shoe " we find 
the high-water mark of the poet's creation. 
This is the scene in which news of the death of 
Marlowe comes to his friends in the Mermaid 
Tavern, and his genius is extolled by his friends. 

'"Ah, then Kit,' 

Said Chapman, ' had some prescience of his end, 
Like many another dreamer. What strange hints 
Of things past, present, and to come, there lie 
Sealed in the magic pages of that music 
Which, laying strong hold on universal laws, 
Ranges beyond these mud-walls of the flesh, 
Though dull wits fail to follow. It was this 
That made men lind an oracle in the books 
Of Virgil, and an everlasting fount 
Of science in the prophets.' " 

It is Nash who tells the tragic story of Mar- 
lowe's death in the arms of a wanton. 

" What if his blood were hot ? High over all 

He heard, as in his song the world still hears, 
Those angels on the burning heavenly wall 

" Who chant the thunder-music of the spheres. 

Yet, through the glory of his own young dream 
Here did he meet that face, wet with strange tears, 

" Andromeda, with piteous face astream, 

Hailing him, Perseus. In her treacherous eyes 
And in dark pools the mirrored stars will gleam. 

" Here did he see his own eternal skies ; 

And here she laughed, nor found the dream amiss ; 
She bade him pluck and eat in Paradise. 

" Here did she hold him, broken up with bliss, 

Here, like a supple snake, around him coiled, 
Here did she pluck his heart out with a kiss, 

" Here were the wings clipped and the glory soiled, 

Here adders coupled in the pure white shrine, 
Here was the Wine spilt, and the Shew-bread 
spoiled." 

From Nash's elegy, which closes the superb 
poem, we take these stanzas : 

" The wine that God had set apart, 

The noblest wine of all, 
Wine of the grapes that angels trod, 
The vintage of the glory of God, 
The crimson wine of that rich heart, 
Spilt in a drunken brawl, 

" Poured out to make a steaming bath 

That night in the Devil's Inn, 
A steaming bath of living wine 
Poured out for Circe and her swine, 
A bath of blood for a harlot 
To supple and sleek her skin. 

" But he who dared the thunder-roll, 
Whose eagle-wings could soar, 



Buffeting down the clouds of night, 
To beat against the Light of Light, 
That great God-blinded eagle-soul, 
We shall not see him more." 

The fine and passionate intelligence with which 
Mr. Noyes has discerned and vitalized the very 
essence of Marlowe's genius makes this tribute 
worthy to be linked with " In the Bay," and 
we can imagine Swinburne smiling from the 
gold bar of heaven upon the kindred soul who 
henceforth must be reckoned with him as the 
poet's panegyrist. 

Passing over " The Companion of a Mile," we 
come to " Big Ben," which tells of the excite- 
ment at the Mermaid when Jonson lies in New- 
gate prison, and of the men's boisterous reception 
of their comrade when he reappears after his 
enlargement, accomplished through the efforts 
of Selden and Camden, playing upon the King's 
prejudice against tobacco. A few apt quotations 
from Ben did the business with His Majesty. 

"'Ah,' said the shrewd King, goggling his great eyes 

Cannily, ' did he not defame the Scots ? ' 
'That's true,' said Camden, like a man that hears 

Truth for the first time. ' O ay, he defam'd 'em ' 

The King said, very wisely, once again. 
'Ah, but,' says Camden, like a man that strives 

With more than mortal wit, ' only such Scots 

As flout your majesty, and take tobacco. 

He is a Scot, himself, and hath the gift 

Of preaching.' Then we gave him Jouson's lines 

Against Virginia, ' Neither do thou lust 

After that tawny weed; for who can tell 

Before the gathering and the making up 

What alligarta may have spawned thereon, 

Or words to that effect. 

< Magneeficent ! ' 

Spluttered the King ' who knows ? Who knows, 
indeed ? 

That 's a grand touch, that Alligarta, Camden ! ' 
'The Scot who wrote those great and splendid words,' 

Said Camden, 'languishes in Newgate, Sire; 

His ears and nose ' ' 

In "The Burial of a Queen," the sexton, 
Timothy Scarlet, tells a weird tale of the inter- 
ment of Mary Stuart in the vault at Peter- 
borough, of how the Queen was buried secretly 
at night the official funeral of the next day 
being a farce with an empty coffin and of how 
that night the ghost of Chastelard forced its way 
into the vault and mourned the beloved of his 
youth. Interspersed in this narrative are some 
of the loveliest lyrics that Mr. Noyes has ever 
penned. 

" Ah, stained and ever stainless, 

Ah, white as her own hand, 
White as the wonder of that brow, 
Crowned with colder lilies now, 
White on the velvet darkness, 

The lilies of her land !

" The witch from over the water, 

The fay from over the foam, 
The bride that rode thro' Edmbro' town 
With satin shoes and a silken gown, 
A queen, and a great king's daughter 

Thus they carried her home, 

" With torches and with scutcheons, 

Unhonoured and unseen, 
With the lilies of France in the wind a-stir, 
And the Lion of Scotland over her, 
Darkly, in the dead of night, 

They carried the Queen, the Queen." 

One of the actors in this scene is Ford, who 

" Fell short of that celestial height 
Whereto the greatest only climb, who stand 
By Shakespeare, and accept the Eternal Law." 

The entire passage is too long to quote, but it 
constitutes a magnificently penetrating char- 
acterization of the author of "The Broken 
Heart." 

Passing by "Flos Mercatorum," which tells 
the story which Bow Bells chime, which is the 
story of Dick Whittington and the cat that 
brought him riches and the love of the fair Alice, 
and made him the patron saint of the London 
mart, we come to "Raleigh," the last poem of 
the cycle. Fleeing for refuge to the Mermaid, 
Raleigh, escaped from the Tower, finds Jonson, 
and pours forth his soul to him then goes forth 
to the black treachery that gave him up to death. 
The end of the history is told by his widow, 
shamefully entreated by Stukeley the betrayer, 
when the scoundrel visits her one night. The 
pathetic figure of Jonson, gray and solitary, 
remains with us at the close, a golden threnody 
swelling from his heart. 

" Marlowe is dead, and Greene is in his grave, 
And sweet Will Shakespeare long ago is gone ! 
Our Ocean-shepherd sleeps beneath the wave; 
Robin is dead, and Marlowe in his grave. 
W T hy should I stay to chant an idle stave, 

And in my Mermaid Tavern drink alone ? 
For Kit is dead and Greene is in bis grave, 

And sweet Will Shakespeare long ago is gone. 

" Where is the singer of the Faerie Queen ? 
Where are the lyric lips of Astrophel ? 
Long, long ago, their quiet graves were green; 
Ay, and the grave, too, of their Faerie Queen ! 
And yet their faces, hovering here unseen, 

Call me to taste their new-found cenomel; 
To sup with him who sang the Faerie Queen; 

To drink with him whose name was Astrophel. 

" I drink to the great Inn beyond the grave ! 
If there be none, the gods have done us wrong. 
Ere long I hope to chant a better stave, 
In some great Mermaid Inn beyond the grave; 
And quaff the best of earth that heaven can save, 

Red wine like blood, deep love of friends and song, 
I drink to that great Inn beyond the grave, 

And hope to greet my golden lads ere long." 



It was Virgil who plucked out the infinite sad- 
ness that lies at the heart of all such scenes as 
this when he wrote the immortal line, 
" Sunt lacrymse rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt." 
Mr. Noyes has not failed in his epilogue ; he has 
found just the right note upon which to end his 
cycle of song. 

We have let this great work speak for itself, 
as far as the limitations of space would permit, 
and no commentary can do much to heighten 
the sense of its power and beauty, of its rich 
and varied life, of its crowded action and poetic 
fire. Comparisons are idle ; those that chiefly 
suggest themselves are with Browning and 
Swinburne and Mr. Kipling. Mr. Noyes has 
the dramatic vitality of Browning, the lyrical 
rapture of Swinburne, and the poetic energy of 
Mr. Kipling. We do not find in him the per- 
fect finish of Tennysonian art, and Tennyson is 
perhaps the only one of the great Victorians 
whom his performance does not challenge. 
Certainly, we have no other poet now living 
whose work can measure up to these " Tales of 
the Mermaid Tavern," and no age of English 
poetry is so rich that it might not be proud to 
reckon this work among its greater glories.

DIVERGENT OPINIONS OF THE 
GOLDEN WEST.* 



The faults, the foibles, and the petty failings 
of the American people form the main theme 
of Mr. Arthur J. Johnson's "California: An 
Englishman's Impressions of the Golden State." 
The author's special bete noire is the "native 
son" of the Golden West, whose portrait is 
drawn in strong colors and with sharp contrasts. 
But the perspective of our would-be literary 
cubist is sadly amiss. His fault-finding eye is 
evidently much too close to a few annoying indi- 
viduals to make it possible for him to sketch in 
true proportions the real Californian, native 
born or adopted. Neither do his experiences 
of Western life, as portrayed in his work, lend 
any weight of authority to his jeremiads. It is 
not, however, merely the people whom he met 
who seem to him to deserve execration, but the 
land as well. Its fruits have no flavor, its flowers 
no odor, its birds (if there be any) no song. It

is too cold and too hot, too sunny and too foggy ; 
it is either too windy or there is not wind enough 
to blow away the mosquitoes. There is no game, 
and " game hogs ' ' abound. So runs the record of 
"one of the happiest years I have ever spent"! 
Doubtless all of these and the author's many 
other doleful observations may be abundantly 
verified in numerous specific instances by any- 
one attuned to the disagreeable elements of life, 
and keenly sensitive to the raw and crude ways 
of the frontier in a land of strong contrasts. 
But the picture is incomplete, and the colors 
are all from the wrong end of the spectrum. 
Of the real Calif ornians who are subduing the 
desert, who brought water through mountain 
ranges and across the sands to Los Angeles, 
who rebuilt San Francisco after earthquake and 
fire, and who are slowly but surely throttling 
the vicious elements in their midst and banish- 
ing the saloon and road-house (whose infre- 
quency our peripatetic writer so bemoans), Mr. 
Johnson knows nothing. His evaluation of 
nature is more generous, but equally erratic and 
insignificant. Little wonder that he opens his 
description of Mt. Shasta, the Fujiyama of 
California, with a fulsome discussion of the spit- 
toons of the thirteen saloons of Sisson ! Such 
a book as this serves no useful purpose, except 
possibly as a counter-irritant to the freely dis- 
tributed, generally more trustworthy, though 
more optimistic and, it may be, fulsome, printed 
matter of exploitation. 

An introduction to out-of-door California, 
written by one who, evidently in search of 
health, has found pleasure, comfort, and enjoy- 
ment in the mountains and deserts, and who 
has followed with zest the dusty roads and 
winding trails, is Mr. C. F. Saunders's "Under 
the Sky in California." The book professes 
"to give nothing more than a hint of the joy and 
interest that attend travel by unbeaten ways in Cali- 
fornia, of leisurely residence in the tourist belt. The 
State is still so young among American commonwealths, 
and her wide territories are still so little settled, that 
the lineaments of that virgin landscape which so de- 
lighted the pioneers, are yet far from obliterated. One 
may still camp on Fre'mont's trail in surroundings 
practically unchanged from those which the great Path- 
finder himself described sixty-odd years ago; may 
stumble over perhaps the selfsame stones that Pio 
Pico's horses kicked on the Spanish highroads that 
lead across the passes down to the desert and Old 
Mexico; may tread in the very footsteps of the Mission 
Fathers from San Diego to San Francisco Bay ; may 
look out from some peak of the Sierra's crest upon 
forests as yet unscarred by the lumberman and upon 
sage brush plains where the red Indian still dwells and 
sets up his thatched wickiup. 



" It is this nearness to the fresh morning of romance 
that gives a special zest to life under the sky in Cali- 
fornia, while one's physical frame is ever grateful for 
the ease with which one may come from such ventures 
into the wild, back to the comforts of a civilized life, 
there to talk it all over with one's friends, to rest and 
repair and to go again." 

It is not the California of the tourist who 
follows the beaten trail from one hotel to the 
next that is here revealed, but rather that dis- 
covered by two nature lovers of limited physical 
strength but with an aptitude for exploring and 
courage to try the unknown in desert and moun- 
tain wilderness. Its scenes are laid mainly in 
Southern California, but they might be enacted 
with equal pleasure in the central valleys and 
the foothills and forests of the Sierras and 
Coast Ranges to the north ; for the same favor- 
able climatic factors, with some differences as 
to temperatures and seasons, prevail throughout 
the length of California. 

One section of Mr. Saunders's book is de- 
voted to the desert when it blooms in the spring, 
another to camping in the Yosemite and a unique 
account of the "candle lighting" among the 
Diegan Indians at Mesa Grande on All Souls' 
Night. Whatever advantages in speed, avoid- 
ance of your own dust, and indescribable sense 
of superiority may attend the tourist who sees 
California from the automobile, there still re- 
main some otherwise unattainable pleasures 
attached to the more plebeian carriage or camp- 
ing wagon. The wayside trees and flowers, 
one's fellow-wayfarers afoot and astride, and 
the more leisurely appreciation of the local 
color reward the leisurely travellers. Spring- 
days in a carriage between Los Angeles and San 
Diego, with visits to the Missions at Capistrano 
and San Luis Rey, and to the home of Ramona, 
seem more attractive than fleeting visions from 
the speeding motor. 

Many practical suggestions for travellers 
who desire with comfort and safety to see 
something of California's wilder side will be 
found in this book, as well as readable ac- 
counts of ways and means of camp cooking, of 
bungalow life, and of making a living in the 
land of sunshine. The volume will be a helpful 
one to many inquirers, and a guide and inspira- 
tion for a wider appreciation and enjoyment of 
nature in California.

NATURAL, THEOLOGY WITHOUT THEISTIC 
IMPLICATIONS.* 



In the days of my academic and intellectually 
irresponsible youth, a favorite diversion in the 
metaphysical way was to speculate about the con- 
sequences of turning the orthodox Darwinian 
evolution formula end for end. According to 
this formula, progressive evolution of living 
things has been accomplished by the continued 
natural selection of the individuals best adapted 
to the environment in which they found them- 
selves. The fact that living things are to a 
high degree adapted to the circumstances in 
which they live is evident. The classic simile 
of biological literature is to the effect that the 
organism is adapted to the environment as the 
key is to the lock. But what if one looks at 
the whole matter the other way about? Is 
there not quite as much justification, so far as 
the objective facts of nature are concerned, for 
one to say that the environment is adapted to 
the organism, as there is for him to make the 
converse proposition? It is as necessary for 
the lock to fit the key as for the key to fit the 
lock. But while natural selection is, formally 
at least, a most efficient craftsman in shaping 
the living key to the environmental lock, it is 
by no means so clear that it could have effected 
the nice adjustment of the lock itself. In fact 
the principle of natural selection, in any form 
as yet conceived, or any other mechanistic 
hypothesis, utterly fails before such a colossal 
explanatory task. Which consideration com- 
pletes the creation of a very choice and baffling 
metaphysical morsel for the delectation of one's 
fellow graduate students. 

It is by no means to be supposed that so 
splendid an argument ad majorem gloriam Dei 
as that outlined would have been overlooked by 
the exponents of natural theology. It was 
not. Whewell and Prout, in their Bridge water 
Treatises, loaded some of their heaviest artil- 
lery with precisely this brand of philosophical 
powder. Since the Bridgewater Treatises are 
no longer classified by the librarians as "pop- 
ular" fiction, it is perhaps worth a little space 
to show how Prout, for example, used the argu- 
ment in his "Chemistry Meteorology and the 
Function of Digestion Considered with Refer- 
ence to Natural Theology." He says: 

" For instance, the hydrogen in water, and the chlorine 
and sodium in common salt, not being, in their simple 
state, required in the economy of nature; the properties

the Biological Significance of the Properties of Matter. By

of these elements have not been made compatible with 
organic existence; and the whole attention (if such a 
term may be applied to the operations of the Deity), 
has been directed to the properties of the compounds, 
water, and salt. Thus, on the one hand, where required, 
we have the most striking adaptation of property ; while 
on the other, where not required, this adaptation of 
property has not been attended to: nor is this true of 
water and salt only, but of almost every other compound 
in nature. Nay, what is more, the incongruities of the 
whole system have, with the most consummate skill, 
been thrown, as it were, among those properties not re- 
quired. Hence, the arrangements of nature viewed in 
this light, not only exhibit novel evidences, but some of 
the most striking evidences of design, which we possess." 

In the three-quarters of a century and more 
which has passed since the day of the Earl of 
Bridgewater's piously intended bequest there 
has been no systematic attempt at an examina- 
tion of the specific fitness of the basic elements 
of the environment for the requirements of 
organic life. To this problem Dr. Lawrence J. 
Henderson has devoted a number of years of 
thought and research, with results now set forth 
in a volume entitled "The Fitness of the 
Environment." The result is in many ways a 
remarkable one. It is conclusively shown that 
for living things constituted as are the only 
living things we know about, it would be impos- 
sible, with the physical agencies and chemical 
compounds now known, to construct an envi- 
ronment in fundamental respects better adapted 
to the needs of organisms than is the environ- 
ment which exists on this earth. 

For the sake of clearness of thinking and to 
keep the whole inquiry within reasonable bounds, 
the author makes certain initial limitations of 
the problem. A keen analysis reduces the most 
fundamental and essential characteristics of life 
to three, namely, complexity, regulation, and 
metabolism. The most essential features of the 
environment which is to be capable of support- 
ing mechanisms with these three characteristics 
are the presence of water and carbonic acid. 

" Obviously it is in the physical and chemical attrir 
butes of these two compounds and their constituent 
elements that we find very many of the conditions which 
make life possible upon the earth. They are material, 
provided and mobilized automatically, out of which liv- 
ing things undoubtedly can be formed. Moreover, if 
we limit our study to the physico-chemical properties 
of water and carbonic acid, and to the compounds of 
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, we shall greatly simplify 
our problem." 

The bulk of the volume is taken up with a 
thorough examination of the known physico- 
chemical properties of water, carbonic acid, and 
organic compounds. An immense mass of data 
is critically digested. The physical and chem- 
ical properties taken into consideration include 



112

[ A ugust 1 G 



nearly all those known to be of biological im- 
portance, or which appear to be related to 
complexity, regulation, and metabolism. The 
collection and treatment of this evidence can 
only be regarded as a masterly contribution to 
scientific synthesis. It firmly establishes the 
following conclusions : 

" There are no ether compounds which share more 
than a small part of the qualities of fitness of water 
and carbonic acid ; no other elements which share those 
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. None of the char- 
acteristics of these substances is known to be unfit, or 
seriously inferior to the same characteristic in any 
other substance. Therefore the fitness of the environ- 
ment is both real and unique." 

The author goes on to say : 

" In drawing this final conclusion I mean to assert 
the following propositions : 

" I. The fitness of the environment is one part of a 
reciprocal relationship of which the fitness of the organ- 
ism is the other. This relationship is completely and 
perfectly reciprocal; the one fitness is not less important 
than the other, nor less invariably a constituent of a 
particular case of biological fitness; it is not less fre- 
quently evident in the characteristics of water, carbonic 
acid, and the compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen than is fitness from adaptation in the charac- 
teristics of the organism. 

" II. The fitness of the environment results from 
characteristics which constitute a series of maxima 
unique or nearly unique properties of water, carbonic 
acid, the compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
and the ocean so numerous, so varied, so nearly com- 
plete among all things which are concerned in the 
problem that together they form certainly the greatest 
possible fitness. No other environment consisting of 
primary constituents made up of other known elements, 
or lacking water and carbonic acid, could possess a like 
number of fit characteristics or such highly fit charac- 
teristics, or in any manner such great fitness to promote 
complexity, durability, and active metabolism in the 
organic mechanism which we call life." 

At this point the book as a contribution to 
natural science comes to an end. A final 
chapter is devoted to a consideration of the 
philosophical consequences of the scientific dem- 
onstration of the earlier pages. While this is 
very well done, it seems to the reviewer, at least, 
to fall short, in compelling logical force, of the 
purely scientific part of the work. Dr. Hen- 
derson shows clearly enough that existing 
science is totally incapable of giving any satis- 
factory mechanistic explanation of the mutual 
fitness of the environment and the organism. 
He considers it well in the present state of 
knowledge, however, not to affirm finally the 
impossibility of such an explanation. In the 
meantime he suggests a devitalized teleology in 
the form of a purposive " tendency working 
steadily through the whole process of evolution," 
as at least conceivable, " however small its 



bearing upon science, provided, like time itself, 
it be a perfectly independent variable, making 
up, therefore, with time the constant environ- 
ment, so to speak, of the evolutionary process." 
This " tendency " is not something which can 
be weighed or measured, but is an original 
property of matter and energy, " assuredly not 
by chance, which organizes the universe in space 
and time." 

Lack of space forbids further discussion of 
a brilliantly written and altogether notable 
book. " The Fitness of the Environment," in 
respect of the chapters before the last, is a 
logical sequel to the " Origin of Species." As 
an intellectual achievement, it invites and cred- 
itably sustains comparison with that milestone 
marking the progress of human knowledge.

SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'S WORKS.* 



Late in 1572 Hubert Languet,then fifty-four, 
and Sir Philip Sidney, then almost eighteen, 
met at Frankfort; and from 1573 to 1580, with 
several interruptions, exchanged Latin letters 
about matters personal and contemporary. 
There is much amenity in the relation partly 
that of friend to friend, partly that of pupil to 
teacher between the English youth and the 
aging French humanist and diplomat; much 
international comity; much learned and labori- 
ous fooling. And across the pages of their cor- 
respondence move, not vividly, but like shadows, 
many great names and events: the St. Barthol- 
omew and the Battle of Lepanto ; Drake's and 
Frobisher's voyages ; Queen Elizabeth (" to us a 
Meleager's brand : when it perishes, farewell to 
all our quietness"); Don John of Austria, the 
Prince of Orange, and the Elector of Saxony ; 
the Polish Succession and the "French Mar- 
riage"; Requesens, the younger Egmont, and 
the Duke of Parma ; Tintoretto and Paul Ver- 
onese; De Thou, Du Plessis-Mornay, Sturm; 
Baron Slavata, who borrowed money of Sidney, 
and was reserved by fate to be "defenestrated" 
at Prague forty-two years later and still to sur- 
vive; the Grand Turk, his Janizaries, and the 
Muscovite; marchings and countermarchings

across the face of Europe ; alarums and excur- 
sions; "and what the Swede intend, and what 
the French." 

Not among the great correspondences of 
literature, these letters are nevertheless full of 
interest when placed in their historical setting. 
Just here appears a defect of Mr. Bradley's 
admirable edition. Reprinting, as it does, the 
text of Steuart A. Pears's translation (London : 
Pickering, 1845), it might well have reprinted 
also Pears's historical notes. These, which add 
greatly to the value of his version, might have 
been placed at the end of the present volume, so 
as not to spoil the page. Mr. Bradley's Intro- 
duction does not wholly supply their place. In 
all that relates to text and typography, however, 
the present edition compares favorably with the 
old. The editor has numbered the letters, and 
has in many places quietly improved Pears's 
punctuation, spelling, grammar, and sentence- 
structure. The type-page, though somewhat 
attenuated, and though its rubrication will not 
appeal to all, is open and clear, and scarcely 
inferior to that of A Idi discipulus anglus. 

The last of Sidney's letters is dated 1578; 
those he wrote between that year and 1580 are 
lost. It happens that during these years, in all 
probability, he composed the " Arcadia," which 
circulated actively in MS. until 1590, when the 
first edition (quarto) was printed. This first 
edition it is that M. Feuillerat has chosen to 
reprint; and, he says (Prefatory Note), his 
"choice has proved simple enough." So it 
would appear ; and yet there are reasons why a 
different choice would have been preferable. 
These reasons are bound up so closely with 
the evolution of the several versions of the 
"Arcadia," that their full force can be under- 
stood only by the reader who will take the pains 
to inform himself fully about this evolution*; 
still, they can be indicated briefly here. 

There are now extant three distinct versions 
of the "Arcadia." The first is what Sidney 
wrote originally, during or before 1580 a 
finished story in five books. This original or 
" Old Arcadia" has never been printed entire. 
The second version is an incomplete revision 
of the "Old Arcadia," carried rather less than 
halfway to the end. It was printed in 1590 
(quarto), and is now textually corrected and 
reprinted by M. Feuillerat. The third version, 
printed 1593, is composed of the revised ver-

sion as far as that goes, together with Books 
III., IV., and V. of the "Old Arcadia," so 
joined to the revised version as to piece out the 
story, though not without a gap between, ,^-j 

1. The original or " Old Arcadia," as 
written during or before 1580, was permitted 
by Sidney to remain in active circulation in 
MS. for five years, more or less, until his death 
in 1586. It was not at any time withdrawn 
or suppressed ; nor was it even superseded by 
the incomplete revision printed in 1590 and 
now reprinted ; for this version covers only a 
part of the story which the " Old Arcadia " 
told entire. So the " Old Arcadia " remains 
an integral part of Sidney's works, and as such . 
demands a place in any edition that professes 
to be complete. 

2. In intrinsic literary merit, the " Old 
Arcadia " holds its own with the unfinished 
revision. It is a complete romance, in five 
books, with beginning, middle, and end, quite 
simple in structure, and agreeable to read. The 
quarto of 1590 now reprinted is a partial recen- 
sion, or rather an unfinished attempt at an 
entirely new version, of the " Old Arcadia," 
which Sidney was able to carry only to a point 
somewhere in the third book. It thus lacks 
both middle and end ; moreover, it is inter- 
rupted by many distracting episodes, is exces- 
sively inverted and complex in structure, and 
can hardly be read without considerable diffi- 
culty. 

3. The Quarto of 1590 is already accessible 
in photographic facsimile (ed. H. Oskar Sommer, 
London, 1891), not to mention the numerous 
old editions still current, and a recent edition 
by E. A. Baker (London, 1907), all of which 
embody the text of the quarto substantially, as 
part of the composite version (see below) . The 
" Old Arcadia " exists in MSS. no less than 
five of which three are in England and two 
in the United States. It could scarcely have 
been difficult for a scholar of M. Feuillerat's 
standing to get permission to make a text by 
the collation of the best of these MSS. It does 
not appear that he has tried. 

4. In 1593 appeared the third or composite 
version above mentioned, consisting of the 
revised portion already printed in 1590, and 
the last three books of the " Old Arcadia," 
together with such minor changes in the text, 
and such transitions, as were needed to link the 
two versions together. The 1593 edition has 
often been reprinted, and is the current form 
of the romance. Now M. Feuillerat promises 



114 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



to print in his next volume " that part of the 
original Arcadia [viz. Books III., IV., and V.] 
which was added in 1593. Thus, the incon- 
gruity of blending two incompatible forms has 
been avoided without omitting what is, after 
all, an interesting part of Sir Philip Sidney's 
works." This argument would require, even 
more insistently, the reprinting of Books I. and 
II. of the " Old Arcadia," together with Books 
III., IV., and V., that is, the reprinting of 
the " Old Arcadia " entire. 

5. There are in Elizabethan literature 
many allusions to the " Old Arcadia," and 
several direct borrowings from it. All these 
will remain unintelligible to the vast majority 
of readers and scholars until the " Old Arca- 
dia " as a whole is accessible in print. Fur- 
thermore, the differences in structure between 
the Old and the revised " Arcadia " are im- 
portant in the evolution of the English novel. 
The chief structural qualities of the revised 
version that are not possessed by the " Old 
Arcadia " are amplitude, complexity, and chro- 
nological inversion. Now the revised " Arca- 
dia," handed on in the composite version of 
1593, is the only piece of Elizabethan fiction 
whose influence survives into the eighteenth 
century ; it presides at the birth of the novel ; 
and may well have endowed the novel with pre- 
cisely these structural qualities. Apart, there- 
fore, from our intrinsic interest in having before 
us for comparison an earlier and a later version 
of the " Arcadia," the reprinting of the first ver- 
sion is thus required by the claims of literary 
history. 

What the present editor ought to have done 
was to print in his first volume the " Old 
Arcadia," from the MSS.; to print, in his sec- 
ond volume, the revised version of 1590 ; and 
to add thereto, by way of textual variants, the 
changes and the transitions made by the com- 
posite edition of 1593. It is to be hoped that 
before the issue of his next volume he may see 
his way clear to putting into it the material 
which for so many reasons ought to have gone 
into his first. SAMUEL LEE WOLFF. 



FROM a literary point of view, at least, the " book of 
the season " this year will undoubtedly be the two- 
volume collection of Charles Eliot Norton's Letters, 
which Houghton Mifflin Co. will publish. The selections 
from this correspondence already printed in " Scribner's 
Magazine " have given some indication of the wealth 
that awaits us in the complete work. The same 
publishers also announce " Some Letters of William 
Vaughn Moody," edited by Mr. Daniel G. Mason, which 
also promises a feast of good things. 



HOPES AND PROPHESIES FOIt 
AMERICAN LIFE.* 



No better augury for the slow and peaceful de- 
velopment of humankind, especially in this country, 
can well be imagined than the armful of books, 
representing every shade of political opinion, which 
here indicates the tendencies of the time. There is 
a spokesman in this group for every class in our 
wide national community; and all express them- 
selves with a certain dispassion, fervent though 
some of the statements may be, which is of the 
essence of a self-governing and progressive people. 

It may be worth while to speak here, since none 
of the books themselves touch upon this phase of 
our political history, of the high idealism which has 
characterized all our national partisan utterances, 
based as American ideas must be upon the Decla- 
ration of Independence and its self-evident truths. 
So based, no party has identified itself with a single 
economic class without inviting its own destruction, 
and has only been able to do so covertly and in 
antagonism to its professed principles. All are na- 
tional, in the sense of making a nation-wide appeal 
to men in every situation in life; none is merely 
economic, with the exception of the Socialistic Party, 
which has not yet been fairly tested by success. Nor, 
with this exception, has every party failed to include 
within its ranks men of every shade of economic 
opinion there is no party of employers, or of 
employees, none of clerks and another of laborers, 
but in each and all a fusion which has permitted 
the discussion of nearly all economic questions freed 
from the acrimony of partisanship. The harm that 
can be done by the identification of economic and 
partisan interests is fully exemplified in the tariff, 
which from the beginning has been a prolific cause 
of ruin to every party that has used it for merely 
partisan purposes. 

Every one of these books reflects this national 
attitude. In each case the author shows himself 
possessed of a wider outlook upon national affairs 
than any thorough-going partisan is likely to obtain. 
Whatever his prepossessions, his statements are those 
of the judge speaking after due weighing of the 
evidence, rather than of the advocate seeking a fav- 
orable decision. Perhaps this shows most clearly in 
Mr. Walter Lippmann's " A Preface to Politics," the 
work of a socialistic leader and writer who is, never- 
theless, more interested in providing an ideal which 
all may work toward than a creed which must be

professed as an essential of salvation. He is fully 
aware that the present period is revolutionary ; and 
he is equally satisfied that it is readily responsive 
to idealism. What he seeks is to present a vision, 
something higher and nobler than the evils he sees 
about us clamoring for remedy; and his text is, 
"A God wilt thou create for thyself out of thy 
seven devils." More than most, Mr. Lippmann dis- 
believes in the old puritan attitude that the world 
finds betterment through the turning of personal 
sins into statutory crimes a point of view partic- 
ularly welcome now that the injection of large 
masses of women-voters into our body politic has 
given unnecessary encouragement to the opposing 
party. He is for construction, for positive incentives 
to right conduct, for the conversion of the energies 
which are turned toward destruction into forces 
which make for righteousness, and his remarks 
upon the tabu of merely prohibitive legislation are 
as sound as they are shrewd. 

Dr. Howerth, who holds the chair of sociology in 
the University of California, has made a suggestive 
and readable book from a series of public addresses 
delivered at various times and places during recent 
years. Its first value, perhaps, lies in the fact that 
it is the work of a university professor who is far 
more interested in seeing the world bettered than in 
having it maintained as it is. Dr. Howerth, neither 
plutocrat nor socialist, holds no brief for anything 
except the ideals which his reading and experience 
have shown him to be practical; and he is at one 
with Mr. Lippmann in seeking to moralize existing 
forces, many of which are anti-social through self- 
seeking. He particularizes in regard to these, leading 
the reader through discussions of the social problem 
and the various solutions proposed for it, including 
the existing competitive system, on to the individual 
problem of getting a living, the problem of our cities, 
and the effect of education upon labor, until he 
reaches a statement of the social ideal, with con- 
siderations of a wider patriotism and a broader 
religious outlook. Realizing, as more ardent parti- 
sans do not, that progress is along the diagonal of 
the opposing forces of individualism and collectivism, 
he finds both the line of least resistance and of the 
highest human efficiency in voluntary cooperation, 
which is also the goal of both the philosophic anar- 
chist and the militant socialist. The nation has 
suffered in the past from lack of radical sentiment 
among its college youth, most of whom are graduated 
with the conservative views of elderly bank presi- 
dents; and such open-mindedness as this book pro- 
claims should make a welcome addition to every 
curriculum certainly in every institution of learn- 
ing which is concerned as much with things-as-they- 
might-be as with things-as-they-are. A single sentence 
from the book, properly understood, states the whole 
matter: "We must not lose sight of the fact that 
the object of Capital is profits ; the object of Labor 
is life." 

" The New Morality " of Mr. Isaacson wanders 
far from the beaten track in offering as a solution 



for most of our existing evils a definite remedy, 
neither individualistic nor socialistic, but Utopian 
however much the author disclaims the Utopian in- 
tention. He would separate civilized mankind into 
two sharply defined classes. One, to which repro- 
duction of the species shall be solely confided, is to 
be a yeoman body, bringing forth not only the chil- 
dren of mankind but its food products in their raw 
state. Experience teaches, the writer urges, that 
it is among favorable yeoman conditions that the 
healthiest children are born and reared, and he re- 
gards it as a waste of human effort that any but 
those best fitted for it should bear children at all, 
seeing no possibility of meeting the Malthusian 
objections and complying with the demands of evo- 
lutionary eugenics without such a delimitation of 
effort. The rest of the race will be self-condemned 
to sterility, and will engage in part in the cruder 
forms of agriculture, but chiefly in commerce and 
manufacturing, mining and transportation. These 
will be city-dwellers for the most part ; and it did 
not need the author's eloquence to demonstrate the 
advantages of a city in which no children are per- 
mitted to enter except as visitors, and then only 
occasionally and under restrictions. Mr. Isaacson 
meets the woman problem and solves it in a manner 
which will probably satisfy others more than the 
women, his prime concern being the elimination of 
a leisure class among them, including the childless 
woman, whether married or unmarried, who has 
commerce with men ; making, however, full allow- 
ance for the declared and self-sustaining spinster. 
So stated, it will be seen that some primary instincts 
of mankind will have to be widely diverted from 
their present status, and the impossibility of doing 
so fundamental a task with any thoroughness con- 
stitutes the manifest objection to his plan. But it 
would be most unfair to end with such a statement ; 
the book is thoughtful and well-considered, well 
worked out, even to the diagrams which support the 
author's position, and provocative of thought through 
the very novelty of its point of view. 

The Rev. Dr. Strong's "Our World" is a broad- 
ening of a previous work, "Our Country," and is 
itself to be followed by another work still broader 
in its scope. It is, of all the books here under con- 
sideration, the only one with what may be termed 
an orthodox bias ; its author believes that the Chris- 
tian religion as professed by the evangelical churches 
contains the solution of the difficulties of the world, 
individual and social. Existing troubles are referred 
to this touchstone, with the result that, as the most 
radical reformers are aware, nothing can bear such 
possibilities for thorough-going change as the prac- 
tice of the precepts of Jesus. The book is no mere 
tract, however, but an honest and manly reckoning 
with the world as it is, with all the possibilities that 
science is opening out to humanity. It states in 
terms with which few will disagree a new world- 
tendency, a new world-industry, a new world-peace, 
and a new world-ideal. It follows these with an 
acute and sympathetic discussion of the new world- 



116

problems in industry, wealth, race, the individual 
and society, lawlessness and legislation, and the 
new problem of the city. In regard to this last, Dr. 
Strong takes an unusual position in holding that all 
attempts to return men to the land are worse than 
futile, that the cities are here and have grown at 
the expense of the country everywhere and will so 
continue to grow, and that we might better face the 
fact than attempt to delude ourselves with a contrary 
belief. He does not in the least take into account 
the enormous artificial stimulus given city growth 
through railway abuses and tariff pabulum in recent 
years, and that these causes for the relative loss of 
rural population are already in the way of being 
remedied; nor does he consider the waste which 
permits good immigrant farmers to become poor 
city operatives through lack of intelligent direction, 
which is also remediable wholly or partially. But 
by way of compensation for this he plainly tells us 
that "the problem of the city is nothing less than 
the problem of civilization, the problem of building 
in the earth the New Jerusalem." Here he is in 
agreement with the best thought of the age. How 
this problem is to be solved is reserved for consid- 
eration in another volume. 

"Crowds," Mr. Gerald Stanley Lee's latest book 
of practical idealism, is the most striking volume of 
our group. It is much more strikingly written, and 
both arrests and holds the attention better. And 
its method is so simple that it is difficult to disagree 
with it, no matter where it leads. Briefly stated, 
Mr. Lee delights in showing us just how far the 
most open-minded and generous-souled men among 
us have actually (not theoretically) gone toward 
solving the problems of every-day living, following 
this by the suggestion that we move up beside them 
and enjoy the feeling of actual, veritable, demon- 
strable progress. It is difficult to deny the charm 
of such an invitation, nor can there be any desire to 
deny it. We are not dealing with dreamers except 
those that have made their dreams come true, and 
the temptation is necessarily strong to go to work 
to prove that our dreams are just as good as those 
of these other men. Where others hold that man- 
kind is moving in a circle, and that it is impossible 
to strike a tangent until this, that, or the other has 
been done, Mr. Lee points out that this, that, and the 
other has been done and is doing, and persuades us 
into the procession. He believes in saying "Do!" 
and not "Don't!" He points out that nearly all 
our evils come from lack of vision, and he musters 
the visions that have become realities to prove his 
case. He seems to look upon ignorance of existing 
facts as the prime cause of lack of advance and retro- 
gression which is obvious enough ; but he demon- 
strates that ignorance is curable by showing how 
much has been cured already by those who have 
knowledge. In one aspect the book is a catalogue 
of the exhilarations of civilization as it is, and its 
perusal leaves the reader almost as much exhilarated 
with practicalities as the writer was when he wrote 
it or as other reformers are by visions unrealized. 



More than any other writer whose books are read, 
Mr. Lee seems to be absolutely convinced that 
democracy is never a process of levelling down but 
of raising up, and he has the faith of a Jefferson in 
human perfectibility. As the cover of the volume 
proclaims, it is "a book for the individual," but for 
the individual as the one essential component of all 
" Crowds." It is cordially recommended to every 
reader who is interested in the world's getting for- 
ward, chiefly as a further incentive for him to "go 
forwarder." 

When it is recalled that this group of varied and 
various works are written by Americans for Ameri- 
cans, that they are the appeals of men of vision to 
the nation which had the highest vision possible to 
humanity granted it at the moment of its birth, that 
not one of them betrays a sign of self-seeking or per- 
sonal exploitation or desire to profit by the mistakes 
of mankind except for mankind's future betterment, 
that they represent the work of men of families long 
in the country and of families entering the country 
only yesterday, that they are free from almost every 
bewildering bias and misconception that has clouded 
the eyes of earlier generations, and that their single 
and universal message is of material betterment 
solely as a means for spiritual enlightenment, the 
faintest-hearted among us should take courage for 
the long fight and go forth newly armed and armored 
to gain the victory. WALLACE RICE. 



BKIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Prehittoric Dr ' Rob 61 ^ Munro's bulky volume, 

lake-dwellings "Palaeolithic Man and Terramara 
in Europe. Settlements in Europe" (Macmil- 

lan), constituting the latest contribution of an inde- 
fatigable worker to his favorite field, is composed of 
the Munro Lectures in Anthropology and Prehistoric 
Archaeology, delivered during February and March, 
1912, in connection with the University of Edin- 
burgh. They form the first course given after the 
foundation of the Lectureship, which appears to be 
permanently endowed. It is now more than thirty 
years since Dr. Munro published his first great 
work, "Ancient Scottish Lake-dwellings or Cran- 
nogs." At rather regular intervals since then, he 
has made other and various important contributions 
to archaeological science. Only the special student 
realizes what significant advances have recently been 
made in this field of study. Within ten years, one 
may say that the known number of skulls and other 
skeletal remains of ancient man has been doubled, 
and the more recent finds have been of unquestion- 
able authenticity and extraordinary interest; so of 
relics of ancient culture, no more startling and 
illuminating discoveries have ever been made than 
those of the past fifteen years. So rapidly have 
discoveries crowded upon one another that even the 
specialist keeps pace with them only by diligence 
and with difficulty. The ordinary reader has had 
no means of knowing of this wealth of new material

save through the misleading cursory references in 
occasional sensational newspapers. Dr. Munro has 
then done a very real service in his new book. Upon 
the two special and quite separate topics which he 
has chosen to discuss, he gives us the latest discov- 
eries, facts, and theories. Thus, in regard to palae- 
olithic man, he briefly describes and states the facts 
concerning all those recently discovered remains 
which have caused such a stir in the world of science ; 
to give completeness, he of course restates the facts 
regarding the earlier finds the Neanderthal skull, 
the Spy remains, the Naulette jawbone but his 
special service is in informing us of the Mousterien 
finds so lately made by Otto Hauser, the remarkable 
skeleton of Chapelle-aux-Saints, and wonderful jaw- 
bone from Mauer ; he summarizes all the older infor- 
mation regarding the scratched designs on bone and 
horn from Magdalenien caves, but he also presents 
to us the even more interesting ivory and bone sculp- 
tures which Piette found in cave deposits of yet 
older age. He presents an admirable summary of 
the astonishing incised and painted representations 
of animals upon the walls of Pyrenean caverns, and 
the remarkable frieze of sculptured horses and other 
animals in the rock-shelter of Cap-Blanc. In a fine 
chapter upon the so-called hiatus between Palaeolithic 
and Neolithic cultures of Europe, he brings together 
a mass of interesting and recent evidence to prove 
that there is no actual gap. The second part of the 
work deals with Italian terramares and related struc- 
tures in other countries. Dr. Munro's specialty has 
been lake- dwellings, terramares, crannogs, and kin- 
dred forms. In connection with this part of his book 
he presents a bibliography of Italian literature upon 
the subject, extending from 1822 to 1911 and 
including 212 items. The Italian terramares have 
been a considerable problem; they were somewhat 
like the lake-dwelling villages of Switzerland, but 
their pile-supported huts were over low-lands or 
swamps and not over open lakes, and they were sur- 
rounded by an artificial moat and dike. Dr. Munro 
sketches the history of study of the terramares, 
describes them, investigates their purpose and the 
culture which they represent, and works out their 
relation to lake-dwellings all this in Italy ; he then 
traces the occurrence of similar or analogous con- 
structions elsewhere, and deals with the question of 
origins. One readily sees that the book is at once 
interesting and important. In fact, there has been 
no equally important contribution to European pre- 
historic archaeology, in English, for years. 

Taken as a whole, Mr. Robert W. 
KSSSSSi Garden's "Michelangelo: A Record 

of his Life as Told in his Own Let- 
ters and Papers" (Houghton) is a monotonous re- 
cital of petty tribulations. Obviously Michelangelo's 
constant preoccupation with three other arts largely 
accounts for the fact that his deepest self could find 
but scant expression through the written word. In- 
frequently does he pen a sentence without a practical 
and commonplace motive behind it. Such motives, 



unfortunately, were supplied in exceptional abun- 
dance by the pressure of everyday anxieties. These 
arose on the one hand from the needs of his father's 
family, to whose precarious welfare he devoted a 
lifetime ; and, on the other hand, from the capricious 
desires of his high patrons. If a Renaissance pope 
or cardinal were not demanding an impossible num- 
ber of statues " more beautiful and better wrought 
and finished than any modern figures to be found 
in Rome to-day" (page 17), the payment for which 
was often doubtful, why then a heedless brother 
or nephew was in need of aid, or a word-thrashing. 
By the time the reader reaches page 256, he is ready 
to be surprised at discovering what seems, from its 
opening, a spontaneous letter of friendship to an old 
Florentine crony but which, as too soon appears, 
was actuated primarily by a desire that the recipient 
should keep a critical eye on the mistrustful artist's 
young nephew. Again, in reply to an importunate 
admirer, Michelangelo gives utterance to his feelings 
on the principles of sculpture and painting; but he 
brings the letter to a hasty close, pleading lack of 
time and energy. In short, those various aspects 
of an artist's inner life which the reader expects to 
find recorded in a collection of his letters are scarcely 
represented. So that the work is actually, notwith- 
standing its promising title, very narrow in scope, 
and would sadly mislead the unprepared reader. On 
the other hand, one who is well acquainted with the 
great artist's biography and with his works, may be 
willing to wade through the book for the sake of 
occasional passages of vital interest otherwise inac- 
cessible outside of the archives: passages redolent 
of the master's grim humor, large generosity, and 
rugged force of intellect and emotion, as well as of 
less attractive but quite characteristic qualities. Be- 
tween the lines, too, such a reader can find constantly 
a poignant pathos, especially toward the close of the 
long story when, still full of high plans for art and 
beset as ever with tribulations, the old man has to 
confess that " I have reached the twenty-fourth hour 
of my day, and no project arises in my brain which 
hath not the figure of Death graven upon it." 

Mr Hewlett ^ r ' Maurice Hewlett sees fairies. 
and the He encountered his first an elfin 

fairv-folk. foy ^fa marvellously bright, peering 

eyes and an inhuman trick of strangling rabbits 
when he was himself a shy, rather elfin boy of 
twelve, walking alone through twilit autumn woods. 
He was not much frightened. Since then his fairies 
have usually been nymphs, dryads, oreads, 
dainty, dancing, joyous shapes, of both sexes but of 
an appeal essentially feminine. He has had count- 
less adventures with fairy folk ; at times he has 
even lived " in a state of momentary expectation of 
apparitions." Accounts of some of these and of a 
few well authenticated experiences of other people 
in the " delightful land of Fairy " form the main 
thread of Mr. Hewlett's recent book, " The Lore of 
Proserpine" (Scribner). The incidents are not 
told as marvels, since they happened, in the view of

THE DIAL

the narrator, in due course of nature ; and there is 
no effort to convert skeptics to a belief in airy 
spirits. Mr. Hewlett's interest in fairy lore is not 
controversial. Rather it is aesthetic spiritual and 
sensuous by turns. These things happen to him ; 
in that sense assuredly they are true ; and their 
real interest, he feels, lies in their being genuine 
human experiences with creatures of another order 
of life creatures of superhuman loveliness, capable 
of fierce joy, impulsive, active, unmoral, yielding 
obedience to no known law but that of being. Inci- 
dentally to his fairy experiences, Mr. Hewlett gives 
inviting glimpses of his boyhood, and he theorizes 
entertainingly about the duality of human nature 
that brings poetry, high adventure, romance, and 
vision into the drab commercial prose of life. Scorn- 
fully does he demolish the hypothesis of those who 
insist on judging others by themselves or regarding 
humanity as essentially uniform, and denying all 
realities which they have not experienced. The 
chapter on " Windows " puts one on the lookout 
for odd vagaries in one's fellows, awakens sym- 
pathy with vagrant, inexplicable impulses, with odd 
turns of thought and unexpected depths of feeling. 
There is something of fairy in many humans, accor- 
ding to Mr. Hewlett ; and the discovery of these 
wild, shy sprites and the luring of them into the 
open of intercourse will be, for most, perhaps, of 
Mr. Hewlett's readers, the finest flower of his ini- 
tiation of them into the lore of the fairy kingdom. 

Some years ago Mr. Frank Arthur 
M mby developed a plan to illustrate 
certain phases of Tudor history by 
the use of contemporary letters. He began to carry 
out his plan by publishing a volume on "The Girlhood 
of Queen Elizabeth "; this has recently been followed 
by another on "The Youth of Henry VIII." (Hough- 
ton) ; and Mr. Mumby hopes to continue the series 
until the entire history of England is illustrated in 
this way. The letters published are taken chiefly 
from the Calendars of State Papers (English) ; but 
various other collections, both English and French, 
have also been used. Of editorial comment there is 
very little, only what is necessary to bridge the 
gap between the successive documents. As not all 
the documents are accessible elsewhere in printed or 
translated form, the work may prove of some value 
to the historical student; but the general reader is 
seldom attracted to documentary materials in undi- 
gested form. The account begins with Henry's 
birth in 1491, and closes with the secret marriage of 
his sister Mary to Charles Brandon in 1515. The 
larger part of the work is devoted to diplomatic 
intrigues of which international relations were full 
in that age, and to domestic matters, especially mat- 
rimonial negotiations and plans ; of the new English 
life in commeice and industry very little is said. 
Mr. Mumby 's work has no discernible point of view, 
and shows no bias : the author does not attempt " to 
pass judgment on controverted topics" but tries "to 
allow each side to state its case in its own words." 



His opinion is, however, rather favorable to the young 
Henry : he was " spoiled a little, perhaps, by flattery, 
but even when due allowance is made for exaggera- 
tion, a splendid figure of a man . . . ." The work 
contains eight good portraits, all but one of which 
are of members of the Tudor family. 

further ^ third volume of Dr. Sven Hedin's 

researches "Trans-Himalaya: Discoveries and 

in Tibet. Adventures in Tibet" (Macmillan) 

continues his detailed and illuminating account of 
his adventures among the nomads and pundits of 
the high plateaus about the sources of the Indus, in 
the highlands of Western Tibet, and the Sutlej valley. 
These are regions some of which have never been 
trodden before by the foot of any white man, and 
the author takes this occasion to defend his claims 
to discovery which have been questioned by some 
on the basis of previously published maps. An ex- 
tensive review of these earlier publications and an 
exhaustive examination into their sources afford the 
occasion for a review of previous explorations and 
explorers of this remote part of the world, as well 
as an opportunity for a vigorous and seemingly 
successful defense. The ancient Aryans enveloped 
this world of impenetrable mountains in a tissue of 
legends and lyrics. Through this fabric of myths 
there runs a slender thread of geographic fact, coiled 
and twisted by each succeeding narrator, even to 
the present. Dr. Hedin has at last explored and 
thoroughly mapped the mystic Lake Manasarowar 
in spite of treaty provisions of the Great Powers, 
the prohibitions of the Lama and his subordinates, 
and the great physical obstacles of all but impassable 
barrier mountains, great elevation, the risks of fail- 
ing food supply, and the dangers of attack by nomad 
robbers. The author reiterates his thesis of the 
great similarities of form between Catholicism and 
Tibetan Lamaism, quotes extensively from other 
authorities in defence of his view, and seems to have 
quite demolished the ultra-montane objectors. Illus- 
trations from photographs and the author's facile 
pencil abound, and a good map and an ample index 
maintain the high order of bookmaking established 
in the first two volumes of this, the fullest account 
of Tibet yet published. 

Measuring Dr - Frederick Adams Woods, the 
the influence author of "Mental and Moral Her- 
of monarch*. edity in Royalty," has carried the 
thought of this book through to a logical conclusion 
in his new volume, "The Influence of Monarchs : 
Steps in a New Science of History" (Macmillan). 
The earlier work consisted in accumulating facts 
relating to royal families and those of the first 
nobility, with two ends in view: One, the ascer- 
tainment of the power of heredity over circum- 
stance; the other, the securing of material for a 
scientific study of the causes by which history 
moves. The present book is characterized as " the 
first application of the methods of historical meas- 
urement (historiometry) to the larger questions of 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



119 



national growth and decline." The method is a 
scientific one, consisting in taking a consensus of 
historians regarding the qualities of the rulers of 
fourteen European nations from the beginnings 
of the middle ages to the opening of the nineteenth 
century, and comparing this consensus with the 
progress made under these monarchs' respective 
rules. An agreement is found between the capaci- 
ties of sovereigns and actual progress in three- 
fifths of the cases, the number of correspondences 
being largely increased if incapacity and lack of 
progress or retrogression are taken into account. By 
this method England, significantly, shows little or no 
relation between the qualities of its sovereigns and 
true progress since the time of Elizabeth, indicating 
that democracy and the power of self-government 
more than offset the influence of monarchs. Gen- 
erally speaking, Dr. Woods's later work confirms 
the conclusions of the earlier, to the effect that 
heredity is a stronger governing factor than envi- 
ronment among the monarchs considered, and that 
the royal families of Europe show an unduly large 
proportion of talent and even genius when com- 
pared with all others. It is Dr. Woods's intention 
to provide a firm statistical foundation for a true 
philosophy of history, whereby correction can be 
made of the personal estimates of historians and 
deductions follow which will place the new science 
of " historiometry " upon a scientific basis, through 
something analogous to a laboratory method. The 
book is instructively interesting throughout, not the 
least curious of the reflections it induces arising 
from its democratic summoning of these centuries of 
crowned majesty before the examining board of 
science, there to receive a grading not unlike that 
given a potential freshmen class. 

More dubious Under the title of " Faith and Sug- 

gleanings ,. /-r-,,., , , ,. -p, . T-> -n \ 

in psychical gestion (Philadelphia: Peter Reilly) 
research. Mr. E. L. Ash attempts an essay in 

apologetics, common enough but reminiscent of an 
escape from danger that was " almost providen- 
tial." Mr. Ash argues that cures of illness by 
appeal to religious faith, though fairly well accounted 
for by suggestion, are almost miraculous. He pre- 
fers to believe them so, and tries to ease his logical 
conscience by bringing in a pointless tale of a young 
woman whose case was diagnosed by some as tuber- 
culous and by others as hysterical, and who after 
visions of religious import ceased to be an invalid. 
Assuming that she was really tuberculous and not 
hysterical, she had a real illness from which she 
was miraculously cured ; and the photograph of the 
room in which the visions took place is exhibited in 
circumstantial evidence. The book is a type of the 
gleanings in the field of " psychical research," in 
which the gleaner takes comfort in the view that by 
liberal concessions one may believe both in faith 
and in suggestion ; the latter as an accredited psy- 
chological process answering for the ordinary occa- 
sions ; and the former for extraordinary ones. 
Entertaining a crude view of the antagonism between 



the " materialists " and the " spiritualists," he offers 
a crude special plea for the justification of the latter 
and the discomfiture of the infidel. Similarly- 
minded readers may gain a feeble reflection of the 
satisfaction which the author enjoyed in overcoming 
by faith and suggestion his lingering doubts of the 
inadequacy of his position. 

Alaska of ^ e author of "Alaska: An Empire 
to-day and in the Making " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), 
to-morrow. Mr j j Underwood, has spent four- 
teen years in the far north and has gathered a 
fund of trustworthy information pertaining to the 
natural resources of this great territory, its govern- 
mental inadequacies, its economic problems, and its 
industrial and agricultural possibilities. The por- 
trayal is in journalistic style, and the facts are mar- 
shalled in effective and often startling array, with a 
completeness and scope that make the book a veri- 
table up-to-date encyclopaedia of things Alaskan. It 
is far more, however, than a dry recital of statistics, 
for it is full of human interest from cover to cover, 
and affords an interesting picture of life in the sea- 
ports and mining camps of this far northwest. The 
widespread impression prevails that Alaska is cold 
and barren, a land of mountains or swamps, of in- 
terest only to the transient prospector or occasional 
sportsman. A broader vision of its latent possibil- 
ities is opened here, of undeveloped fisheries, of 
wheat fields as yet untilled, of potential meat supply 
in reindeer and caribou, of copper, iron, and coal 
awaiting industrial exploitation, and of water power 
inexhaustible. The author has the conventional local 
view of the desirability of capitalistic exploitation 
and of the conservation craze. It is to be hoped 
that the book will do something towards expediting 
Congressional action which shall provide adequate 
local self-government and permit a sane and regu- 
lated development of the great resources of this 
territory, rich in food supplies and in fuel for the 
western world. 

Governmental The tenth Volume f " The Journal of 

records of the House of Burgesses of Virginia," 

Virginia. edited by Mr< H> R> Mcllwaine, the 

State Librarian, and published by the Library Board 
of the Virginia State Library, covers the seven ses- 
sions of the House of Burgesses held from 1702 to 
1712, the period being almost exactly that of 
the reign of Queen Anne. During this time three 
governors Nicholson, Nott, and Spottswood 
represented the Queen in Virginia. The capital at 
Jamestown having been destroyed by fire, the seat 
of government was removed to Williamsburg, where 
for a time the sessions were held in William and 
Mary College. The Journals here published are 
from copies in the English public record office, and 
have never before been printed. The contents throw 
light upon governmental practices in the colony 
of Virginia, the methods and extent of taxation, 
the disputes between governor and council and the 
popular house, the problem of imperial control, the 
tendency of the lower house to extend its powers at

the expense of governor and council, and colonial 
law-making. These volumes continue to present 
material of great value for the study of the devel- 
opment of English constitutional government in the 
New World, and the extension of English methods 
of local government into new fields and under con- 
ditions unknown in the mother country. The work 
of editor and printer continues to maintain the high 
standard set by the previous volumes. 

Wonders of Miss Agnes C. Laut knows America, 
the American from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of 
Southwest. Mexico, and from the Atlantic to 

the Pacific. She has wandered far and wide, with 
seeing eyes, an open mind, and a gift for extracting 
information from everyone with whom she comes in 
contact. What she has learned, from men and books, 
she has made good use of in persuading the people 
of America that they need not leave their own con- 
tinent to find romance and picturesqueness, dramatic 
episodes, stirring history, or even ancient ruins. She 
has written in the past of the exploits of French 
explorers in the north and the west; of the lives and 
adventures of fur-traders and trappers ; of the one- 
time empire of the Hudson's Bay Company; and 
what she has written has been both entertaining and 
informing. In the latest of perhaps a dozen volumes, 
she takes her readers " Through Our Unknown 
Southwest" (McBride) that wonderful region of 
mountain, desert, and forest, of mile- deep canons, 
of Spanish missions and prehistoric ruins. She 
takes us through the enchanted Mesa of Acoma, the 
Painted Desert, and the Petrified Forests ; she 
shows us the cave dwellings of neolithic man in the 
Jemez Mountains, the ancient city of Taos, and the 
Spanish mission of San Xavier at Tucson; and she 
asks, not without reason, why 120,000 Americans 
yearly go to Europe in search of the picturesque 
when their own land teems with it. She tells of a 
young American who, after he had graduated from 
Harvard, set out on a round-the-world trip in search 
of that old-world interest that he did not dream of 
looking for in his own intensely modern country. 
In Nagasaki a learned little Jap staggered him by 
asking eagerly about the antiquities of his own 
Southwest; in Egypt he learned from an English 
traveller that America possessed monuments much 
more ancient than the Sphinx ; and, as he wandered 
among the ruins of Pompeii, he was asked "how 
America was progressing excavating her ruins." It 
is. well that we should be reminded, and reminded 
as effectively as Miss Laut does in this book, that 
we have within comparatively easy reach a vast 
region of limitless interest to the archaeologist, the 
historian, and the simple every-day traveller. 

So universal is the renaissance of 

the drama *-<% that W ? are intel " 
ested in the manifestation of the 

dramatic spirit wherever it appears. Accordingly 
we are ready to welcome Mr. Addison McLeod's 
"Plays and Players of Modern Italy" (Sergei) for 



giving a pretty full treatment of the Italian drama. 
The point of view is that of an Englishman who has 
seen many performances in Italy and who looks at 
them as a student of the theatre rather than of lit- 
erature. There is necessarily a good deal of the 
outlining of plot, which is dull writing and duller 
reading when unenlivened by apt quotation and com- 
ment. From such dulness Mr. McLeod is compar- 
atively free, though at times he is neither very 
interesting nor very clear. He brings out well 
the more striking differences between the Italian 
and the English actor, and shows how the audiences 
naturally react upon the performers. He has ap- 
preciative studies of the great Italian actors, some 
of whom (Duse and Salvini, for example) are well 
known on this side. On the whole, the book gives 
an impression of the author as thoroughly interested 
in the drama and in love with the Italian acting. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Everyman Encyclopaedia " (Dutton), of which 
two volumes are now before us, is published in the 
familiar form and at the low price of the other works 
in " Everyman's Library." There are to be twelve vol- 
umes of the complete set, which means that an English- 
man can acquire for three dollars, and an American for 
four, a really satisfactory work of general reference. 
The volumes contain approximately half a million words 
each, which marvel is accomplished by double -columned 
pages and small but by no means illegible type. Roget's 
" Thesaurus," in two volumes, is another new accession 
to the reference section of " Everyman's Library." 

Professor William Bateson's " Mendel's Principles of 
Heredity" (Cambridge University Press; imported by 
Putnam) still remains the standard handbook of Men- 
delism, notwithstanding the fact that the very rapid 
advance of knowledge in this field since the appearance 
of the enlarged second edition three years ago has ren- 
dered some portions quite out of date. A third impres- 
sion of this notable book has recently been issued, with 
a few pages of additional matter designed to remedy in 
some measure the defect mentioned. What is needed, 
however, as the author recognizes, is an entire re-writing 
of considerable portions of the original text. 

In this day and generation when women are coming 
into their own, such a book as Mr. Willis J Abbot's 
"Notable Women in History" (Winston), giving in 
brief and handy form the chief facts in the lives of 
seventy-three celebrated female characters, ancient and 
modern, is assured of a considerable circulation, and will 
be especially appreciated as a book of reference for 
women's clubs and for the use of those preparing papers 
on the woman movement or some kindred theme. Under 
seven heads " A Group of Classic Dames," " Many 
Queens and Some Martyrs," " Women of Wit and 
Pleasure," " Priestesses of Woman's Cause," " Some 
Women of the Footlights," " Women in Arts and 
Letters," and "Women Who Stand Alone" and with 
a space varying from three to ten pages devoted to each 
character, these little biographies are attractively pre- 
sented, and are in many instances accompanied by a por- 
trait from either a painting or a photograph. The 
book seems especially adapted to the needs and the re- 
sources of our smaller public libraries.

"There have been many books about Mexico and 
her revolution, but none that is quite so ample, 
vivid, and inclusive as this one. The author, Mr. 
Henry Baerlein, was special correspondent of the 
London ' Times ' and already a writer of distinction. 
He seems to have been not only well versed in the 
history and affairs of Mexico, but to have that envi- 
able capacity so useful to the special correspondent 
of entering into intimate relationships with the 
greater and the lesser actors of the drama unfolded 
before his eyes." San Francisco Argonaut.

THE DIAL. [August 16, 1913 



"A masterly setting forth of a series of the most fascinating stories in the nation's history." The Herald (NewYork) . 

Truth is Stranger than Fiction 

A S a rule, probably because we know it only through reading the old-fashioned dry-as-dust 
L\ works, we are apt to consider history as heavy reading, but the modern historical writer 
-A--|L- goes below the surface and seeks out the motives, often hidden, that bring about events, 
and gives us men and women who were the actors in them, as they really were, human, with all 
their merits and faults, their loves and hates. Thus they bring to the eye and mind a panorama 
of past events in just the way the stage does. In life-like pictures of the sort all the romance in 
the story of our country is set before us in the delightful way of the historical novelists, with the 
advantage that truth is indeed often stranger and more romantic than fiction. Few of us, for 
example, care greatly about our early squabble with France, but how interesting we all would 
find the story of our brilliant diplomat who bravely followed Napoleon into the snowy wastes of 
Russia in the effort to obtain redress for certain wrongs and who died in a lonely village near 
Cracow. We would all probably confess that our idea of the conquest of Mexico is one that is 
all of war and bloodshed and of some unnatural demigod-like beings; but the story of Marina, 
the beautiful native, and her part in Cortes's life as viceroy, shows us that they were very human. 

Woman's influence on man has played a much more important part in American history (in 
the White House as well as elsewhere) than a reading of the ordinary histories would lead one 
to suppose. But the fact is, a frivolous woman holds General Howe inactive in Philadelphia 
while a noble one sends a warning to Washington at Valley Forge ; Sacajawea helps and encour- 
ages Lewis and Clark ; another Indian maiden foils Pontiac's conspiracy ; a belle of Baltimore 
stirs up Napoleon's rancor against America; a Dolly Madison cheers up the disheartened while 
the British are within cannon shot of Washington; a woman uplifts Burr, another makes him 
unhappy, still another supports him in his dotage, and so on in hundreds of cases. Catherine 
Motour and Mary Surratt make us shudder, while Jeanne Mance and Helene de Champlain, 
Arabella Johnson and Margaret Brendt, excite our admiration. A true history of America, just 
as any true picture of life, must show the dark as well as the bright side in our story. 

And so up to date and progressive authors, casting aside dry tradition, have given in this 
series accounts that palpitate with life of the peoples of America; all told, as a leading London 
journal says, in a fascinating and brilliant way that is at once entertaining and instructive. 

To illustrate this series, there has been prepared a series of about fifteen hundred facsimiles 
in colors and black and white. Many of the originals, never reproduced before and now issued 
for the first time, cannot be procured in any other way. 

To give an idea of how interesting these are we will send gratis upon receipt of request a 
collection of these subjects, the whole forming an instructive souvenir of the history of America 
that cannot be procured for any price in any other way.

A Master's Degree By MARGARET HILL McCARTER 

This is a big story. It is so because of its theme the greatest of the age self-mastery; 
and it is so because of the masterly treatment of the theme. The author has written gripping 
war tales- here is one on the moral equivalent of war, and no less intense. The superb young 
men and women do more than win victories in athletics and classroom they win out in the 
battle for character. No story could be more moving, and no story more wholesome and 
inspiring. Illustrated by W. D. Goldbeck. i6mo. Net $1.00 

The Dominie of Harlem By ARNOLD MULDER 

Into a Dutch farming settlement in Michigan there comes a young minister who has learned 
the modern, social, and critical viewpoint at a western university. How he finds his work 
paralyzed by a hard bitterness of life which condemns the young people of the community to a 
joyless existence leading straight to their degeneracy, and how he meets the situation, are told 
with a full knowledge of the daily life, with an insight into the psychology of the transplanted 
Hollander farmer, and with a charm of presentation, that will make this one of the most notable 
novels of the season. 127/10. Net $1.25 

Captain Protheroe's Fortune By OSWALD KENDALL 

A "treasure-hunting" story. The stirring setting of the tale is in the North Pacific's icy 
seas, where the adventurers battle with cold and storm. The men are of the dauntless, uncon- 
querable sort; one of them, the English cockney cook, is a genuine humorist a pathetic 
character, yet the irrepressible jollier of the company in the most desperate days. Illustrated by

The Wilderness Castaways By DILLON WALLACE 

A splendid boys' story is this chronicle of the adventures of a pampered New York youth 
and a sturdy sailor lad who are lost from a hunting party in sub-Arctic regions and pass a winter 
of peril and hardship amid ice and barren coasts. Their hunting exploits, their narrow escapes 
from death, and the effect of it all on the character of the once selfish and useless New Yorker, 
are told with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. It is a book that will make the youthful blood 
tingle with excitement, and at the same time enhance youthful enthusiasm for the manly, 
self-reliant life. Illustrated by H. S. Watson. I2mo. Net $1.25 

The Odyssey of the Philippine Commission By DANIEL R. WILLIAMS 

The author of this important and interesting work traveled all over the Islands with the 
Commission headed by Mr. Taft and he has since been engaged in various aspects of legal work 
in Manila. He describes the journeys of the Commission, tells what it saw and what was its 
significance, and throws much fresh light on the psychology of the Filipinos. More than 
this, it is a record by "one who knows" of what America has done for the Philippines, and 
throws valuable light on one of the big problems that now confronts American statesmanship.

of the Jesuits, who had a mission there among the Abenakis, 
from old-time letters and unpublished manuscripts, from early 
newspapers and for the later decades from her own girlhood 
memories, Mrs. Nason has produced in this volume a picture of 
the social and intellectual life of Old Hallowell, notable not only 
for its scholarly accuracy, but also for its rare literary charm. 
The volume is illustrated with sixty-four full-page half-tones

1913] THE DIAL, 129 

Hall 
Caine's 

Masterpiece of Fiction 

The Woman 
Thou Gavest Me 

Being the Story of Mary O'Neill 

DO you know this powerful story is Hall Caine's first novel in four years? It is on 
the presses in eleven European languages and in Japanese. A leading magazine 
paid $25,000 for the serial rights, and has offered the author $100,000 for his 
next four years' work. The offices of the magazine have already received 5000 appli- 
cations for the book. These facts should convince you of the world-wide interest and 
discussion which the story is arousing. 

You have not read recently anything so startling as the revelations of Mary 
O'Neill. Hall Caine's imaginative genius has arranged them into a novel of most ab- 
sorbing interest the story of a great love, which every one will read with deep emotion. 

We believe Mary O'Neill is a real woman, but regardless of that there are Mary 
O'Neills in every community. Hers is the very heart of every woman. It is a book that 
will strike to the core of every heart. 

It contains the greatest analysis of the modern marriage ever written. Hall Caine's 
conclusions, drawn from a close observation of real conditions, are grippingly convincing. 

It is unquestionably Hall Caine's finest achievement, and deals with the great ever- 
lasting human problem, the greatest of human problems, the place of woman in the 
scheme of the world, the story of a woman's life in its most human, most intimate, 
most poignant phases. 

It is a book you should not miss reading, as it will take its place with the great 
classics in literature. 

Price, $1.35 net. Postpaid, $1.50 

This is one of those vital stories of real life that will be talked about among all classes of 
People. Order a copy at once and be one of the first readers.

IN LONDON 

"Abounds in thoughtful delineation of character,

in its refined and spiritual intensity, a refreshing con- 
trast to much that is overheated in the fiction of the 
day." The Times (London). 

IN BOSTON 

" Bigger and broader than anything Mr. Churchill 
has yet written . . . this novel is destined to be of 
importance among thinking people . . . worth read- 
ing for its pure English, for the enjoyment of a story 
well-told, for what it teaches, <and a careless world

LIBRARY THEORY AND PRACTICE. 

One of the puzzling questions repeatedly 
confronting the library worker, as well as all 
the rest of mankind, is how to keep theory and 
practice within some measurable distance of 
each other. The ideal and the real are perpet- 
ually playing at hide-and-seek in this world of 
ours, so that for the greater part of the time 
the one is completely out of sight of the other. 
Systems that work charmingly on paper prove 
elsewhere as disinclined to go as was Obstinate 
to leave the City of Destruction. Rules and 
principles that seem to the library-school stu- 
dent in his library-school days so beautiful and 
at the same time so important and so practic- 
able that all the world of books and readers 
ought to find its highest pleasure in conforming 
thereto, have a mysterious way in after life of 
developing an unexpected and highly unwel- 
come inapplicability to concrete cases. But 
what is the use of two laborious years, or it 
may have been three, at Albany or the Pratt 
Institute if one is to fall back ignominiously at 
last on plain common-sense or rule-of -thumb or 
other unsanctioned substitute for the printed 
precept and the approved formula? And is it a 
thing to be contemplated with equanimity that 
one should actually be tempted to laugh at 
one's former zeal in learning certain grand 
general principles and a multitude of minute 
details that somehow fail afterward to demon- 
strate their intimate relation with the every- 
day duties of a hard- worked librarian? But 
conscientious endeavor to live up to the very 
letter of library law is fraught with the danger 
of making oneself a ridiculous, stiff-jointed 
pedant instead of a pleasing, popular, and pliant 
servant of the book-reading public. 

Memory retains, with most of us, indelible 
impressions of those beautifully engraved lines 
at the top of our copy-book pages, that served as 
models on which we shaped our early exercises 
in penmanship. In the remote past of the 
eighties and seventies and sixties, it was the 
gracefully sloping Spencerian caligraphy that 
we painfully imitated, with tongue in cheek 
and head inclined at an angle of forty-five de- 
grees. Later decades have seen the rise of the 
uncompromising up-and-down or vertical style 



132 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



of handwriting, intolerant of meaningless cur- 
licues and having in general, with all its prim 
regularity, something of the plainness of a board 
fence. But the persistence of either manner in 
the penmanship of a person who has arrived at 
years of discretion is something that makes one 
smile and form an immediate and not altogether 
complimentary opinion of that person's force 
and originality. Why, then, are we taught to 
write in a fashion that we are expected to cast 
aside a few years later? Obviously, because 
there is no other advisable course for all con- 
cerned than to teach the " faultily faultless " 
style to begin with, and then leave it to the 
pupil to develop his own characteristic varia- 
tions on the model as he approaches maturity. 
So with library theory ; a method unworkable 
in all its details in any single public library, 
but beautifully adapted to the ideal library in 
an ideal community, is the only possible one for 
teaching purposes, while the variations and irreg- 
ularities, the short-cuts and the novel adjust- 
ments and the temporary expedients, must be 
left to evolve for themselves (with the alert and 
resourceful librarian's aid) in the storm and 
stress of actual library service. 

The story is well known of the learned college 
professor who awoke one night in a cold sweat 
from a nightmare in which he dreamt of being 
compelled, in order to retain his chair, to pass 
the entrance examinations at the institution 
where he taught a test that taxed his powers 
to the breaking point. How many of our fore- 
most librarians would thoroughly enjoy taking 
the examinations required for a diploma at the 
Albany library school? And how many of 
those who every year pass these examinations 
most brilliantly will ever be heard of again as 
heads of the leading large libraries ? Few prac- 
tising physicians would undertake to compete 
successfully with seniors at the medical school 
for academic honors, and not many veteran 
lawyers would face with entire confidence a 
searching test in Blackstone and Kent. In 
Trollope's novel, " The Eustace Diamonds," 
Arthur Herriot, a young and as yet briefless 
barrister, is represented as always carrying 
about with him a volume or two of Stone and 
Toddy's "Digest of the Common Law," at 
which he grinds away industriously; while his 
friend Frank Greystock, who has already 
achieved success and enjoys a lucrative prac- 
tice, hardly ever gives a thought to the law. 
" The best of the legal profession," declares the 
author, " consists in this that when you get 
fairly at work you may give over working. An 



aspirant must learn everything ; but a man may 
make his fortune at it, and know almost nothing. 
He may examine a witness with judgment, see 
through a case with precision, address a jury 
with eloquence, and yet may be altogether ignor- 
ant of the law. But he must be believed to be 
a very pundit before he will get a chance of exer- 
cising his judgment, his precision, or his elo- 
quence. The men whose names are always in 
the newspapers never look at their Stone and 
Toddy care for it not at all have their Stone 
and Toddy got up for them by their juniors 
when cases require that reference shall be made 
to precedents." 

That is rather cynical and flippant, even 
though it may be not without a grain of truth, 
and the contempt felt by Trollope's successful 
lawyer for Stone and Toddy need not argue a 
like contempt for Dewey and Cutter on the part 
of the successful librarian. Let it not be sup- 
posed that any part of the purpose of this article 
is to throw discredit on the training school of 
any profession. The ideally perfect system of 
library economy has to be taught before the 
more or less faulty practice can be taken up to 
the best advantage ; and, after all, what working 
librarian who has entered his profession by the 
way of Albany or the Pratt Institute or other 
approved route, does not look back most grate- 
fully upon that preliminary drill in the theory of 
his calling? In that enjoyable sheaf of alumni 
memories included in the recent pamphlet ("The 
First Quarter Century of the New York State 
Library School") issued at Albany, occurs a 
significant passage from the pen of Mr. Edwin 
H. Anderson, who has lately succeeded Dr. 
Billings as Director of the New York Public 
Library. "Having been," he says, "some 
years out of college when I entered the school, 
I naturally found the close study of the many 
details of library work, and especially the 
minutiae of cataloguing, very irksome. When I 
tried to learn to write catalogue cards in ' library 
hand,' I felt like an elephant trying to do fancy 
needlework. I shall never forget the gory red 
of the reviser's corrections on my cards. I was 
inclined to cavil at many of the minute, not to 
say fussy, details of cataloguing. I still think 
some of them were fussy ; but I had not been 
long engaged in practical library work before I 
saw reasons for most of those minute details. I 
suppose there is no more assured maker of col- 
lege curricula than the freshman, and I remem- 
ber that during my first term in the school I 
had little doubt that I could vastly improve its 
curriculum. Now, after twenty years' experi- 



1913] 



THE DIAL

ence as a librarian, during which I have had 
more or less to do with the management of three 
library schools, I am not so confident." 

This conflict, whether real or only apparent, 
between theory and practice in every profession 
is, of course, merely one manifestation of a strife 
as old as humanity; and undoubtedly neither 
idealists nor realists, neither Platonists nor Aris- 
totelians, will ever succeed in having things all 
their own way. But it is remarkable how within 
the twenty-five years of library-school history 
the ready jibe at school-made librarians has died 
on the scorner's tongue, and the school itself has 
won its right to stand unchallenged beside the 
other professional schools, which in their turn 
were once compelled to show reason why they 
should be suffered to exist. Thus the thoughts 
of men are widened with the process of the suns ; 
and to what still undreamt-of achievements 
library theory shall break the road for timid 
and doubting practice, remains to be seen. 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

HOME BEADING, both for pleasure and for profit, 
receives in these days the encouragement offered by 
an increasing production of books at prices which, 
especially in the case of reprints, are within the 
reach of nearly all, by the steady growth of the 
public library system and the attention now given to 
bringing the books almost to the very doors of the 
people, by the extension of university instruction, 
and by other agencies tending to implant a thirst 
for book-knowledge. Nevertheless the reported 
instances of a decrease in the circulation of public 
library books are becoming rather frequent, and 
one wishes to know the reason why. The James V. 
Brown Library of Williamsport, Pa., is among the 
latest to announce a marked and rather puzzling 
falling-off in the home use of its books. The libra- 
rian, in his current Report, gives a considerable 
number of what he regards as contributory causes, 
such as the increasing vogue of all sorts of pastimes, 
the multiplication of societies and clubs of many 
kinds, the spread of nature-study, the enlistment of 
the young in the army of Boy Scouts and Camp Fire 
Girls, and the demands made on the time of those 
who, especially in the summer season, feel it their 
duty as well as their pleasure to attend out-door con- 
tests of various sorts and to give a vociferous moral 
support to the side they wish to see victorious. 
These numerous distractions may well operate in the 
manner indicated by the Williamsport librarian. 
Two other possible factors in the situation may 
here be brought to notice for what they are worth. 
The improved facilities for reading and study within 
the library itself, with its well-equipped reference 
rooms and expert attendants, invite the visitor to 
pursue his researches and even to read his favorite 



novelist within the library precincts instead of carry- 
ing the books home and back. Secondly, though this 
may have but little effect on the final result, the re- 
vival of the long-winded novel has made it impossible 
for the fiction-lover to read as many current novels 
as twenty years ago, when the pocket size of romance 
was in favor. The 625 pages, in rather close print, 
of "The Amateur Gentleman" would make three 
novels of the size of "The House of the Wolf," or 
six of the dimensions of "Mademoiselle Ixe." Mr. 
De Morgan, Mr. Arnold Bennett, Mr. H. G. Wells, 
Mr. Henry Sydnor Harrison, and many others of 
their guild, are now giving us in their books good 
measure, pressed down and shaken together and run- 
ning over ; and as fiction figures more largely in a 
public library's circulation than any other class of 
literature, the ponderous bulk of the novel of the 
day may be a not wholly negligible factor in bring- 
ing about a diminution in the number of books 
drawn for home use. 

LITERARY CRITICISM THAT STIMULATES is the 
kind that seems to have been dealt out to Mr. James 
Lane Allen, who, in a recent interview, is reported 
as saying in regard to the relation between author 
and critic : " The total result of this relation may be 
broken into many partial results. One is that the 
sympathies of the body of critics pass by way of the 
books over to the great body of creative workers. 
This is the first and chief value of such criticism 
that it puts new life into the authors. This result is 
direct and positive and of incalculable value to the 
body of workers." To have one's book reviewed by 
one hundred and fifty critics, working independently, 
and to find, as Mr. Allen has often found, one hun- 
dred and forty of them in substantial agreement, he 
declares to be an amazing experience, "as amazing 
as would be the verdict in an imaginary case at law 
in which one hundred and fifty jurors should sift 
the evidence, each in solitary confinement, and then 
march back to the court-room to give a verdict of 
acquittal or the reverse. Such a result as this could 
not possibly be reached unless these one hundred 
and fifty human minds were working sincerely and 
intelligently. The knowledge that they do so work 
makes the author one in humanity with these work- 
ers, not one of whom he will possibly ever meet. 
There is no measure of how vital such an experience 
is. Simply by it we acquire faith in human nature. 
And the more faith an author has in human nature, 
the better his work will be. The less faith he has, 
the worse his work will be. All real literature is 
faith in human nature." Between this pleasing pic- 
ture of a sympathetic bond uniting author and critic, 
and the vision of a Keats done to death by a Quar- 
terly Reviewer (though, fortunately, that famous 
legend has no historical basis), what a contrast! 



MILTON'S TESTIMONY IN THE SHAKESPEARE- 
BACON CONTROVERSY ought to be of weight, for 
his life and Shakespeare's overlapped each other by 
eight years, and the author of " Paradise Lost " was 
eighteen years old when Bacon died. Therefore we 



134 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



follow with interest Sir Edwin Burning-Lawrence's 
argument to prove that Milton was a Baconian. The 
proof is simple and unanswerable. In the great 
poet's tribute to Shakespeare, beginning, "What 
neede my Shakespeare for his honour'd bones," Sir 
Edwin favors in the fourth line the less common 
reading, " starre-ypointed," instead of " starre- 
ypointing," and "a starre-ypointed Pyramid" is 
obviously a beacon ; and if the word beacon was not 
pronounced bacon in Milton's time, it surely ought 
to have been, to make perfect this beautiful proof 
that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Sir Edwin is to be 
congratulated on having discovered this convincing 
bit of evidence in the great question. But we have 
recently hit upon an even more remarkable, because 
more adroitly concealed, expression of opinion on 
the burning issue. Coming down two centuries from 
Milton to Matthew Arnold, we find in the latter's 
sonnet on Shakespeare irrefutable proof that this 
distinguished poet of the nineteenth century dis- 
cerned, even though he did not venture openly to 
proclaim, the real authorship of the works attributed 
to Shakespeare. In the last line of the sonnet 
note the poet's subtlety in choosing the very last line 
as a hiding place for his cryptogram we find the 
name of Bacon very cleverly concealed ; and no 
small part of the cleverness lies in the fact that 
there is just enough method in the scheme to show 
design, and just enough irregularity to suggest mere 
chance. But no accidental juxtaposition of words 
and letters can account for what we will now disclose. 
The last line reads, " Find their sole speech in that 
victorious brow." Now note that the very last word 
begins with b, the third word from the end contains 
the vowel a, the fifth from the end has the letter c, 
the third from the beginning has the vowel 0, and 
the first word has the consonant n. There we have 
the name Bacon complete. If anyone objects that 
in all this there is nothing but chance, and not the 
faintest trace of design, we would ask whether any 
tossing about of the words of the dictionary for a 
million ages would ever be likely to result in just 
the combination of words the poet has here written 
in his closing line. We trow not. 

* 

THE OUTRAGED ORTHOEPIST gives public expres- 
sion to his feelings from time to time in magazine 
or newspaper articles urging a reform in our habits 
of speech, a less clipped and slurred pronunciation 
of our words. Americans are notorious, the world 
over, for their faulty articulation; and this unwise 
economy of vocal energy has not only disfigured our 
language to the ear, but has also given aid and 
comfort to the so-called reformers of our spelling. 
If the word programme, for instance, is repeatedly 
heard as program (or progrum), with strong accent 
on the first syllable and almost no vowel sound in 
the second, why, it is asked, should it not be written 
as it is pronounced ? No wonder that our country 
takes the lead in " spelling reform," having already 
so effectually divorced the spoken from the written 
language. Strange and startling are the tricks that 



mispronunciation plays with spelling. Lamentably 
common is it to meet with the expression "would 
of " for " would have " in the correspondence of the 
careless in speech. The now all but universal use 
of will for shall and of would for should is prob- 
ably due largely to the greater ease of saying " I 
will," or "I'll," "we will," or "we'll," "I would," 
or " I 'd," " we would," or " we 'd," than of articu- 
lating " I shall," " I should," etc. Thus the evil 
results of slovenly utterance show themselves in 
grammar as well as in spelling, and the stately 
structure of our ancestral tongue is slowly but surely 
yielding to the insidious assaults of carelessness, 
abuse, indolence, mistaken zeal in efforts at reform, 
and other influences. Will a better and more ser- 
viceable instrument of communication be evolved in 
the distant future, through this process, or will the 
language, by clipping and slurring, be reduced to a 
system of monosyllabic grunts, helped out by gesture 
and facial expression ? Certain present indications 
seem almost to warrant the assertion that our speech 
is passing, as Herbert Spencer might express it, from 
a relatively definite, coherent heterogeneity to a 
relatively indefinite, incoherent homogeneity. 

INADEQUATE SECURITY TO MANUSCRIPT COLLEC- 
TIONS, as indeed to collections in general, both of 
books and of paintings and of the miscellaneous 
treasures gathered together in museums, is far more 
common than the perfect safeguarding of such col- 
lections from the risks of fire and other dangers. 
The Virginia State Librarian, Mr. H. R. Mcllwaine, 
calls attention, in the " Ninth Annual Report " of 
the Virginia State Library, to an unsatisfactory con- 
dition that he almost succeeded in remedying, but 
failed by a single vote in the upper legislative cham- 
ber at Richmond. Responsible for the custody of 
a valuable collection of manuscripts, Mr. Mcllwaine 
bestirred himself to secure an appropriation for fire- 
proof quarters. His own account of his fortunes in 
the attempt is worth quoting. He says : " I regret 
to report, however, that failure was my portion, 
though representatives of all the patriotic societies 
in the State worked for the attainment of the same 
object. A special bill was drawn up by a committee 
of the Sons of the Revolution calling for the appro- 
priation of $6000 for this object, and when the 
advocates of the bill were given a hearing by the 
Senate Finance Committee a large and cultivated 
audience of ladies and gentlemen assembled and 
strong appeals were made. The bill, however, was 
not reported. Nor was the item included in the 
appropriation bill as reported to the two houses. In 
this emergency I was instructed by the executive 
committee of the Library Board to use my best en- 
deavors to have the item inserted in the bill both 
on the floor of the Senate and on the floor of the 
House. In the House my efforts met with success, 
and they came within one vote of being successful 
in the Senate, where the proposed amendment to 
the bill received a vote of twenty. Twenty was a 
majority of those present, but not a majority of the

total membership of the Senate, which, it was ruled 
by the chair, the amendment must have in order to 
carry." And so the Sisyphean task must be renewed 
with the next General Assembly. The fire at Albany 
should have taught a lesson to all concerned with 
State libraries, but there is still a tendency to defer 
the locking of the garage door till the automobile is 
stolen. m t , 

PRELIMINARIES TO LITERARY STUDY, the mas- 
tering of one's own language and of the rudiments 
of at least a few foreign tongues, should of course 
receive attention in the adolescent period, even 
though one may, like Cato and Mrs. Howe, take a 
fancy to Greek at a later season in life and pursue 
its study with relish and profit. The President of 
Amherst, in a recent utterance on the subject of 
preparation for college, urges that all merely dis- 
ciplinary studies should be completed at school. 
" Whatever acquaintance," he says, " with other 
languages a student may need in college should be 
given him during those earlier years when the mind 
is better adapted to acquiring them. The college 
should be free to lead the student into the thought 
and experience of foreign peoples by means of the 
languages in which the people have expressed them- 
selves. In general, the merely disciplinary studies 
should be finished in the school. Admission to col- 
lege should imply that the student already has a 
mind trained to the intellectual attitude, and which 
is now to be strengthened, enlarged, and made skil- 
ful by activity within the fields for which it was 
prepared." In this connection it is interesting to 
note how much longer the period of docility, of 
teachableness or ability to learn, extends with some 
persons than with others. Some harden early into 
a mental rigidity that forbids the attempt to acquire 
new knowledge, and others are to their dying day 
like Portia in her youth, happy in this that they 
are not yet so old but they may learn. Wise and 
excellent as are the foregoing words of President 
Meiklejohn, those are fortunate who never outgrow 
their capability of finding enjoyment and improve- 
ment even in disciplinary study, by which are 
opened new paths of learning. 

BOOK-BUYING AND BOOK-BORROWING are both 
commendable practices, even though the grave 
Polonius does counsel his son Laertes to be neither 
a borrower nor a lender; but that was in the days 
before lending libraries. Some well-considered ad- 
vice on what books to buy and what to borrow, in 
this age when so small a proportion of all the good 
books published can be bought by any one reader 
of average means, is contributed to the London 
"Book Monthly" by a writer signing himself or 
herself " D. Mere," who names as examples certain 
old authors and sundry anthologies and other handy 
compilations that pay handsomely for their lodging 
and maintenance by the pleasure they confer. But 
the free use of the lending library, whether public 
or subscription, is urged upon him who would be 



wise in both his buying and his borrowing of books. 
Emerson's adage, that a good book should be kept 
in circulation, certainly gives countenance to the 
unabashed borrower of others' books; and if it is 
not yet a proverb that the fool keepeth his books 
on his shelves, but the wise man carryeth them in 
his head, it ought to be and some day will be. 
Conscious of having all the standard authors in his 
library, accessible at any moment, many a well-to- 
do householder never gets beyond a distant acquaint- 
ance with the great writers, knowing them merely 
by sight, that is by binding, whereas if he were 
forced to go a few blocks for his Macaulay, his 
Ruskin, or his Thackeray, he might be impelled to 
read them. And with some, though not with all, 
it is a matter of conscience to read promptly a 
borrowed book, and then return it. A strong case 
could be made out for the inadvisability of owning 
too many books, and the consequent advisability of 
frequent and copious borrowing. No sensible man 
of means keeps all his money in his house, but most 
of it in the bank. The public library is the wise 
man's literary bank. 

UNIVERSITY ACTIVITIES IN TEXAS deserve notice. 
A legislative reference bureau, that useful wing 
lately added to the public library edifice, has been 
established by one of the professors at the State 
University (which, it will be recalled, has its seat at 
the State capital) for the benefit of the Texas legis- 
lators in their drafting of bills and passing of laws. 
This bureau is an innovation in the Southwest, 
though not new to the country at large, and cannot 
fail to prove its usefulness. Another professor has 
given his expert assistance to the organization of a 
land-credit banking association, another innovation 
in that part of the country and possibly of less as- 
sured success than the legislative reference bureau, 
although we are not in a position to speak with 
authority concerning this. In various other ways 
the young and vigorous Texas University is widen- 
ing its activities, and is meeting with corresponding 
encouragement from the community which it serves. 
So rapid, in fact, has been its recent growth that it 
has been compelled to erect temporary wooden 
buildings for additional classrooms, laboratories, and 
offices. To secure the permanent buildings so much 
needed, a legislative provision recently submitted to 
popular vote authorizes the university to issue bonds 
on the security of its permanent endowment, the 
interest and sinking fund to be provided for out of 
the income from the two million acres of public land 
which it holds. The Lone Star State bids fair to 
rival in the near future such States as Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois in the size and 
varied usefulness of its chief educational institution. 

A REMODELLED "JOURNAL OF CIVILIZATION" 

makes its appearance in the new "Harper's Weekly," 
of which the first number under its new editor, Mr. 
Norman Hapgood, bears the date, August 16. 
" Harper's Weekly : A Journal of Civilization " is 



136 



[Sept. 1 



now in its fifty-eighth volume and approaching its 
three thousandth issue; and as civilization is a 
changeable thing, it is fitting that this, its hebdom- 
adal exponent, should change with it. Its new 
form, with reduced page-size and altered style of 
illustration, its various other proposed departures 
from ancient usage, its enlightened attitude on the 
woman question, its hopes for success in an earnest 
appeal to the better class of readers most of this is 
touched upon by the editor in his printed "Program" 
and elsewhere in the attractive first issue under his 
direction. In matters more especially literary he 
thus promisingly expresses himself: "In the treat- 
ment of books the same plan will be followed. We 
shall make no effort at reviewing everything, or 
nearly everything, as we do not care to load the 
paper with discussions of what has no interest; but 
we shall be sharply on the watch for books that 
signify, and shall point out to our readers why we 
think these particular books ought not to be over- 
looked. . . . Fiction will appear only as an element 
in the variety of human interests. We do not wish 
to push it too much to the front, because we desire 
to have the paper in its proportions reproduce the 
interests of the most energetic and important class 
of Americans. . . . We are not to be a high-brow 
publication, in the limited sense, but we do not intend 
to collect a lot of low-brows." The general effect of 
the new "Weekly" is one of animation, alertness, 
straightforwardness, searching analysis in criticism 
and comment, novelty in pictorial illustration, and, 
throughout, a high degree of readability. 



THEMES FORBIDDEN THE BRITISH STAGE have 
commonly included biblical subjects and those 
otherwise of a sacred or religious character, and, 
of course, the royal family. Nevertheless it ap- 
pears that Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree is now to 
be allowed to place Joseph and his brethren in the 
glare of the footlights. A compatriot of his who has 
suffered from the strictness of official censorship is 
reported as exulting in this unhoped-for victory of 
the drama over the censor. "This is a clever mana- 
gerial coup d'etat," declares Mr. Stephen Phillips, 
"and he has now once and for all 'drawn the bad- 
ger,' which can never again retreat into its hole. 
Henceforward, unless the Censorship should prove 
itself even more illogical than in the past, the great 
field of Old Testament history lies open to the 
poet, a field not less fertile than the Greek." This 
recalls Mr. Phillips's clash with the constituted 
authorities when he undertook to dramatise the 
story of Jephthah's daughter and was forced to shift 
his scene to Greece and name his heroine Icle; 
and although the Hebrew legend has its close 
parallels in Greek as in the story of Idomeneus, 
king of Crete, and in that of Agamemnon and 
Iphigenia he lamented the hard necessity imposed 
upon him. Jephthah, however, is no stranger to the 
stage, and must have been often seen by theatre- 
goers in the past. Brewer's " Reader's Handbook " 
gives a number of English plays on the theme. 



THE INCOHERENT LETTER- WRITER is known to 

us all. His, or more often her, serene disregard 
of syntax, and sometimes of grammar as well, 
together with a restraint in the use of punctuation- 
marks that verges on total abstinence, would be 
amusing if it were not for the resultant unintelli- 
gibility of what is written. In a contribution to 
"The Outlook" from Mr. Edward Bok, on the 
question, " Is the College Making Good ? " there are 
given some surprising examples of epistolary com- 
position from the pens of young ladies on the point 
of graduation from college, with fifteen or sixteen 
years of school training behind them. To the 
question, what the college has done for her, physi- 
cally, socially, and intellectually, one of these near- 
graduates replies, in part: "For in college we have 
societies and houses to keep in order. We have 
dinners and parties to superintend and cook and 
all for fun." Is there some subtle design in the 
chiastic arrangement, " dinner and parties to super- 
intend and cook " ? Another young lady writes : 
"She uses her brain in other words. And finally 
I think most of them have won a vision at least of 
what marraige may mean. College brings out the 
best that is in one, it makes us stand up for the 
best and noblest things in life and developes all our 
faculties." Such examples of what American edu- 
cation can do for the American young woman give 
us pause. 

A FAMOUS AUTHOR'S NURSE becomes an object 
of public interest when she has been immortalized 
by that author's pen. Miss Alison Cunningham, 
who recently died at the good old age of ninety-two, 
was noted for her inexhaustible fund of tales and 
legends, which she drew upon freely for the amuse- 
ment of her frail little charge, the infant Robert 
Louis Stevenson; and he repaid her loving care 
and patient tendance with a lifelong affection and 
esteem. To him she was always the "Gummy" of 
his lisping childhood, and he has left written evi- 
dence of his attachment in both prose and verse. 
A letter addressed to her in his youth contains the 
following significant passage: "Do not suppose, 
Cummy, that I shall ever forget those long, bitter 
nights, when I coughed and coughed, and was so 
unhappy, and you were so patient and loving with 
a poor, sick child. Indeed, Cummy, I wish I 
might become a man worth talking about, if it 
were only that you should not have thrown away 
your pains." Touching and beautiful are the dedi- 
catory lines, "To Alison Cunningham, from her 
Boy," prefixed to "A Child's Garden of Verses." 

THE GROWTH OF THE INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SYS- 
TEM proceeds with encouraging acceleration. At 
the Williams College Library, for instance, where 
we remember an order of things in which coopera- 
tive action extending beyond the college precincts 
was unknown, the literary resources of other insti- 
tutions are now freely drawn upon, and similar 
loans are made to them. The librarian, Mr. John

Adams Lowe, writes in his annual report, just 
issued: "The courtesy of inter-library loans brought 
for the use of professors twenty-seven books from 
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Boston. Recently 
the resources of the New York State Library have 
been re-opened to us, for two hundred thousand 
volumes have been gathered since the fire two years 
ago. We have taken pleasure in response to requests 
from libraries to loan sixty-seven volumes for study 
purposes. We deem it a privilege if we may render 
some service to the Commonwealth by extending 
the courtesies of the library to those whose limited 
funds prohibit the purchase of books already on our 
shelves. Probably the most important contribution 
we were able to make in this line this year was the 
loan of the manuscript letters of Jean Paul Richter 
to Wilhelmine von Kropf to Yale University Library 
for the use of the German exchange professor, who 
is a co-editor of a new edition of Richter's works." 



LITERARY INCOMES IN ENGLAND. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
About once a year one of the London papers opens its 
columns to the fascinating subject of authors' incomes. 
Usually this takes place on the publication of a novel 
by Miss Marie Corelli or Mr. Hall Caine the two 
writers who are commonly regarded as the commercial 
heads of the great profession which they have adorned 
so long. Indeed, it is not a little remarkable to note 
how regularly each new book of theirs is the signal for 
a column or more of information as to the habits, rec- 
reations, sorrows, or profits of a class that is permitted 
to work unobtrusively enough during the rest of the 
year. The publication of a new novel by Mr. Caine or 
Miss Corelli is, of course, a Literary Event, likely in 
itself to stimulate discussion on literary subjects in 
general. But it commonly happens, by some curious 
chance, that some untoward accident takes place, either 
just before or immediately after its appearance, which 
has the effect of focussing public attention on the 
author. Miss Corelli has a quarrel with the critics, 
and refuses to permit copies of her book to be sent out 
for review; Mr. Caine is justifiably annoyed at finding 
the circulating libraries have placed a black mark 
against his name as a purveyor of literature unsuitable 
for the eye of the Young Person. Forthwith appear 
letters, interviews, leading articles on one side and the 
other; when the novel is at last safely launched the 
struggling journalist, feeling that literary subjects are 
still in the air, bethinks himself of floating off one or 
two of those informative articles that have been lying 
idle in his desk since the last suitable occasion. " Lit- 
erature as a Road to Wealth " appears accordingly in 
one of the cheaper morning papers, offering a text on 
which it may be interesting to say a few words out of 
the fulness of personal experience. 

It is calculated by the writer of the article that a 
moderately successful novelist in this country can make 
money at the rate of ten pounds an hour of his working 
time. A man of established reputation receives twenty 
to twenty-five per cent royalty on the published price of 
his book; a sale of ten thousand copies would therefore 
bring in to the fortunate author of a six shilling novel 
the reasonable sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds. 



Add to this another five hundred for serial rights, and 
assume that the ordinary successful novel has a selling 
life of ten years after publication, and the sum is worked 
up to quite a respectable figure. And then there are the 
dramatic rights, and (though they are not mentioned in 
this article) the cinematographic rights, to say nothing 
of translation. I forget into how many languages Mr. 
Caine's latest work has already been translated, but I 
think I counted fourteen, including Japanese and Yiddish. 
We come at last to the conclusion that Miss Corelli must 
have made twenty thousand pounds at least from each 
of her novels, and that Mr. Caine has certainly made 
much more than this. Clearly, from the commercial 
point of view, the career of a successful novelist, even if 
he restricts himself to the production of only one book 
a year, compares favorably with most of the learned 
professions. 

I do not trust implicitly the calculations of the intrepid 
journalist on matters of this kind. But he is probably 
correct enough when he states that there are barely ten 
novelists in this country who earn more than five thou- 
sand pounds a year from fiction alone. The names that 
he gives (somewhat rashly, for it is quite as easy to con- 
fine oneself to general statements ) of these happy pluto- 
crats of letters are as follows: Caine, Wells, Garvice, 
Stacpoole, Conan Doyle, Kipling, Miss Corelli, and Mrs. 
Humphry Ward. I confess the introduction of Mr. de 
Vere Stacpoole's name surprised me. No doubt it is a 
compliment to be included in a list of this kind, but I 
am expecting some of these gentlemen to write letters 
of protest and renunciation: the honor may be all very 
well, but the attentions of the Income Tax Assessors are 
not so pleasant. And an average income of twenty-five 
thousand dollars a year, from fiction alone, means a large 
number of readers in these days of circulating libraries, 
when there are a dozen or more borrowing readers for 
a single buyer. The late George Meredith, I believe, 
never received so much as a thousand pounds in any 
one year of his lifetime from the sale of his novels. He 
wrote for posterity; but many of those who aim stead- 
fastly at an immediate popularity fail to reach his modest 
figures. The writer in the London " Daily Express " 
from whose article I am quoting declares roundly that 
not more than fifty living British novelists make an 
average income of five thousand dollars. 

The fact is, that of late years every change that has 
been made in the world of publishing and bookselling 
has been in favor of the few big sellers and against the 
author with a small, if select, audience. The cheap six- 
penny and sevenpenny editions of recent novels are all 
to the good of the popular writer: they give his book 
another lease of life, and himself another set of royal- 
ties; more than this, they assist in spreading his name 
and fame among a class of readers whom he had not 
reached before. But these cheap novels, excellently 
produced as they are, and eagerly welcomed by the rail- 
way traveller and the lover of fiction who cannot afford 
to buy crown octavo volumes at six shillings apiece, get 
sadly in the way of the less successful novelist who is 
accustomed to receive his fifty or a hundred pounds in 
advance of royalties. The latter finds the sales of his 
six shilling novels dwindling year by year. Five or six 
years ago he used to sell something between two and 
three thousand copies; now he finds his sales have 
decreased to fifteen or sixteen hundred. He does not 
retire from the business, because, perhaps, he is one of 
those who write from the point of view of the artist. 
He feels an impulse to express himself through this 



138

medium. And if he is a true artist, as sometimes he is, 
there is probably somewhere a certain little ring of read- 
ers who appreciate his work and would be sorry to lose 
him. But it is becoming a serious matter to him, this 
steady cheapening of fiction. I have often wondered 
how some of our great novelists would have survived 
had they been born in the age of reprints. Meredith 
himself was fortunate enough to produce most of his 
fiction under the old system of the three-volume novel, 
a system that ensured some monetary return for good 
though not necessarily popular work. If a new Meredith 
were to arise to-day it is not unlikely that the publishers 
would get tired of producing his books at a loss before 
he had succeeded in educating a sufficient section of the 
reading public into a suitable appreciation of his genius. 

Several causes have conspired of late to chill the 
enthusiasm of those gallant readers who used to lay out 
their money in new fiction at six shillings (four shillings 
and sixpence net) per volume. He (or she, for the 
great novel-readers have generally been the women) 
used to buy them on the bookstalls when they were 
setting out on a railway journey; they sometimes were 
known to go into a book-shop and order as many as a 
score at a time if they were going abroad or up to Scot- 
land for the shooting season. Now, instead of travelling 
by rail, they are whirled away in their motor-cars, where 
reading is a vexation of the spirit if not a frank impos- 
sibility. Indeed, these motor-cars, and the growth of 
the week-end habit, have pretty nearly killed the gentle 
practice of novel-reading among the wealthier classes. 
The bulk of readers now are drawn from a different 
stratum of society altogether from the finished prod- 
ucts of the primary schools. Coming fresh into the 
field of fiction, it is only to be expected that their taste 
should at first be for the simple and straightforward 
story of incident and adventure rather than for the more 
subtle school of character-analysis. The servants' hall 
and the parlor of the small tradesman absorb the great 
majority of the cheap sixpenny editions that go to build 
up these incomes of five thousand a year. Possibly in 
time their taste will develop : they may turn to the novels 
of Mr. Arnold Bennett or of Mr. John Galsworthy. 
It seems to me sometimes that in the wealthier classes 
of our society there is less reading of any kind every 
year. 

There are, of course, other fields of literary activity 
than this of fiction. One of the most popular forms of 
recent years has been the semi-historical monograph, in 
which the writer takes some personage of importance 
in literary or other circles fifty or a hundred years ago, 
and rewrites the story of his life, paying generally par- 
ticular attention to those more human elements in his 
character which the old-fashioned official biographer 
was content to leave in the background. Some writers, 
as, for example, Mr. Francis Gribble, have established 
a reputation for work of this kind: their happy hunting- 
ground lies among the love affairs of the not too dis- 
tant past; they range from the shadowy (and shady) 
history of Catherine of Russia to that of the late Lord 
Byron. Mr. Gribble himself is perhaps the chief of his 
industrious tribe; he possesses a pleasing and caustic 
wit, and can conduct a post mortem on a desiccated 
heart as well as any man alive. I do not know that 
I have much personal predilection for books of this 
type, occupying as they do a position midway between 
historical documents and the chronique scandaleuse. But 
from the commercial point of view they do well. Hand- 
somely printed and adorned with a few photogravures 



from old pictures, they are sold to the libraries at fifteen 
shillings or a guinea net, and the more successful speci- 
mens bring in as much as three hundred pounds apiece 
to their fortunate authors. It is a sort of work that 
demands a certain amount of research: the writer must 
know the most likely quarries for his material. 

More serious biographies, even in recent years, when 
good biographies have not been too common, have still 
produced respectable rates of pay. Lord Morley is 
said to have received ten thousand pounds for his Life 
of Gladstone ; Mr. Winston Churchill, our present 
First Lord of the Admiralty, had eight thousand and 
a share of the publishers' profits for the biography of 
his father, the late Lord Randolph Churchill. These 
prices compare not unfavorably with the cheque for 
20,000 which Lord Macaulay received for his History 
of England, a sum of money which marked an epoch 
in the history of literature. 

The Minor Poet has always been the Cinderella of 
the literary family. But now and again, at intervals 
of ten or twenty years, there seems to sweep over the 
country a wave of poetic feeling: thin volumes of verse, 
tastefully printed, begin to appear and what is far 
more remarkable to be bought ; while the critics take 
on an unwonted vein of appreciation and gravely discuss 
the prospect of some of these young men reaching their 
(poetic) majority. There are actually one or two poets 
at the present moment who have attained to a certain 
sale. Mr. Alfred Noyes is one, Mr. John Masefield 
another ; these stand out from a goodly host of smaller 
fry. And we possess in England to-day an unusually 
large number of capable writers of light verse, of whom 
Mr. Owen Seaman, editor of "Punch," may be regarded 
as the chief. These merry jesters find a more ready 
market for their wares than their more serious brethren. 
Indeed, we live in an age which takes nothing more seri- 
ously than it can help. Great poets have seldom an 
acute sense of humor. If they had, it is probable that 
they would not write great poetry: they would be 
tempted to turn round occasionally and laugh at them- 
selves and their rivals, a practice that makes the 
reading public nervous and distrustful. The man with 
a reputation as a comedian needs not to consider his 
dignity: he laughs at everything, and the daily papers 
accept his jests with gratitude and at a reasonable rate 
of pay. I see it stated in the article from which I quoted 
above that really happy light verse is paid for at the 
rate of a shilling a word. I think the writer must have 
meant a shilling a line, but perhaps he had in mind 
some veritable lion of the profession. Sixpence a line 
is the ordinary rate for good light verse in most of our 
papers at the present time. It may not sound very 
much, but it forms a very useful addition to the incomes 
of young and struggling apprentices to literature who 
have not yet reached the Olympian heights of the big

A VICTORIAN STATESMAN AND 
REFORMER.* 



The great orator and statesman, parliamenta- 
rian and reformer, humanitarian and free-trader, 
whose life Mr. George Macaulay Trevelyan pre- 
sents in an ample volume of attractive appear- 
ance, is one of those characters that appeal 
unfailingly to the human nature in us all, and 
that we cannot read about or hear about too 
often. Sentences and phrases from John 
Bright's many public speeches have obtained 
currency by reason of their homely wisdom and 
epigrammatic force. " A free breakfast table " 
is as familiar to advocates of unrestricted trade 
between nations as is " the full dinner-pail " to 
those who profess to believe that the working 
man's welfare depends on a protective tariff. 
" You cannot get twenty wagons at once through 
Temple Bar," is remembered as the apophtheg- 
matic utterance of the member for Birmingham 
in withdrawing one bill in order to facilitate the 
passage of another. "Force is not a remedy," 
he declared with reference to certain disturb- 
ances in Ireland. 

A glance at the list of previous Bright biog- 
raphies shows that there is abundant room for 
such a work as Mr. Trevelyan's. The great 
work of Mr. George Barnett Smith, " The Life 
and Speeches of the Right Honourable John 
Bright, M.P.," in two substantial volumes, was 
issued eight years before Bright's death and 
confines itself almost entirely to the political 
and historical aspects of its subject, with but 
the briefest reference to the private life and 
personal characteristics of the picturesquely 
interesting Quaker manufacturer and orator. 
Other and more recent biographies are but 
short monographs or designedly inexhaustive 
treatments of the theme, and the ample collec- 
tions of Bright's formal speeches and public 
letters that have been issued do not go far 
toward supplying the need of a full and intimate 
biography. The present endeavor in that direc- 
tion does indeed result in the portrayal of a man 
who seems always to have been before the public 
and to have spent the best of himself in parlia- 
mentary activity, rather than of one with a rich 
and significant personal history that the reader 
would fain become acquainted with ; but we do 
get more of the man John Bright in Mr. Tre- 
velyan's pages than most of us already know. 

*THK LIFE OF JOHN BRIGHT. By George Macaulay 
Trevelyan. Dlustrated. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. 



The biographer's warm interest in his theme and 
the facilities afforded him for its adequate treat- 
ment are indicated in these opening sentences of 
his preface: 

" The pleasure of writing a biography id dependent 
on three things : the sympathy of the biographer for his 
subject; the interest of the new material which he has 
to handle ; and his relations to those who have honoured 
him by trusting to him the memory they revere. In 
all three respects I have been most fortunate, and wish 
to express my gratitude to the family and relations of 
John Bright, who have smoothed the path for me by 
forbearance, by encouragement, and by much active 
help." 

Entering his father's business of cotton- 
spinning, at Rochdale in Lancashire, when he 
was fifteen years old and had had seven or eight 
years of schooling in various educational estab- 
lishments of the Friends, John Bright continued 
the training of his mind by reading history and 
poetry, and by studying and debating the poli- 
tical questions of the day. A room in the upper 
story of his father's counting-house, as he has 
recorded, he fitted up as a study, and there he 
"often read a good deal before breakfast and 
was undisturbed." No strict conformity to 
Quaker rules was insisted upon in the family, 
and in the outside world the young man showed 
a pliancy and adaptability, in externals and 
non-essentials, that facilitated his rise to promi- 
nence in public life. In his thirty-fourth year 
we find him dropping the Quaker forms in his 
correspondence, except with Friends. Of his 
environment and his interests in early manhood 
we read : 

" Throughout the 'thirties the absorbing passion of 
these brothers and sisters was neither religion nor busi- 
ness, still less the forbidden dances and pleasures of the 
world, but politics. Preoccupation with affairs of State 
was then very uncommon among Friends; many were 
studiously neutral, many patiently Conservative, and 
many, like old Jacob Bright, were strong but quiet 
Liberals, neither speculative nor active in such matters. 
Ever since the death of Penn, the sect had avoided 
politics as being more beset with worldly snares for the 
children of light than the common business transactions 
in which so many of them managed to thrive without 
endangering their principles. Such seclusion from public 
life had been natural in former times, when power was 
monopolised by the landlord class and by the adherents 
of the State Church, but in the new and more liberal 
age now dawning, a closer relation to politics was to be 
expected in people so actively philanthropic as the 
Quakers. ... As the years went on, and drew John 
Bright deeper and deeper into a merely political life, 
these worldly entanglements evoked, as we shall see, 
much criticism from the older and more religious mem- 
bers of his society, including some who loved him best. 
But prior to his marriage in 1839 his interest in politics 
met with no such discouragement, for the family of 
which he was already the real leader was self-sufficing 
and saw relatively little of other Friends. The Meeting

at Rochdale was neither large nor remarkable, and the 
Brights of Greenbank were a law unto themselves." 

Thus, with his increasing absorption in public 
affairs, the significance of John Bright's life, 
as his biographer observes, " derives from ' the 
condition of England question,' as Carlyle in 
1840 dolefully called it, and in particular from 
those parts of the question with which Bright 
concerned himself as an agitator the landlord 
power, the Corn Laws, and the franchise." 
Although Bright's name and that of his famous 
co-worker and close friend, Richard Cobden, are 
deservedly associated with the anti-Corn Law 
agitation that eventually gave untaxed wheat 
and other cereals to the starving poor whose 
cause the two men had so warmly espoused, 
neither of them was, as a matter of fact, among 
the original founders of the Anti-Corn Law 
Association (organized at Manchester in 1838) 
which soon changed its name and became famous 
as the National Anti-Corn Law League. But 
Bright's name was in a short time added to the 
" Provisional Committee " actually a few days 
before Cobden's, Mr. Trevelyan says. Jacob 
Bright, John's father, pledged himself for fifty 
pounds on the first of those noted subscription 
lists that were to play so prominent a part in 
overthrowing the landed oligarchy ; and the son 
started a Rochdale Anti-Corn Law Association, 
chiefly of working men, and could boast of a 
petition " for a total, immediate repeal of the 
accursed corn-laws," with nine thousand seven 
hundred signatures, or those of " almost every 
male adult of the town." Such were the begin- 
nings of the movement that seven years later 
resulted so fortunately for the nation's subse- 
quent prosperity. 

About this time came the romance of the 
young reformer's life, his courtship of Eliza- 
beth Priestman, described by Mr. Trevelyan as 
of lively and open disposition, almost worshipped 
by the members of her family, and possessed of 
qualities that would have insured her playing 
an important part in her husband's life if she 
had lived. But she left John Bright a heart- 
broken widower less than two years after their 
wedding day. His second marriage, six years 
later, to Margaret Elizabeth Leatham, who 
"had inherited from her father a considerable 
portion," which, " at a time when the Rochdale 
business was a very lean affair, was a valuable 
help to her husband," does not picture itself in 
the roseate tints of the first love affair. But 
the well-portioned wife presented her husband, 
first and last, with seven pledges of her affection, 
and is said to have taken " a constant and sym- 



pathetic interest " in his work. She died in 
1878, eleven years before Bright breathed his 
last at the age of seventy-seven. One daughter 
by the first wife should be named in giving the 
number of his children. 

Mr. Trevelyan's famous kinsman, Macaulay, 
appears on the scene more than once, and not 
always in the most becoming of attitudes. For 
instance, after the Whig statesman had " in- 
censed the Leaguers because, while declaring 
himself a Free Trader, he urged the League to 
join hands with the Whigs on the fixed duty 
compromise, which he himself regarded, not as 
the best, but as the best that would be practi- 
cable for years to come," we find Bright writing 
to a friend : 

" Doubtless the Whigs hate us nobody denies it 
and yet what can be done that is not done ? Most of 
their hatred is laid to the charge of the Leaguers of 
Edinbro' because they bothered Craig and Macaulay, 
and yet I can see no wrong you did to goad on the 
shufflers. Macaulay came into the House the night of 
the Corn Law debate and laid [sic] down on a bench up 
in the gallery not far from the entrance into the Library 
and slept or appeared to sleep there I believe for hours 
the front Whig bench was wholly unoccupied during the 
whole night, and the whole question was treated by the 
Whigs and by Macaulay among the rest with the utmost 
contempt and doubtless his vote was only secured by 
your compulsion." 

Bright's position in regard to legal restric- 
tion of the hours of labor is made plain by his 
biographer, who insists that the great reformer 
never opposed the passing of laws to protect 
child workers from the cruelties of unfeeling 
task-masters, though in general he deprecated 
legislative interference between contracting 
parties, and "looked instead for an improve- 
ment of hours and conditions by agreement be- 
tween the employers on one side and adults of 
both sexes on the other." This confidence in 
the kindliness and fairness of employers and 
in the bargaining ability of the employed was 
characteristic of a benevolent manufacturer so 
wholly free from evil intent himself. 

With a parting glimpse of John Bright in 
his home and among his friends we will here 
take leave of him. 

" The life and conversation of which he was the centre 
at home or in the larger world was always simple in 
greatness, and truth was its keynote. He eschewed the 
small conventional falsehoods of which the rest of us 
are often guilty. He never strove to seem more friendly 
or more clever or better informed than he really was. 
If he did not know something, he would ask, without 
an attempt to hide his ignorance. If he did not like his 
interlocutor, the fact was usually apparent. . . . The 
interest of his conversation, apart from the terse vigour 
of his language, his humour, and his good stories, arose 
from the fact that he never said more and seldom less 



1913] 



141 



than the whole of what he thought about any subject 
or any person." 

The Oxford philosopher, T. H. Green, has called 
him "a great 'brick,'" and "simple as a boy, 
full of fun, with a very pleasant flow of conver- 
sation and lots of good stories." Caroline Fox, 
in her "Journals" speaks admiringly of his 
varied conversation and unreserved manner; 
"and then there is such downright manliness in 
the whole nature of the man, which is refreshing 
in this rather feeble age." These and other 
testimonials to the charm of his personality are 
to be found in the biography. 

Scholarly in its design and painstaking in 
its execution, rich in pertinent quotations from 
Bright's speeches and letters, well illustrated 
and carefully indexed, the book is about all that 
could be asked for in a biography of the Quaker 
statesman ; and the debt that America owes him 
for stoutly upholding the cause of the Union 
when other prominent Englishmen were express- 
ing sympathy with secession should give added 
interest to Mr. Trevelyan's work on this side of 
the Atlantic. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE BACONIAX HERESY.* 

What is the Baconian theory? "Sometimes 
we see a cloud that's dragonish," but the quo- 
tation is hackneyed. Ignatius Donnelly, besides 
claiming Shakespeare for Lord Bacon, says: 
" Either Francis Bacon wrote the Essays of Mon- 
taigne, or Francis Bacon stole the whole scheme 
of his philosophy from Montaigne." This dic- 
tum is accepted by Sir Durning-Lawrence, who 
also ascribes Burton's "Anatomy of Melan- 
choly " to Bacon. Mr. R. M. Theobald declares 
that Bacon wrote Marlowe ; Mr. Parker Wood- 
ward that he wrote Nashe. Other Baconians 
have given the greater part of Elizabethan lit- 
erature to Bacon. Mr. Castle says the plays 
were written by Shakespeare, assisted by a 
lawyer probably Lord Bacon. Mr. G. G. 
Greenwood prefers to attribute them to a Great 
Unknown, a lawyer, but not Lord Bacon. In 
a recently published book, Judge Stotesen- 
burg gives them to a syndicate including Dray- 
ton, Dekker, Hey wood, Webster, Middleton, 
and Porter, Bacon acting as a reviser and pol- 
isher of the joint performance. But this is not 
all. After the Baconians have gone to so much 
trouble and expense of spirit, Professor Celestin 
Demblon, of Brussels, coolly steals all their 

* THE BACONIAN HEBESY : A Confutation. By John M. 
Robertson. New York : E. P. Button & Co. 



thunder and wreathes the lightning crown of 
Shakespearean authorship about the head of 
Roger Manners, Earl of Rutland. The thing has 
become a screaming farce. Mr. Robertson, au- 
thor of "The Baconian Heresy," does not des- 
pair of seeing Queen Elizabeth, who was a good 
classical scholar and must have known consider- 
able law, championed as the true, Simon Pure 
poet of the plays. Probably a school of critics 
will arise in the future who can only see in the 
galaxy of the Virgin Queen and her mighty 
counsellors and starry poets, a myth, the forgery 
and coinage of some after poet's brain, like King 
Arthur and his Table Round, or Chatterton's 
circle of Bristowe worthies. 

Perhaps it might be well to let the Baconians 
mutually destroy themselves. Largely this is 
what has been done. Scholars have stood aside 
in amazement, disgust, and indignation. The 
Baconian books have been many and ponderous, 
from those of W. Henry Smith and Delia Bacon, 
the two "only begetters" of the craze, through 
Judge Nathaniel Holmes, Mr. Donnelly, the 
two Theobalds, Senator Davis, down to Judge 
Stotesenburg, with others too numerous to name. 
The Shakespearean side has been represented 
by very able men, Grant White, Edward 
Dowden, Mr. Devecmon, Churton Collins, and 
Andrew Lang; but, with the exception of the 
last-named, the attention they have given the 
matter has been brief, special, or by the way. 
Now, however, Mr. J. M. Robertson, who has 
already distinguished himself in Shakespearean 
criticism, comes forward with a book compared 
with which all preceding Shakespearean hand- 
ling of the matter is as a spread of appetizers 
to a banquet of seventeen courses. 

It is not an easy book to review. Mr. Robert- 
son's own part is written with uncommon vigor 
and wit, but probably half of the six hundred 
pages is a serried mass of quoted lines and words 
and parallel passages. We shall be reduced 
to statistics to give some idea of the length, 
breadth, depth, and all-satisfying completeness 
of its refutation of the most singular delusion 
of modern times. 

Nothing has done more to give color to and 
obtain credence for the Baconian theory than 
the asserted legal learning in the plays. Mr. 
Robertson shows that the law court was to the 
Tudor age almost what the newspaper is to-day, 
a source of general entertainment, a thing of 
universal interest. And not only did the people 
at large like to hear law cases, but they entered 
into them on the slightest provocation. Shake- 
speare's father was one of the most litigious of 



142 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



men. He was concerned in one way or another 
in sixty-seven cases. Shakespeare himself, with 
his property interests, unquestionably had much 
experience of law. 

The frantic prepossession of the Baconians as 
to the extent of legal knowledge in the Shake- 
spearean work is based on Lord Campbell's 
examination and judgment in the matter. He 
was not a Baconian, and his brief was written 
to substantiate the idea that Shakespeare might 
have been an attorney's clerk in his youth, an 
idea which we believe is probable but which his 
Lordship winds up by deeming doubtful. He 
declares that in fourteen of the thirty-seven 
dramas attributed to Shakespeare there is no 
trace of legal learning. As a matter of curi- 
osity, we abridge from Mr. Robertson a list of 
the number of law references in the other plays. 
" Macbeth " 1, " Merry Wives of Windsor " 3, 
" Measure for Measure " 3, " Comedy of Errors " 
2, "As You Like It" 5, "Troilus and Cres- 
sida" 2, "Much Ado About Nothing" 1, 
" Love's Labor Lost " 1, " Midsummer's Night's 
Dream" 1, "Merchant of Venice" 5, "Taming 
of the Shrew " 3, " All's Well That Ends Well " 
1, " Winter's Tale " 2, " King John " 1, " Henry 
VI." 3, "Henry IV." 4, "Lear" 4, "Hamlet" 
4, "Othello" 5, "Antony and Cleopatra" 1, 
" Coriolanus" 1, "Romeo and Juliet" 1. With 
some twenty law phrases which occur in the 
Sonnets, there is a total of about fourscore 
examples of legal phraseology and usage. 

The works of all the contemporary drama- 
tists, Greene, Nash, Dekker, Peele, Mas- 
singer, Heywood, Chapman, Ben Jonson, 
Beaumont and Fletcher, are strown thick 
with law words and law matter. In Lyly's 
" Mother Bombie " there are thirty law refer- 
ences. In Massinger's " City Madam " there 
are six, and in " A New Way to Pay Old Debts " 
thirteen. In Webster's " The Devil's Law Case " 
there are about thirty-five distinct legal phrases 
and references ; in his " Appius and Virginia" 
twenty-six. Ben Jonson's "Epicsene" has 
nine ; his " Devil Is an Ass " eleven ; and his 
" Magnetic Lady " forty. In all Ben Jonson's 
works there is probably four or five times as 
much law as in all Shakespeare's. None of the 
dramatists named is known to have been a law- 
yer ; nor were earlier writers such as William 
Langland, Chaucer, Spenser, and Latimer, who 
use legal terms glibly enough. Many of the 
Elizabethan playwrights show a special fond- 
ness for trials and scenes in court. Three of 
Webster's plays turn on formal law trials ; and 
Ben Jonson has a number of them. Most of 



these are more realistic, nearer to actual pro- 
cedure, than Shakespeare's idealized effects in 
that sort, which reach a sublime height of in- 
difference to true legality in the court scene of 
" The Merchant of Venice." Mr. Robertson 
gives an amusing exposure of the legal falsity 
of this scene ; but we think he hardly goes far 
enough. In the first place, Shylock's case would 
at any time have been thrown out of any court 
in Christendom. It was plainly murder, and 
no court or State would have authorized it. But 
if the bond had been allowed, then Portia's 
quibbles would have gone for nothing. A prin- 
ciple carries its consequences with it ; and even 
if flesh and blood are not one and indissoluble, 
Shylock was entitled to any means necessary to 
get his forfeit. Nor is there any reason why 
he should have been compelled to take his pound 
of flesh at one stroke. He could have taken 
less, or cut and come again, until he got the 
exact amount. Mr. Robertson notices the theory 
which considers Portia in the light of an Italian 
podesta ; but surely no podesta or English 
referee ever acted as attorney for the defence, 
judge, and jury all at once. 

The legal phraseology in the Shakespearean 
Sonnets is on a little different footing from that 
in the plays. In 1593 were published Barnes's 
Sonnets. Their similarity to Shakespeare's in 
many respects is remarkable, and it is difficult 
to believe that the latter did not read and imi- 
tate them. Barnes was a protege of the Earl 
of Southampton, as was Shakespeare. His 
sonnets are loaded with legal diction to an 
extent far surpassing those of Shakespeare. 

One more point may be noted in this legal 
controversy. Richard Grant White, the most 
absolute scorner of the Baconian doctrine, never- 
theless swallowed whole Lord Campbell's thesis 
as to Shakespeare's legal knowledge, and backed 
it up by some examples of his own. The chief 
of these is the Shakespearean use of the word 
"purchase," implying all means of obtaining 
property save that by inheritance. Mr. Rob- 
ertson shows that this was the primary and usual 
meaning, and gives 135 quotations from English 
writers, from William Langland to Beaumont 
and Fletcher, in evidence. He grows weary of 
demonstrating by piled-up proof that Shake- 
speare's usage of legal or quasi-legal words was 
on all fours with that of practically every other 
author of his age. 

The classical erudition of Shakespeare is the 
next matter which engages Mr. Robertson's 
attention. What air and water were to the 
physical life of the Tudor times, classical knowl- 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



143 



edge (often, indeed, intermixed with mediaeval 
matter) was to its intellectual existence. After 
the revival of learning, all Europe was saturated 
with the classical spirit. Particularly no one 
could begin poet without a stock of myths, leg- 
ends, commonplaces, drawn from classical an- 
tiquity. Without giving Shakespeare the benefit 
of any Latin School training at Stratford, or the 
"little Latin and less Greek" of Ben Jonson, 
it can be shown, as Dr. Farmer proved to the 
satisfaction of his generation, that practically all 
the instances of classical learning in his works 
can be traced to English sources. The contrary 
thesis, however, has been revived in recent times 
by two strongly anti-Baconian scholars, Pro- 
fessor Fiske and Professor Churton Collins. 
Mr. Robertson's demonstration of their error 
is as complete and brilliant as need be. Lord 
Penzance, who is the Baconian champion of 
their view, attached great weight to the opinion 
of Mr. Donnelly. Now Mr. Donnelly had no 
classical scholarship whatever. Dr. Theobald 
also follows Mr. Donnelly, and Mr. Robertson 
examines minutely the twenty-one examples of 
classic scholarship given by him. All of them 
are phrases, maxims, or references to myths 
which are to be found in English sources an- 
terior to Shakespeare. A book called "The 
Classical Element in Shakespeare " by another 
Theobald, a cousin of the former, is also ex- 
amined, and the sixty-four instances are simi- 
larly shown to be in wide use by previous 
English writers. 

In the matter of classical vocabulary, Mr. 
Robertson, quoting mainly from Judge Willis, 
gives an examination of 223 words alleged to 
show classical scholarship. As usual, previous 
English usage is shown for practically all of 
them. 

Coincidences of expression between Shake- 
speare and Bacon have been weapons most 
bravely brandished by the Baconians. Mr. 
Donnelly is amazed to find that such strange 
words as "quintessence," "eternize," "grav- 
elled" are used by both writers. Nay, words 
like " mortal," " ape," " infinite," " scour," "fan- 
tastical " are common to both ; as are metaphors 
about the sea, ocean, scum, dregs, clouds. It 
would be hard to find any writing where these 
are not common. Mr. Robertson gives many 
pages of quotations from other Tudor authors, 
where the expressions and ideas which amaze 
Mr. Donnelly and Dr. Theobald are existent. 

Owing to the lack of a concordance to Bacon's 
works it is impossible accurately to estimate the 
number of words used by him, or how they differ 



from Shakespeare's vocabulary. But Mr. Rob- 
ertson gives some partial lists which seem to 
show that the two vocabularies do vary greatly, 
as is but natural from their subject-matter, and 
that Bacon's is the larger of the two. 

The author of the plays shows practically no 
sign of Bacon's predominant interest in science. 
He was no fulminator against atheism, no zeal- 
ous flatterer of King James, no striver against 
scholasticism. There are but a few scraps of 
Latin in the plays, whereas in Bacon for many 
pages together Latin occurs continually and 
classical scholarship is predominant. Bacon 
spoke more than once in dispraise of stage plays, 
and the only kind of theatrical work he seemed 
to care for was the didactic. Acting as Com- 
missioner for Suits, Bacon declared against a 
petition of the King's Players, Shakespeare's 
company. 

In his comparison between the style, the 
manner of expression, of the two writers, Mr. 
Robertson opens up a new vein, one which we 
are surprised has not been worked before. 
What he says of Shakespeare's verse is fine 
and just. Shakespeare is the king of poetic 
rhythm, and he does with blank verse more than 
any succeeding poet has been able to do with the 
aid of rhyme and varied metres. His caesura 
flies from syllable to syllable, as the foam leaps 
from crest to crest to call the incoming billows 
to follow its plumed onset. Take only two 
lines for example, those of Coriolanus, 
" That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I 
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli." 

Note how the huddling rush of the first nine 
syllables is followed by the proud pause of the 
tenth, and then by the wavering motion of the 
second line, which answers in sound to the 
image. To compare such versification with the 
scant efforts of Bacon's wooden Muse is foolish. 
It is in their prose that we get the measure of 
their difference. Bacon's prose is static, Shake- 
speare's dynamic. Bacon's is bewigged, be- 
ruffled, formal, and ceremonious ; Shakespeare's 
is naked, lithe, as free in movement as a Greek 
athlete. For once we must part company with 
Mr. Robertson when he gives the superior meed 
of praise to formal, to so-called periodic, prose. 
And we must challenge his judgment when he 
declares that poets are not good prose writers. 
They are the best. Instinctively they put as 
wide a separation as they can between poetry 
and prose. They know that poetry is an expres- 
sion of passion and exalted moods, and that 
music in all the meaning of that word ordered 
movement, harmony, correspondence of rhythm 



144 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



and sound belongs to it and to it alone. They 
know that prose is the expression of ordinary 
life, that its norm is the colloquial. And they 
write or try to write a prose which, however 
brilliant and glittering it may be in its ideas 
and images, is yet as easy as an old shoe. In 
our language Shakespeare is the golden master 
of this prose style. Congreve is a near rival, 
and Dryden, Gray, Goldsmith, and Sheridan 
are great practitioners of it. After the eclipse 
of this style by the stuffed and stiff Johnsonian 
sentence, Hazlitt revived it, and from him derive 
all our later masters of light and easy prose, 
Macaulay, Dickens, Arnold, Bagehot, Steven- 
son, Birrell, and the rest. That easy, racy, 
idiomatic colloquial prose is the central prose 
we hold to be axiomatic ; but it does not follow 
that the other kind, the prose which tries 
to approximate to poetry, is bad. Only it is 
off the track, or trying to run on two lines at 
once. Of this style Bacon is by no means the 
supreme master that Shakespeare is in his. 
He has been far surpassed by later writers, 
by Jeremy Taylor, Milton, De Quincey, and 
Ruskin. 

So far in his book Mr. Robertson has been 
accumulating evidence, but in his final chapter 
he turns to argument and discusses all the prob- 
abilities of the case. Other writers have pre- 
ceded him here ; and though he handles the 
matter with great skill, so that almost any one 
of the points he presents is enough to carry 
conviction, yet the chief value of the book is in 
the original investigations of which we have 
tried to give a brief account in the foregoing 
review. 

In his preface Mr. Robertson makes a plea 
for charity and courtesy for the erring Bacon- 
ians. Yet, as he proceeds, their colossal ignor- 
ance and ineptitude for logic move him more 
and more to wrath, until he uses as strong 
expressions as we who are unregenerate could 
desire. It was an accusation against the old 
English witches that they removed the bound- 
aries of people's property at night, a most 
irritating proceeding. To wake up in the morn- 
ing and find that landmarks had been changed 
and woods and pastures which were in one manor 
or parish were now included in another, must 
have been destructive of all social continuity. 
The Baconians have essayed a like necromancy 
in the intellectual world. As the Shake- 
speareans do not call out for their punishment 
by the stake, the boiling cauldron, or the duck- 
ing pond, a few verbal ebullitions may surely 
be pardoned. C HARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



AN ARTIST IN THE SOUTH SEAS.* 

By temperament and education John La 
Farge was peculiarly qualified to appreciate 
and enjoy the charm of the South Sea Islands. 
Not only was he keenly sensitive to the beauty 
of the tropical scenery and of the rhythmic 
movements of the natives, whether dancing for 
his entertainment or following their ordinary 
avocations, but his remarkable freedom from 
race prejudice enabled him to meet these peoples 
with sympathetic understanding, to win their 
regard and to make many friends among them. 
Withal their leisurely ways appealed to him; 
for, though always a hard worker, he was one 
who never liked to do anything in haste. 

The visit to the South Seas which he made in 
company with Mr. Henry Adams in 1890 and 
1891 was of nearly a year's duration. It was a 
year filled with many and rare delights. Some 
hardships there were, for Mr. La Farge had not 
fully recovered his strength after a long and 
serious illness, and the fetes given in his honor 
were not infrequently protracted until they be- 
came for him extremely fatiguing. But aside 
from this and a few other minor drawbacks, 
none of which really interfered with his enjoy- 
ment, the experience was an enchanting one from 
start to finish. Nor was the impression made 
upon him by what he saw a fleeting one. Years 
after his return he was fond of talking for hours 
about the islands and their peoples. They had 
always fascinated him from the time when, as a 
boy, he had eagerly read the narratives of Cook, 
Bougainville, and Wallis, and had revelled in 
the tales of Melville and Stoddard. 

The record of this year of travel is in part 
made up from the diary kept by Mr. La Farge 
with a view to its publication, and partly from 
his letters to his son, Mr. Bancel La Farge. In 
his friend Mr. Henry Adams he had a thoroughly 
congenial companion. Both were content to 
journey in the most leisurely manner. And the 
reader who is content to read without hurrying, 
and to linger over the pages of this book, will 
find it most engaging. It is not merely a book 
of travel. It is that and something more. The 
style is contemplative rather than descriptive. 
There is much thoughtful comment upon the 
things seen, and much illuminating information. 
And there is rich treasure in curious tales and 
legends, all of them entertaining, and some, like 
"The Story of the Fish Hook War," highly 
amusing. A number of these tales were related

to Mr. La Farge and Mr. Adams by Queen 
Marau of Tahiti. This old lady, the head of the 
ancient house of the Tevas, graciously adopted 
her two American friends into the line by con- 
ferring family names upon them, and then made 
them acquainted with the heroic deeds of the 
great Chiefs of Amo from whom they might now 
claim descent. Then, too, the genealogy of the 
family was laid before them; and among the 
South Sea islanders genealogy indicated "not 
only one's importance but one's right to land." 
Of course the honor conferred upon Mr. La 
Farge and Mr. Adams was not intended to be 
more than a compliment; nor could it be, for, 
as Mr. La Farge tells us: 

" The entire aristocracy is a real one, the only one I 
know of. It is impossible to enter into it, though one 
may be born into it. With our ideas of more or less 
Germanic origin we suppose a ruler gifted with the 
power of bestowing part of his value upon certain men 
lower than himself and actually making such people 
essentially different. A Polynesian knows no such 
metaphysical subtlety. The actual blood of physical 
descent is essential to supremacy, except in a most 
vicarious and momentary manner, or as by marriage so 
that the children may become entitled to whatever the 
sum of the blood of parents represents." 

These words were written before the visit to 
Tahiti and were in explanation of the attitude of 
the Samoans toward the chief Malietoa, whom 
the Berlin Conference made king, and toward 
the deposed ruler Mataafa, who, because of his 
more distinguished pedigree must be regarded 
as the greater chief even though arbitrarily 
despoiled of his power. For Mataafa, Mr. La 
Farge entertained very high respect. During 
the months spent in Samoa they met frequently, 
and the American visitors were deeply impressed 
by the ex-king's intelligence and courtly man- 
ners. Mr. La Farge's words about him are 
worth quoting: 

"I see no picture about me more interesting than the 
moral one of my next neighbour the great Mataafa. To 
see the devout Christian, the man who has tried to put 
aside the small things that tie us down, struggle with 
the antique prejudices necessary ones of a Poly- 
nesian nobleman, is a touching spectacle. When a 
young missionary rides up to his door, while all others 
gently come up to it, and those who pass move far away 
out of respect; and then when the confident youth, full 
of his station as a religious teacher, speaks to the great 
chief from his saddle, Mataafa's face is a study. Over 
the sensitive countenance, which looks partly like that 
of a warrior, partly that of a bishop or church guardian, 
comes a wave of surprise and disgust, promptly repelled, 
as the higher view of forgiveness and respect for holy 
office comes to his relief. 

" But Mataafa is not only a chief of chiefs, he is a 
gentleman among gentlemen. My companion, difficult 
to please, says, ' La Farge, at last we have met a gen- 
tleman.' " 



The travellers' longest stay was in Samoa, 
where they made excursions in many directions 
and were everywhere received with warm hospi- 
tality. At each village as they approached they 
were welcomed by the Taupo, or official virgin ; 
and in spite of the disapproval of the mission- 
aries a performance of the sitting siva dance 
was usually given for their entertainment. Mr. 
La Farge has much to say about this dance, 
which is the Polynesian's natural form of ex- 
pression of joy in life. The lithe, rippling move- 
ment of the body is exquisitely graceful in its 
pulsing rhythm. Upon the American artist it 
made a deep impression. Seeing it danced for 
the first time he wrote : " The memory of all 
that beauty which we call Greece, the one beauty 
which is to outlast all that is alive, comes over 
me like a wave of mist, softening and putting 
far away into fairyland all that I have been 
looking at." 

In addition to the written record, Mr. La 
Farge used his brush and pencil assiduously to 
make a pictorial one, and the volume contains 
excellent reproductions of many of his sketches. 

It would be pleasant to follow the travellers 
throughout their entire progress, first to Hono- 
lulu and thence around the island of Hawaii ; 
next to Samoa, where they were paddled from 
village to village by native boatmen ; thence to 
Tahiti ; and lastly to Fiji, where, after an ex- 
pedition into the mountains of Vita Levu, the 
trip came to an end. But the reviewer can only 
point this out, and leave the pleasure to the 
readers of the book.

THE NEW ILLUSTRATED FLORA.* 



The natural history of a country passes 
through three stages. In the first, the period 
of the pioneer explorers, everything is new. In 
the second, knowledge accumulates, many books 
and papers are written, and the whole subject 
becomes too complex and difficult for one who 
has not access to large libraries and collections. 
In the third stage, a fairly complete treatment 
of the plants and animals emerges from the 
apparent chaos of diverse contributions and con- 
flicting opinions, and it is possible for the first 
time to see the whole field at a glance, with 
nothing of much importance for such a survey 

* AN ILLUSTRATED FLORA OF THE NORTHERN UNITED 
STATES, CANADA, AND THE BRITISH POSSESSIONS. By 
Nathaniel L. Britton and Addison Brown. Second edition, 
revised and enlarged. In three volumes. New York: 
Charles Scribner's Sons.

[Sept. 1 



omitted. In the first period, the main object 
appears to be to describe the newly discovered 
species. In the second, classification becomes 
as important as description. In the third, the 
broad outlines of the system having been laid 
down, and the accumulated data collected and 
arranged, the field lies open for biological work 
of all kinds. It is in the third period that the 
amateur comes to his own, and those who believe 
that it is good for many people to study nature 
must rejoice in the appearance of such works 
as the one now reviewed. 

The first edition of Britton and Brown's 
" Illustrated Flora" appeared in the years 1896 
to 1898, containing descriptions and illustra- 
tions of all the then known plants of the Eastern 
United States and Canada. It was very expen- 
sive to produce, and would hardly have been 
attempted but for the financial support of Judge 
Brown, who appears as one of the authors. Con- 
trary to expectation, the first edition of six thou- 
sand copies readily sold out, and the book was 
a financial success. This is a significant fact, 
showing that there are thousands of people in 
this country sufficiently interested in botany to 
buy a rather high-priced technical work ; and 
from the other point of view, that books of this 
kind can be safely undertaken by publishers in 
America as well as in Europe. It is probable 
that before very many years it will be possible 
to issue a similar illustrated Flora covering the 
whole of North America, and that when issued 
this larger work will also pay for itself. The 
time is hardly ripe for such a Flora at present, 
owing to our still very incomplete knowledge of 
the plants of many parts of the country. In the 
meanwhile, however, a condensed North Amer- 
ican Flora, without illustrations, is slowly ap- 
pearing in parts ; prepared, like the present 
work, at the New York Botanical Garden. 

When the first edition of the Illustrated 
Flora appeared, we supposed it nearly complete ; 
but the second edition contains more than 500 
species not given in the first, and in addition 
notes on a number of others considered more 
or less doubtful, or discovered too recently to 
be treated in full. The second edition also 
differs from the first in the names of about 
175 genera, necessitating new names for several 
hundreds of species. Of course many of these 
changes have been made in other publications 
between the dates of the two editions ; and in 
fact several, ostensibly new in the second edi- 
tion, were really published previously by other 
authors. When we consider all these changes 
and additions, and remember that in many ways 



the treatment is very different from that of the 
Harvard botanists, and even from the work of 
some of the other botanists of the New York 
Garden, it seems doubtful whether we have after 
all reached the third stage in our evolution. It 
is indeed true that we have not yet reached a 
condition of stability as to many names and 
details of classification ; but, on the other hand, 
the plant species are on the whole well known, 
and with the aid of such an excellent guide the 
amateur should have little difficulty in recog- 
nizing them. Fortunately, the pictures and 
descriptions are just as good, whether or not 
we approve of the names applied to them, so that 
the main object, the accurate recognition of 
the plants, is attained. 

There are times when one is half inclined to 
regret the existence of good botanical and zool- 
ogical manuals. These are when we find people 
wholly satisfied with them, looking for what 
is described in them, and looking no further. 
According to the way they are used, manuals 
may serve to bind or to liberate. They serve to 
bind and to hinder progress if they are thought 
of as covering the field, leaving nothing of im- 
portance to be done. They are, however, great 
causes of progress if they simply serve to make 
available the work of the past, so that upon it 
can be built the work of the future. We may 
judge that the first edition of the Illustrated 
Flora served in the latter way, as is shown by 
the great progress made since its publication. 
Nevertheless, it must be confessed that amateur, 
and even professional, botanists in America 
have not yet adequately realized the richness 
of the field before them. Once the species, in 
the broad sense, are sorted out and defined, all 
kinds of work on the biology, physiology, and 
varietal taxonomy of the plants may usefully 
begin. Of course work of this type has been 
carried on since the beginnings of botany in this 
country, but taken all together it does not do 
much more than open up the immense field for 
research. Perhaps the most fascinating subject 
of all is that of experimental breeding, to which 
Dr. Britton calls attention in his preface. Any- 
one who has a small garden, by concentrating 
on a single group of plants, can do valuable work 
of this type in the course of a few years. 

Condensed as it is, the Illustrated Flora re- 
quires three large volumes. Necessarily, much 
interesting matter had to be left out, but ,we 
regret the total absence of reference to several 
critical researches of recent years. This is 
especially noticeable in the case of the brambles, 
since there is a large blank space on page 275

(Vol. II.), where it would have been so easy to 
insert a discussion of the numerous forms re- 
garded as species by some and as hybrids by 
others. Misprints are almost lacking; and of 
positive errors, aside from matters of opinion, 
there are apparently very few. Zephyranthes 
is changed to Atamosco, but the derivation from 
the Greek given is that of the former name. 

It is difficult for those who use the book to 
realize the great amount of work it represents. 
The reviewer is old enough to remember when 
Dr. Britton was beginning his larger labors. 
Some day it will be told how he organized the 
great botanical garden in Bronx Park, and con- 
trived through it equally to serve the poor dwel- 
lers in down-town tenements, who flock there in 
myriads every week, and the highest purposes of 
pure science. There are very few in this world 
who can become great executives, and at the same 
time continue to do a large amount of original 
scientific work. In the midst of our work, we 
necessarily emphasize differences of opinion; 
but in due time, when the smoke of controversy 
has cleared away, it will appear a marvel that 
such a man as Dr. Britton existed, and was able 
to do what he did. T . D A COCKERELL. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. Winston Churchill's new novel, "The Inside 
of the Cup," offers an intensely serious treatment 
of an immensely important subject. As a novel, 
the charge lies fairly against it that the author is so 
weighed down with the sense of his mission and so 
zealous in the bearing of his testimony that he neg- 
lects art for the sake of didacticism, and fills the 
greater part of his five hundred pages with discus-

sion and argument that belong in a sociological or 
theological treatise, and have no proper place in a 
work of fiction. Having made successful use of the 
novel as a vehicle for historical exposition, he evi- 
dently thinks it may be used with equal fitness as a 
vehicle for the exposition of liberal theology and for 
the ideas that form the basis of the modern propa- 
ganda for social and economic betterment. In this 
belief, and in the practice which it dictates, he has 
of course, many examples to which he may point in 
justification. Anything may be put into a novel 
nowadays, and many readers have got into the habit 
of appraising novels with regard to their sheer 
intellectual content rather than with regard to their 
rhetorical equipment or to the success with which 
they handle the formal problems of character de- 
velopment and dramatic action. The intellectual 
content of this novel is substantial, and it has besides 
enough of the attributes of the novel as an art-form 
to lighten if not to enliven its somewhat ponderous 
progress. Mr. Churchill's theme is the relation of 
the church to modern life, and its thesis is that the 
church as an organization must frankly recognize 
that its old dogmatic foundations are no longer ten- 
able, and that it must rediscover and reassert the 
spirit of Christianity with little regard for creeds 
or formal doctrines if it may hope to survive. The 
cup must be cleansed within as well as polished 
without if it is to serve the true spiritual needs of 
man. The church must be converted from an organ- 
ized hypocrisy into an active agency for social wel- 
fare, and its inner motive of action must become an 
unshaken conviction that the essence of Christianity 
is the realization of human brotherhood rather than 
belief in any miracle or lip-service to any creed. 
John Hodder, Mr. Churchill's protagonist, is called 
from a sleepy New England parish to St. Louis, 
where he ministers to the congregation of a fashion- 
able church. Here the social problems which he had 
previously known only from afar are forced upon his 
attention, and he soon comes to realize that he cannot 
be a true shepherd of souls under the conditions 
which his vestry would impose upon him. He also 
begins to have doubts about the validity of the dog- 
mas in which his mind has been shackled, and a 
course of reading in the higher criticism soon shows 
him how artificial have been his theological beliefs. 
When the time is ripe, he speaks out, and the sermon 
in which he states his new convictions is thrown like 
a bomb into his congregation. The explosion dis- 
rupts the church, alienates the magnate who is its 
chief supporter, arouses the sharp antagonism of the 
vestry, cuts off his salary, and threatens a trial for 
heresy. Hodder stands firm upon his canonical rights, 
and refuses to be moved by the argument that he is 
violating his contract when he refuses to preach the 
doctrines which he has been engaged to preach. It 
is the old question of whether the church may best 
be reformed from within or from without, and Hod- 
der is resolute in holding it his duty to work from 
the inside. When the book closes, the threatened 
trial for heresy has been averted, and new allies have

rallied to his cause, but we feel that the struggle has 
only begun. Mr. Churchill champions the cause with 
such sincerity and force of conviction that we cannot 
hold its eventual triumph in doubt. It is evident 
that this book is a new " Robert Elsmere," but two 
important points of difference must be noted. So 
much water has flowed under the bridges during 
the past thirty years that in the depiction of such a 
struggle between reason and prejudice it is possible 
to blow a more resounding note of hope upon the 
slug-horn than Mrs. Ward's knight of the spirit could 
command at the forbidding portal of his dark tower. 
And the accent of the argument is noticeably shifted. 
It is no longer placed upon dogmatic theology, for 
the Zeitgeist has already brought that pretty well 
into solution. It is placed instead upon the mission 
of the church as a social agency, and upon its prac- 
tical rather than its intellectual derelictions. In 
taking this course Mr. Churchill is clearly the child 
of an age in which social sympathy is aroused as it 
has never been before, and, although the course takes 
him close to the reefs of sentimentality, he does not 
seem to be in danger of shipwreck upon them. 

Will the American civil war, we wonder, continue 
for another half-century to supply the romantic 
novelist with inspiration as abundantly as it has in 
the half-century just ended. The end of the output 
is by no means in sight, as we are reminded by 
several novels of the past year, and now particularly 
by Mr. Marriott's "Sally Castleton, Southerner." 
The type of this kind of novel is now pretty defi- 
nitely fixed, and the present example conforms to it. 
There is a dashing Union officer, and a patriotic 
Southern girl intensely devoted to the cause of the 
Confederacy. The girl loves the man against her 
will, and has to sacrifice something of her patriotism 
to rescue him from the fate of a spy. The scene is 
in Virginia, and the operations about Richmond 
supply the historical material. The outcome is the 
familiar one, and sentiment has the last word. 

A foundling adopted by a New England country 
physician is brought up as one of the family, and 
becomes the professional assistant of' his patron. 
He is given the name of Varge, and is devoted to 
Dr. and Mrs. Merton. Horace Merton, their degen- 
erate son, quarrels with his father, and kills him in 
a fit of passion. Varge thereupon, to spare the 
woman who has been as a mother to him, makes the 
preposterous self-sacrifice of assuming the guilt of 
the crime, and is sentenced to the penitentiary for 
life. His character and conduct are such that his 
custodians are convinced in their hearts of his inno- 
cence, but no persuasion can wring the truth from 
him. He becomes a "trusty," and wins the love of 
the warden's daughter. Then he contrives to escape, 
reaches the coast of Maine, and there unexpectedly 
encounters the fair Janet. She is ready to flee with 
him, and to share the peril and ignominy of a 
hunted existence, but he will not accept the sacrifice, 
and gives himself back into the hands of the law to 
save her from such a life. Finally, Mrs. Merton 
dies, the guilty son makes a confession and then 



shoots himself, and Varge is free to take up the life 
of freedom and love. It makes an interesting and 
even exciting story, but the reader revolts at Varge's 
indefensible and impossible heroism. Mr. Frank 
L. Packard is the author, and " Greater Love Hath 
No Man " is the title. 

" The Dragoman " is a piece of crude literary 
carpentry, but it contains a story. An Englishman 
who is the heir to large estates in Egypt, and who 
has lived on the Nile all his life, boards a nonde- 
script steamer on its way up the river, and learns 
that it is conveying a consignment of rifles and 
machine guns by way of the Blue Nile to Abyssinia. 
It is chartered by an American named Hilken who, 
with his beautiful daughter, is on board. There 
have recently been ominous suggestions of a native 
uprising and a holy war, which make Randall 
suspicious, and he learns that the arms are really 
destined for use in such an enterprise. This fact, 
and the possible fate that may await the American 
girl in the Soudan, determine Randall to take a 
hand in the affair. He is an adept in the native 
disguises and dialects, and he succeeds in imperson- 
ating the Egyptian leader of the expedition, of 
whose person he disposes in a highly ingenious way, 
taking his place on the steamer. It is a desperate 
adventure, and one does not see how he is going to 
get out of it, but his schemes prove successful, and, 
without revealing his true character to the girl, he 
rescues her from her villainous captors, punctures 
the revolutionary plot, and gets back to Cairo, where 
he reaps his fitting reward. The story has no style 
to speak of, but its movement is swift and spirited, 
its knowledge of the East adequate, and its out- 
come romantically satisfying. Mr. George K. Stiles 
is the author. 

Her real name is Stella Blount, but she is fancifully 
christened Stella Maris, because her room looks out 
on the English Channel, and the sea is her confidant 
and familiar. When we make her acquaintance, she 
is fifteen, and she- has never left her room, because 
she is the victim of a spinal disease which keeps her 
flat on her back. We are led to suppose that she 
will never leave her bed, which does not seem to 
promise well for the heroine of a novel. She lives 
in a world of illusion, created for her by the tender 
solicitude of her loved ones, who have so kept her, 
like lolanthe in the Danish lyrical drama, from all 
knowledge of the evil of the world, that sin and 
ugliness have no meaning for her. Chief among 
those who watch over her are two young men, for 
whom she is the centre about which the universe 
revolves. One is an actor, the other a journalist, 
and for the latter life has been made ghastly by an 
imprudent early marriage. His wife has developed 
from a shrew into a fiend, and just as the story opens, 
has been convicted for torturing a little maid-servant, 
and condemned to three years of imprisonment. Of 
all this Stella has no hint, and in the fairy realm of 
her imagination John Risca is a prince living in a 
beautiful marble palace which her imagination con- 
structs in detail from his description. Now this

situation is one that inevitably lends itself to senti- 
mentality of handling, and of sugary sentiment there 
is no lack in its portrayal, but somehow Mr. Locke 
keeps it from becoming either maudlin or mawkish, 
and develops it so beautifully that we come to accept 
it, despite an initial protest. About midway in the 
book, things begin to happen. Stella, growing toward 
womanhood, shows signs of recovering the use of 
her limbs, and after a year or so of convalescence, 
is restored to the conditions of normal existence. 
This requires a readjustment of her scheme of life, 
and an opening of her eyes to actuality. She learns 
all the wretched story of John's life, and has a hard 
struggle to preserve her mental balance under the 
shock. Meanwhile, the hideous cause of all this 
misery has served her term, and after her release, 
devotes herself with cold-blooded malignity to hound- 
ing John (who is still legally her husband) and the 
maid-servant whom John has rescued from an insti- 
tution and made his ward, and even Stella, whom 
she seeks out, and poisons with the foul effluvium of 
her mind. The creature is so steeped in depravity 
that it is hard to accept her as a human being. 
Finally, the little maid whom John has protected, 
and in whom he has inspired the most doglike de- 
votion, makes a great resolution. She will clear the 
path for his happiness by putting the horrible woman 
out of the way. She does this at the cost of her 
own life, because when the deed is done, she shoots 
herself. Then follow all kinds of heroics; the two 
young men, both of whom love Stella as a woman, 
indulge in the most approved style of Damon and 
Pythias performances, and at last the author, out 
of sheer wantonness, makes Stella choose the other 
man, although every indication of the story up to this 
time has pointed to John as the one to be rewarded 
in due time. We cannot forgive Mr. Locke for this 
breach of faith with us, which converts an appealing 
romantic action into a meaningless farce, and we 
refuse to take these last pages seriously. There is 
more substantial stuff concerned with motive and 
character in this book than Mr. Locke is wont to deal 
with, and, despite the interest of the present narra- 
tive, it is not as fine a performance as the works of 
whimsical intellectualized comedy with which he 
has hitherto regaled us. 

It was inevitable that Sir Gilbert Parker should 
write a novel about the war in South Africa. The 
greater part of his work has concerned itself with 
the British dependencies, and he is one of the most 
impassioned of imperial patriots. Popular opinion 
in this country on the subject of the Boer War has 
been so warped by prejudice and so poisoned by 
perverse fallacies that it is highly important to have 
the matter set before us in its proper light. Nothing 
could be more grotesquely mischievous than the 
notion that this war was an act of brutal oppression 
waged for the purpose of crushing the liberties of 
two weak and defenseless republics. Those who 
know the facts of its history understand well enough 
that it was a struggle in behalf of the funda- 
mental principles of human freedom, flouted and 



mocked at by a vicious and rapacious oligarchy. 
It was a war forced upon the English people by 
intolerable tyranny and wanton aggression. That 
Sir Gilbert makes this clear is a matter that goes 
without saying. We do not get to the war until 
"The Judgment House" is nearing its close, but the 
whole work leads up to it by an inevitable logical 
process. The hero is Rudyard Byng, one of the 
financial rulers of South Africa, who has returned 
to England and is occupying a conspicuous position 
in English society. He wooes and wins Jasmine 
Grenfel, an ambitious beauty who for his sake dis- 
cards Ian Stafford, the diplomat-lover to whom she 
has been engaged. After the glamour fades, she 
becomes unfaithful to her husband, and yields her- 
self to Stafford. Then the scene shifts to South 
Africa, and in the fiery furnace of the war the three 
persons chiefly concerned find their higher selves, 
and learn that life is something more than the 
gratification of petty ambition and personal desire. 
Stafford sees his sin face to face, and redeems 
himself from it by self-sacrifice and a heroic death. 
Byng, who never learns of his wife's faithlessness, 
regains her love by the splendid qualities of man- 
hood which the war brings out in him, and Jasmine, 
purified by suffering, makes full atonement for her 
lapse from virtue. It is all a little sophisticated 
and more than a little melodramatic, but poetic in 
exposition and romantic in emotional coloring^ We 
have given hardly a hint of the complicated plot, 
or of the tense dramatic situations in which the 
narrative abounds. Suffice it to say that all these 
things together make it a novel of enthralling inter- 
est, weaving many strands of intrigue and passion 
and heroism into its gorgeous pattern. In the matter 
of style as well as in those of invention and char- 
acterization, it stands upon Sir Gilbert's highest 
level of achievement. 

A novel of unusually fine texture and power of 
characterization is offered by Mr. H. F. Prevost 
Battersby in "The Silence of Men." It is the story 
of John March, an official of the Indian government, 
and Lynne Ashburton, a fascinating young woman 
whom he encounters on his return voyage from a 
visit to England. Lynne is going out to occupy a 
business position that she has accepted by correspond- 
ence, and when she reaches her destination finds 
that the firm has failed, which leaves her stranded. 
March, learning of her plight, persuades her to re- 
main, and make her home with him and his sister 
in the country district which is the scene of his labors. 
From this situation to a seemingly happy marriage 
the transition is not difficult. But the marriage is 
kept secret, and this enables Lynne, who tires of 
March and becomes infatuated with another man, to 
desert him, to contract a second marriage, and to 
return to England with her new husband in fancied 
security. March bears the blow in silence, and 
takes no step in interference. Returning to En- 
gland himself, he meets the right woman, and wins 
her love, but of course realizes that he cannot marry 
her. The complication is disentangled when it tran-

spires that the versatile Lynne had contracted a 
marriage in England previous to her voyage to 
India, and that the first of her three husbands had 
died between the dates of her second and third 
weddings. Thus the third marriage is manifestly 
legal, while the second is seen to interpose no obstacle 
to March's new-found happiness. This ingenious 
plot is enough in itself to make a good novel, and 
it is made a very good one by the author's admirable 
style, his powers of description, and his skill in the 
analysis of character and motive. 

"At the back of his mind there was an idea. 
What it was he never knew, because it never pre- 
sented itself to his consciousness. He only knew 
that it was there. It continually reminded him of its 
existence. In the course of ordinary conversation, 
or when reading a book, there was the insistence 
of the idea trying to find expression. It was as 
though something was continually knocking at the 
door of his consciousness for admission. But he 
did not know what it was that knocked, nor did he 
know how to unlock the door." We came across 
this paragraph in an essay in "The New Statesman " 
just after reading Mr. Charles Marriott's novel, 
"The Catfish." The paragraph was not written 
with any reference to the book, but it supplies us 
a characterization of the hero. The mystery of 
the title is not explained until the last chapter is 
reached, where we read: "At one time the North 
Sea fishermen brought their cod to market in the 
holds of their vessels. In the tanks the cod lived 
at ease, with the result that they came to market 
slack, flabby, and limp. Some genius among fisher- 
men introduced one catfish into each of his tanks, 
and found that his cod came to market firm, brisk, 
and wholesome." George Tracey, who grows up 
in an English provincial town, goes to London as a 
clerk in his father's banking business, and returns 
to his native town to establish a cooperative enter- 
prise a sort of department store on idealistic lines, 
represents the cod in this parable. Mary Festing, 
whom he meets as a child, is his catfish, and exer- 
cises a subtle influence over his life, even after 
he is happily married to another girl. He is an 
introspective youth, and is always busy with self- 
analysis, trying to discover why he does not see 
things with other people's eyes. He does not quite 
find out, but he achieves something like the sort of 
success for which he has been groping. The story 
is almost wholly devoid of exciting happenings, but 
it reveals to us a singularly interesting mind real- 
izing itself under commonplace conditions, and it 
has a quiet compelling charm that sets it high above 
the level of ordinary fiction. 

"The House of Spies," by Mr. Warwick Deeping, 
is a romance of the south coast of England in the 
days when the Emperor's forces massed at Boulogne 
threatened the safety of the island, and when the 
whereabouts of Villeneuve and Nelson were the 
subject of much anxious speculation. A fanatical 
English scholar, who has come to regard Napoleon 



as a champion of human liberty, and has conspired 
with the French to further their invasion, is the 
occupant of the old manor-house which the title of 
the book describes. Unfortunately for his nefarious 
designs, he has a pretty daughter, who is quite inno- 
cent of complicity in the treachery, and of whom a 
young neighboring squire becomes enamoured. 
There is an authentic villain of the best-approved 
type who has made the English scholar his dupe, 
and who is also an aspirant for the love of the fair 
Nance. How the squire thwarts his plans, and 
rescues the girl from his clutches as he is about to 
kidnap her and carry her away to France after the 
news of Trafalgar has made his plottings futile, is 
told us in thrilling fashion by Mr. Deeping whose 
skill as a romantic novelist we have had occasion to 
praise upon several previous occasions. We fear that 
the author is by way of being a cynic where women 
are concerned, for he says such shameless things as 
these : " Most women have a desire to dazzle and 
to devastate. It is the utter inability of the majority 
to do anything of the kind that gives such a feline 
viciousness to their morality." Nance, however, is 
an exception, for she is as dazzling and devastating 
as the most romantic taste could wish her to be. 

Swashbuckling adventure has given place to 
modern comedy in Mr. Justin Huntly McCarthy's 
" Calling the Tune." Wickliff Hersham, returning 
from South America to England after an absence of 
twenty years, has made up his mind to have a good 
time. He has the wherewithal, being possessed of 
a suspiciously-gotten fortune amassed in Buenos 
Ayres. His thoughts turn toward a friend of his 
youth, Gregory Winbush by name, who had been his 
rival for the affections of a certain fair Gondoline, 
and had carried off the prize. He is discovered in 
his secluded suburban home, where he is engaged in 
the invention of a stabilizer for air-ships, secretly 
conducting his experiments within a mysterious shed 
of corrugated iron. The Gondoline of their youth 
has long since passed away, but a second Gondoline, 
an exact replica of her mother, greets the surprised 
gaze of the returned wanderer. Upon her he 
promptly fixes his affections, devising for her a 
round of the gaieties for which she has been pining, 
and showering her with gifts. Then a young rival 
appears upon the scene, and it looks as if Hersham 
were to be discarded in his favor. But when he is 
unmasked as a secret agent of the German govern- 
ment, spying upon Winbush's secret, he is ignomin- 
iously routed, and the fair Gondoline yields to her 
elderly wooer. Her essential girlishness and up-to- 
date slanginess on the one hand, and his imper- 
turbable self-confidence on the other, make the 
pursuit and the capture highly diverting. The 
climax is inimitable : 

" ' Come, Gondoline, will you have a husband who is also a 
lover, pretty clothes, jewels, theatres, restaurants, travel, all 
kinds of good times. Think of the Minarets. Why, you can 
be the queen of Brindleaf , if you like. Will you marry me ? ' 
" Gondoline denied him as fiercely as before. 
" ' No, no, no ! ' she cried on a rising scream.

" As she uttered the third ' no ' she rose from her chair 
and threw herself into Wickliff 's extended, inviting arms. 

" ' Oh, Wicky,' she said, as she felt his clasp about her, 
' do you really think we shall ever be happy together ? ' 

" Wickliff answered cheerfully, caressing her : 

" ' Oh, yes, I think we shall. I'll see to that.' " 

Miss Beatrice Grimshaw has annexed a new coun- 
try to the kingdom of romance, an achievement for 
which we should be duly grateful in these days when 
the jaded literary palate welcomes anything having 
the flavor of novelty. The island continent of New 
Guinea is her chosen scene, and she writes of it from 
first-hand knowledge and with an unusual power of 
vivid realism. Her former novel, "When the Red 
Gods Call," was a work of almost brutal power that 
made an almost unpleasant impression ; its present 
successor, "Guinea Gold," has no less force, but is 
softened and humanized in its interest, besides hav- 
ing a well-developed plot. The hero is a Belfast 
engineer, out to seek his fortune in the gold-field, 
and armed with a manuscript, accidentally fallen into 
his possession, giving directions for the location of 
a gold-bearing reef in the savage wilderness of the 
island interior. George Scott takes two men into his 
confidence, and together they fit out an expedition, 
and are successful in their quest. The enterprise 
entails incredible hardships, and the struggle between 
man and nature has not often been described with 
such thrilling interest. The Papuan native, also, is 
made out of an ethnological specimen into a human 
being. An infinitely pathetic and alluring figure is 
that of Charmian Ducane, more sinned against than 
sinning, whose life has been placed under a cloud 
by malice and treachery, whom Scott rescues and 
loves, and who follows him into the wilderness to 
escape her persecutors, and whose death in the 
mining-camp turns his exultation to bitterness. The 
author is impelled to award her this fate out of con- 
sideration for a certain colorless Janie, who is left 
awaiting Scott in Belfast, and whose image in his 
mind Charmian completely displaces. After Char- 
mian's death, we are told that Scott goes back to Bel- 
fast with his gold and weds the forgiving Janie, but 
we refuse to believe it. The playful savagery of the 
Papuans and the physical features of their island 
are impressed upon us in unforgettable descriptive 
pages, and the white derelicts who people these pages 
are given incisive individual characterization. The 
book is one in which boys will find their account as 
a marvellous story of adventure, and in which older 
readers will find enough else of deep human interest 
to reward them richly for their pains. 

A new story of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that ex- 
traordinary adventurer whom the Baroness Orczy 
has created for the delectation of lovers of romance, 
will find a host of eagerly expectant readers. There 
seems to be no sort of a fix from which he cannot 
extricate himself, and one is kept guessing how he 
will do it (with the comfortable assurance that he 
cannot fail) until the end is reached. His exploit 
in "El Dorado" is the rescue of the dauphin from 
the Temple, which is accomplished with neatness 



and despatch. The rescuer gets himself into the 
toils, and how he gets himself out of them provides 
material for a most exciting narrative. Even the 
hackneyed nature of the material does not prevent 
the author from contriving a new plot with consid- 
erable freshness of interest. The secondary interest 
is found in a love-story in which sentimentality

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The poet- ^ e ' n tne Verv ver g e * 

naturalist ninety, has the great interpreter of 

ofSerignan. fa Q mysteries of insect life, whose 
"Souvenirs Entomologiques " are now first fairly 
getting themselves read, come into his own. His 
jubilee of three years ago was quickly followed by 
the long-deferred recognition of his merits as a 
writer, his books achieved a greater circulation in 
a few months than in all the preceding years, trans- 
lations began to appear in other languages, and now 
a devoted disciple has prepared a sympathetic and 
touching biography of the modest and gifted man 
who at last is hailed by the world as "the insect's 
Homer." In Dr. C. V. Legros's "Fabre, Poet of 
Science" (Century Co.) is presented a faithful 
account of that long life of poverty and struggle, 
and of passionate devotion to a beloved pursuit, that 
had so nearly ended without any adequate recogni- 
tion, from outside, of the noteworthy things accom- 
plished. In the nick of time the biographer has 
secured the cooperation of the aged naturalist in 
presenting to the public the vicissitudes of a labori- 
ous life of eager study, miserably-paid teaching, 
research pursued in the face of all but insuperable 
obstacles, and authorship engaged in with the scanti- 
est of encouragement from the book-buying public. 
The naturalist himself furnishes a short and char- 
acteristic preface, and Mr. Bernard Miall translates 
the work into English. Admirable is the picture that 
the book gives of sturdy independence, disregard of 
conventionalities, scorn of worldly honors, genius for 
solitude, devotion to an ideal, and power of 'unre- 
mitting toil at an ill-paid task. The name of Jean- 
Henri Fabre will stand high in the list of those whose 
compelling genius has defied adversity and glori- 
ously triumphed. In the richness of his sources of 
information the biographer has been fortunate. The 
naturalist's " Souvenirs " and correspondence and 
other papers have been freely drawn upon, and per- 
sonal intercourse with the master has secured many 
additional facts of interest and helped to correct a 
number of inaccurate reports that had gained cur- 
rency. The spirit and style of the work are worthy 
of its subject. Even in translation its felicities of 
manner give delight, as where reference is made 
to the veteran entomologist's junior admirers and 
friends, " young people with warm hearts and 
smiling imaginations, overflowing with that spring- 
time sap of life which makes us so expansive and so

eager to know." A few easily avoidable Gallicisms, 
however, are encountered in Mr. Miall's English, 
as " sensible " for " sensitive," and such a construc- 
tion as " Rembrandt, Teniers, nor Van Ostade never 
painted anything more picturesque . . ." In the 
last chapter there is some lack of correspondence 
between the numbered notes and the numbers in the 
text. A portrait from an apparently recent photo- 
graph helps to a better acquaintance with the extra- 
ordinary and pathetically heroic personality so well 
pictured by the biographer's pen so well because 
to the author's well-considered paragraphs there are 
added so many revealing passages of the great 
naturalist's own writing. 

Some fears and many prejudices will 
disappear after a careful reading 
of "The Jews of To-Day" (Holt), 
translated from the German of Dr. Arthur Ruppin 
by Miss Margery Bentwich, and introduced to 
the English reader by Mr. Joseph Jacobs, Litt.D. 
Carefully written from the fullest obtainable knowl- 
edge, every aspect of the modern Jew in all 
countries finds sympathetic presentation, with well 
digested considerations of his value to the world 
and his due place in it, now and in the future. It 
appears that the single million of Jews in the world 
at the close of the Thirty Years' War has now 
increased to some twelve millions, of whom two 
millions are in this country half of them in New 
York. Dr. Ruppin divides the race into four 
classes, the first and largest of which is untouched 
by modern culture and keeps itself as a nation 
apart; the second holds a higher position econo- 
mically, interests itself somewhat in non-Jewish 
literature, and modifies slightly the old ritual; the 
third includes the Jewish bourgeoisie in Europe 
and America, has a smaller birth rate, and keeps 
within the faith only in marriage and in occasional 
observance of ancient rites; the fourth comprises 
rich and university-educated Jews the world over, 
who are no longer of the faith and are on the point 
of merging themselves with the prevailing elements 
of population by marriage and baptism. The num- 
bers of each class are roughly estimated, respect- 
ively, at six, three, two, and one million. One 
reads that " In England and America anti-Semitism 
arose because of the great influx of immigrants who 
are used to a low standard of living, are content to 
work for a low wage and so undercut the wages and 
lower the standard of living of the native workman." 
Dr. Ruppin says quite frankly: "In social and public 
life the Jews are often charged with being presump- 
tuous and wanting in tact. This is very often the case 
in fact, but the reason is not to be found in their 
racial qualities but in the unparalleled rapidity of 
their social and economic advance, which naturally 
gives rise to this parvenu spirit." For the rest, it is 
said that the Jew in all ages has shown remarkable 
powers of assimilation with his neighbors, contrary 
to the general belief, and that for more than a century 
and a half has educated himself away from Jewry 



almost as rapidly as his bettering circumstances per- 
mitted his withdrawal from the Ghettoes of Europe. 
If numbers of his religionists and race rise far above 
the average in commerce, philosophy, and the arts, 
there are still greater numbers below the average; 
so that there is no marked difference, intellectual or 
other, between them and their non-Jewish neighbors. 
And that the Jew is a valuable factor in civilization, 
and in his fuller development a valuable addition to 
any population, Dr. Ruppin proves, we think, suc- 
cessfully, were these matters requiring proof. 

The mvtticai Miss Evelvn Underbill, whose recent 
beginning of work on " Mysticism " is probably the 
Christianitv. most comprehensive modern study 
written from a sympathetic viewpoint, has followed 
this with another large book, ''The Mystic Way: 
A Psychological Study in Christian Origins " (Dut- 
ton). Here Miss Underbill is on much more debate- 
able ground than in her previous book ; for while 
the only question to be raised about the former was 
whether mystical consciousness really led into a new 
realm or whether it was a merely subjective state 
with no reference to objective reality, the present 
book involves an interpretation of Christianity radi- 
cally different from that of the sociologically-minded 
investigators who would explain all its early phases 
in terms of group struggles and of class antagonisms, 
and also from the modern liberal school who put a 
moralistic interpretation on the work of Jesus. Miss 
Underbill's thesis is that Christianity represents in 
its primitive purity a new type of mysticism differ- 
ing from the Oriental, the Neoplatonic, and the 
Mahomedan. She quotes Professor Leuba to the 
effect that the mystic of this dispensation is "one of 
the most amazing and profound variations of which 
the human race has yet been witness." To make 
her thesis good, Miss Underbill has to show that 
Jesus himself, Paul, and the unknown author of the 
Fourth Gospel were veritable mystics, and that their 
records are records of mystical experience which can 
be checked up against later and fuller records from 
more detailed and verifiable sources. Her task is 
necessarily one of conjecture and interpretation, and 
its success will depend very largely upon the dis- 
position which the Higher Critics are likely to make 
of some of her sources. Of course Miss Underbill 
takes the Higher Criticism into account, and fully 
accepts its findings as to the composition and ages 
of the sacred books; but the skeptically-minded 
reader will feel, nevertheless, that she is too disposed 
to regard as historical the legends which fit the 
mystic character she confers upon Jesus. From her 
biblical survey, she turns to the early church and to 
the evidences of mysticism contained in the Catholic 
liturgy. In these it may be granted that the secrets 
of the " Mystic Way " are embalmed ; but it is the 
inevitable irony of mysticism itself that, to the reader 
who refused to see in this progress (granting a pro- 
gress from Jesus himself to the later mystics) 
anything objectively real, Miss Underbill could 
make no reply except the invitation to tread the

mystic way one's self the very thing that the 
skeptic could not do. And it must not be over- 
looked that Professor Leuba, whom Miss Underbill 
quotes in substantiation of the peculiar character of 
the Christian mystic, has himself recently analyzed 
those tendencies and laid it down that as soon as 
they show themselves in such forms as Miss Under- 
bill records they are no longer transcendental mys- 
teries but subject to the scientific analysis of the 
psychologist. And his own analysis of them leads 
him to find in them naught but projections of the 
believer's needs. 



Wonders of 
the seashore. 



A nature-study book from so experi- 
enced a naturalist and writer as Dr. 
Charles Wendell Townsend is sure 
to be well worth reading. "Sand Dunes and Salt 
Marshes" (Estes) represents the fruit of twenty 
years' vacation study of the varied phenomena of the 
seashore as viewed on the beach and in the marshes 
of the Massachusetts coast at Ipswich. Both the 
habits of the shifting sands and the characteristics 
of the animal and plant life of the vicinity are closely 
observed by Dr. Townsend, and his observations are 
recorded in a style attractive to general readers and 
by no means repellent to the specialist. Scientific 
names are relegated to the index, where they appear 
in parentheses after the more familiar unscientific 
designations. Illustrations, chiefly from the author's 
photographs, are supplied to the number of ninety- 
four. The twelve chapters of the loook treat of the 
action of the sand under the impulse of wind and 
wave, tracks in the sand, plant life on the dunes, 
land birds of the seaside, swallow roosts and swallow 
migrations, water birds seen from the dunes, the 
harbor seal, salt marshes and their past and future, 
birds of the salt marshes, the horseshoe crab and 
other denizens of sand and mud, and bird genealogy. 
Striking and interesting are the instances given of 
rapid changes in seashore topography under the 
action of wind and wave. But if one goes a little 
further southward from Ipswich and observes the 
sport which the wind has with the sands of Cape 
Cod, the impression is even more memorable. A 
good story with an obvious moral is that of the Coffin 
farm, as told by Dr. Townsend. Farmer Coffin, on 
his deathbed, bequeathed his estate to his sons, but 
bade them never cut off the wood toward the ocean. 
Disobedience was followed by the quick submerging 
of the fertile acres in wind-blown sand. As an 
example of the author's careful note of all things 
occurring at the seaside, mention may be made of 
his solution of the mystery of grass balls, such as 
puzzled Thoreau when he observed them on the 
borders of Flint's Pond in Lincoln. He also takes 
pains to ascribe the sand-dune spider's tracks to the 
male only, for the female abides at home. And 
the reptilian origin of birds he finds indicated in the 
quadrupedal movements of young herons before they 
have learned to fly, and in " the extension of the so- 
called thumb or bastard wing in the pigeon and other 



birds as they approach their perch." The book 
abounds in similar instances of suggestive note and 
comment. 

Mr. Amasa M. Eaton has brought 

Facts about together a wealth of information 
the tariff. e 

regarding the taritt in a small and 

readable volume which he calls "Protection vs. Free 
Trade" (McClurg). It forms an earnest attempt to 
enlighten the American people regarding the gross 
impositions that have been practiced upon them under 
the name of "protection." The author points out 
that free trade between the States of the American 
Union and free trade in Great Britain make the 
doctrines of Adam Smith and every other political 
economist of reputation a fact, and force upon their 
opponents the burden of proof to establish protection 
as anything more than a disproved theory espe- 
cially in the light of what it has done to the people 
of this country. He points out that "free trade," 
wherever spoken of, does not mean the abolition of 
custom houses, but the raising of revenue from im- 
ports in accordance with the practice in Great Britain 
and elsewhere, in such a way as not to confer special 
privileges upon natives of the country whose imports 
are thus taxed; the term is therefore synonymous 
with the phrase, "tariff for revenue only." He 
points out the enormous cost of protective tariffs in 
comparison with other means of raising governmental 
revenue, conferring as they do upon their benefici- 
aries a power to tax the people equal to from seven 
to twenty times the amount received by government. 
He quotes the highest constitutional authority to 
prove that any bill before Congress which contains 
protective features is introduced and passed in open 
conflict with the Constitution and in open violation 
of the congressman's oath to support the organic law. 
Without resorting to statistics that might tend to 
confuse, he makes the point clear that any pretence 
of the need for "protection " passed years and years 
ago; placing it as far back as 1812, though there 
is abundant authority to show that many industries 
still "protected" were self-sustaining before the 
Revolutionary War. Generally speaking, he treats 
"the American system " with the profound contempt 
that it deserves from thinking men ; he denounces it 
as immoral, antiquated, outgrown, at odds with every 
idea of freedom, and the well-spring of inexpressible 
and inevitable corruption, and leaves its advocates 
on the defensive from the introduction to the close 
of his work. 1

destroyed, as also most of that between the years 
1846 and 1868 ; but, as in the case of the Sibylline 
Books, what is now preserved will be all the more 
highly prized because of the loss of the rest. And 
perhaps we have fully as much as will be read and 
digested in these hurried twentieth-century days. 
Goldwin Smith belonged to the nineteenth century, 
especially to its middle and latter part, as Mr. 
Haultain remarks, though on some questions that 
closely concern us of to-day he expressed himself 
in no uncertain accents. Writing from Toronto to 
Mr. Frederic Harrison in the summer of 1902, he 
bursts forth: " Martem et Cir censes how they 
are trying to befool the people with military excite- 
ment and shows ! How great, one must sorrowfully 
add, has been their success ! We have had "a very 
painful revelation. . . . Things do not look well in 
the United States. They are getting more and more 
deeply entangled in the Philippines. This may, 
however, divert them from expansion southwards, 
to which the Isthmian Canal is otherwise likely to 
be a lure." It is chiefly with English affairs that 
the letters deal, and Englishmen of note make up 
the majority of the correspondents. The careful 
editorship of the volume deserves more than a pass- 
ing word of commendation. In the table of contents 
the letters are arranged chronologically, each with 
name of writer, name of recipient, date of writing, 
and number of page on which it begins. Useful 
footnotes are supplied, and a full index of subjects 
and personal names completes the book. Four por- 
traits, showing Goldwin Smith at different ages, are 
interspersed. These letters from his pen heighten 
one's opinion already high of their writer's 
vigor of thought and clearness of vision. Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. publish the volume, and it bears the 
title, "Goldwin Smith's Correspondence." 

Mr. Alexander Irvine's power of 
vivid narration is known to all read- 
ers of his autobiographic volume, 
"From the Bottom Up." A supplement to that 
appealing narrative is now offered in " My Lady of 
the Chimney Corner" (Century Co.), described in a 
prefatory note as "the torn manuscript of the most 
beautiful life I ever knew," the life of the author's 
mother. Very tenderly and touchingly he tells the 
love-story of his parents Jamie Irvine and Anna 
Gilmore. "The Gilmores lived on a farm near 
Crumlin in County Antrim," and Jamie was a jour- 
neyman shoemaker ; and, as he afterward expressed 
it, " I know'd frum th' minute I clapped eyes on 'er 
that she was the finest wuman on God's futstool!" 
The two were rich in nothing but love and children, 
of whom four died in childhood. Alexander was 
the ninth, born with a caul and so destined to have 
good luck. When times were especially hard 
and they seem rarely to have been anything else 
Anna would help her husband at his work. " There 
were things in cobbling she could do as well as 
Jamie. Her defense of doing it in the early hours 
of the Sabbath was : ' Sure God has more important

work to do than sit up late to watch us mend the 
boots of the poor; forby it's better to haave y're 
boots mended an' go to church than to sit in th' 
ashes on Sunday an' swallow the smoke of bad 
turf.'" "Aye," Jamie would answer, "it's jist 
wondtherful what we can do if we haave th' right 
kind ov a conscience!" The simple faith of the 
mother, her love for her dear ones, the author's 
devotion to her, and all the homely details of their 
family and village life, are frankly narrated without 
even any changing of proper names, as the writer 
assures his readers. The boy's call to become a 
preacher and missionary, his return to deliver a lec- 
ture on "England in the Soudan "in the only hall 
of his native village, his departure for America with 
the blessing of the mother he was never to see again 
much of this is at least partly known to those who 
have already interested themselves in Mr. Irvine. 
His closing account of his going back to Antrim 
after fifteen years, and what there befell him, forms 
a fitting conclusion to the little history. 

Stimulating Those of the cynics who are not too 
essays on life cynical will find a book to gloat 
and knowledge. over m Mr William Arkwright's 
"Knowledge and Life" (Lane). Unlike most 
volumes of essays and sketches, it is not made up 
mainly of reprinted matter ; only two of the eighteen 
titles have previously appeared. The first and the 
last, "The Tree of Knowledge" and "The Tree of 
Life," are really notable as well as immensely clever. 
One of the keenest, wittiest, wisest remarks of our 
decade is this : " Again, as ' in prosperity of summer ' 
the female green-flies, without male assistance, pro- 
duce an ephemeral offspring, so from a redundant 
curriculum do parthenogenetic writings make their 
appearance in greater numbers than those that are 
legitimately begotten. Wherefore, doubtless, each 
callow aspirant nowadays possesses droves of osten- 
tatious phrases, and is waiting for thoughts with 
which to fertilize them only as a rule he tires of 
waiting, and rushes into print." Seldom does a sci- 
entific analogy so perfectly point literary criticism. 
"The Thief," a lampoon on old-time Calvinism, 
stabs a thing that perhaps is gasping its last breath, 
but which cannot have too many murderers. The 
three stories told by an ant, though illustrating a 
rather worn method of satire, are nevertheless dis- 
tinctive and piquant. The biological pathos of the 
last story, told just before the nuptial flight and pre- 
destined death, gives the series artistic finish, 
sharpened, it must be said, with some emerystone 
from Shavian misogamy. In fact, Woman and the 
Church, two fairly old and fairly stable institutions, 
come in for repeated thrusts, "The Bambino" being 
one of the best ecclesiastical heresies. " An Appre- 
ciation" indicates Buddhistic sympathies. "From 
an Old Diary" convinces a reader already nearly 
persuaded that Mr. Arkwright is a writer of much 
polish and skill, who has succeeded in waiting until 
some of his fine phrases have been fertilized by 
thought.

NOTES. 



" Westways," Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's forthcoming 
novel, is a story of country life in Middle Pennsylvania 
during the fifties. 

" Loiterer's Harvest " is the happy title chosen by 
Mr. E. V. Lucas for his new volume of essays, to be 
published by the Macmillan Co. 

A second series of Mr. W. J. Lawrence's scholarly 
work, "The Elizabethan Playhouse and Other Studies," 
is announced by J. B. Lippincott Co. 

" The Rise of the Novel : Johnson and his Circle " is 
the general subject of the forthcoming tenth volume of 
the " Cambridge History of English Literature." 

A study of " Beaumont the Dramatist " by Professor 
Charles Mills Gayley of the University of California, 
is in preparation for autumn publication by the Century 
Co. 

A collection of Shakespearean studies by Professor 
Brander Matthews is announced for early issue by 
Messrs. Scribner in a volume entitled " Shakspere as 
a Playwright." 

Three important literary biographies announced for 
autumn publication by the Macmillan Co are Sir Sidney 
Colvin's " Keats," Mr. Francis Watts's " Robert Louis 
Stevenson," and the Earl of Lytton's " Bulwer Lytton." 

An anthology in a unique field has been made by 
Mrs. John Crosby Brown, and will be published by 
Messrs. Putnam. The book is a collection of dedicatory 
forms used from the early days of bookmaking to the 
present time. 

" The Poem-Book of the Gael," a volume of transla- 
tions from Irish Gaelic poetry into English prose and 
verse, as selected and edited by Miss Eleanor Hull, is 
an interesting autumn announcement of Messrs. Browne 
& Howell Co. 

" Our Eternity," by M. Maeterlinck, to be published 
this year by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. in Mr. Alex- 
ander Teixeira de Mattos's authorized translation, is de- 
scribed as " an inquiry into the nature of the possibilities 
of the hereafter." 

Miss Rosa Mayreder's " A Survey of the Woman 
Problem," soon to be published by the George H. Doran 
Co., has attracted marked attention in the German 
original as one of the most radical discussions of the 
feminist movement yet written. 

" The Power of Ideals in American History," by Pro- 
fessor Ephraim D. Adams, is announced by the Yale 
University Press. The book is founded on the Dodge 
Lectures on the Responsibilities of Citizenship delivered 
by the author at Yale last spring. 

Three promising volumes of personal reminiscences 
on Messrs. Scribner's autumn list are Mrs. John A. 
Logan's " Reminiscences of a Soldier's Wife," Senator 
Henry Cabot Lodge's " Early Memories," and Admiral 
George Dewey's Autobiography. 

Lord Alfred Douglas is writing a book on " Oscar 
Wilde and Myself." It will deal critically with Wilde's 
work; but it will also contain a good deal of informa- 
tion, and many anecdotes, sayings, facsimile letters, and 
illustrations never before published. 

Three novels to be issued almost immediately by the 
John C. Winston Co. are "The Man Who Saw Wrong" 
by Mr. Jacob Fisher, " Fanny of the Forty Frocks " by 
Frances Aymar Mathews, and "The Fate of Felix 
Brand " by Mrs. Florence Finch Kelly. 



A region comparatively little known to the tourist, 
yet exceptionally interesting and picturesque, is de- 
scribed in Miss Virginia W. Johnson's "Two Quaint 
Republics: Andorra and San Marino," which Messrs. 
Dana Estes & Co. will publish immediately. 

Dr. David Starr Jordan's forthcoming volume, " War 
and Waste," is described by its publishers as " not an 
ethical tirade on the wickedness and the futility of war, 
but a hard-headed business discussion of the financial, 
moral, and biological wastes that are caused by it." 

Some forthcoming volumes of exceptional literary 
interest in Messrs. Holt's " Home University Library " 
are Mr. H. N. Brailsford's " Shelley, Godwin, and their 
Circle," Mr. Glutton Brock's " William Morris and his 
Circle," and Professor Gilbert Murray's " Greek 
Literature." 

A study of " Elizabethan Rogues and Vagabonds and 
their Representation in Contemporary Literature," by 
Mr. F. Aydelotte, is announced by the Oxford University 
Press. This house has also in preparation a complete 
edition of Henry Vaughan's poetical works, edited by 
Mr. L. C. Martin. 

Mr. Daniel R. Williams, who accompanied the Philip- 
pine Commission headed by Mr. Taft on its tour of the 
islands, has prepared an account of his experiences and 
impressions and conclusions, which Messrs. McClurg & 
Co. will publish under the title, "The Odyssey of the 
Philippine Commission." 

The first three issues in " The National Social Science 
Series " will be " The Family," by Professor John M. 
Gillette, of the University of North Dakota; "Money," 
by Dr. William A. Scott, Director of Course in Com- 
merce and Professor of Political Economy, University 
of Wisconsin; and "Taxation," by Mr. C. B. Fillebrown, 
President of the Massachusetts Single Tax League. 

The important series of " American Crisis Biog- 
raphies," which Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. have 
had in course of publication for some time, will be 
brought to a conclusion during the next few months 
with volumes on Raphael Semmes, Ulysses S. Grant, 
and Daniel Webster, the work, respectively, of Mr. 
Colyer Meriwether, Professor Franklin S. Edmonds, 
and Professor Frederic A. Ogg. 

" The greatest figure in German politics since Bis- 
marck " is the London " Nation's " characterization of 
August Bebel, the German Socialist who died in Zurich, 
Switzerland, on August 13. Born in Cologne in 1840, 
his childhood and youth were passed in dire poverty. 
His political life began in the sixties with a phase of 
Liberalism, but association with Liebknecht soon made 
a Socialist of him. In 1867 he was elected to the North 
German Parliament, and four years later to the new 
German Reichstag. With Liebknecht, he stood alone in 
opposing the Franco-German war-loans and the annex- 
ation of Alsace, an act of daring which brought him his 
first imprisonment on a charge of high treason. He 
came out of prison a popular hero, and in 1875 founded 
modern German Social Democracy. There followed 
internal conflicts with the anarchists and the revisionists, 
but Bebel triumphantly defended his central doctrine, 
and with consummate leadership kept his great and 
ever-growing party together. Among his numerous 
writings are the following: " Christentum und Sozial- 
ismus," " Charles Fourier," " Die Frau und der Sozial- 
ismus," and " Die Sozialdemokratie und das allgemeine 
Wahlrecht." His autobiography has recently been pub- 
lished in an English translation entitled "My Life."

[Sept. 1 



The death of a distinguished author and librarian is 
reported from Orchard Park (near Buffalo), the sum- 
mer residence of Josephus Nelson Larned, long asso- 
ciated with the educational and library interests of his 
adopted American home. Born at Chatham, Ontario, 
May 11, 1836, Mr. Larned was educated in Buffalo, 
served on the staff of " The Express " of that city from 
1859 to 1872, was superintendent of Buffalo public 
schools, 1872-3, head of the public library, 1877-97, 
President A. L. A., 1893-4, and from about forty years 
of age was a prolific writer and editor of books. His 
" Talks about Labor " appeared in 1877, his valuable 
and now all but indispensable " History for Ready 
Reference " in 1895 (with supplementary volumes in 
1901 and 1910), his "Talk about Books" in 1897, 
" History of England for Schools " in 1900, " A Multi- 
tude of Counsellors " in the following year, " Primer of 
Right and Wrong " the year after that, " History of 
the United States for Secondary Schools " in 1903, 
"Seventy Centuries A Survey" in 1905, "Books, 
Culture, and Character" the next year, and in 1911 
" A Study of Greatness in Men " and a " History of 
Buffalo." He also edited " The Literature of American 
History" (1902). Earnestness, thoroughness, a schol- 
arly mind, a command of historical knowledge, and, 
from first to last, a noble purpose and a high ideal, were 
his. His death occurred August 15.

In Early Memories 

A Volume of Biography and 
Reminiscence 

Senator Lodge 

Recalls a Boyish View of Sumner 
Just Before the War 

His father raised him to a terrace 
coping before the State House. 

" Presently an open carriage drove 
up with some gentlemen seated in it 
and stopped near the spot where I 
was placed. Then a tall man, who 
I knew was Mr. Sumner, stood up 
in the carriage, and at the sight of 
him a shout rose from that crowd 
the like of which I have never heard 
since, and I have heard, in the course 
of my life, many crowds, and some 
mobs, cheer and yell. Then memory 
drops the curtain and I remember 
no more." 

This is an example of the innumer- 
able significant scenes upon which 
the distinguished author throws the 
light of his memory. Few men of 
the day have had a life so full of 
rich experience as that which he 
here recounts up to his early days 
in Congress.

Merrilie Dawes 

A Love Story that Develops 

Through the Exciting Incidents

American readers have long felt 
that a vital modern novel would 
have to fall within the great modern 
arena of industrialism : since that 
is the field that invites the strongest 
natures, there must be played the 
poignant human dramas. 

Mr. Spearman has revealed such 
a drama in a novel that tingles with 
life. "Merrilie Dawes" is a love 
story that turns upon a conflict of 
financial interests which ends in 
pitched battle in Wall Street.

Early in the story you get this 
glimpse of the singular 'personality 
of Lord Bendish : 

"A marble-faced young man 
with a dark head of curly hair and 
intensely dark eyes lay absorbed 
upon the sofa. Every feature of him 
was as sharp and still as statuary ; if 
he assumed rapture in his work, he 
assumed it well. Enveloped in a 
white Turkish gown, he was writing, 
with his knees for desk. Open books 
were strewn about him ; he blew 
and sucked at a water-pipe which 
stood in visible commotion upon 
the floor beside him. He was very 
handsome ; and sublimely uninter- 
ested in his visitor, although at the 
same time acutely aware of him."

M. Bazin tells a different story of 
French life from the popular one 
that turns upon intrigue. He says : 

" Our novelists, by occupying 
themselves with this unrepresen- 
tative part too exclusively, have 
created and spread a conception of 
our country which is not only inade- 
quate, but is also essentially false. 
If I have held myself resolutely 
aloof from the society novel, which 
I might have done, perhaps, as well 
as another, it is because I desire to 
portray the sweetness, purity, and 
beauty of French family life, and not 
to perpetrate a gross libel upon it."

By RIDGWELL CULLUM, author of " The Night Riders," "The Watchers of the Plains," "The 
Trail of the Axe," etc. 12 mo. Cloth. Illustrated. $1.25 net ; by mail, $1.40 

A big story of a Montana mining camp, in which the friendship between men and a man's love for helpless 
children bear a large part. It is full of the action which is characteristic of the tense life that these rough men 
lead, and yet there is all through the story the pathetic simple romance of Scipio, and the delicious humor 
furnished by the twins and by the miners' well-meant but inexperienced efforts to care for them. The story of 
Wild Bill's fight with James is one of the most thrilling episodes Cullum has ever produced and is a veritable 
masterpiece of vivid description. 

" This author's gift for narration is even surpassed by his power in character drawing. In this he succeeds 
remarkably well, his characters being individuals rather than 'types.'" The Louisville Courier- Journal. 

"Let any fiction reader take up a volume by Kidgwell Cullum, and he will not be disappointed." Columbus 
News. 

" He has the art of story telling at his finger tips." Nashville American. 

" He has a deep fund of humor and an unusual eye for color and realism." Poet Lore.

A novel of to-day, with a thrillingly intense love story running through it, in which the higher woman in 
Diantha King is brought out by her love for a man who had been tempted, had fallen, repented, and then risen 
again to the very loftiest manhood. Our old friend Sis, whom we all loved so in " Jinks' Inside," is the central 
figure in this story and we watch with interest and sympathy her development from her first explosive words of 
the opening chapter until, after many ups and still more downs, she at last comes into her own, a very beautiful 
own, and one well worth waiting for. The book is full of humor and also contains some really remarkable 
revelations of the occult.

This story of a hunting trip through the untraveled regions of the Yukon country gives accounts of the 
wonders of that mountain world, of the stalking of big game, and of the brave, hardy people who live there 
waging constant war with the forces of nature. The pursuit of the wild is the lure which induces the hunter 
to undergo the severe hardships exposure to the elements, climbing mountains, fording rivers, etc., but what 
really interests him, as they do all of us, are the people with whom he comes in contact. The stories of these 
persons, to whom deeds of heroism are everyday experiences, who live in isolated sections and win their livelihoods 
from the mountains, are overflowing with dramatic interest. All lovers of outdoors will enjoy the book.

This volume tells the stories of the most romantic events 
which were important in shaping the course of our country's 
history, and shows of what heroic stuff our men were made, and 
their conduct in precarious situations. Some of the subjects 
dealt with are " The Conspiracy of Aaron Burr," " The Pig That 
Almost Caused a War," "Decatur and the Barbary Pirates," 
" Lovejoy's Printing Press," " How Marcus Whitman Saved 
Oregon," " Lewis and Clark, Pathfinders of the West," "Com- 
modore Perry's Visit to Japan," " John Brown's Raid," ' ' Return 
of the Lost Children," "The Mormon Trail to Utah," "The

Adventures in the Alps 

By ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL KNOWLES, author of 
' 'Joselyn Vernon, ' ' etc. 12 mo. Cloth. Fifteen half- 
tone illustration*. $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65 

The lure of the mountains is in this volume ; it is so con" 
tagious that it transfers itself from author to reader, making the 
one almost as enthusiastic as the other. This is not a guide- 
book, or a history of climbing, or a record of personal experi- 
ences, although it may partake of all of these. It aims simply to 
picture some of those things which make Switzerland so beauti- 
ful and fascinating, and to enable one to enter into " the treas 
ures of the snow."

CHICAGO AND THE OLD NORTHWEST, 1673-1835 By MILO M. QUAIFB 

This book is in scope and subject-matter a history. But in language and content it is as thrillingly interesting as romance. 
It is a history of the founding of old Port Dearborn at the mouth of the Chicago River at the time when the modern metropolis of 
Chicago was but a wilderness hunted over by Indians. It describes the " Fort Dearborn massacre," the contest of the British and 
Americans for the Indian trade of the great Northwest, and the Indian wars, massacres, and frontier experiences which figured in 
the development of Chicago. The work is the most absorbingly interesting contribution to the history of the Northwest that has 
appeared in years and contains much new material of great importance.

LONDON IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 

of Chicago 

The purpose of this book is new, namely : to give an idea of London atmosphere in the various literary periods, to expound 
the chief places of interest for successive generations, and to make a reasonably generous selection from old and new engravings 
and photographs. It seeks to make clear to the average and casual reader the allusions with which English literature is filled. 
The chapters are devoted successively to the London of Chaucer, Shakespere, Milton, Dryden, Addison, Johnson, Lamb and 
Byron, Dickens, Victorian London, and contemporary London. A list of illustrative readings is appended to each chapter. 
There are an appendix on illustrative novels, a complete index, and 40 full-page illustrations.

A MANUAL FOR WRITERS By JOHN M. MANLY and JOHN A. POWELL 

A book designed to aid authors and all others who are concerned with the writing of English. It aims to answer the practi- 
cal questions that constantly arise in the preparation of manuscripts for the printer, business letters, and any sort of composition 
where correctness of form is an important element. 

It treats in a clear and convenient way the matters of grammar, spelling, and general form which writers need most to be in- 
formed about, and gives full directions on the preparation of " copy " for the printer and the correcting of proof. The chapter on 
letter-writing is unique and gives just the help that is constantly wanted and that other manuals deny.

Gavest 

Me 

Being the Story of 

MARY O'NEILL, 

Will be more widely discussed than 
any novel in recent years. Hall 
Caine has possibly the largest audi- 
ence of any living English author. 
In the startling revelations of Mary 
O'Neill he has conceived a deeply 
moving romance that will appeal to 
people in every walk of life. It is 
the story, told in autobiographical 
form, of a beautiful, pure and exqui- 
site woman who goes through some 
of the most terrible tests which the 
responsibilities of marriage bring 
into life. The problems of marriage 
and divorce have never before been 
so humanly pictured.

The increased volume of busi-

NEALE'S FOR SEPTEMBER 

Besides the regular departments, The Fraternity of the Fields, which is intended to be the 
eyes and ears of him who may not be with Nature in her many moods, conducted by an eminent writer; 
The Stage, a department of brilliant, trenchant, fearless criticism of plays, actors, and dramatists, 
conducted by a distinguished critic; Letters to the Editors, in which correspondents discuss among 
themselves topics of interest; In Motley, a department of wit and humor, not mere jokes, but pointedness, 
directed chiefly at persons in the limelight; Editorial Comments, in which all sorts of subjects will be 
treated, now seriously, now lightly, yet always vigorously, fearlessly, and independently, besides these 
regular departments and the serials now running, the September number, among many interesting features, 
contains noteworthy contributions to general literature as follows: 

The Walls Of ConcameaU By George K. Baker 

The first instalment of this novel, which will run serially for twelve months, is published in the 
September number. Broidered on the historical fabric of the struggle of the devoted Bretons who in 
1489 held Brittany against the French for the young Duchess Anne, this story keeps the reader alert, with 
eyes wide and ears open, and the close, wild warfare of the 15th century, with all its clash of arms and clank 
of mail, rings from the pages, and sweeps the reader on as with the resistless rush of the ocean. The editors 
of this magazine confidently affirm that America possesses no greater writer of fiction than George K. Baker. 

Broken Lights By Mowry Saben 

As an essayist Mr. Saben is unexcelled by any American writer. He is to a degree Arthur Symons, 
Walter Page, George Moore, and, perhaps, George Bernard Shaw, Americanized, or, shall we say, 
cosmopolitanized. He first attracted attention by his essays that were published in the Boston Transcript. 
These were followed by such important books as "The Spirit of Life" and "The Twilight of the Gods." 
The first of the essays assembled under the general title of "Broken Lights" is published in NEALE'S 
MONTHLY for September and the others will follow serially. The titles of the various papers are : " Some 
Modern Ways of Thinking," "A Criticism of Some Modern Ways of Thinking," "Puritanism," "The 
Right to Freedom," "Self-Realization," and "Life Considered as a Fine Art." 

Brilla By Anna M. Doling 

This unique and irresistible serial, the story of a lie, begins in NEALE'S MONTHLY for September. 
A region yet unexplored in literature, the Ozark Mountains, forms a picturesque background for the 
figures that move through this striking American novel. Seldom is it the good fortune of a reader to 
find an absorbingly interesting story written at once so simply and so well yet so compellingly. 

" Honest Graft " By Walter Neale 

The term "honest graft" seems to have been invented by Tammany's millionaire statesman, former 
Senator George Washington Plunkitt, who took the view that high public office may legitimately bring its 
incumbent more of this world's riches than his mere salary. Mr. Neale shows how productive were his 
seed of tares. The office of President of the United States enabled Theodore Roosevelt to add enormously 
to his income as an author. Woodrow Wilson began to contribute a series of articles to World's Work 
with the January number of that magazine, and the series is still running. This magazine was edited by 
Walter Hines Page until he qualified as Ambassador to Great Britain, and is published by the firm of 
which Ambassador Page is a member, and from which he still draws a salary, according to press reports. 
Thus the President of the United States is in a position of having appointed to the highest diplomatic post 
of the American people a man from whose firm he supposedly has been drawing large sums. Then, there are 
William Jennings Bryan, Champ Clark, Mr. Neale shows how Plunkitt's term "honest graft" has taken 
the place of Cleveland's dictum, " a public office is a public trust," in the language of many of our public men. 

IntO the Sunset By Edward S. Van Zile 

The first instalment of this novel was published in the August number of NEALE'S MONTHLY. The 
story which is full of the stir of life, the clash of swords, the roll of the sea, and " whisperings of love" 
tells of the romantic career of the first Irishman to reach the New World. He came with Columbus, 
and so did another young man, and so did two girls. Mr. Van Zile is the author of several successful 
novels, the most widely read of which, perhaps, is "With Sword and Crucifix," which won for him a 
doctor's degree in literature from Trinity College. 

Short fiction and various timely and interesting articles, besides the features enumerated above, will 
make NEALE'S MONTHLY for September noteworthy among American magazines. 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every number contains more 
than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain less than 128 pages. In its mechanical appoint- 
ments no magazine in existence is its superior.

double-leaded ; the presswork is of the best. In every respect this edition is worthy 
the great writer whose life-work in literature it presents to the world. 

So great a bargain in books of pure literature has never been offered before. 

These 400 sets are exactly like the "Autograph Edition," except they are not 
signed by the author, and they are bound in decorated cloth instead of in full 
morocco. They are a part of the first printing. No set of the "Autograph Edition," 
bound from these sheets, has been sold at less than $120, its price, and no set will 
ever be sold at less. 

There are, approximately, 100,000 words to the volume, or 1,200,000 words to 
the 12 volumes, the dimensions of which are about 6 inches wide, 9 inches long, and 
2 inches thick, and average more than 400 pages each. 

The man does not live, from the humblest in rank to the most exalted, from 
the most illiterate to the most erudite, who would not read time and again every line 
that Ambrose Bierce has written. 

Persons who wish to give as Christmas presents the magazine to one person and 
"The Collected Works" to another may enter their subscriptions accordingly, and 
both " Neale's Monthly " and " The Collected Works " will be held by the publishers 
on request for Christmas delivery on all subscriptions entered and paid for now.

THE GOLDEN RULE DOLLIVERS 

By MARGARET CAMERON 

Margaret Cameron has won fame as an inventor of unique plots and humorous

the Dollivers. Trouble? No end of it. Yet even while the reader laughs much 
at the Dollivers he sympathizes more. That is the charm of this novel. The 
humor of it sparkles and sings like a crystal brook through the story.

A NOVEL BY AUGUST STRINDBERG 


The Drama of To-Day ! 


By The Open Sea 

The Persons: 

A highly cultivated man whose mental unfolding 
parallels the development of modern thought. 

A beautiful woman, not wilfully bad, but the 
incarnation of the sex lure. 

The Setting: 

An island on which Nature releases her miracles; 
inhabited by fisherfolk, rude, prejudiced, and 
responsive only to the elemental hungers. 

The Plot: 

Given such a man and such a woman there is 
but one theme. But the complications that grow 
out of superstition, jealousy, and the conflict 
between cold reason and primal passion ! 

And the bleaching light of Nietzsche's philosophy 
over it all.

A National Work 
on 

American Literature 



The publication of an American Literature 
by William J. Long is an assurance that the 
student of literature will find a new book that 
is readable and accurate. The new and refresh- 
ing manner in which Mr. Long handles this sub- 
ject is exemplified in his well-known " English 
Literature." In distinction from many other 
books on American literature, this new work 
is emphatically national, and proceeds on the 
assumption that literature recognizes no boun- 
daries to the national spirit. 

The price of the book is $1.35. It will be 
ready about October first and may be pro- 
cured from the publishers, Ginn and Company, 
through their offices in Boston, New York, 
Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Columbus, San Fran- 
cisco, and London.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS . . .234 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

The classified list of the coming season's books, 
as made up from the announcements of Amer- 
ican publishing houses, and printed elsewhere 
in this issue, in accordance with our long-stand- 
ing custom, affords us the opportunity of mak- 
ing a random commentary upon the immediate 
literary outlook, selecting for mention a few of 
the titles of the most salient interest, although 
leaving many important categories untouched. 
As has been our custom heretofore, we devote 
this cursory view to works in the departments 
of history, biography, general literature, poetry, 
the drama, and fiction. The list is, if anything, 
of more than average interest, and many of its 
items are calculated to make the literary mouth 
water in anticipation of the prospective feast. 

In the historical section, a work of timely 
interest is "The United States and Mexico," 
covering the period 1821-1848 in our rela- 
tions with the sister republic. The author is 
Mr. George L. Rives, and the work fills two 
large volumes. " The Americans in the Philip- 
pines," by Mr. James A. Le Roy, in two vol- 
umes, will, we presume from its sponsors, be a 
contribution to the pernicious imperialistic pro- 
paganda. " The Major Operations of the Na- 
vies in the War of American Independence," 
is by that greatest of authorities upon naval 
strategics, Admiral A. T. Mahan. Professor 
McMaster's "History of the People of the 
United States" will now, after more than a 
score of years, be completed by an eighth vol- 
ume, covering the decade just preceding the 
Civil War, thus coming into sharp competition 
with the early volumes of Mr. Rhodes. " Chi- 
cago and the Old Northwest," by Mr. Milo M. 
Quaife, is the work of one of the best-equipped 
students of our local annals. The concluding 
volume of Mr. James Schouler's "History of 
the United States," Mr. E. C. Wingfield- Strat- 
ford's "History of English Patriotism," Lord 
Milner's " The Nation and the Empire," and 
James Douglas's "New England and New 
France," are other announcements of import- 
ance. 

In the category which covers biography, 
memoirs, and correspondence, there are two 
collections of letters that promise to be of sur- 
passing interest. It is something more than a 



192 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



promise, because we have already been permit- 
ted to read some of the letters of Charles Eliot 
Norton and William Vaughn Moody in the 
magazines. The Moody volume will include 
the letters that have appeared in the last two 
issues of the " Atlantic Monthly," and others, 
we hope. Those already printed are of such 
quality as to make imperative the demand for 
as complete a collection as can possibly be 
brought together. They take their place at 
once with the choicest epistolary treasures of 
our literature with the letters of Lamb and 
FitzGerald to name the most charming ex- 
amples of this form of composition. The letters, 
speeches, and correspondence of Carl Schurz, 
edited by Mr. Frederic Bancroft, are to be 
published in six volumes. The reminiscences 
of the greatest of American sculptors, Augustus 
Saint-Gaudens, will appear in finely illustrated 
form. A life of Lyman Trumbull, by the 
accomplished publicist, Mr. Horace White, will 
fill a gap that has too long remained vacant in 
the record of our great statesmen. "Fifty 
Years of My Life," by Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, 
while not exactly filling a gap, will doubtless 
be dear to his following for its hard-hitting and 
general breeziness. " Fremont and '49 " is a work 
which, from the pen of Mr. Frederic Dellen- 
baugh, is sure to prove of both interest and 
value. "The Everyday Life of Abraham Lin- 
coln," by Francis Fisher Browne, the late editor 
of this journal, has for many years been one of 
the best of the Lincoln biographies, and the last 
months of the author's life were spent upon a 
thorough revision of the work for publication 
this fall. A monument of painstaking industry 
and conscientious scholarship may be expected 
when Dr. H. C. Chatfield-Taylor's life of 
Goldoni appears from the press. This work, 
upon which the author has been engaged ever 
since he published his life of Molidre, will pro- 
vide the first adequate account of Goldoni in 
the English language, and probably in any 
other. Other prominent works of biography 
are a life of Bulwer-Lytton,by the present Earl 
of Lytton ; a life of Anthony Trollope, by Mr. 
T. H. S. Escott ; the memoirs of Henry Labou- 
chere ; Clara Louise Kellogg's " Memoirs of a 
Prima Donna "; "Wagner as Man and Artist," 
by Mr. Ernest Newman ; and a volume on 
Strindberg, by Miss Lind-af-Hageby, the 
notorious Swedish anti-vivisectionist. 

The list of works of general literature, as 
distinguished from history and biography, does 
not seem to include many important titles. 
Perhaps the most attractive is the first com- 



plete English translation of "Simplicius Sim- 
plicissimus," that extraordinary narrative of 
vagabond life during the period of the Thirty 
Years' War. Mr. Percy H. Boynton's "Lon- 
don in English Literature" is the result of 
many months spent in seeking out and identi- 
fying the haunts and shrines of famous English 
authors in London. A new volume by the 
venerable John Burroughs is " The Summit of 
the Years." We cannot say what Vernon Lee's 
" A Tower of Mirrors " will be like, but may be 
assured that it will be beautifully written and 
full of philosophical discernment. Mr. H. W. 
Mabie's "American Ideals: Character and 
Life" will, we presume, give us his lectures 
delivered in Japan as a missionary of American 
culture. " Half -Lengths," by G. W. E. Rus- 
sell, is a title that seems to promise much genial 
entertainment. 

Books about the drama and the actual texts 
of plays are increasing in number every year, 
to correspond with the extraordinary revival of 
interest in this literary species. We note Mr. 
Brander Matthews's " Shakespeare as a Play- 
wright," "The Fools of Shakespeare," by Mr. 
Frederic Warde; "The Elizabethan Play- 
house," second series, by Mr. W. J. Lawrence ; 
"Ten More Plays of Shakespeare," by Mr. 
Stopford Brooke; " Beaumont, the Dramatist," 
by Mr. C. M. Gay ley; as well as the Goldoni 
and Strindberg volumes previously mentioned. 
Mr. Archibald Henderson will have a volume 
called "European Dramatists," Mr. Richard 
Burton one on "The New American Drama," 
Lady Gregory an account of "Our Irish The- 
atre," Miss Mary Caroline Crawford a volume 
entitled " The Romance of the American The- 
atre," and Mr. Charlton Andrews one entitled 
"The Drama To-day." Among new dramatic 
works the following may be noted : " The 
Tragedy of Pompey," by Mr. John Masefield ; 
"Joseph and His Brethren," a pageant-play by 
Mr. Louis N. Parker ; and " Horace Walpole," 
by Mr. Gustave Simonson; translations in- 
clude M. Hervieu's " The Labyrinth," M. Pela- 
don's " Saint Francis of Assisi," and new vol- 
umes of Strindberg and Hauptmann. 

The mere titles of forthcoming books of verse 
do not convey much information, unless per- 
chance the authors are "placed" in our minds. 
A few that seem worth transcribing are these: 
" Salt Water Ballads," by Mr. John Masefield ; 
"The Wolf of Gubbio," by Mrs. Josephine 
Preston Peabody Marks ; " The Lonely Dancer, 
and Other Poems," by Mr. Richard LeGallienne ; 
"The Collected Poems of Margaret Woods" 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



193 



"Minions of the Moon," by Mr. Madison 
Cawein; "Merchants from Cathay," by Mr. 
William Rose Benet; and "Last Poems," by 
the late Mrs. Dorr. Doubtless, the season will 
give us much new poetry as yet unheralded; 
it is our usual experience to learn of the best 
work in this kind when it makes its actual 
appearance. 

The multitudinous array of forthcoming nov- 
els gives the most daring commentator pause, 
but, at the risk of seeming invidious, we will 
name the following fifteen as destined to stand 
somewhere near the forefront of the confirmed 
fiction reader's attention: An unnamed novel, 
by Mr. William De Morgan; "The Dark 
Flower," by Mr. John Galsworthy; "Bendish, 
a Study in Prodigality," by Mr. Maurice Hew- 
lett; "Youth's Encounter," by Mr. Compton 
Mackenzie ; " The Honorable Senator Sage- 
Brush," by Mr. Francis Lynde; "The Great 
Adventure," by Mr. Robert Herrick; "West- 
ways," by Dr. Weir Mitchell; "The Business 
of Life," by Mr. Robert W. Chambers; "The 
Happy Ship," by Mr. Stephen French Whit- 
man ; " The Will to Live," by Miss M. P. 
Willcocks ; " After All," by Miss Mary Chol- 
mondeley ; " The Custom of the Country," by 
Mrs. Edith Wharton; "Van Cleve," by Mrs. 
Mary S. Watts > and " Hagar," by Miss Mary 
Johnston. One could get much of the cream 
of the season's output by reading these novels, 
and perhaps fifteen is as large a number as 
anyone who cares for tranquillity of soul ought 
to read in a single season. 



SHELLEY ONCE MORE. 



There ought to be a critical Index Expurgator- 
ius, a list of subjects which, either because of 
their difficulty or because they have already been 
talked to rags, should forevermore be taboo to dis- 
cussion. The identity of the dedicatee and the dark 
lady of Shakespeare's sonnets, Poe's alleged debts 
and drunkenness, the marital infelicities of Byron, 
Shelley, and Carlyle, are among the matters which 
should be thus set aside. To say the least, they have 
been frightfully overworked, and deserve a period 
of rest. 

But gossip is the foul familiar of Fame. Those 
who attain to the accolade of the latter must submit 
to the malignant eye, the leering laugh, the intruding 
finger of the former. There can be no canonization 
without the Devil's Advocate. If people would 
only grant the possibility that in a question between 
a man of genius and an ordinary person, the man 
of genius may be right and the ordinary person 
wrong, there might be some use in infinite bio- 



graphical discussion. But judgment is usually given 
the other way. Mankind refuses to have its sun 
without spots, and it is more interested in the spots 
than in the light. In its own interest and for the 
sake of its debt to genius it ought to control this 
instinct of unwholesome curiosity. It ought to deal 
with erring great men as the sons of Noah did wben 
they found their father lying drunk and exposed, 
walk backward and cover them with a mantle. 

Shelley is perhaps the most intensely interesting 
personality in literary history. He is the accom- 
plishment of the type, the realization of the idea of 
what the world has always meant by the word 
"poet." Byron called him "The Snake," and he 
had the fascination which that animal is fabled to 
possess without any of its sinister or repulsive char- 
acteristics. If grave men still feel his fascination, 
is it any wonder that the women with whom he was 
thrown could not resist it? To speak plainly, women 
always and everywhere flung themselves at his head. 
He did not invite this bombardment, for he avoided 
society, and was a hermit and solitary. More charity 
is surely due him than for men who are not subject 
to such experiences. Yet his relations with women 
have damned him in the books of the good or the 
pretended good. During his lifetime he was ac- 
counted a fiend ; and when after many years the 
efforts of his friends and admirers lifted a little the 
pall of obloquy which covered his dead body, two 
strong hands drew it back the hands of Matthew 
Arnold and Mark Twain. Arnold's opinion was the 
man of the world's view, tolerant, slightly amused, 
but cuttingly severe ; Mark Twain's might be called 
the backwoods opinion, and was less an opinion than 
a shower of mud. In those circumstances, it could 
hardly be expected that Shelley's disciples should 
remain silent ; and accordingly Mr. Henry S. Salt, 
in " Shelley : Poet and Pioneer," comes to the rescue 
of his character. 

One regrets to meddle in the matter, or to retell 
in brief the so often told story of Shelley's first 
marriage. But in mere fairness the thing seems 
unavoidable. Mr. Salt makes it pretty evident that 
Shelley was not in love with Harriet Westbrook 
and did not want to marry her. She ran away from 
her home, and threw herself upon his protection. 
There were three things then that he could do. He 
might reject her, compromised and humiliated; he 
might make her his mistress; he might make her 
his wife. With splendid generosity, the boy (for he 
was nothing more) chose the last course, flying in 
the face of his father and all his worldly interests. 
From that issue sprang unnumbered woes. 

The boy-and-girl union was happy enough in the 
beginning, for Harriet was attractive and Shelley 
attentive. But the differences between them in 
training, temperament, and tastes were sure to de- 
velop sooner or later. Mr. Salt states, and evidence 
and probability point that way, that before there was 
any question of Shelley's infidelity there had grown 
up a barrier between them. He claims that this was 
Harriet's fault; that her character hardened, and

[Sept. 16 



that she rejected attempts at conciliation. Shelley 
had never believed in marriage, and his opinions on 
divorce were probably the same as those held by 
Milton, George Meredith, and other great men, and 
which are pretty widely in vogue to-day. It may 
be said that this does not matter; that neither the 
opinions of great men nor the votes of the multitude 
can determine a question of ethics. Practically, 
though, and in a social way, they do determine it. 
However, Shelley thought himself free to seek his 
happiness, and he left his unsympathetic wife and 
formed a free union with Mary Godwin. Harriet 
retained her children, and was provided for mate- 
rially. It was to all intents a divorce, and no more 
reprehensible than thousands of such separations 
which are occurring every day. Two years later, 
however, Harriet, obeying a suicidal bent which 
had shown itself in early life, drowned herself in 
the Serpentine. If there were any irregularities in 
her life after the separation, she only followed 
Shelley's precept and example. He never tried to 
exculpate himself by bringing charges against her, 
and his defenders would have done better to have 
remained silent also. 

What are we to say in the matter? Compromise 
is always stupid, but it is generally reasonable. It 
seems to us that there is a good helping of blame for 
both parties ; but, considering their ages and tempta- 
tions, no cause for damnatory reprobation of either. 
Shelley's future page was fair enough. In spite of 
his objections to marriage, he married Mary as soon 
as he could, and there is not a shred of real evidence 
to show that he was unfaithful to her. The enthu- 
siasms and admirations expressed for other women 
in his poetry do not appear to have been translated 
into life. In regard to women, indeed, a poet is in 
hard case. Unless he puts his appreciation of their 
beauty and charm into verse he is apt not to become 
a poet at all ; and if he does, as Shelley complained, 
people " approximate him to the circle of a servant 
girl and her lover." A great artist may paint a 
gallery of portraits of fair women, his sitters ; may 
throw his whole soul into the depiction of their sen- 
suous or spiritual charms, yet he will not be accused 
of indiscriminate lovemaking. Really the world 
ought to accustom itself to a little hardness of heart 
in regard to the woes of women admired by poets. 
The women themselves are generally satisfied. Their 
vanity is flattered, and they get immortality, which 
is more than any other kind of men can give them. 

Contrary to received opinion, Shelley was less of 
a ladies' man than a man's man. His men friends, 
Hogg, Leigh Hunt, Peacock, Byron, Medwin, Tre- 
lawney, he grappled to his soul with hoops of steel. 
They never speak of him except as a miracle of 
gentleness, generosity, disinterestedness, wisdom, 
courage, and common-sense. From the least to the 
greatest they recognized in him a being superior to 
themselves. 

For an " ineffectual angel," as Arnold called him, 
Shelley has been the most potent warrior of ideas in 
modern times. He is the pioneer of pioneers. There 



is hardly a phase of political reform or social agita- 
tion that has come up since his day which he did 
not anticipate ; and his ringing cry has been most 
effectual in urging the battle on. Religious tolera- 
tion, the union of workers, peaceful resistance to 
oppression, the improvement of woman's position, 
the non-sacredness of property, the attack on privi- 
lege, and generally everything that makes for the 
rise of the poor and downtrodden, were forced into 
fiery propaganda by him. Of course he did not in 
most cases originate the ideas. They came to him 
by inheritance from Voltaire, Rousseau, and the 
other prophets of the French Revolution, and from 
Godwin at home; but he brought them all to a focus, 
to burn in his eloquent verse and prose. Also, 
in the final analysis, there is the same fatal flaw of 
conduct as in Tolstoi's case. They are both aristo- 
crats pointing the way for the poor, but not exactly 
going that way themselves. That, in spite of all 
their generosities and unselfishness, they did not 
altogether divest themselves of the benefits of for- 
tune, was of course a counsel of common-sense. 
Both were totally unfitted to earn their own livings. 
Tolstoi is said to have made the worst boots in 
Russia, and if Shelley had had to keep books he 
would have starved to death. They did not live in 
countries where, like Buddha, they could put away 
their princedoms and take up the begging bowl and 
depend upon disciples for support. But the fact 
that they remained aristocrats keeps them from being 
the real protagonists of the poor. 

Shelley was endowed with the metaphysical bent, 
and the myth-making instinct which goes with it. 
He was fairly well read in European philosophy. 
He knew Hume, and had absorbed the parts of 
Plato that pleased him. He of course knew nothing 
of the dark pessimisms of the East, and his 
ignorance and temperament allowed him to accept 
the doctrines of the perfectibility of man and a 
future Golden Age. About the idea of personal 
immortality, the sole outlet for hope for man, his 
mind seems to have been to let. He rejected 
Christianity, and probably this dogma with it, and 
his mind dallied with a vague idea of pantheistic 
life. On the whole, his philosophy was a trifle 
shallow, as all optimism which is bounded by the 
expectations of this world must be. 

Mr. Salt challenges Matthew Arnold's verdict on 
Shelley's poetry, and certainly he has reason as far 
as some of the critic's dicta are concerned. Essen- 
tially, however, Arnold was right. The note of 
Shelley's style is eloquence eloquence and a thin, 
aerial, haunting music, which is not superior to the 
rich complex tones of other English poets, but differ- 
ent. Whatever the finest or most magnificent rhet- 
oric, the most persuasive linking together of logic 
and English of the purest in exquisite modulation, 
whatever these things can do in poetry, Shelley 
has at command. He does not have at command 
that condensation of words which stamps coins and 
counters of expression for mankind. He does not 
have at command those verbal embodiments of 



1913] 



THE DIAL

vision whose gleam and glamor lighten every corner 
of the mind. Vast tracts of his poetry are merely 
eloquent improvisations, and unless one is interested 
in the ideas they contain they are really unreadable. 
The lines on the " Euganean Hills " are among his 
best, but we read them as if we were wallowing 
through a mist. " The Sensitive Plant " is excellent, 
but place it by the side of Coleridge's " Christabel " 
and it fades and dims and dies into eclipse. Even at 
the last, when influenced by a study of Keats, he did 
approximate to the rich, full-bodied English manner, 
he is still rhetorical. Compare the "Ode to the 
West Wind," his masterpiece, with Wordsworth's 
Lines to Peele Castle. Shelley builds up his piece 
with an infinitely delicate logical architecture, em- 
bellishes it with beautiful rhetorical decoration, thrills 
it through with vibrating tones of music. Words- 
worth's piece is plain in manner and monotonous 
in music; but line after line of it goes home to the 
hearths and bosoms of mankind, and from its cen- 
tral heart leaps out the phrase, 

" The light that never was on sea or land," 
which expresses in an instant all that Shelley was 
trying to say all his life. To adapt a Johnsonian 
simile, Wordsworth delivers the oracle, while Shelley 
only shows us the Sibyl's graceful gesticulations and 
illuminated face. 

The gifts that Shelley did possess, his fascinat- 
ing personality, his political prevision, his profusion 
of ideas, his persuasive eloquence, his considerable 
creative power, above all, his rare and original 
music, are sufficient to make him one of the gods 
of literature. But weight and magic of words to 
any appreciable extent he did not have, and they are 
the central jewels in the poet's carcanet.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A QUESTION FOR MANUSCRIPT-COLLECTORS, and 

one that they will probably never answer in entire 
agreement with one another, is this : Where is the 
original manuscript of Lincoln's Gettysburg address ? 
This matter recently formed the subject of a para- 
graph in these columns, and now it comes up again 
in the Boston " Transcript," in an article by Mr. 
George H. Sargent on " Adventures of Celebrated 
Manuscripts." He says: "Unfortunately it is not 
permitted to mention the name of the owner in 
Boston of the original manuscript of Lincoln's im- 
mortal Gettysburg address. It is reposing in one of 
the safe deposit vaults in the Ames Building. This 
manuscript was written by Lincoln on the train which 
carried the presidential party to Gettysburg. It is 
on small sheets of paper, in the clear, neat hand of 
Lincoln, who gave it to Edward Everett, the orator 
of the day. Together with Everett's long oration, 
which nearly everybody has forgotten, and which 
no schoolboy ever recited, the manuscripts were sold 
at the Sanitary Fair for the benefit of the soldiers. 



From the purchaser they passed by inheritance into 
the hands of the present possessor." But General 
James Grant Wilson, who knew Lincoln well and 
was much with him about the time of the Gettysburg 
address, and who has made a careful study of the 
subject, has recently (see the New York "Times" 
of June 29) given his account of the five copies of 
the speech which he says are known to have been 
written out by Lincoln himself ; and this is what he 
has to say, if he is correctly reported, concerning the 
manuscript referred to above : " The copy used by 
the fair [the Maryland Soldiers' and Sailors' Fair] 
ranks as the fourth, and the fifth was written in the 
same year [1864] for Edward Everett, who wanted 
to have it bound with the manuscript of his own 
oration at Gettysburg and the President's letter to 
him of Nov. 20, 1863, to be sold at the New York 
Metropolitan Fair for the benefit of the United States 
Sanitary Commission." In addition to the two copies 
furnished for the fairs named in the foregoing, a copy 
appears to have been given to each of the President's 
secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, and one to George 
Bancroft. The Nicolay copy, General Wilson tells 
us, was afterward lost or stolen, and has never been 
heard of since, which is the more to be regretted as 
it seems to have been the very first draft of the 
famous speech. But the whole affair is so involved 
in uncertainty and dispute that it would be rash to 
make any positive assertions as to any of its details. 

THE UNPROTECTED BOOK-TITLE might seem to 
have a grievance in that it can hope for no such 
legal safeguard against violation and abuse as can 
the more fortunate trade-mark and trade-name. 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin " may lawfully be affixed as a 
title to any piece of writing by any scribbler, but woe 
betide the man who offers for sale as a " Kodak " a 
camera not made by the Eastman Company. The 
makers of a well-known baking powder estimate 
the value of the word Royal in their business at 
eight million dollars, and the name " Coca-Cola " is 
appraised at five million. Surely, then, there is 
commercial value in such a name as "Trilby," or 
" Queed," and why should not the inventors of these 
catching titles be protected in their right to use them? 
A writer in the August issue of "The Bulletin of 
the Authors' League of America " considers at some 
length this question of "the protection of titles," 
and cites a number of illustrative cases at law ; and 
although the utmost that can be gained from copy- 
right is security in the right " to print a set of intel- 
lectual ideas or modes of thinking communicated in 
a set of words or sentences or modes of expression," 
there still remains in certain cases the possibility of 
protection under "the law of Unfair Competition by 
reason of a probable deception of the public, with the 
incidental unjust appropriation of the fruits of his own 
labor by others." Also, as in the case of the "Nick 
Carter" series of blood-curdlers, a non-descriptive 
and commercially valuable name may be registered, 
just as the "Porosknit" brand of underwear has its 
name registered. And, finally, where neither regis- 



196

tration nor copyright avails to secure the author 
in the enjoyment of the fruits of his invention and 
fancy, he may appeal to the broad general powers 
of a court of equity to prevent the deception and 
tricking of the public by the offering of goods for 
sale under false pretenses, and the consequent unjust 
diminution of his own legitimate gains. So perhaps, 
after all, as things go in this imperfect world, the 
author is fairly well protected in his right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 


A BOOK-BUYER'S COMPLAINT, even though it is 
true that all the world turns with aversion from the 
man with a grievance, may sometimes, if genially 
worded, serve to give a welcome hint to those 
engaged in the manufacture and sale of reading 
matter. Mr. John L. Hervey contributes to the 
September "Atlantic" a humorous-querulous dis- 
quisition entitled " The Tribulations of an Amateur 
Book-Buyer," which may be read as a sort of sup- 
plement to Mr. George P. Brett's " Book-Publishing 
and its Present Tendencies " in the April number 
of the same magazine. Mr. Hervey's tribulations, 
he says, "have arisen chiefly from two causes: the 
question of price, and the question of storage." 
Serious books cost more than they ought to, and 
books of whatever kind take up too much room 
to meet the wishes of a book-buyer of moderate 
means and living in a house of moderate size. 
India paper and flexible bindings are doing some- 
thing to solve the problem of storage, and the cheap 
and excellent reprint is helping to ease the strain 
on the purse. Nevertheless the new copyrighted 
serious work is offered at a price often prohibitive 
to the ordinary purchaser, who, if he is wise, bides 
his time till the book passes into the " remainder " 
class or is reissued in less expensive form, and then 
he buys it at perhaps one-half its original price. 
Still an outsider is tempted to query whether it 
would not have been good business to issue the book 
at a lower price in the beginning. A book sales- 
man quoted by Mr. Hervey says in regard to a 
work of this kind: "I sold quite a number of sets 
of Wagner's ' My Life ' at eight dollars, for there 
was wide interest in it ; but I could have sold three 
times as many, I am certain, at five dollars." A 
book-buyer of limited means but unlimited desires 
may well resent or at least regret a practice by 
which the publisher skims the cream of his wealthy 
patronage before appealing with more reasonable 
prices to the larger and less opulent public. It is 
like being asked at a banquet to wait and eat at the 
second table. But possibly one ought to be thankful 
if there is a second table spread at all, and one is 
not sent home fasting. 



AN EMBARRASSING GIFT, like the baby elephant 
that a facetious friend made Mark Twain believe he 
was to be encumbered with at Stormfield, is often 
many times worse than no gift at all. The announce- 
ment that the little town of Ashfield in Western 
Massachusetts a town once famous for its summer 



colony of learning and culture, and for its annual 
" Ashfield dinner " is to be presented with a 
thirty-thousand-dollar public library by a filially 
affectionate native of the place, Mr. M. M. Belding 
of New York, prompts the query whether a little 
farming community of less than a thousand inhab- 
itants, barely making its rock-ribbed acres yield it 
a livelihood, will thoroughly enjoy the prospect of 
maintaining the splendid institution whose marble 
walls, bronze doors, pedestal lamps, and other lux- 
urious appurtenances, will present an appearance so 
strikingly at variance with their simple rural environ- 
ment. Already the yearly tax-bill is a nightmare to 
the Ashfield farmer. What, then, will be his frame 
of mind when the expense of this library's mainte- 
nance is added to the town's burden? But it may 
be that this anxious inquiry is premature. Perhaps 
Mr. Belding is planning to add a handsome endow- 
ment fund to his generous benefaction, and to be in 
some degree to Ashfield what the late H. H. Rogers 
was to his native Fairhaven. Therefore we will not 
borrow trouble, but rather take pleasure in picturing 
to ourselves the fine structure that already has taken 
shape in the designs of the Samuel M. Green Com- 
pany, of Springfield, and that is to be erected by 
Fred T. Ley & Co., of the same city. A capacity 
for fourteen thousand volumes is contemplated, and 
all the rooms are to be on the ground floor. Indeed 
there is to be but one story to the building, which 
will be fifty-three by forty-one feet in dimensions, 
fire-proof in construction, and with walls of marble 
from the St. Lawrence quarries at Gouverneur, N. Y. 
Furnace heat and illumination by a special gas-plant, 
with other items of modern equipment, are in the 
plans. The Belding Public Library will typify, and 
more than typify, the progressive spirit of Massa- 
chusetts in respect to free libraries for all the people. 


THE LIBRARY AS CLUB-HOUSE often serves, espe- 
cially if it has an assembly room or conversation 
room attached, to draw young people, and older 
ones too, who otherwise might turn their steps 
toward resorts of a less unobjectionable character. 
An acquaintance of ours is fond of dilating on 
the superior attractions of the light and cheerful 
though simply-furnished library reading-room to the 
luxuriously-appointed lounging-room of his club, 
and also on the greater profit he derives from fre- 
quenting the one rather than the other. Mr. 
Richard Lloyd Jones, editor of the "Wisconsin 
State Journal," describes in the " Wisconsin Library 
Bulletin," his discovery of a wonderful little public 
library in the Canadian mining town of Nelson, far 
away in the great Northwest, and relates what the 
librarian, who had virtually created that library, 
had succeeded in making of it. There were in 
Nelson no dance-halls, no gambling joints, no 
hang-outs of any kind except the library, with its 
assembly-room, billiard tables in the basement, card 
tables and checker boards, and other provisions 
for harmless and well-ordered recreation. Of the 
" rather frail but pretty little lady of about thirty " 



1913] 



197 



who had thus made Nelson so agreeably different 
from the typical western mining town, Mr. Lloyd 
Jones has considerable to say in admiring praise. 
" More than a hundred miles away from the main 
line of any railroad, lost in the canyons of Kootenay, 
she had made a camp a city, she had made a little 
mining municipality the pride of a crown, and 
the crown's guests had been taken off the main line 
of their travel and through more than a hundred 
miles of matchless scenery to behold, not what 
nature had done, but what a little English girl, an 
amateur librarian, had done. . . . To my notion 
that little lady was a LIBRARIAN." Not only did 
she admirably fill her place, but she had actually 
created the place before she proceeded to fill it. 



AN IDEAL GRADUATE SCHOOL for those who love 
learning for its own sake, and to whom vocational 
training and bread-and-butter studies are abhorrent 
in the superlative degree, is about to open its doors 
at Princeton to a select company of one hundred 
picked students and the requisite number of care- 
fully-selected instructors a veritable aristocracy of 
brains. Richly endowed and generous in its provis- 
ion of free scholarships, it ought to be able to steer 
clear of the peril of becoming an aristocracy less 
estimable in character a peril dreaded by Presi- 
dent Wilson when the plan of the school, with its 
somewhat sequestered location, was under discussion 
three years ago. Here the poor but gifted student, 
unable perhaps to gratify a cherished longing for a 
course at Leipzig or Athens, at Paris or Rome, ought 
to find himself moved with somewhat the same feel- 
ing that prompted Erasmus to exclaim, when he had 
made his way to Oxford in despair of accomplishing 
the longer journey to Italy: "I have found in Oxford 
so much polish and learning that now I hardly care 
about going to Italy at all, save for the sake of hav- 
ing been there. When I listen to my friend Colet, 
it seems like listening to Plato himself. Who does 
not wonder at the wide range of Grocyn's knowl- 
edge? What can be more searching, deep, and 
refined than the judgment of Linacre? When did 
Nature mould a temper more gentle, endearing, and 
happy than the temper of Thomas More?" That 
the faculty of this new school, the most noteworthy 
of its kind that our country has yet seen, will include 
men of the stamp of Colet, Grocyn, Linacre, and 
Thomas More, it would be rash to predict ; but it is 
said that the whole academic world has been searched 
for teachers of the desired mental equipment and 
ability. . . . 

AN EDITORIAL SALUTATORY of unusual interest 
appears in the current issue of "The Century 
Magazine," marking the entrance of Mr. Robert 
Sterling Yard upon his duties as head of the 
periodical founded forty-three years ago under the 
name of " Scribner's Monthly." Dr. J. G. Holland, 
Richard Watson Gilder, and Mr. Robert Underwood 
Johnson have successively filled the chair that now 
receives Mr. Yard as its fourth occupant. Appro- 



priately and gracefully the new editor gives a 
backward glance and pays a word of tribute to his 
predecessors before turning his gaze toward the 
future now beckoning him to the achievement of 
still greater things than any attained to by those 
earlier directors of the magazine's fortunes. After 
announcing a determination to maintain a "fair, 
free, unbiased spirit of investigation," and " to enlist 
the services of able authorities in every cause, and 
to present each justly from its own point of view," 
the new editor hopefully continues: "As for the 
rest, we shall conserve the best that. THE CENTURY 
has stood for in the past. We shall offer a larger 
proportion of fiction than formerly, and shall bring 
it as near to truth, and make it as interpretative of 
life, as conditions allow. We shall maintain illus- 
tration at the highest point modern method will 
permit. We shall cultivate history and poetry and 
the essay. We shall explore conditions at home 
and abroad. We shall make this magazine, fear- 
lessly and in the white light of to-day, as nearly the 
magazine of the century as courage and devotion 
and eyes that see and minds that shrink not can 
do." In a word, the aim is to be the highest pos- 
sible; and what more could one ask? 



A WEAKNESS OF THE PRIZE NOVEL, as of the 

prize poem, the prize essay, or almost any other 
piece of literary work performed under the stimulus 
of a hoped-for reward in cold cash, is indicated in 
some of the communications from would-be prize- 
winners to Messrs. Reilly & Britton, the Chicago 
publishers who lately offered ten thousand dollars 
for the best novel submitted within a given time. 
"I will do my very best in writing one," hopefully/ 
promises one contestant; " I am only a young widow 
and would love to win a prize." "I never written 
an article for A Contest in my life," says another, 
" But I will try any thing once, Being A brick mason, 
I have some pretty good dope, scattered along 
Twenty-five years experience, which, if I can correll 
into proper shape, might be readable." Writers, 
both professional and amateur, are human, and it is 
only natural that they should, like the above-named 
young widow, "love to win a prize" even more than 
they love the labor that is to enable them to win it. 
The image of the honest brick-mason, laboriously 
building his story, brick upon brick, in the fond 
hope of securing by the prowess of his trowel the ten 
thousand-dollar reward, is amusing, even pathetic, 
and richly significant in its illustration of the way 
real literature is not produced. 


THE LITERARY DIVERSIONS OF A RETIRED DIPLO- 
MAT, with such a record of arduous public service 
as stands to the credit of Lord Cromer, might not be 
expected to give evidence of so wide and intimate 
acquaintance with the classics as is made manifest 
both by his book of " Paraphrases and Translations 
from the Greek" and by his contribution to the cur- 
rent "Edinburgh Review" on the kindred subject of 
"Translation and Paraphrase." As an illustration 



198

[Sept. 16 



of the familiarity with polite literature evinced by 
him who has had so much to do with the making of 
modern Egypt, it may be interesting to observe that 
in the last-named production he quotes from or refers 
to a score or more of the old authors and a number 
of the moderns, including Homer, Herodotus, Pin- 
dar, Sappho, Euripides, Demosthenes, Empedocles, 
Aristotle, Lucian, Longinus, Lucretius, Quintilian, 
Dryden, Coleridge, Lamb, and Emerson. Not every 
public man who is not also a professed scholar can 
quote the Greek poets in the original so aptly and 
extensively as Lord Cromer. 



A PROPOSED LATIN-AMERICAN LIBRARY is 
among the things talked about and planned in con- 
nection with the projected "tallest ever" building of 
the Pan-American States Association in New York. 
To open the building for Pan-American purposes 
simultaneously with the opening of the Pan-Amer- 
ican Exposition at San Francisco is now the hope 
and desire of the architects of the grandiose scheme. 
Nine hundred and one feet (why not a thousand and 
one, with a statue of Scheherazade to cap the topmost 
pinnacle?) the structure, if it should be built, is to 
rise toward heaven, or a good hundred and fifty feet 
higher than Mr. Wool worth's present record-breaker. 
One floor of the mammoth edifice is to be used for 
club purposes and to have a library "containing 
information regarding anything and everything per- 
taining to the commerce and people of all the Latin- 
American republics, and the floor above that will be 
set aside for similar purposes, but to contain statistics 
of American affairs and reports of Chambers of 
Commerce such as might be of use to business men." 
So runs the published description of the library part 
of this ambitious enterprise. If an upper floor or 
floors should be chosen for the library, it would have 
the distinction of raising literature to a higher level 
than has hitherto been attained. 



THE BOOK-COLLECTOR'S FRIEND was what Bernard 
Quaritch, who died at Brighton, England, August 
27, proved himself to be to the many whom he so 
intelligently and capably aided in the acquisition of 
rare works of literature, precious prints, and price- 
less manuscripts. Son of the still better-known book- 
dealer of the same name, the younger Quaritch 
followed worthily in his father's steps and was inde- 
fatigable in his quest of whatever seemed most desir- 
able in his department of the book-trade. It was 
in the course of a business visit to this country that 
he contracted the disease of which he died. He was 
present at the Hoe sale in New York last January, 
and secured a number of valuable works. The fame 
of his father for letting no expense deter him from 
obtaining whatever literary treasure he chose to be- 
come the possessor of would probably have been 
equalled by that of the son, had the latter's life 
been spared. Many important works, moreover, 
bore the imprint of the house, which acted as agent 
for the publications of the British Museum and the 
Society of Antiquities. 



A NEW COURSE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE is announced 
by the Wisconsin Library Commission, whose cur- 
rent "Bulletin" briefly explains the nature of the 
course and refers for further information to the 
"detailed statement " which is sent upon application. 
The course is given " in connection with work at the 
University of Wisconsin, with which the library 
school is affiliated." We read further: "There is 
an evident demand for workers capable of devel- 
oping the sociological phases of the library. The 
establishment and growth of legislative, municipal, 
philanthropic, and other social science libraries is 
being seriously hampered by dearth of well-equipped 
workers. The Wisconsin library commission, there- 
fore, gains courage to announce a library course of 
an untried nature from the fact that the work which 
it seeks to do sadly needs doing, while nobody else 
seems willing to do it." Knowledge of a special 
subject, rather than mastery of library technique as 
a whole, seems to be the keynote to the new course, 
which should appeal to many who instinctively abhor 
the mere drudgery of library management. This 
promises to be a notable development in the speciali- 
zation that has already well begun in the broad domain 
of library science. ... 

PARCEL-POST RATES FOR BOOKS ought soon to be 
granted if earnestness of demand from those whose 
petition should be heard is to count for anything. 
More than one hundred librarians from all parts of 
the country are said to have written to Represent- 
ative David J. Lewis of Maryland in approval of 
his bill enacting the desired reform, and similar 
letters are being sent directly to the post-office 
department. Among librarians urgent and active 
in the matter are those of the Enoch Pratt Free 
Library of Baltimore, the Yale University Library, 
the Virginia State Library, the Library of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Worces- 
ter Public Library, the Cincinnati Public Library, 
the Connecticut State Library, the General Theo- 
logical Library of Boston, and the Library of the 
New York Bar Association. By all means let the 
pressure be continued and increased, until books 
shall receive from the postal authorities the same 
favor as cucumbers and calico. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

UNANIMITY IN LITERARY CRITICISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wish I could share the optimism of my good friend- 
Mr. James Lane Allen, as to the unanimity of independent 
criticism, or the independence of unanimous criticism, 
While I would certainly agree that out of one hundred 
and fifty critics, one hundred and forty ought to accord 
high praise to his work, and I should be sorry for the 
temperament or starved condition of the other ten, 
nevertheless, in the interest of the truth, 1 ! feel called upon 
to question his statement that " these one hundred and 
tifty minds were working sincerely and intelligently."

which they publish. It is written by the literary ad- 
viser or the publicity-man. These ready-made " book- 
notices " accompany the books when they are handed to 
the literary editors of the papers and magazines. Over- 
whelmed with the torrent of new publications which 
must be reviewed, the literary editor, in hundreds of 
cases, seizes upon the help thus afforded and prints the 
notice either in extenso or with certain modifications. 
Every publisher knows that there is a remarkable same- 
ness in the wording of criticisms. This is vividly called 
to his attention when, wishing to take off the snapper at 
the end of the whip to use in his advertisements, there 
are comparatively few that he can use, because he him- 
self has furnished the very stimulus desirable to apply 
to the languid book-buyer, who may be imagined as 
hesitating whether to buy a new automobile or a vol- 
ume of poems, let us say. 

This accusation is not quite so severe as might be 
supposed, because the bard-worked critic is not wholly 
unscrupulous : he certainly glances at the separate books 
making the never-ending tide; he is sincerely desirous 
of knowing what is coming along; and by practice and 
alertness often a glance will tell him if the book be 
good or bad. A butter-taster does not have to eat a 
whole tub of butter to decide whether the commodity is 
rancid or not, or whether it is oleomargarine. 

But there is no question at all that the larger part of 
newspaper criticism is not worthy of the name, as far 
as intelligent, original, canonical weighing of literature 
is concerned. I think all publishers and most authors, 
who look over the " press-notices " of their books, will 
agree with me that this is so. 

The true frame of mind for an author is to be immune 
to the stings of adverse criticism as well as to the poison 
of flattery: to regard his own work as wholly imper- 
sonal, and if errors of fact or slovenliness of style be 
pointed out, to accept the animadversion gratefully and 
correct them in the next edition, and, if a chorus of 
praise ascend, to remain humble and not feel undue 
exhilaration. NATHAN HASKELL DOLE.

MR. ALFRED NOYES'S POETRY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In reading THE DIAL of August 16, 1 was especially 
interested in Mr. William Morton Payne's admirable 
review of Mr. Alfred Noyes's " Tales of the Mermaid 
Tavern." That a conservative, thoughtful critic of the 
high standing of Mr. Payne should laud Mr. Noyes so 
enthusiastically is but another proof that Noyes is a 
major poet. 

1 feel compelled, however, to take issue with Mr. 
Payne when he says: " We do not find in him [Noyes] 
the perfect finish of Tennysonian art, and Tennyson is 
perhaps the only one of the great Victorians whom his 
performance does not challenge." I am afraid Mr. 
Payne has here fallen into the common error of conclud- 
ing that since Mr. Noyes is a very prolific poet he is 
therefore a careless or bungling craftsman. 

If Mr. Payne were asked to be more specific in his 
statement, I suppose he would say that Noyes uses too 
many irregular lines, for instance, iambic lines in 
which trochees or anapoests occur, and that he is too 
prone to let imperfect rhymes creep into his work. Of 
course anybody familiar with Mr. Noyes's poetry will 
grant that he is pretty free in his use of irregularities; 
but I have yet to find him using an irregular line which 



does not either relieve mechanical monotony or produce 
some particular effect which he seeks. Furthermore, I 
challenge any critic to find in his work a dozen harsh 
or limping lines. 

As regards Mr. Noyes's carelessness with rhymes, it 
must be admitted that imperfect rhymes are by no 
means uncommon in his pages. But what about the 
rhymes of the impeccable Tennyson himself ? Were 
it not for such " accidentals " as " love-prove," " fear- 
bear," " boast-lost," " now-low," " curse-horse," 
"Christ-mist," "words-chords," and a score of others, 
Tennyson's "In Memoriam " would be an intolerably 
wearisome and mechanical poem. Imperfect rhymes 
are as essential to good poetry as occasional sharps and 
flats are to good music. 

Mr. Noyes may not be quite so finished an artist as 
Tennyson, but he certainly approaches even Tennyson 
in art. A bard capable of the sustained grandeur of 
"Drake," the intricate melody of "The Barrel-Organ," 
the glorious and unfailing onomatopoeia of " Flos 
Mercatorum," and the enchanting loveliness of "Oxford 
Re-visited," is, to say the least, a technician of the first 

order - H. H. PECKHAM.

"PROGRAMME" AND "PROGRUM." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I see that in your latest issue you continue your war 
on the movement to improve English spelling. Will you 
kindly allow me space in your valuable journal to offer 
a few suggestions ? 

Are you sure it is " carelessness " that leads the 
reformers to make their recommendations ? Is it not 
rather a desire to be careful, orderly, and logical, to 
profit by the maxim that "lazy folks take the most 
pains " by removing some of the painful consequences 
of the laziness of our ancestors ? The personal char- 
acter of the reformers would seem to favor the latter 
assumption. The great strength of the reform move- 
ment lies in the fact that it has drawn to its banners so 
many of our scholars, than whom no class of citizens 
are more distinguished for disinterested and painstaking 
effort. It has also appealed to a large number of our 
best political and commercial leaders. It has even 
found advocates among the poets, the class to whom 
one might suppose the shock of novelty would be least 
tolerable. Richard Watson Gilder was on the Simpli- 
fied Spelling Board, and Walter Savage Landor was a 
precursor of it. Is there any artistic advantage in con- 
fusing the beautiful with the merely familiar ? Is there 
any aesthetic advantage in the conventional spelling 
of such words as " through," " rough," " furlough," 
"phthisic," "phlegm," "ptarmigan," and a thousand 
others ? 

There is real difficulty in the spelling " program " 
and the pronunciation "progrum." But is not the diffi- 
culty due to the spelling-books of many generations, 
which have taught us that English spelling and English 
pronunciation need not have any striking relation to 
each other ? Is not the spelling " program " at worst 
a case where the difficulty has not been wholly removed, 
a mere and partial exception to the rule that the 
reformers are trying and, to judge by the papers, 
successfully trying to introduce a truer agreement 
between the written and the spoken language ?

A GREATLY-GIFTED NATURALIST.* 

Brilliantly-gifted son of an illustrious father, 
Alexander Agassiz is less known to the world at 
large because instead of being a teacher and a 
popularizer of science, as was Louis Agassiz, he 
chose to devote himself to the rigors of research. 
Long ago it was declared by the naturalist, 
Jeffries Wyman, who died in 1874, that the 
younger Agassiz had already done more for the 
advancement of pure science than had his famous 
father. If that was true nearly forty years 
before the death of him to whom the assertion 
referred, how much more emphatically true it 
must have become when he ceased his labors in 
1910, after a long life of unflagging devotion 
to his chosen studies ! 

An adequate conception of the fulness and 
richness of that life of varied industry in the 
large domain of natural science, and of remark- 
able achievement also outside its limits, is what 
comparatively few, even of those who had some 
acquaintance with Alexander Agassiz, have ever 
had the opportunity or taken the trouble to gain. 
But in the volume now prepared by his son, Mr. 
George R. Agassiz, and entitled " Letters and 
Recollections of Alexander Agassiz, with a 
Sketch of his Life and Work," the man is pre- 
sented to the public in some completeness of 
view, with a more than merely filial sympathy 
with the subject of the work, and in a manner 
likely to engage the interest of a wide circle of 
readers. The nature and difficulties of the task 
so satisfactorily accomplished by the biographer 
are thus hinted at in his introductory paragraph : 

" Any one who attempts to present a faithful impres- 
sion of Alexander Agassiz's life is confronted with un- 
usual difficulties, for his versatile and restless energy 
covered a very extraordinarily wide field, and his per- 
sonality was so large that we are hampered in our view 
of him by our own limitations. The morphologist con- 
siders his earlier work the most important; the geolo- 
gist, that his reputation rests chiefly on his extensive 
investigations of coral reefs; the zoologist remembers 
his vast collections of marine life gathered in a dozen 
extended voyages widely scattered over the surface of 
the globe; and to still others he appears as the creator 
of a vast museum and one of the greatest benefactors of 
the oldest university in America; while those who delve 
among ancient civilizations and primitive races might 
well be surprised at the extent of his poaching in their 
preserves, a mere detour in his many wanderings in the 
pursuit of science or search of health. In the world of

affairs he was known as an extremely capable and suc- 
cessful mining man, who was said to employ his leisure 
moments in some sort of scientific study." 

Originally purposing to let his father tell his 
own story in letters and other autobiographical 
material, the son soon found this impossible 
because so much of the requisite correspondence 
had been destroyed. Moreover, as he says, it 
is " a much more difficult matter to make a 
characteristic collection of letters now than it 
was in past generations. D'autres temps, 
d'autres moeurs ; to-day we no longer keep 
trunks full of old letters stored in our attics, 
nor do we write the leisurely and carefully- 
penned epistles of our forefathers, while the 
roomy lofts that harbored them have vanished." 
Therefore, though modestly willing to resign in 
favor of " a more experienced biographer," Mr. 
Agassiz at last found himself compelled to fill 
in, with his own hand, the many and wide gaps 
left in the naturalist's own account of his in- 
dustrious and richly fruitful life. How capably 
this Boswellian function has been performed will 
become apparent as we proceed with the present 
review, which however will leave the greater 
part of the book's merits to be discovered by 
the readers of its pages. 

Neuchatel, where Louis Agassiz settled as 
professor of natural history soon after his mar- 
riage to the talented Cecile Braun, daughter 
of a village schoolmaster devoted in his leisure 
hours to natural science, was the birthplace of 
Alexander, the eldest child and only son of the 
family. He was born December 17, 1835, and 
seems from the first to have shown more of his 
mother's characteristics of temperament than of 
his father's. In this connection his son says of 
the two men: 

" The very general belief that men of unusual abilities 
inherit many of their qualities from their mothers offers 
a ready explanation for the marked difference in the 
character of Louis Agassiz and his son. Alexander 
inherited from him a love of science and an extraor- 
dinary ability and thirst for work; but his sensitive and 
apprehensive temperament he acquired directly from 
his mother. 

" Naturally it has been sometimes the habit to com- 
pare the two men. But beyond the fact that both had 
a passionate love of science, pursued by very similar 
methods of work, and that the son followed in the foot- 
steps of the father in developing the Museum that the 
latter had founded, they had less in common than might 
be supposed. The father's optimism was always a cause 
of anxiety and trouble; the son possessed a singularly 
clear sight for the rocks ahead, and a very marked 
ability to steer his course clear of them. The habits 
of thought of each were necessarily different. Louis 
was the last of the great naturalists who believed in the 
special creation of species, and the theological tenets 
that it implied. Alexander, though always extremely

THE DIAL,

cautious in any speculations that did not rest on a solid 
foundation of ascertained fact, passed his early scientific 
life under the stimulus that the teachings of Darwin 
gave to a new school of science." 

Marked indeed was the contrast between the 
buoyant and robust elder Agassiz, open and 
expansive in his nature, loving appreciation, 
fond of teaching, and possessed of a veritable 
genius for kindling his pupils and his hearers 
with something of his own enthusiasm, and the 
reticent, undemonstrative, vigilantly-controlled 
manner of the son. All the more memorable, 
therefore, were the latter's rare indulgences in 
free expression of his feelings. Characteristic 
of the future man was the Swiss schoolboy's 
revolt against the Prussian governor of the 
canton of Neuchatel, which he and a band of 
like-minded playmates wished to see enrolled, 
as in fact it was enrolled a few years later, 
with the other cantons in the Swiss confederacy. 
The story of his refusal to salute the hated 
tyrant and of his scornful rejection of the school 
prizes conferred upon him by his teachers, but 
offered through the governor's hands, is signifi- 
cant as well as amusing. His biographer says 
of him: 

" Do men mature faster in the shadow of the Alps, 
that certain qualities, which made such a marked and 
distinguished personality of the man, were already so 
evident in the boy ? For this quiet youth already 
possessed an unusual power of concentration, and a gift 
of accomplishing what he intended to do. The thor- 
oughness and ease with which he worked, his great 
reserve, his sudden explosions of indignation, his quiet 
and entire devotion to those he loved, his occasional out- 
bursts of mirth, as delightful as they were unexpected, 
his unfailing charm, all these belonged to the Swiss 
boy no less than to the scientific man of cosmopolitan 
friendship and fame." 

It was in his fourteenth year, soon after his 
mother's death, that the boy Alexander followed 
his father to America and entered that strange 
household in Cambridge which, until the fortu- 
nate coming of a second mother to him and his 
sisters, consisted of Professor Agassiz, "a dear 
old artist, Mr. Burkhardt, a young Harvard 
student, Mr. Edward King, an old Swiss min- 
ister called 'Papa Christinat,' who was supposed 
to look after the housekeeping, a bear, some 
eagles, a crocodile, a few snakes, and sundry 
other live stock." In the autumn of 1851 the 
young immigrant entered Harvard, "at the age 
of fifteen and a half," writes his biographer, 
but he must have been nearer sixteen, which 
was certainly young enough even in that early 
time. Among his classmates were not a few 
destined to become well known, such as E. H. 
Abbot, K. T. Paine, F. B. Sanborn, Theodore 



Lyman, J. K. Hosmer, Judges Mitchell and 
Seawell, Bishop Phillips Brooks, and Francis 
C. Barlow, "the first scholar of the class, who 
entered the Civil War a private, and left it a 
major-general." Of these men, Professor Hos- 
mer, in his " Last Leaf," has given us a pleasing 
glimpse of his gifted classmate. Whole-hearted 
application to both work and play seems to have 
marked his college course; but as he devoted 
himself more eagerly to certain researches out- 
side the curriculum than to some of the less 
congenial studies within it, and as he was espe- 
cially zealous in perfecting his skill as an oars- 
man, he was graduated only twenty-fourth in a 
class of eighty-two. But in a subsequent course 
at the Lawrence Scientific School he acquitted 
himself brilliantly. 

The work of his manhood in various depart- 
ments of natural history, in building up the 
great museum founded by his father, in guiding 
the fortunes of the Calumet and Hecla mining 
enterprise, in conducting expeditions for scien- 
tific research, and in other activities contribut- 
ing to the advancement of science or the enrich- 
ment of human knowledge, is either already 
known to those interested, or may be followed 
in detail in his own writings and in the biog- 
raphy now offered to the public. The story of 
Calumet and Hecla, as wonderful as a chapter 
of " Monte Cristo," but also not without grim 
details of what almost proved to be failure and 
ruin, forms one of the most interesting portions 
of the book. It is followed by accounts of " the 
revision of the echini," the visit to LakeTiticaca, 
the Newport laboratory, the three cruises of the 
"Blake," work in Mexico and India, wander- 
ings elsewhere, the first "Albatross " expedition, 
studies of coral reefs, researches in the Bahamas 
and the Bermudas, on the Great Barrier Reef, 
among the Fijis and elsewhere in the southern 
Pacific, Agassiz's later years, and, finally, his 
eastern Pacific expedition. 

The tough two years in the Michigan wilder- 
tested the man's resourcefulness and 



ness 



stamina as probably no later experience did, 
and it also broke his health and left him with 
a lurking disease to fight against for the rest of 
his life. He had already seen something of coal- 
mining as president of certain mines in Pennsyl- 
vania which his friend, John M. Forbes, had 
succeeded in having placed under his manage- 
ment, but the conditions in northern Michigan 
were new to him and probably unprecedented. 
This is the way he spoke of his proposed 
undertaking to the future head of Harvard 
University :

" Eliot, I am going to Michigan for some years as 
superintendent of the Calumet and Hecla Mines. I 
want to make money; it is impossible to be a produc- 
tive naturalist in this country without money. I am 
going to get some money if I can, and then I will be 
a naturalist. If I succeed, I can then get my own 
papers and drawings printed and help my father at the 
Museum." 

How well he succeeded, and what excellent 
and unselfish use he made of the wealth he won, 
will all be found, with many other important 
matters, in the son's careful and sympathetic 
biography of his many-sided father. Both the 
specialist in science and the general reader 
interested in the development of a singularly 
strong and variously gifted character will 
heartily enjoy the work. In portraits, views, 
maps, colored drawings, index, and other 
features, the book is all that could be desired.

FINDING THE TRUTH OF THINGS.* 



"The World Soul" is a queer book an 
amusing, amazing, suggestive, tantalizing, much- 
promising and little-satisfying, sophomoric, pro 
phetic book. 

To begin at the beginning, the title is pre- 
judicial. And the prejudice is almost justified. 
For though there are plenty of definite, concrete 
things in the book, the title and all pertaining 
directly thereto remain a bit of non-luminous 
and non-caloric rhetoric. Even the glossary, 
introduced for the benefit of those who are not 
familiar with the terminology of Mr. Fielding- 
Hall's system, avails nothing. " Soul " is defined 
as "emotion," and "world" is made identical 
with "trinity." The Trinity is composed of 
Nature, Soul, and Wisdom. So "World Soul " 
is mathematically the emotion of Nature, Emo- 
tion, and Wisdom. Simple cancellation makes 
Nature and Wisdom equal zero, a lamentable 
conclusion. Mere vagueness will no longer be 
cashed in for profundity. 

Another feature that may disparage the real 
value of the book is the author's cool assurance 
that he has exhausted knowledge and completed 
wisdom. Even though "The World Soul " had 
done this considerable thing, it would behoove 
the writer not to be so fully conscious of it. 

" It has been my good fortune to live a life of 
extraordinary variety. There are few things I have not 
felt or seen, few occupations I have not tried or been 
connected with, few things I have not done, few coun- 

* THE WORLD SOUL. By H. Fielding-Hall. New York:

tries I have not visited, few classes of people I have 
not known, few notable books I have not read." 

In the preface we read : " What I am con- 
cerned to do is to find the exact truth of things, 
and to connect them into a coherent whole." 
This is a pretty large order, but we are gratified 
to note that the author has been able to fill it : 

" So far I had come. By working diligently all my 
life, by asking, by seeking, by knocking, I had discov- 
ered a great many things, and I knew that all I had 
discovered was true." 

" Then suddenly a thought touched my heart, it 
shook, and all things flashed into being. Every vague 
wandering thought that had gone from sight came back 
in new organic form. I saw all that I had wanted to 
see for so many years." 

It is not surprising to learn that since the time 
mentioned above he has "been lonesome" in 
his thinking. The suspensive art with which 
he promises, pointing ahead to some delectable 
revelation, is worthy of "Tom Jones" itself. 
And so no wonder one closes the book disap- 
pointed; for, expecting a cloud-burst, one re- 
sents the scarcity of really good showers. 

It may be well to quote a rather extended 
passage from the first chapter in order to give 
the author's point of view. The following will 
serve admirably : 

" Jesus the World Thinker was in the world to think 
for it, and to tell it whence it came and whither it was 
bound; how so to live as to accelerate that purpose 
which is in the world and for the world; but with one 
exception the writer of the fourth Gospel no one 
even partially understood. The life of Jesus and his 
thought were misinterpreted. From out of his teach- 
ings a few simple truths were taken; all the rest were 
misinterpreted, and thought was once more fossilised 
and dead. All research was persecuted and destroyed. 

" The very little that was partially understood of 
what Jesus was and said was hidden in a mass of super- 
stition, and called Christianity. This was the faith that 
I was taught when young. Briefly, it is this: 

" A God all-powerful, all-wise, all-loving, made the 
world, no one knows for why. It is a failure, full of 
misery, sin, and suffering. So he sent His Son to save 
it by his blood, because God had to be propitiated for 
the sin of His own creation. Jesus was born of miracle, 
lived in miracle, died in miracle, a denial of God's own 
rule of law. He taught that the world is evil, and we 
must escape from it. We must be innocent and pure, 
abjure the world, and when we die those who succeed 
will go to heaven to live for ever uselessly because 
they are unfit for any work, and there is no work to do. 
The majority will burn in hell. Their symbol is that 
of death, a crucifix or cross. 

" I did not believe a word of it. 

" Even as a boy I saw instinctively and very dimly a 
great many things. 

" No God would sacrifice His Son to Himself. He 
might send His Son to war knowing he would be killed. 
That is a different matter. But in that case how could 
He be all-mighty ? 

" I saw that the world was beautiful, and that if it

was not entirely happy it was because of defects which 
existed to be overcome, for the whole value of life lay 
in overcoming them and going on. ... I didn't want 
to go to either heaven or hell. I wanted life, and so 
did all others I knew." 

This passage will orientate the book, attracting 
or repelling the reader. It will be seen that the 
author's arraignment of Christianity is slightly 
unfair; nevertheless, many thoughtful Chris- 
tians will feel that the exaggeration is but venial. 

The first half of the work is devoted to a his- 
tory of his own thought development, some of 
it fresh and some of it stale; and a resume of 
his former books, which it is to be presumed 
are very much more diffuse than the present 
culminating volume. They are, " The Soul of a 
People," "The Hearts of Men," "A People at 
School," "The Inward Light," "One Immor- 
tality," and " The Sons of Time." 

The chief value of this book although such 
value appears to be incidental is the human- 
izing light thrown upon the life of Jesus. 
Utterly freed from the trammels of creedal 
Christianity, Mr. Fielding-Hall professes and 
manifests the utmost reverence, amounting to 
worship, for Jesus. To those who find comfort 
in the humanity of Jesus, in his appeal as a 
brother in an actual and not a mystical sense, 
and are unable to appreciate his vicarious serv- 
ices as a god, there will be much pleasure and 
illumination in the later chapters, especially 
that entitled "Crucifixion." The view herein 
presented, while not novel, exhibits many orig- 
inal features in its details. It is in brief that 
Jesus was "neurotic" (an atrociously infelic- 
itous word). He did not die on the cross in 
three hours, but fainted. His appearances later 
were thus entirely natural, and his early death 
soon after was just as naturally caused by the 
tremendous shock he had experienced. This is 
not all thoroughly consistent and satisfactory, 
notably the supposition that Philip, the writer 
of the Fourth Gospel and the only disciple who 
had any intellectual sympathy for Jesus, knew 
all the time that Jesus had not died. Still 
there is immense suggestiveness in the chapter, 
enough to make the writer's promise of a life 
of Jesus very welcome. 

There are certain surprising omissions, con- 
sidering the point of view and the frank, simple, 
unfrilled way of thinking on these questions 
that the author follows. He handles the birth 
and death of Jesus directly and without reserve ; 
on the other hand he nowhere makes mention 
of the stupendous fact that Jesus, whom he con- 
ceives to be the type and contain the essence of 
humanity, our brother, tempted and joyinp- and 



sorrowing in all points as we are tempted and 
joy and suffer, lacked the most vital human 
experiences. He was a celibate. I suppose it 
is a biological truism that marriage and parent- 
hood test the capacity of human joy and sorrow 
as nothing else in life can. Celibate thinkers 
have here and there been great, but have always 
been incomplete. However high and deep and 
broad their ken, there has been a height and 
depth and breadth unreached. "They twain 
shall be one flesh" is a literal biological law. 
A differentiated sex is disinherited from some 
of life's original knowledge ; to realize complete 
wisdom sex must be added to sex. A perfectly 
happy unmarried Shakespeare or Lincoln would 
have been distinctly less ; a perfectly unhappy, 
unmarried Browning would not have been much. 
It remains to say that for the most part the 
author seems keen, honest, unfettered, and un- 
fettering. His style is simple, clear, and strik- 
ing wherever his hobby of the World Soul is in 
the background. He may not have solved all 
mysteries, but that is not greatly to be regretted. 
There would be no heritage of mystery for the 
future if " The World Soul " had paid all claims.

THE INTERPRETATION OF RUSSIA.* 



The increasing prominence of the Slav in 
the affairs of Europe has drawn the attention of 
the world more and more to the great Russian 
Empire, almost three times the size of the 
United States, which is destined beyond doubt 
to play a most important part in the history of 
the next century. For many reasons Russia 
has been little known to the Western world. 
The ordinary tourist goes southward or halts 
well within the boundaries of Germany, and 
cares little for the remote and "barbarous" 
Scythians. The severe winters repel, and 
travel is not always easy and pleasant, as it 
has become elsewhere. But recent events have 
shown us that we must know more about the 
great Sphinx of Eastern Europe, and be able 
to judge her opinions and her diplomacy on the 
basis of wider and more exact knowledge.

dent of " The London Standard," has enjoyed

exceptional opportunities and privileges, and 
has made good use of them. In "My Russian 
Year" he has produced an impartial account 
of the Russian character, and has drawn vivid 
pictures of life among several different classes 
in the Empire. He records few statistics but 
many conversations. He had apparently no 
special interests ; he saw both town and country 
life, both reactionaries and revolutionists, peas- 
ants and nobility, Jews and orthodox. In 
Russia all extremes appear to meet. One sees 
there all the centuries illustrated. 

" If one wants to know what sort of man an Anglo- 
Saxon villain was, it is more to the point to talk to a 
Russian peasant than to rummage in libraries. The 
pilgrims, dressed like Tannhauser in the third act, with 
staves in their hands and wallets at their sides, who 
wander through Russia on their way to pray at the 
Holy Sepulchre, belong to the age of the Crusades. 
The ascetic who spends his life in prayer and fasting 
and wears chains about his body, seems to have found 
his way into modern Russia from the Egyptian Thebaid 
of the fourth century. A country lad tells me that all 
Russians who are not orthodox are wicked persons, 
that Poles must be Catholics and Englishmen members 
of the English Church, and I realize that I am speaking 
to a contemporary of Queen Elizabeth. I spent a week 
in Livland with people of the eighteenth century." 

In his effort to make the reader see Russia 
vividly, as he himself saw it, we think Mr. 
Reynolds has succeeded. From a volume every 
chapter of which is full of interesting comment 
and of color, it is not easy to single out topics 
for discussion. We must not fail, however, to 
notice the chapter on "The Reactionaries." 
These are the men who have not perceived the 
tendency of the times, who have fondly believed 
that the alien races now subject to the Czar 
can be made to do exactly as did the Russians 
of old. Their aim is "to force every subject 
of the Russian Tsar to speak the language he 
speaks, to believe the creed he believes, to pray 
the prayers he prays." There are not many, 
to be sure, who hold such extreme views as 
these ; yet there are, as Mr. Reynolds points 
out, many Conservatives "who approve the 
present system of government, and, although 
they may desire reforms, are opposed to the 
introduction of wider liberties." Thus it re- 
sults that Stolypin's policy of order first, then 
reform, is upheld by large numbers of the peo- 
ple, and "Stolypin's Necktie" (the hangman's 
rope) continues to play a large part in the 
administration of the government. The chap- 
ter on "The Revolutionists" ought to be read 
and pondered by the militant suffragettes. 
Doing evil that good may come never has suc- 
ceeded and never will succeed. The terrorists 
in Russia have themselves to thank for the 



presence of the hated secret police; moreover, 
they have delayed reform for many decades, if 
not for centuries. 

Mr. Winter's volume is the most comprehen- 
sive and ambitious of the four. In twenty-six 
chapters, filling 465 pages, he essays a descrip- 
tion of Russian ethnology, geography, litera- 
ture, history, and customs truly "a large 
order." Had he attempted less, he would 
doubtless have made a better book. He seems 
to have become a professional in this sort, hav- 
ing to his credit works bearing a similar title 
on Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil, Argentina, and 
Chile. This is therefore his first venture on 
European soil. His style shows a woeful lack of 
training. Such gems as these occur : " He looks 
like he was pneumatically inflated" (p. 28); "he 
was as meek a looking fellow as one could 
find" (p. Ill); "the people could not be en- 
thused as formerly" (p. 80); "it was blamed 
upon a Jew " (p. 258) ; " The shopkeepers do 
not seem overly anxious for customers " (p. 30). 
The description is quite devoid of enthusiasm 
and as a rule is most matter-of-fact. Yet it 
must be conceded that Mr. Winter has a fairly 
good sense of proportion, and has well martialed 
his masses of facts. He has travelled widely 
in European Russia, and knows well the country 
as it appears to-day. In commenting on the 
abrogation by Congress of the Treaty of 1832, 
Mr. Winter has this to say: 

" The Russian has a logical answer to the protest 
of the United States. Our country will not admit 
polygamists, and yet Russia has thousands of polyga- 
mous subjects, and millions of Mohammedans, who at 
heart believe in the principle of plural marriages. 
There are likewise tens of thousands of Chinese who 
are subjects of the Czar. ' Now,' says the Russian, 'if 
you will not admit our polygamists or Chinese, how can 
you insist on our admitting your Jews ? ' It is an 
unanswerable argument. . . . The United States can 
gain nothing, nor will the Jew, either in this country 
or Russia, be benefitted." 

The action of Congress, which looks like a 
diplomatic blunder, was doubtless based on in- 
sufficient knowledge of Russian conditions and 
habits of thought. As Dr. Andrew D. White 
lately remarked to the present reviewer in a 
conversation, it cannot fail to have a disastrous 
effect on the peace movement. 

Mr. Rappoport has given us a substantial 
and worthy volume. In twenty-two chapters, 
of which fourteen are devoted to the country 
and the remainder to the town, he presents a 
series of pictures and observations which well 
set forth the private life of the Russians. He 
is not wholly systematic ; the four or five pages 
of notes are important and certainly ought to

have been amplified and incorporated into the 
text. Nor is he very consistent in spelling 
proper names : thus we find moujik (generally) 
and Moushik (p. v.); Alexejewith (p. 211), 
Wassilevitsh (p. 55), Stepanowitsh (p. 148), 
Puschkin(p.l2); russaeki (for russalki,p. 48), 
and roussalki (pp. 62ff.); Tolstoi (pp. 86, 
203), and Tolstoy (p. 141). Mr. Rappoport 
writes, however, compactly and directly. Among 
his most interesting chapters are those on stu- 
dent life and on the secret police. The strug- 
gles of many a Russian youth to gain an 
education are full of pathos. 

" Thousands of Russian students are absolutely with- 
out means of any description, and keep body and soul 
together by giving a few lessons, and it takes a great 
deal of perseverance to carry on the struggle undeterred 
under such wretched conditions. It is easy to conceive 
that these conditions lead those least capable of resist- 
ance to a radicalism which recognizes no limits to good 
or evil, to a state of revolt against the existing order of 
things which is not always the result of meditation and 
reflection, but of an empty stomach and a bitter spirit." 

It is no wonder that many students soon land 
in prison or in Siberia betrayed perhaps by 
their bosom friends who were really of the 
secret police. There is little hope for Russia 
as long as the autocracy continues its present 
fatal policy, which paralyzes all independent 
thought on political or social questions. 

From these distressing thoughts one turns 
with something like relief to wanderings by 
the pleasant shores of the Black Sea, remote 
from the centre of despotic rule. Mr. Stephen 
Graham, already known as an entertaining 
writer on Russian topics through his "Vagabond 
in the Caucasus" and "Undiscovered Russia," 
now adds to the list an illuminating series 
of studies and reflections which he entitles 
" Changing Russia." Its framework is the nar- 
rative of a pedestrian journey from Rostof-on- 
the-Don to Batum, along the route of the new 
Black Sea Railway. Mingled with descriptions 
of scenery and of various types of humanity 
are found chapters on colonization and politics, 
journalism, hopes for a new national art, and 
the Russian imperial policy. On all these sub- 
jects Mr. Graham writes intelligently and with 
neither illusions nor despair. For the Russian 
bourgeois he has supreme contempt. 

" The curse of Russia, and, as the years go on, the 
increasing curse, is the bourgeoisie, the lower middle 
class, aware of itself articulately as the lower intelli- 
gentia. It is forming everywhere in the towns as a 
result of the commercial development of the nation. 
They are worse than the English middle class, worse 
than the Forsytes, because they wish to be considered 
national. They are of the race who ' limerick ' and 
treasure-hunt, but are not occupied so innocently. In 



politics they call themselves Liberals, though they have 
no notion of true Liberalism, they are seldom Socialists 
or Radicals, but are abusive of those in authority. 
They are unwilling, however, to sacrifice anything or 
take any risks for political ends. Through them the 
revolution failed; they would have liked the revolution 
to have succeeded, but as they had not the faith of the 
true revolutionaries, they waited to see who would win. 
Selfish as it is possible to be, crass, heavy, ugly, unfaith- 
ful in marriage, unclean, impure, incapable apparently 
of understanding the good and the true in their neigh- 
bours and in life such is the Russian bourgeois." 

To offset this picture, there is the portrait of 
Vassily Vassil'itch, a type of the higher intelli- 
gentia immaculate, courteous, religious, eager 
for the best thoughts. The number of this type 
can hardly be large, and we wonder whether 
they will do much toward stemming the tide of 
gross materialism which seems bound to sweep 
over the country and which has already begun 
to spoil the peasantry. This is perhaps the 
main burden of Mr. Graham's thought that 
Russia is losing her faith in the church and 
religion, and for the mass of the people nothing 
is in sight to replace it except faith in the 
rouble. That Russia is about to pass through 
the same experience of the domination of Phil- 
istinism which England and America have had 
for many years, seems inevitable. That the 
Philistines cannot be killed off, as in Kouprin's 
striking skit in " Satirikon " (translated by Mr. 
Graham, pp. 103ff.), is unfortunately certain. 
Yet that culture will triumph in the end we 
may hope with some degree of confidence ; for 
the dollar and the rouble will not always sat- 
isfy, and sooner or later the children of light 
will come into their own.

PHASES AND PROBLEMS OF IMMIGRATION.* 

Despite the masses of books, monographs, public 
documents, and magazine articles relating to the 
subject (not to mention the almost inescapable 
opportunities for personal contact and observa- 
tion), the average American has yet much to learn 
regarding the origins, causes, and character of the 
settlement of the foreign-born in our midst. And 
the most important fact which he has yet to grasp

[Sept. 16 



is that the immigration with which our own country 
is directly concerned is but a phase of a world phe- 
nomenon, to be understood and to be dealt with 
satisfactorily only in the light of this phenomenon 
as a whole. French and German students of social 
movements have very generally been able to take 
the larger view ; and some, as Re'ne' Gonnard, have 
written illuminatingly under its influence. But 
Americans, at least the Americans who have be- 
come the authors of immigration treatises, have 
almost universally failed to catch it, so that it 
becomes a genuine pleasure to record the fact that 
in one of the several American books recently 
published upon the subject the much-to-be-desired 
quality is at last to be discovered. The author of 
this book is Professor Fairchild, of Yale University, 
whose excellent study of "Greek Immigration in 
the United States" was reviewed some time ago in 
these columns. 

Disclaiming the purpose to attempt exhaustive- 
ness of detail, Professor Fairchild seeks in his new 
book to portray the immigration question as it pre- 
sents itself in this country as " a part of an inclusive 
conservation program for all humanity." The fun- 
damental matters, he affirms, 

" are the laws or principles which underlie the great type 
of population movement which we call immigration. . . . 
It is a knowledge of these principles which fits one to under- 
stand the movement in its ever-changing aspects, and to 
grapple with it as a problem of practical politics or sociology. 
To define and clarify the concepts involved, to set forth 
clearly the laws and principles, and to point out the oppor- 
tunities and responsibilities, is the chief aim of this book.' 1 

Upon hardly any sociological subject has writing 
been generally more loose, slovenly, and lacking in 
perspective. The accuracy, conciseness, and balance 
of Professor Fairchild's work are accordingly most 
refreshing. There is a good deal of history and a 
certain amount of statistical information, but the 
larger portion of the volume is taken up with a 
study of sources, causes, attending conditions, and 
results, viewed not exclusively as bearing upon the 
American problem but as aspects of a worldwide 
international conflict of social and economic forces. 

From the vantage point thus occupied the author 
is able to demonstrate effectively the fallacy of the 
popular notion that belief in immigration restriction 
is inconsistent with sympathy for the immigrant. 
He proves, indeed, that the restrictionist may be 
the alien's truest friend. The changes of condition 
during recent decades, in America and abroad, are 
shown to be at least so extensive as to require that 
"the entire immigration situation be considered in the 
light of present conditions, rather than of past history. The 
old stock arguments, pro and con, which seem to have stood 
the test of time, need to be thoroughly reviewed. The 
modern immigrant must be viewed in the setting of to-day. 
Especially must it be borne in mind that the fact if such 
it be that immigration in the past has worked no injury 
to the nation, and has resulted in good to the immigrants, 
by no means indicates that a continuance of past policy and 
practice in the matter will entail no serious evil conse- 
quences, nor bring about disaster in the future." 

No special plea is made for restriction or the 



reverse; but it is insisted that the mind of the 
country upon this vital question should be made 
up from a full knowledge of the conditions to-day 
actually involved, not from the assumptions, nor 
even the facts, of seventy-five or twenty-five years 
ago. 

The sweep of Dr. Warne's "The Immigrant 
Invasion " is less extensive. The subject is viewed 
in its American aspects almost exclusively. The 
major portion of the volume is taken up with a 
survey of the distribution, present character, and 
effects of immigration, and the more or less familiar 
facts are presented with commendable clearness and 
concreteness. The review of immigrant distribution, 
especially with respect to the South, is useful. An 
attempt is made to forecast in some detail the im- 
migration movement of the nearer future. The 
conclusion is reached that in Germany, the Scandi- 
navian countries, and Great Britain and Ireland 
the principal sources of the older immigration the 
economic and political influences at present at work 
will operate to produce a continued decline in emigra- 
tion to the United States. 

" The economic opportunities of those who might emigrate 
from these countries are now nearly as great as they are in 
the United States. These opportunities, once so widely 
apart, have more nearly approached a level. This has 
come about through an improvement of conditions in these 
European countries and by a relative decline in the pros- 
pects of the immigrant in the United States he no longer 
has before him here the chance for economic independence 
through land ownership." 

On the other hand, it is pointed out that the 
immigrant tide from the countries of southern and 
eastern Europe is likely to rise to still higher levels. 
The reason is stated convincingly as follows: 

"The United States has only just begun the development 
of her material resources by means of industrial organiza- 
tion. Into the foundation of this organization our captains 
of industry seem to have successfully built, for a long time 
to come at least, a very low wage a wage too low to sup- 
port decently and comfortably the native worker. Our gov- 
ernmental organization or political state has so far been pow- 
erless to prevent this. Our manufacturers have even begun to 
use our governmental machinery in their campaign to capture 
the markets of the world. This competition in world mar- 
kets must meet a low wage and in consequence the demand 
of the American manufacturer for cheap labor will not only 
continue in the future but it will also most likely become 
even more insistent. Governmental action to prevent this 
anti-social demand from becoming effective, such for instance 
as the restriction of immigration by Congress, is very unlikely. 
In consequence we shall not be surprised if immigration for 
the coming years is of even greater volume than that of the 
past decade and more. The larger part of it virtually all 
of it must come from the eastern and southern and western 
Asiatic countries, where the standard of living of the masses 
is very little, if any. above the mere cost of the coarsest sub- 
sistence. Unless effective restrictive measures are enacted 
by Congress, this immigration will continue indefinitely until 
more of an equilibrium is established between the economic 
rewards to toilers in those countries and in the United States. 
This result can come about only through a slow and gradual 
process of economic adjustment, in the meantime continuing 
here among our own citizen-workers a low wage and in 
consequence a low standard of living." 

Dr. Warne clearly favors a policy of restriction 
somewhat more rigid than that at present in opera- 



1913] 



THE DIAL

tion, but he believes also that the forces of sympathy 
for the ambitious alien and of self-interest on the 
part of the American employer are likely to prove 
too powerful to permit the enactment of legislation 
establishing such restriction. It is his opinion, too, 
that the opening of the Panama Canal will inaugu- 
rate such an influx of Europeans on the Pacific 
coast that the immigration question in that section 
of the country will assume a wholly novel phase; 
and the question is raised whether the opposition to 
the coming in of laborers of an inferior standard of 
living, even though of non- Asiatic origin, may prove 
sufficiently strong in that section to induce the adop- 
tion of a federal policy regarding the Hungarian, 
the Slav, and the Italian similar to that at present 
operative respecting the Chinese and the Japanese. 
The book contains some helpful charts and tables. 
The bibliography which is appended, however, is so 
scant and haphazard as to be of small worth. Mr. 
James Ford Rhodes is cited, justly, as a high au- 
thority; but there is no reason for referring to him 
as Professor Rhodes. 

In "The New Immigration," Dr. Roberts presents 
a detailed survey of the human qualities, industrial 
efficiency, and social life of the masses of immigrants 
from southeastern Europe who during the past three 
or four decades have sought employment and homes 
in the United States. In the volume there is little 
of theory but much of carefully ascertained and 
clearly stated fact; in truth, it abounds, perhaps 
above all other books ever published within the field, 
in specific incidents and illustrations which serve to 
humanize the subject. The view of the author is 
optimistic. It is recognized that large-scale immi- 
gration, under even the most favorable of circum- 
stances, has its darker side; but it is insisted that 
America needs the immigrant hardly less than the 
immigrant needs America; that the immigration at 
present under way from Italy, Austria-Hungary, 
and adjacent countries comprises in no true sense 
the "scum of the earth"; and that, despite the 
imperfect realization of the problem of assimilation 
which has been arrived at, a variety of assimilative 
forces are already yielding results which are little 
short of marvellous. 

" I believe in the immigrant. He has in him the making of 
an American, provided a sympathetic hand guides him and 
smooths the path -which leads to assimilation. The hand of 
the native-born can best do this; and my main thesis is, that 
in every community where the men of southeastern Europe 
have settled the redemptive forces necessary to raise the 
foreigners from inefficiency and ignorance, from anti-social 
habits and gross superstition, are available, provided they 
are marshalled, supported, and set to work by patriotic men. 
Wherever the native-born lie supinely, looking to state or 
federal government for relief from the ills precipitated by 
foreigners, their expectation will not be fulfilled, and the ills 
they bemoan will grow more intense. . . . The past indus- 
trial development of America points unerringly to Europe 
as the source whence our future unskilled labor supply is 
to be drawn. The gates will not be closed ; the wheels of 
industry will not retard ; America is in the race for the 
markets of the world; its call for workers will not cease. 
Confronted by these conditions, is it not the duty of the 



government to deal generously and justly by those who 
answer the call, and should not every industrial community 
adopt some definite plan for constructive work to raise the 
standard of the new immigration and speed on the process 
of assimilation ? " 

The effectiveness of the assimilative process, in 
Dr. Roberts's opinion, must depend more largely 
upon private effort than upon legislation. It is 
especially recommended that in every city, town, 
and village where immigrants have settled, public 
buildings be utilized for special educational work 
among the alien inhabitants. Centres opened in 
every public school in foreign colonies, where immi- 
grants might be taught, it is affirmed, would do more 
for foreigners in one year than ten years of legisla- 
tive inhibition as to what the foreigners should or 
should not do. By reason of the over-work of reg- 
ular teachers, and in many cases their ill-adaptation 
to the teaching of aliens, the public school as such is 
regarded as not the best agency through which the 
needed work can be accomplished. The opinion is 
expressed that the proper education of immigrants 
requires, in each city and town where they are 
resident in considerable numbers, a special superin- 
tendent, a special corps of teachers, and a special 
system. There can be no doubt of the general 
desirability of such an arrangement, or of its superior 
effectiveness. In few localities as yet, however, is 
the seriousness of the need appreciated to such a 
degree that the taxpayer is willing to meet it in the 
manner which Dr. Roberts would desire. 

The description of Austria-Hungary which is 
given by Rev. Francis E. Clark in " Old Homes of 
New Americans " is intended to acquaint the reader 
with the social and political conditions by which is 
determined the character of our Magyar, and of a 
considerable portion of our Slavic, Hebrew, and 
German immigration. The idea which underlies 
the book is that the proper place to begin the study 
of American race and industrial problems is in 
Europe, and especially that part of Europe which, 
while supplying an ever-increasing proportion of 
our alien influx, is still for the average American 
more or less a terra incognita. The point of view 
is unquestionably well taken, and it may be hoped 
that as time passes the immigrant problem will be 
attacked more and more at its sources. To the 
extent that the American people can be brought to 
an understanding of the inheritance of ideas and 
manners and the actual living conditions of our 
newcomers, the conditions of sympathy, forbearance, 
and good-will which are so essential to the amalga- 
mation of diverse population elements will be sup- 
plied. To this desirable end Dr. Clark's book, 
which has the merit of being based upon somewhat 
intensive personal observation, makes real contribu- 
tion. The scholar will find in the volume nothing 
that is new; indeed, he will find in it a good many 
statements which are open to question, and, in gen- 
eral, an inclination toward the picturesque which is 
not wholly consistent with soberness of judgment.

But the book is not intended for the scholar; and 
to the hurried reader who may wish to obtain at a 
couple of sittings a somewhat intimate and suffi- 
ciently discriminating impression of the antecedents 
of the Magyar or Slovak who crowds him on the 
street or lives around the next corner, the volume 
may be commended without reserve. Its lightness

RECENT POETRY.* 

For the second time this year, the verse of our 
foremost living poet, Mr. George Edward Wood- 
berry, occupies its rightful place at the head of our 
survey of recent books of poetry. Like the volume 
we reviewed a few months ago, the present collec- 
tion, published by the Woodberry Society, contains 
but three poems, and is supplied with a preface 
which takes us jnto the writer's intimate confidence. 
They are all, he tells us, "poems of expectancy, in 
the mood of faith in the unimagined future. They 
have a touch of prophetic conviction, and that 
atmosphere of largeness of world-hope which is a 
trait of our time." The first of the three is called 
"The Kingdom of All-Souls." It is written in a 
somewhat irregular verse, approaching the iambic 
heptameter as its norm, but making a large use of 
anapaests, and frequently using internal rhymes. 
These are the opening lines : 

" I heard in my youth of a Kingdom, lying far at the whole 

world's end, 
And pilgrim-wise I clothed myself in my boyhood there to 

wend; 

Through the beautiful, the dutiful, the holy highway ran, 
So was I told, and it stretched through the midst of all 

the glory of man ; 
And all men spoke of the Kingdom, when they looked on 

my face of joy, 
And the souls of the dead spun the golden thread in the 

heart of the silent boy."

The suggestions for this poem came from an expe- 
rience in a Sicilian sulphur mine and a visit to the 
Greek state prison at Nauplia, where "the convicts 
fabricate an iron stamp, which is used to imprint 
the Christian symbol IHS on the Easter bread." 
These are the lines which embody the second expe- 
rience : 

" For I saw in the den of a prison-pen, on a peak of Argo's 

coast, 
Men whom whips compel, mould as in hell the matrix of 

the Host : 

Murderers, thieves, and every brood of dark and heinous sin 
Forged in that shed the seal of God's Bread, that stamps 

Christ's name therein." 

The second poem, "What the Stars Sang in the 
Desert," "records the memory of a night which I 
and my guides, having lost our way, spent in the 
desert between Biskra and Tongourt." This is the 
strain of the song : 

" We gaze on the far flood flowing 

Unimaginably free, 
Multitudinous, mystical, glowing, 
But all we do not see : 

And a rapture is all our knowing, 
That on fiery nerves comes stealing, 
An intimate revealing 
That all is yet to be. 

" When sheathed and glacial o'er us 

Arcturus courses cold, 
And dry and dark before us 
Aldebaran is rolled, 

Far-clustering orbs in chorus 
Shall light the pealing sky 
And throne to throne reply, 
' The heavens grow not old.' v 

Mr. Woodberry's third poem is, as the title indicates, 
a Nietzschean suggestion, being called "Beyond 
Good and Evil." The author admits the spell of 
Nietzsche, but disavows the doctrine. "I know no 
modern thinker with such a fire-flow in him, the 
vital burst, la vie. I think of him as what I have 
found most rare in life, either among men or books, 
a companion on my way. I dare say I should 
have found him, in real life, quite impossible ; but, 
safely walled apart by time and space and death, 
we are friends in the spirit." The poem pictures 
a ride "in the dark of the spirit." 

" We were past the good and the evil, 

In the spirit's uttermost dark ; 
He is neither god nor devil 

For whom my heart-beats hark ; 
And I leaned my cheek to my horse's neck, 

And I sang to his ear in the dark : 
' There is neither good nor evil, 
There is neither god nor devil, 

And our way lies on through the dark.' " 

Poems about books are apt to be anaemic, and 
one can hardly soar to heights of lyric rapture over 
a first edition, but the book-lover has feelings that 
prose is not exalted enough to express, and is at 
times constrained to pour them forth in verse. Mr. 
Clinton Scollard's "Lyrics from a Library" sing to 
us of Keats and Herrick, of Theocritus and Omar, 
of 'Lanier and Freneau, of Caxton, Walton, and

many others, all with delicate appreciation and 
charmingly subtle fancy. He knows the joy of 
first editions, but there is a sting in his discourse 
concerning them.

Who seek our constant company ; 
Unless yonr purses, plethoric, hold 
The round and clearly-minted gold, 
Abjure us, shun us, lest the night 
Creep on ye, and pale candle-light 
Find ye by us uncomforted, 
And slipping supperless to bed." 

"A Bookworm's Plaint" is an admirable specimen 
of familiar verse. 

" To-day, when I had dined my fill 
Upon a Caxton, you know Will, 
I crawled forth o'er the colophon 
To bask awhile within the sun ; 
And having coiled my sated length, 
I felt anon my whilom, strength 
Slip from me gradually, till deep 
I dropped away in dreamful sleep, 
Wherein I walked an endless maze, 
And dined on Cartons all my days. 

" Then I woke suddenly. Alas ! 
What in my sleep had come to pass ? 
That priceless first edition row, 
Squat, quarto, and tall folio, 
Had, in my slumber, vanished quite ; 
Instead, on my astonished sight 
The^newest novels burst, a gay 
And most unpalatable array ! 
I, that have battened on the best, 
Why should I thus be dispossessed, 
And with starvation, or the worst 
Of diets, cruelly be curst ? " 

In more serious vein is this fine sonnet-tribute to 
Philip Freneau: 

" Now that the vesper-planet's violet glow 
la smothered in a welter of gray cloud, 
And all the winds that sweep the sky are loud, 
I mind me how, one white night long ago, 
Our earliest poet, valiant-souled Freneau, 

By the stern stress of years assailed and bowed, 
Fell by the way, and found a fatal shroud 
In the benumbing silence of the snow ! 

" When the young nation shook with war's grim throes, 
The smiting of his song was as a sword, 
The light of it was as a beacon flame ; 
And though the drift of Time's unpitying snows 
Upon the mound that hides his dust be poured, 
It may not dim the glory of his name." 

We must also quote the envoy of the collection: 

" The varied Book of Life, 
How hurriedly we con ! 

Through the pages sown with grief and strife 
We reach the colophon. 

" We would peruse it still 

Despite its stress, but nay, 
It must be closed, saith the Great Will, 
And laid aside for aye." 

Lyrics of love, nature, and the religious mood 
make up the contents of Miss Grace Duffield Good- 
win's "Horizon Songs." Without originality or 
marked distinction, they are nevertheless pleasing 



by virtue of their delicate imagery and tender wist- 
ful sentiment. "Confidence" is a fair example: 

" I know not where the Blessed wait, 
Within what glory-girdled lands, 
Nor on what hill of God, elate, 
Redemption's city stands. 

" Mine eyes are blind because of tears, 

My feet move slow on Sorrow's ways, 
And loneliness of earthly years 
Bedims the heavenly days. 

" Yet even when nearest to despair, 

(God give me grace to suffer then), 
I know, I know, sometime, somewhere, 
We find our own again." 

Miss Amy Lowell, in " A Dome of Many-Col- 
oured Glass," hardly lives up to her own definition 
of poetry. 

" What is poetry ? Is it a mosaic 

Of coloured stones which curiously are wrought 
Into a pattern ? Bather glass that 's taught 
By patient labor any hue to take 
And glowing with a sumptuous splendor, make 
Beauty a thing of awe ; where sunbeams caught, 
Transmuted fall in sheafs of rainbows fraught 
With storied meaning for religion's sake." 

Instead of the flights and imaginings suggested 
by these verses, Miss Lowell gives us precise and 
pretty fancies inspired by nature and by art 
verses upon the seasons and the stars, upon Japan- 
ese prints and Italian paintings, upon authors and 
their books. She imparts to us naive confidences, 
as when she says : 

" I love the vivid life of winter months 
In constant intercourse with human minds, 
When every new experience is gain 
And on all sides we feel the great world's heart ; 
The pulse and throb of life which makes us new," 

or when she sings. of her fruit garden: 

" Dear garden of my childhood, here my years 
Have run away like little grains of sand ; 

The moments of my life, its hopes and fears 
Have all found utterance here, where now I stand ; 

My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears, 
You are my home, do you not understand." 

It is neatly put, but not very important. Miss 
Lowell's most pretentious poem is dedicated to 
"The Boston Athenaeum," where 

" We feel that we are not alone, 
We too are one with our own richest past ; 
And here that veiled, but ever smouldering fire 
Of race, which rarely seen yet never dies, 
Springs up afresh and warms us with its heat." 

"Myself and I," by Miss Fannie Stearns Davis, 
is a volume of "magazine verse." This opinion 
does not need for its confirmation the prefatory note 
of acknowledgment to a list of popular periodicals 
for permission to reprint. Its contents are too evi- 
dently the futile flutterings that editors use to fill in 
the chinks. 

" I do not know why they should heed my singing." 
Nor do we. 

" Are they not deaf and blind with urgent Life ? 
And what am I, save one small lark, down-flinging 
My sun-song on a battle's blood-red strife ? "

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



Most of these poems are na'ive confidences, such as 
"The Dead Folk," of which we quote the ending. 

" My body is a curious thing. 

My soul 's not half so strange, 
Who may go forth on gleaming wing, 
And take no touch of change. 

" But that my body should lie still, 

And never dance or run, 
And never climb a crooked hill, 
And never see the sun, 

" This is a strange, strange thing to me ; 

And stranger yet it grows 
Each time I stop awhile to see 
The Dead Folk's decent rows." 

"A Walled Garden and Other Poems," by Miss 
Margaret Root Garvin, is another collection of 
magazine verse. "Moon Flowers," a pretty conceit, 
may be taken to illustrate the quality of this vol- 
ume: 

"Flowers of the Moon, are dreams: 

Sudden they spring from the dark soil of night ; 
In shadows foliate, their buds are bright ; 

With bloom, more fair than fruit, their leafage teems, 
Flowers of the Moon. 

" Like night-moths, Psyche-winged, 

Our soul do sip these flower-founts of Joy ; 
Until the flames of Dawn the wings destroy, 

And tendrils break, that round our hearts were ringed, 
Flowers of the Moon ! " 

The note of mysticism is predominant in Miss 
Evelyn Underbill's "Immanence," as might be 
expected by anyone acquainted with the author's 
philosophical and imaginative work in prose. The 
last poem of the volume seems to us the most quot- 
able for the purpose of adequate representation. It 
is entitled "Transcendence." 

" Within thy sheltering darkness spin the spheres ; 
Within the shaded hollow of thy wings. 
The life of things, 

The changeless pivot of the passing years 
These in thy bosom be. 
Restless we seek thy being; to and fro 
Upon our little twisting earth we go : 
We cry, ' Lo, there ! ' 

When some new avatar thy glory does declare, 
When some new prophet of thy friendship sings, 
And in his tracks we run 
Like an enchanted child, that hastes to catch the sun. 

' And shall the soul thereby 
Unto the All draw nigh ? 
Shall it avail to plumb the mystic deeps 
Of flowery beauty, scale the icy steeps 
Of perilous thought, thy hidden Face to find, 
Or tread the starry paths to the utmost verge of the sky? 
Nay, groping dull and blind 
Within the sheltering dimness of thy wings 
Shade that their splendour flings 
Athwart Eternity 

We, out of age-long wandering, but come 
Back to our Father's heart, where now we are at home." 

Such poetry, appealing as it is, seems to do little 
more than chase the will-o'-the-wisps of fancy, and 
drug the spirit in its irrational moods, drifting 
blindly, with no firm anchorage of thought. It does 
not give us clean-cut ideas, and its logic is purely 
emotional. 



Miss Eva Gore-Booth's "The Agate Lamp" 
opens with a series of brief interpretations of works 
of painting and sculpture, such as these lines upon 
"The Dawn" of Michelangelo: 

" Not as Aurora of the smiling eyes 
And rosy fingers doth this dawn awake ; 
Neither, like Aphrodite, doth she rise 
From the bright waves, all silver for her sake. 
Rather is she the Image in the Soul, 
The beautiful young dawn of all things fair, 
Who wakes in a dark world of gloom and dole, 
Wrapped in the marble coldness of despair. 
Thou sorrowful Dawn invincible, alone, 
Pale sleeper, from thy long rest turn aside ; 
Four hundred years of slumber hast thou known; 
Long broken is that Florentine's fierce pride 
That held thee tranced through years of storm and stress ; 
O, buried in the marble calm and cold, 
Wake thou, the world is full of heaviness, 
And men have need of beauty, as of old." 

" Divina Commedia " is the title of a wonderful 
long poem in which the vision of the modern world 
is contrasted with that revealed to the Tuscan poet. 

" And Beatrice vanished is the shining sphere 
And saints' high throne above the world apart, 
Yet with us dwells the dream divine and dear 
That folds in beauty every living heart. 

" No heaven is ours of lights and whirling flame 
For dying warriors a starlit goal 
But a lost country called -by a new name, 
Deep buried in dim valleys of the soul. 

" A gentle land where the white singing waves 
Move softly under silver twilight skies, 
And life with her fierce wars and dreadful graves 
Seems but a little wind that falling sighs. 

" The poet's laurel and the martyr's palm 
Wither, the old enchantments fade and cease ; 
Yet still the vision of the ancient calm 
Folds, round this weary world, wide wings of peace. 

These are but a few stanzas of a poem whose grave 
and measured beauty long haunts the mind. 

Mr. Watson's new volume is entitled " The Muse 
in Exile," which seems to mean that its contents 
have been largely occasioned by the journeyings of 
recent years to America and elsewhere. To empha- 
size this character of the volume, it is prefaced by 
the lecture on "The Poet's Place in the Scheme of 
Life," which the author delivered upon several occa- 
sions during his last American visit. Here is an 
impression de voyage, which is also a graceful 
tribute to his American friends. 

" How can we think 
Coldly of such a land, itself so warm 
In its accost and greeting ? There we win 
Friends whom to lose were to find life itself 
Less winsome. There, too, did we taste awhile 
Sorrow, not pleasure alone. And there we roamed 
Wide as from Spain-remembering shores, that watch 
The hues and moods of a chameleon sea 
Beyond Miami's palms and olive-groves 
To where Niagara takes the infernal plunge, 
And out of the grey rage of the abysm, 
Out of the torment, everlastingly, 
Upbreathes what seems, when sunlight touches it, 
The smoke of Hell, lost in the smile of God."

THE DIAL

The volume includes several tributes to the poet's 
charming Irish wife, of which " Part of My Story " 
is perhaps the tenderest. 

" We met when you were in the May of life, 

And I had left its June behind me far. 
Some barren victories, much defeat and strife, 
Had marked my soul with many a hidden scar. 

" I was a man deep hurt with blows that men 

Ne'er guessed at; strangely weak more strangely 

strong ; 

Daring at times ; and uttering now and then, 
Out of a turbid heart, a limpid song. 

" Fitful in effort, fixed and clear in aim ; 

Poor, but not envious of the wealth I lack ; 
Ever half-scaling the hard hill of fame, 
And ever by some evil fate flung back, 

" Such did you find me, in that city grey 

Where we were plighted, O my comrade true : 
My wife, now dearer far than on the day 
When this our love was new." 

Something of the old fire burns in Mr. Watson's 
verse when he hails the overthrow of the Turk, or 
expresses his indignation at the willingness of an 
English government to cast loyal, proud, "great- 
hearted Ulster" as a sop to the lions, or praises the 
plea of an American poet for the preservation of 
his country's honor by keeping her pledged faith 
with England in the Panama matter. On all these 
themes, his song rings true, although his voice be- 
comes a sort of falsetto when it says "Thou art 
America, dauntless Theodore." The sonnet which 
has this ending leaves a bad taste in the mouth. 
Mr. Watson's volume, as a whole, contributes 
considerably to our pleasure, although it contains 
nothing comparable to the noble pieces upon which 
his reputation is so firmly based. We feel it to be 
the work of a man who realizes the high seriousness 
of the poet's calling, and is in no danger of being 
lured away from his exalted mission by the verbal 
tricksters of the hour who impudently masquerade 
in the muse's garments. 

The muse in exile is again illustrated by Mr. 
Arthur Shearly Cripps, an Oxford man devoting 
his life to missionary work in South Africa. There 
are recompenses for the exile in the strange new 
forms of beauty that unfold themselves to his vision, 
and in the broadening of his sympathies that came 
from loving interest in alien peoples. All this is 
expressed in the ballade of " Pan's Country," which 
is another name for Mashonaland. 

" Did Athens' Queen, the violet-crown'd, 

Athene's lore to alceris preach ? 
Did a dark galley southward-bound 

Ship Sophists for some Dorian beach ? 
Did one the springs of Zaden reach, 

And one Cyllene's rock-shale spurn ? 
Be sure, Pan said his say to each 

They came to teach, they stayed to learn! 

" We that have fled green English ground 

For sun-tanned hills and moors that bleach 
More than red rubies' worth have found 
In these thatched porches where we teach. 



The stoic herdsmen we beseech 

From food's and raiment's lust to turn 

Doth not their faith our faith impeach? 
We came to teach, we stay to learn. 

" We teach of Arms that wrap us round 

Safe from wolf's howl and night-bird's screech, 
Of Blood, whose balm from Fivefold Wound 

Outvies all salves of earthly leech 
For dying hearts' despair and breach. 

How bright our faith's dull embers burn 
In plowman's psalm and goatherd's speech ! 

We came to teach, we stay to learn. 

" Oxford, thy deep-voiced chimes renowned, 

For which our ears hark back and yearn, 
As sheep-bells here to shepherds sound 

Where shepherds teach, where shepherds learn." 

A dream world of elusive shapes and tremulous 
imaginings is half revealed to our vision by the 
subdued lyrics which Mr. Robert Frost entitles "A 
Boy's Will." It is a world in which passion has 
been stilled and the soul grown quiet a world not 
explored with curious interest, but apprehended by 
the passive recipient. The sun does not shine, but 
the pale grey of twilight enfolds nature with a 
more gracious charm. The song called "Flower- 
Gathering " offers an exquisite example of the wist- 
ful and appealing quality of the author's strain. 

" I left you in the morning, 
And in the morning glow, 
You walked away beside me 
To make me sad to go. 
Do you know me in the gloaming, 
Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming ? 
Are you dumb because you know me not, 
Or dumb because you know ? 

" All for me ? And not a question 
For the faded flowers gay 
That could take me from beside you 
For the ages of a day ? 
They are yours, and be the measure 
Of their worth for you to treasure, 
The measure of the little while 
That I Ve been long away." 

The desire of the solitary soul for companionship 
has rarely found such beautiful expression as it 
receives in this quotation: 

" We make ourselves a place apart 

Behind light words that tease and flout, 
But oh, the agitated heart 

Till someone find us really out." 

"Reluctance" is the poem that closes the collection 
a lyric of lassitude with just a faint flicker of 
the spent fire of life. 

" But through the fields and the woods 
And over the walls I have wended ; 

I have climbed the hills of view 

And looked at the world, and descended ; 

I have come by the highway home, 
And lo, it is ended. 

" The leaves are all dead on the ground, 
Save those that the oak is keeping 

To ravel them one by one 

And let them go scraping and creeping 

Out over the crusted snow, 
When others are sleeping.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



" And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, 
No longer blown hither and thither ; 

The last lone aster is gone, 

The flowers of the witch-hazel wither 

The heart is still aching to seek, 
But the feet question ' Whither ? ' 

" Ah, when to the heart of a man 

Was it ever less than a treason 
To go with the drift of things 

To yield with a grace to reason, 
And bow and accept the end 

Of a love or a season ? " 

If Mr. Frost's verses show the cast of melancholy, 
there is at least nothing morbid about it. In their 
simple phrasing and patent sincerity, his songs give 
us the sort of pleasure that we have in those of the 
"Shropshire Lad" of Mr. Housman. 

The following elegy on Tolstoi well illustrates 
the serene dignity which is perhaps the chief char- 
acteristic of Mr. John Drinkwater's " Poems of 
Love and Earth ": 

" Not ont of his due time he moves among 

The immemorial silences of death, 
The golden ears were full, the song was sung, 
And the prophetic breath 

" Had prophesied unto a world not wise 

Through a full tale of changing fiery days, 
And vision was no longer to his eyes 
Of earth's tumultuous ways. 

"His heart had striven long, his feet had pressed 

Adown the paths where many sorrows meet, 
Till the great heart was troubled in its quest, 
And tired the travelling feet. 

" His lips have spoken, and his lips are sealed, 
But we shall pluck the fruits of his desire 
In days to be when broken love is healed, 
And hearts are forged in fire." 

Mr. Drinkwater's verse has the strength that 
comes from severe restraint and the beauty that is 
revealed to the vision that pierces to the heart of 
life. Here is the last of his exquisite series of 
"Roundels of the Year": 

" The year is lapsing into time 
Along a deep and songless gloom, 
Unchapleted of leaf or bloom. 

" And mute between the dusk and prime 
The diligent earth re-sets her loom, 
The year is lapsing into time 
Along a deep and songless gloom. 

" While o'er the snows the seasons chime 
Their golden hopes to re-illume 
The brief eclipse about the tomb, 
The year is lapsing into time 
Along a deep and songless gloom, 
Unchapleted of leaf or bloom." 

This is a very slender volume, but its pages reveal 
an unmistakable individuality, and upon every one 
of them is the mark of distinction. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Oermanv from " Criticism," writes Mr. Price Collier, 
an American "is temptingly easy when it consists, 
point of view. as ft so o f t en does, in merely noting 
what is different, or what is not there. Helpful 
criticism I take to be the discovery of what is there, 
and its revelation, with an examination of its history, 
its truth, and its value." In his collection of essays 
on " England and the English," published a few 
years ago, Mr. Collier showed that he is a very fair 
master of the art of helpful criticism; and fresh 
evidence of the fact is supplied by his recently- 
published companion volume, "Germany and the 
Germans " (Scribner). The Germans are discussed, 
as were the English, from an avowedly American 
point of view, and the principal value of the one piece 
of work as of the other must arise from its tendency 
to promote that mutual knowledge of environments, 
traditions, and ideas upon which the concord of the 
great nations of the world must eventually be based. 
The volume opens with two chapters, aggregating a 
hundred pages (a sixth of the book), undertaking to 
sketch the salient facts of German history from the 
Cimbri and Teutones to Bismarck and William II. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Collier is no historian. Not only 
does he fail to present his material in this portion of 
his book in concise and orderly manner, but he is by 
no means always accurate in his statements of fact. 
Tacitus did not write with " Rooseveltian enthu- 
siasm" (p. 8) concerning the rearing of children 
among the Germans. The assertion that " more 
than any other one factor, the crusades broke up 
feudalism " (p. 22) is at best but a half-truth. 
Charlemagne did not sweep "all Europe under his 
sway " (p. 26) ; not the whole of Spain, but a very 
small portion of it, was " under his kingship " (p. 26). 
The University of Bologna was from the beginning 
a centre for the study of law, rather than medicine 
and philosophy (p. 33). Such erroneous or ques- 
tionable statements as these, together with other 
occasional lapses or sudden transitions of thought, 
impair seriously the value of the two chapters under 
consideration ; and the reader is further exasperated 
by faulty punctuation and careless proof-reading. In 
truth the book would have been a better one if these 
chapters had been omitted altogether. When, how- 
ever, the author comes to the purely descriptive por- 
tion of his work he arrives upon surer ground. He 
has no vantage point of special intimacy from which 
to write of the personality of the Kaiser, yet he 
manages to furnish a characterization of "the Indis- 
creet" which is informing and well in accord with 
the generally known facts. Berlin, as a capital and 
metropolis, is interestingly described; and there are 
readable chapters, characterized by a wholesome 
freshness of view, on the educational system and its 
connection with the progress of the country, the 
army, industry and its problems, the status of women, 
and the relations of the Empire with the outside 
world. The tone of the book is sympathetic, even

admiring; yet, on the whole, the conclusion is rather 
unfavorable, and the spirit and culture of the Ger- 
mans are pronounced artificial and unstable. 

Ibsen's Fydell Edmund Garrett, an English 

'and"vrical political journalist who died recently, 
poems. was one of the first of his country- 

men to discover Ibsen, and he discovered him in the 
right way. While others were chattering about the 
social dramas, immersed in studies of their remark- 
able technique, or occupied with the discussion of 
their diagnosis of the ills of modern civilization, 
Garrett realized that the true manifestation of 
Ibsen's genius was to be found in " Brand," and 
" Peer Gynt," and the " Digte." The year 1894, 
in which Professor Herf ord published his wonderful 
translation of " Brand," was the year which found 
Garrett also engaged upon an English version of 
that great work. After completing this, he turned 
his attention to the " Digte," and translated nearly 
one-half of the entire number. All these transla- 
tions are now reissued under the supervision of his 
widow, in a volume entitled " Lyrics and Poems 
from Ibsen " (Button). The "Brand" is given in 
Garrett's final revision, and we have appended the 
scene of Aase's death from "Peer Gynt." The 
entire volume constitutes a noble tribute to Ibsen's 
genius, and will be a precious possession even to 
those who can read him in the original Norwegian. 
We have hitherto regarded Professor Herford's 
" Brand " as unapproachably successful, but we 
must admit that Garrett's version is almost equally 
deserving of praise. Here is a test passage for 
comparison. Herf ord gives us: 

" Not for us the Cross He mounted ! 

Just the stirrup-slash's stain 

Just the gash the cobbler scored 

In the shoulder of the Lord, 

Is our portion of this Pain." 

In Garrett, this becomes : 

" Not for us the cross was taken ; 
No ! The cobbler's stirrup-blow 
Which but left one purple track 
On the doomed Redeemer's back, 
Is our fraction of His passion ! 
All the rest we can forego ! " 

Fine as the latter version is, the former is still finer 
and happier. This, however, is not always to be 
said, and we think that Garrett is the more successful 
with the crucial lines that end the fourth act. 
" Soul, be steadfast to the last ! 

Till the fight of fights is o'er ! 

When thine All away is cast, 

Loss is gain for evermore." 

This is truer to the original, and more inspiring to 
the shaken soul, than Herford's 

" Soul, be patient in thy pain ! 

Triumph in its bitter cost. 

All to lose was all to gain ; 

Nought abideth but the Lost." 

Mr. P. H. Wicksteed,- who writes an introduction 
to the " Digte," and supplies the translations with 
helpful explanatory notes, gives us some words of 
searching criticism, of which the following may be 



taken for an example : " But yet, for all his sense 
of the worth of life, that ' fight with trolls ' of 
which he was so deeply conscious indicates some 
exceptional feeling in Ibsen's soul of a hostile power 
which cramped and conditioned his self-expression ; 
and his most fervent admirers must often feel that 
he was a haunted man, that he was in some sense 
possessed, that he had paid a terrible price for his 
insight and his achievement, and that though he was 
always seeking to break through to the light, he was 
often beset by a doubt whether darkness might not 
after all be the natural abode of man." The poem 
which Garrett calls " The Daylight Coward " affords 
an illustration of this comment. Garrett is by no 
means the only translator of Ibsen's lyrics. Gosse, 
Boyesen, Payne, and others have done fragmentary 
work in this field, and Mr. Percy Shedd has done 
almost as much as Garrett. We are especially 
thankful to Garrett for his versions of " Paa Vid- 
derne " and '' Terje Vigen," and for the group of 
national songs occasioned by the hour of Denmark's 
Gethsemane, when Norway stood aloof while the 
sister nation was being despoiled by the conqueror. 
Perhaps more than for anything else we should be 
grateful for Garrett's translation of the intolerably 
poignant scene of Aase's death. This preserves the 
lyrical swing, the " quick broken dialogue" and the 
"racy naturalness "of the original. "To Soria-Moria 
Castle " the translation is called, and it was first 
published in 1904 in the " Independent Review." 

Fifty inness ^ r * D a i n g el> fi e kl has followed his 
paintings in study of the life and art of George 
reproduction. i nness w jth a most valuable supple- 
ment. In a collection called "Fifty Paintings by 
George Inness" (New York: F. F. Sherman), he 
presents more pictures by the artist than anyone 
before has been able to see together, except in the 
exhibition held after Inness's death. The general 
impression (as of that exhibition) is very fine. 
Reproductions can never give us what the pictures 
do ; but what can be done by reproduction is here 
done for the student of Inness. Here he has the 
most important works of the painter, with note of 
size, date, and present place of the picture, and some 
introductory comment. Here will be found not only 
the better known examples from the larger collec- 
tions, such as the Butler Collection at the Chicago 
Art Institute or the Evans Collection at the National 
Gallery in Washington, but also a number of less- 
known or generally unknown pictures from private 
collections. With such a set of photographs the 
student can follow for himself the development of 
the ideas of the painter, and of the technique can 
get a notion at least of the composition and general 
handling. There has not yet been made a thorough 
study of the work of George Inness. Mr. Dainger- 
field holds that no such study can be successful un- 
less a man will found himself upon Inness's religious 
convictions and work up from that basis. He him- 
self in his Introduction points out that the earlier 
pictures are full of detail, while in the later " the

fabric, the substructure," is kept out of sight though 
not less present. Here he is doubtless quite correct, 
but we wish very much that he had gone farther in 
the direction he has indicated. It would seem as if 
one so familiar with the artist's ideas and his paint- 
ings might have sought to show us definitely how 
the later works are expressive of religious conviction, 
to indicate what the quality is that takes the place 
of the careful detail, to show how the spiritual sense 
dominates the substructure of fact. This, perhaps, 
is too much to expect in a short Introduction. We 
do not see, however, that Mr. Daingerfield does 
what might be done in the way of definite study ; he 
appears to us to be far too fond of such critical 
remarks as " Color is the music of George Inness's 
painting." But it will perhaps be to the advantage 
of the student that he should not be entirely satisfied 
with the Introduction, he will be led to rely more 
upon the pictures themselves. And certainly in this 
respect the book is adequate ; there are few Amer- 
ican painters whose work has been better presented 
than is that of George Inness in this volume. 

Thepertisand To readers and writers, as well as 
pleasure* of to publishers, Mr. Robert Sterling 
book-publishing. Yard's little book, "The Publisher" 
(Houghton), with its inside information on the mys- 
teries of a great and honored calling, will prove of 
very real interest. Its four chapters treat of " the 
worst business in the world," as some, not including 
Mr. Yard, might call the publisher's mode of making 
a living ; of what makes a book sell ; of that modern 
method of book-selling which the writer calls " a 
dollar down and a dollar a minute"; and, finally, 
of the publisher, the author, and the devil, the 
literary agent being meant by the last designation. 
Mr. Yard's experience in journalism and in book- 
publishing, as well as his present position as editor 
of a leading magazine, qualifies him to speak with 
first-hand knowledge of many things that take place 
in the world of printer's ink, and he writes in a 
brisk and breezy style that carries the reader un- 
wearied to the end of his little book and leaves him 
rather regretful that it is not a bigger book. Its 
manner is not too technical for popular enjoyment, 
and many of the fundamental principles it touches 
on are principles that apply in more trades than one. 
Concerning the perennially important problem of 
advertising, the author says, inter alia, that the book- 
buying public " is itself the eager seeker for the new 
and the worth while between book covers. And it 
will naturally seek its information where information 
can be found most easily and cheaply, namely, in the 
advertising pages of those periodicals habitually used 
by the largest number of publishers. There are not 
many of these periodicals, and it is obvious that the 
publisher who seeks this useful public need go little 
further with his advertising." Book-publishing is 
"essentially a one-man business," he insists, "though 
the wise publisher surrounds himself with strong, 
sympathetic advisers." On the whole, Mr. Yard 
shows in a very attractive light the business that, 



as far as large and sure profits are concerned, might 
not unreasonably be considered the worst business 
in the world, but that is the only business in the 
world to the born publisher ; for publishers, like 
poets, are born, not made. The book closes with a 
certain prominent publisher's assertion that " pub- 
lishing is neither a business nor a profession. It 
is a career." 

Jefferson's After a half century of Hamilton- 

services to ianisni, it is interesting to see the 

the Republic. balance turn and Jefferson come into 
his own again. A sign of the times is found in 
the lectures delivered at Columbia University on 
the George Blumenthal Foundation by the Hon. 
John Sharp Williams, United States Senator from 
Mississippi, now published in a volume entitled 
"Thomas Jefferson: His Permanent Influence on 
American Institutions " ( Columbia University Press) . 
Rather hastily assembled and popularly written, 
these lectures are seven in number, and treat re- 
spectively of Jefferson as revolutionist, democratizer 
of state institutions, diplomat, democratizer of 
federal institutions, and president, and of his influ- 
ence upon freedom of religion in America and upon 
our educational institutions. Jefferson has not been 
entirely fortunate in his biographers, many of his 
points of view being so at odds with those of Europe 
that their effect has been distorted or minimized; 
but with Senator Williams his radical belief in 
democracy finds a sympathy rather whole-hearted 
than discriminating. Yet, there being no one more 
unfortunate than the personage with whom his biog- 
rapher is not in sympathy (unless it be a fictional 
character under similar circumstances), it is most 
agreeable to find accord so complete as in the 
present case, if only as a corrective to the too dis- 
criminating estimates heretofore current. Senator 
Williams does not say, what the writer of this 
review believes he might truthfully have said, that 
American, as distinguished from European, ideas 
in our governments, state and federal, find their 
chief source in Jefferson, the opposingor Hamiltonian 
school grounding itself solely upon the aristocratic 
methods of older lands. He does make clear, 
however, that these ideas arose among English and 
Scotch philosophical historians, and were adapted 
by the genius of Jefferson to our needs, and that 
Jefferson's influence upon the French Revolution 
was much greater than the influence over him of 
either the revolutionaries or their predecessors, the 
encyclopaedists. Another interesting paper might 
have been written, in the nature of a synopsis of 
the others, on Jefferson's political philosophy, upon 
which the modern school of individualism is based, 
and certainly more might have been said about the 
little comprehended fact that the Jeffersonian influ- 
ence in our government is the conservative influence, 
all the radical and Europeanizing measures which 
we have made ours having their origins in one or 
another of the political parties which that founded 
by Jefferson has seen rise, grow moribund, and die,

largely through adventitious opportunism, lack of 
idealism, and neglect of principle. To those wishing 
to form an estimate of Jefferson's services to the 
Republic which will serve as an antidote to the poi- 
son once written about him by Mr. Roosevelt (though 
Mr. Roosevelt's new party announces itself as based 
upon Jeffersonian ideals), Senator Williams's uni- 
formly interesting lectures can be freely commended. 

Under the ambitious title, " Women 

Studies of ... ,.' . ,, , 

Feminism as World Builders : Studies in Mod- 

in action. ern Feminism" (Forbes), Mr. Floyd 

Dell has considered the feminist movement in a 
manner and from a standpoint new to American 
discussion. His book is in direct line of descent 
from the once potent English pamphlet, written 
briefly, impressionistically, and with a good deal 
of that cleverness which made the pamphlet such a 
power in the days of its prime as an instrument of 
propaganda. Mr. Dell's standpoint is new in that 
he eschews theory, after his introductory chapter, 
and discusses the actual contributions of living 
women to the new world synthesis in which self- 
conscious womanhood is beginning to play so im- 
portant a part. At first sight the author's grouping 
of his subjects will appear rather incongruous. For 
the most part he pairs them off, Miss Addams and 
Mrs. Pankhurst in one chapter, Olive Schreiner 
and Isadora Duncan in another, and so forth. But 
he succeeds in justifying these curious pairings. 
The pacific temper of Miss Addams is well con- 
trasted with the militant temper of Mrs. Pankhurst 
although with Mr. Dell's dictum that Miss Addams's 
temper of conciliation is not a feminine but a mas- 
culine trait, and that, therefore, Mrs. Pankhurst is 
more truly representative of feminine aspiration and 
method of attainment, not all of us will agree. The 
justification for pairing Olive Schreiner and Isadora 
Duncan lies in the fact that although they are super- 
ficially far apart, they are akin in this, that each 
has shown a new avenue to woman's freedom, one 
through the channel of industrial activity, the other 
through the channel of artistic activity, emanci- 
pating, one the hand from idleness, and the other 
the body from Puritan bans upon its play activities. 
From women as a working section of the world, and 
apart from these other avenues of freedom which he 
describes them as opening up, Mr. Dell expects a 
greater radicalism than from men, and a greater 
readiness to tear down our present social structures 
wherever they are found to obstruct the building of 
the new society of the future. 

Notebook, of Two considerations make "The Note- 
the author of Books of Samuel Butler," as edited 
"Erewhon." ty ]yj r> Henry Festing Jones, of 
exceptional interest. First, the volume is a docu- 
ment of a little-known writer, one who failed of 
the ordinary literary success of getting his books 
published at some one else's expense, and of getting 
them read by the multitude. This is something 
a priori in its favor. Some readers find the minor 



poets the truest poets, and obscure writers the most 
suggestive. A reading of Butler's notes will open 
one's eyes to the filmy veil between popularity 
and unpopularity, between obscure and luminous. 
Butler's own explanation of his failure to secure a 
hearing, that he had played the enfant terrible, 
scattering bombs among the "big wigs" of both 
science and religion, is probably correct in part. 
Other reasons appear in the Notes: it is evident 
that he was somewhat vain, jealous, and (what is 
perhaps more dangerous to a literary reputation) 
overfond of a thin fancy and humorous "small 
beer." Nevertheless he has recorded here many 
wise and witty things, most of them well worthy of 
the " big wigs " he so delighted to satirize. The 
other consideration is that these are extracts from 
note-books, the most intimate, piquant, first-hand 
revelations of a man's mind. Butler's reason for 
keeping such full notes is delightfully put: "One's 
thoughts fly so fast that one must shoot them; it is 
no use trying to put salt on their tails." The bril- 
liant, wavering half-thoughts, the twilight sugges- 
tions, if we could only get them down just as 
they are, even though we never get them properly 
stuffed and mounted, what a delight and enrich- 
ment of our personality they would be ! Note-Books 
such as Hawthorne's or Butler's are especially rich 
to the literary amateur or professional. In them 
is usually to be found the most life and the best 
style. In these of Butler's, moreover, we should 
say there is more truth than in his books, less 
posing and more condensation. This volume, com- 
ing at a time when more interest is being evinced 
in Butler than at any time previous (presaging his 
cherished "seventy years of immortality"), will do 
much to increase and justify perhaps regulate 
that interest. The book is published by Mr. 
Mitchell Kennerley, and contains an interesting 
portrait. 

Perhaps the most prophetic voice 

f the n6W a g e > the a g e that has 

turned from intellectualism, pessim- 
ism, and utilitarianism toward the gospel of the 
will, of effort for personality's sake and without 
dogmatic guarantee of ultimate victory for man, 
and the most vigorous exponent of its tendencies, 
is the Frenchman, M. Romain Rolland. From the 
standpoint of this gospel have all his later works 
been written. His biographical writings may be 
regarded as canonical books in a new and entirely 
human scripture. The way of life for it is that 
rather than a world view, M. Rolland being doc- 
trinally agnostic which he lays down in "Jean 
Christophe," he illustrates in these biographies. 
"The Life of Michael Angelo" (Dutton), as trans- 
lated by Mr. Frederic Lees, is the life not primarily 
of an artist but of a personality. And majestic 
indeed is the personality, a Hercules whose labors 
have been multiplied endlessly, who stands before 
us in these pages. The actual graphic and plastic 
work of Michael Angelo was so subordinated to 



216 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



the demands of his unscrupulous employers of the 
Vatican that he ultimately lost faith in much of it. 
Nearer to his heart came to be his quest of beauty 
through love a quest made in the purest spirit of 
Platonism and finding its best fruit in the religious 
Vittoria Colonna, the woman who " could understand 
this old child, alone and lost in the world, and bring 
to his bruised soul a little peace, a little confidence, 
a little reason, and the melancholy acceptance of life 
and death." But Vittoria died in 1547, and it was 
not until 1564 that Michael Angelo, after an ever 
more solitary and pain-racked life, at last, as he 
had long hoped to do, "left time behind him." As 
might be expected from the mode of his treatment, 
M. Holland draws heavily on the sonnets throughout 
the course of his book, and he gives in an appendix 
a comprehensive selection of the most personal and 
beautiful of these in the original Italian. The book 
is illustrated with reproductions of the best-known 
works of its subject. 

A di,a P pomtin So vital and interesting a figure was 
boot about William Ernest Henley, and so little 

W. E. Henley, concerning him has found its way 
into print, that one takes up with pleasurable expec- 
tation the little book by Mr. L. Cope Cornford, re- 
cently published by Houghton Mifflin Co. in their 
series of " Modern Biographies." But the work is 
almost a complete disappointment. It adds nothing 
to our knowledge of Henley as a man, and gives us 
no fresh or illuminating interpretation of his writ- 
ings. Of the author's crude and labored style, the 
following sentence is a not unfair example : " At any 
rate, when he arrived he was desperate; and when 
Lister asked him why he had come to him, Lister, 
Henley replied in plain terms that it was because 
the rest of the medical profession had declared that 
he, Professor Lister, was (in effect) totally incompe- 
tent." And here is one of the complete paragraphs : 
"In 1889, was born Henley's only child, Margaret. 
Her portrait was painted in oils by Charles Welling- 
ton Furse, A. R. A." The best thing about the book 
is the frontispiece portrait, depicting the lion-hearted 
poet in a particularly leonine pose. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In "The Philosophy of the Present in Germany" 
(Macmillan), Mr. and Mrs. G. T. W. Patrick offer a 
careful translation of Oswald Kiilpe's little discussion 
of naturalism, idealism, and realism in Germany. The 
work is popular, and useful as a survey of the philoso- 
phical situation in Germany ten years ago. 

The Oxford Book of Latin Verse " (Frowde), edited 
by Mr. H. W. Garrod, excludes epic and the drama and 
a large part of the Latin literature which is technically 
poetry but gives little or no aesthetic pleasure to its 
readers. Satire, also, is excluded, which leaves out 
Juvenal, Persius, and much of Horace. Otherwise, the 
selection includes a great variety of matter. A few 
" favorite " English translations and imitations are ap- 
pended. 



"The Great Lakes Series" (Ainsworth), a set of 
supplementary reading-books for elementary schools 
by Dr. Edward Payson Morton, recounts the story of 
American history as it was developed by the explora- 
tion and settlement of the great lakes. The series 
begins with " The Mohawk Valley and Lake Ontario " 
and " Lake Erie and the Story of Commodore Perry." 
The idea is an excellent one, and the material is of 
fascinating interest. 

" Italy To-day," by Messrs. Bolton King and Thomas 
Okey, which in the twelve years since its original pub- 
lication seems to have been accepted as probably the 
best accouut in English of current political and social 
questions in Italy, now reappears with the imprint of 
Messrs. Scribner in a " new and revised edition." Al- 
though the title-page bears date of 1913, we infer from 
a prefatory note that this is merely a reprint of the 
second English edition, with revisions down to 1909 
only. Thus the vitally important events and develop- 
ments of the past four years are left untouched. 

Following its handsome reprint of Bulwer-Lytton's 
letters to Macready, published a year or so ago, the 
Carteret Book Club of Newark, N. J., now puts forth 
two brochures, containing a brief essay entitled " Criti- 
cism " byWaltWhitman and an "Appreciation of Charles 
Dickens " by Charles Dudley Warner. It is believed 
that neither of these has ever before appeared in print. 
Fragmentary as they are, there is real pith and matter 
in both essays ; while the distinctive form in which they 
are issued, together with the fact that they are virtually 
first editions, will doubtless make them eagerly sought 
after by collectors. The edition is limited to one hundred 
copies in each case. 

The discussion occasioned by Mr. Morley Roberts's 
recent " revelations " of George Gissing's private life 
makes particularly timely the publication of a new edi- 
tion of Gissing's " Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft," 
which Messrs. Dutton now issue in a handsomely- 
printed octavo, with a fine reproduction of Mr. Will 
Rothenstein's lithographic portrait as frontispiece. 
Published originally ten years ago (soon after Gissing's 
death), this book has gone through many editions, and 
has found a wide circle of readers. It is a book unlike 
any other that we know of, a spiritual autobiography 
of the purest type, full of mellow thought finely ex- 
pressed and pervaded by a rare human charm. Those 
who would know what manner of man George Gissing 
was should read, not Mr. Roberts's injudicious and in- 
consequential volume, but " The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft." 

A volume that should be of value to high school 
teachers of literature has been prepared by Miss Sarah 
E. Simons and Mr. Clem Irwin Orr, of the Washington 
schools, under the title of " Dramatization " (Scott, 
Foresman & Co.). The aim is " to give practical sug- 
gestions for the dramatization of high school classics," 
not primarily as a means of entertainment, but as an aid 
to instruction. The pedagogy of dramatization is dis- 
cussed and the problem of staging carefully considered. 
Twenty or more scenes from novels, short stories, epics, 
and ballads are rewritten for stage presentation ; these 
are intended to be merely illustrative. The editors re- 
gard simplicity as the keynote to successful work in the 
high school. While some of their suggestions may be 
beyond the resources of the smaller school, the volume 
should be in many places practicable and in all sug- 
gestive.

NOTES. 



A critical study of Mr. Henry James is now in active 
preparation by the English critic, Mr. Ford Madox 
Hueffer. 

A new volume of plays by Mr. George Bernard Shaw, 
containing " Fanny's First Play " along with two others, 
will appear during the autumn. 

Two volumes by the Indian poet, Rabindranath 
Tagore, appear in the Macmillan Co.'s autumn list. 
One bears the title, " The Problem of Evil, and Other 
Lectures"; the other is a new collection of poems. 

Sir E. T. Cook, whose Life of Ruskin proved one of 
the most noteworthy biographies of recent years, is en- 
gaged upon a two-volume Life of Florence Nightingale, 
to be published in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

Miss Estelle Stead has recently completed a bio- 
graphy of her father, the late W. T. Stead, and the 
work is announced for autumn publication under the 
title, "My Father: Personal and Spiritual Reminis- 
cences." 

The Little Schools of Port-Royal," by Mr. H. C. 
Barnard, and " The Interregnum : Twelve Essays on 
Religion," by Dr. R. A. P. Hill, are soon to be published 
by Messrs. Putnam, in conjunction with the Cambridge 
University Press. 

Mrs. Mary Stewart Daggett, a Californian writer 
with several books already to her credit, has just placed 
with Browne & Howell Co. the manuscript of a little 
story entitled "The Yellow Angel," depicting the 
gradual Americanization of a Chinese cook. 

Mr. Eden Phillpotts has contradicted a suggestion 
that his forthcoming novel, " The Joy of Youth," con- 
tains an autobiographical element. He declares that 
this story of art and Italy is impersonal, as all his work 
is, and that his only concern is to create character. 

A collection of photogravure reproductions of " Fifty- 
eight Paintings by Homer Martin," with descriptive 
text by Mr. Dana H. Carroll, will be published during 
the Fall by Mr. Frederic F. Sherman in form similar 
to the Inness portfolio recently issued by this publisher. 
Professor Stephen Leacock, of McGill University, 
whose " Literary Lapses," " Nonsense Novels," and 
" Sunshine Sketches " have gained their author a high 
reputation as a humorist, has completed a new book 
which will be published by John Lane Co. under the 
title of " Behind the Beyond." 

The success of the Macmillan Co.'s "Standard 
Library " and " Modern Fiction Library " has led to the 
projection of a " Juvenile Library," in which will appear 
in the same general form and at the same low price 
new editions of the most successful books for young 
readers published by this house. 

Dr. F. S. Chapin, of Smith College, has written a book 
on " Social Evolution," which is intended to give the 
general reader an elementary survey of the facts and 
principles involved in the development of human nature 
out of the raw materials of lower forms of life. The 
book will be published by the Century Co. in the early 
autumn. 

The authorized biography of Henry Labouchere is to 
appear shortly. The work is in the hands of Mr. Algar 
Thorold, one of " Labby's " nephews, and will contain, 
amongst a large number of letters, an interesting cor- 
respondence between Labouchere and Mr. Joseph 
Chamberlain. Messrs. Putnam will publish the work 
in this country. 



A work dealing with the theory of natural selection, 
as expounded in the writings of Darwin and Wallace, 
has been written by the Rev. James Marchant, with the 
assistance of Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace. It examines 
the view held by modern men of science on the Darwin- 
Wallace theory as an explanation of the process of 
organic evolution. 

Mr. G. K. Chesterton has two new books in readiness 
for the autumn season. One of these, " The Flying 
Inn," is a partly farcical romance dealing with the ad- 
ventures of the last English inn-keeper at a date when 
Western Europe has been submerged by Islam and the 
doctrine of abstinence from potent drinks. The other 
is " The Evil of Eugenics," in which Mr. Chesterton 
attacks the eugenic theory most ferociously. 

A forthcoming series decidedly unhackneyed in plan 
is announced by Messrs. Dutton in "The Fellowship 
Books." The writers of the various volumes have been 
given free rein as to choice of subject, the only stipulation 
being that they must deal in a fresh and constructive 
way with the factors which enlarge and enrich life. The 
first volumes are as follows: "Friendship," by Mr. Clif- 
ford Bax; "The Joy of the Theatre," by Mr. Gilbert 
Cannan; "Divine Discontent," by Mr. James Guthrie; 
and " The Quest of the Ideal," by Miss Grace Rhys. 

" Man of letters, bibliographer, numismatist " thus 
runs the characterization in " Who's Who " of William 
Carew Hazlitt, who died on the 8th inst. A grandson of 
Hazlitt the great, he has himself established an honor- 
able name in the world of letters with a long list of 
original and edited works. He was born in London in 
1834, and though brought up to follow the profession of 
civil engineer, he turned at an early age to literature 
and archeology. His first book, " Memoirs of William 
Hazlitt," appeared in 1867. Among the more notable 
of his other writings are the following: " The Venetian 
Republic," "Four Generations of a Literary Family," 
" Leisure Intervals " (poems), " The Lambs," " Lamb 
and Hazlitt," "Shakespeare: The Man and his Work," 
and "Faiths and Folklore." He edited important edi- 
tions of Warton's History of English Poetry, Lamb's 
Letters, Dodsley's Old Plays, and Montaigne's Essays 
and Letters, as well as an eight-volume series of " Bib- 
liographical Collections and Notes." 

After a long life-time of neglect, the great French 
naturalist M. Henri Fabre seems at last to be coming 
into his own. The three volumes of selections from his 
Souvenirs entomologiques already published are to be fol- 
lowed by a complete translation into English, made by 
Mr. Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, of the entire ten 
volumes of the Souvenirs. Instead of following the 
chronological order of the original, the translator has 
devised a series of volumes each of which will be de- 
voted to a specific order of insects. The first of these 
has already appeared, under the title of "The Life of 
the Spider"; and the second, "The Life of the Fly," 
will be published immediately. This is to be followed 
by " The Wild Bee," with a chapter on the Red Ants ; 
and then in due course will appear volumes on the Beetle 
and the Weevil, the Wasp, the Grasshopper, the Butter- 
fly and the Moth, the Bug, and the Scorpion. The 
translation, which is an authorized one, will be published 
in this country by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. We note, 
in this connection, that besides the very interesting Life 
of Fabre by Dr. G. V. Legros recently issued in English 
translation, another and more extended biography has 
been completed by the naturalist's namesake and distant 
kinsman, M. Augustin Fabre.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL, BOOKS. 



It has been the custom of THE DIAL for many 
years past to place before its readers at this time 
a complete classified list of books announced for 
issue during the Fall and Winter season by the 
principal American publishers. These lists, care- 
fully compiled for our pages from authentic infor- 
mation obtained especially for this purpose, have 
come to be accepted as a feature of the utmost 
interest and value to librarians, booksellers, and 
private book-buyers. The list for the present year, 
herewith presented, contains over seventeen hundred 
titles, representing the output of about sixty pub- 
lishers. Considerations of space make necessary 
the carrying over to our next issue of two depart- 
ments "School and College Text-Books" and 
"Books for the Young." Some of the more inter- 
esting features among these announcements are 
commented upon in the leading editorial in this

A NEW AMERICAN QUARTERLY REVIEW OF 
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS 

THE YALE REVIEW was established two years ago to meet a demand among 
cultivated people in the United States for a review of the authority and importance 
of the great European Reviews. 

Its reception has been most gratifying, making it possible for the editors to begin 
the third volume with a list of forthcoming writers unequalled in this country in 
reputation and individual power. 

A unique literary institution, edited and published at Yale University, and yet not 
officially connected with that university, THE YALE REVIEW is already far on its way 
toward realizing its expectations of becomingthe leader among serious American reviews. 

Should you, as one of the particular group of cultivated people to whom THE YALE 
REVIEW is certain to appeal, permitth is opportunity to pass without becoming at once, at 
the commencement of its third volume, a permanent subscriber to it ? 

SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY OFFER 

In order to introduce the new YALE REVIEW the publishers will enter subscription 
orders to begin January, 1914, and send the October number free, for the regular 
subscription price of $2.50. Orders may be sent through booksellers, or direct to

THE MUSE IN A PET. 

In his brilliant but hopelessly wrong-headed 
essay on Victor Hugo, Frederic Myers com- 
ments upon a poem in "L'Annee Terrible" in 
which the author "paints at great length and 
with startling rhetoric the possibility that God 
may at last be found to have deceived us all 
along that 'the moral cosmos may be re- 
duced to a chaos,' and man, the sport of destiny, 
expire in a ruined universe." In that event, 
the poet informs us that he himself, "terrible, 
indigne, calme, extraordinaire," will denounce 
God to his own thunders. Whereupon the 
essayist remarks: "M. Hugo, forsooth, would 
be terrible! M. Hugo would be calm! M. 
Hugo would be extraordinary ! It seems likely 
that at the crack of doom even M. Hugo might 
see something more terrible and extraordinary 
than himself." Signer Marinetti, the Italian 
apostle of "futurism," would meet such an 
exigency unperturbed. That he can be " more 
than usual calm" under trying circumstances 
we know from his own admission. When, two 
or three years ago, he confronted in the Mer- 
cadante Theatre of Naples a hostile audience 
of "pastists," he showed his quality in a way 
which only his own words can fittingly describe. 
"Suddenly, among the parabolas of potatoes 
and rotten fruits, I caught on the fly an orange 
thrown at me. I peeled it with the greatest 
calmness, and ate it slowly, by sections." This 
daring action turned the tide; the audience 
which came to curse remained to applaud, and 
"I hastened, of course, to thank the bellowing 
crowd by hurling fresh insults at them." We 
are not told how many heads were broken in the 
scrimmage that followed, and our chief interest 
in the episode lies in the fact that there are still 
to be found somewhere in our indifferent modern 
world audiences who can get really excited over 
discussions of art and literature. If we could 
only detach from the subject to which the pink 
envelopes of our newspapers are devoted even a 
small fraction of the popular interest which it 
commands, and divert this interest to some sub- 
ject of high human concern, such as poetry or 
painting, we should accomplish something really 
worth while, and put all our expensive educa- 
tional institutions to shame. 

The bedlamite ravings of the futurists, and 



246 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



their nightmare creations of the pen and the 
brush, have at least this of value: they arouse 
passions and provoke thought. Worthier objects 
of passion and thought there doubtless are in 
the world of art, but a lively interest in things 
aesthetic, even if stimulated by the most ignoble 
examples, is better than no interest at all, for 
that way lies spiritual stagnation. Thus in 
poetry a Marinetti or an Ezra Pound may have 
his uses, and the Muse in a pet, or a tantrum, 
although bad-mannered and unconcerned with 
the amenities of criticism, may serve to remind 
us of the existence of Parnassus, a fact which 
men battening on the moors of philistinism are 
in danger of forgetting. As Mr. Scott-James 
has just said in " The North American Review," 
" poetry has now become a mentionable subject 
in decent society," which is a condition of things 
that we must applaud, even if we owe it to poets 
and critics who browse upon only the lower 
slopes of the sacred hill or who wallow in the 
morasses at its base. 

The futurist muse has very decided ideas of 
what she does not like in poetry, although the 
sort of thing she offers as a substitute is, to say 
the least, disconcerting. She is bent, according 
to Signor Marinetti, upon the destruction at any 
cost of these four intellectual poisons : "1, The 
sickly and nostalgic poetry of distance and recol- 
lection; 2, Romantic sentimentalism rippling 
in the moonlight, with its fatal ideal of woman- 
beauty; 3, The obsession of lust, with the tri- 
angle of adultery, the pepper of incest, and the 
exciting seasoning of sin in the Christian sense ; 
4, The deep passion for the past, accompanied 
by the craze of the antiquarian and collector." 
Poetry without these themes or sources of inspir- 
ation would be considerably at a loss, we should 
say. After such a clean sweep of his normal 
sustenance from the board, the poet might well 
feel himself, as Tennyson did after he had been 
FitzGerald's (vegetarian) guest for some weeks, 

" A thing enskied 
(As Shakespeare has it) airy light 
To float above the ways of men." 

The only writers of the past (poets or others) 
that futurism accepts as having at least groped 
toward the right path are Ernile Zola, Walt 
Whitman, Rosny aine, Paul Adam, Octave Mir- 
beau, Gustave Kahn, and Verhaeren. All the 
others are left to the outer darkness. 

But we must not forget the automobile and 
the aeroplane and the blast furnace, for these are 
types of the energy which is so dear to the futu- 
rist mind, and are the effective substitutes of- 



fered for all the sentimental rubbish of the past. 
With these symbols one can go far in the futurist 
world of creating, and it is no wonder that we 
find Signor Marinetti lecturing the English upon 
"ce deplorable Ruskin," who despised them so 
heartily. Futurism is nothing if not thorough- 
going, and it lays its axe at the very roots of the 
written language. Punctuation, adjectives, and 
adverbs are all to be abolished, and all verbs are 
to be used in the infinitive. When the rules of 
diction laid down for writers are relentlessly ap- 
plied, we get such a farrago as the following, 
which is taken from a sample piece of descriptive 
writing devoted to the battle-field: "Tours 
canons virilite voices erection telernetre extase 
toumbtournb 3 secondes toumb-toumb flots 
sourires rires ploff plouff glouglouglouglou 
cache-cache cristaux vierges chair bijoux perles 
iodes sels bromes jupons gaz liqueurs bulles 3 
secondes." It reads like a cipher cable code, 
and if such is to be the literature of the fu- 
ture, we shall all have to begin our education 
over again. The futurist manifesto offers us 
one delightful rule of conduct so inclusive as 
to make most further directions superfluous. 
"We must spit upon the altar of art every 
day." Simple and to the point ! Signor Mari- 
netti reminds us of the bad boy who, in "The 
Session of the Poets," created a scandal by get- 
ting up and shouting : " I disbelieve wholly in 
everything! There!" 

In a frequently quoted letter, Ibsen speaks 
of the time, now near at hand, when we shall 
advance with a leap into the coming age. 
"Hej! How ideas will tumble about us!" 
Ideas certainly tumble about us when we get 
into futurist company, and the degringolade 
of the old aesthetic order assails our ears with 
such a clattering as might be imagined if the 
gentleman in the futurist painting, " Nu descen- 
dant 1'escalier," should suddenly fall to pieces. 
It would be a matter for jest merely, were it 
not the logical outcome of that sinister tendency 
of our time to reject all the established teach- 
ings and ideals of the past, all the rules of con- 
duct and canons of belief by which the social 
and the intellectual order have thus far been 
kept together, and the history of civilization 
held in continuity. If we dally overmuch with 
the destructive notions that are invading our 
political and social life on every hand, and refuse 
recognition to the old settled sanctities of con- 
duct and belief, we shall assuredly be called 
upon to pay some kind of a penalty, and no 
light one, for our indecision. History will

always be mankind's best mentor, and the term 
"pastist," coined for reproach by our amusing 
futurist friends, will be accepted as a title of 
honor by every serioiis fighter for human wel- 
fare. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE LIVING SIGNIFICANCE OF LATIN, a so-called 
dead language, has never been more convincingly 
demonstrated than hy Miss Frances Ellis Sabin, 
assisted by Miss Loura B. Woodruff, in their excel- 
lent handbook on "The Relation of Latin to Prac- 
tical Life," described in its sub-title as a collection 
of "concrete illustrations in the form of an exhibit." 
Miss Sabin, who is at the head of the Latin depart- 
ment in the Oak Park and River Forest (Illinois) 
Township High School, has undertaken to supply 
Latin teachers and Latin students with such unan- 
swerable arguments in favor of Latin studies as 
shall forever stop the mouths of objectors to those 
studies. And her exhibit, as she calls it, is indeed 
impressive, showing, with the aid of graphic and 
other illustration, how the life and literature and 
language of ancient Rome are woven into the very 
texture of modern every-day thought and speech and 
action. Incidentally and unavoidably the significance 
of Greek to the world of to-day is often touched 
upon. An "outline" sketches in nine brief proposi- 
tions the plan of the handbook, and sixty ' exhibits " 
bring strikingly to one's notice the many and varied 
proofs of these propositions. Large wall- cards for 
the display of these proofs and illustrations accom- 
pany the handbook, the whole being prepared under 
the auspices of the Classical Association of the 
Middle West and South, and procurable from Miss 
Sabin. The author's list of " problems of to-day " 
that were "live questions in Rome" is of especial 
interest. First comes a humorously appropriate 
cartoon by Mr. J. T. McCutcheon, and then the list: 
"The high cost of living, election of candidates by 
direct vote of the people, relation between business 
and politics, government control of public utilities, 
maintenance of the army and navy, graft in the 
business world, methods of taxation, corruption in 
politics, the race problem, the labor problem, capital 
punishment, foreign relations, lawlessness, suffrage, 
class privilege, eugenics, divorce, education, religion, 
immigration." Probably the most generally con- 
vincing demonstrations in the book are those dealing 
with language and literature and illustrating the 
indebtedness of our daily speech, our familiar allu- 
sions, our habits of thought, our reading and our 
writing, to the language and literature and life of 
ancient Rome. Ample room is left for additional 
illustrations on the large wall-cards, thus calling for 
originality and resourcefulness on the teacher's or 
lecturer's part. Mention should here be made also 
of the many authorities quoted in favor of classical 
studies in modern education. 



REVISING THE VULGATE, in order to determine 
the exact wording of St. Jerome's Latin version of 
the fourth century, in compliance with the behest of 
Pope Pius X., will be a tremendous task for the 
commission appointed six years ago by papal decree. 
Individual members of that body will pass away 
and be replaced by others long before the work is 
completed, but the commission will abide, and will 
at last bring to an end the most stupendous under- 
taking in text-revision that the world has seen. 
Abbot Dom Gasquet, head of the Benedictine order 
in England, and chairman of the revision commis- 
sion, has come to this country to report the progress 
already made in the great work and to solicit finan- 
cial aid for its further prosecution. The biblical 
manuscripts to be hunted up and collated are beyond 
counting, but the ultimate fruits of all this dusty 
research will be, it is promised, of great value to 
Bible students of whatever shade of orthodoxy or 
heterodoxy. Benedictine scholars have been sent 
out by Abbot Gasquet to ransack the libraries and 
archives of Europe, from the sunny shores of the 
Mediterranean to the bleak steppes of northern 
Russia. Doors have been flung open to these emis- 
saries, and mouldering piles of parchment submitted 
to their scrutiny, so that by this time some fourteen 
thousand biblical manuscripts, containing thirty thou- 
sand pages, have been brought to light. Since it 
was impossible to gather this mass of material in one 
place for necessary study and collation, the modern 
method of photography has been employed with the 
ancient texts, and eventually there will be completed 
at Rome a library of folio volumes displaying with 
minute accuracy all the variations that, as far as can 
be learned, the St. Jerome version has ever under- 
gone. Already the book of Genesis has been thus 
revised and printed, and the Abbot hopes to live to 
see the completion of the Pentateuch and the Psalms. 
This is one of the scholarly labors that, like the 
Oxford English Dictionary and the Jewish Encyclo- 
paedia, inspire respect for the patient and commonly 
obscure and not too well-paid toiler in that field of 
arduous research whence issue so many of the useful 
and necessary literary tools that equip the reference 
rooms of our libraries, great and small. 


THE HIGHEST PRAISE OF A WORK OF LITERATURE 

is perhaps contained in the reader's sigh of regret 
that he himself could not have been its author, a 
regret not infrequently accompanied by an idle and 
foolish fancy that he might have been its author 
if he had only thought of it in time. It is oftener 
the form than the substance of a piece of writing 
that evokes this feeling the clothing in faultless 
language what oft was thought but ne'er so well 
expressed. Blanco White's famous sonnet, " Night 
and Death," pronounced by many admirers to be the 
most nearly perfect sonnet in the English tongue, 
contains no thought that has not occurred, more or 
less vaguely, to hundreds of other ponderers on the 
mysteries of existence; but so apt is the imagery 



248 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



and so fitting the language that one immediately 
recognizes a masterpiece in the little poem. Then, 
it may be, comes the query, Why did the English- 
speaking world have to wait so many centuries for 
this obviously best and, so to say, inevitable mode 
of expressing that thought? Another sonnet, chanced 
upon in a magazine ten years ago, struck at least 
one reader as voicing almost perfectly a thought 
familiar to thousands of reflective persons, but never 
before so aptly uttered. It was Mr. Nathan Haskell 
Dole's poem entitled " Man's Hidden Side," con- 
ceived in a mood not so very unlike that which 
prompted White's " Death and Night." Let it here 
be reprinted, to give point to this paragraph. 

" The Moon, that earthward turns her radiant face 

As if she would without reserve confide 

Herself to us, conceals a secret side 
Whereof no mortal ever hopes to trace 
The dark-environed clue. It is a place 

Where strange abysmal phantasms may abide, 

Where Gloom's abhorrent progenies may hide 
Emprisoned by the ebon walls of Space. 
Each one of us, however gay and bright 

To those that dream they know us we appear, 
However frankly we may keep in sight 

Our alternating phases through the year, 
Have, like the Moon, a side that lies in night, 

Unknown to those to whom we are most dear." 



READERS' HABITS are almost as many and varied 
as are the readers themselves. In support of this 
obvious proposition it will not here be necessary to 
adduce a multitude of instances, but it may be of 
interest to consider for a moment the very general 
tendency of the reading public to do unnecessary 
violence to books. The "gentle reader" leaves 
every book he reads in just as good condition, as far 
as the unaided eye can see, as when he began it. 
Not so the rude reader. At Mount Vernon, N.Y., 
where there is a considerable immigrant population, 
it has been found that books borrowed from the pub- 
lic library by the horny-handed sons of toil are not 
unlikely to receive hard usage. Especially is this 
true of books taken by Italian working men. There- 
fore it is that one now sees pasted on the covers of all 
Italian books in the library the following friendly 
appeal to the borrower (we give the English trans- 
lation, retaining the familiar thou's and thee's) : 
"This book is of wise advice and useful information 
for thee. Treat it well, as thou would'st a good 
friend. Do not rumple it. Do not soil it. Do not 
tear it. Think that after having been useful to thee 
it must be of service to a great number of thy com- 
patriots. To damage it, to tear it, to soil it, would 
give a bad impression of thee and prevent other 
Italians getting benefit from this book. Respect this 
volume for the good name and for the advantage of 
Italians!" Moreover, as an object lesson where 
needed, a copy is exhibited of " The Immigrant's 
Guide" so completely used up in one borrowing as 
to be of no further service, and by its side is shown 
a copy of Dante's " Divina Commedia " printed at 
Venice in 1529, and still in as good condition as 



when it left the press, nearly four centuries ago. 
Mr. John Foster Carr, in a recent address printed 
in "The Massachusetts Library Club Bulletin," re- 
lates the Mt. Vernon incident, and has other notable 
things to say about the relations between public 
library and foreigner. 

THE FRANKLINISM OF MAYOR GAYNOR was not 
so marked as to ensure the future coupling of his 
name with that of the Philadelphia printer and 
philosopher, but it is true that both had something 
of the same shrewd common-sense and homely 
wisdom, that both could give apt and terse expres- 
sion to this practical sagacity, and that both were 
men of the people, plain in their ways and simple 
in their tastes. Almost simultaneously with Mr. 
Gaynor's death there appears a volume entitled 
" Mayor Gaynor's Letters and Speeches," in which 
those interested in such comparisons can find pas- 
sages not so very unlike in style the published let- 
ters of Franklin; at least there is the likeness of 
pronounced individuality, of honest intent, and of 
great readiness in the expression of thought and 
opinion. Each man was distinctly a "character," 
largely because each dared to be himself; and 
probably Franklin would have said of his own 
style of writing very much what the late mayor 
wrote in answer to an inquiry from a newspaper 
editor : " I fear you will find no art in my let- 
ters. . . . What is the best way to write things, 
you ask? Often the best way is not to write them. 
But if you do, the simple way is the best." In 
one respect, however, it would be difficult to find 
an equal to Franklin as a letter-writer and auto- 
biographer, and that is the artless candor with 
which he tells us all the worst there is to be told 
about himself. Such astonishing frankness would 
be impossible with almost anyone else, and will 
be looked for in vain in Mr. Gaynor's writings, 
which, be it added, contain, here and there, more 
of acerbity, of passion, of lack of self-control and 
philosophic calm, than can be found in Franklin. 



EARLY CALIFORNIA MAGAZINES, the product of 
an age when Californians might be supposed to have 
had enough to occupy them in the mere getting of a 
living, were of a number and a quality that reflect 
credit on the literary aspirations of those gold- 
digging pioneers of more than half a century ago. 
At the late eighteenth annual meeting of the Cali- 
fornia Library Association, succinctly reported in 
"News Notes of California Libraries," Mr. Robert 
E. Cowan of San Francisco presented a paper on 
" The Magazines of California." Besides the un- 
successful ventures that died a very early death, 
there were "The Pioneer," " Hutchinson's California 
Magazine," "The Hesperian," and "The California 
Mountaineer." Soon afterward appeared " The 
Overland Monthly," made illustrious by Bret Harte's 
connection with it, and still in existence. Later Cali- 
fornia magazines, such as " The Land of Sunshine,'" 
" Out West," " Sunset," and " The Pacific Monthly,' 



1913]

are surprisingly numerous for a region comparatively 
sparse in its population, and their quality is credit- 
able, sometimes even more than that. Many of Cali- 
fornia's early periodicals and newspapers have passed 
into utter oblivion because, Mr. Cowan says, '' the 
libraries of early days neglected their opportunities, 
and at the present time disaffection is not altogether 
unknown. Much of the material for the history of 
California has disappeared forever because of the 
failure of those in responsibility to heed the fine old 
counsel, carpe diem" Perhaps, however, those in 
responsibility did heed the counsel, but in a too 
Horatian sense. A bibliographical study of Cali- 
fornia magazines will accompany Mr. Cowan's paper 
when it is printed in the proceedings of the meeting. 



ALL OK NOTHING OF AN AUTHOR is the rule of a 
certain class of rigorously thorough readers, and 
there is something to be said in its favor. Still there 
is more than a grain of truth in the assertion made 
by Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews in a recent magazine 
article on "Education through Reading," that "it is 
the mark or a great writer to have uttered a good 
deal of trash." Anyone can easily name, in the 
works of even his favorite author, certain books or 
parts of books that hardly add to the writer's fame. 
Who is there that reads with enthusiastic delight 
Shakespeare's "Pericles," or Scott's "St. Ronan's 
Well," or Dickens's "Hard Times," or Victor Hugo's 
long-winded digressions in "Les Misdrables," or 
Browning's "Luria," or Longfellow's "New En- 
gland Tragedies"? Voluminous writers must inevi- 
tably leave behind them much work inferior to their 
best, as they also leave much that is superior to 
their worst, and it is pure pedantry to insist on 
going straight through any given author after once 
beginning him. The mere satisfaction of being able 
to say that one has read all of Goethe, or Cowper, or 
Crabbe, or Thackeray, or James Fenimore Cooper, 
is not worth the labor required to win it, though 
many there are who read not for present enjoyment, 
but for the future fancied distinction of having read. 
President Andrews repeats the story of the young 
lady who wished to convey the impression of an 
acquaintance with Shakespeare, but when she was 
asked if she was familiar with " Romeo and Juliet," 
answered that she had often read "Romeo," but 
"Juliet" had always been out when she asked for it 
at the library. This recalls the utterance of another 
young lady who, after running over the entries under 
" Homer" in the card catalogue, proudly declared that 
she had read all his works except the opera omnia. 

THE BOOKSELLER'S POINT OF VIEW is one that 
the librarian ought now and then to try to take, 
with an effort of the sympathetic imagination, when 
he find himself inclined to clamor too loudly for a 
more liberal discount on his purchases. The book- 
dealer must live, even though some near-sighted 
buyers of his wares may not see the necessity. In 
proof of the really considerate treatment accorded 
to his library customers by the seller of books, 



listen to what Mr. William B. Clarke, the Boston 
bibliopole, said to the Massachusetts Library Club 
at its recent meeting in the halls of Williams Col- 
lege. His informal, heart-to-heart talk tended to 
show the exceeding smallness, if not less than noth- 
ingness, of the profit made on the sale of new books 
to libraries, as at present conducted. From the 
spring of 1912 to the spring of 1913 he had kept 
a careful record of the cost and sale of all books 
furnished to libraries at the regular library discount 
of ten per cent on net books and thirty-three and 
one-third per cent on others, and the final summing 
up demonstrated "a possible gross profit of .207 
per cent against a 28 per cent expense; but as fif- 
teen and one-half per cent of these books were re- 
turned, it left a gross profit on library sales for that 
year of .159 per cent against a 28 per cent expense. 
Unsalable books increased this loss still more when 
sold upon the bargain counter." This may not 
represent a fair average of profits realized, the 
world over, in supplying libraries with books ; but 
it is certain that these institutions, with many deal- 
ers bidding for their trade, do receive a not illiberal 
treatment. . . . 

ORNATE ORATORY, such as we associate with the 
names of Burke and Chatham and Patrick Henry 
and statesmen generally of the eighteenth century, 
and such as we were wont to select for purposes of 
declamation in our school days, is not common in 
these degenerate times of hurry and hustle and hard 
common-sense. All the more gladly, therefore, do 
we hail its brief revival in our national legislature, 
where Representative Gray of Indiana recently re- 
lieved the tedium of a long summer's dragging de- 
liberation over important issues with the following 
poetic effusion: "It has always been my practice to 
vote against the previous question where there has 
been no opportunity for full discussion. But this 
discussion began in the early springtime and has 
continued during the long, weary months of a torrid 
summer. The birds have nested and flown with 
their young; the flowers have bloomed and faded; 
the harvests have ripened and been garnered in; 
the beetles are already singing the dirges of a dying 
year; the fall has come with the sere and yellow 
leaf of decay, with wailing winds and naked woods 
and meadows brown and sere; the first breath of 
winter is upon our cheek to chill us. Looking 
squarely at my platform pledges to the people, I 
was ready to voce for the previous question." It 
need hardly be added that when the vote was taken, 
after this poetic burst in favor of the motion, it was 
triumphantly carried. 

PROMISCUOUS READING, in a sense not usually 
attached to the phrase, came up for discussion some 
months ago at a meeting of the North Midland 
Library Association of England. A paper was read 
by the city librarian of Peterborough on the question 
of providing separate reading-rooms for women, and 
the substance of it was a strong argument for the 
mingling of the sexes in their use of the public 



250 



THE DIAL

library's store of printed matter. Many of the older 
English libraries and even some of the newer ones 
have separate rooms for readers of the sex once 
known in that country as "gentle," but the Peter- 
borough librarian advocated their abolition for the 
following five reasons: the recent educational and 
social advance of women has placed them in a posi- 
tion where they themselves cease to ask for separate 
reading-rooms ; to provide such rooms where there is 
little or no demand for them would be an unwar- 
ranted expenditure; where there are such rooms 
they contain only papers and magazines peculiarly 
feminine in tone and character (and hence, pre- 
sumably, not over-inviting to large numbers of 
women readers, or remarkably valuable as litera- 
ture); duplication of other reading matter already 
available in the general reading-room is in most 
cases impossible because of the expense involved; 
and, finally, common reading-rooms for both sexes 
" tend to promote a better tone, a general raising of 
the standard of behaviour, and a keener apprecia- 
tion of the whole institution." The editor of the 
Baroda "Library Miscellany," commenting on the 
Peterborough librarian's paper, shows a far keener 
interest in the question than can be felt outside of 
India and the East, where the state of women is 
such that a special reading-room for their use is often 
necessary if they are to frequent the library at all. 


AKMINIUS VAMBEBY, who died September 15 in 
his eighty-second year, was a romantically interesting 
character as well as a very learned scholar, a daring 
explorer, and a prolific writer. Professor of oriental 
languages at Pesth University, he possessed a variety 
of learning, had been through a multitude of adven- 
turous experiences, and was the holder of almost 
innumerable degrees and honors and society mem- 
berships, such as are boasted by few occupants of 
academic chairs. Hermann Bamberger was his 
German-Jewish name before he Magyarized it into 
Arminius Vambery. Among his best-known books 
are "Travels in Central Asia," "History of Bok- 
hara," "Arminius Vambery: His Life and Adven- 
tures," "The Coming Struggle for India," "The 
Story of My Struggles," " Western Culture in Eastern 
Lands," and works on the literature, languages, and 
ethnography of Central Asia. He was born in pov- 
erty and forced to make his own way ; by what means 
he succeeded in doing it is most interestingly told in 
his own autobiographical writings.

PECULIARITIES OF THE PAY COLLECTION of new 
fiction in public libraries come to our notice from 
time to time, but thus far it seems to have developed 
no objectionable traits such as might warrant its dis- 
continuance. At Redlands, California, as is recorded 
in the Nineteenth Annual Report of the public library 
of that city, the original purpose was to let the pay 
collection include some of the ephemeral, temporarily 
popular fiction that it was thought undesirable to 
place permanently on the shelves. But the good 
people of Redlands did not view this policy with 



unanimous approval, some of the citizens regarding 
it as contrary to the intent of a free public library. 
Consequently it was decided to offer no books to the 
paying patron that were not also placed at the dis- 
posal of those unwilling or unable to pay a modest 
fee for a special privilege. The little incident is 
strikingly illustrative of certain not too amiable qual- 
ities in our common human nature. But there is 
one slightly redeeming feature to its unloveliness : 
on the Pacific coast the copper cent is all but un- 
known, so that not even the most rapid reader of a 
pay-collection novel could escape the necessity of 
parting with at least five cents for the privilege 
enjoyed a difference that would amount to some- 
thing considerable in the case of a novel-a-day reader. 

THE AUTHOR OF "ON THE BRANCH," known in 
the world of books as "Pierre de Coulevain," but 
whom the well-informed cataloguer places under 
"F" as "Mile. Favre de Coulevain," leaves many 
readers to regret her too-early death. Report avers 
that she was born in 1845 at Geneva, a suitable 
birthplace for one of her cosmopolitan tastes and 
international fame. She was a close observer of 
manners and customs, as can be seen in such works 
of hers as "L'lle Inconnue," in which persons and 
things British are subjected to her scrutiny, and 
"Noblesse Ame*ricaine," a title that explains itself. 
"Eve Victorieuse" and "Sur la Branche" are also 
among her well-known books. Translations of her 
chief works have appeared in English, if not also in 
other languages. From at least one of them, "The 
Unknown Isle," interesting revelations and hints as 
to her personal history may be obtained. "On the 
Branch " (rather perplexing in its title) has proved 
a popular novel in its English dress as also in its 
original French. ... 

MINUTELY SUBDIVIDED LITERATURE is clearly 
to be found on the shelves of the public library that 
makes the following announcement in its latest Bul- 
letin: "The reclassification of the library, which 
has been going on since last October, divides the 
books into ten main divisions, each division is then 
divided into ten sub-divisions, and each sub-division 
is again divided into ten divisions ; making in all 
some ten thousand different subject headings under 
which the books are classified. The library con- 
tains books on all these various subjects. Is there 
not one subject in which you are especially inter- 
ested?" Who would have thought that the products 
of literary inspiration could group themselves so 
symmetrically in a great army of books divided and 
sub-divided and sub-sub-divided by a constant divi- 
sor, ten? And with the increase of specialization 
in authorship, as in every other industry, will this 
process of sub-division continue until we have, not 
ten thousand, but ten times ten thousand little classes 
of literature, and presently ten times the latter num- 
ber, and so on ad infinitum ? The brain reels at the 
thought, and visions arise of mad-houses filled with 
ex-cataloguers from all over the library world.

THE MODERN ENGLISH NOVEL: 
SOME TENDENCIES. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
At the beginning of another publishing season, when 
the air is darkened with announcements of new books 
by the recognized concocters of fiction, it is customary 
for the press of this country to give a kindly word or 
two to the art of novel-writing. For this is the slack 
time of the year : most Londoners are out of town, en- 
joying their autumnal holiday; and there is not much 
of importance in the way of social or other domestic 
news. Parliament is up; the Balkan imbroglio, as a 
topic, has lost interest; Mexico is a long way off. Thus 
it happens that the hard-worked journalist turns his 
attention for a moment to matters of lighter import. 
He has made his annual discovery. Last year he found 
out that the novel had a tendency to increase in length. 
For some time an impassioned controversy was carried 
on as to the proper measure of a modern work of fiction. 
Should it be eighty thousand words (which had hitherto 
been regarded as normal), or something over a hundred 
and fifty thousand, as the Caines and Corellis, the Hichens 
and Bennetts, appeared to prefer? At length an ingeni- 
ous writer settled the matter by putting forward the 
unanswerable dictum that a novel should contain just 
as many words as were necessary for the adequate treat- 
ment of the story. Upon this the throng of popular 
novelists who had been contributing their various views 
to the discussion went back sadly to their work, wishing 
that they had thought of this excellent solution them- 
selves. But I do not know that many of them have 
acted upon it since. 

The discovery that has been made this year opens up, 
perhaps, a more interesting question. It is stated that 
the love interest is going out of fashion. That is to say, 
it is taking a secondary place. A well-known publisher 
comes forward to say that very few novels are submitted 
to him nowadays in which love, romantic or otherwise, 
forms the main motive. It is true that there is still, 
generally, a marriage somewhere in the book, but this 
no longer stands out as the one and only matter of real 
importance in the life of the characters concerned. Our 
novelists, it seems, are beginning to acquire a sense of 
proportion: they have at last recognized that it may be 
possible to interest readers in other subjects in poli- 
tics, or sociology, or Votes for Women. Their characters 
may be in love, but they do not waste all their time over 
it: they have other things to do in the world besides gazing 
at the moon and sighing for each other. All of which is, 
no doubt, a considerable step in the right direction. 

In the higher circles of fiction we may also con- 
gratulate ourselves upon the gradual extinction of the 
"happy-ever-after" school. This Victorian formula 
had a long and prosperous career, but it cannot be 
denied that it began to exasperate the judicious reader. 
The fiction monger of that epoch used to conduct his 
couple to the altar, after innumerable vicissitudes, and 
leave them there at the close of the last chapter, with 
the strains of Mendelssohn's Wedding March still ring- 
ing in their ears, with the tacit assumption that the real 
business of their lives was now over. It was a formula. 
The novelist is compelled, by the nature of his craft, to 
adopt certain conventions, but it is as well that he should 
change them from time to time. Even in our youth we 
could never quite believe in this postulate of theirs. It 
was too obviously at variance with the stern facts of 
human life. Clearly there were many married couples 



of our acquaintance whose state of bliss was incomplete. 
And, though we could not, by the nature of things, know 
very much about the matter, our minds rebelled against 
the thought that marriage should descend upon the 
happy couple like a rosy mist, cutting them off from 
any further participation in the drama of life. We 
were convinced that the most interesting period of their 
career was just beginning. They had only a superficial 
knowledge of each other's characters. They may have 
been devotedly attached to the ideals they had formed 
in their own minds, but we had a shrewd suspicion that 
these would not survive very long the closer analysis of 
domestic life. How would she get on with the servants, 
and how would he behave under the stress of leaking 
water-pipes and kitchen boilers and the noise of fractious 
or playful children? Clearly the wedding bells should 
come at the beginning of the story rather than the close. 

Briefly put, the above is the substance of the position 
taken up by our London journal. It touches, as you 
may perceive, only the fringe of the subject, and it 
is perhaps not strictly fair in its estimate of our Vic- 
torian novelists. Some of these adventured, successfully 
enough, into the post-matrimonial period, George 
Eliot, for example, wrote " Middlemarch " more than 
forty years ago. And, for the rest, a novelist must stop 
somewhere, preferably before the anti-climax. If he 
is out to tell a love story, the wedding of hero and heroine 
forms a more suitable halting-place than any other. 

The Victorian formula is not dead. In all probability 
it will last as long as the art of fiction. But I agree 
that it is no longer so prevalent as it was. Novelists 
have shown a tendency for some time to split up into 
sections; and those who still practice the romantic love 
story, pure and simple, have dropped to a lower plane 
in the estimation of critical readers. They still have 
their stars: some writers in this form, Mr. Charles 
Garvice, for instance, enjoy as large a sale as many 
men with more admired reputations. But they appeal, 
if I may say so without offence, to a less sophisticated 
circle. From the commercial point of view, it may be 
argued that this is by far the best circle to address. It 
is large, and growing: year by year the half-educated 
mass of the population assists to swell its ranks. We 
possess in England at the present time a class of readers 
who have just been admitted to the simpler joys of 
literature. They are, as yet, easily tired ; they do not 
want anything that makes the slightest demand upon 
their dormant faculty of reason; they require stories 
with a sufficiency of exciting interest and as much sen- 
timent as can be crowded between the covers of a single 
book. To these the romantic love story, in all its pris- 
tine simplicity, still makes the strongest appeal, and the 
enterprising craftsman who gave them anything else 
would soon find the best of reasons for regretting his 
temerity. Numerically, the servant girl and the wife 
of the small tradesman make up the bulk of our novel- 
readers to-day. And they want Romance and plenty 
of it: it is for them that our industrious leaders of the 
paper-covered book market contrive their entrancing 
stories of noblemen who seek their mates, not in the 
gilded halls of their peers, but from the flower girls in 
Piccadilly Circus or from the beggar maidens who 
wander homeless on the Thames Embankment. It does 
not concern them that the flower-sellers in the Circus 
are mostly ladies of a mature age, and that beggar 
maidens are rarely, if ever, to be found on the Embank- 
ment. Their work has no relation to life as it is: they 
depict some imaginary fairyland in which the conven-

tions of generations of sentimental predecessors take 
the place of real facts. 

Like most trades, this of the fiction-writer discovers 
a tendency to split up into numerous subdivisions. We 
still possess a few men who range freely, who seek to 
make the Universe their province ; but the majority 
select their own little patch, cultivating it with only an 
occasional incursion into strange fields. Indeed, the 
practice of novel-writing is now so universally diffused 
that the only chance for a new man is to specialise, 
to make, if possible, a name for himself in some not 
too crowded enclosure. Thus we have Mr. Arnold 
Bennett, who has done for the " Five Towns " of Staf- 
fordshire, the Potteries district, nearly as much as Mr. 
Thomas Hardy did for his Wessex. We have had Mr. 
Barrie and Mr. S. R. Crockett, and a host of others in 
various parts of North Britain ; Ireland has been handled 
by " G. A. Birmingham," Somerville and Ross, Mr. 
Shan F. Bullock, and a goodly band of ardent Celts; 
Mr. Eden Phillpotts and Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch rarely 
stir from the little sections of Devon and Cornwall that 
they have respectively marked for their own. Wales 
and Essex, Yorkshire and the fells of Cumberland, 
each possesses one or more capable writers of fiction 
who confine themselves pretty closely to their own par- 
ticular districts. And it is not only in locality that we 
specialize. There is an increasing tendency for our 
authors to confine themselves to a single subject, or 
even to a single type of character. Sociology has spread 
its tentacles, like some gigantic octopus, over all the 
recent novels of Mr. H. G. Wells, until there is some 
danger of the intrusive monster squeezing the life and 
interest out of his stories. Dr. Conan Doyle appears to 
have got himself entangled with a group of scientists 
and sportsmen, seeking adventure after the manner of 
the somewhat wooden figures created by the late Jules 
Verne. For a long time Mr. W. J. Locke was infected 
with the spirit of his Happy Vagabond, just as the 
author of " Raffles " seemed unable to get away from 
the society of that gentlemanly burglar. And there are, 
of course, a whole crowd of more or less capable writers 
who confine themselves to detective stories, or to melo- 
dramatic serials for the halfpenny papers, or to some 
other branch of their art for which they, or their agents, 
imagine they possess a special aptitude. 

I say their agents, for it is undoubtedly to these 
gentlemen that we owe a good deal of this specialization 
in modern fiction. Let a man once score a success in a 
story, and it is certain that every effort will be made by 
his business manager to induce him to work the vein 
that he has been fortunate enough to strike until there 
is nothing left. It demands considerable force of char- 
acter on the part of the author to refuse. From the 
commercial point of view, it is no doubt a mistake to 
leave a mine that still promises a good yield; from the 
artistic standpoint it has often proved a fatal error to 
begin attempting to repeat a past success. To imitate 
oneself may be morally more defensible than to imitate 
others; artistically it is the greater blunder. 

The public likes to have some idea of the sort of stuff 
it is going to get for its money. This in itself forms a 
strong inducement towards specialization. Those of our 
authors who feel an irresistible inclination to wander 
from the beaten track, to escape from the groove that 
the agent or the publisher has marked out for them, 
can always find means of regaining their liberty. I have 
been acquainted with more than one novelist who em- 
ployed pseudonyms when they desired to publish some- 



thing in a different genre from their usual work. Others, 
with Mr. Wells and Mr. Arnold Bennett, divide their 
works into several categories, classifying some of their 
stories as fantasies or romances instead of novels. It is 
permissible to cultivate more than one field as long as 
the boundaries are kept well marked. Perhaps, too, it 
would be impossible for any one author to do much more 
than this. The serious novelist, as apart from the simple 
story-teller, is expected to deal with what he knows: 
his imagination should at the least have a basis in solid 
experience; and, though some of us have lived strange 
lives, we are generally a little at sea when it becomes 
a question of dealing convincingly with the more violent 
crimes. 

Instinctively the author turns to the subjects that he 
knows best. And of romantic love there is probably no 
extant writer who does not imagine himself to have 
sufficient knowledge. Probably it is the most interest- 
ing, the most illuminating, experience that has ever 
fallen to his lot. This is why the love story, pure and 
simple, will never altogether die out. But it is a fact 
that we handle it with an increasing subtlety if we 
wish to get a hearing somewhere else than in the ser- 
vants' hall.

THE BRONTE LETTERS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Base interpretation, reflecting sadly on the life of a 
great woman, is, I believe, the result of the publication 
of the Bronte letters in the London " Times." The 
letters, as I understand, have been construed to disclose 
the love of a woman for a man who is indifferent to her, 
so indifferent that he scribbles vulgar memoranda on 
her persistent, amorous communications. This unpleas- 
ant insinuation, so unworthy of Charlotte Bronte, is 
refuted definitely and finally in " Villette " itself. Char- 
lotte Bronte never would have offered her love where 
it was unwelcome; such an act was opposed to her whole 
theory of life. (And, once for all, in this parenthesis, I 
disclaim, with the utmost scorn, every speaking suspicion 
of what are called " warmer feelings." Women do not 
entertain these "warmer feelings" where, from the 
commencement, through the whole progress of an ac- 
quaintance, they have never once been cheated of the 
conviction that to do so would be to commit a mortal 
absurdity; nobody ever launches into love unless he has 
seen or dreamed the rising of Hope's star over Love's 
troubled waters.) Who could doubt the almost quixotic 
chastity of the woman who wrote these words ? 

" I could not have expressed . . . such thought 
such scruple without risk of exciting a tyrannous 
self-contempt; of kindling an inward fire of shame so 
quenchless, and so devouring, that I think it would soon 
have licked up the very life in my veins." 

Charlotte Bronte's life was largely mental; she at- 
tached a significance, "rooted and active," to friendship, 
its evidences and its tokens; a mere letter from a friend 
was to her almost as vital as life itself, a source of 
inexpressible joy or unutterable woe. " Villette " fur- 
nishes countless proofs of this fact.

MB. SAI^TSBTJRY ox THE ENGLISH 
NOVEL,.* 



To ride solitary up the tourney field and ring 
one's spear in challenge against the Templar's 
shield, something like that it is to differ with 
Mr. Saintsbury in literary matters. Not that 
he has any of the qualities of Scott's bold, bad 
champion ; but his equipment in criticism is so 
complete, the mass of critical work behind him 
so formidable, that the mere blazoning on his 
tent, the fluttering of his pennon, are enough to 
keep challengers away. How one pair of eyes 
could have gathered in the harvest which he has 
stacked up and pressed down in his " History 
of Criticism " is beyond our feebler powers 
to understand. And he displays his acquisi- 
tions in a way to enhance their value. He is 
not only in literature, but of it. We would 
almost rather read Mr. Saintsbury than the 
authors he writes about ; and in a good many 
cases we admit that is what we have done. There 
is only one flaw in his panoply. He seems to 
have had little metaphysical training, at least, 
like Arnold himself, he scorns philosophy and 
bids it begone from the field of criticism, where 
innate and educated taste is the only guide and 
director. Well, it is possible to lay a course by 
the stars and dead reckoning, but the compass 
is a handy invention. 

Mr. Saintsbury's new book, " The English 
Novel," exhibits his immense reading and his 
gift of reanimating dry bones, as did his " His- 
tory of Criticism." It would be interesting to 
know which course of reading he found most 
wearisome, the forgotten or half-forgotten 
critics of Europe, or the dead or little-read 
novelists of England. Our first point of quarrel 
with him is in regard to the position of the novel 
itself in literature. We quote the words with 
which he concludes his book : 

" In the finest of its already existing examples it 
hardly yields in accomplishment even to poetry; in that 
great secondary (if secondary) office of all Art to 
redress the apparent injustice, and console for the ap- 
parent unkindness of Nature to serve as a rest and 
refreshment between those exactions of life which, 
though neither unjust nor unkind, are burdensome, it 
has no equal among all the kinds of Art itself." 

The second part of this sentence is undoubtedly 
true as regards human beings to-day ; but it is 
only true, we believe, because there has been a 

* THE ENGLISH NOVEL. By George Saintsbury. "Chan- 
nels of English Literature." New York: E. P. Button 
&Co. 



general weakening of intellectual fibre, a relax- 
ation in the power of attention, largely brought 
about by the excessive use of novels themselves, 
which have indisposed people for other forms of 
art, though these intrinsically may have more con- 
solation and refreshment in them. If we could 
bring back to life a Greek of the time of Pericles, 
or even an Englishman of the time of Pope, 
neither one of them might find much consola- 
tion or refreshment in the English novel. Pope 
concentrated a hundred novels in the Satires 
and Epistles, and a contemporary of his might 
prefer his portable phrases to the diluted exposi- 
tion of human nature in the modern novel. It 
must be remembered that the novel has only 
been in vogue, been the fashionable form of 
literature, for a hundred years. The reign of 
the novel began with " Waverley." Great novels 
had been written before that, but the form had 
always been considered a secondary and inferior 
one. 

The first part of Mr. Saintsbury's sentence 
quoted above we should challenge altogether; 
and we believe that he is too good a critic, too 
true a judge of literary values, to defend it. 
There are three things that make literature val- 
uable, thought, adequate or beautiful verbal 
expression, and the creative projection of human 
figures. Thought is the common possession of 
all forms of literature. You must have some- 
thing to say before you can write at all. There 
is no reason why a novel should not be as pro- 
found as a philosophical treatise or a great drama 
or poem. It may be a mere accident that no novel 
in existence does rank with the great Bibles of 
the world, or with the "Prometheus," " De 
Rerum Natura," "Hamlet," or "Faust." 

In the matter of expression, it is simply ab- 
surd to compare the very best prose of the very 
best novels with the verse of the great poets. 
These last not only have given us a sensuous 
form, music and sculptured perfection, which 
always delighted the world, until the flood of 
novels washed out of its mind the power of ap- 
preciating distinction, but by their superior con- 
centration they have made a thousand phrases 
which have entered into common parlance where 
the novelists have made one. 

In creativeness the novel may seem to be 
more on a level with other forms of literature; 
but even here the palm is not for it. The great 
figures of fiction which dominate man's imagi- 
nation, which have really swayed and moulded 
his life, are almost exclusively the protagonists 
of plays or poems. Rama, Rustam, Achilles, 
Prometheus, Hamlet, Lear, and fifty others, 



254

[Oct. 1 



these are kings whose reigns have been not over 
single countries but over whole continents, whose 
dominion has lasted not for a few years but for 
many centuries. The novel in its whole period 
of existence has projected but one creation that 
can rank with them Don Quixote. That it has 
produced one may be an argument that it can 
bring forth more ; but until it does so, it is un- 
wise to claim for it an equality of accomplish- 
ment with poetry. Secondary characters of great 
power and charm and beauty the novel has to its 
credit in vast numbers, but so has poetry and the 
drama. And these secondary characters of 
poetry retain a certain superiority. Has any 
hero of any French novel whatever exercised as 
much influence over the French mind as the hero 
of Corneille's play, "Le Cid "? We doubt it. 
Has any English heroine fascinated as many 
men or reproduced herself in the moods and 
manners of as many girls as Shakespeare's 
Rosalind ? We are quite certain that none has. 

What is a novel ? Mr. Saintsbury nowhere 
definitely defines the genus ; but the main pur- 
pose and most skilfully executed design of his 
book is to aggrandize one of its species, the 
novel of manners as the central type, any aber- 
ration from which is a falling away from per- 
fection. Why the novel of manners should be 
central any more than the comedy of manners 
is central in the drama, it would be hard to ex- 
plain. Tragedy, romantic comedy, fantastic 
comedy, all outrank satirical comedy of con- 
temporary life. Few critics would place " The 
School for Scandal" on a level with "King 
Lear," " The Tempest," or " The Clouds " of 
Aristophanes. Is there any reason why it 
should be different in the novel ? Neither the 
name nor the genesis of the novel indicates any 
such reason. Novel means something new, and 
presumably startling. The first novel we have, 
" The Golden Ass " of Apuleius, is a wild and 
grotesque tale of adventure. The early novels 
of Spain and Italy were of a similar character, 
except when they told discreditable tales of 
domestic life which we can at least hope were 
not a true reflection of average humanity. The 
close study of quiet, unexciting contemporary 
life is really a late arrival in the novel field, 
and even yet it cannot vie in popularity with 
other varieties. 

But Mr. Saintsbury is determined to see in 
this latter type the hoped-for accomplishment 
of all that the novel can do. His book is con- 
structed to make Jane Austen appear the apex 
of the English novel, up to whom everything 
previous led, and since whom everything has 



sloped down towards the abyss. He gives a 
really magnificent exposition of the art of the 
eighteenth century novelists, Richardson, Field- 
ing, Smollett, and Sterne; but he calls them 
"The Four Wheels," meaning, we suppose, 
the wheels of the chariot which is to bear Jane 
Austen to triumph. He slurs over Scott, hurries 
past Dickens, and, what is more surprising, half 
ignores Thackeray, in order to exalt his favored 
queen. 

What is the mystery of Jane Austen's superi- 
ority? Mr. Saintsbury seems to think that the 
life she depicts is more normal than that of any 
other novelist, and that she realizes it better. 
Now we do not believe that the life of the little 
coteries of county families which Jane Austen 
gives us is a particle more normal than the life 
which Disraeli describes in "Coningsby," or 
the life which Herman Melville projects in 
"Typee." There are communities existing in 
the world to-day that go about like the old 
Hindoo sect "sky clothed" and eat their dead 
enemies with innocent gusto, but who certainly 
consider their lives absolutely normal. 

Every literary artist must observe and must 
imagine. The life he deals with must go through 
the alembic of his brain and suffer a quantitative 
and qualitative change there. Miss Bates is no 
more "real" than Meg Merrilies. In her way 
she is quite as astonishing and as eloquent as 
the gypsy. Who ever knew a Miss Bates who 
revealed her character with every word she spoke 
and never faltered in stroke upon stroke of self- 
revelation? Jane Austen gives us the concen- 
trated essence of Miss Bates, and we might have 
lived with the original twenty years without 
knowing her as well as we do in an hour's read- 
ing. But this is the secret of all successful 
character creation, and Miss Bates is made by 
the same formula as Justice Shallow, Sir Toby 
Belch, Parson Adams, Dominie Sampson, and 
Micawber. The only difference is that she is 
not as interesting in herself as these others. In 
two characters, Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine 
de Burgh, Miss Austen did, by allowing herself 
a little more exaggeration than usual, achieve 
veritable triumphs. But what we want to insist 
on is that all her successful figures are made and 
modelled as every other good artist has wrought 
his. All of them ride hobby-horses. Mr. Ben- 
nett is always the ironical philosopher whose 
business it is to extract amusement from his 
wife and daughters. Mr. Woodhouse is always 
the valitudinarian who invites people to dinner 
and then advises them not to eat anything. 
Emma is always the intermeddling angel who 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



255 



disastrously manages other people's affairs. And 
so on. There is no new creative method. The 
fact that the hobby-horses ridden by these am- 
iable people are rather tame livery hacks, and that 
they do not prance and caracole like the steeds 
trotted out by My Uncle Toby, Jonathan Old- 
buck, Jingle, or Sairey Gamp, does not change 
the fact of their truth to type. And the fact 
that Miss Austen has only two preeminently fine 
creations, whereas Fielding, Scott, and Dickens 
have twenty, fifty, one hundred; and the further 
fact that the worlds projected by these novelists 
are immeasurably larger, nobler, more varied, 
than Jane Austen's narrow little domain, all 
this would seem to negative the idea that she is 
the culmination and climax of the art of novel- 
writing. 

We have no share in the second sight which 
Mr. Saintsbury as a Scotsman or a dweller in 
Scotland ought to be gifted with; but we can 
imagine a great critic of the future, a Mr. 
Saintsbury of the twenty-first century, writing 
of this book something as follows : " In the time 
of this critic there raged all over the world a 
craze for novels, somewhat analogous to the 
tulip mania in Holland or the excitement of 
the South Sea Bubble. Vast prices were paid 
for these curious and unsubstantial specimens 
of literature ; and the poet, the dramatist, and 
the thinker were relegated into the background. 
Especially did the critics of that day dote on 
the tame studies of ordinary life such as a 
schoolgirl with no experience could easily turn 
out. Luckily we have recovered from this 
lunacy, and the bloated and formless novel- 
thing has been shown its proper place in litera- 
ture, while the clear-cut, definite forms of art, 
the lyric, the narrative poem, and the drama, 
have come into their own. And the novels of 
the past, the huge galleons of a vast Armada, 
lie scattered or sunk around the shores of that 
fair island of Art, which they started out so 
proudly to conquer." 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



THE GAME OF INTERNATIONAL, POLITICS.* 



The running comment on current national 
and international affairs embodied in the vol- 
ume entitled "Problems of Power," by Mr. 
William Morton Fullerton, for several years 
a correspondent of the London " Times," makes 
stimulating reading, and leaves no doubt that 

* PROBLEMS OF POWER. A Study of International Pol- 
itics from Sadowa to Kirk-Kilisse'. By William Morton 
Fullerton. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



the author has an intimate knowledge of at 
least considerable portions of his subject. But 
though the book is written in an easy style, it 
will hardly be read by the generality of men 
because it presupposes a knowledge of modern 
national and world politics that very few pos- 
sess. 

The treatment is by all odds at its best in the 
portions which deal with the domestic affairs, 
both political and social, of France. Here the 
author's knowledge is evidently based on per- 
sonal observation at close range, and conse- 
quently what he tells us about the present con- 
stitution and government of France, and their 
relation to Clericalism and Reaction on the one 
hand and Syndicalism and machine politics on 
the other, is illuminating in the highest degree. 

Mr. Fullerton has also a good deal to say 
about other nations and peoples. His remarks 
about the United States are worthy of especial 
note. The American, having long since been 
labelled a dollar-chaser, will be surprised and 
probably gratified to find that "idealism is the 
most characteristic note of the American char- 
acter." However, we do not escape criticism. 
In repudiating their war debts the Confederate 
States took a step which is paralleled in our 
times only by the action of certain Central 
American States. The American is too much 
given to sport: his newspapers devote as much 
space to games as they do to home politics, and 
infinitely more than they do to foreign politics. 
Like others, the American is growing irreligi- 
ous ; he is also coming to believe that his fav- 
orite theory of equal rights has been tried and 
found wanting. He is realizing, though slowly, 
that his isolation in international affairs is com- 
ing to an end, partly as a result of the taking 
of the Philippines, partly and chiefly in conse- 
quence of the construction of the Panama Canal. 
A further result of the latter enterprise will 
probably be that the American will be forced 
to conform his favorite principle of the Monroe 
Doctrine to the Law of Nations. 

The domestic affairs of the several nations 
appear in this treatise only to give a basis for 
the discussion of international relations. Ob- 
viously one cannot in a few lines give an ade- 
quate resume of a study involving a multitude 
of details. Mr. Fullerton tells us that Germany 
carried on a highly, almost superhumanly, suc- 
cessful foreign policy from the time of Bismarck 
to 1898, "the critical year." In that period 
she managed to draw Austria and presently 
Italy into association with her in the form of 
the Triple Alliance. Consequently she could 



256 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



face the French desire for revenge with equan- 
imity, indeed, by virtue of her influence at 
St. Petersburg and of England's policy of 
"splendid isolation," she was really the dom- 
inant factor in all international matters. In 
1898 her leadership began to be feared and 
presently contested. France and Russia had 
already become friendly, the events of the South 
African War swept England into association 
with them, and presently the Triple Alliance 
was confronted with a competent rival in the 
Triple Entente. Germany, perceiving the dim- 
inution of her influence under these tendencies, 
has sought by every device known to diplomacy 
to disrupt the Triple Entente, with the con- 
trary result of solidifying it and seeing her own 
power decline until it was practically broken 
by the course of the recent Balkan War. 
" Kirk-Kilisse marks the end of an epoch, the 
Bismarckian, and the beginning of a new era." 

International affairs, which in general are 
not as satisfactorily treated as the domestic 
affairs of France, suffer still further because 
they are discussed with a considerable bias. 
Mr. Fullerton is a Germanophobe, and he can 
find little good proceeding from Berlin. 

" While France is still, in the conventional way, loyal 
to the appeal of great principles, respectful of accepted 
ideals of international law, and of recognized notions 
of justice, and correspondingly indifferent to the pure 
material aspects of any problem, . . . Germany, the 
great modern parvenu power, bereft of all deep-rooted 
historical traditions, unrestrained by precedent save 
that of the original sin of Alsace-Lorraine has been 
able to put herself abreast of the time and adopt me- 
thods best fitted to a period dominated by economic 
interests. . . . But the British principle that ' business 
is business ' has never, even in England, been allowed 
to become the sole principle of diplomatic action." 

The rhetoric of these sentences is more correct 
than their content. There is no less history back 
of Germany than of France, and their present 
governments are practically of the same age. 
And as for the restraint of precedent, it is ludi- 
crous to suppose that the precedents represented 
by the policies of France under the Bourbons 
and Napoleons, or by England's policies in 
China, South Africa, or Persia none of which 
give evidence of being better than German 
policies are of a kind to act as a wholesome 
restraint. If Germany is without such prece- 
dents she is thrice blessed. 

This tendency to pronounce the policies of 
the several nations good or bad according as 
they harmonize or conflict with England's in- 
terests runs through the whole volume. For 
example, Mr. Fullerton tells us that the United 
States ought to abandon the Monroe Doctrine. 



But then, being "innocent" in international 
matters, we ought to avoid being drawn into 
an alliance with Germany ; for if this happened 
the United States "would have to bear the 
responsibility of an act which would upset the 
entire balance of power in Europe, and result 
in a war involving the interests of the entire 
population of our planet." 

" Were the Americans of the United States, in the 
present state of the world, to succumb to the blandish- 
ments of Germany, and accept any exclusive arrange- 
ment with that Power, they would be selling their birth- 
right, sacrificing the essentials of what has made their 
history worth anything in the world's annals, and losing 
their ' lives, their fortune and their sacred honor.' " 

Horrible, if true! If, however, we withstand 
the "blandishments" of Germany, which would 
draw us into an international gang of land- 
grabbers, and ally ourselves with England and 
France, we shall secure the peace of the world ; 
"for the only influence in the world capable of 
putting an end to these predatory methods are 
the combined forces of the new British Empire, 
and a self-denying United States and France." 
(The italics are the reviewer's.) This dictum 
does not at all agree with England's recent 
seizure of a "sphere of influence" in Persia, 
a high-handed act which makes it apparent that 
not only France and the United States, but the 
new British Empire as well, should be "self- 
denying." EDWARD B. KREHBIEL. 



WILLIAM MORRIS AND His WORK.* 



A personality as fascinating as that of 
William Morris can scarcely fail to attract stu- 
dents. Indeed, there is warrant, aside from 
the two books we are about to consider, for the 
belief that interest in Morris and his thought is 
steadily increasing. And this is a hopeful sign ; 
for his message is important and ought not to 
pass unheeded. 

Mr. John Drinkwater has endeavored to 
estimate with critical exactitude the poetical 
achievement of a many-sided artist. His well- 
written book is in our opinion the most impor- 
tant contribution that has been made to the 
criticism of William Morris's poetry, and is, 
considered by itself, a notable critical work. 
Perhaps the chief thing he does is to insist, with 
well-placed emphasis, that Morris, in devoting

257 



himself to art, was not trying to get as far away 
as possible from an unlovely and detested world, 
but was by that very devotion doing the best 
work possible for that world. Thus his writing 
of poetry was not merely a solace, a kind of 
evening recreation after the arduous work of 
the day, but was a necessary part of the day's 
work, as useful and indispensable as any other 
labor ; and in so treating it, Morris was putting 
into practice the teaching of his great master 
Ruskin. 

Another interesting point which Mr. Drink- 
water insists upon, though with less success, is 
that Morris, essentially a narrative poet, had a 
fine understanding of the essential nature of 
dramatic poetry, in which chiefly "the develop- 
ment of character and the progress of idea 
through the medium of action " are to be shown. 
"Sir Peter Harpdon's End" at least demon- 
strates this well ; but Mr. Drinkwater is forced 
to admit that "Love is Enough" is in structure 
something of a failure, in that Pharamond, 
" instead of passing swiftly from stage to stage 
in pursuit of his end and snowing us that love is 
enough, pauses for long periods to tell us that 
love is enough." In other words, Morris, ex- 
pressing himself in a somewhat unusual medium, 
was carried away by the lyrical impulse, and 
made no strong effort to satisfy rigidly the de- 
mands of dramatic construction. 

On the subject of popular heroes Mr. Drink- 
water has some wise remarks (pp. 106 f.) which 
deserve to be quoted : 

" We decorate and honour our soldiers whose business, 
be it to destroy or to be destroyed, is, in any case, con- 
nected with destruction; those of our lawyers who are 
chiefly concerned with restraint and punishment; our 
politicians who spend their time protecting us from as- 
saults of neighbours and communities as commercially 
rapacious as ourselves, or, in their more enlightened 
moments, in adjusting wrongs that are the dregs in the 
cup of civilization. The functions of these men may 
be necessities of society, but they nevertheless apply to 
the small negative aspect of our state and not the great 
normal life. It is that which is, rightly, the concern 
of our creative artists ; but our creative artists are not 
decorated and honoured by the nation as such. . . . 
Nationally we acclaim the negative and neglect the pos- 
itive manifestations of man. Morris's art was, implic- 
itly, a challenge to this temper and a means of escape 
from it." 

Our only criticism of this view is that it is not 
half strongly enough put. America is sadly 
afflicted with the same disease ; her legislators 
would rather build battleships than universities 
or museums, and while voting pensions recklessly 
to the old soldiers, would not give a dime of gov- 
ernment money to a starving poet or painter 
or teacher. It is this attitude of mind that we 



insist should be met by the gospel of Ruskin and 
Morris. 

Mr. Drinkwater's book contains a few bad 
misprints. It was in 1857, not 1875 (p. 46), 
that Rossetti conceived the scheme of paint- 
ings for the Union. For "Glance" (p. 98) 
read "Glauce." For "Hemir" (p. 142) read 
"Heimir." For "Feurir" (p. 143) read 
"Fenrir." P. 142, 1. 2, read: "and of brother," 
etc. On p. 189, 1. 11, does not the writer mean 
"affect"? 

Believing that there was still room for a 
study dealing with the personality of Morris, 
Mr. Arthur Compton-Rickett has essayed to fill 
the gap. If one is thus led to expect from his 
volume a new fund of stories or an anecdotal 
biography, one is sure to be disappointed. 
Although the author "has sought the firsthand 
impressions of as many, as possible, of Morris's 
intimates and acquaintances," he has quoted 
very few Sir Philip Burne- Jones, Sir Will- 
iam Richmond, Mr. Belford Bax, Mr. Watts- 
Dunton, Walter Crane, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, 
and a few others, some anonymous. Nor can it 
be said that in this respect we get from his book 
much that is really new. For though it may 
be true, as he suggests, that "whereas X may 
see certain traits clearly, Z will see other points 
more vividly," on the other hand it is to be said 
that Morris's nature was by no means subtle or 
difficult to understand ; nor was he in any sense 
like Paul, who sought to be all things to all men. 
Morris had many interests, and, as some would 
put it, many talents, all of which he used. His 
activity brought him into contact with many 
different types of men ; but to all he was much 
the same bluff, hearty, hot-tempered, warm- 
hearted, positive, eager to see his ideas and ideals 
make headway in the world, a hater of shams, 
and above all a lover of beauty. It is not sur- 
prising, therefore, that there is no extraordinary 
variety in the accounts of him contributed to 
this volume by his friends. Yet we would not 
be understood as implying that they are devoid 
of interest ; altogether, the section called " The 
Manner of Man" gives us a very pleasing ac- 
count of Morris's personality. 

In discussing Morris's poetry, Mr. Rickett 
remarks that " he was not a great poet ; for to 
the great poet rhythmic beauty is the one and 
inevitable expression of his creative imagina- 
tion." We shall not insist that Morris was 
a great poet; but the reason was not, we think, 
that he expressed himself also in other forms, 
as painting and design. It is idle to assert that 



258

because a man can do three things he cannot 
do one thing supremely well; it is merely a 
vicious post hoc, propter hoc. If Morris missed 
the divine spark of the supreme genius, the 
cause is not, in our opinion, assignable by 
human judgment. Some have alleged that he 
was too facile, that he wrote too easily ; others 
have complained of his excessive narrowness; 
still others, of his sham mediae valism. That he 
was not seriously at fault in any one of these 
particulars can, we think, be successfully con- 
tended; yet this is not to assert that his place 
is with Shakespeare or Homer. Even the Bard 
of Avon (it is now permitted us to believe) was 
not impeccable, nor did he always write poetry 
of supreme loveliness ; yet few dispute his su- 
premacy. Morris himself excelled others in at 
least some points; Mr. Rickett rightly points 
out the general clarity, the ease, and the level 
excellence of his verse, in which he was superior 
to many of his great predecessors. 

The least satisfactory chapter in Mr. Rickett's 
book is that in which he discusses Morris as a 
craftsman. His account of Morris's activities 
in design is somewhat bare and meagre. He re- 
produces, of course, the prospectus of Morris, 
Marshall, Faulkner & Co., but says little as to 
the variety or the extent or the success of their 
business. We should like to know about some 
of the churches and other buildings, public or 
private, which have been enriched by their win- 
dows or other products ; more about the revolu- 
tion in popular taste which their work effected. 
Moreover, this chapter needs illustrations, which 
Miss Gary in her volume fortunately provided. 
In fact, the work and influence of Morris as a 
designer, the work in which he gloried, calling 
himself proudly "a master artisan," has yet to 
be adequately described. 

Mr. Rickett is more fortunate in setting forth 
Morris's views on social reform. Whatever we 
may think of Socialism, there can be no doubt 
that Morris presents his noblest aspect when 
viewed as a teacher of society. Writing ro- 
mances or toiling at Merton Abbey was far more 
congenial to him; but he saw that before the 
beauty he loved could be generally appreciated 
and sought after, the whole attitude of society 
must be changed, and competition must give 
way to cooperation. Competition may be the 
life of business ; but being based essentially on 
selfishness, it inevitably leads to wrong notions 
about work and its products. The world has 
gone so far in the wrong direction that it will 
take a long time to reconstruct things; and 
probably some of the notions of the early 



Socialists will prove utterly unsuited to the 
coming State; but their fundamental conten- 
tion seems sound, and we appear to be moving 
steadily toward its realization. 

To the popularization of the Socialistic creed 
Morris undoubtedly contributed much. But it 
is not as a Socialist that he will be longest 
remembered, or even as a designer and adorner 
of our everyday world. When the social abuses 
against which he strove shall have been forgot- 
ten, when even the buildings which his art 
adorned shall have crumbled, men will still, we 
believe, delight in the tales in which our modern 
Chaucer set forth with imperishable dignity and 
grandeur the elemental passions of that romantic 
world, ever old yet ever new, which was to him 
so real, so possible that he sought constantly to 
bring it into actual being the world of Jason, 
and Alcestis, and Paris, and Ogier the Dane, 
and Gudrun, and Sigurd, and Brynhild. As a 
teller of tales, he stands by himself ; and in the 
long pageant of time the age which produced 
him can never be put to shame.

MEN AND EVENTS IN OUR EARLY 
NAVAL, HISTORY.* 



In narrating in detail the services performed 
by our cruisers and privateers in the Revolu- 
tionary War, Mr. Gardner W. Allen has per- 
formed a patriotic duty. Already favorably 
known because of his briefer treatises on our 
naval war with France and with the Barbary 
Corsairs, the historian follows in this more 
ambitious work the methods made familiar in 
those volumes. He relies primarily upon official 
records, both in this country and in England 
and France, piecing these out with personal 
letters and diaries and with extracts from the 
newspapers of the time, scanty though these 
last appear to us to-day. But the story as a 
whole is most impressive, the more so because 
the author has included, as far as was possible 
with existing materials, the operations of the ves- 
sels sailing as privateers under authority of the 
several states, outnumbering greatly the ships 
commissioned by the Continental Congress.

gland, from Paul Revere's ride to the evacuation 
of Boston, every American school-child is made 
aware. But who knows of the doughty O'Briens 
and their deeds at Machias, Maine, less than 
two months after the Concord fight, though 
there has been a naval vessel ever since to keep 
their name from forgetfulness? Who has ever 
heard of the capture of the good ship " Hellish,'' 
laden with military clothing and stores for 
Burgoyne's army, and diverted by Captain Jones 
to the uses of Washington's half -clad forces? 
Yet the operations of our ships and sailors kept 
pace with our land operations from the begin- 
ning of the war to the end, and it was a French 
fleet that made the victory at Yorktown pos- 
sible, even as the Machias incident bespeaks 
the temper of the colonists quite as much as 
Lexington, and the loss of the supplies on the 
"Mellish" aided in bringing about the surren- 
der at Saratoga. 

It is in the recital of these seemingly minor 
events that Mr. Allen's book is chiefly valuable, 
though of course the stress is rather upon the 
more sensational and better known deeds of 
the navy, as chiefly exemplified in the brilliant 
career of John Paul Jones. Poor as we were 
in those days, ill-organized as the Congress was 
for dealing with naval affairs, it is probable that 
more than two thousand privateers sailed forth 
under our new flag ; and their services were of 
prime value to the patriot cause, not only in 
such affairs as that of the "Mellish," but in 
causing the British people to exert pressure 
upon their government to bring the war to a 
close through the commercial losses they thus 
sustained and the terror created by the ap- 
pearance of hostile craft on the very shores of 
Albion's supposedly inviolable isle. 

Of the lack of efficiency shown by our gov- 
ernments, state and national, Mr. Allen speaks 
briefly and wisely. Had the lessons been learned 
which are written so largely in our failures 
during this early period, there would have been 
no second war of independence necessary to free 
our ships and sailors from heavy wrongs. For 
the rest, the book is clearly and unpretentiously 
written, well printed and indexed, and illus- 
trated interestingly with scenes and portraits 
from contemporary sources. 

Mrs. Reginald de Koven, in leaving the field 
of fiction for that of accurate historical writing, 
has in no way allowed her manifest talents as 
an interpreter of character and as a descriptive 
writer to lapse, and the result is a welcome 



relief from the German method which deems 
everything of value in history, however intrin- 
sically uninteresting. To deal in the German 
way with such a hero of romance as John Paul 
Jones would have been futile, and the reader 
may well rejoice in Mrs. de Koven's sympathy 
for the lover Jones proved himself to be, as well 
as fighter. Her painstaking research, evidences 
of which abound throughout her two fine octavo 
volumes, has brought out the romance of Jones's 
private, no less than of his public, life, so that 
the work possesses both the fascination of a novel 
and the serious value of authentic and fully 
documented history. 

The historian here has had not only to set 
forth accurately the facts of Jones's career, but 
to remove a cloud of doubts and false surmises 
left from the slipshod work of at least one previ- 
ous biographer, The portrait drawn is convinc- 
ingly true ; if lacking a little in such qualities 
of heroism in daily life as we must instinctively 
feel to be improbable, it gains greatly in human 
qualities. What strikes the reader most, per- 
haps, is the tremendous efficiency exhibited by 
Jones while afloat, and the even profounder 
effort required to secure ships with which to ex- 
ercise his manifest talents. A stronger nation 
would never have allowed such a genius to 
remain ashore a moment longer than necessity 
required ; as it was, his talents were wasted for 
months and years, during which he strove in 
vain to obtain a command, now from Con- 
gress, now from the French Crown. 

It is through the urgencies he was thus forced 
to display that his character loses much of ro- 
mantic glamour. Finding himself deprived of 
one ship after another at the moment when he 
had demonstrated his superiority over every 
other American sea-fighter, he was compelled to 
resort to the methods of an almost remorseless 
creditor to procure another ship and crew, until 
it is not too much to say that everything he 
accomplished was in spite of conditions rather 
than because of them. Considering the wire- 
pulling and jealousy he was so persistently 
engaged in at home and abroad, his contem- 
poraries are hardly to be blamed for regarding 
his persistency as a nuisance, contrasted as it 
was with their own inertia and lack of vital 
enthusiasm. 

Notwithstanding the fact that Jones is our 
one naval hero of the Revolution, the result of 
all this is that the concluding chapters of Mrs. 
de Koven's work, dealing with his services to 
Russia after the close of our war, are the most

engrossing of the entire book, and the gaps left 
by earlier biographers and historians are at last 
completely filled. The reviewer may be par- 
doned an expression of regret that room was 
not found for some of the ballads and other 
literature dealing with John Paul Jones, who is 
here proved to be himself a poet of sorts, 
such pieces as "The Yankee Man-of-War," 
quite the best naval song of the Revolution, 
Walt Whitman's "Would you hear of an old- 
time sea-fight?" taken down from the lips of an 
ancestor who was with Jones on the "Bon- 
Homme Richard," as well as more modern verse 
dealing with the cruise which bore his body back 
for permanent sepulture in the land of his 
adoption. 

As Jones was the chief naval hero of the 
Revolution, so was Oliver Hazard Perry the 
foremost figure upon the waters in the second 
war with Britain ; and Mr. James Cooke Mills 
has done well to devote a well-printed and vera- 
cious volume to him in this centennial year of 
his great victory. The story is vividly told, and 
the author's complete sympathy with so inter- 
esting a subject adds to its value, though it 
sometimes presses historical fact somewhat hard. 
There was little need, for example, to revive the 
forgotten tale of Elliott's delinquency on the 
memorable day that gave the United States the 
command of Lake Erie, or to pass over in com- 
plete silence Chauncey 's exploit on Lake Ontario, 
which was needed to round out Perry's victory. 
Nor should Perry's only less distinguished 
younger brother, Matthew Calbraith, have re- 
mained quite unmentioned. But these are errors 
of omission, no more. 

It is a deeper matter for regret that someone 
did not go over Mr. Mills's work and reduce it 
to ordinary rules of grammar and style. What, 
for instance, can be made of such a sentence as, 
"The gunboats were generally armed with a 
single twenty-four pounder, two of which were 
stationed off Stonington," or "The frequent up- 
risings of which the regency was noted," or 
" The heartrending tragedy of the River Raisin 
and other localities followed in succession," or 
the complete confusion of " creditable " with 
" credible " ? Similar examples of carelessness 
abound, and lead to errors in statement of fact, 
as where on page 104 the " Trippe " is said 
to be commanded by Lieutenant Holdup and 
on page 145 by Lieutenant Holdup Stevens. 
Nor should such a book have been published 

without an index. 

WALLACE RICE. 



A GREAT GERMAN SOCIALIST 
AND STATESMAN.* 



Shortly before the middle of August there 
died at Zurich the most eminent of contempo- 
rary German socialists, the sole survivor of the 
remarkable group of leaders by whom were laid 
the foundations of the German Social Democ- 
racy a generation and more ago, August 
Ferdinand Bebel. It is a cause for gratulation 
among students of social and political move- 
ments that before his death Herr Bebel the 
"Red Pope," his adversaries denominated him 
committed to writing his recollections of the 
men and measures of the early days of the 
German socialist propaganda. There is cause 
for regret, however, that the Autobiography in 
which these recollections are recorded was com- 
pleted (the portion of it, at least, which has 
reached print) only to the year 1878 ; although 
if we are not to have the entire work as pro- 
jected, the portion which has been printed, 
dealing as it does with the remoter and more 
formative period in the Social Democracy's 
growth, may be assumed to be of the largest 
interest and value. 

The career of Bebel was one of continued and 
inspiring triumph over adversity. The condi- 
tions surrounding his boyhood were hard and 
narrow. His father, a non-commissioned officer 
in the Prussian army, died in 1844, when the 
boy was but four years old ; his mother died 
nine years later. The rudiments of an education 
were acquired in a poor-law school at Wetzlar, 
but at the age of thirteen the youth was thrown 
entirely upon his own resources and prospect 
of further schooling had to be abandoned. In 
1853 he was apprenticed to a master-turner, and 
five years later he began tramping about the 
country as a journeyman. In 1860 he appeared 
at Leipzig, where steady employment was found 
and where, in February, 1861, he attended his 
first public meeting of workingrnen and joined 
his first workingmen's society. In both politics 
and industry the times were unsettled, and the 
opportunity afforded a restless spirit such as 
Bebel to agitate, to argue, and to organize was 
unlimited. In May, 1863, Lassalle's "Mani- 
festo," commonly regarded as the starting-point 
of the German Social Democracy, was published; 
and shortly afterwards there was formed the 
General German Labor Union, whose purpose 
was to make of labor, in accordance with 
Lassalle's ideas, an organized power in politics.

Bebel, who from 186 3to 1872 served continu- 
ously as vice-president of the Leipzig Society for 
the Promotion of Knowledge among the Work- 
ing Classes, at first opposed the propaganda 
for manhood suffrage, on the ground that "the 
workers were not yet ripe for it," and long held 
out against the general programme of the Las 
salleans. In truth he was not a socialist until, 
having occasion to read the writings of the Las- 
salleans in order to combat them, he fell under 
conviction and was won over. Gradually, how- 
ever, he became a socialist of the socialists, a 
universal suffragist, and an outspoken enemy of 
the entire social order based on capitalism. "I 
was a Saul," he says, " and became a Paul ; and 
a Paul I have remained even unto the evening 
of my life, more than ever convinced of the 
justice of my beliefs ; and so I shall remain to 
the end, as long as my strength is left me." 

In 1867 Bebel was elected a Labor member 
of the North German Diet. In 1871 he was 
chosen to a seat in the newly constituted 
Reichstag, and, except during one prolonged 
interval of imprisonment, and during the years 
1881-1 88 3, he was at all times thereafter until 
his death a member of Parliament. From the 
first he participated actively in debate. He 
refused to vote the subsidies asked at tfee be- 
ginning of the war with France, and he opposed 
the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. By his in- 
dependence of speech and action he, of course, 
incurred the displeasure of the authorities. In 
December, 1870, he was imprisoned on a charge 
of attempted high treason; and in 1872 he was 
tried and condemned to two years of confinement 
in a fortress. Released in 1875, he was im- 
prisoned again for six months in 1877, on a 
charge of libelling Bismarck. These periods 
of enforced inactivity, however, but afforded 
opportunity for reading and study, and the 
Government appears to have arrived at the 
conclusion that to add the element of martyr- 
dom to the sources of power which the man al- 
ready possessed would be a mistaken policy. 
At any rate, there was no further interference 
with his personal freedom. 

The present volume brings us only to the eve 
of the attempts on the life of the Emperor in 
1878, and the anti-socialistic legislation by 
which those unfortunate episodes were followed. 
This was also the year in which there took place 
the final amalgamation of the several organiza- 
tions which have entered into the composition 
of the Social Democratic party, so that it affords 
a convenient division point in the history of the 
great movement with which Bebel's name will 



ever be linked. The writer, in summing up the 
situation at this point, says: 

" The play was ready to begin. It was intended to 
be a tragedy, in the course of which the Social Dem- 
ocratic party was to be sacrificed upon the altar of the 
monarchical and capitalistic interests. But, as before, 
it did not 'come off'; we turned the tragedy into a 
comedy, and the Hercules who came forth to strike us 
down with his bludgeon was himself laid low after an 
inglorious ten years' war against the hated enemy, and 
cumbered the field of battle with his corpse. Whereas 
in the old days of the Empire the battle-cry of the ad- 
vancing armies was 'To me, Guelph! Tome, Ghib- 
belline ! ' it was now ' To me, Bismarck ! To me, 
Social Democrats ! ' ' 

In style, the narrative is simple and straight- 
forward ; in substance, it is interesting and often 
illuminating. It reveals a forceful, intense, yet 
kindly personality ; and it tells a story that no 
interpreter of modern European affairs can 
afford to ignore. Especially instructive are the 
comments which are made upon Bismarck's 
effort to exploit the interests of labor in the 
earlier years of his ministry, the intimate char- 
acterizations of Liebknecht, Schweitzer, and 
other socialist leaders, and the more or less 
incidental portrayal of the habits, ideas, and 
aspirations of the German workingman in the 
third quarter of the nineteenth century. But 
there is nothing in the book that is superfluous, 
little that is even unimportant.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF CRIME AND 
PUNISHMENT.* 



Gabriel Tarde, whose work on "Penal Philosophy" 
has recently been translated for the " Modern Crim- 
inal Science Series," was an ornament of the legal 
profession, a judge of wide experience, a scholar, a 
psychologist, and an eminent sociologist'; his writings 
have stimulated thought in every country on the 
themes he discussed. 

First of all, as a criminologist, Tarde is a severe 
critic of the school of Lombroso, whose disciples 
have, in Tarde's opinion, over-estimated the import- 
ance of the inherited physical causes of anti-social 
conduct. The criminal is not a madman ; the insane 
may injure the person or property of citizens, but 
they are not responsible for their deeds and should 
be held in safe custody in a hospital. The notion 
that the criminal is simply a savage turned loose in

modern society, an example of atavism, is dissected 
and rejected. Nor is the offender a degenerate, 
although degenerates are likely to commit crime. 
The theory of epilepsy as a constant cause of crim- 
inality is set aside. It is probable that Tarde has not 
given due weight to physical defect in this causal 
series which ends in crime. Many competent ob- 
servers in all lands have been sure that prisoners 
are inferior on the average to the group from which 
they come ; and our author himself does not wholly 
reject this factor. 

The explanation which, according to Tarde, ac- 
counts for the most decisive facts is psychological 
and sociological in character. When we have seg- 
regated all the imbeciles, epileptics, and lunatics in 
educational, medical, and custodial colonies, we shall 
still have to deal with a large body of offenders who 
are nearly enough normal to be treated as respon- 
sible for their actions. The most fundamental dis- 
tinction to be made is that between rural and urban 
offenders, having as sub-groups violent criminals 
and thieves. 

Naturally the distinguished advocate of the theory 
of imitation, as an explanation of conduct in gen- 
eral, seeks to apply this theory to the phenomena 
of crime; and while he may overlook other elements, 
he certainly makes good use of this unquestioned 
fact. Since he wrote the book now published all 
the psychologists have been examining his view of 
imitation, and their debate still continues. It is 
interesting to note some of the methods of applying 
the theory. The vices and crimes of to-day which 
are found in the lowest orders of the people de- 
scended to them from above. " Drunk as a lord " 
is a proverb which is now applied to common in- 
ebriates, but which points back to the time when 
nobles vied with each other in feats of drinking. 
Irreligion is copied from the learned and exalted. 
Vagabonds are the contemporary representatives of 
noble pilgrims and ministers of the Middle Ages. 
Poisoning is now a crime of the illiterate; but once 
it flourished in palaces. We have professional 
murderers because the example was set by rich men 
who hired bravos and assassins. The glorification 
of war and soldiers bears some of the blame. 
Aristotle classed brigandage with agriculture and 
stock-raising as a natural industry available to man 
for the procuring of his subsistence. Says Tarde : 
"If we concede to the economists that all wealth 
which is not acquired as the fruit of labor is the 
result of plunder, whether brutal or disguised in 
some manner, we can form an accurate idea of the 
enormously important part played by crime in the 
social functions." It would be interesting to have 
exact references to the orthodox economists who 
claim that all possessors of wealth who have not 
come into their possession by their own labor must 
therefore be plunderers and parasites. The diffi- 
culty is the one which Robert Burns cites, the power 
to see ourselves as others see us. "We reproach 
the savages who poison their arrows, and we ex- 
haust our brains to devise strange engines of de- 



struction, grape-shot, torpedoes, which in the twink- 
ling of an eye can sink the most formidable vessel 
of war and mow down two hundred thousand men 
in an hour on a single battlefield." England car- 
ried on a campaign against the slave trade abroad, 
while it left its women and children to physical 
and moral ruin in mine and factory. "There is 
nothing to equal the progress of our political and 
military inhumanity, unless it be the depth of its 
unconsciousness; our newspaper polemics breathe 
nothing but deadly hatred; instigation to murder, 
the glorification of assassination, no longer astonish 
anybody in them. The inroads made by immorality 
upon morality, by dishonesty upon honesty, are as 
continuous as they are imperceptible. The tendency, 
in drawing rooms, seems by preference to be, as we 
are aware, to go to the extreme limit of respecta- 
bility, and to strive to extend that limit ; so much so 
that after a certain length of time, in a very lively 
society, a person can only continue to be respectable 
by saying the most indecent things possible." 

In our country these accusations cannot justly be 
applied to the majority of the wealthy, either to 
their business standards or to their social inter- 
course; but there can be no question that idleness 
in the second generation of inherited wealth, with- 
out any regulating belief in responsibility for earn- 
ing income, is producing its natural fruit, and that 
the example is pernicious. The crowded city, with 
its excitement, its conflicts, its allurements to excess, 
furnishes only too many base models for imitation. 
The city sets an evil example to the rural population, 
and crime spreads to the country by imitation. 

Tarde defends the notion of personal responsi- 
bility against writers of the positive and naturalistic 
school ; but he is a determinist to the core. The con- 
troversy is an old one, and there is no prospect of its 
coming to an end in our time. It may have some 
importance ; certainly our author states and defends 
his system of metaphysics with learning and subtle 
ingenuity, although most men will watch the debate 
very much as they do the feats of legerdemain, and 
go away puzzled and mystified. The point at which 
we can agree is that a man of sound mind who com- 
mits crime should be treated in a different way from 
an insane or feeble-minded person who performs the 
same act. Moral detestation is not only natural and 
rational, but it is a necessary part of wholesome re- 
action against anti-social conduct. If burglars and 
murderers are simply sick men to be pitied and cured, 
if they are not to be made to feel the reprobation 
of all right-minded people, we lose one of the most 
effective weapons of social defense, and one of the 
most powerful incentives to resist temptation. If it 
is monstrous to punish an idiot, it is just as monstrous 
to look upon a base assassin as simply a victim of 
"brainstorm." "When we shall cease to hate and 
stigmatize the criminal, crime will multiply." 

But this does not mean that society is to pursue 
the object of its just reprobation with eternal punish- 
ment. Wicked and loathsome as he may be, the 
criminal remains a person, with the rights and the

possibilities of a human being. Sentimentalism has 
no place either in relief of the indigent or punish- 
ment of the offender. True charity will be careful 
to avoid artificial creation of lazy parasites and 
malingerers. The administration of justice will re- 
form the guilty man, if this is possible ; and, if he is 
incorrigible, we are wealthy enough to " pay for the 
luxury of kindness." This kindness will take the 
form of supporting him to the end of his days, if 
necessary, at public expense ; but he will be deprived 
of liberty, compelled to live as a celibate, denied 
the coarse pleasures for which he cares most, and 
required to work for the daily bread which keeps 
him alive. 

More important than all this punitive machinery 
is the social demand that privileged people spread 
among the evil-minded minority an example of their 
own honesty. "To improve the guilty, to civilize 
bandits, is difficult and costly, and could not be 
called a good investment of time and money ex- 
pended. But this is an obligatory extravagance"; 
it will not pay, but it is duty. What will pay is 
what Tarde does not fully discuss : a system of pre- 
ventive and constructive legislation which will make 
reformatory prisons needless as rapidly as possible ; 
education, training, supervision, and control of neg- 
lected children and youth until they are all habitu- 
ated to work which earns a living and to recreations 
which do not corrupt. 

In dealing with the "indeterminate sentence," 
conditional liberation, and the parole system, Tarde 
is very unsatisfactory. His allusions to American 
experiments do not reveal any knowledge of the 
work of our supervision of conditional liberty. This 
very successful method must therefore not be judged 
by his fragmentary treatment. At the same time, 
Tarde does not oppose the tendency to individualize 
the treatment and to train convicts for liberty during 
a period of surveillance, and he recommends the 
principle. "It is thus not while in the cell that 
the convict can really gradually begin to improve 
morally ; it is only after he has left his cell. . . . 
Malefactors are game of a particular species, very 
hard to capture, which no one knows what to do 
with after it has been captured, and which it is as 
dangerous to set free as it is embarrassing to keep." 
Step by step, with vast patience and skill, the per- 
verted man must be helped to walk in freedom, until 
law-abiding conduct is second nature and the danger 
of relapse has been reduced to a minimum. 

In this immensely difficult task of reforming the 
morally deformed the supreme factor is a faithful 
personnel. Almost any system works well with a 
competent administrator ; while the best system fails 
in the hands of spoilsmen, incompetent, coarse, 
brutal, untrained. It is at this point alone that edu- 
cated men can make themselves felt in the adminis- 
tration of correctional institutions: they can insist 
on the merit system of selecting officers by examin- 
ation, probation, professional training, with security 
of tenure as long as they give evidence of efficiency. 
Tarde insists that modern society can supply such 



men. " Our society is better down below than it is 
on its surface; it has, like jewel cases, as Joubert 
would say, ' its velvet on the inside.' It ought to be 
possible to bring together in a prison the worst 
human brutes and the finest types of men, such men 
as Cartouche and Vincent de Paul. Let search be 
made for the latter ; in the end they will be found." 
But they are rarely found by a governor whose prin- 
cipal and dominant purpose is to get rid of trained 
officers and to instal, with good salaries, his favorite 
henchmen, to whom he owes political debts and who 
mock at the need of education and training. 

Tarde favors the retention of capital punishment 
as a means of deterrence and of elimination ; but he 
confesses that the evidence of intimidating influence 
is unsatisfactory, that the judicial killing of a dozen 
bad men out of thousands has little value in dimin- 
ishing their numbers, that statistics are unreliable 
and impossible to interpret. He does not adequately 
develop the method of permanent segregation of 
dangerous criminals through an extension of the 
" indeterminate sentence " with proper judicial con- 
trol. In spite of lending his high authority to the 
retention of capital punishment, the balanced state- 
ment of the facts may fairly be claimed by aboli- 
tionists as favorable to their plea. But no instructed 
abolitionist wishes to do away with this "rudiment " 
of savage ages without at the same time multiplying 
and strengthening the measures of social control of 
all youth who are forming anti-social habits, and of 
retaining in custody not only all incorrigible criminals 
but also all degenerates, insane, epileptic, and feeble- 
minded persons whose progeny are certain to be a 
perpetual menace to the order of society and to secu- 
rity of life, property, and morals. By a vigorous and 
prolonged effort, with the necessary financial invest- 
ment, we could in a few generations have all the 
advantages of the natural law of extinction of the 
unfit without reverting to the cruel methods of nature. 

" So o'er that art which you say adds to nature 
Is an art which nature makes." 

The conclusions of Dr. Gustaf Aschaffenburg, as 
embodied in his volume on "Crime and Its Repres- 
sion," have long since found numerous advocates in 
America, and have been embodied, not without pro- 
test, in the so-called "indeterminate sentence" laws 
of several states. Yet the eminent author rarely 
alludes, even faintly, to American examples; per- 
haps, as another German writer has recently said, 
because it is unpopular over there to cite the doings 
of the young Republic. We are not particularly 
wounded by this slight, for history will do us justice; 
and the last International Prison Congress recorded 
in its proceedings a testimony to our influence on the 
world movement. 

The eminent author, as a psychiatrist, starts from 
the basis of experimental science and not from rules 
established by precedents in an unscientific past. 
For this reason he is clear and decided where Tarde 
hesitates and splits hairs. Yet he is not dogmatic 
in his certainty; he bases his conclusions on a wide

study of psychology, forensic medicine, and statistics, 
as well as on the judgments of many others, like him- 
self, who have had intimate contact with prisoners 
in correctional institutions. 

Among the causal factors affecting the kind or 
quantity of crime are mentioned variations of sea- 
sons, race, religion, occupation, alcohol, prostitution, 
gambling, and superstition. Poverty and alcohol- 
ism are regarded as the chief direct incentives to 
harmful conduct. Both socialists and prohibitionists 
may draw powerful weapons from this armory. 
Among individual factors are considered parentage 
and training, education, age, sex, domestic status, 
physical and mental conditions of the offenders. 
It is noteworthy that this distinguished physician 
rejects the idea that the criminal has inherited a 
specific criminal nature. Crime is not a disease. 
Yet criminals are known to be inferior to ordinary 
citizens, both physically and mentally, and they often 
inherit part of their defects. "Weakness of body, 
mind, and will helps to account for the fact that 
these particular persons yield to the pressure of 
temptation and fall ; once fallen it is difficult to keep 
them on their feet thereafter. Therefore the protec- 
tion of society calls for a vigorous and persistent 
policy of elimination. Those who, immediately after 
release, go back to theft, burglary, rape, and arson 
should be kept under an indeterminate sentence, 
and prevented from injuring others, as is done with 
the dangerous insane. The short sentence in jail 
corrupts the harmless offender and does not reform 
the habitual. 

Education, economic improvement, and restric- 
tion of the drink traffic will have' considerable value 
as preventive agencies, especially with youth; but 
society ought to face the fact that there are many 
so weak in body and mind that they cannot be 
trusted with freedom in ordinary competitive life. 
Eugenic ideas come to light at several points and 
deserve attention. 

While Dr. Aschaffenburg is safely behind the 
most advanced experimental legislation in the 
United States, his facts, arguments, and eminent 
authority will greatly reinforce the progressive pol- 
icy which already has the support of the American 
Prison Association and of the American Institute 
of Criminal Law and Criminology, as well as of 
able representatives in the American Bar Associa- 
tions. CHARLES RICHMOND HENDERSON. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Rambles in -^ n inspiring account of his mental 
book-land with development, as promoted by the 
a boobtover. rea ding of all that is best in ancient 
and modern literature, is given by Professor Oscar 
Kuhns in his book entitled "A One-Sided Autobi- 
ography: Containing the Story of My Intellectual 
Life" (Eaton & Mains). Preparing himself tor 
college with no teacher to guide his studies, and 
with only the night hours free for the purpose, Mr. 



Kuhns was admitted to Wesleyan University with 
but few conditions, and there pursued, with an 
enthusiasm now become too rare, the old classical 
course leading to the bachelor's degree ; but he adds 
a confession of peculiar significance when he says : 
"Yet I do not think I enjoyed the pure delight of 
reading in college so much as I did before going 
there." Berlin, Paris, and other centres of learning 
were afterward visited, and some of the greatest 
scholars of the later nineteenth century were listened 
to with profit. From first to last, however, Mr. 
Kuhns seems to have been his own best guide in 
the realm of literature, breaking his own path down 
through the ages, and ordering his studies after a 
system of his own. His taste in books is truly 
catholic, and the range of his reading remarkably 
wide, while the intimate, personal touch he gives to 
his talk about his favorites imparts a charm to his 
chapters such as is not found in every collection of 
literary essays. Dante is the author he has studied 
most faithfully, taught to others with the greatest 
ardor, and read and re-read with the most unfailing 
enjoyment which is all in accord with what he 
says of "that phase of my own nature which is per- 
haps the deepest of all, a sense of the divine and the 
spiritual in and over and beyond all things material 
in life." Of his passion for poetry he says he can- 
not tell when it began. " Away back in the mist of 
childhood years I can see that it existed, and amid 
all the vicissitudes of life it has continued to broaden 
and deepen, until to-day it seems to include in itself 
all the charm I have found in music, or the plastic 
arts, in nature, the joys of home and friends, the 
beauty of woman, the charm of innocent childhood, 
and the deeper aspirations of the soul toward the 
spiritual world." Some graceful lines of his own 
prefixed to the volume show the author to be himself 
not lacking in the accomplishment of verse. Greater 
care in verifying quotations and book-titles (slippery 
and treacherous things even with the best of mem- 
ories) would have improved the book; and 'more 
vigilant proof-reading would have prevented the 
occurrence of occasional misprints. 

A French " Sprawly " is the only word which 

estimate of adequately characterizes the volume, 

Meredith. translated from the French of M. 

Constantin Photiades, entitled " George Meredith : 
His Life, Genius, and Teaching" (Scribner). M, 
Photiades is an enthusiastic admirer of Meredith, 
and a minute student of the master's works ; but he 
has little critical insight, and still less capacity for 
synthesis. Fortunately, the book is made up largely 
of straight narrative, in which the author is facile, 
and of comment upon citations, in which he is often 
felicitous. The intervening patches of general criti- 
cism contain much mere verbiage, which passes now 
and then into undiscriminating adulation with an 
amusingly Gallic strain to it. " A Faith on Trial " 
is characterized as " a magnificent poem of melan- 
choly"; Mr. Thomas Hardy, because of his touching 
little elegy on Meredith, becomes "a visionary bathed

in purest rays of light." The chapter on " His Life " 
is purely factual, though vivacious. That on " His 
Genius "resolves itself, after a little beating of wings, 
into a careful and interesting summary, in ninety 
pages, of " Harry Richmond "; the author's predi- 
lection for this novel, with its comparatively light 
and superficial narrative, is quite characteristic. 
That on " His Teaching " is, as might be expected, 
the most sprawly of all ; it tells the English reader 
nothing that is not better told in already existing 
books and articles in English. The remaining two 
chapters are the best. "A Visit to Flint Cottage," 
apart from its touches of the melodramatic, gives a 
picture of Meredith which we should not willingly 
do without. The novelist himself does most of the 
talking, on such subjects as Tennyson (whose " In 
Memoriam " associates itself in the speaker's mind 
with " psychic crises of young clergymen silently 
tormented with doubt" but failing not in the end to 
conform), the English language as a vehicle for 
poetry, FitzGerald's "Omar," Swinburne, the critics 
("each of them is at best but the slave placed near 
the conqueror to remind him of his mortal condi- 
tion "), the relationship between his own poetry and 
prose, the significance of France, etc. These topics 
are common, of course, in the recently-published 
Letters of Meredith ; but the master's remarks dur- 
ing this interview are none the less fresh and wel- 
come. The chapter on "George Meredith's Art" 
contains some thought-provoking things about the 
novelist's style. That the defects of this style are 
due to Meredith's constant attempt "to sift circum- 
stances, to weigh them with care, and with a result 
always beneficial to sound judgment and art" is cer- 
tainly a truer view than that they arose, as a well- 
known American critic has asserted, from confirmed 
dilettantism. It is interesting, also, to find a 
thoughtful French reader maintaining that "thanks 
to the wizard Meredith, English idiom is emanci- 
pated"; and that Meredith effected a much-needed 
" union of English poetry and English prose." A 
final point must be noted in regard to this uneven 
book : it exaggerates Meredith's affiliations with the 
French. The author quite misses the fundamentally 
Anglo-Saxon trend of his hero's temperament ; with 
the result that Meredith here appears, on the whole, 
" an ultra-Gallican gentleman " like ReneVs fiance*, 
at whom he pokes such fine fun, for that very quality, 
in " Beauchamp's Career." 

Records of two Mr ' Hu g h B ". C " Pollard's volume, 
journalists iil the " A Busy Time in Mexico : An 
land of unrest. Unconventional Record of Mexican 
Incident " (Duffield ) , is appropriately named both 
in title and sub-title. A busy and exciting time 
the author undoubtedly had; and his record is 
"unconventional" to the extent of being inaccurate 
in so many particulars as to create the suspicion 
that it may be exaggerated in others. It contains, 
however, some extremely interesting matter that 
has appeared in no previous volume on Mexico, 
and its score or more of illustrations are from 



photographs hitherto unpublished. It describes the 
personal experiences of the author, who first landed 
in the state of Chiapas near the Guatemalan fron- 
tier ; and after some time spent in that region pro- 
ceeded to the City of Mexico, arriving there in time 
to have his interest awakened in the Madero revolt. 
He then assumed the r6le of correspondent for 
some American newspapers, was present at several 
of the skirmishes in the neighborhood of the capital, 
and finally left the City of Mexico on one of the 
sections of the train which bore ex- President Diaz 
to Vera Cruz and into exile. In a postscript writ- 
ten apparently in London, he describes the assassi- 
nation of Madero and speculates upon the probable 
future attitude of the United States toward Mexico. 
Had the author prepared himself for his visit to 
Mexico, and for writing a book, by a study of Mex- 
ican history he would not have slipped into such an 
error as the following: "Vera Cruz the rich city 
of the Holy Cross as Drake termed it." It was 
Cortez who established the city and named it "La 
Villa Rica de la Santa Vera Cruz." Eminently 
appropriate is the characterization of Mexico in the 
title of Mr. Henry Baerlein's volume, " Mexico, the 
Land of Unrest: Being chiefly an Account of what 
Produced the Outbreak of 1910, together with the 
Story of the Revolution down to This Day" (Lip- 
pincott). But the book fails utterly to fulfil the 
promise of its title-page, much to the disappoint- 
ment of the reader eager to know something of 
"what produced the outbreak of 1910," and "the 
story of the revolution down to this day." In the 
first place, the author's English is at fault, and his 
style is cryptic. This may be due to the influence 
of his mother tongue; but whatever the cause, the 
reader may toil through some of his paragraphs, 
extending over six or seven pages and skipping 
from one subject to another, and arrive at the end 
with a confused feeling as to what it is all about. 
The author's position is distinctly anti-Diaz, and 
he is hopelessly committed to the previously-pub- 
lished accounts of the slavery in Yucatan and the 
inhumanity of Diaz. But the character of the book 
is little improved by the reproduction of crude car- 
icatures from Mexican papers, or by the author's 
chapter entitled "Diaz at the Door of Hell," which 
reads like an undergraduate skit in a college annual. 
It should be said that the book contains a fine map 
of Mexico folded within a pocket attached to the 
front cover, and a very good collection of illustra- 
tions (excepting the caricatures above mentioned). 
The appendices contain a useful glossary of Spanish- 
American terms and some interesting notes on the 
native languages. 

Germany is preeminently the land of 
socialism. At the general elections of 
1912 more than four and a quarter 
million votes were cast for socialist candidates, and 
one hundred and ten of these candidates were re- 
turned to seats in the Reichstag. This, however, 
tells but a part of the story. It is true that a large 



266

proportion of those who vote for socialist candidates 
are not full-fledged socialists, and furthermore, that 
the socialist party as such has never yet been strong 
enough to enact a law or to assume an active share 
in the administrative system. But on the other hand 
it is to be observed that the socialism of the " reds " 
does not occupy the field alone. There is also the 
socialism of the crown, more restrained and less com- 
prehensive, but just as truly socialism; and through- 
out a generation this monarchical, or state, socialism 
has been carrying the Empire step by step in the 
very direction in which the " reds " would have it 
go. The pace is not swift, but it is seemingly sure. 
German state socialism, as it is familiarly known, 
came into being in the days of Bismarck and comprised 
from the outset a programme of state ownership and 
other state enterprise intended to alleviate social 
distress, to promote public prosperity, and thereby to 
cut the ground from under the feet of the Marxians, 
Rodbertians, and other extremists. Its protagonists 
were Wagner, Schmoller, Schaeffle, and Schonberg, 
and its first great convert was the Iron Chancellor 
himself. Already in a number of the German states 
the principle of the public ownership and control of 
railways, mines, and other utilities had found appli- 
cation ; and beginning with the enactment of the 
sickness and accident insurance laws of 1883 and 
1884, the Empire, under Bismarck's guidance, em- 
barked upon a cautious but far-reaching programme 
of socialistic operations. In a modest and well- 
written volume entitled "Monarchical Socialism in 
Germany " (Scribner), Mr. Elmer Roberts describes 
the progress and present status of this programme. 
He shows what has been done in respect to the state 
control of railways and other public utilities, the 
development of labor exchanges and the remedying 
of unemployment, the taxation of land, the regula- 
tion of trusts, the upbuilding of the navy, and a 
number of other matters, and he predicts the con- 
tinued advance of Germany along the pathway thus 
marked out. The impression, indeed, is left with 
the reader that, in the main, the notable prosperity 
of the German people to-day is attributable to the 
following of this course an impression quite the 
contrary of that to be obtained from Mr. Price 
Collier's recent book, "Germany and the Germans." 
Mr. Roberts has long been a representative of the 
Associated Press in Germany, and he writes out of a 
considerable fulness of experience and observation. 

Under the title, "French Prophets 
of Yesterday" (Appleton), Professor 
Albert L. Gue"rard of Stanford Uni- 
versity has written a most dispassionate and objective 
history of French religious and philosophic thought 
during the Second Empire, from the standpoint of 
its contribution to the solution of the religious ques- 
tion in France to-day. And as the question now 
being faced in France is, in an acute form, the same 
that America will face to-morrow, and that England 
is already beginning to face, the valuable lessons of 
the book have much more than a merely national

significance. The four main strands of progress 
during the era before the new scientific spirit irra- 
diated thought were Catholicism, with its literary 
analogue in Romanticism and its travesties in the 
various cults of evil; Protestantism, which never 
had a chance in France because it could only make 
a wide enough separation from the authority of 
Catholicism to fall into the other extreme of Free 
Thought and again be lost; Voltairianism, which is 
spiritually barren; and Humanitarianism, which is 
only a spasmodic faith mediated by social and polit- 
ical crises, and which is powerless as an every-day 
guide to the best living. The author traces these 
faiths and their failings, exhibits the work of such 
critics of their tendencies as Renan, and shows pretty 
conclusively that Modernism within the Catholic 
church, the present-day hope of so many thinkers, 
is an impossible solution of the difficulty because it 
is at the outset simply a contradiction in terms. 
"Shall we close this review on a discord?" he asks, 
after showing that supernaturalism is out of the 
purview of rational speculation, and that naturalism 
alone is not a religion but merely descriptive in its 
function. And he can only answer that question by 
emphasizing the fact that both supernaturalism and 
naturalism point to the aspirations of man. And 
that man has aspirations and ever strives to live by 
them, is, in this day of criticism and doubt, the only 
solid fact to which the religious inquirer may cling 
with any degree of certainty and comfort. 

Thesiorv Careful study of a fascinating sub- 

ofanold ject is manifest in Mr. Hilaire Bel- 

Romanroad. i oc g monO g rap h O n "The Stane 
Street" (Button), in which he presents, first, some 
general considerations on Roman roads in Britain, 
then takes up "the particular case of the Stane 
Street," the general line of the road and its four 
divisions or "limbs," the camps or "mansiones" 
along its course, its historical character, and the 
modern divergences from the ancient highway ; 
next follows a discussion of certain details in suc- 
cessive sections of the road ; and, finally, there are 
appended notes, a folding map, and a full index. 
Sketch maps in abundance are printed with the 
text, and landscape drawings, some of them of 
much beauty, are furnished by Mr. William Hyde. 
Stane Street ran from Chichester to London, or, 
more specifically, to London Bridge, and the prob- 
able method by which it was surveyed, with the 
conjecturable reasons of its occasional deflections 
from a straight line, afford matter for research 
and surmise of an interesting sort. Mr. Belloc 
handles his theme with skill and learning, and it 
is a pleasure to follow his argument and to ac- 
company him in his journey over the historic road, 
much of which still appears to be in use, as a 
modern macadamized thoroughfare, with certain 
stretches not yet brought up to date. In his zeal 
to acknowledge English indebtedness to the con- 
quering Roman, he goes rather too far when he 
asserts that it is impossible "to prove one institu-

tion or one inherited handling of material things 
to have descended to us from the outer barbar- 
ism," that is, from non-Roman origins. Surely 
our daily speech is full of Anglo-Saxon words in- 
dicating the inheritance of both institutions (take 
merely the terms home, wedlock, king, earl, knight) 
and of the handling of material things (as borne 
witness to by such agricultural terms as plough, 
hoe, rake, thresh, winnow) from sources other 
than Roman and older than the Roman occupation 
of Britain or the extension of the Roman dominion 
beyond the Alps. However, we would not quarrel 
with the author's enthusiasm for his chosen theme, 
since to it the book owes its charm as literature. 



The recent 
revolution 
in China, 



Mr. Frederick McCormick's "The 
Flowery Republic" (Appleton) is a 
book of considerable value to one 
who wishes a full statement of the details of the re- 
cent revolution by which the oldest empire became 
over night the youngest republic. Apart from the 
narration of facts, however, this study of the revolu- 
tion offers little of worth. Moreover, the chronology 
of the revolution is not so clear in Mr. McCormick's 
treatment as one would like to have it, since the 
writer inverts the time order on occasion in his 
effort to attain a journalistic realism of style. 
Beginning with his own appearance on the scene 
after the beginning of the outbreak, he alternates 
throughout the book between the reporter's account 
of what he sees and the historian's statement of the 
main events. This method affords at times interest- 
ing sidelights upon incidents and personalities of the 
revolution, and at times clear statements of impor- 
tant episodes in their proper relation; but the two 
styles of narration are not happily blended, and each 
blurs the impression made by the other. Indeed, a 
decidedly blurred impression is left upon the reader 
by the whole book. One never feels quite certain 
whether the author possessed accurate and adequate 
knowledge of the Chinese people, nor does one know 
certainly whether the author's opinion of them and 
of their present leaders is on the whole favorable or 
unfavorable. Compliments bestowed freely in one 
chapter are in full collision with heavy condemnation 
in a neighboring section of the treatise, so that the 
reader is left with the feeling that the author is a 
safe prophet, no matter what turn events may take.

differentiates itself from the thousand and one other 
narrations of the same famous history in the con- 
centration of attention on the fifteen most eventful 
and significant months of her " long and weary 
pilgrimage" (to quote her own phrase), and the 
summary treatment, in the form of prologue and 
epilogue, of the less stirring earlier and later years. 
The bulk of the book has to do with the murder of 
Darnley, the precipitate Bothwell marriage, the im- 



prisonment in Lochleven Castle, and the defeat at 
Langside, leaving about one-quarter of the volume 
to cover the remaining events of Mary's forty-four 
years. The author declares himself to be an im- 
partial chronicler, not a partisan, and his straight- 
forward narrative seems to prove that he is unen- 
tangled by the fatal fascinations of his heroine, 
although he has been paying her attentions for 
nearly two decades. Original sources, he says, 
have been consulted in the preparation of his book, 
and many are " now utilized as biographical data 
for the first time." No notes, however, or bibli- 
ographical references are introduced, the evident 
purpose being to present the Queen of Scots in a 
few clear and telling strokes, with strict avoidance 
of irrelevant details. In this Mr. Shelley has suc- 
ceeded. The book is well illustrated, chiefly with 
portraits.

to 1898, and is packed with details drawn chiefly 
from the files of the London "Times." Mr. Gretton 
writes well, and has given us a number of chapters 
that are both interesting and valuable; his emphasis 
on the importance of the labor movement and his 
account of the vicissitudes of trade unionism are to 
be especially noted and commended. But his chief 
purpose has been to give an account of everything 
that interested English society during the period 
covered, and this has led him to include a mass of 
really trivial details that have only a passing interest 
and had but a slight effect on the course of events. 
One of his chapters is headed "Ireland, Egypt 
and Jumbo"; and more than a page is given to the 
importance of the popular song, "Ta-ra-ra-boom- 
de-ay," as indicating the state of English taste in 
the early nineties. There are many other indications 
of erratic judgment on the author's part which ob- 
scure the real excellences of his work. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In a certain very popular novel, with a very popular 
hero, that hero's name is not once disclosed, but he is 
always spoken of as " the Virginian." In Miss Marie 
L. Marsh's juvenile chronicle, "Auburn and Freckles" 
(Browne & Howell Co.), the chief character is likewise 
nameless; he is always "the freckled boy." His ad- 
ventures are varied, amusing, and unfailingly boylike. 
One cannot tell beforehand what he will do, but it is 
sure to be something delightfully characteristic of a 
red-headed, freckle-faced boy with the instincts proper 
to his kind. His friends help to give variety to the 
narrative; and there is very little danger that any 
reader, adult or juvenile, will go to sleep over its pages. 
The freckled boy is a thoroughly likable youngster, 
worthy of a place in the same class with Tom Sawyer

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



and Tom Bailey and the rest of our boy-favorites in lit- 
erature. The writer's rendering of boy-talk is success- 
ful, neither over-done nor falling short of verisimilitude ; 
but in one place there occurs a curiously awkward 
attempt to represent the abbreviated corruption of 
" without," which of course should be " 'thout," and 
not " 'thought," as we find it printed. 

That Oscar Wilde's poems should be included in so 
popular and standard a series as the " Astor Poets " 
(Crowell) is emphatic proof of the secure place that he 
now occupies in literature. The edition is evidently 
complete, including as it does the " Uncollected Poems " 
first published in the complete English edition de luxe, 
and the exquisite "poems in prose." Mr. Nathan Has- 
kell Dole contributes a biographical introduction which, 
good as it is, would be still better if it were half as long. 
It seems to us a pity to perpetuate in such a place as 
this so many of the more or less apocryphal anecdotes 
of Wilde's foibles and extravagances. It is his greatness, 
rather than his littleness, that should be emphasized. 
The low price at which the volume is issued, together 
with its attractive and careful typography, should make 
this a favorite edition. 

The discriminating few who have found delight in 
that exquisite bit of writing, " The Roadmender," will 
be glad to learn something of its author in the little 
volume entitled "Michael Fairless: Her Life and Writ- 
ings " (Button-). Under the pseudonym of "Michael 
Fairless " was concealed the gentle personality of Miss 
Margaret Fairless Barber, a gifted Englishwoman who 
died at thirty-two after several years of acute physical 
suffering. " The Roadmender " was written during 
her last months, as were also her two other books 
" The Gathering of Brother Hilarius " and " The Gray 
Brethren." In the volume now published, her sister, 
Mrs. Haggard, supplies a slender biographical chapter; 
while her literary executor, Mrs. Dowson, contributes 
the critical portion. Two portraits of " Michael Fair- 
less " add to the interest of this record of a rarely gifted 
personality. 

In the guise of a fable or folk-tale of ingenious con- 
struction, Mr. C. H. Robinson relates the history of the 
part supposed to have been played by fire in the raising 
of primitive man from his lowest level to one appre- 
ciably higher. " Longhead : The Story of the First 
Fire " (Page) traces the fortunes of the observant and 
inventive hero, the dolichocephalous Longhead, and his 
somewhat similarly gifted spouse, Broken Tooth, after 
his accidental discovery, in which a fortunate stroke of 
lightning plays a prominent part, of the singular nature 
of fire and some of its useful properties. How the dis- 
covery leads eventually to the rudimentary beginnings 
of domestic and social life, of cooperation, the useful 
arts, government, and even religion, is agreeably pic- 
tured, with some forcing of the motive or underlying 
thought, perhaps, but with no detriment to the interest 
of the tale. The author's use of " brachiocephalic " 
("arm-headed," if it means anything) instead of 
" brachycephalic," as the antonym of " dolichocephalic " 
or "dolichocephalous," is a little surprising; and in this 
connection one might question whether there were any 
long-skulled men among those most nearly brutal an- 
cestors of ours of whom Longhead is supposed to have 
been one. But the story is a good and instructive piece 
of imaginative anthropology for the young, and its 
illustrations by Mr. Charles Livingston Bull are in 
harmony with the text. 



NOTES. 



" To-day and Yesterday in New Rochelle," by Dr. 
J. Pettit Gaylord, is soon to be issued in an illustrated 
volume by William R. Jenkins Co. 

Mr. J. E. Patterson, the English author of sea stories 
and poems, has a new novel entitled " His Father's 
Wife " nearly ready for publication. 

"Anthony Trollope: His Work, Associates, and 
Originals," by Mr. T. H. S. Escott, is an interesting 
biographical announcement of the John Lane Co. 

A volume of " Last Poems," by the late Julia C. R. 
Dorr, made up of recent magazine contributions and some 
unpublished work, is announced by Messrs. Scribner. 

Two novels just added to Messrs. Putnam's autumn 
list are " Wanderfoot " by Miss Cynthia Stockley, and 
" The Lure of the Little Drum " by Miss Margaret 
Peterson. 

" The Story of Waitstill Baxter," Mrs. Kate Douglas 
Wiggin's forthcoming novel, will have for its back- 
ground the Maine village so familiar to readers of 
" Rebecca." 

The much-extolled series of historical dramas entitled 
" The Renaissance " by Arthur Count Gobineau will be 
published during the autumn by Messrs. Putnam in a 
volume edited by Mr. Oscar Levy. 

Mr. Archibald Henderson's forthcoming volume, 
" European Dramatists," will consider the work of six 
representative playwrights Ibsen, Strindberg, Oscar 
Wilde, M. Maeterlinck, Mr. Bernard Shaw, and Mr. 
Granville Barker. 

Mr. H.G.Wells's forthcoming novel, " The Passionate 
Friends," recounts the love affairs of one Stephen Strat- 
ton, and is supposed to be written by him with the object 
of assisting a son to avoid dangers similar to those which 
he has experienced. 

Miss Marjorie Patterson, author of the just-published 
theatrical novel entitled " The Dust of the Road," is a 
young American girl of considerable stage experience 
gained chiefly as a member of Mr. Benson's English 
Shakespearean company. 

Mr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson's "My Life with the 
Eskimo " is scheduled for publication in October. The 
book is said to be a fascinating record of description 
and adventure, and at the same time a contribution of 
importance to scientific literature. 

The " novel of the season " for many readers will be 
Mr. Galsworthy's " The Dark Flower," which Messrs. 
Scribner plan to issue this month. To those who have 
followed its serial publication, it has seemed much the 
strongest work yet put forth by this writer. 

A volume of collected verse by Mr. Brian Hooker 
appears on the autumn list of the Yale University 
Press. Mr. Hooker wrote the opera " Mona," which, 
set to music by Professor Horatio W. Parker, won the 
Metropolitan Opera Company's prize in 1911 for the 
best opera written in English by an American. 

The first volume of "A History of England," by 
Professor Edward P. Cheney, is nearly ready. There 
are to be two volumes of this work, covering the period 
from the defeat of the Armada to the death of Elizabeth, 
and containing an account of English institutions during 
the later sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries. 

The autumn announcement list of The Open Court 
Publishing Co. includes the following: "The History 
of Japanese Mathematics," by Dr. David Eugene Smith 



1913] 



THE DIAL

and Professor Yoshio Mikami ; " The Cabala : Its In- 
fluence on Judaism and Christianity," and " Jesus in the 
Talmud," by Mr. Bernhard Pick; "The Philosophy of 
Nietzsche," " The Principle of Mechauicalism," and 
" The Principle of Relativity," all by Dr. Paul Carus. 

" Unvisited Places of Old Europe," an illustrated 
travel book by Mr. Robert Shackleton, is announced 
for early issue by the Penn Publishing Co. To their 
series of " Popular Handbooks " the same publishers 
will soon add two new titles " English Writers " by 
Mr. R. V. Gilbert, and " Stories of the Operas " by 
Miss Ethel Shubert. 

The " Seven Seas " edition of Mr. Rudyard Kipling's 
complete works is announced by Messrs. Doubleday, 
Page & Co., in twenty-three handsomely-printed vol- 
umes. Some new material, including " Letters to the 
Family," etc., will appear here for the first time. The 
edition is limited to 1050 sets, each of which will be 
signed by the author. 

An elaborate and important " Encyclopaedia of the 
Philosophical Sciences " is being projected by the Mac- 
millan Co. The work is edited by Professor Wilhelm 
Windelband, Dr. Arnold Ruge, and Sir Henry Jones. 
The articles are written by some of the most eminent 
philosophical thinkers of the day. A first volume on 
Logic, to appear this month, contains contributions by 
Arnold Ruge, Wilhelm Windelband, Josiah Royce, and 
various other philosophical scholars, both European and 
American. 

By the death of Alphonso Gerald Newcomer, which 
occurred at Stanford University on September 15, there 
is lost to American scholarship a prominent and honor- 
able name and to THE DIAL one of its ablest and most 
valued contributors. Professor Newcomer was born in 
1864, and after being educated at Michigan and Cornell 
was for two or three years instructor at Knox College. 
For the past twenty-two years, however, he has been 
associated with the English department of Stanford, 
occupying the chair of English since 1906. His pub- 
lished books include the following : " Practical Course 
in English Composition"; "Elements of Rhetoric"; 
" Selections from Landor " (edited) ; " American Liter- 
ature"; "Rhetoric in Practice" (with S. S. Seward, 
Jr.) ; " English Literature "; and " Twelve Centuries of 
English Poetry and Prose " (with Alice E. Andrews). 
Professor Newcomer's last contribution to THE DIAL 
was a review of Mr. Frank Harris's " The Women of 
Shakespeare," published in our issue of March 16 last.

FAMILIAR SPANISH TRAVELS 

By WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 

TN this new book of travels Mr. Howells relates the incidents and 
impressions of his trip through Spain. In a leisurely, discursive 
fashion he notes what most appealed to him as he journeyed from 
San Sebastian through Burgos, Madrid, Toledo, Cordova, Seville to 
Granada, Ronda, Algecirus, and Tarifa. Like a glorified kinama- 
color film, he passes in review Spanish scenery, the architecture of 
cathedrals and palaces ; theatres and hotels ; picturesque street 
scenes, Moorish remains; the King and Queen; beggars and guides; gipsies and 
donkeys. And back of all this living present, adding richness to the scene like a 
figured tapestry, is the romantic history of Spain's past.

THE MASTERS OF 
MODERN FRENCH CRITICISM 

By Irving Babbitt 

A survey of the intellectual life of France 
during the nineteenth century. " Un livre 
exceptionnellement remarquable . . . tresdocte, 
infiniment agreable, debordant d'idees, dont 
beaucoup sont frappantes de justesse." 

Augustin Filon in Le Journal des Debats. 

" One of those rare books in which the value 
of sound fundamental distinctions, thought 
out to their ultimate implications, makes itself 
felt on every page, while logical severity, far 
from resulting in dry dogmatism, lends itself 
to the play of wit and aesthetic perceptiveness." 
North American Review. 

" The most extensive and profound study 
of the subject in existence. As such it will be 
indispensable to serious students, while its 
spirited style, broad point of view, and sugges- 
tive analysis of nineteenth century literature 
will render it attractive and helpful to the 
general reader." Modern Language Notes.

At a time when the literary market is glutted with sex discussions, reformers' 
propaganda and intimate self " revelations," a story like THE TASTE OF 
APPLES comes as a pure, clean breath of country air to waft away the

NEALE'S FOR OCTOBER 

Besides the regular departments, The Fraternity of the Fields, which is intended to be the 
eyes and ears of him who may not be with Nature in her many moods, conducted by an eminent writer; 
The Stage, a department of brilliant, trenchant, fearless criticism of plays, actors, and drama 1 ists, 
conducted by a distinguished critic; Letters to the Editors, in which correspondents discuss among 
themselves topics of interest; In Motley, a department of wit and humor, not mere jokes, but pointedness, 
directed chiefly at persons in the limelight; Editorial Comments, in which all sorts of subjects will be 
treated, now seriously, now lightly, yet always vigorously, fearlessly, and independently, besides these 
regular departments and the serials now running, the October number, among many interesting features, 
contains noteworthy contributions to general literature as follows: 

THE WALLS OF CONCARNEAU By George K. Baker 

The first instalment of this novel, which will run serially for twelve months, was published in the 
September number. Broidered on the historical fabric of the struggle of the devoted Bretons, who in 
1489 held Brittany against the French for the young Duchess Anne, this story keeps the reader alert, with 
eyes wide and ears open, and the close, wild warfare of the 15th century, with all its clash of arms and clank 
of mail, rings from the pages, and sweeps the reader on as with the resistless rush of the ocean. The editors 
of this magazine confidently affirm that America possesses no greater writer of fiction than George K. Baker. 

BROKEN LIGHTS By Mowry Saben 

As an essayist Mr. Saben is unexcelled by any American writer. He is to a degree Arthur Symons, 
Walter Pater, George Moore, and, perhaps, George Bernard Shaw, Americanized, or, shall we say, 
cosmopolitan]' zed. He first attracted attention by his essays that were published in the Boston Transcript. 
These were followed by such important books as "The Spirit of Life" and "The Twilight of the Gods." 
The first of the essays assembled under the general title of "Broken Lights" was published in NEALE'S 
MONTHLY for September and the others will follow serially. The titles of the various papers are : " Some 
Modern Ways of Thinking," "A Criticism of Some Modern Ways of Thinking," "Puritanism," "The 
Right to Freedom," ''Self-Realization," and "Life Considered as a Fine Art." 

BRILLA By Anna M. Doling 

This unique and irresistible serial, the story of a lie, began in NEALE'S MONTHLY for September. 
A region yet unexplored in literature, the Ozark Mountains, forms a picturesque background for the 
figures that move through this striking American novel. Seldom is it the good fortune of a reader to 
find an absorbingly interesting story written at once so simply and so well yet so compellingly. 

OUR JUNGLE MAN The first of this Series of noteworthy articles is published in NEALE'S MONTHLY 
for October. Jn the Series the relations of the white man and the black as they exist throughout the United 
States, but more particularly in the Southern States, will be discussed with the utmost freedom by prominent 
members of both the Caucasian and the Negro races. The first article of the Series, "Out of the House of 
Bondage," is by Kelly Miller, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Howard University, perhaps the 
ablest writer of the Negro race. The second article, " Crawling Under Racial Barriers," is by Berrian Bev- 
erley, a Southern educator of note, a brilliant writer, and familiar with Negro life in all its aspects. The 
third article, "My Neighbor and Myself," is by John R. Lynch, said by the late Senator George F. Hoar to 
be the ablest of the colored men who served with him in Congress, Temporary Chairman of the Republican 
National Convention of 1884, formerly Fourth Auditor of the Treasury, the author of "The Facts of 
Reconstruction " and of other books. The fourth article, " Race Orthodoxy in the South," is by Thomas 
Pearce Bailey, a Southern writer on sociological subjects, who has held professorships in universities as 
follows, California, Chicago, and Mississippi, and who is now engaged in educational work in the South. 
Be sure to begin your subscription with the October number, and thus get this Series complete. 

INTO THE SUNSET By Edward S. Van Zile 

The first instalment of this novel was published in the August number of NEALE'S MONTHLY. The 
story which is full of the stir of life, the clash of swords, the roll of the sea, and "whisperings of love" 
tells of the romantic career of the first Irishman to reach the New World. He came with Columbus, 
and so did another young man, and so did two girls. Mr. Van Zile is the author of several successful 
novels, the most widely read of which, perhaps, is "With Sword and Crucifix," which won for him a 
doctor's degree in literature from Trinity College. 

Short fiction and various timely and interesting articles, besides the features enumerated above, will 
make NEALR'S MONTHLY for October noteworthy among American magazines. 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every number contains more 
than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain less than 128 pages. In its mechanical appoint- 
ments no magazine in existence is its superior.

ALL FOR $15 
Neale's Monthly for One Year 

and the 

Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce 

NOW COMPLETE IN TWELVE MASSIVE OCTAVO VOLUMES 

ONLY 400 sets of the first large edition of "The Collected Works of Ambrose 
Bierce" are left. Of this first edition "The Saturday Re view," London, said: 
"The binding and printing are perfect, recalling the best productions of Colburn 
and Blvingtons at the beginning of the last century." Indeed, in all the annals 
of bookmaking the first edition of "The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce" has 
never been surpassed mechanically by any other publication. The paper, specially 
made for this first edition, is of the highest quality; the type is Caslon, new, pica, 
double-leaded ; the presswork is of the best. In every respect this edition is worthy 
the great writer whose life-work in literature it presents to the world. 

So great a bargain in books of pure literature has never been offered before. 

These 400 sets are exactly like the "Autograph Edition," except they are not 
signed by the author, and they are bound in decorated cloth instead of in full 
morocco. They are a part of the first printing. No set of the "Autograph Edition," 
bound from these sheets, has been sold at less than $120, its price, and no set will 
ever be sold at less. 

There are, approximately, 100,000 words to the volume, or 1,200,000 words to 
the 12 volumes, the dimensions of which are about 6 inches wide, 9 inches long, and 
2 inches thick, and average more than 400 pages each. 

The man does not live, from the humblest in rank to the most exalted, from 
the most illiterate to the most erudite, who would not read time and again every line 
that Ambrose Bierce has written. 

Persons who wish to give as Christmas presents the magazine to one person and 
"The Collected Works" to another may enter their subscriptions accordingly, and 
both " Neale's Monthly " and " The Collected Works " will be held by the publishers 
on request for Christmas delivery on all subscriptions entered and paid for now. 

Public libraries should take advantage of this exceptional offer while they can.

A FAMOUS VICTORY. 

The enactment of the new tariff law, which 
went into effect on an early day in the present 
month, may fairly be described as a famous 
victory a victory for the forces that are assail- 
ing the citadel of corruption and special privi- 
lege. Even little Peterkin could be made to 
understand the reasons why it deserves this 
title. We can share to the full in the exultation 
felt by President Wilson in the solemn moment 
when he affixed his signature to the act, saying, 
as he did so: 

"I feel a peculiar pleasure in what I have just done by 
way of taking part in the completion of a great piece of 
business. It is a pleasure which is hard to express in words 
which are adequate to express the feeling; because the 
feeling that I have is that we have done the rank and 
file of the people of this country a great service. I have 
a feeling of profound gratitude that, working with the 
splendid men who have carried this thing through with 
studious attention and doing justice all around, I should 
have had part in serving the people of this country as 
we have been striving to serve them ever since I can 
remember." 

It is, indeed, " a great piece of business " to have 
dealt such a body blow to the intrenched inter- 
ests that have so long set the common welfare 
at defiance, and, with the rancid patriotism and 
nauseous hypocrisy of their defence of an inde- 
fensible system, have for so long made the worse 
appear the better reason to the muddled public 
intelligence. Of a truth, the plea for protec- 
tionism is revolting to the trained mind, and the 
shifts to which its advocates have been reduced 
in recent years have provided a startling object- 
lesson of the tenacity of irrationalism. There 
never were but two arguments in its favor hav- 
ing about them a shred of logical respectability 
the infant industry argument, and the argu- 
ment that a country should be self-sustaining in 
the necessaries of existence and both of these 
have been so ludicrously inapplicable to our 
practice of protectionism during the last half- 
century that its hardened defenders have been 
almost ashamed to use them. Instead of them, 
we have had the pauper labor argument, and the 
bread line argument, and the dumping argument, 
and the cheap man argument, and the foreigner- 
pays-the-tax argument, all of them so ineffably 
silly that they have strained the enormous capa- 
city of the ordinary mind to be humbugged. 
Now, at least, the air is partly cleared, and 



292 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



a large share of the ill-gotten gains which the 
beneficiaries of the old vicious system have been 
pocketing under the sanction of law has been 
turned back into the channels of competitive 
industry, and the injured fill our ears with 
dismal prophesyings. But we must not forget, 
in all our satisfaction about what has been 
accomplished, that the victory is by no means 
complete, and must be regarded as only a first 
step although a long one toward the desired 
goal. The new tariff law is still a highly pro- 
tective measure, and its schedules contain many 
duties that our daughters of the horse-leech in 
the days before the Civil War would have re- 
garded as higher than there was any use in 
demanding. A tariff law that continues to tax 
any foreign products (except luxuries) fifty 
per cent and upwards is by no means a matter 
for unqualified self-congratulation on the part 
of the consumer, who may still indignantly ask: 
" Why should the law force me to buy from the 
domestic producer something which I want, and 
pay him this enormous tribute, when it is offered 
me elsewhere at a reasonable price?" The 
question is insistent, and will not down ; it is a 
question quite as pertinent under the new law as 
it was under the outrageous provisions of the old 
one. All we have thus far done has been to 
make a sort of compromise between the social- 
istic policy of protectionism and the policy of 
taxation which takes into account only the 
principles of equitable incidence and adequate 
revenue, and between these policies a lasting 
compromise is no more possible than between 
darkness and light, or between evil and good. 

There are certain tariff matters with which 
a journal like ours is especially concerned which 
loom much larger in the consciousness than their 
political or financial importance would warrant. 
As citizens of the republic, we are concerned 
with such things as the cotton and woollen and 
lumber schedules; as conductors of a journal 
having for its special field the interests of culture, 
we are much more largely concerned with such 
matters as the tariff on books and works of art, 
and with the provisions that affect the comfort 
of returning travellers. We have called the 
tariff on books the meanest of taxes, and we 
deeply regret that it will continue to retard the 
progress of education and culture. The Presi- 
dent cannot be held guiltless of the perpetuation 
of this enormity, for no one can doubt that the 
firmness which he displayed in his demand for 
free wool and free sugar could have obtained 
for us free books without the least difficulty. 
And there is a sense in which free books are, 



more important than either free wool or free 
sugar. That they are withheld is a fact that 
has about it a shameful and humiliating quality 
that does not attach to an unjustifiable tax upon 
a merely commercial product. If a President 
who stands for scholarship more distinctly than 
any we have had since the early Virginian dy- 
nasty can fail us so lamentably, the case seems 
indeed hopeless. It is true that, after an ener- 
getic protest, the indecent attempt to take books 
in foreign languages from the free list has been 
abandoned, that English Bibles and text- books 
are now admitted free, and that the tax on En- 
glish books in general has been reduced from 
twenty-five to fifteen per cent, but these are only 
palliations of a grievous offence. A tax of one 
per cent upon them would be almost as obnox- 
ious as the higher one now in force, because any 
tax at all means that an English book cannot 
be sent to an American scholar by post without 
being held up at the custom-house, and this fact, 
far rather than the increased price, is the head and 
front of the offending. As for books imported 
by booksellers, the lowered tax means a possible 
lowering of the price by two cents in the shilling, 
and we may be fairly sure that the individual 
purchaser will not get even that small benefit. 

The victory of the forces that have been de- 
manding untaxed works of art is indeed a no- 
table one. The opposition to this enlightened 
measure was of so unreasoning and pigheaded 
a description that it seemed hopeless to seek to 
overcome it. But the hopeless was accom- 
plished, thanks to the strong concerted attack 
made upon this proposed monstrosity of taxa- 
tion. At the risk of seeming to be engaged in 
the unnecessary task of slaying the slain, we 
will make the following quotations from the 
brief of Mr. John Quinn, acting as counsel for 
the American artists in their demand not to be 
protected by an over-zealous government : 

" The art of every age is the flowering of all the sci- 
entific and all the philosophic thought of its own day 
and time. It quickens vitality and intensifies the love 
of beauty and increases the joy of life. The plea that 
I make for free contemporary fine art is a plea that art 
may be brought within the reach of people of modest 
means and not remain the trading commodity of 
wealthy art-dealers or become merely the hobby or the 
exclusive possession of the rich." 

" As was pointed out in my brief, we are the only or 
substantially the only civilized country that taxes art. 
We spend hundreds of thousands and even millions on 
museums, art galleries, art commissions, municipal, 
state and national, and yet the Finance Committee of 
the Senate proposes to erect a Chinese wall fifty feet 
high against the importation of modern, vital, living, 
creative art." 

" It is an absurdity to argue that art is merely a 



1913] 



293 



luxury. It is a degradation to treat it as though it 
were something like opium or a drug or an adulterated 
food or like a contagious disease, and it is uncivilized 
and reactionary to consider it merely as a means of 
raising a little revenue, as if it were leather or wool or 
machinery or tobacco or bananas or cotton goods or 
like any other articles of utility that need ' protection ' 
or afford a chance to raise a little revenue from." 

Even our benighted senatorial law-makers had 
to yield to such persuasions as these, and with 
respect to our national attitude toward art we 
may now at last be reckoned among the civil- 
ized countries. But we still belong with the 
barbarians in the matter of books, and in the 
matter of those tariff provisions which now 
make the return from abroad a terror to every 
American traveller. No American who has 
ever learned by personal experience the contrast 
between the treatment of the tourist in Euro- 
pean and American custom-houses has not 
blushed for his country ; and if the numbers of 
such returning tourists were o^y large enough, 
we should not long have to endure an admin- 
istrative system which regards every one of 
them as an object of suspicion, and which re- 
quires, in addition to a personal declaration of 
innocence, an inquisitive investigation to deter- 
mine the truth of that declaration. 



THE AUTHOR OFEREWHON." 

Is there any certain recipe for contemporary 
reputation? Catching on to coat-tails is as good a 
counsel as any. It is as valuable for the catchee as 
for the catcher; for if enough people of parts can 
be induced to form a train, their light, singly perhaps 
indiscernable, may together flare out in our sky like 
a comet which "fires the length of Ophiuchus huge." 
Such a combination of brillancies is not only pardon- 
able but laudable. Meier-Graef e said that the Pre- 
Raphaelite movement in England was a criminal 
conspiracy. But this is shooting way beyond the 
mark. Natural sympathy caused the members of the 
group to gravitate together, and they did a needed 
work. Only, for awhile, their preoccupation with 
themselves, the flood of books and articles which 
they poured forth about each other, threw everything 
else in England into obscurity. The movement was 
not really the central fact of the time, but it had the 
appearance of being so; and other great names or 
great issues were eclipsed. 

The pioneers, the originators among men, have, 
however, usually a solitary lot. Luck, or just hitting 
the right moment, may sometimes get them an imme- 
diate following; but more often theirs is a lonely 
fight with the world. Like Winkelried, they must 
gather the spears of the Philistines into their breasts 
in order to make a way for the Children of Light. 
And too often those who follow them into the breach 



are pseudo Children of Light, Children of Light 
for revenue only, who give an additional stab to the 
leader who has made their victory possible. 

But when such a leader is comfortably dead, then 
his struggle and his obscurity are at an end. He is 
treasure trove for the whole world. A few explorers 
discover him at first, and they bring back and exhibit 
the nuggets of rich ore in which his work abounded. 
Then there is a Klondike rush to his "diggings," 
as there was not long ago to Nietzsche. 

The recently published "Note Books" of Samuel 
Butler show plainly enough that their writer died 
in the modest assurance that he was of this order of 
men, and would, intellectually, " cut up rich." This 
interesting miscellany of fragments, notes, diaries, 
essays, bears a striking resemblance to the "Parerga" 
of Schopenhauer. There is the same solitary attitude 
of disdain for his contemporaries, and very much 
the same views of life, death, genius, and greatness. 
Unfortunately, Schopenhauer came first, and the 
massy brilliancy of his prose is beyond anything the 
Englishman has achieved. " Can you emit sparks ? " 
is the first question we ask of a writer of this kind. 
Unquestionably Butler can and does emit sparks; 
but compared with the broad, vigorous flashes of 
Schopenhauer, they are small and dim. His ideas 
resemble the older man's as the second infusion of 
tea-leaves in the pot resembles the first brew. Or his 
mind might be compared to a sieve into which all 
the thoughts of his great contemporaries in science 
and philosophy have been poured: the lesser thoughts 
get through and into his books, but the larger ones 
remain behind unused. We may adopt what attitude 
we please towards Schopenhauer and Nietzsche : we 
may call the first the Apostle of Gloom and the sec- 
ond the Prophet of Unrighteousness; but the fact 
remains that they startle, astound, and wake us up. 
They are capable of giving the world those electric 
shocks that resurrect it. Butler's battery of magnetic 
truths is only a respectable one, and we think that 
in England alone there are several of his contem- 
poraries who surpass him in novelty and force of 
opinion. In science his study of heredity and habit 
may have more originality than we can see in it when 
considered along with the investigations of Darwin, 
Galton, and Von Hartmann; but it is certainly not 
epoch-making. 

Butler indulged himself in a number of opinions 
which can hardly be called anything but crochets. 
One of these was that the English school of music is 
the finest in the world, and that Handel is not only 
the greatest of all musicians, but the greatest man 
who has ever worked in any of the arts. That is a 
question of taste ; and if a person chooses to have a 
taste of that kind there is nothing more to say ex- 
cept that he is not likely to be of a prevailing party. 
Another of his crochets was that the Odyssey was 
written by a woman. That is a question of fact; 
and as there are no facts adducible to prove it, and 
all tradition and the acceptance of ages being against 
it, the theory must be waved aside. 

Again and again, in his " Note Books " and else-

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



where, Butler shows himself sensitive to the charge 
of being a man of one hook. "Erewhon" was the 
one success of his career, and it came early. That 
he could have repeated this success and won contem- 
porary literary fame is probable ; but he branched off 
into painting, music, and other kinds of achievement. 
Towards the end of his life he essayed the modern 
novel of manners in " The Way of All Flesh." This, 
however, was published posthumously, and any vogue 
it may have had came too late to console him. There 
were undoubtedly in his character a lofty indifference 
to practical results and a high disdain of literary 
quackery. But there was also a lack of verve and 
flow and continuity, which explains the scantiness 
of his product and the paucity of his repute. 

Mr. George Bernard Shaw suggests that "The 
Way of All Flesh " is a masterpiece. It is not neces- 
sary to state, therefore, that it belongs to the school 
of fiction which holds up life by the tail, like a strug- 
gling puppy, and not to the school which places life 
on a pedestal for study and admiration. This school 
might be called that of the Dropped Veil, for it prides 
itself on tearing away all illusion from existence. 
As most of the great philosophies of the world main- 
tain that all existence is illusion, this kind of fiction 
cannot have a very sound philosophical basis. Most 
of us hug our illusions, and get enough interest and 
amusement out of life to make us want to live. But 
the new fiction preaches to us that it would have been 
money in our pockets if we had never been born. 
It is not that it deals with more forbidden material 
than the older fiction, with worse vices and crimes, 
with more terrible outlooks upon time and eternity. 
That would be an impossible feat, for all the secrets 
of evil have long been embodied in immortal verse 
and prose. But the new fiction goes about its work 
of being bad in a hard didactic way, which, though 
it convinces us that the Devil is dull and Evil is only 
another word for ennui, makes its novels and plays 
as repulsive as tracts, and kills all joy in us. The 
joy of festival and the joy of battle, the delight of 
the senses and the heroism of the soul, these surely 
are the things that literature should convey to us 
and convince us of. 

With the best will in the world to be what they 
call brutally true, the new fictionists are continually 
having to make concessions to romanticism. The 
whole plot of "The Way of All Flesh" is an instance 
of this. It bears a distant resemblance to the plot 
of " Wilhelm Meister." In both books the hero 
is set loose to flounder about in the world, get into 
bad company, and fall into evil ways. In " Wilhelm 
Meister " there is a certain College of Guardians 
which watches and directs Wilhelm's course unknown 
to him, and only lets him out as it were on a leash. 
In Butler's book this business is assumed by an 
older relative, who holds a large fortune secretly in 
trust for the hero, and who steers him through his 
misadventures. Of course this is playing the game 
of realism with loaded dice. It is making Achilles 
invulnerable, and then patting him on the back for 
being brave. 



Butler's hard, tight style prevents his portraits 
from having much literary lure ; but in one char- 
acter, a reincarnation of Mrs. Quickly, he nearly 
arrives at a creation. The girl Ellen is painted in 
hard, bright colors ; but as we have spoken of 
" Wilhelm Meister " we may compare her with 
Philina, in order to see how charm and mystery and 
illusion are needed to make anything that is living. 
Mr. Pontifex, the hero's father, is almost the raison 
d'etre of the book ; but he bores us as much as he 
did his son. As a clergyman he is not as prepos- 
terous as Mr. Collins; as a father he is not more 
erring than Mr. Bennet ; but whereas custom can- 
not stale the infinite variety of Jane Austen's men, 
we have not the patience to read Mr. Pontifex's 
record through. 

So, in the end, to explain Butler's confidence in 
his immortality, and the importance his disciples 
seem to attach to him, we are driven back to the 
book which the world did in some measure accept. 
The central idea of " Erewhon," that of a country 
where human nature runs on different lines than it 
does with us, is of course as old as literature. It 
appears in Aristophanes, Lucian, the " Arabian 
Nights," Sir Thomas More, Lord Bacon, Swift. 
John Buncle, and many others, down to recent times 
when the theme has become almost as prolific in its 
varied inventions as that other but somewhat similar 
one of an imaginary European kingdom. The mould 
has always been the same, but it has been filled up 
with different material. Sometimes it has been 
purely idealistic, sometimes fantastic, sometimes 
satirical. " Erewhon " combines all three of these 
elements. We are inclined to think that its ideal- 
ism, its doctrine of the simple life and a return to 
nature, rather conflicts with its satire. The end of 
the book has forgotten its beginning. 

It will probably be granted that Swift's " Gul- 
liver's Travels " is the central and best book in this 
type of literature. "Erewhon," we should say, can 
fairly claim second place. Written fifty years ago, 
its satire is not only fresh and effective, but it deals 
with problems and ideas which are only now begin- 
ning to stir in the world's mind. There is a curious 
mixture in the book of ironical satire on modern 
civilization and a suggested new philosophy of life. 
The Erewhonian notions about health and crime 
have not been put into practice by any society the 
world has known, though they may be in a meas- 
ure anticipatory of the Nietzschean programme. 
But Butler's satire on our double standard of Chris- 
tian and commercial morality, in his description of 
the " Musical Banks "; his exposure of our higher 
education in the account of the Colleges of Unrea- 
son, with their " hypothetical " language ; his rev- 
elations about the mythological figures which the 
Erewhonians worshipped but did not believe in ; 
and his approving comment on Goddess Ydgruri, 
whom we take to mean Good Sense or Good Form, 
all these inventions are deadly thrusts at civilization 
as it exists to-day. 

But the most important thing in the book is the 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



295 



theory as to the danger of machinery. While 
Butler was in New Zealand he wrote and published 
there an essay entitled " Darwin among the Ma- 
chines," and this became the germ of " Erewhon." 
Briefly, the theory is that machines tend to become 
a super-race which will in time enslave and crush 
out the men who make them. The Erewhonians 
are convinced of this, and destroy all their up-to-date 
machinery. We think that Swift would have dem- 
onstrated the horror of these Frankenstein monsters 
in a more concrete way than Butler has done ; but 
the latter is to be credited with foreseeing a long 
time ago a very real danger which threatens hu- 
manity. Machines may never acquire mind and 
volition, as he suggests they will, but without that 
they can come near to ruining humanity. 

On the whole, we must take leave of Samuel 
Butler with assurances of distinguished respect. 
He was perhaps too much of a scientist to be a 
great philosopher, and too much of a dilettante to 
be a great scientist, but as a satirist he has hit the 
blot again and again. The grim irony with which 
the hero of u Erewhon " is made to tell his project 
for capturing anl selling into slavery his kindly 
Erewhonian hosts, in order that they may be con- 
verted to Christianity, is worthy of Swift himself. 
CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

GENIUS IN THE TREADMILL is always a pathetic 
spectacle, however beneficial it may ultimately prove 
to soaring genius to be forcibly held down to earth 
for a certain disciplinary period. In the letters 
(reviewed on another page) of him who, as Mr. 
Gilder expressed it in his fine tribute to the poet, 
gave us "the thrill of a brave new song" and "lovely 
thoughts and mighty thoughts and thoughts that 
linger long," we have frequent glimpses of the song- 
ster fretting at the necessity that holds him a bond- 
slave in the "Chicago themery " this, of course, re- 
fers to his instructorship in English at the University 
of Chicago when he longs to go "galumphing o'er 
twin-peaked Parnassus." A few passages from the 
letters will fill in this picture of William Vaughn 
Moody beating, with not quite impotent hands, the 
bars of his prison cell. He did gain his freedom after 
some years of drudgery, but meanwhile he eased 
the tension by many a half-serious, half-humorous, 
and always amusingly extravagant outburst like the 
following: "If my lines were cast in other places, 
even other places in this gigantic ink-blot of a town 
I could make shift to enjoy my breath. I should 
make a very happy and efficient peanut-vender on 
Clark or Randolph Street, because the rush and noise 
of the blood in the city's pulse would continually 
solicit and engage me. The life of a motor-man is 
not without exhilarating and even romantic features, 
and an imaginative boot-black is lord of unskirted 
realms." Again, referring to some vacation hack- 
writing, he says : " Promptly at 9 o'clock each morn- 



ing I put on blinders, stuff my ears with wax, and 
strap myself to the desk, in order to do my day's 
stint on a text-book on English Literature (God save 
the mark ! ) which I have to get a certain portion of 
done this month." A later letter shows the writer 
once more at his post. " It has been the very devil 
to get down to work again, after my long and keenly- 
relished holiday. Chicago seemed uglier and grim- 
mer than I had believed possible. There was nothing 
to do but shut my eyes, put my sensibilities in the 
lower drawer, and sail in. Gradually the beneficent 
numbness of drudgery is stealing over me, and that 
tin illuminated dogged patience which constitutes my 
substitute for moral courage is beginning to possess 
what in other seasons I am wont to refer to exuber- 
antly as my soul." Moody was never lacking in 
"sand" (a favorite term of his), and moreover he 
was supported by an underlying sense of the essential 
fairness of the fates in their dealings with him, as 
witness the following: "Chicago is several kinds of 
hell, but I won't weary you with asseverations that 
I am being shamefully victimized by fate ; you wont 
believe it, and besides it 's a lie. I am merely paying 
the market rates for my bread and beer, commodities 
for which many a better man has been villainously 
overcharged." ... 

LINGUISTIC VANDALISM works its ravages in every 
age and clime, asserts the sagely observant author 
of "New Letters of an Idle Man" (noticed more 
particularly in another column). A paragraph from 
a letter of his written in 1885 is even more timely 
now than it was then. He writes : " I was amazed 
by the extracts from your German friend's letter; 
and besides, they were interesting as showing how 
prone is the human mind in all countries to the same 
kind of idiocies in regard to spelling and that kind 
of thing, although at present there is doubtless less 
Blodsinn on the whole in Germany than among us 
Americans, who in regard to the English language 
seem to me obstinately bent upon improving it the 
wrong way. Let us add what we will to the lan- 
guage, but let us not change it: for no good can 
come of change: nay, rather much harm: for do we 
not thus lose connection with the Past? and all our 
magnificent Earlier Literature is swept into the 
limbo of Gibberish, the limbo I mean like unto 
that in which Chaucer doth languish. By all means 
take up this topic in your next Monthly Lecture. 
The topic is of ethical import. It connects itself 
with the sanctity of Inherited Good, and the vast 
moral blessing of having conscious root in the Past. 
It is only gorillas that devour their own offspring, 
only savages that pass away without leaving trace 
of their existence. Deepening and preserving race- 
consciousness, so to speak, is of ethical import. The 
more civilized is a race, the more it will keep in its 
consciousness the whole sweep of its Past. To pre- 
serve the language is to preserve this sweep of the 
Past. What good does it do to write scepter instead 
of sceptre? go on in this way and a book two hun- 
dred years old is a strange thing to us; keep on 
writing sceptre and we keep on being conscious of

possessing the whole Past of our Literature as an 
integral and familiar possession." That was uttered 
two decades before the bursting of the storm now 
venting its fury impotently, let us hope on our 
written speech. One can imagine how much more 
vehemently the writer would express himself on the 
same subject to-day. 

Two VIEWS OF PLATO, strikingly opposite, 
chanced to present themselves in two notable books 
that were recently taken up for recreation and re- 
freshment, and they well illustrate in how great a 
measure the subjective element enters into all ap- 
praisal of books and authors. In Professor Oscar 
Kuhns's " Story of my Intellectual Life " (the sub- 
title and the more accurately descriptive title of his 
''One-Sided Autobiography"), memorable among 
the books of the year, he says, in comparing Emer- 
son and Plato: "Similar to this feeling of intense 
delight which I have found in Emerson is my expe- 
rience with Plato, only in a far deeper sense; for 
the faults of Emerson loose connection, staccato 
style, lack of philosophical system are absent from 
the Greek, whose dialogues are as marvellous in re- 
gard to form, wit, gentle humor, and dramatic and 
poetic power, as they are true, deep, far-reaching, 
and fraught, on every page, with a sense of the abid- 
ing and eternal." In contrast with the emphasis 
here laid upon Plato's "form," his freedom from 
"loose connection" and from "lack of philosophical 
system," there must now be cited a passage from 
the second book referred to above, the elaborate 
"Life and Letters of Benjamin Jowett," by Dr. 
Evelyn Abbott and Dr. Lewis Campbell, in which 
it is said of Plato in Jowett's translation that "he 
was brought before us in his strength and his weak- 
ness: the poetry, the imagination, the elevation of 
thought shone out through the English ; and on the 
other hand the sophistry of argument, the uncertainty 
and indefiniteness of the conclusions, the contradic- 
tion of various points of view, were not less appar- 
ent." This is not quite so strong as Mr. Frederic 
Harrison's outspoken verdict, already quoted by us: 
"I care for Plato's metaphysics as little as I care 
for the rhapsodical gammon of Professor Bergson 
or Miss Marie Corelli"; but it certainly conveys a 
different impression of Plato's peculiar merits from 
that gained in reading Professor Kuhns. Luckily, 
however, we can all go directly to Plato himself. 



LIBRARY LKSSONS FOR THE PUBLIC, but without 
entrance examination or graduation certificate, are 
among the possibilities of the future ; yes, even 
among the actualities of the present. In the " Wis- 
consin Library Bulletin" Miss Maud van Buren 
describes certain new and promising " publicity 
methods" that are being tried in various places. 
For instance, ' interest in the new public library of 
St. Louis continues to such an extent, and RO many 
visitors desire to be shown through the building, that 
it has been decided to give special attention to visitors 
on one evening in every month. On that evening 
an effort is made to show the whole building to 



visitors, including parts of it that are not usually 
open to the public, such as the stock room, the cata- 
logue and work rooms, the bindery, etc." Then 
follow some suggestions. " Why not, in the case of 
a new building, attracting many visitors, make these 
special evenings occasions for taking your public into 
your confidence ? The layman knows little of the 
' inner workings ' of a library, and because of his 
ignorance he is likely to undervalue its importance 
and the work of the librarian. Here is an oppor- 
tunity to explain the various processes through which 
a book must go before the patron gets it. The 
arrangement of the books on the shelves, special 
collections, the use of the catalogue, the Reader's 
guide, the clipping and picture collections, and other 
features not on the surface, might have attention 
called to them at this time." This throwing open of 
the penetralia and laying bare of the sacred mys- 
teries would have horrified all librarians a century 
ago and some librarians even a quarter-century ago ; 
but, as has already been remarked by someone else, 
tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis, 



THE FIRST ROLLO BOOK was not, as many might 
suppose, written by Jacob Abbott; it was the product 
of Xenophon's pen, and was called "Cyrojiaedia." 
So we are informed by Mr. Gamaliel Bradford, Jr., 
who writes of the innocent cause of our schoolboy tears 
and groans over th? "Anabasis " in an article entitled 
"A Gentleman of Athens," which appears in the 
October "Yale Review." Rollo was a royal person- 
age in the Greek initial number of the Rollo series. 
His name was Cyrus, and he became King of Persia. 
He had some of the traits of the best New England 
ancestry, and he was always punctual to the second 
with his beautifully appropriate platitudes. Inured 
to the rigors of a rather meagrely-spread board at 
home, whenever he was sent on a visit to his opulent 
grandpa, the King of Media, he was treated to goodies 
without stint by that indulgent old gentleman. But 
in true Rolloesque fashion Cyrus would remark : 
"Grandpa, what a bother your meals must be, if you 
have to reach for all these dishes and taste so many 
kinds of drinks." "What!" exclaims the aston- 
ished grandsire, "don't you find this much better 
than your food at home?" "Oh, no," replies Rollo; 
"the road to repletion is much shorter and easier 
with us than with you. Bread and meat take us 
right where we wish to go, whereas, though you are 
going to the same place, you travel a long way about 
before you get there." What could a royal grandpa 
reply to this ? In such wise, or very nearly, does 
Mr. Bradford introduce us to some pleasant aspects 
of him who has conducted so many unwilling youths 
in that wearisome march up from the sea. 


THE H^GER-BRONTE CORRESPONDENCE, OT the 

four recently unearthed and published letters from 
Charlotte Bronte* to her Brussels teacher, should 
not too hastily be taken to prove " a consuming 
adoration" (the London ' Book Monthly's" words) 
on Miss Bronte's part for Professor He"ger. The

reported willingness of Monsieur He'ger himself 
from the very first to encourage belief in such an 
infatuation has always disinclined the reflective to 
place any confidence in the absurd story ; and Mr. 
Clement K. Snorter's "Charlotte Bronte and Her 
Circle," with its authoritative account of the whole 
affair and its citations from Charlotte Bronte's own 
letters to reinforce his assertions, ought to have 
forever silenced the gossips who found pleasure in 
picturing in a compromising or at least undignified 
attitude the author of ''The Professor," the austere 
young woman who with her youngest sister rushed 
up to London on one memorable occasion to rescue 
her pen name and that of the other brothers " Bell" 
from the imputation of ever so slight a deception 
in the pursuit of their literary calling. Marion 
HaiLn I's short and carefully- written book on Char- 
lotte Bronte' in her Haworth home gives in a few 
words, based on authoritative documents, all that 
one needs to know about the Brussels affair, and if 
anyone is shown in an unSecooring light it is cer- 
tainly not the English literary celebrity whom the 
Belgian schoolmaster was not averse to having ap- 
pear as subjugated by his invincible charms. So, 
at any rate, as the careful an 1 conciliatory Franklin 
would say, it appears to us at present. 



" THE THREE BEST FOODS FOR FANCY," Said Mr. 

Walter R. Nursey, Inspect or of Ontario Public Libra- 
ries, at the late ai nual convention of the Ontario 
Library Association, '-are the spoken story, the 
drama, and the novel. The sanest, the most whole- 
some, the most accessible of these is the novel. It 
is as cruel to deprive a growing boy or budding 
girl of an abundance of wholesome, enjoyable fic- 
tion as it is to debar them from butter on their 
bread. But remember that a child should be taught 
to think of the labor it has cost to produce a book. 
Never to turn down its leaves, never to place it 
upon the table face downward, and never to read 
with dirty or inky fingers." Then followed the 
obvious but always timely truth that "you cannot 
develop heroes and heroines on 'mush.' Many chil- 
dren's books are too puerile in style and too limited 
inla nonage." The fairy tale received high praise, 
perhaps too high praise, from Mr. Nursey, who 
quoted Dr. Felix Adler's assertion that "the fac- 
ulty of putting oneself in the place of others may be 
cultivated by means of fairy tale?," and thus the 
child's sympathies are "aroused in a variety of 
forms." True enough, but let the young reader 
take heed lest he be of those 

" Who, dabbling in the fount of fictive tears, 
And nursed by mealy-mouth'd philanthropies, 
Divorce the Feeling from her mate the Deed." 



JUVENILIZED SCIENCE, or the simple and attrac- 
tive treatment of more or less difficult subjects for 
the entertainment and, indirectly, the instruction of 
children, is something far more common in the book 
world to day than it was a hundred, or fifty, or even 
ten years ago. " Wireless Telegraphy for Amateurs 



and Students" will engage the willing attention of 
almost any wide-awake boy; "The Child's Day" 
succeeds even in presenting the subject of hygiene 
in a manner not repulsive to children ; and " Lessons 
for Junior Citizens " teaches the principles of civil 
government so that, though babes may not cry for 
the book, it need not draw tears from the young 
people who are required to read it. These three out 
of many such books are mentioned by Miss Elizabeth 
McCracken in her late work on "The American 
Child," in which she says, not without a little exag- 
geration : " It is safe to say that there is practically 
no subject so mature that it is not now the theme 
of a book, or a score of books, written especially for 
children. Every one of the numerous publishing 
houses in the United States issues yearly as many 
good volumes of this particular type as are submitted. 
A century ago a new writer was most likely to win 
the interest of a publisher by sending him a manu- 
script subtitled, ' A Novel.' At the present time a 
beginner can more quickly awaken the interest of a 
publisher by submitting a manuscript the title of 
which contains the words, 'For Children.'" 



DEAFNESS TO THE CALL OF ITALIAN CFLTURE is 
charged against the extra-Italian world by Mr. 
Douglas Ainslie in his " Introduction to Croce's 
Philosophy of the Practical," contributed to the 
October "North American Review." It may be 
well to ponder seriously, or as seriously as it de- 
serves, his plaint that "the Alps continue to be a 
barrier, and the thought of France and of Germany 
reaches us, as a rule, far more rapidly than that of 
the home of all the arts and of civilizatn n, as we 
may call that Italy which contains within it the 
classical Greater Greece. A striking instance of 
this relatively more rapid distribution of French 
thought is afforded by the celebrated Lundis of 
Sainte-Beuve, so familiar to many readers; yet a 
critic greater in depth than Sainte-Beuve was writ- 
ing at the same period greater in philosophical 
vision of the relations of things, for the vision of 
Sainte-Beuve rarely rose above the psychological 
plf*n a . For one reader acquainted with the History 
of Italian Literature of de Sanctis, a hundred are 
familiar with the Lundis of Sainte-Beuve." Never- 
theless, Mr. Ainslie finds that since the publication 
of his translation from the Italian philosopher 
named above "there has been some movement in 
the direction of the study of Italian thought and 
culture, which I advocated in the Introduction to 
that work." With the continuation of his scholarly 
undertaking, still in progress, there may be a still 
further turning of errant footsteps toward the home 
of all the arts. ... 

THE LITERATURE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES, that is, 

the books and pamphlets arid there are likely to he 
more pamphlets than books on the library shelves, 
is not always or often what some readers would call 
literature at all. It is certainly not belles lettres. 
Nevertheless, in looking over the current number of

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



the periodical, "Special Libraries," one meets with 
a few book-titles not devoid of interest even to lovers 
of literature not so rigidly special as that commonly 
handled by the special librarian. In the library of 
the Prudential Insurance Company, for instance, a 
library containing more than 150,000 volumes and 
pamphlets, the statistician of the company selects 
certain rare works for mention, the most ancient of 
which is the Latin treatise of 1622, " De Mercatura : 
Decisiones et Tractatus Varii, et de Rebus ad Earn 
Pertinentibus." Another venerable tome is the " Lex 
Mercatoria Rediviva," by Wyndham Beawes, pub- 
lished in London, 1752. One year earlier in date is 
Malachy Postlethwayt's " Dictionary of Trade and 
Commerce," and sufficiently ancient is John Wesk- 
ett's "Complete Digest of the Theory of Insurance," 
London, 1781. Among early American books on 
insurance, the shelves of the Prudential Company 
hold "An Account of Charitable Corporations for 
the Relief of Widows and Children," Philadelphia, 
1769, and the exceedingly rare "Plan of a Society 
for Making Provision for Widows by Annuities for 
the Remainder of Life," Boston, 1772. Even to such 
a strictly commercial theme as insurance the long, 
descriptive, sometimes quaint titles of eighteenth 
century treatises on that subject impart an interest 
not to be found in the curt names chosen for the 
publications of to-day. 



FUTILE LITERARY INDUSTRY has been engaged in, 
the more's the pity, by thousands of penmen since 
the invention of writing. A visit to the British 
Museum reading-room, with its concentric circles of 
desks all filled with busy persons engaged, in most 
instances, in writing or in the studies preliminary 
to writing, must prompt the query, How much of 
all this flow of ink is shed to any good purpose or 
with any lasting result? In a recently- printed 
"Short History of the Library Company of Phila- 
delphia," by Mr. George Maurice Abbot, librarian, 
are to be found some personal reminiscences of the 
writer's long connection with the famous old institu- 
tion founded by Franklin and his fellow-members 
of the "Junto." Among these recollections occurs 
the following: "Queer people from time to time 
have made a practice of coming to the Library. . . . 
One was known as the old Swede; he came every 
day for years, kept pen and ink in the John Dickin- 
son reading desk, and appeared to be taking notes, 
all day busily writing, but, strange to say, rarely 
asking for a book. Finally he came no more, and 
in the Dickinson desk was found only an old pen, 
some dried ink, and a roll of manuscript meaning 
nothing." Who knows but that, like Mr. Casaubon 
in "Middlemarch," he fully believed himself to be 
preparing an epoch-making contribution to human 
knowledge? 

AN EMPEROR'S BOOKS may distinguish themselves 
from other books by means of elaborate bindings and 
an imperial book-plate; otherwise they are likely 
to be not so very different from the books in any 
well-appointed library. Those who attend the great 



book-trade exhibition at Leipzig next year will have 
the pleasure of viewing the library of the reigning 
German Emperor, a collection of about six thousand 
volumes, two-thirds of which have been acquired by 
their owner in the quarter-century since his acces- 
sion. It is not a large library for a monarch, or 
even for a wealthy private individual, and it is con- 
siderably smaller than it would be but for the Kaiser's 
characteristic discard of about half the thirty-five 
hundred volumes handed down to him by his Hohen- 
zollern predecessors. After eliminating what seemed 
to him to be mere rubbish he made from time to time 
additions to the extent of four thousand or more 
works, and the enlarged and modernized collection 
is now catalogued under twelve general subject- 
headings, encyclopaedias and dictionaries, juris- 
prudence, economics and social science, colonial 
literature, archaeology and mythology, universal 
history, history of the Hohenzollerns, biography 
and correspondence, military science, geography 
and ethnography, German literature, and art works. 
The book plate to be found in each volume was, of 
course, " made in Germany," being designed by the 
artist Herr Ernst Doeppler, and shows the imperial 
arms with the inscription, "Ex libris Wilhelm II., 
Imperatoris Regis." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



ALPHONSO GERALD NEWCOMER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

You will perhaps not find it amiss to give place for a 
few words regarding the late Professor A. G Newcomer 
in addition to the note in your issue of October 1. It 
was my good fortune to be a colleague of Mr. New- 
comer's for ten years, and during a good part of that 
period to share the same office with him. Never was 
there a man more truly a colleague, as there was never 
one more truly a teacher. And never has there come 
into my experience his equal for the meekness and 
modesty which adorn scholarship but which are none 
too commonly noticed in philologist, critic, or pedagogue. 
His first letter to me, written before we had met, when 
I was about to join his department as a comparatively 
inexperienced teacher, was an offer to turn over to me 
a certain course in a subject with which he knew I had 
been concerned, graciously offering as reason, not the 
obvious fact that it was one of the few things I was 
competent to teach, but the belief that he had not yet 
found the right way to handle that difficult theme. 
Years later, I remember, when we were one day discuss- 
ing the impatience of the younger men over the slow- 
ness with which promotions were coming, Mr. Newcomer 
remarked that in earlier days they had been won more 
easily, adding: "I have often thought how little I de- 
served mine." In twenty years of academic life I have 
never heard this sentiment uttered sincerely by any 
other colleague. 

The same modesty of temper preserved in him that 
open-mindedness of outlook which keeps criticism sweet 
and makes possible continued acquisition and growth at 
an age when many scholars have ceased to do aught but 
reiterate and defend what they discovered when young. 
This temper may be exemplified by a characteristic

passage from a private letter written by Mr. Newcomer 
at a time when we were both doing some work on Shake- 
speare's sonnets a subject where it is almost a matter 
of course to revile one's predecessors in the field. 

" I am now engaged in reading Massey's work a 
stupendous volume; a little diffuse, but so earnest and 
interesting I cannot skim. And though I believe Massey 
is quite discredited now, his theory is a most engaging 
one. At any rate I think I shall be repaid for perusing 
him, for his analysis is so exhaustive that I shall at least 
get a good baptism in this apparently soundless ocean. 
At present, you can imagine, my eyes are full of water 
and sand, and I am gasping for breath. I find temporary 
comfort in turning to Wyndham, and repeating, after 
him, that after all the poetry is the main thing, the story 
a minor matter. And yet, all those circumstantial de- 
tails must have a story behind them." 

The past year was Mr. Newcomer's sabbatical, and 
he spent the greater part of his absence in the Mediter- 
ranean countries. His health failed so early that he 
was unable to carry out a good part of the externals of 
his programme, and when I saw him after his return it 
was natural to commiserate him on the spoiling of his 
long-looked-for journey. But he assured me, with his 
always unfailing cheerfulness, that there had been no 
disappointment; true, he could not go about as he had 
hoped, or even enjoy the expected intercourse with 
friends, but Italy had accomplished its old ministry for 
his inner life, it had been a rich experience. "I 
should have wished to do no differently," he said, " if I 
could have foreseen everything. I am wholly content 
with the journey, and wholly content that it is done, 
and that I can live with the memory, at home." There, 
in his California home, under his rose-vines, it was my 
privilege to say good-bye to him only a few days, as it 
proved, before the end. He had been reading a volume 
of Maeterlinck's tragedies when I came in, and showed 
it to me with his eager smile. Not just the book, I 
remarked, which some of us would choose as a source 
of good cheer in invalidism. " Perhaps not," he said, 
" but how beautiful ! " This gust of what is beautiful 
coupled always, to be sure, with discernment and 
restraint made him both the teacher and the critic 
that he was. He fulfilled, in other words, the wise 
saying which he once contributed to a discussion of the 
teaching of English ("The Nation," vol. 85, p. 301): 

" As for the inner spirit of literature, which we have 
so long hungered and striven to teach, may it not be 
largely trusted to find its way? The teacher who really 
feels it will never be able to conceal his feeling. The 
radiation that reaches him will be radiated in turn, the 
communicable communicated to so many as are ready 
to share in that grace."

IN MEMORY OF PROFESSOR NEWCOMER. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your issue of October 1 brought me the news of 
Professor A. G. Newcomer's death. He was my teacher 
in Greek in Knox College, and I could not help but con- 
trast the fresh delight of those studies under his inspir- 
ing companionship with the shadow that falls in thinking 
that his work is done. What aspirations and industry 
under many difficulties! With these feelings I have 
written the little tribute to his memory which follows. 



Comrade and friend, what way is yours, 
What heights in heaven do you climb, 
Now that the immanent flesh immures 
No more your steps in space and time ? 

I was a boy when yon were young, 
When truth was ours and fame to seek ; 
You taught me what the Scian sung 
Of fallen Troy in golden Greek. 

In Spring's enchanted long ago, 
In days of April cloud and sun, 
We scaled Armenia's peaks of snow 
Along the page of Xenophon. 

Now 'tis September in my heart. 
For loss of you, an Autumn time. 
Here lie the volumes of your art, 
True annalist of prose and rhyme. 

Yonr labor's done, closed is the book, 

Idle the once industrious pen, 

And vacant the secluded nook 

Where once yon gleaned the thoughts of men. 

Where the march ended was it May ? 
Where earth, some ocean-girdled cliff ? 
There, gazing, did your eye survey 
Life's many-pictured hieroglyph ? 

Glad for the battle nobly borne, 
Up to the Shadow's gorgon kiss. 
To wake in some new April morn 
Upon your hope's Anabasis. 

The sword and shield are hard to bear, 
The greaves hang heavy on the knee ; 
But, soldier of the soul, declare 
What was your vision of the sea !

INDIAN CENSORSHIP. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Some of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt's books about Egypt 
were recently ordered from the London publisher, Mr. 
Fisher Unwin, by a bookselling firm in Lahore, India. 
The parcel containing them was opened, Mr. Blunt's 
books were abstracted, and, after several months, 
returned mutilated to the shipper, in an unsaleable con- 
dition, certain passages having been officially marked 
as " objectionable." Concerning the circumstance, Mr. 
Blunt writes as follows to '-India": 

" It is a good example of the queer shifts to which 
a despotic Government is put which pretends not to be 
despotic yet governs by despotic methods. In Russia 
a book censorship is openly and directly exercised at 
the frontiers, and we, in England, call it an abuse of 
power when our books and periodicals are returned to 
us with passages officially deleted. In India the same 
thing is done, but the Government, by a trick, evades 
its responsibility. My books, it appears now, are not 
prohibited' in India; only prevented from entering the 
country in a saleable condition. I would remark that 
the volumes in question are no new publications, but 
have been many years issued and gone through several 
editions; they contain almost nothing about India. One 
of the passages most freely underlined is a reprint of 
my poem, ' The Wind and the Whirlwind,' an ancient 
protest in verse against the bombardment of Alexandria, 
published as long ago as 1883."

A POET ix EPISTOLARY MOOD.* 



Instead of wasting words in a vain attempt 
to describe the rare flavor of " Some Letters of 
William Vaughn Moody," which the poet's in- 
timate friend and cordial admirer, Mr. Daniel 
Gregory Mason, has so acceptably edited, the 
best plan will be to give the reader some liberal 
tastes of the volume here and there, and then 
trust to his running hotfoot in quest of the 
complete book in order to appease the hunger 
to which the foretastes will have but imparted 
a keener edge. The feast will leave him with 
only one regret, that it could not have been pro- 
longed ; but he will endeavor to console himself 
by recalling the good old maxim, that it is better 
to rise from table with an appetite than with a 
sense of surfeit. 

The letters extend over the last seventeen 
years of the poet's too-short life, beginning in 
1892, when he was twenty-three years old, and 
ending in 1909, when he had just entered upon 
his forty-first year. First we see him fretting, 
good-humoredly, in the bondage of tutorship 
and lectureship at Harvard and Chicago, where 
he corrected themes, discoursed on the beauties 
of English poetry, and counted the days till he 
could throw aside blue pencil and lecture notes 
and woo the muse in some congenial retreat, in 
Italy, England, or elsewhere. In course of time, 
and as his efforts in poetry and the drama gained 
recognition, he worked himself free of the hated 
thraldom ; but even while Pegasus wore the har- 
ness and the galls were still raw, he evidently 
found a sort of Carlylean relish in the very 
extravagance of those picturesquely emphatic 
epithets with which he knew so well how to 
depict his spiritual sufferings. For instance, 
he writes to Professor Robert Morss Lovett, 
his college mate and close friend, in this wise 
from Cambridge, where he was teaching English 
composition : 

" The midyears [examinations] have left me limp as 
a rag, and have convinced me that, instead of an amiable 
divorce such as you suggest, Philology and Minerva are 
destined to part with mutual scorn and vituperation, if 
indeed their feud does not result in pistols and pillow- 
chokings. If you want to rescue either of them you 
must come on in March as you promise, for I will not 
answer for their lives a day later than the twentieth." 

But when Cambridge had been exchanged 
for Chicago, the venerable elms and time-stained

traits. Boston : Houghton M i HI in Co. 



buildings of Harvard for the raw newness of the 
great western university, there was eloquent re- 
gret, a sorrow's crown of sorrow, in his vivid 
remembrance of happier things. To Mrs. 
Marks, who was then Miss Josephine Preston 
Peabody, he writes from the city by the lake : 

" Cambridge mellow and autumnal begins already 
to take on really mythic colors to loom symbolic, 
under the stress of this relentless prairie light and vast 
featureless horizon ... I do not know what this place 
is going to do for me, but I am sure of its potency its 
alchemical power to change and transmute. It is ap- 
pallingly ugly for one thing so ugly that the double 
curtain of night and sleep does not screen the aching 
sense. For another thing it is absorbing crude juice 
of life intellectual and social protoplasm Far aloft 
hovers phantom Poetry, no longer my delicate familiar. 
But I dream of another coming of hers, a new com- 
panionship more valorous and simple-hearted." 

A little later we read of at least a brief visi- 
tation, in which the poem that later became 
" Jetsam " was conceived. " Which reminds 
me," he says, a propos of nothing, in a letter 
to Mr. Mason, "that, having a few hours last 
week for ecstatic contemplation of my navel, I 
emitted a more or less piercing yawp there- 
concerning, in the form of a new treatment of 
the moon theme." Not only lecturing and 
theme-correcting, but also hack-work for pub- 
lishers took the time he would fain have devoted 
wholly to original composition. Also, at times, 
the charms of some fair one seem to have dis- 
quieted him. In the following passage the 
"Uncle Horace" referred to is the late Mr. 
Scudder, for whom Moody was doing some edi- 
torial work as a pot-boiler: 

" I have been brutally busy since getting back, on 
Uncle Horace's book, so that all my schemes of spirit- 
ual conquest are done up in moth-balls for the time 
being. . . . One o'clock midnight, and the morrow 
flames responsibility. Hire a typewriter marry one 
if necessary and we will annihilate space. I have a 
creature to tell you about but a Creature ! " 

Six months later, to the same trusted friend, 
Mr. Mason, he writes again in similar strain, 
this time giving in prose form the substance, 
or rather the airy unsubstantiality, with much of 
the imagery, that later became " Dawn Parley," 
a poetic rhapsody rejected for some unknown 
reason when he came to make up the "Poems" 
of 1901. Mrs. Moody says he felt that "The 
Golden Journey" made it superfluous, as we 
learn from a note of Mr. Mason's. Here is the 
semi-humorous, semi-sentimental prose version : 
" I have had an enormous little adventure since I 
wrote last. Another Girl, of course. This time a 
Westerner par excellence a Calif ornian, dating men- 
tally from the age of Rousseau and Chateaubriand, with 
geysers and cloud bursts of romanticism, not to say

sentimentality; dating spiritually from the Age of Gold, 
or some remoter purity, some Promethean dawn, some 
first foam-birth in hyperborean seas. She likes Gib- 
son's drawings, adores Munsey's, and sings ' Don't be 
Cross, Dear ' with awful unction. After this you will 
not believe me when I say that she gave me the most 
unbearable shiver of rapture at recognition of essential 
girlhood that I for a long time remember. Well, have 
you ever slept under the same roof with sucli a person, 
in the country, and wakened at that moment before 
dawn when in the ' spectral uncompounded light ' the 
spirit is least capable of defense, when it feels only a 
membrane separating it from the shock of joy and woe 
as they stream from the passionate dayspring, and have 
you felt the sense of that common shelter like a caress, 
heard through walls and doors the rise and fall of her 
breast as an ineffable rhythm swaying the sun? If you 
have you can realize the gone feeling that possessed 
me when she said (interpreting my own gloomy guess) 
that my kind was not her kind, that my language was 
not her language, and that her soul could only be stu- 
dious to avoid mine, as the bird flying southward in 
spring avoids the hunter. I bowed assent and came 
home. I now nurse memories and grow elegiac." 

Less than a month afterward he writes again to 
the same correspondent, enclosing what he calls 
"a reaction on a recent notable Experience." 
To complete this little story of a poem in the 
making, let us reproduce the verses, especially 
as they are omitted from the familiar collection 
of his works. The title, as already stated, is 
"Dawn Parley." 

" I woke upon the edge of day, 
The east was wild with racing light, 
All meek and wild my spirit lay 
Star-shaken with delight. 

" I said, ' This moment she doth wake 
Within the chamber next but one, 
She sees the morning-glory shake 
Its trumpets to the sun.' 

* A bird that had his headstrong say 
Outside my casement, frilled and went; 
All wild and wan my spirit lay 
With sudden anguish rent. 

" For yesternight I laid my brain 
And all my soul's dim banded powers 
Open to her, who said, ' 'T is plain 
Thy ways are none of ours. 

" ' Though nobly good to thine and thee, 
To us thy ways are strange and drear; 
I go with my sweet friends to be, 
And thou must tarry here.' 

" Above the hurry of the light 
All meek and wild my spirit hung, 
From the far hills I scared the night 
And in the zenith sung, 

"<O! playmates of her heedless hours, 
Her eyes ye never more may see: 
My brain and all my soul's dim powers 
Possess her utterly.' " 



So bold and dexterous an artist in words as 
Moody one will not meet again in many months. 
There is notable pruning of extravagances as 
years sober the mind, but to the very end he 
was panting to achieve fresh triumphs in the 
manner of handling his medium. He says to 
one of his friendly critics : " I think you are not 
tolerant enough of the instinct for conquest in 
language, the attempt to push out its boundaries, 
to win for it continually some new swiftness, 
some rare compression, to distil from it a more 
opaline drop." 

Mr. Mason's Introduction, written in loyal 
affection and admiration for his friend, forms an 
important part of the volume, and has no little of 
the glow and shimmer of the pages that follow. 
In speaking of Moody 's endless pains with the 
manuscript of his poems, his corrections upon 
corrections, layers deep, Mr. Mason likens his 
much-emended lines to " the pediments of ruined 
temples, with columns of words rising at irregular 
intervals to unequal heights" exciting a nat- 
ural query in the reader whether pediment is not 
here inadvertently made to do duty for pedestal 
or some similar word. On the whole, it is a 
satisfaction, a delight even, to have this volume 
of Moody's informal prose, as an object lesson 
in the making of a poet and a commentary on 
some of his poems. Its high-hearted, vigorous, 
always finely imaginative style cannot but make 
young readers rejoice in their youth, and older 
ones feel their thinner blood pulsing a little more 
quickly in their veins. Two portraits of Moody 
in his early manhood, with a facsimile page of 
his manuscript, enrich the volume.

The task of continuing the late John C. 
Ropes's admirable work on the Civil War, two 
volumes of which had appeared at the time of 
the author's death in 1899, was assigned to 
Colonel William Koscoe Livermore; and the 
first instalment of the continuation has re- 
cently been published in two volumes, covering 
the campaigns of 1863 up to July 10. Colonel 
Livermore is an officer of the United States 
army, a member of the Massachusetts Military 
Historical Society, and the author of several

books on the art and science of war. There is 
every evidence that his work is as careful and 
painstaking in method, as full and unbiased in 
treatment, as the most exacting critic might 
require. The official records of the Union and 
Confederate armies have been studied and di- 
gested with all diligence; and, as far as the 
present reviewer can judge, every other trust- 
worthy source of importance has been consulted 
and properly evaluated. It may be said at once 
that Colonel Livermore has shown himself 
worthy to continue the work of Colonel Ropes, 
whose untimely death left his task but well 
begun. 

The author's point of view, as stated in the 
Introduction, is frankly warlike. He says: 

" In the struggle for existence, great nations are 
crowding upon each other. Universal peace will not be 
possible until conflicting interests shall have been ad- 
justed All nations but our own are preparing for 
defense. By neglecting to bear our share of the 
burden, we are insulting the rest of the civilized world 
upon whom we now rely for our safety in the hope that 
each nation will hold the other in check, and save us 
from all trouble and expense. . . . The history of the 
Civil War is useful in keeping alive the military inter- 
est of the present generation so that the next may have 
some civil history to record." 

On this reasoning one should regret the extra- 
ordinary "peace developments" of the last few 
months; for if all the nations should continue 
their arbitration agreements and expand the 
operations of the Hague tribunal, it would seem 
that the "necessary wars" may not come, and 
in that case succeeding generations will have no 
civil history to record. It is an interesting 
result of military thinking in the United States 
that the Civil War should now be regarded as 
a thing for which thanks should be rendered, 
since it has been the means of keeping alive 
the warlike passions, or at any rate a pride in 
successful conflict. 

In volume one of this second part of the 
general work of Ropes and Livermore there is 
a careful analysis of the positions of the con- 
tending forces in the Civil War. The import- 
ance to both sides of Vicksburg, Chattanooga, 
and Richmond is clearly shown. The difficul- 
ties of the tasks of the contending generals are 
made more evident than in previous works. 
As to the numbers of men engaged, there is no 
disposition to under-estimate the Federals and 
over-estimate the Confederates, a weakness of 
most writers on the war. Colonel Livermore 
places the Union strength on January 1, 1863, 
at 547,100 men, the Confederate at 272,100. 
That is to say, the armies of Grant, Rosen- 
cranz, and Hooker were more than twice as 



strong in human material as those of Pember- 
ton, Bragg, and Lee. This is almost conceding 
the contention of the South that it was out- 
numbered "three to one." English military 
critics, like Henderson and Wood and Edmonds, 
in their admirable studies of the war, have 
made similar estimates. It is clear to all that 
the long-standing quarrel between North and 
South as to numbers of men engaged is about 
to terminate with judgment in favor of the South- 
ern claims. 

Of the commanders and their personal quali- 
fications, Colonel Livermore says less than might 
be wished; but it must be recalled that Ropes 
has already given us many character sketches 
of the leading generals, though he wrote with 
less sympathy for the Southerners than the 
present author would have shown. Lee receives 
some attention, and his place of primacy among 
all the generals of the war is acknowledged, he 
is characterized as " the greatest captain of his 
age." General Grant is not so highly praised, 
though his work at Vicksburg is compared 
to that of Napoleon at Ulm. It should be 
said, however, that this comparison is quoted 
from Halleck, and is not offered as the author's 
opinion. Pemberton had no conception of the 
problem which it was his business to solve at 
Vicksburg; nor does Joseph E. Johnston win 
from Colonel Livermore any of the high praise 
which General Sherman awarded him after the 
war was over. 

The battle of Gettysburg receives the most 
detailed study and analysis, about one-fifth of 
the work being given to the account of that 
sanguinary conflict. The claim is made and 
ably supported that Meade in Pennsylvania, 
and not Grant at Vicksburg, secured the life of 
the American nation, because Lee "bore the 
fortunes of the Confederacy on his saddle bow," 
and he who struck at Lee and his army struck 
at the true objective. The number of men who 
took part in the battle are again given according 
to the disputed Confederate estimates, that is, 
Meade had 96,000 and Lee only 76,000. These 
figures are not very different from those cited 
by Mr. Rhodes, the general historian of the war. 
The question of who was to blame for the Con- 
federate disaster on the third day of the battle 
is no nearer a settlement in Colonel Livermore's 
pages than it has been before. The Englishmen, 
Wood and Edmonds, in their brief but admirable 
work, say bluntly that Longstreet must bear the 
blame; and they go so far as to criticize Lee 
because he failed to order a court martial. This 
is the view of most Southern writers, though 



1913] 



THE DIAL,

Lee never gave an opinion on the subject, either 
in his report of the battle or, as far as the present 
reviewer has been able to ascertain, in his later 
conversations or private correspondence. In 
fact, the great Confederate general assumed re- 
sponsibility for all the errors of that fatal day ; 
and in view of the unparalleled boldness of some 
of his orders this seems not unjust, as Colonel 
Livermore makes plain. In this, the keen and 
discerning Southern general, E. P. Alexander, 
chief of artillery of the Confederate army, sus- 
tains the author; and most Northern writers 
are of the same opinion. Gettysburg was the 
gigantic blunder of a great soldier. The reason 
is plain. Lee had beaten McClellan, Pope, 
Burnside, and Hooker in quick succession ; he 
thought himself invincible and his army thought 
itself invincible, and both army and commander 
stood ready for any hazardous task. The 
Southern people also spurred their greatest war 
machine onward, seeking battle on Northern 
soil and expecting victory. The outcome is 
known to everyone : the Confederacy there be- 
gan its downward career. 

Meade's failure to attack Lee on the 4th of 
July is explained by Colonel Livermore much 
to the credit of the sturdy Northern leader. 
He knew the risk, and dreaded the effect on 
Northern opinion of a possible defeat. He and 
his officers were so accustomed to defeat that 
they thought it best to maintain the prestige 
won by the three-days' fighting, and endeavor 
thus to reinspire the Northern people, who had 
grown sick of disaster. This is the reasoning 
which Colonel Livermore thinks occupied the 
mind of Meade. Other writers have made out 
the same case for the hero of Gettysburg, and 
possibly this is the correct view. But it admits 
the interpretation that the head of a victorious 
army, a third stronger than the defeated foe, 
was afraid of Lee; that victory had not been 
expected, and that the risk of a second encounter 
was too great to take. It shows the prestige of 
the Southern commander, and tends to prove 
that the war was not so near its end as is claimed 
by the very men who justify Meade. In war 
much depends upon a single throw of the dice, 
and it was altogether likely that the army of 
Northern Virginia would yet regain its high 
position and win the coveted Southern indepen- 
dence. 

There are many interesting questions raised 
in these pages which one would like to discuss 
at length, did space permit. It only remains to 
say that all who desire a fair and straightforward 
account of the military movements of 1863 need 



but turn to these volumes. And all who know 
the earlier work of Colonel Ropes will rejoice 
that the same spirit and the same keen intelli- 
gence which distinguished the author of the 
first part of the work also pervade the pages of 
Colonel Livermore's continuation.

JANE AUSTEN'S HOME 



Jane Austen is in the foreground again. As 
a matter of fact, "poor little Jane," as some 
unfriendly critics have gratuitously called her, 
has never been very far in the background at 
any time during the past thirty or forty years. 
Since the publication in 1870 of the Memoir by 
her nephew, J. E. Austen-Leigh, no less than 
eight biographies of the novelist have appeared, 
to say nothing of introductions, sketches, criti- 
cisms, and appreciations, which it might be diffi- 
cult to count. It may be of interest to add that 
at least ten important editions of the novels 
have been published since 1880. Now we have 
a fresh narrative of Jane Austen's life, a 
"Family Record" as its authors describe it, 
by the son and the grandson of the author of the 
Memoir. It is a volume of four hundred pages, 
with a charming portrait and with an appendix 
which contains variant readings and corrections 
of the text of the novels, also a partial bibli- 
ography. 

The publication of this work is justified by 
its authors on the ground that the earlier nar- 
rative failed to take account of Jane Austen's 
life on its emotional and romantic side; more- 
over, as they claim, its author "hardly knew 
how much she had gone into society, or how 
much, with a certain characteristic aloofness, 
she had enjoyed it"; and, thirdly, the uneventful 
nature of the author's life they think has been 
exaggerated. These are interesting points cer- 
tainly, and thoroughly important; for tradition 
has imaged Jane Austen as unromantic and 
unemotional, shut in by the narrow environment 
of a small and isolated Hampshire village, lead- 
ing a secluded life, with few social opportunities, 
shy, ignorant of the world and indifferent to its 
great events. 

The early home of Jane Austen at Steventon 
does naturally suggest retirement if not isolation. 
It is in a shallow valley among low-lying hills ; 
the rectory, elm-shaded, is at the end of a row 
of cottages; the church, small and solitary but

interesting because of its age (it dates from the 
tenth or eleventh century), stands beyond the 
village ; aged hawthorns blossom in the church- 
yard, and a lone yew, as ancient as the church, 
droops above the graves. This was Jane Aus- 
ten's home for five and twenty years; here she 
planned and wrote "Northanger Abbey" and the 
sketches, later revised and amplified in u Sense 
and Sensibility" and "Pride and Prejudice." 
We think instinctively of that other rectory at 
Haworth where the Brontes, a generation later, 
lived their precocious childhood ; but the atmos- 
phere of the Yorkshire moors was different from 
that of the Hampshire downs, and there was 
nothing abnormal in the life at Steventon rec- 
tory. Rev. George Austen was a man of placid 
disposition, serenely tempered ; Mrs. Austen 
was positive, shrewd, determined. From her 
mother, Jane inherited her acute insight into 
character, her energy and her sense of humor ; 
her refinement of intellect, her appreciation of 
literary achievement, and her serenity came from 
her father. There were eight children in the 
home, of whom Jane was the seventh ; her oldest 
brother was ten years her senior, and Cassandra, 
her only sister, was two years older than herself. 
Thus closely drawn together by their ages, the 
two sisters were inseparable until death parted 
them, each regarding the other as her second 
self. It was a pleasant country home, with a 
touch of the farm in its activities. The Rector 
kept his horses, and Mrs. Austen supervised a 
dairy and a poultry yard. The boys were en- 
thusiastic lovers of sport ; two of them afterward 
entered the navy and each attained the rank of 
admiral. While the girls were still young the 
older brothers had completed their course at 
Oxford and were at home assisting in the edu- 
cation of the sisters. Jane was given a taste of 
boarding-school life between the ages of seven 
and nine, but she appears rather to have accom- 
panied Cassandra because she could not endure 
the separation from her sister than for any more 
serious purpose. It was always a reading house- 
hold, and reference is frequent in the memoir to 
the books and authors of the day. The children 
were fond of amateur theatricals, and acted plays 
with elaborate preparation, using the barn as a 
theatre in summer, the dining-room in winter. 

Socially, the Austens were the most import- 
ant family in the village ; they enjoyed the best 
society in the countryside, and exercised a liberal 
hospitality in the entertainment of friends and 
relatives. Their circle of acquaintances was 
large, and life was far from dull. As Cassandra 
and Jane grew older they found apparently no 



lack of amusement such as naturally appeals to 
young people, in the way of parties, balls, and 
the regular monthly assembly held at Ba sing- 
stoke. Under date of January 9, 1796, Jane 
writes to her sister, in a characteristically lively 
strain : 

"You scold me so much in the nice long letter which 
I have this moment received from you, that I am almost 
afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. 
Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and 
shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down to- 
gether. I can expose myself, however, only once more, 
because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, 
on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. 
He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young 
man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, 
except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he 
is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he 
is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when 
we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago." 

The youth referred to, Tom Lefroy, was the 
nephew of a dear friend of the Austens, the 
wife of the rector in the neighboring parish of 
Ashe. This " very gentlemanlike, good-looking, 
pleasant young man " was afterward Chief Jus- 
tice of Ireland ; he was not the hero of Jane 
Austen's one actual romance. 

It will be readily seen that Jane Austen's 
girlhood was by no means solitary, nor was it 
quite untouched by the stimulus of outside 
events. Two years previous to the date of the 
letter quoted here, the quiet life of the rectory 
was disturbed by an incident which must have 
brought the grim tragedy of the French Revo- 
lution very forcibly to the imagination of this 
impressionable girl, then eighteen. A cousin 
of the Austens had married a French nobleman 
who, in 1794, was guillotined at Paris. His 
wife, the countess, had been intimately asso- 
ciated with the family at Steventon, had visited 
them shortly before her husband's arrest, and 
may possibly have been at Steventon when the 
execution took place. 

Moreover, we must not think of the experi- 
ences even of these earlier years as limited by 
the narrow boundaries of a country village. 
Jane had had her first glimpse of London at 
twelve years of age. There were numerous con- 
nections of the family with whom visits were 
constantly being exchanged. One of the elder 
brothers settled in London, another inherited 
an extensive estate in Kent. Cassandra and 
Jane were often in these homes, sometimes to- 
gether, sometimes singly, and a varied society 
was thus opened to them. The popular and 
lively resort of Bath was distant but two days' 
easy travel by post chaise. A brother of Mrs. 
Austen, a gentleman of ample means and ad- 



1913]

dieted to gout, was frequently at Bath, and it 
was a common occurrence for Jane and Cas- 
sandra to be entertained by their uncle and 
aunt. That Miss Austen made effective use of 
what she observed in the society of this lively 
resort is evident to her readers. In 1801, on 
account of the Rector's failing health, the home 
at Steventon was broken up and the entire 
family removed to Bath, residing there until 
after Mr. Austen's death in 1805. It was prob- 
ably about the period of this change in their 
affairs that the one serious romantic episode 
occurred in the life of the novelist. The facts 
are obscure ; the circumstances, even the name 
of Jane's lover, are unknown. The meeting 
apparently took place one summer when Jane 
and Cassandra were at the seashore ; the gentle- 
man died of some sudden illness within a few 
months of the beginning of their acquaintance. 
By a strange coincidence, Cassandra's only love- 
affair was terminated in the same pathetic way. 

Jane Austen's literary activities began early ; 
she had written stories and dramatic sketches 
before she was sixteen, but these contained 
nothing notable except their style, which was 
pure and simple; the sense of humor which 
they betrayed was already keen. In later life 
Miss Austen expressed the wish that she had 
read more and written less ; there is, however, 
no good reason why we should coincide in this 
opinion, which was, after all, only a bit of advice 
to a little girl of twelve over-fond of scrib- 
bling. At all events Jane slipped easily into the 
first stages of serious composition before she 
was twenty. The family were great novel- 
readers, "and not ashamed of being so." 
The name of Jane Austen appears in the list of 
subscribers to "Camilla," published in 1796. 
It is even possible that she may have met 
Madame d'Arblay, who, from 1793 to 1797, 
lived in the adjoining county of Surrey, a neigh- 
bor and intimate friend of cousins of the Austens 
with whom Jane visited. In " Sense and Sen- 
sibility" one may find traces perhaps of the 
author's interest in " Evelina." The fact that 
Jane's first version of her novel, the " Elinor 
and Marianne," followed the epistolary form is 
significant of the writer's respect for these earlier 
English novels, especially for the works of 
Richardson. 

Jane Austen was singularly objective in all 
her literary work. She never intrudes. There 
is a reminiscence of her own early efforts at 
self-education in the account of Elizabeth Ben- 
net's girlhood, and a reminder of her own 
feelings at the breaking-up of the home at 



Steventon in the grief of Marianne at leaving 
Norland. There is also a suggestion of the 
school days at Reading in the description of 
Mrs. Goddard's school in "Emma." The only 
probable portrait is that of one of the sailor 
brothers in the character of William Price, in 
" Mansfield Park "; but these are almost the 
only allusions of a purely personal nature in all 
her works. Writing to her sister in 1798, she 
speaks severely of a certain novel which offended 
her literary sense in this respect. 

" Never did any book carry more internal evidence 
of its author. Every sentiment is completely Egerton's. 
There is very little story, and what there is is told in 
a strange, unconnected way. There are many char- 
acters introduced, apparently merely to be delineated." 

This criticism is particularly interesting as it 
antedates the revision of her first two novels, 
and was written while she was busy on the first 
draft of "Northanger Abbey." 

The last eight years of Jane Austen's life 
were spent at Chawton, where Mrs. Austen and 
her daughters lived in a pleasant country house 
on the estate of one of her sons. Not far from 
Steventon, the scene of her first productive 
period, the novelist here resumed her literary 
work with serious purpose. It was at Chawton 
that her first two novels were finally prepared 
for the press, and here that " Mansfield Park," 
" Emma," and " Persuasion " were written. In 
the general sitting-room at Chawton, Miss Aus- 
ten did most of her literary work, subject to 
interruptions from servants, children, and visit- 
ors, writing on small sheets of paper which 
could be easily slipped under her blotting-pad 
whenever the creaking swing-door gave notice 
that anyone was coming. Modest and shy in 
regard to her work, and altogether indifferent 
to fame, she evaded publicity ; few outside the 
circle of her relatives learned her secret while 
she lived. 

At this day it is unnecessary to discuss Jane 
Austen's place in literature, or to weigh her 
work to estimate its values, human or artistic. 
She herself once spoke of " the little bit, two 
inches wide, of ivory on which I work with so 
fine a brush, as produces little effect after much 
labor "; no one has described her process better. 
She used material which was familiar and which 
she understood ; she loved the field in which 
she found it. To her niece, whose literary am- 
bition had found expression at an early age, she 
said: 

" You are now collecting your people delightfully, 
getting them exactly into such a spot as is the delight 
of my life. Three or four families in a country village 
is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will write 



306

a great deal more, and make full use of them while 
they are so favorably arranged." 

Such depreciation of Miss Austen's accom- 
plishment as exists is based upon what she did 
not do rather than upon what she did, an 
unsound basis for criticism of one who achieved 
so much. One might justly criticise her favorite 
poets, Cowper and Crabbe, because they did 
not write otherwise than they did. 

The " Life and Letters " now published has 
its chief merit in bringing the youth of Jane 
Austen and the period of her first literary de- 
velopment more vividly to light. In giving 
proper emphasis to the emotional and social 
side of her nature the authors of the book have 
really helped us to understand her better ; there 
is no question that they have corrected some 
erroneous impressions regarding this most inter- 
esting personality. w. E. SIMONDS. 



BYZANTINE AND ROMANESQUE 
ARCHITECTURE.* 



The receding waves of enthusiasm for single 
architectural styles or for a restricted hierarchy 
of styles are laying bare a broad margin for 
appreciation and legitimate individual prefer- 
ence. The day is still not wholly past when 
critics, by rigid exclusion of all architecture not 
perfect in structural expression, limit their ad- 
miration to the Greek and the Gothic, or even 
to the masterpieces of these styles, the Parthenon 
and the cathedral of Amiens. An increasing 
tolerance, the result of keener vision, is now, 
however, permitting the enrollment of one ex- 
onerated style after another under the old shib- 
boleth "Reason in Architecture." The motto 
has not been changed, but the reasons accepted 
are more numerous and varied. Roman archi- 
tecture, Renaissance, baroque, and modern 
architecture, all have been recently defended, 
and, if not wholly free from the stigma of incom- 
plete structural logic, have been justified as 
possessing high qualities. 

In his latest work, "Byzantine and Roman- 
esque Architecture," Mr. Thomas Graham 
Jackson, the veteran English architect and 
writer, appears as one of the champions of these 
two relatively neglected styles, which, though 
they have escaped positive condemnation, have 
usually been contrasted unfavorably with the 
Gothic. Instances could be multiplied in which

Thomas Graham Jackson, R.A. In two volumes. Illustrated.

American agents. 



he contravenes the traditional view. Speaking 
of the French Romanesque of Auvergne, he says : 
" After spending some weeks among the robust 
round-arched churches that we have been de- 
scribing, one finds the Gothic of the cathedral 
of Clermont thin and unsatisfactory . . . one 
misses the broad simplicity, the generous solidity 
of column, arch, and wall, the grandeur of un- 
broken surf ace that gives the earlier Romanesque 
a dignity, and at the same time a geniality that 
one fails to find in the more scientific construc- 
tion of the later style." Again, in the conclud- 
ing chapter: "Inferior as they are in science, 
the solidity of the Romanesque buildings with 
their sturdy columns and massive proportions 
will often satisfy the artist eye better than the 
more slender and ingenious constructions of a 
later day, when the architect economized sub- 
stance almost as closely as the engineer." 

That this is not an isolated preference, but an 
instance of changing critical sentiment, is illus- 
trated by similar relaxation of purist rigors 
against Roman architecture, from which the 
Romanesque took its departure. 

" It is quite true that ornament rises in value in pro- 
portion as it illustrates and emphasizes the construction; 
and the converse is also true that ornament is indefen- 
sible when it falsifies or conceals it. But to the latter 
charge, at all events, the Roman architect need not plead 
guilty : his wall decoration by columns and entablatures 
deceives nobody; no one would take them for the main 
supports of the building. ... It does not do to apply 
the canon of utility too rigidly to every decorative 
feature in architecture. The objection which is raised 
against Roman architecture on Ruskinite principles 
might with equal force be taken to much that we admire 
in Gothic. . . . The Gothic spire itself is an extrava- 
gance if we look merely to its original function as a 
covering to the tower. While on the one hand we should 
try to make decoration as significant as we can, it is 
clear that if the test of utility is pedantically enforced, 
there will be an end of architecture altogether." 

It is by a freedom from bigotry and preconcep- 
tion, of which this ability to see freshly is an 
evidence, that Mr. Jackson makes his chief con- 
tribution to the discussion of his subject. 

In other ways the book is often disappointing. 
The author frequently seems unaware of cur- 
rent controversies which one might reasonably 
expect to find discussed. The only reference 
to purposed irregularities, or refinements, in the 
laying out of the buildings considered is a brief 
mention of those in the facade of the cathedral 
of Pisa, based upon Ruskin's early observa- 
tions. With Mr. William H. Goodyear's ex- 
tended researches on this monument and the 
pthers of its group he seems unacquainted. 
Mr. Goodyear's demonstration, published some 
years ago, that the campanile at Pisa was from

THE DIAL 



307 



the beginning intended to lean was sufficiently 
plausible to convince many scholars, including 
those attached to the Italian government, yet 
Mr. Jackson speaks simply of the "accident" 
of its leaning. It is interesting to note, how- 
ever, that he, like Mr. Goodyear, considers the 
inclination an artistic merit, and thus furnishes 
a disinterested corroboration of the motive 
assigned for building the tower in this manner. 
Of Professor C. H. Moore's ideas on mediaeval 
church architecture and the origins of Gothic 
he seems equally unregardful. To treat the 
pointed arch as the fundamental differentia of 
Gothic seems nowadays rather naive. 

These instances open the way to a general 
discussion of Mr. Jackson's method and its 
bearing on the value of his work. His confessed 
limitation to buildings, or at least to classes of 
buildings, which he has visited and studied 
himself is praiseworthy for caution, but makes 
the work a partial collection of monographs 
rather than a well rounded history. This would 
not be so serious if seeming unfamiliarity with 
some of the omitted classes of monuments did 
not tend to impair the authority of certain of 
his generalizations. Discussion of the recipro- 
cal influences of Byzantium and Italy without 
thorough knowledge of the churches of Greece 
and of South Italy can scarcely carry conviction. 
The great amount of matter descriptive of sin- 
gle monuments included tends to obscure the 
general historic outline. Much of it, though 
doubtless based on personal observation, merely 
repeats information which is common property, 
and even when fresh facts are presented it is 
questionable if the place and the manner of 
presentation are of the best. A series of topo- 
graphical works for the local styles most dis- 
cussed, such as the Byzantine of Constantinople 
and Salonica, or the Romanesque of Great 
Britain, similar to the same author's admirable 
"Dalmatia," would seem a more suitable form. 

Freed from the mass of description, the his- 
torical introductions and summaries emerge as 
the most interesting parts of the book. By 
newer or better readings of history, they often 
healthily correct superficial views advanced by 
previous historians of the relation of art to 
environment. Among such suggestive analyses, 
those of the condition of Italy in post- Roman 
times, and of the circumstances surrounding 
the building of the great French churches seem 
especially just. 

The illustrations show few unfamiliar monu- 
ments, but they are frequently taken from un- 
hackneyed points of view and show details 



which are little known. The author's sketches, 
some of them made more than fifty years ago, 
have often an added value through showing 
buildings as they formerly stood. The rich- 
ness of sketchbooks from which such an uncon- 
templated selection could be made is a testimony 
to the breadth of personal observation on which 
Mr. Jackson so much depends. The expressed 
prejudice against photography, however, is 
scarcely borne out by the relative clearness and 
superior authenticity of the photographs repro- 
duced. 

As covering the same general field, the book 
invites comparison with Mr. Arthur Kingsley 
Porter's recent work, " Mediaeval Architecture," 
though this latter is intentionally confined to 
styles in the main line of development towards 
Gothic. Mr. Porter's thread of narrative and 
generalization is much easier to follow than 
Mr. Jackson's; his descriptions of single monu- 
ments are wisely relegated to appended lists. 
With its rich provision of bibliographies and 
abstracts from archaeological literature, it re- 
sembles the German " Handbiicher," summar- 
izing the state of knowledge concerning its 
subject. Mr. Jackson's book, in contrast, is 
essentially personal, and derives its mellowness 
from years of life and experience. Though 
difficult to classify as to form, it is welcome as 
preserving a knowledge of the buildings dis- 
cussed which is scarcely to be equalled for 
intimacy among our own generation or the gen- 
eration of our fathers.

DIVERSE ASPECTS OF BOTANY.* 



The title of Professor F. W. Oliver's recent 
volume, "Makers of British Botany," should 
rather have been, "British Makers of Botany." 
The book contains brief biographies of men 
who did indeed live in Britain, but who studied 
the botany of the world. For this reason, the 
work is of interest, not only in the British 
Islands, but wherever students have occasion 
to follow in the footsteps of such illustrious 
masters as the Hookers, father and son, Lind- 
ley, Harvey, Berkeley, Williamson, and the 
rest. The chapters have been written by various 
well-known botanists, and with two exceptions

each author is discussed by one who is expert 
in the branch of botany he especially cultivated ; 
but taken all together, the treatment necessarily 
lacks continuity and unity. Perhaps the strong- 
est impression gained after reading this series 
of biographies is that science progresses in very 
different ways and through the labors of very 
different men. In one case we observe what 
seems like a dignified and orderly pageant of 
progress ; in another, erratic and irregular out- 
bursts, in which real contributions to knowledge 
are mixed with quite other matters. Here we 
see the eminent official, honored and well paid ; 
there the patient amateur, who does what he 
can, for the love of it, in the intervals of a busy 
life. All have scientific zeal; but their other 
possessions, mental and material, may be infin- 
itely diverse. All who would be students should 
read such a book as this, if only to perceive 
that the aristocratic level in science cuts nearly 
at right angles to the more familiar social strata. 
It is this which stultifies even academic distinc- 
tions in the long run. 

Dr. William F. Ganong, professor of botany 
in Smith College, has long been known as an 
ardent and independent worker, especially de- 
voted to the pedagogy of his subject. He now 
extends the scope of his endeavor, and produces 
a book, " The Living Plant," designed not for 
experts, or even for college classes, but for the 
great multitude of those who desire a readable 
and intelligible account of the principles of 
botany. So, he says, "I have been at more 
pains to be clear than to be brief, assuming on 
the part of my reader no great knowledge of 
the subject, but a large willingness to take 
trouble to learn." He has also frankly faced 
the philosophical questions underlying all bio- 
logical studies, and arrives at a position which 
he calls " supervitalism." To those who see 
only mechanism in all life-phenomena, this atti- 
tude will be abhorrent, and Dr. Ganong will be 
accused of exhibiting superficial vagueness in 
place of the precision expected of a scientific 
man. Others will remember that the great root 
of superstition has been the desire to find simple 
explanations, short-cuts to the understanding 
of nature's mysteries. Hearing in thunder the 
angry growls of Zeus, one had no occasion to 
know anything about electricity. Is it not pos- 
sible, to say the least, that in our modern zeal 
for complete " explanation " we may merely 
flatten out and smooth down our mental con- 
cepts, leaving nature herself as rugged as before ? 



So if Dr. Ganong seems a little ambiguous in his 
philosophy, it is not necessary to suppose that 
he himself knows exactly what he means ; the 
point is, that there is something he and we can 
feel and yet not understand. Those who insist 
most loudly that they stick to " facts," and are 
content with " known causes," end by making 
those "facts" and "causes" do all the work; 
a proceeding quite analogous to that of the men 
of old, who explained what they could by no 
possibility then understand, by overworking 
" facts " already familiar to them. To return 
to Dr. Ganong's book : it is an excellent intro- 
duction to botany, readable and clear. It is 
illustrated by a number of useful figures and 
diagrams. From the standpoint of a beginner, 
it has perhaps one fault : the discussions are 
too general, without sufficient citation of partic- 
ular cases. On account of this, notwithstanding 
a high degree of lucidity, it may sometimes be 
difficult to hold the attention. The student 
cannot be so precipitately synthetic. 

Messrs. Knight and Step's "Popular Bot- 
any," originally published in England and now 
reissued in this country, is a large two-volume 
work, with (to quote literally from the title-page) 
"721 beautiful illustrations and 18 colored 
plates." It is a cleverly written popular compi- 
lation, prepared by men who know much about 
the subject. The authors have taken a great 
deal of trouble to search out interesting passages 
in various writings and quote them at length, 
thus enlivening their narrative. The very nu- 
merous illustrations are of unequal merit. The 
plate facing the title-page of the first volume 
represents a tropical African plant, drawn by 
Sir H. H. Johnston, and is truly magnificent. 
The text-figures include very many excellent 
reproductions fiom photographs, and a large 
number of very poor drawings, that of the Leaf 
Butterfly (Vol. I., p. 4) being positively scandal- 
ous. A very remarkable picture occupies p. 67 
of the first volume ; it represents a giant cactus 
of Mexico, clearly from a photograph, but some 
enterprising artist has added a drawing of a 
Mexican, on such a scale as to make the cactus 
seem enormously larger than it really was. The 
legend beneath states that the spines are long 
enough to be used as toothpicks, which is true 
enough; but they appear about as long as the arm 
of the man figured ! Such fake pictures ought 
not to be published. After making these criti- 
cisms, it is only fair to add that they have to do 
only with relatively minor features of an excel- 
lent book.

Chattel-ton Hill's "The Philosophy of Nietzsche: 
An Exposition and an Appreciation" (Appleton) 
reveals at once sublimated faith on the part of the 
writer and profitable experience on the part of the 
publisher. This revelation is much the more strik- 
ing since the manuscript of the book was finished 
eight years ago, and since but two of its thirteen 
chapters contain anything that would have been 
essentially new for the readers of 1905, and even 
these have been anticipated, if not superseded, in 
the meanwhile. All serious students of Nietzsche 
know that, heroism, sincerity, and refinement were his 
three most prominent traits, and that he looked upon 
the State, the moral law, science, and Christianity 
as exasperating hindrances in the development of his 
ideal class. An elaboration of these ideas, coupled 
with a brief account of his life, fills Book One of the 
present work. Book Two goes over the now hard- 
trodden ground of will, knowledge, master and 
slave, superman ; and compares Nietzsche with Max 
Stirner, after having appraised the former. It is 
these two sections that one reads with the interest of 
near-novelty. Mr. Hill finds Nietzsche and Stirner 
alike in their idealization of force, their belief in 
the will of power, their doctrine of the integral life, 
their faith in the preeminence of the voluntary over 
the purely ititellectual sentiments, and their exalta- 
tion of the individual. Both were individualists, 
Nietzsche for the sake of the race, his inferior pro- 
totype for the sake of the individual; while Stirner 
admired a Cesare Borgia as such, Nietzsche admired 
him as the type of a race to come. But with all of 
Mr. Hill's able comparison, it is a pity to see him re- 
ferring to such works on Stirner as those of Mackay 
and Rt< -hurt- and leaving S. T. Byington's classic 
translation (1907), with its excellent introduction 
by J. L. Walker, out of consideration. In this one 
respect at least, Mr. Hill should have revised his 
treatise to date. But with his general evaluation of 
Nietzsche no one will quarrel. It is a delight to 
read, at last, something sensible on Nietzsche's un- 
qualified denunciation of Christianity; it is helpful 
to ponder over Mr. Hill's discussion of genius which 
Nietzsche had and of erudition which he did not 
have; it is refreshing to meet with a sound exposi- 
tion of Nietzsche's personality, the most powerful 
stimulant against the corroding isms of the present 
day. Nietzsche cried out aloud both to those who 
were asleep and at ease and to those who were un- 
wisely energetic; and the echo of his cries may still 
be heard and heeded. It is invigorating to have such 
human reminders around, though too many of them 
would soon rob each one of his effectiveness. Albeit 
Nietzsche did not add to our stock of positive knowl- 
edge, he did increase our interest in the full life and 
the deep ideal. Mr. Hill has gone into this part of 



his study with uncommonly fruitful results. De- 
spite his fondness for such words as " hemiplegic," 
"unicity," "theorician," "diathesis," "nmoneism," 
words that perturb the linguistically trepid, the 
entire discussion is clear, thorough, and reasonably 
untechnical. And only once, in "Neitzsche" on page 
139, has the proof-reader seemed to nod. 



More paoes from The 8econd J m e <>f the " Diary of 
the diarv of Frances, Lady Shelley " ( Scribner) 
Lady Shelley, appears after the lapse of one year 
since the publication of the first, and takes up the 
story where the earlier one dropped it in the year 
1817. As Percy Bysshe Shelley was then living 
and writing his best poetry, and was only six years 
younger than the diarist, there is a natural expecta- 
tion that we shall be favored with some signs of her 
pride in his accomplishment. On the contrary, there 
is but one allusion to him, "my husband's young 
kinsman, Percy Shelley, who seems ditsposed to 
become a poet. When I spoke to Mr. Scott [Sir 
Walter Scott] about him he told me he seemed to 
possess great talent ; but I have no means of judg- 
ing of this myself, as I have not seen any of his 
productions." Yet this was the very year (1819) 
in which Shelley was writing the most radiant of 
Utopian visions, " Prometheus Unbound "; the great- 
est of tragedies since Shakespeare, "The Cenci*'; and 
the most perfect of English lyrics, the " Ode to the 
West Wind." There is also a copy of a long letter 
from Scott to Shelley, acknowledging the receipt of 
some poems submitted to the former for judgment, 
which contains such smug advice as this : " They 
are a little too wordy, and there is too much the air 
to make the most of everything. . . . Upon the 
whole, I think your specimen augurs very favorably 
of your talents. . . . But, above all, be in no hurry 
to publish* A name in poetry is soon lost, but it is 
very difficult to regain it." However, there is no 
lack of interest for the reader who seeks for glimpses 
of men who were helping to make history in the 
eventful years between 1817 and 1873. Lady 
Shelley was the chosen companion and acknowl- 
edged friend of the Duke of Wellington. Notwith- 
standing a temporary breach in their confidential 
relations, which was afterwards mended, he was 
always the object of her hero-worship. They ex- 
changed frequent visits ; on one occasion he draws 
for her a plan of the battle of Orthes, on the knee 
of his breeches ; for her, he consents to have his 
picture painted by Hayter, a reproduction of which 
now appears for the first time as the frontispiece of 
this volume. We learn of his devotion to his mother, 
notwithstanding that she used to snub him as a boy 
because he was shy, and had not the dash and charm 
which distinguished his elder brother. With Queen 
Victoria, Lady Shelley was on such intimate terms 
that the Queen stood by her death- bed, and it was 
to her that she uttered almost her last words, ' I 
should be completely satisfied to die, Your Majesty, 
if I might be allowed to kiss your hand." The seven 
illustrations are all new and interesting.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



The authorship of the rambling, 
of a restless amusing, always intimately personal 
man of leisure, inters published about two years 
ago under the title, "European Years," is now 
divulged in Professor Woodberry's preface to a 
second selection of letters from the same pen ; and 
the name, already an open secret, is Hermann Jack- 
son Warner. " New Letters of an Idle Man " 
(Houghton) will be found no less worth reading 
than the preceding collection, although a little dif- 
ferent in tone. As the editor of both volumes says, 
the later one " illustrates the subtle way in which a 
letter-writer responds to his invisible correspondent 
by an unconscious mood in himself, pre-established 
by ' auld acquaintance '; this packet is of a lighter 
sort, is more indulgent to whim and weariness, and 
an etymological interest takes the place of political 
economy." By reason of their greater indulgence to 
the writer's whim and weariness, these letters, which 
are all addressed to an apparently intimate friend, 
designated in print as " H," and, one conjectures from 
internal evidence, a Bowdotn professor, are even more 
frankly and carelessly revealing, in what they dis- 
close of the " idle man's " amiable personality, than 
were those first published. The second packet seems 
to have been brought to light as a result of the 
" rummaging in old desks" occasioned, Mr. Wood- 
berry says, by the publication of the first; and there 
is cause for satisfaction that the rummaging was so 
fruitful. From the autumn of 188 1 to the summer 
of 1899 the letters continue with few long breaks, 
the years 1884 and 1896 being the only ones left 
blank; and the writer's wanderings in those two 
decades were from Europe to America and back 
again, to Japan and China, India and Egypt and 
Greece, to the Bahamas and to England, with winters 
in Italy, summers in Germany, sojourns it Switzer- 
land, and other restless hitherings and thitherings, 
as Mrs. Carlyle might put it. The writer is the 
same companionable soul, the same lover of ease and 
good living, and as "far gone in indolence and 
pipes " as in the earlier volume. But he is always 
a wide reader, and he comments shrewdly and fear- 
lessly on what he reads. The "New Letters" will 
not disappoint the lover of epistolary literature. 

The abode of Richer and riper, more mellow, more 
gentle mirth and genially tolerant, more filled with 
tranquil thoughts tne ca i m w i e dom of life, and marked 
by even more abundant felicities of style than his 
former volumes, Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson's 
"Joyous Gard" (Putnam) carries with it an atmos- 
phere of tranquil mirth, of kindly humor, of sage 
reflection, of wise observation, and of large charity 
and good will, that makes it a book thoroughly 
wholesome in its stimulus, restful and yet persuasive 
in its non-insistent plea for the best things of the spirit, 
and always sane and quietly optimistic in its outlook 
on the great drama of human existence. The title is, 
of course, suggested by Sir Launcelot's castle into 
which, as is related in the "Morte d' Arthur," he 
retired for rest and recreation and pleasant dis- 



course when the exigencies of war and business 
permitted ; and the book argues the desirability and 
possibility of a similar stronghold of the mind for 
each one of us to seek in moments of leisure, in 
order thus to keep alive in the soul whatever of 
beauty and spirituality and intellectuality it can 
make its own. Not as a duty, however, is this to 
be regarded, but as a pleasure and an increasing 
delight. The substance of the volume is divided 
into twenty-seven short chapters or essays, all in 
the vein agreeably familiar to Mr. Benson's readers, 
but enriched with fresh thought, new incidents, apt 
illustrations. He makes the chief end of man not 
exactly that laid down in the Shorter Catechism. 
" For the end of life," he says, " is that we should 
do humble and common things in a fine and cour- 
teous manner, and mix with simple affairs, not 
condescendingly or disdainfully, but with all the 
eagerness and modesty of the true knight." Poetry 
he defines as * the discerning of beauty," whether 
the beautiful things be seen or heard or hidden 
deep in the mind and soul; a fine definition, but 
not likely to drive out those other narrower ones 
which are also needed. Deploring a certain disre- 
spect for knowledge in England, the writer makes 
this rather startling statement: "There is, indeed, 
a land in which knowledge is respected, and that is 
America. If we do not take care, the high culture 
will desert our shores, like Astraea's flying hem, 
and take her way Westward, with the course of 
Empire." And in the same mood he censures the 
English worship of wealth. In good round terms 
the author assails -'the detestable Puritan fibre" 
that induces a distrust of any discipline that is not 
dark and gloomy. But opinions and principles and 
theories are not the sole substance of the book ; few 
representatives of the studious life have Mr. Ben- 
son's store of personal reminiscence and fund of 
concrete illustration. 

Some fresh ^ ne ^ tne most curious characters 

chronicles of of that interregnum between Louis 
theReaency. XIV. and Louis XV. known as the 
Regency was the eccentric Duchesse du Maine, 
granddaughter of the Grand Conde*, daughter of 
the fantastic family tyrant Henri Jules de Bourbon, 
and wife of the illegitimate son of the Grand Mon- 
arch, who at one time had prospects of becoming 
Regent or even of reaching the throne itself. The 
miniature rival of the Versailles Court which Mme. 
du Maine established at Sceaux, while it had no 
political significance, does not lack a certain literary 
interest, involving as it does the names of Voltaire, 
Fontenelle, and other writers not yet forgotten. 
The vigorous and piquant memoirs and correspond- 
ence of a life-long member of the little Court, 
Madame de Staal Delaunay, have been culled and 
edited by Mr. B. S. H. Lombardini, and the result 
now appears in a volume entitled " Rival French 
Courts" (Macmillan). The life of Mme. de Staal 
was a strange and melancholy one. As a child she 
won the heart of a lady who pampered and cuddled

her for years, but who died in the girl's early 
twenties, leaving her entirely without means or 
protection. A whimsical notable, the Duchess de 
la Ferte", filled with admiration for the young wo- 
man's qualities of mind, set about securing her a 
place as lady of waiting with the Duchesse du 
Maine, but, becoming angry with her while nego- 
tiations were in progress, wreaked the most exqui- 
site revenge by obtaining for her a servant's place 
instead. The poor girl dared not refuse it, and for 
years one of the finest intelligences of the genera- 
tion occupied itself with menial service about the 
person of the " Queen of Sceaux." In the course 
of time, however, she rose to the rank and place 
for which she was originally intended, married a 
Swiss captain, and died greatly respected and ad- 
mired. The Memoirs show certain notable qualities 
of mind and heart in their author, a literary charm 
that ranks them with their better-known contempo- 
raries, the letters of Mme. 'de Se'vigne' and the 
chronicle of St. Simon, a gift of objective imparti- 
ality, a patient self-control which is more than ad- 
mirable, and a capacity for admiring and loving 
which under other circumstances would have made 
a beautiful character. The frequent harshness of 
judgment and the gradual development of a pessi- 
mistic philosophy are entirely explicable from the 
circumstances of a life of drudgery and ill-treat- 
ment, although it must be admitted that if the 
witty serving-woman had not found the life of 
courts absolutely necessary to her existence, she 
might have escaped and been happier amid quieter 
surroundings. The title of the book does not make 
it clear that the treatment is confined almost entirely 
to the private and literary Court at Sceaux, and 
deals very incidentally with the real Court at Ver- 
sailles. 

It has long been understood that a 
vast amount of valuable information 
and gentleman, for the stu( ient of history lies hidden 
in the archives of prominent English families. The 
Historical Manuscripts Commission has succeeded 
in bringing much of this material to light ; but many 
collections still remain unexplored. Some has also 
been published through unofficial agencies, chiefly 
as a result of the newer literary fashion which calls 
for extensive citations of documentary materials in 
history and biography. " Why may not the Life of 
Windham be written from his letters?" wrote one 
of his friends in 1831. The suggestion has recently 
been acted upon, and now we have such a biography 
in "The Windham Papers" (Small, Maynard & 
Co.). This work is in two volumes, and is made up 
almost exclusively of letters written by and to Will- 
iam Windhara, who was one of the more eminent 
English statesmen of the Napoleonic age, though, 
"by the irony of events, he is now best remembered 
as the successful advocate of bull-baiting." Among 
the correspondents represented in this collection are 
George III., Pitt, Fox, Burke, Canning, Castlereagh, 
Cobbett, and many more. From the confidential 



An English 
statesman 



letters of such men we should expect to gather much 
new information, and we are not disappointed. In 
1783 Windham entered public life as chief secretary 
for Ireland ; the next year he entered parliament ; 
ten years later he entered Pitt's cabinet as chief of 
the war office; in 1806 he joined the ministry of "all 
the talents" as secretary for war and the colonies. 
He was therefore for a long time in close touch with 
political affairs and in the secrets of the government 
during a momentous period, and his correspondence 
is a valuable supplement to the public documents of 
the time. But " high-souled Windham " (as Macaulay 
called him) was more than an official and politician : 
Lord Rosebery, who has written the Introduction 
to "The Windham Papers," says that he ''was the 
finest English gentleman of his or perhaps of all 
time." Such a man would have many interesting 
friends, and his correspondence has an added value 
in the light that it sheds on the lives and personalities 
of such men and women as Dr. Johnson, Fanny 
Burney, Mrs. Siddons, Lord Nelson, and others. 
Lord Rosebery 's Introduction is chiefly devoted to 
a study of Windham's character as a politician : he 
finds him a follower of Johnson and Burke, the 
one was his guide in religion, the other in pol- 
itics. As to the identity of the editor of the Papers, 
the volumes furnish no clue. A number of excel- 
lent illustrations, chiefly portraits, add much to 
the interest of the work. 



No one knows what the son of 
. Napoleon III. might have accom- 

plished had he lived; but the chances 
are that he would have had no more influence upon 
French affairs than that excellent gentleman his 
cousin, who succeeded to the Napoleonic Pretender- 
ship at the Prince Imperial's death. Empires have 
always ended by bringing ruin to France, and the 
gallant but hasty youth who sacrificed his life gratui- 
tously in one of England's dubious African quarrels 
would probably not have been able to induce his 
country to forget the past. However this may be, 
the Prince Imperial was a charming character, and 
his life and death are touchingly told by his old tutor, 
Augustin Filon, in a volume whose first purpose is 
evidently political, but which is not ostentatiously 
different from other sympathetic biographies with no 
ulterior motive. M. Filon's acquaintance with the 
Prince began when, in 1867, he was set to supervise 
an ingenious but wholly unsuccessful arrangement 
for giving the boy a public school education without 
exposing him to humiliation and danger by sending 
him to a public school, which very difficult pro- 
cedure was attempted by employing various lycee 
professors to visit him, assign the lessons which their 
classes were studying at tha same time, and give him 
a relative ranking along with the rest. Things went 
much better after the downfall of the Empire, in 
1870, had reduced the boy to the rank of a private 
citizen and allowed him to attend school in England 
on nearly the same basis as other boys. It is clear 



312 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



that although he was slow in developing, the Prince 
Imperial possessed both intellectual alertness and 
strength of character, and that the depreciatory esti- 
mate which the Republican press of France set upon 
him was dictated entirely by political considerations. 
He remained under the charge of his tutor until he 
graduated from the Woolwich Military Academy 
and entered the British regular army in 1875, so 
that his biographer was in constant personal contact 
with the Prince during the most significant third of 
his short life. Neither the interest of the book as 
a biography nor its value as political propaganda is 
heightened by the unpleasant pages in which various 
brave British officers, and not alone the question- 
able Captain Carey, who commanded the squad in 
the attack in which the young man was killed, are 
bitterly criticized for allowing him to meet his death. 
There are two sides to the question at worst, and it 
would have been better to obey the appeal of the 
bereaved mother: "Enough of recrimination; may 
the remembrance of his death join in a common re- 
gret all who loved him, and may no one suffer either 
in reputation or in material interests I who can 
desire nothing more in this world make this a last 
request." The volume is issued in handsome form 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

The perennial The soul of goodness in things evil 
problem of does not escape the discernment of 

the bov. President William De Witt Hyde in 

his book for educators and parents, "The Quest of 
the Best" (Crowell) ; observingly he distils it out, 
and though he affirms that "boys are by nature bad," 
he proceeds to show that their very badness is but 
goodness in the making. The six lectures in the 
book were delivered last May before the First Gen- 
eral Assembly of Association Workers with Boys, 
at Culver, Indiana. Their method of preparation 
was novel and effective. With the six members of 
" English 10 " at Bowdoin, for the year 1912-13, the 
topics to be handled were gone over and subjected to 
a sort of joint and several treatment in both writing 
and oral discussion, the result "in several instances 
being their [the students'] work precisely as they 
wrote it." Although Dr. Hyde has printed as the 
first sentence of his introduction the provocative 
announcement that "This is a book for the top shelf, 
out of the boy's reach," it is safe to say that not even 
the bad boy of his conception will feel irresistibly 
impelled to pluck and eat the forbidden fruit from 
that top shelf ; a first taste would be enough for him. 
In other words, the treatment of the theme is serious 
and scholarly, though not unpractical. Its six heads 
are: "Natural Badness the Germ of Goodness," 
"Artificial Goodness the Repression of Badness," 
"The Quest of the Best," "Missing the Best: Sins 
of Excess and Defect," *The Personal Motive and 
the Social Medium," and "The Birthright of the 
Child." President Hyde here again proves that he 
knows how to hit the nail on the head: his style is 
vigorous, his thought practical, his applications apt 
and telling. 



An out-of-the- An entertaining and informative 
wav corner book about a little-known region is 
of Canada. Mr> j onn Mason Clarke's "The 
Heart of Gasp< : Sketches in the Gulf of St. Law- 
rence" (Macmillan). Mr. Clarke's interest in the 
remote and inaccessible peninsula which the French 
call Gaspesie is primarily that of the geologist, but 
it is also that of a geologist who sees and is able to 
make us see the grace and dignity and significance 
of the gigantic cliffs that guard this rugged land, 
and the character of the kindly and hospitable 
fisher-folk whose villages cling to their feet. He 
tells us something, also, of the history of the coast, 
the landing of Jacques Cartier, the early missions, 
attempts at colonization, and the development of 
the cod-fisheries still the principal, one might 
almost say the only, industry of the Gaspe" shore. 
He describes the famous Perce" Rock, Bonaventure 
Island with its colonies of gannets, murres, kitti- 
wakes, and puffins, the marvellous peninsula of 
Forillon, and the sea-wracked Magdalen Islands. 
Altogether Mr. Clarke has told, with the charm that 
comes of genuine enthusiasm, the story of an out- 
of-the-way corner of Canada and of its unhurried 
and untroubled inhabitants. The tired worker 
seeking a quiet spot as remote as possible from the 
city, and content with plain food and simple sur- 
roundings, might easily go farther and fare worse. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The handsome "Imperial Edition" of Sir Gilbert 
Parker's collected works, which Messrs. Scribner have 
had in course of publication for some time past, is now 
completed for the time being by the addition of " The 
Judgment House " and a volume of poetry. From " A 
Lover's Diary," in the latter collection, Sir Gilbert has 
abstracted some twenty-five sonnets which have always 
been objectionable in his eyes; and has added, evidently 
rather reluctantly, " a book of youth and memory and 
impressionism in verse " entitled " Embers," which was 
privately printed many years ago. The eighteen volumes 
comprising this edition make a dignified and impressive 
appearance, and the writer who lives to see his work 
given such a setting may well be considered fortunate. 

" Psychology " seems to have become the preferred 
term for any sort of talk about human functions or 
attributes. In " The Psychology of Laughter " (Ap- 
pleton), Dr. Boris Sidis offers an assortment of things 
he considers funny, strung along on a thin thread of 
commentary. The commentary makes clear the author's 
ethical prejudices, but fails to indicate anything specific 
or fresh concerning the nature of laughter. The excuse, 
apparently, is that the book is intended to be " popular," 
but it is far from clear that there is any necessary rela- 
tion between popularity and inadequacy. Of the cur- 
rent theories of laughter, Dr. Sidis mentions Bergson's 
and Freud's. He disagrees with both, but offers no 
substitute of his own; and he ignores entirely or is 
ignorant of Sully's important " Essay on Laughter " and 
the work done in laboratories at California and Harvard 
on the nature of the comic and its bearing on laughter. 
One gets the impression that this book, like Moses's 
razors in " The Vicar of Wakefield," was made to sell.

NOTES. 



A collected edition, in five volumes, of Mr. Edmund 
Gosse's essays is being brought out in London. 

Mr. Galsworthy's new play, "The Fugitive," will 
soon be published in book form by Messrs. Scribner. 

" When Ghost Meets Ghost " is the title chosen for 
Mr. William De Morgan's new novel, which, by the 
way, is not to appear until early next year. 

Mr. Yoshio Markino, author of " A Japanese Artist 
in London, has ready for immediate publication a new 
book entitled " My Recollections and Reflections." 

An authorized version of Strindberg's novel of the 
Baltic Islands, " On the Seaboard," has been made by 
Dr. Elizabeth Clarke Westergren, and will be published 
shortly by the Stewart & Kidd Co. 

Two of the season's most important novels, Mrs. 
Humphry Ward's " The Coryston Family " and Mr. 
H. G. Wells's " The Passionate Friends," will be pub- 
lished this month by Messrs. Harper. 

Two immediately forthcoming volumes in Mr. B. W. 
Huebsch's valuable little " Art of Life Series " are 
" The Use of Leisure " by Mr. Temple Scott, and 
" Marriage and Divorce " by Rev. John Haynes Holmes. 
The need for a thoroughly up-to-date guide-book to 
Japan is about to be met by Messrs. Houghton Mit'Hin 
Co., who have in active preparation such a work, written 
by Mr. T. Philip Terry, author of a standard " Guide 
to Mexico." 

The announcement of an immediately forthcoming 
volume of poems by Mr. Arthur Symons, to be entitled 
" The Knave of Hearts," gives happy indication of Mr. 
Symons's return to literature, after an absence of several 
years, due to physical break-down. 

Jane Austen is at last to be given place in the " En- 
glish Men of Letters " series. The volume dealing with 
her has been prepared by Mr. F. Warre Cornish, Vice- 
Provost of Eton College. We understand that Mr. 
Clement K. Shorter has in preparation a book on Mrs. 
Gaskell for the same series. 

A new one- volume edition of the works of Tennyson 
is promised by Messrs. Macmillan. It will contain a 
specially prepared memoir of the poet by his son, the 
valuable author's notes which have hitherto appeared 
only in the " Eversley " issue, and a photogravure 
portrait from the painting by Watts. 

Among forthcoming books on the stage we look for- 
ward with interest to the volume by Professor Boyer 
of Princeton, on " The Villain as Hero in Elizabethan 
Drama." Professor Boyer, we are told, threshes out 
the problem of the influence of Machiavellianism on the 
Elizabethan dramatists, beginning with Marlowe. 

Three books of importance, not hitherto announced 
in these columns, to be published by Messrs. Harper 
this month are the following: " Familiar Spanish Trav- 
els," by Mr. W. D. Howells; "The Story of a Page," 
an account of the development of the New York 
" World " by Mr. John L. Heaton ; and " Miracles of 
Science," by Mr. Henry Smith Williams. 

Following their success with the English version of 
M. Rolland's " Jean-Christophe," Messrs. Holt & Co. 
are about to undertake an even more extensive venture 
in a translation of Andersen Nexo's Danish tetralogy, 
"Pelle the Conqueror." Professor Otto Jespersen is 
responsible for the English rendering; and the first vol- 
ume, entitled " Boyhood," will appear immediately. 



A revised edition of Miss May Sinclair's "The Three 
Brontes," originally published last year, is announced 
by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. A notable feature of 
this edition will be a new Introduction in which Miss 
Sinclair deals vigorously with the questions aroused by 
the recent publication in a London newspaper of the cor- 
respondence between Charlotte Bronte and M. Heger. 
Mr. Abraham Flexner's "Prostitution in Europe," 
the second of the series published by the Century Co. 
for the Bureau of Social Hygiene, will contain a full 
and detailed account of the operations and results of 
Europe's different methods of dealing with the problem 
of prostitution. Arrangements have been made in 
advance of publication for translation into French and 
German. 

Mr. Thomas Hardy's publishers have in active prep- 
aration a new volume of this writer's short stories, to be 
entitled "A Changed Man, and Other Stories." At least 
two of the stories " The Romantic Adventures of a 
Milkmaid " and " What the Shepherd Saw " have been 
published in pirated editions in the United States in 
separate pamphlet volumes, but these have long been 
out of print. 

The Laurentian Publishers is the style of a new Chi- 
cago publishing house, whose purpose it is to specialize 
in books by local writers. The initial publication will 
be " The Beginning of Grand Opera in Chicago," by 
Mr. Karleton Hackett, musical critic of the Chicago 
" Evening Post." This volume will contain a history 
of Grand Opera in Chicago during its first decade, 
1850 to 1859. 

A third and concluding part of the late A. Growoll's 
invaluable work, "The Profession of Bookselling," will 
be issued shortly from the office of " The Publishers' 
Weekly." This third part covers such subjects as the 
Correspondence Department, the Salesman, the Com- 
mercial Traveller, and the Old Book Trade; and the 
chapters dealing with these subjects show the same 
careful investigation, high ideals, and shrewd judgment 
for which Mr. Growoll always stood in the trade to 
which he literally gave most of the waking moments of 
his life. 

Lovers of verse will be glad to learn that Messrs. 
Macmillan are planning to issue a new volume by the 
poet who chooses to be known as "A. E." It will 
bear the title " Collected Poems," and will consist of a 
selection from " Homeward," " Songs by the Way," 
"The Earth Breath," and "The Divine Vision," to- 
gether with some new verses. The author has included 
only that portion of his work which, to use his own 
words, he would wish his friends to read. He has, 
however, made but slight alterations in the poems 
retained. 

Among the autumn publications of Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. not previously announced are the follow- 
ing: " Essays on Men and Matters," by Mr. Wilfrid 
Ward; "Carducci: A Selection of His Poems, with 
Verse Translations, Notes, and Three Introductory 
Essays," by Mr. G. L. Bickersteth; "My Art and My 
Friends," by Sir Frederic H. Cowen; "Lord Lyons: A 
Record of British Diplomacy," by the Right Hon. Lord 
Newton; "Shakespeare's Stories," by Miss Constance 
Maud; and a new and revised edition of "Painting in 
the Far East," by Mr. Laurence Binyon. 

On October 23 the new Graduate College of Prince- 
ton and the Cleveland Memorial Tower will be dedi- 
cated. The Cleveland Tower, which is built into the

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16 



Graduate College, has been erected by national sub- 
scription. On that day the Princeton University Press 
will publish in three volumes the Stafford Little lec- 
tures which Mr. Cleveland delivered at Princeton in 
1900, 1901, and 1904. The titles of the three vol- 
umes are " The Independence of the Executive," " The 
Venezuelan Boundary Controversy," and " The Gov- 
ernment in the Chicago Strike of 1894." On this same 
date the Press will also publish " The Graduate Col- 
lege of Princeton," by Dr. Andrew F. West, illustrated 
with twelve full-page drawings by Mr. John P. Cuyler. 

The prose romances of William Morris will soon be 
accessible in a cheap form, as Messrs Longmans, Green 
& Co. announce that they intend to issue them in their 
well-known " Pocket Library." In October will be issued 
" A Dream of John Ball," " A Tale of the House of 
the Wolfings," and "The Roots of the Mountains"; 
to be followed in November by " The Wood Beyond the 
World," The Well at the World's End," and The 
Story of the Glittering Plain." Early next year the 
series will be completed by the publication of "The 
Water of the Wondrous Isles " and " The Sundering 
Flood." 

The first number of " War and Peace," which is 
described as " a Norman Angell Monthly," will appear 
in England this month. Its object will be to meet the 
demand for a saner discussion of vital international 
questions and to spread the philosophy of " The Great 
Illusion." The organ will be strictly non-partisan ; it is to 
be published under the aegis of the Garton Foundation, 
of which Mr. Balfour is one of the trustees; whilst 
amongst its first contributors will be Lord Loreburn, 
Mr. G. K. Chesterton, Mr. G. P. Gooch, Mr. F. W. Hirst, 
Professor L. T. Hobhouse, Mr. Arthur Ponsonby, Mr. 
Stephen Reynolds, and Mr. Alfred Noyes. Norman 
Angell himself will contribute a regular column giving 
advice to workers in the movement. News from abroad 
will be a feature; readers will be kept in touch with 
what is being done by all the various peace societies; 
and current international politics will be subjected to a 
reasoned examination free from the slavery of outworn 
phrases and metaphors. 

An illustrated volume by Mr. Arnold Bennett, entitled 
" Paris Nights and Other Impressions of Places and 
People," heads Messrs. George H. Doran Co.'s autumn

A good way to discover the best binding is to send 
a selection of books, varying widely in qualities of 
paper, to different binders, sending some to 

CHIVERS' BINDERY, Brooklyn, N.Y. 

Then watch their service and discover whose 
bindings allow of the most issues in good condition. 

CHIVERS' BINDINGS have, with more or less 
success, been imitated in several particulars, but by 
no means in all. 

You can have the REAL THING just as low in price

CHICAGO AND THE OLD NORTHWEST, 1673-1835 By MILO M. QUAIFE 

This book is in scope and subject-matter a history. But in language and content it is as thrilling)? interesting as romance 
It is a history of the founding of old Fort Dearborn at the mouth of the Chicago River at the time when the modern metropolis of 
Chicago was but a wilderness hunted over by Indians. It describes the " Fort Dearborn massacre." the contest of the British and 
Americans for the Indian trade of the great Northwest, and the Tndian wars, massacres, and frontier experiences which figured in 
the development of Chicago. The work is the most absorbingly interesting contribution to the history of the Northwest that has 
appeared in years and contains much new material of great importance.

LONDON IN ENGLISH LITERATURE By PERCY H. BOYNTON. 

The purpose of this book is new. namely: to give an idea of London atmosphere in the various literary periods, to expound 
the chief places of interest for successive generations, and to make a reasonably generous selection from old and new engravings 
and photographs. It seeks to make clear to the average and casual reader the allusions with which English literature is filled: 
The chapters are devoted successively to the London of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Addison. Johnson. Lamb and 
Byron, Dickens, Victorian London, and contemporary London. A list of illustrative readings is appended to each chapter. 
There are an appendix on illustrative novels, a complete index, and 40 full-page illustrations.

A MANUAL FOR WRITERS By JOHN M. MANLY and JOHN A. POWELL 

A book designed to aid authors and all others who are concerned with the writing of English. It aims to answer the practi 
cal questions that constantly arise in the preparation of manuscripts for the printer, business letters, and any sort of composition 
where correctness of form is an important element. 

It treats in a clear and convenient way the matters of grammar, spelling, and general form which writers need moft to be 
informed about, and gives full directions on the preparation of "copy" for the printer and the correcting of proof. The chapter 
on letter-writing is unique and gives just the help that is constantly wanted and that other manuals deny.

COSMO HAMILTON in the New York Sun: " A new novelist who is an old

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT 



And Other Stories These tales, in each of which a child appears, are for adults, 
and contain dramatic and at times tragic episodes, not usually associated with stories 
about children. There is also much humor. The publishers feel confident that the 
qualities of this author are unusual and remarkable 
enough to win a hearing. The author's earlier " Cayby- 
gan," "The Freshman," etc., have been highly 
commended by high authorities. $1-25 net.

MOTHER'S SON 



By the author of " The Fighting Blade." The Boston 
Transcript said of the author's "Allison's Lad": " Her 
technical mastery is great, but her spiritual mastery is 
greater. For this book lives in the memory." In her 
new novel, she has drawn the notable portrait of a lovable 
hero, full of the glamor and fancy of his German Father- 
land, and tells how her "toy soldier," brave, wistful, 
and humorous, was redeemed in the New World. The 
heroine is the well-liked " Betty-Bide-at-Home " now 
grown to woman's estate. Dramatic events are not lack- 
ing, and the hero faces death more than once. Much of 
the action takes place in Boston to-day. $1.30 net.

ously, now lightly, but always vigorously, fearlessly, and independently ; The Fraternity of the 
Fields is the eyes and the ears of him who may not be with Nature in all her moods ; In Motley 
is a department of wit and humor, not mere jokes, but inoffensive pointedness, directed chiefly at 
persons in the limelight ; Letters to the Editors are really short articles that are written by the 
foremost authors and public men of our time. The other regular departments are no less interesting. 

Distinguished Author a Plagiarist By Lily Young Cohen 

Who is this man ? He is among the most widely read of British novelists ; he is perhaps the 
most distinguished living British dramatist ; one of his dramas is now being played in New York by 
two of America's most eminent actors. Yet one of his recent popular novels is a translation of a 
French novel that was published several years before this plagiarist was born. The deadly parallel 
convicts him. He is completely exposed, by name, in this article. 

The Walls of Concarneau By George K. Baker 

Broidered on the historical fabric of the struggle of the devoted Britons who held Brittany 
against the French for the young Duchess Anne, this novel, but recently begun, keeps the reader 
alert, with eyes wide and ears open, while the wild warfare of the fifteenth century, with all its 
clash of arms and clank of mail, rings from the pages, and sweeps the reader on irresistibly. 

Broken Lights By Mowry Saben 

Mr. Saben is among America's foremost essayists. Under the general title of "Broken 
Lights" his most noteworthy essays are now being published in NEALE'S MONTHLY serially. The 
titles of the various papers are " Some Modern Ways of Thinking," "A Criticism of Some Modern 
Ways of Thinking," "Puritanism," "The Right to Freedom," " Self-Realization, " and "Life 
Considered as a Fine Art." 

Brilla By Anna M. Doling 

This irresistible serial, the story of a lie, began in NEALE'S MONTHLY for September, and 
will run for several months. The Ozark mountains form a picturesque background for the figures 
that move through this striking American novel. Seldom is it the good fortune of a reader to find 
a story so absorbingly interesting, and at the same time so well written. 

Our Jungle Man 

The first of this series of highly important articles was published in NEALE'S MONTHLY for 
October. The relations of the white man and the black as they exist throughout the United 
States are discussed with the utmost freedom in this series by prominent members of both the Cau- 
casian and the Negro races. Among the Caucasian writers are Prof. Thomas Pearce Bailey and 
Prof. Berrien Beverley ; among the Negro writers are Prof. Kelly Miller and Major John R. Lynch. 
No more notable series of articles has ever been published in NEALE'S MONTHLY. 

Into the Sunset By Edward S. Van Zile 

In this novel, which still has several months to run, Columbus is the great central figure. How- 
ever, Mr. Van Zile tells of the romantic career of the first Irishman to reach the new world. He 
came with Columbus, and so did another young man, and so did two girls. Mr. Van Zile is the 
author of several highly successful historical novels. 

Short fiction and various timely and interesting articles, besides the features enumerated above, 
will make NEALE'S MONTHLY for November noteworthy among American magazines. 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every number contains more 
than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain less than 128 pages. In its mechanical 
appointments no magazine in existence is its superior.

A TRILOGY upon a Theme 
Vital to the HUMAN RACE 

THE TRUE THOUGHT OF MARRIAGE 
THE TRUE THOUGHT OF THE HOME 
THE TRUE THOUGHT OF THE CHILD 

By JOHN MILTON SCOTT 
Price, 1 5 cts. per copy, or the three for 36 cts. 

TN this day and age, in which there is so much discussion, 
dissension and shadow thrown upon so important a subject 
as that of marriage and the home, this is a timely and worthy 
group of booklets. In them the author beautifully portrays 
the purpose, the truth and the sanctity of true marriage, 
the home and the child. 

Of the first The Christian Work and Evangelist says: 

"We wish such a little book could be put into the hands 
of every couple about to found a home. It is one of the 
most thoughtful statements on the subject that has recently 
appeared and sets marriage in snch a true and fine light as a 
beautiful opportunity to render an inestimable service to 
humanity that it cannot help but impress every reader." 
The other two are only just from the press.

IMPORTANT NEW FICTION 



New Novel by the Author of "The Inner Shrine" 
BASIL KING 



MRS. HUMPHRY WARD'S 
New Novel 



The Way Home The Coryston Family 



A book for the man or the woman who loves 
honesty is this new novel by the author of 
"The Inner Shrine." For that is what the 
very human hero of this story is honest in 
his hatred of pretense, honest in his wilful- 
ness, honest at last with himself when he finds 
that he has gone astray. He believed he had 
"gained the whole world" only to find that 
he had "lost his own soul." "In the best 
sense of the word a novel that will be dis- 
cussed," says The Philadelphia Press. 

Illustrated. Post 8vo. Cloth. $1.35 net. 



Admirers of this distinguished author's talent 
will be glad to know that she has returned to 
the style which made " The Testing of Diana 
Mallory" such a delight. First it is a love 
story, with a heroine who will rank as Mrs. 
Ward's most charming portrayal of young 
womanhood of to-day, then an absorbing rep- 
resentation of the dramatic struggle between 
the radical and aristocratic elements of present 
English society.

The Passionate 
Friends 

By H. G. WELLS 

The story of the turbulent lives 
of one man and one woman 
separated by the barrier of the 
law, yet attached by something 
stronger than any law stronger 
than themselves. A love story 
with a background of high ideal- 
ism and prophecy of the future. 
Vivid personalities, a love story 
which reminds you of the great 
love stones of the world, and 
the invigorating breath of inter- 
national movements make this 
novel the most important fiction 
the author has yet done.

A New Hardy Book 

A CHANGED MAN 

By THOMAS HARDY 

Here is Hardy at his best, a 
book to arouse the keen interest 
of every Hardy lover. This 
new volume has all the wealth 
of Hardy's genius, for the tales 
in it were written when he was 
at the height of his career. More 
like condensed novels rather 
than short stories are these 
tales, many of which are en- 
tirely new to American readers. 
"A Changed Man" takes the 
reader at once to Casterbridge 
and tells the romance of a cap- 
tain of cavalry. " The Waiting 
Supper " is a beautiful idyl 
of the Wessex country, closing 
with a quaint bit of Wessex 
superstition. "Alicia's Diary" 
is pure romance, the heart story 
of a stay-at-home girl told in 
her own words. Of the other 
stories, all are rich in atmos- 
phere and character, and sev- 
eral are almost mediaeval in 
their power and mystery.

CHICAGO AND THE OLD NORTHWEST, 1673-1835 ByMiLo M. QUAIPB 

This book is in scope and subject-matter a history. But in language and content it is as thrillingly interesting as romance. 
It is a history of the founding of old Fort Dearborn at the mouth of the Chicago River at the time when the modern metropolis of 
Chicago was but a wilderness hunted over by Indians. It describes the " Fort Dearborn massacre." the contest of the British and 
Americans for the Indian trade of the great Northwest, and the Indian wars, massacres, and frontier experiences which figured in 
the development of Chicago. The work is the most absorbingly interesting contribution to the history of the Northwest that has 
appeared in years and contains much new material of great importance.

LONDON IN ENGLISH LITERATURE By PERCY H. BOYNTON. 

The purpose of this book is new, namely : to give an idea of London atmosphere in the various literary periods, to expound 
the chief places of interest for successive generations, and to make a reasonably generous selection from old and new engravings 
and photographs. It seeks to make clear to the average and casual reader the allusions with which English literature is filled. 
The chapters are devoted successively to the London of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dry den, Addison, Johnson, Lamb and 
Byron, Dickens, Victorian London, and contemporary London. A list of illustrative readings is appended to each chapter. 
There are an appendix on illustrative novels, a complete index, and 40 full-page illustrations.

A MANUAL FOR WRITERS By JOHN M. MANLY and JOHN A. POWELL 

A book designed to aid authors and all others who are concerned with the writing of English. It aims to answer the practi. 
cal questions that constantly arise in the preparation of manuscripts for the printer, business letters, and any sort of composition 
where correctness of form is an important element. 

It treats in a clear and convenient way the matters of grammar, spelling, and general form which writers need most to be 
informed about, and gives full directions on the preparation of "copy" for the printer and the correcting of proof. The chapter 
on letter-writing is unique and gives just the help that is constantly wanted and that other manuals deny.

SMVA INDIGNATIO. 

Indignation is one of the noblest of passions, 
because it connotes a burning desire to right 
some enormous human wrong, a flaming resent- 
ment against some outrageous miscarriage of 
justice, a deep craving for the realization of 
righteousness among men. Wherever the weak 
are oppressed, or the fundamental liberties of 
mankind are endangered, this passion springs 
up in generous hearts, and impels them to fitting 
words and deeds in defence of the threatened 
palladium. It is to such hearts that the poet 
appeals when he says : 

" Whoso takes the world's life on him, and his own 

lays down, 
He, dying so, lives," 

and it is when he invokes such ardors that the 
poet fulfils one of his highest functions. But 
those to whom it is given to know this passion 
pay heavily for the endowment. For it possesses 
them as with the tearing force of the avalanche, 
or the devastating fury of the forest fire. The 
tranquil satisfactions and comfortable joys of 
normally-ordered existence are not for them, 
and their only hope of peace J that expressed 
by Swift when he wrote for his own tombstone 
the terrible epitaph : Ubi sceva indignatio 
ulterius cor lacerare nequit. 

If we were to expunge from the world's 
literature the note of indignation, the resulting 
impoverishment would be incalculably great. 
To the apostles of the discredited gospel of 
r art pour Vart the loss might seem insignificant, 
but it would be immeasurable to those for whom 
literature is no fabrication of the studio but a 
product of the laboratory of life, associated with 
every deep human concern, and allying itself 
with the great causes of religion and politics and 
the conflict between the ideals of individual 
liberty and social justice. What would Juvenal 
mean to us were he deprived of the temper 
with which he denounced the corruptions of the 
declining Empire ? What would remain of 
Swift were the burning passages of indignation 
stricken out of his record ? What was it but 
the note of indignation that gave Rousseau the 
power to impel a revolution of the social order, 
or Burke the power to smite the besotted con- 
science of a government intent upon the oppres- 
sion of the American colonies and thus recreant

to the hard-won principles of human liberty, 
with the passionate cry : " The question is not 
whether their spirit deserves blame or praise, 
but what, in the name of God, shall we do with 
it?" It was the indignation of Mazzini that 
unloosed the regenerative forces that redeemed 
Italy from the bondage of foreign tyranny and 
made it a nation ; it was the indignation of Hugo 
that opened men's eyes to the monstrous inner 
significance of the Second Empire and made it 
a loathsome memory of the past. As Lord 
Morley once pointed out, such writings are more 
than books, being acts, and it is the indignation 
which inspired them that gave them the vis viva 
of their irresistible impact upon what seemed 
to be the firmly established order of things. 
Shelley's Greek patriot hurled his dying words 
of defiance at the Turkish oppressor, 
" Then held his breath, and after a brief spasm 
The indignant spirit cast its mortal garment 
Among the slain dead earth upon the earth ! " 

And it was the driving power of Shelley's in- 
dignation, concentrated in such foci as " Queen 
Mab," " The Masque of Anarchy," and " Hellas " 
that made it possible for Brandes to say of him 
that his life, begun in August, 1792, "was to 
be of greater and more enduring significance in 
the emancipation of the human mind than all 
that happened in France" during that fateful 
month. It is, indeed, to the poets that we must 
go for the most impassioned and moving ex- 
amples of that indignation in whose presence 
wrong cowers and spiritual darkness is overcome. 
The last great voices of indignation in English 
poetry were those of Tennyson and Swinburne 
Tennyson with his : 

" Bring the old dark ages back without the faith, with- 
out the hope, 

Break the State, the Church, the Throne, and roll 
their ruins down the slope. 

" Authors atheist, essayist, novelist, realist, rhyme- 
ster, play your part, 

Paint the mortal shame of nature with the living hues 
of Art, 

" Rip your brothers' vices open, strip your own foul 

passions bare; 

Down with Reticence, down with Reverence forward 
naked let them stare. 

" Feed the budding rose of boyhood with the drainage 

of your sewer; 

Send the drain into the fountain, lest the stream should 
issue pure. 

Set the maiden fancies wallowing in the troughs of 

Zolaism, 

Forward, forward, aye and backward, downward too 
into the abysm." 



Swinburne with his : 

"Bow down for fear, then, England; bow 
Lest worse befall thee yet; and swear 
That naught save pity, conscience, care 
For truth and mercy, moves thee now 
To call foul falsehood fair. 

" So shalt thou live in shame, and hear 
The lips of all men laugh thee dead; 
The wide world's mockery round thy head 
Shriek like a storm-wind's: and a bier 
Shall be thine honour's bed." 

The indignation of Carlyle and Ruskin made 
a deep impression upon the thought of the Vic- 
torian age, and still evokes responsive echoes in 
the hearts of men who are wise enough to turn 
to those seers for guidance in the conduct of 
life. There is a sharp contrast between the in- 
dignant manner of the prophet of Chelsea and 
the prophet of Brantwood. Carlyle's indigna- 
tion was explosive, exceeding in dynamic quality 
that of most spirits thus aflame. A typical ex- 
ample is the outcry: "My malison on all block- 
headisms and torpid stupidities and infidelities, 
of which this world is full ! " Ruskin 's indigna- 
tion, on the other hand, was more petulant and 
passive, and tempered with a sad resignation, 
as of one who knew that his was a voice crying 
vainly in the wilderness, of one whose nature 
impelled him to testify, but who had little hope 
that his appeal would be heeded. We hear it 
in the opening of "Fors Clavigera": 

" For my own part, I will put up with this state of 
things, passively, not an hour longer. I am not an 
unselfish person, nor an Evangelical one; I have no 
particular pleasure in doing good; neither do I dislike 
doing it so much as to expect to be rewarded for it in 
another world. But I simply cannot paint, nor read, 
nor look at minerals, nor do anything else that I like, 
and the very light of the morning sky, when there is 
any which is seldom now-a-days, near London has 
become hateful to me, because of the misery that I 
know of, and see signs of, where I know it not, which 
no imagination can interpret too bitterly." 

In a word, Carlyle's indignation was angry, 
and Ruskin 's was sorrowful. Each, in its way, 
is capable of stirring us to the depths of our 
being. 

In our own national history, two causes, 
beyond all others, have fired with indignation 
the breasts of our noblest spirits. In the case 
of slavery, the passion of Garrison and Sumner 
and Phillips, of Emerson and Whittier and 
Lowell, brought about a triumphant routing of 
the powers of evil, at what terrific cost we all 
know. In the later case of the brutal subju- 
gation of a liberty-loving people, doubly shame- 
ful because it involves us in recreancy to the 
most fundamental of our national ideals, indig-

nation has not yet completed its task, but it is 
working in the national conscience, and the 
outlook is promising. Meanwhile, it is cause 
for congratulation that the noblest of our recent 
poets perhaps of all our poets was wrought 
to white heat by this monstrous wrong, and 
gave us one of the finest examples of indigna- 
tion in English poetry when he wrote his " Ode 
in Time of Hesitation/' 

" I dare not yet believe ! My ears are shut ! 
I will not hear the thin satiric praise 
And muffled laughter of our enemies, 
Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword 
Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd 
Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut; 
Showing how wise it is to cast away 
The symbols of our spiritual sway, 
That so our hands with better ease 
May wield the driver's whip and grasp the jailer's 
keys. 

" Tempt not our weakness, our cupidity! 
For save we let the island men go free, 
Those baffled and dislaureled ghosts 
Will curse us from the lamentable coasts 
Where walk the frustrate dead. 
The cup of trembling shall be drained quite, 
Eaten the sour bread of astonishment, 
With ashes of the hearth shall be made white 
Our hair, and wailing shall be in the tent." 

A certain amount of prejudice is necessary 
for the effective manifestation of indignation. 
We mean, of course, prejudice in the good ety- 
mological sense of fixed judgment determined, 
not by passion, but by a clear intellectual envis- 
agement of the evil in view, and of its probable 
consequences if permitted to prevail. The time 
for passion is after the judgment has been 
reached, not during the process of its formation. 
After that, indignation cannot burn too fiercely, 
or express itself in terms too severe. Prejudice 
in the bad sense is born of passion at the start, 
or at least of some unreasoning dislike, if not 
of some desire for personal advantage, and its 
causes will not bear close scrutiny. A great 
deal of spurious indignation, the outcome of this 
sort of prejudice, finds voice all about us, in 
religion, in politics, and in sociology, and often 
the utterance is so vehement that it deceives all 
but the few whose ears are trained to catch the 
note of intellectual insincerity. If ever the indig- 
nation of bias is justifiable, it is as a weapon in 
the warfare against the fanatic, whose own bias is 
so unreasoning that it would pull down the very 
pillars of the temple if by so doing it might 
accomplish its petty purpose. The fanatic is 
constitutionally incapable of "playing fair," 
and the workings of his unbalanced mind 
practically force the defenders of civilization to 



resort to exaggerated statements of their cause. 
Extremes of affirmation must sometimes be met 
by extremes of denial, and the spirit of calm 
deliberation which would gladly say : " Come, 
let us reason together," finds itself forced to 
abandon temperance because it is sure to be 
taken by the enemy as implying a confession of 
weakness. " Uncle Tom's Cabin " would not 
have ceased to be a mere book, and become one 
of the great facts of history, if its author had 
been willing to parley, and to weigh dispassion- 
ately the plausible defences of slavery that came 
from the rostra and pulpits of the Southern 
States. It was the virtue of that flaming fiction 
that it saw only one side of its subject, but pre- 
sented that side so intensely that the conscience 
of the nation was effectively aroused. 

It sometimes happens that indignation of the 
most righteous and salutary sort needs to be 
expended upon objects that do not seem at the 
time to deserve such reprobation. The philo- 
sophic mind looks far ahead, and realizes that 
eternal vigilance is indeed the price of liberty, 
which as a practical precept means nothing to 
the masses of mankind. It discerns the under- 
mining and corroding influences in thought and 
life when their destructive work is just begin- 
ning, and is up in arms before the multitude 
has taken alarm. To these watchers from the 
masthead the world owes more than it knows, 
and their indignation, which often seems dis- 
proportioned to its exciting cause, averts many 
a shipwreck of ideals. That wise man, Lord 
Acton, never wrote wiser words than when he 
said, speaking of the example of Washington 
and Hamilton in our national life : " It teaches 
that men ought to be in arms even against a 
remote and constructive danger to their free- 
dom ; that even if the cloud is no bigger than 
a man's hand, it is their right and duty to stake 
the national existence, to sacrifice lives and 
fortunes, to cover the country with a lake of 
blood, to shatter crowns and sceptres and fling 
Parliaments into the sea." 



THE NEW BRONTE LETTERS. 



On July 29, 1913, more than a year after the 
appearance of my book, "The Three Brontes," the 
editor of the London "Times" published, with 
every circumstance of advertisement, four letters of 
Charlotte Bronte to M. Constantin Heger all that 
remains of the correspondence. The originals are 
now in the British Museum, the gift of M. Heger's 
son, Dr. Paul Heger, to the nation. 

One of them is torn in two and mended again.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1 



It might have been more decent if M. Heger had 
finished his work of destruction (if it was his work); 
but since he did preserve the letters and they passed 
from his keeping to his son's, no other course was 
open to Dr. Heger than, in his own words, " to offer 
them to the British Museum as the official custodian 
on behalf of the British people." The responsibility 
for their publication rests with the editor of "The 
Times." 

The letters were written after Charlotte's final 
return from Brussels in February, 1844. They are 
dated respectively July 24, 1844, October 24, 1844, 
January 8, 1845, and November 18 (?), 1845. Ex- 
tracts from three of them are given by Mrs. Gaskell 
in her "Life of Charlotte Bronte." It is not known 
whether she had the letters in her hands, or whether 
she merely used such discreet selections as were 
given to her. Possibly Mrs. Gaskell may herself 
have made discreet omissions. As they now stand, 
unaltered and unabridged, they throw considerable 
light on that obscure and contested point of "tragic 
passion." So much light that, personally, I think 
they ought never to have been given to the world. 
But, since Mr. Spielmann has seen fit to give 
them, I am bound to unsay much that I have said, 
and to admit that some passionate element, inno- 
cent and unconscious, was, for all its innocence and 
unconsciousness, present unmistakably in Charlotte 
Bronte's feeling for her " Master." All that I wrote 
on this subject was written more than two years 
before the appearance of this additional evidence. 
I was then entirely justified in maintaining that, as 
far as "tragic passion" goes, we have no evidence 
to prove it, and that what we have points all the 
other way.* And if I said that tragic passion was, 
on the evidence, improbable, I nowhere said that it 
was impossible. Sir William Robertson Nicoll, in 
his letter to "The Times" of July 30, says: "It 
has been very seriously and ably argued that Miss 
Bronte's regard for M. Heger was nothing more 
than an ordinary friendship. To suppose it went 
further is 'pitiful and silly.' ... It will now be 
seen that those were right who took another view." 
You seem to hear a certain note of triumph, as if 
he said, "Aha! who was right and who was wrong, 
after all?" And it was necessary to remind my 
critic that I never said that Miss Bronte's regard 
for M. Heger was nothing more than an ordinary 
friendship, that, on the contrary, I was at some pains 
to show that it was a most extraordinary one. 

Well, I own that the now positively notorious 
passage about Charlotte's "peace of mind" may, 
after all, have referred to "Miss Bronte's regard 
for M. Heger"; and that when Charlotte says that 
day and night she finds neither rest nor peace; that 
if she sleeps she is disturbed by tormenting dreams 
in which she sees her Master, "always severe, always 
grave, always incensed" against her; when she says 
that the poor have not need of much to sustain them 
they ask only for the crumbs that fall from the 

* " The Three Bronte's," pp. 82-95. 



rich man's table, but that if they are refused the 
crumbs they die of hunger; and that to forbid her 
to write, to refuse to answer her, would be to tear 
from her her only joy on earth, to deprive her of 
her last privilege; and that when day by day she 
awaits a letter, and when day by day disappoint- 
ment comes to fling her back into overwhelming 
sorrow, then fever claims her, she loses appetite and 
sleep, she pines away, we have here the language 
of subconscious love-sickness underlying a perfervid 
intellectual passion. And if any room for conjecture 
yet remains, there can be no doubt as to Charlotte's 
state of mind when she assures M. Heger that his 
"deux discours prononce's a la distribution des 
prix de 1'Athe'ne'e royale" are worth the Pensees 
de Pascal and the complete works of Bernardin 
de Saint Pierre. 

But we have no business to read what she says. 
Her case raises a large question of literary ethics, 
of the public's "right to know," of the biographer's 
right to publish what was never meant for publica- 
tion. In the innumerable discussions that followed 
the appearance of these letters it was abundantly 
evident that to the ordinary decent man and to the 
ordinary decent woman Mr. Spielmann's act did 
not appear the fit and beautiful thing it appears to 
him and to Sir William Robertson Nicoll. Had 
any ordinary decent man found himself with these 
letters of Charlotte Bronte's in his hands, nothing, 
I think, would have induced him to give them to 
the world. He wouldn't have cared a rap about 
defrauding the public of its "right to know." He 
would have considered that the public has no right 
to know about Charlotte Bronte dead what Charlotte 
Bronte living would have died rather than make 
known. Of course, you have the notorious case of 
the Browning letters which may be pleaded as pre- 
cedent, but publication of even this unique corre- 
spondence was regarded by many scrupulous people 
as more or less an outrage against perfect decency. 
Still, it may be said that if the Browning letters had 
not been given to the world the world would have 
been considerably the poorer by their loss. They 
stand as the expression of a unique and perfect 
passion. You will not find in them one word which 
either Robert Browning or his wife could have 
wished not to have written. Whether they would 
have wished them to be published is another matter; 
but in no sense was Mr. Browning dishonoring his 
father and his mother when he gave their love- 
letters to the world. 

This cannot be said of the love-letters (if they 
are love-letters) of Charlotte Bronte. True, there is 
nothing in them dishonoring to the writer; but there 
is much which she would have wished not to have 
written. They are not the expression of a perfect 
love, acknowledged and crowned. They are the 
pitiful, almost abject cry of a passion secret, unac- 
knowledged, incomplete, such passion, as, with all 
its innocence, abhors publicity. To have published 
them simply as they stand is to have done their 
writer a gross wrong. To publish them with the 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



345 



accompanying editorial comments is to add insult to 
injury of the dead. Nor can I find in them any 
excuse for their publication. There is nothing 
unique about them. They are not, as Sir William 
Robertson Nicoll thinks, "priceless." They are the 
expression of a very ordinary love-sickness, writh- 
ing under its veil of intellectual passion. They add 
nothing of any value to our knowledge of Charlotte 
Bronte, even supposing that we had the right to 
know. 

Many harsh things have been said of Mrs. Gas- 
kell's indiscretion, and it may be admitted that 
where other people were concerned she was, even 
for a biographer, more than usually indiscreet ; but 
in all that related to Charlotte Bronte she was a 
perfect example of that loyalty which the living owe 
to the dead. As we do not know whether she had 
access to these letters, we have no evidence for sup- 
posing that she guessed Charlotte Bronte's " secret." 
But we can be pretty certain that, had she guessed 
it, she would have died rather than give it to the 
Press. This inability to do the indecent thing may 
make a poor biographer and a poorer editor that 
depends on what you consider to be the important 
truth about an author. Mr. Spielmann, referring 
to Mrs. Gaskell's extracts from the letters, says 
rather gratuitously that "they have inevitably, 
no doubt, at that time, for the biographer's peculiar 
purpose been garbled in a manner rare in a 
frankly and candidly conceived narrative," so that 
" the real burden and significance of the corre- 
spondence are thus ingeniously and successfully 
concealed." Now, if, as Mr. Spielmann admits to 
be possible, Mrs. Gaskell " had no part in it," if 
she " never had possession of the letters themselves," 
she was hardly responsible for the garbling. What 
then was her peculiar purpose? What was it that 
she so ingeniously and successfully concealed ? If, 
on the other hand, she did have possession of the 
letters, her purpose of concealment was plain. She 
suppressed, that is to say she discreetly omitted, 
all that she considered she was not at liberty to 
reveal. She concealed deliberately the secret which 
her sense of honor told her she had no right to 
know. 

But the modern editor is not worried by any of 
these scruples. And so, after all these years, we 
have Charlotte Bronte's poor little secret dragged 
into the daylight for all Fleet Street to gloat over. 
We have headlines in the papers : "Pathetic Heart- 
Cry," "Hysterical," "Six Months' Silence." We 
have a "Vindication of Charlotte Bronte'" by Sir 
William Robertson Nicoll. We have reporters 
interviewing biographers in the hope of extorting 
an opinion on the great discovery that, after all, 
Charlotte Bronte had a heart ; we have Sir William 
Robertson Nicoll and Mr. Clement Shorter both 
declaring stoutly almost too stoutly, as if they 
were champions of a lost cause that they honor her 
all the more for writing these letters ; we have the 
editor who gave her away protesting with a supreme 
stoutness that the secret he has exposed was entirely 



innocent, as if Charlotte Bronte's innocence was 
ever seriously called in question ; we have a tre- 
mendous display of chivalrous emotion all round ; 
and we have decent average people feeling nothing 
but the sickness of disgust. 

Mr. Spielmann in his leader says (and it sounds 
very noble) : " It is impossible for any but the 
stupidest to feel a prurient curiosity about these 
emotions which she has so innocently laid bare . . . 
to discuss them one needs a purity of thought and 
language equal to her own." 

This would be all very well if Mr. Spielmann had 
not drawn our particular attention to the fact that 
M. Heger had scribbled the address of his bootmaker 
on the margin of Charlotte's last and most passionate 
appeal; it is more than suggested that M. Heger 
was entirely indifferent to these outpourings; we 
are, in fact, invited to look on while an unhappy 
woman gives herself, with every letter, more utterly 
away, and to note well the coldness and propriety 
of Monsieur. We have Mr. Spielmann's most 
uncalled-for editorial rendering, " hysteric or neu- 
rotic," for " exaltfe," that word with which M. 
Heger in his "affection presque paternelle" is 
supposed to have reproved her. 

And so the real secret is out. It is not a vindi- 
cation of Charlotte Bronte at all ; it is a vindication 
of M. Heger. Under all the urbanity, all the pro- 
testing, all the manly chivalry, the reiterated state- 
ments of what was never doubted, the real motive 
is apparent. Dr. Heger, tossing back to the British 
public these torn fragments of Charlotte Bronte's 
heart, endorsed with the address of M. Heger's 
bootmaker, is not concerned with Charlotte Bronte. 
He is purely and simply defending his father. That 
bootmaker's address is to stand as a perpetual proof 
that M. Heger was innocent of any, even the faintest, 
response to Charlotte Bronte's " passion." 

Now, nobody ever seriously suspected either 
Charlotte Bronte' or her master of any attachment 
that was not wholly innocent. And but for the pub- 
lication of these letters the question might have 
lain over till the day of judgment. As it is, in try- 
ing to prove that his father was indifferent to the 
verge of brutality, it seems to me that Dr. Heger 
has tried to prove too much. He has still to explain 
why the letters were preserved ; why, in particular, 
that last letter lay in M. Heger's waistcoat pocket 
so handy for the bootmaker's address. Dr. Heger 
states in writing to Mr. Spielmann about the letters 
that "there have never been any others than those 
I send you." And yet Charlotte, writing in Octo- 
ber, 1844, asks M Heger if he heard from jfcer at 
the beginning of May and "again in the month of 
August." On the 18th of November, presumably 
1845, she says: "It is now the 18th of November; 
my last letter was dated (I think) the 18th of May." 
In the first of the four letters, dated July 24, 1844, 
she says: "Ah, Monsieur! I once wrote you a letter 
that was less than reasonable, because sorrow was 
in my heart. I will do so no more." It may be 
that this letter was never sent, but there are still 



346 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1 



three letters unaccounted for. And as the six 
months' regulation apparently did not come into 
force in the beginning of what Dr. Heger calls "the 
one-sided correspondence," we may presume that 
there were many more letters sent than he supposes. 
And we have still to wonder why Madame Heger 
disapproved of the "one-sided correspondence" so 
strongly that her husband had to propose to Char- 
lotte that clandestine arrangement which Charlotte 
very properly refused to adopt.* More than all, 
we are left wondering why, if the master sus- 
pected his pupil of a regrettable passion for himself 
(and it is more than suggested that he did suspect 
her), why on earth did he make that scene, described 
in one of Charlotte's earlier letters, when she was 
anxious to return to England, and he implored her 
to remain? That is not the conduct of an honorable 
man suspecting a woman's regrettable passion for 
himself, neither is it the conduct of a man altogether 
indifferent to that woman ; though it may very well 
be that of a man innocently unaware of the nature 
of his own feeling and of hers. 

And the theory of complete indifference is irre- 
concilable with the evidence of the letters them- 
selves. Can anybody whose judgment is not en- 
tirely warped by a theory really think that Charlotte 
Bronte, proud, reticent, self-distrustful to the last 
degree, the Charlotte whom we know in all her 
other letters, would have let herself go to such an 
extent, would have appealed so humbly, so almost 
abjectly, to a man whom she knew to be com- 
pletely indifferent to her ? If there is nothing dis- 
honoring in Charlotte's feeling for M. Heger, if, 
with Mr. Speilmann, we are to " admire her all the 
more for it," why should there be anything dishon- 
oring in M. Heger's possible feeling for Charlotte 
Bronte ? Why should n't we admire him all the 
more for it? There is nothing admirable in the 
figure that he cuts on the hypothesis of complete 
indifference. It is conceivable that he should have 
seen fit to end a rather trying correspondence on 
grounds far other than indifference ; that his feeling 
evaporated gradually, and that he became bored 
with Charlotte's letters, is also conceivable. What 
his precise feeling was nobody will ever know ; but 
that he began with indifference is contrary to the 
little, the very little, that we do know. 

What is more : on the total evidence I am con- 
vinced more than ever that until the moment for 
her final departure from Brussels, until the "scene" 
that M. Heger made, Charlotte had no "feeling" 
for him to speak of. I see no reason to modify any- 
thiifg that I have written in reference to the periods 
preceding her return to England in 1844. It was, I 
suspect, that scene that woke her up, that started 
the whole train of the longing that finds expression 
in the four letters, longing accentuated to torture 
by the loneliness and tragedy of her surroundings, 

* According to the statement Charlotte made to Miss 
Fastitia Wheelwright, he asked her to address her letters to 
The Athene Royale instead of to his home, on the grounds 
that the correspondence was disagreeable to his wife. 



longing that was finally appeased when her genius 
woke also and came into its own. 

However that may be, it does not, I take it, 
greatly matter. What greatly matters is the genius 
that appeased her ; and the publication of these let- 
ters does not affect in the least my main contention 
that that genius owed nothing to her " master," that 
(in spite of her brief obsession) it was independent 
of all that he could do to her or make her feel. 
The proof is the use, the deliberate and unimpas- 
sioned use, it made of him. 

You cannot have it both ways. If you insist that 
the figure of M. Paul Emanuel is a portrait from 
the life, you may measure the extent of her inde- 
pendence by her amazing mastery of the material 
at her hands. M. Heger may have been able to 
say, " I was adored once." But M. Paul Emanuel 
is the portrait, not of a god, but of a mortal, exposed, 
if you like, in all the charm, but also in all the 
weakness, the vanity, the pathos, of his mortality. 

MAY SINCLAIR. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE PURSUIT OF LEARNING UNDER DIFFICULTIES 
well-nigh inconceivable in this luxurious age is what 
we find in tracing the beginnings of Amerian scho- 
larship. Some of the " old boys " among our college 
graduates can even now recall the sufferings endured 
in poorly heated and dimly lighted recitation rooms, 
the bleakness of barn-like dormitories, and the 
insufficiency 'of appetizing food furnished at the 
college "commons." But no man now living can 
describe as an eyewitness the crudities of Harvard's 
first building, where the ground floor was devoted 
to academic uses, religious and literary exercises, 
and the purposes of refectory, kitchen, and buttery, 
while above were students' quarters, mere cells of 
the rudest sort. Though clapboarded and shingled, 
the building was far from weather-proof, and more 
air than light was admitted by the windows, which 
were only partly glazed, oiled paper serving else- 
where to let in a few of the sun's rays and keep out 
the "coarsest of the cold," as Artemus Ward said 
when he hung an old hoopskirt over his chamber 
window at a country hostelry in mid-winter. Not 
even the most rudimentary of table-equipment was 
supplied at the college eating- room. His own knife 
and fork were carried with him by each student when 
he went to dinner, and after he had finished he 
wiped them on the table-cloth. The first president 
of Harvard, the Rev. Nathaniel Eaton, could have 
given points to Wackford Squeers on the best way 
to abuse and cheat ingenuous youth. Even his 
usher, Nathaniel Briscoe, he nearly did to death by 
his brutal treatment. But he met with his deserts, 
being excommunicated by the church and ending 
his days in a debtors' prison in England. Mr. 
Arthur Stanwood Pier brings these half-forgotten 
details to our attention in his readable book, "The 
Story of Harvard."

THOSE WHO HAVE NO USE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, 
though the library stand with hospitably open doors 
in their very street, are -more in number than libra- 
rians like to believe, and more in number than they 
will be, it is to be hoped, a few years hence. The 
" Library Occurrent," issued quarterly by the Indi- 
ana Public Library Commission, says, editorially: 
" Once in a while a librarian is found who actually 
believes, or says she believes, that her library 
reaches all of her community that it can serve ; that 
everybody knows about the library, and makes use 
of it, or if he does not make use of it, has no use 
for it. Of course, no library's registration list will 
bear out any such statement, but the librarian of 
this type can explain away any questions on that 
score with a wave of the hand that 's the most 
important part of her reply and a statement that 
'the children all have cards and they take books 
home to their parents.' " Some significant figures 
from five Indiana cities with good libraries are 
printed, in proof of a too-common ignoring of one 
of the most valuable privileges open to the citizen. 
At Plainfield a little more than half the inhabitants 
are strangers to the library, so far as can be ascer- 
tained ; at Hartford City nearly three-quarters know 
not its benefits; at Muncie the record is about the 
same; at Fort Wayne more than two-thirds of the 
residents are recreant; and at Indianapolis not far 
from nine-tenths are equally blind and deaf to their 
own best good. In general, the larger the city, the 
smaller seems to be the proportion of card-holders 
and library-users. . . . 

COORDINATING ENGLISH WITH OTHER STUDIES, 
and thus making it appear less remote from the in- 
terests and tastes that govern a student's selection 
of the particular course to be followed by him in 
laying the foundations of his education, the English 
Department at Harvard is this year making an ex- 
periment that is thought to promise good results. 
Hitherto the twenty small sections in first-year 
English have each been composed of about thirty 
students, grouped together with no regard to their 
special lines of study. By the new plan, adopted in 
accord with President Lowell's desire for a greater 
coordination of studies, there will be but nine sec- 
tions, each section embracing a group of students of 
similar tastes and pursuits. Thus there will be four 
divisions of those taking courses in civil government, 
three of those following the call of philosophy, one 
of those electing history, and one composed of 
classical students. Assigned readings and required 
themes will have some reference to these several 
lines of study. At the same time, however, a partial 
continuance of work under the old plan will furnish 
means for comparing the two methods and for deter- 
mining whether the innovation is productive of the 
hoped-for good results. Professor Greenough, of 
the English department, says of the new plan : " It 
is hoped that by the new arrangement English com- 
position may be thought of as standing less apart 
from man's other studies than often seemed to be 



the case under the older plan. The mixed sections 
will not be given up or their number greatly dimin- 
ished unless the new plan clearly proves its super- 
iority. It has not been attempted before, so far as 
we know, and it will be very encouraging from every 
standpoint if it succeeds." 



A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OF ENGLISH LITERA- 
TURE, supposing English literature to be a teachable 
subject, is not to be found in every institution of 
learning. Dartmouth College was distinguished and 
fortunate in enjoying the services and the inspiring 
presence of one who seems to have been able to treat 
this subject pedagogically and yet not instil a lasting 
hatred of it in his pupils. Professor Charles Francis 
Richardson, who died on October 8 at Lisbon, N. H., 
in the prime of his useful life, is best known to gen- 
eral readers as the author of "The Choice of Books," 
which has given pleasure and profit to hundreds of 
young persons eager to know the best that has been 
thought and written by the great ones of the past. 
His "Primer of American Literature," his two- 
volume work on American literature, his novel, 
"The End of the Beginning," his book of poems, 
"The Cross," his "Study of English Rhyme," and 
the various products of his editorial industry, have 
had fewer readers. He was born at Hallowell, 
Maine, May 29, 1851, was graduated in 1871 from 
the college to which he gave the best years of his life, 
was editorially connected with "The Independent," 
"The Sunday-School Times," and "Good Litera- 
ture" in the years preceding his call to Dartmouth, 
and for twenty-nine years was a successful and be- 
loved teacher of his favorite subject at that college. 
Not even President Emeritus Tucker was more 
popular with Dartmouth men than was the professor 
whom they had long ago humorously nicknamed 
"Clothespins." A sentence from one of his last let- 
ters may partly indicate why he was so universally 
liked. "Somehow," he wrote to Colonel Melvin O. 
Adams of Boston, "the boys that you like, you like 
better and better as the fugacious years fly by." 

A SAD LACK OF GOOD BOOKS FOR GIRLS IS one of 

the manifold ills with which the modern world has 
to contend. This is not saying that the ancient 
world was any better off in this respect; its condi- 
tion was undoubtedly much worse, since there seem 
to have been no books at all for the amusement and 
recreation of either girls or boys. Miss Clara W. 
Herbert, head of the children's department of the 
Washington ( D. C.) Public Library, contributes to 
the Springfield "Republican " some of the results of 
her experience in ministering to the literary needs of 
girls, and takes occasion to lament that " at present 
there are hardly thirty girls' stories which add any- 
thing to her [the girl] mentally." She has found 
that "it is almost impossible to make the average 
girl read a story not laid in the present time and in 
surroundings and circumstances similar to her own. 
Historical tales, and those dealing with life in other 
lands, are not generally popular, as are the stories 



348 



THE DIAL

of school and neighborhood life, or those in which 
the heroine assumes charge of the family during the 
illness, or after the death, of one of the parents. 
Authors have learned that this is a popular basis for 
girls' stories. Thus the difficulty is to give to the 
girl books in sufficient numbers, satisfying this real 
need of hers and she will not read them unless they 
do meet this need in some way and still give her 
anything that will be stimulating intellectually." 
Thankful indeed must the writer of juvenile books 
be that the boy's craving makes him interested in a 
wider range of subjects: history, biography, travels, 
science, invention, and discovery may all be worked 
up acceptably in stories or other books for boys. Here 
and there, too, one finds a girl who has a healthy 
appetite for boys' books and turns away disdainfully 
from the Elsie Dinsmore series. On the whole, there 
seems to be a field open for arousing fresh interests 
in girl readers and for supplying the books that shall 
touch upon those interests in an attractive way. 

TRAINING FOR CITIZENSHIP, with all the aid that 
reading and lectures arid class-room instruction can 
render, is too obviously advisable to call for any 
argument in its favor on our part. Almost anyone 
ought to have the making of a good citizen in him 
if he is caught young enough and properly instructed. 
Our universities and colleges are of late paying 
increased attention to the instruction of their stu- 
dents in the duties of intelligent citizenship. At 
Cornell the regular work of the College of Arts this 
year includes a ''course in citizenship," in which 
non-resident lecturers will give weekly lectures, as 
will also members of the Department of Political 
Science, and Dr. Devine's manual on "The Family 
and Social Work" will be used as textbook. In 
the syllabus of the year's course are to be noted 
such lectures as that by Mr. Clinton Rogers Wood- 
ruff on "The Citizen and His Community," and 
that by Mr. Lee F. Hanmer on "The Citizen and 
the Recreation Needs of the Community," as also 
Mr. Clarence Arthur Perry's address on "The 
Citizen and the Schools," Dr. Hermann M. Biggs's 
discourse entitled " The Citizen and Public Health," 
Dr. Devine's treatment of "The Citizen and Prob- 
lems of Crime," and Mr. Franklin Matthews's lec- 
ture on "The Citizen and the Press." Much good 
ought to result from such a course as this, and not 
the least of the benefits accruing may prove to be 
the more general establishment of similar courses 
at other like institutions of higher learning. 

WHAT TO READ ABOUT JAPAN, in order to gain 
some adequate conception of the remarkable people 
who are causing so much discussion and debate in 
our own country and elsewhere, is a question at 
present asking itself in many an inquiring mind and 
getting itself voiced in many a bookshop and public 
library. The Japan Society, in reply to the great 
number of persons who appeal to it for suggestions 
in this department of reading, has prepared a short 
list of helpful and authoritative works. They are, 



as announced by the Society : '-Intercourse between 
the United States and Japan," by Nitobe ; " The 
Japanese Nation," by the same author; '-Ancestor 
Worship and Japanese Law," by N. Hozumi ; " Polit- 
ical Development of Japan," by Uyehara; "Japan: 
An Interpretation," by Lafcadio Hearn. Impoi-tant 
as are the works of native writers, and interesting 
as is the native author's way of viewing his sub- 
ject and expressing his thoughts, readers will find 
it profitable not to neglect the writings of western 
authors on Japan, who better appreciate the western 
student's difficulties and pointof view in approaching 
the subject. A foreign language is commonly best 
learned from one who, having i he same native tongue 
as the learner, has himself thoroughly mastered the 
language and not unconsciously assimilated it in 
childhood. So it is that Latcadio Hearn's and 
Pierre Loti's pictures of Japan are more intelligible 
to us than some other and perhaps more minutely 
faithful productions from a native hand. 



SIMPLIFICATION AND MYSTIFICATION meet and 
join hands, with the cordiality characteristic of the 
junction of extremes, in the pages of "The Pioneer 
of Simplified Speling," the official monthly publica- 
tion of the English "Simplified Speling Sosieti." 
The leading article in the latest number at hand 
begins thus: "Shoelderz tu the wheel! Aultnoe 
The Pioneer iz not isyud for tuu munths in the 
sumer, our campain goez on unbroecen. Indeed, 
tu jnj from the formidabl piel of pres-cutingz befor 
us (thai ar sumariezd in anuther colum), the public 
interest in our rnuuvment haz never been so ceen. 
Ever mor rair ar the contribyushonz tu the Pres 
that shoe complect ignorans ov our wurc and our 
aim/.; ever graiter iz the number ov thoez hu taic 
our sied." A little further on the editor takes occa- 
sion to "thane our well-wisherz for thair help in the 
paast. It wood be tuu much tu ecspect that aul 
wood be satisfied with ever! deetail ov our sceem, 
with every feetyur ov our propaganda." To an un- 
simplified speller a page of typographical contortions 
of this sort is not the easiest of reading: it mystifies 
more than it simplifies, although of course one might 
in time get used to such verbal puzzles as "ceen," 
"sceem," "jnj," "taic," "wurc," "tuu," and so on. 
In comparison with "The Pioneer," our American 
"Simplified Spelling Bulletin" is a hidebound con- 
servative in its treatment of the written language. 
If it were not for the English reminder and warning 
of what we may be coming to by sanctioning even 
the slightest initial license in spelling, one might 
turn from "The Pioneer" and hail with glad relief 
the " Bulletin." 

MR. HALL CAINE'S PROTEST against the exclu- 
sion of his novel, "The Woman Thou Gavest Me," 
from certain American public libraries, is an utter- 
ance natural to one who feels that he has put into 
the censured book all the resources of his brain and 
all the forces of his soul, as Mr. Caine expresses it, 
and who avows himself conscious of no unworthy

motive in writing the story. He says : " I specially 
desire to reach the large and sincere audience that 
depend for their literature on the great Free Libra- 
ries of your country [i. e. America]. I belonged 
to that audience myself in England in my youth 
and early manhood" which is a somewhat puz- 
zling statement if taken literally. "I only ask," he 
pleads, "that in judging a book let the basis of 
consideration be the aim of the author." And fur- 
ther: "Behind any book is the man who wrote it, 
and if he is a man of pure aims, and at the same 
time a true artist, he can teach a powerful lesson 
by an intimate study of any side of life, no matter 
how disgusting and revolting it may seem." The 
fallacy of that doctrine needs no demonstration 
here. The Manxman's appeal to the American 
librarian's sense of fairness is made through his 
American publishers, and will doubtless be printed 
in full in many journals. It is to be hoped that it 
will be read by all to whom it is addressed, and 
that it will receive due consideration. 

LIBRARY ECONOMY IN BOOKBUYING is a kind of 
economy every public library tries to practice, and 
the liberal discounts allowed to libraries by the book 
dealers help to make the book fund go as far as pos- 
sible. At Bristol, Connecticut, as we learn from 
the current report of its public library, the average 
cost of books bought during the year was kept down 
to a figure remarkably low, if the books were all of 
fairly excellent quality. The average cost per vol- 
ume is given as seventy-seven and one-half cents, as 
compared with one dollar and two cents at the Hart- 
ford Public Library, one dollar and fourteen cents 
at the New Britain Institute, one dollar and three 
cents at the New Haven Public Library, and eighty- 
four cents at the Waterbury Public Library. Pur- 
chasing orders were widely distributed, no fewer 
than forty-nine bookselling houses and individuals 
being called upon for one or more volumes each. 
In its percentage of total annual outlay devoted to 
book-buying the Bristol library far outstripped its 
neighbors named above. The figure attained was 
thirty-eight per cent, against thirteen to twenty-eight 
recorded by the other libraries. 



C OMMUNICA TION. 



MILTON'S EPITAPH ON SHAKESPEARE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I think it will be of great interest to your readers if 
you will kindly permit me to say a few words in your 
valuable paper apropos of the paragraph on pages 133-4 
of your September 1 issue, which 1 have just seen. 

" Starre-ypointing " has been the despair of English 
grammarians for more than 250 years. I am the chair- 
man of the London University College School, and our 
Headmaster tells me that as a boy he was catechised 
upon Milton's extraordinary blunder; because "y," like 
the German " ge," is never prefixed to a present parti- 
ciple, but only to a past participle. Lathoni and practi- 



cally all other grammarians were astounded that Milton, 
the most accurate of scholars, should have committed 
such an absurd grammatical error. So the matter re- 
mained until about six mouths ago, when I called atten- 
tion to- the fact that my copy of the second folio of 
Shakespeare's plays, 1632, contained an inserted page 
in which Milton's Epitaph is correctly printed with 
" starre-ypointed." 

I sent out enquiries all over the world, with the result 
that two other copies of the correctly-printed page have 
been discovered, one in the New York Public Library, 
and one in the library of Queen's College, Oxford. All 
the experts are agreed that " this page is evidently an 
original and contemporary print, not a reproduction in 
any modern sense. . . . The paper is contemporary." 
AVriting in " Notes and Queries," London, on September 
6 last, Dr. McGrath agrees with the above, and Col. 
Prideaux describes it as a " cancel leaf . . . printed 
after the book had been placed on sale . . . issued to 
purchasers in the same way as cancel leaves are occa- 
sionally issued at the present day." 

But I ask how comes it that after months of enquiry 
only two copies besides my own have been reported; and 
how is it that in the third folio of the plays, printed in 
1663-4, the ungrammatical word " starre-ypointing " 
remained uncorrected ? The answer is obvious. The 
corrected page could only have been issued to those to 
whom the preservation of Bacon's secrets had been en- 
trusted. The page reveals to us, and it was intended to 
reveal to us, the name of the real author of the plays, 
to whom Milton addressed his -Epitaph, the important 
part of which is contained in the first six lines (I quote 
from my own special page in the 1632 folio): 

" What neede my Shakespeare for his honour'd bones, 
The labour of an Age, in pile'd stones, 
Or that his hallowed Reliques should be hid 
Under a starre-ypointed Pyramid ? 
Dear Source of Memory, great Heire of Fame, 
What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name ?" 

Now " Reliques " must mean "what he hath left us"; 
and Ben Jonson addresses his noble verses of commen- 
dation, which precede the plays in the folios, " To the 
memory of my beloved the Author . . . and what he 
hath left us," meaning thereby the immortal plays 
themselves. And that is exactly what Milton means by 
" his hallowed Reliques." 

A " starre-ypointed Pyramid " can only mean a pyra- 
mid with a star upon its point (its apex ; just as a ball- 
pointed pen means a pen with a ball upon its point, 
a diamond-pointed drill means a drill with a diamond 
upon its point, such instances might be multiplied 
indefinitely. Now a pyramid with a star upon its apex 
is a " Beacon " (pronounced " Bacon," " Bacon great 
Beacon of the state," just as at that period "tea" was 
pronounced " tay," " sea " was pronounced " say," etc.) 

Milton then proceeds to say: " What needst thou 
such dull witnesse of thy Name ? " This is evidently 
intended to tell us that people ought to have wit enough 
to perceive that Bacon was the name of the all- wise, 
all-learned author of the plays, without it being neces- 
sary to put the dull witness of a Beacon (Bacon) upon 
these marvellous works. 

In quite a number of the books of the period, to 
which the name of Bacon has not yet been attached, 
there will be found engravings representing a pyramid 
or a beacon, to reveal to the initiated the name of the 
real author. EDWIN DURNING-LAWRENCE.

STAGE MEMORIES OF SIXTY TEAKS.* 

A follower of the stage in his boyhood, Mr. 
William Winter began writing about it in 
youth, and has been writing about it ever since. 
His biographies of Edwin Booth, Joseph Jef- 
ferson, and Richard Mansfield have found favor 
with readers, and he is now preparing a book 
on Sir Henry Irving and Miss Ellen Terry. 
These celebrities of the stage, therefore, are 
omitted from his present series of dramatic 
memories, "The Wallet of Time," as are also 
a considerable number of other noted actors 
and actresses whom he hopes to write about in 
a subsequent work. The two volumes now put 
forth are certainly not lacking in wealth of 
material; they extend to nearly fourteen hun- 
dred octavo pages, and are as rich in illustra- 
tions as one could wish. 

Mr. Winter's well-known heartiness of com- 
mendation for what he approves, and uncom- 
promising censure for what he disapproves, are 
to be met with in abundance in his comprehen- 
sive "Wallet" -a name, by the way, that he 
takes from the passage in "Troilus and Cres- 
sida" that begins, "Time hath, my lord, a 
wallet at his back. . . ." Whatsoever things 
are pure, lovely, and of good report, in play- 
acting, he stanchly upholds and warmly praises ; 
but for the follies and fads of the modern stage 
he has nothing but withering scorn and biting 
sarcasm. In the things of his profession he is 
a splendid hater of what he dislikes, a valiant 
champion of what he deems praiseworthy. For 
instance, he declares at the outset and nobody 
can dispute him that "administration of the 
business of the American Theatre, in recent 
years, has been characterized by a policy of 
covetous, despotic, sordid commercialism, which 
ought to be rebuked and steadily opposed." He 
takes pains to emphasize his belief as a dramatic 
critic that "ethical principles are more impor- 
tant than artistic principles," and adds : " The 
whole experience of my life sustains the con- 
viction that, while the dramatic artist, whether 
author or actor, should never undertake directly 
to inculcate a moral, it is the first duty of the 
critic to ascertain and declare the moral influ- 
ence consequent on dramatic expression." No 
such thing as "art for art's sake" enters into his 

*THK WALLET OF TIME. Containing Personal, Bio- 
graphical, and Critical Reminiscences of the American 
Theatre. By William Winter. In two volumes. Illustrated. 
New York : Moffat, Yard & Co. 



conception of the drama, as the drama should 
be. One sentence in his preface, more than all 
the rest of it put together, indicates the tone 
of the book : " It would be contemptible affec- 
tation on the part of any writer possessed of 
knowledge, experience, conviction, and trained 
literary faculty to pretend diffidence in writing 
on a subject which he is equipped and compe- 
tent to treat." 

After this we are prepared to find Mr. Win- 
ter's views of Ibsen and Ibsen's plays expressed 
in terms both vehement and picturesque. Some 
of the Norwegian's compositions he considers 
nasty, and all of them ponderous and dull. Of 
the principal character in "Hedda Gabler" he 
says: "A nastier little female reptile has not 
been depicted, even by Ibsen, 'whose spirits 
toil in frame of villanies,' and whose whole 
fabric of dramatic writing is a pollution to the 
Stage, a wearisome burden upon contemporary 
thought, a darkness to the eyes of hope, and a 
blight to everything that it can touch of nobil- 
ity, beauty, and joy. Perhaps such persons as 
Hedda Gabler exist: the Lunatic Asylum is 
the place for them ; not the Theatre. . . . The 
play of 'Hedda Gabler' is a long-winded, col- 
loquial exposition of disease, and its heroine is 
an insane cat. No other phrase can as well 
describe such a monstrous union of vanity and 
depravity." To Mr. Winter the author of 
"Mrs. Warren's Profession" is, in short and 
simple phrase, "a crack-brained, mischief- 
making English-Irish socialist," and the play 
itself a "nuisance." Other and even more 
remarkable specimens of Mr. Winter's caus- 
ticity might be adduced from his sprightly 
pages as where he says of the author of " The 
Christian" that he "registers himself as a 
blathering rhapsodist, flatulent with the wind of 
doctrine and giddy with self-conceit" but it 
will be better to pass now to his generous, 
whole-hearted, soul-stirring enthusiasm for what 
he admires and enjoys in dramatic art. Mrs. 
Gilbert, still agreeably remembered by many a 
theatre-goer, inspires him to the following 
strain : 

"She was a never-failing delight and constant moni- 
tion. Her sympathy with the young was deep and 
quick : she was always ready and glad to speak the 
word of genial encouragement to inexperience and to 
back it with shrewd suggestion and wise advice. In 
one expedient of acting, in particular, she was preemi- 
nently expert, the use of time. It was a technical 
education to watch and study her employment, in 
speech, movement, and gesture, of pause, rapidity, or 
deliberation. She never obtruded herself. Each of 
her performances possessed the invaluable attribute of 
seeming inevitability. What she did she made to seem 



1913] 



THE DIAL,

exactly right to be done, and as though, under the 
given circumstances, nothing else could possibly occur. 
To age she would not surrender, and she was indescrib- 
ably amusing, and often a little pathetic, in her politely 
brusque resentment of any intimation that she was old 
or required attention or assistance. ... As example 
of artistic cooperation, the ability and willingness to 
'play together,' for the right effect, without regard to self, 
I have seen nothing finer than Joseph Jefferson and W. J. 
Florence, in The Rivals,' and Mrs. Gilbert and James 
Lewis, in the Daly comedies. Mrs. Gilbert and Lewis, 
though they viewed each other with respect and ad- 
miration, were not close friends, and in their attitude 
toward each other, as age clawed them in his stealing 
clutch, they were comic. ' Poor old lady ! ' Lewis would 
say ; ' I 'm afraid she 's beginning to break up.' ' Poor 
James ! ' Mrs. Gilbert would remark ; ' he 's getting on 
getting on.' " 

Discussing the merits of a certain gifted 
English actor whose recent retirement from 
the stage his many admirers cannot but deeply 
regret, the author shows both himself and the 
object of his encomium at their best. 

" Willard's representation of Cyrus Blenkarn stamped 
him as one of the best actors of the age. His repre- 
sentation of Judah Llewellyn deepened that impression 
and reinforced it with a conviction of marked versatility. 
In his utterance of passion Willard showed that he had 
advanced far beyond the Romeo stage. The love that 
he expressed was that of a man intellectual, spiritual, 
noble, a moral being and one essentially true. Man's 
love, when it is real, adores its object; hallows it; invests 
it with celestial attributes, and beholds it as a part of 
heaven. That quality of reverence was distinctly con- 
veyed by the actor, and, therefore, to observers who 
conceive passion to be sensual abandonment (of which 
any animal is capable), his ardor might have seemed 
dry and cold. It was nevertheless true. He made the 
tempestuous torrent of Judah's avowal the more over- 
whelming by his preliminary self-repression and his 
thoughtful gentleness of reserve; for thus the hunger 
of desire was beautiful with devotion and tenderness; 
and while the actor's feelings seemed borne away upon 
a whirling tide of irresistible impulse, his exquisite art 
kept a perfect control of face, voice, person, demeanor, 
and delivery, and not once permitted a lapse into extrav- 
agance. The embodiment was a memorable image of 
dignity, sweetness, moral enthusiasm, passionate fervor, 
and intellectual power; but, also, viewed as an effort 
in the art of acting, it was a type of excelling grace, a 
beautiful personification of a noble ideal clearly con- 
ceived." 

Of course these passages of dramatic criti- 
cism with which the work abounds are largely 
if not wholly or thus one is left to infer 
culled from the author's published reports in 
the daily press, or from his unpublished notes, 
and so constitute a sort of patchwork rather 
than an organic and symmetrical whole ; but 
no other dramatic critic now living could have 
made a book covering so long a period and 
embracing so wide a range of experience, dis- 
tinguished by such grace and charm of style, 
and revealing so close an acquaintance with a 



host of actors of many lands, from the days of 
George Holland and the elder Wallack, of John 
Gilbert and Charlotte Cnshman, down to the 
present time. His collections for the enrich- 
ment of such a series of professional reminis- 
cences appear to be of the richest kind, and he 
scatters his treasures with liberal hand. An 
appendix brings together some remarks on 
" Ibsen and the Ibsenites," a chapter on "Ameri- 
can Actors Abroad, and How They 'Fail' 
There," and a deliverance on the subject of 
"The Theatre and the Pulpit." In the Ibsen 
article the reader is again made aware of Mr. 
Winter's very poor opinion of the Norwegian, 
whom he takes occasion to rate far below 
Charles Reade an unexpected comparison, to 
say the least. " A reformer who calls you to 
crawl with him into a sewer, merely to see and 
breathe its feculence, is a pest." With that as 
a closing specimen of the author's trenchant 
manner, we bring to an end this account of his 
memorable work. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



DISEASE ATSTD GENIUS.* 



We all have by heart Macaulay's brilliant 
parallel between Luxembourg and William of 
Orange, between "the hunchbacked dwarf 
who urged the fiery onset of France and the 
asthmatic skeleton who covered the slow retreat 
of England." Both, Macaulay goes on to say, 
would in ancient Sparta have been exposed at 
infancy. We remember, too, Charlotte Bronte's 
tribute to Nelson, "The little lamiter who 
wielded England's might on the sea." Whether 
great talent is a cause or an effect of disease 
and physical deficiency, the two things seem 
inseparable. Of course the light of fame brings 
out flaws which would not be apparent in ordi- 
nary people ; but still it is impossible to doubt 
that genius has to bear more than its share of 
such inflictions as insanity, nervous derange- 
ment, drunkenness, consumption, scrofula, and 
blindness. Does talent by its rapid absorption 
of life force throw off toxines which produce 
these diseases, or do the diseases by their irri- 
tant power produce talent? The chemistry of 
character and ability is utterly unknown ; and 
when the most modern fad, eugenics, pokes a 
clumsy finger into this mystery, it may produce 
unexpected results. Certainly, if the past is 
to be taken as a guide, a sane mind in a sound 
body is most sedulously to be avoided, if we

want to arrive at high spiritual, moral, or intel- 
lectual values. Once in the world a community 
set to work to breed men like prize cattle. For 
a time Sparta did produce a race of powerful 
fighting machines. But even in arms these 
never more than held their own with the intel- 
lectual Athenians. Pericles told his feUow- 
citizens, " We can do all that the Spartans can 
and many other important things." In the end 
the men of Laconia went down before the Mace- 
donian barbarians, led by the drunkard Philip 
and the half-mad Alexander. 

These considerations are suggested by Dr. 
Matthew Woods's book, " In Spite of Epilepsy," 
which contains studies of three great epileptics, 
Julius Cassar, Mohammed, and Lord Byron. 
Dr. Woods's treatment of these three cases from 
the medical standpoint is of the briefest, and his 
sketches are really illuminating essays in biog- 
raphy. But he offers them to show the great 
army of epileptics that epilepsy, in appearance 
at least one of the most frightful of diseases, 
need not prevent a long life and an important 
career. 

Dr. Woods is a promising recruit for the 
small group of Americans who know how to 
write. He apologizes because his work has been 
done in the hurried intervals of professional 
occupation. Truth to say, good proofreading 
would have removed a number of misprints and 
errors of reference. It might also have reformed 
some of the sentences which have lost their right 
grammatical alignment, or which are wild and 
whirling in meaning. Occasionally, too, his live- 
liness becomes cheap or smart. But these are 
slight blots. He has that instinct for saying 
things which lifts writing into literature and 
makes books readable. 

The great cause which is being tried in the 
world to-day is that of Genius vs. Democracy. 
The people everywhere are refusing to admit 
the existence of superiorities. Hence what 
M. Faguet calls " the Cult of Incompetence." 
On the other hand, the trend of philosophical 
thought, in Europe at least, is as decidedly 
against Democracy. Democracy in art and liter- 
ature is certainly unthinkable, a contradiction 
in terms. These things are of and for the few, 
the many simply do not know what to make of 
them ; only in their weakest or most utilitarian 
forms do they appeal widely. So powerful in 
America, however, is the set of the democratic 
current that nothing can make head against it. 
Preachers, professors, politicians, presidents, 
all, like the Sausage Seller in Aristophanes, 
bring their sweet little honey-cake to the great 



Demos. They return in flattery what they get 
in pay. If an infinitesimal part of the effort and 
expense which with us have gone to make the 
intellectual halt half-whole or the intellectual 
blind capable of groping, had been given to 
develop promising talent, we should be to-day 
all one blaze of glory. But our motto has been, 
" Let us rally round our mediocrities, for our 
geniuses can take care of themselves." These 
things are spoken of here because Dr. Woods 
is decidedly on the side of genius, and he devotes 
himself to great fames with an enthusiasm which 
is rare enough in our arid life. 

His sketch of Ceesar is the slightest and most 
negligible part of his book. This is natural 
enough ; for while it is possible to add a stone 
to the mountainous cairn already raised to 
Caesar, it is not possible to alter the outline or 
contour of that monument. With Mohammed, 
however, Dr. Woods has, in English, a com- 
paratively virgin field, and his admiration and 
enthusiasm for the Prophet has built up a 
memorial of great freshness and charm. His 
enthusiasm, indeed, reminds us of that story of 
Carlyle who at an evening party, after declaim- 
ing with great vehemence in favor of Moham- 
medanism, could not in starting to leave find his 
hat. " Perhaps," stammered Charles Lamb, 
" the gentleman came in a turban." Dr. Woods 
would entirely alter our conception of the land 
East of Suez, "Where there ain't no ten 
commandments, an' a man can raise a thirst." 
Probably he is more than half right, and the 
Unspeakable Turk is very much the same com- 
pound of human nature as the rest of us. 

We think Dr. Woods is wrong, though, in a 
number of points relating to Mohammedanism. 
It is a parasitic religion. It originated less, 
and has certainly less to say to us to-day, than 
any of the other great Asiatic religions Juda- 
ism, Zarathustranism, Brahmanism, or Bud- 
dhism. Mohammed took his central concept, 
the unity of God, from the Jews. He took his 
model and methods from Christianity. The 
later philosophy of the creed was Greek. Avi- 
cenna and Averrhoes were followers of Plato 
and Aristotle. Schoolmen born out of place. 
Again, Dr. Woods seems to think that Moham- 
medanism is all of a piece, that it has held to 
the original tenets of its founder. In the gen- 
eration succeeding Mohammed there was a great 
split in the religion which endures to-day. And 
it is probably divided into as many minor sects 
as Christianity. That Mussulmans conform more 
closely than Christians to the moral teachings 
of their faith seems to be another conviction of 



1913]

Dr. Woods. Judging from their history and 
literature, they could give the Christians meal 
for their malt in all matters of immorality. It 
would be pretty hard to find any Western book 
which can beat the Arabian Nights in indecency; 
and Hafiz, Jami, and other lyric poets are free 
enough. Omar, translated, has become the 
bible of the bibulous. 

Dr. Woods repeats the statement that the 
Arabs saved Greek literature and philosophy 
for the world. To a certain extent they may 
have done so; but they probably destroyed a 
thousand times as much as they preserved. 
Omar's order to burn the Alexandrian library 
may be apocryphal, but something of the kind 
must have happened. The Arabs and their 
fellow religionists swept over all the regions 
which were centres of Greek culture. When 
they had done their work, only a few books and 
monuments remained to tell us what Greek 
civilization was. In spite of Dr. Woods's rose- 
colored view of the Mohammedan mind and 
character, we cannot believe that what they 
substituted was equal to what they erased. 

Dr. Woods's study of Byron, though largely a 
cento of anecdotes and quotations, seems to us 
one of the best presentations of that poet's life 
and character that has been put forth in recent 
years. It displays the good sense of a man of 
the world, and the acute knowledge of a physi- 
cian who can make allowances for Byron's un- 
fortunate physical inheritances. Particularly 
does it unravel that most remarkable trait in 
Byron's character, what might be called his 
hypocrisy of vice. From the beginning of his 
career he seems to have circulated defamatory 
reports about himself which were baseless. We 
believe that it is not uncommon for physicians 
to have to deal with a tendency of this kind, but 
Byron's hints and tales about his wickedness 
were u too tall." The thing, however, is easily 
understandable in a man of genius. Genius at 
first is geniality. It is frank, open, warm. It 
feels that it is great enough to be known as it 
is, to be painted with the warts. Then it 
looks abroad and sees how the average prudent 
human being hides his errors and failings, and 
in sheer disgust at such hypocrisy it blurts out 
ten times more than the truth about its own de- 
merits, and gives the eternal whipper-snapper a 
hold over it. Stripped of such self-imputations, 
Byron's character would not show any worse 
than nine-tenths of his contemporaries of like 
position. Dr. Woods rejects the charges of Mrs. 
Stowe and Lady Byron's friends, though he does 
not go into any disproof of them. Leaving all 



this aside, there was in Byron an energy, cour- 
age, and scornful strength of character which 
would have made him notable even without the 
splendor of his genius. The filagree poets and 
measurers of syllables have in recent times writ- 
ten him down ; but it is safe to say that he will 
outlive them, and rank with the great poets of 
the world. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



TRUMBULL OF ILLINOIS.* 



If the memory of Lyman Trumbull has 
waited long for formal biographical recogni- 
tion, it has at least fared well in the selection 
of a biographer. Mr. Horace White was the 
choice of Mrs. Trumbull herself, and of course 
the inevitable choice, since to high rank in the 
world of letters and active participation in the 
public life of the* time was added the advantage 
of long years of intimate acquaintance. With 
a voluminous store of personal recollections to 
draw upon, it would have been an easy matter 
for Mr. White to write a "life" of Senator 
Trumbull on very short notice ; but he has never 
fallen into that obvious temptation of a jour- 
nalistic career. For several years he has been 
patiently working over the subject, and the re- 
sult is a thoroughly adequate setting of the man 
in relation to his time. Many a well-informed 
reader will lay down this volume not merely with 
a new store of knowledge concerning Lyman 
Trumbull but with a broader and surer grasp 
of the essential facts and philosophy of the war 
and reconstruction period than he had ever 
before possessed. 

In his preface, the author makes the admis- 
sion that the careful study which the composition 
of this book has forced upon him has convinced 
him that his views upon one important point 
had been wrong from the beginning. He is 
now persuaded that the reconstruction policy of 
Andrew Johnson was that toward which Presi- 
dent Lincoln himself had been working, that it 
was the true policy demanded by the situation, 
and should never have been departed from. Of 
course this does not blind his eyes to many 
errors in Johnson's course, and to those obvious 
personal defects which in themselves contrib- 
uted largely to the disastrous break between the 
President and his party. In his acknowledg- 
ments of indebtedness, the recently published 
" Diary of Gideon Welles" takes first place, and 
is pronounced "the most important contribution

[Nov. 1 



to the history of the period of which it treats 
that has yet been given to the public." 

When Trumbull entered official life as a 
member of the Illinois legislature, at the age of 
twenty-seven, those characteristics which stood 
out in his later senatorial career were already 
well marked. 

" His style of speaking was devoid of ornament, but 
logical, clear-cut, and dignified, and it bore the stamp 
of sincerity. He had a well-furnished mind, and was 
never at a loss for words. Nor was he ever intimidated 
by the number or the prestige of his opponents. He 
possessed calm intellectual courage, and he never de- 
clined a challenge to debate; but his manner toward his 
opponents was always that of a high-bred gentleman." 

As a debater, one sees in this description his 
close affinity with Fessenden, of Maine, with 
whom his name became so closely linked by the 
vicissitudes of the impeachment of President 
Johnson. The two were not always in harmony, 
but they were alike in keen intellectual vigor 
and rugged honesty of act and purpose. When 
the death of Fessenden was announced in the 
Senate, Trumbull said of him : " As a debater 
engaged in the current business of legislation, 
the Senate has not had his equal in my time. No 
man could detect a sophistry or perceive a scheme 
or job quicker than he, and none possessed the 
power to expose it more effectually. He was a 
practical, matter-of-fact man, utterly abhorring 
all show, pretension, and humbug." Mr. White's 
comment at this point is that with Fessenden 
passed away "the most clairvoyant mind, joined 
to the most sterling character, that the State of 
Maine ever contributed to the national coun- 
cils." After all, what is the lasting worth of the 
glamour that later gathered around the person 
of Maine's "plumed knight," or her "Czar," in 
comparison with two such judgments as these? 

While Trumbull was a thorough hater of 
slavery, a vigorous supporter of the Union dur- 
ing the war, and an active champion of meas- 
ures for the protection of the freedmen after 
emancipation, he never lost sight of the solemn 
duty of proceeding with due respect to official 
oaths and constitutional obligations. His feel- 
ing against the temptation to defy law in 
assailing evil is well brought out in a speech 
made when the Senate was considering a pro- 
posal to investigate the John Brown raid. 

" No man who is not prepared to subvert the consti- 
tution, destroy the government, and resolve society into 
its original elements, can justify such an act. No mat- 
ter what evils, either real or imaginary, may exist in the 
body politic, if each individual, or every set of twenty 
individuals, out of more than twenty millions of people, 
is to be permitted, in his own way and in defiance of the 
laws of the land, to undertake to correct those evils, 



there is not a government on the face of the earth that 
could last a day." 

And so during the trying years that followed, 
while he was generally to be classed with the 
more radical wing of his party, we nevertheless 
find him repeatedly holding back when his own 
judgment and conscience told him that the con- 
stitution, honestly interpreted, stood in the way. 
On this ground he firmly opposed the Ku-Klux 
Bill of 1871: "I am not willing to undertake 
to enter the states for the purpose of punishing 
individual offences against their authority, com- 
mitted by one citizen against another. We, in 
my judgment, have no constitutional authority 
to do that. When this government was formed, 
the general rights of person and property were 
left to be protected by the states, and there 
they are left to-day." At the outbreak of the 
war, he took strong ground against arbitrary 
military arrests, and later used his influence to 
bring the suspension of the writ of habeas 
corpus within due limits. And it was of course 
the same spirit that nerved him to stand firmly 
and successfully against the abuse of the power 
of impeachment in the case of Andrew Johnson. 
For putting blocks in the way of some of Sum- 
ner's more radical measures, he was angrily 
charged with betrayal of the cause of freedom, 
but that did not hinder him from coming 
strongly to the aid of Sumner when the latter 
was unjustly forced out of his position as 
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations, through the influence of President 
Grant. It fell to his lot to draw the Thirteenth 
Amendment, abolishing slavery forever from 
the United States and from all places under 
their jurisdiction, towards which the Emanci- 
pation Proclamation of President Lincoln was 
merely a preparatory step, of value in its psy- 
chological effect on public opinion in the North 
rather than in actually freeing any large number 
of slaves, which under the circumstances it could 
not do. The man who drew this amendment, 
says the author, "will never be forgotten as long 
as the love of liberty survives in this land." 

There are many points on which one would 
be glad to dwell, but there are other demands 
upon these columns, and their space is limited. 
Mr. White has rendered a great service in pro- 
ducing this book. The young Americans who 
are growing up to-day to control the destinies of 
this nation need the tonic of a clean-cut presen- 
tation of just such lives as that of Trumbull. It 
should be in every public library in the land, and 
discriminating librarians should exert themselves 
to promote its circulation. \\r. jj. JOHNSON.

THE KITTREDGE ANNIVERSARY VOLUME.* 

For many years now, when a notable scholar 
and teacher has come near the end of his active 
service, it has been the pleasant custom for 
his friends and pupils to do him honor by con- 
tributing to a volume of essays samples, as it 
were, of the scholarly accuracy and habits of 
research which the master has inculcated. Such 
a book, for example, was the " Miscellany pre- 
sented to Dr. Frederick J. Furnival in honor of 
his seventy-fifth birthday" in 1901; and the 
" Studies in Language and Literature in Honor 
of James Morgan Hart" published on his sev- 
entieth birthday in 1909. The Italian, Fran- 
cesco Torraca, was so honored; the Spaniard, 
Menendez y Pelayo ; the Germans, Sievers and 
Morsbach; and, in America, Professors Gum- 
mere, Putnam, and Toy to mention only a few. 

As a rule, however, these testimonies have 
come after a long generation of devotion to 
scholarship. The "Anniversary Papers" pre- 
sented to Professor George Lyman Kittredge 
on the completion of his twenty-fifth year of 
teaching in Harvard University are therefore 
somewhat out of the ordinary. Although twenty- 
five years of teaching is a respectable achieve- 
ment, Professor Kittredge, now in the full vigor 
of middle life, promises to be good for another 
quarter icentury of equally brilliant and faith- 
ful service. Both the volume and the occasion 
of its presentation furnish opportunity for a 
brief review of the developments in American 
scholarship and higher education which have 
made Professor Kittredge's term of service so 
noteworthy. 

When Professor Kittredge joined the Eng- 
lish Department at Harvard in 1888, graduates 
of American colleges were just beginning to find 
out that it was no longer essential to go abroad 
for graduate study. To be sure, Mr. Henry 
Cabot Lodge, one of the first of Harvard's 
Doctors of Philosophy, had taken his degree in 
1875; but in 1888 Harvard was giving only two 
or three Ph.D.'s a year, as against her present 
average of twenty-five or thirty. The astonish- 
ing growth of the Harvard Graduate School 
since, a growth paralleled in other universities 
all over the country, accompanied by an un- 
precedented demand for advanced teachers, has 
given Professor Kittredge and his colleagues an 
exceptional opportunity to leave the impress of

their personality, their scholarship, and their 
teaching upon hundreds of men who have gone 
from their work at Harvard into college and 
university faculties. 

Some of the changes which this last quarter 
of a century has brought are reflected in the 
volume under review. For example, every one 
of the forty five contributors to these "Anni- 
versary Papers " is a college teacher, and twenty- 
three of them represent sixteen institutions other 
than Harvard. If time had served, the number 
of contributors might easily have been tripled, 
and the list of institutions represented extended 
very greatly. The conclusion is obvious, that 
in America almost the only road to scholarly 
pursuits, of the humanities at least, is offered 
by teaching. With us, men of means who take 
to scholarship are likely either to find teaching 
positions or to become bibliophiles with a leaning 
toward fancy bindings and volumes whose rarity 
sometimes has little to do with their intrinsic 
importance. In America, men like the late Dr. 
Fitzedward Hall or the late Dr. Furness are 
exceptional. In England such men are and long 
have been numerous. The fact, of course, is not 
necessarily disparaging to us. It means, for 
one thing, that men of exceptional bent toward 
scholarship find a main opportunity for service 
in direct contact with younger students. But it 
means also that many an American professor, 
with exceptional ability in research, is forced by 
our educational system to spend much time and 
energy on routine matters, when he might be of 
more service to his generation and to his college 
if he could devote himself more entirely to study. 
We do need in this country research professor- 
ships, and funds for publishing the results of 
investigation. Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Car- 
negie have made a start in science. Who will 
help out the humanities ? 

Another comment which a glance at the 
table of contents suggests is that all but six of 
the forty-five contributors are Doctors. Of the 
six, the four A.B.'s are Professors at Harvard, 
and the two A.M.'s are at Columbia, and their 
degrees date back to near the beginning of 
Professor Kittredge's incumbency. Time was 
when a man might be too busy with teaching 
and research (as Professor Kittredge and some 
of his colleagues have been) to acquire a Ph.D. 
But* that day has passed in America, for the 
president of any little freshwater college may 
demand and get a Ph.D. to fill even an instruc- 
torship at almost any salary between $600 and 
$1000. This is not, however, the place to dis-

cuss various absorbing problems connected with 
this change ; it is enough here to note its com- 
pleteness. 

Another remark which offers itself is that, 
although all of the contributors to this volume 
are teachers, not one of the papers even sug- 
gests pedagogy. They are all, as we have said, 
samples of the patient research and the dis- 
criminating and acute appraisal of facts which 
have made Professor Kittredge's scholarship 
and instruction so stimulating. Lest someone 
think "samples" a disparaging word, let us 
hasten to explain that the papers range in 
length from three or four to fifteen pages, and 
that the subjects treated are necessarily either 
such relatively minor matters as " The Date of 
Hegetor" or an interpretation of "Des Tors 
D'Arcaise" (a phrase in the Old French "Alis- 
cans"), or else carefully limited discussions of 
one or two phases of a large topic, such as 
"The Modernness of Dante," "Johnson and 
his Friendships," or " Hamlet and lago." 

Another phase of the change which Professor 
Kittredge has had so large a share in is the 
broadening of the field of scholarly activity. 
Nearly half of the papers in this volume deal 
in one way or another with comparative litera- 
ture and the study of origins. Those who used 
to complain that doctoral dissertations prepared 
under Professor Kittredge's direction treated 
with too monotonous a frequency the minuter 
and more technical Chaucerian questions will 
doubtless rejoice to see that only five of the 
papers deal with Chaucer at all. The general 
reader would probably turn first to Professor 
Barrett Wendell's "Fantasy concerning the 
Epitaph of Shakespeare," in which the writer 
sets forth a quaint but practical reason why 
our greatest poet may have deliberately chosen 
to phrase his epitaph in doggerel. Of the other 
purely literary papers, one of the most search- 
ing and instructive is Professor Brewster's on 
"The Logic of Literary Criticism." Indeed, 
the variety of the topics discussed here testifies 
to the wide range of Professor Kittredge's 
interests. His pupils have drawn inspiration 
not merely from his thoroughgoing methods of 
research, but from his eager interest in and 
surprising knowledge of the whole field of lit- 
erature as well as philology. 

The volume is printed, after the American 
fashion, on paper so heavy that its comfortable 
perusal demands a Morris chair and a book- 
rest. It is almost as ponderous a tome as the 
"elephant folios" of the seventeenth century, 
which were kept in window recesses or chained 



(needlessly) on great desks. But the printing 
and the proofreading have been done with 
unusual care, and perhaps the book's imposing 
dignity is all one should seek.

NAPOLEONIC CENTENARIES.* 



The widespread ignorance of Russian history 
accounts for the fact that the events of 1812 are 
remembered in Western Europe and America 
almost solely because of the terrible disaster 
which overwhelmed Napoleon's army. The 
heroic attitude of the Russian people, the enor- 
mous sacrifices they made to repel the invader T 
and their grim determination to abandon all 
rather than negotiate with him on Russian soil, 
are ignored. The memories associated with 
1813 are, on the contrary, popular rather than 
military. The idea of liberation or national 
resistance, voiced in the stirring appeals of poets 
and philosophers and expressed in the desperate 
efforts of the German armies, commands the 
greater share of attention. Such thoughts have, 
doubtless, presided over the recent anniversary 
of the " Battle of the Nations " at Leipsic. 

The renewed interest in the Russian campaign 
has led to the republication, in English dress, 
of the earliest complete narrative of it, " Rela- 
tion circonstanciee de la Campagne de Russie," 
written by Lieut.-Colonel Labaume and printed 
in 18 14. During the campaign Labauine was 
with the Fourth Corps, which the Viceroy 
Eugene had brought from Italy. He loses no 
opportunity to praise the conduct of Eugene, 
while at the same time he writes bitterly of 
Napoleon, which has enabled the translator to 
give the book a new title. The special cause of 
the animus is probably the fact that the book 
was addressed to a Restoration audience. It 
was immediately popular, reaching a third edi- 
tion before the year was out. It continued to 
be reprinted until the publication of Scaur's

narrative ten years later. The story of the re- 
treat occupies only a small part of the volume. 
The flavor of personal experience is not so strong 
as in some other accounts, notably that of Ser- 
geant Bourgogne. The author has attempted to 
keep the balance between reminiscences and an 
exposition of the military aspects of the cam- 
paign. His explanations presuppose on the part 
of the reader more familiarity with names and 
places than can be expected a century after the 
event. 

Mr. Petre's volume on "Napoleon's Last 
Campaign in Germany " is opportune. Nothing 
in English presents with such painstaking exact- 
ness the complexities of the struggle. Indeed, 
the book errs, if anywhere, in the minuteness 
of its military descriptions. The narrative must 
be followed step by step with Mr. Petre's sketch 
maps in hand, otherwise the reader will be 
confused by the moves and counter-moves of 
battalions, brigades, divisions, and corps. The 
comments on the topography of the battlefields 
are instructive. They would be still more help- 
ful were they accompanied by photographs of 
the countryside, such as Mr. Petre has furnished 
in his other volumes on the campaigns of Napo- 
leon. The special merits of the book will be 
found in its new information in regard to the 
composition of Napoleon's army and in the 
illuminating remarks upon the causes of French 
failure.. Mr. Petre corrects the views current 
about the character of the army at the outset. 
He regards it "as a good instrument of war." 
The personnel of the cavalry was good, but it 
was weak in numbers. The army used for the 
operations after the armistice was not so good. 
The numbers of cavalrymen had been increased, 
but they were inexperienced. Mr. Petre's opin- 
ions upon Napoleon's conduct of the campaign 
are equally interesting. He thinks Napoleon 
was influenced in September and October more 
by political than by military considerations, 
acting as an emperor rather than as a general. 
Such considerations led him to cling to the line 
of the Elbe too long and influenced him to delay 
the order to retreat from Leipsic. Mr. Petre 
believes that Napoleon did not show the power 
of quick decision which he once had. Too much 
was left to subordinate commanders whose initi- 
ative, hitherto suppressed, was unequal to the 
occasion. 

St. Helena literature still accumulates. The 
most recent accession is the letters of Piont- 
kowski, a Polish officer who shared Napoleon's 
exile a short time. Mr. Watson, the editor of 
the letters, has prefaced them by a full Intro- 



duction and a "Biographical and Critical" sec- 
tion . He is evidently a devotee of the Napoleon 
cult. In his Introduction he labors assiduously 
to call in question the good faith of Forsyth, 
who fifty years ago published a History of the 
Captivity based on the Lowe papers and other 
official documents. A part of the critical sec- 
tion is given to a similar attack upon Masson's 
"Autour de Ste. Helene." Piontkowski's let- 
ters give new details about Napoleon's last 
days in France, but his account of the situation 
in St. Helena seems to have been written for 
political use, and even the editor acknowledges 
that it is not in all respects trustworthy. 

Dr. J. Holland Rose's study of "The Per- 
sonality of Napoleon" is the most important 
attempt to present a complete conception of the 
great man's characteristics since Taine pub- 
lished the first part of his " Modern Regime." 
The treatment suffers a little from the limita- 
tions of the public lecture. Much is said which 
would appear more naturally in a biography, 
but a sufficient knowledge of which could not 
be assumed even in a Boston audience. Dr. 
Rose's conception of Napoleon will, therefore, 
be found only by bringing together opinions 
dispersed through the eight lectures which make 
up the volume. Perhaps he would disclaim the 
intention of presenting his conception in a sin- 
gle comprehensive analysis. In the last lecture 
he says, " It is futile to sum up Napoleon in any 
one category." In the lecture on " The War- 
rior" only a slight attempt is made to explain 
the elements of Napoleon's strategy. The im- 
pression is conveyed by descriptions of two or 
three typical campaigns. The little that is said 
about strategy might as well be left unsaid. 
What real information can be gained from such 
a statement as " prompt advance in as great 
force as possible along the best line of opera- 
tions " was a fundamental principle? Almost 
any commander would try to do this ; but the 
question is, how? A military writer in a 
recent number of the " Revue des Etudes 
Napoleoniennes " argues that Napoleon had 
two methods: first, an enveloping operation 
upon the enemy's line of communications, when 
his own superiority was decisive ; the second a 
manosuvre upon the enemy's central position, 
with the idea of dividing his forces and beating 
him, if his army was larger. It may be unsafe 
to apply such formulas to so many widely vary- 
ing campaigns, but it is more satisfactory than 
to stop with vague generalities. The most pen- 
etrating observations on Napoleon's character 
appear in the lecture oh " The World-Ruler."

[Nov. 1 



Dr. Rose concludes that as a result of the 
astonishing successes of the early years Napo- 
leon suffered from a form of megalomania, and 
could no longer discern the limitations of his 
own work. In this later period the emperor 
would not listen to advice, and frequently took 
his wishes for facts. As a partial explanation 
of his earlier successes, Dr. Rose might have 
made more of the aid received from the extraor- 
dinary group of able men by whom Napoleon 
was wise enough to surround himself. Aside 
from his military abilities, Napoleon's genius 
seems to have lain in the driving power over 
men which he possessed and in his unmatched 
skill as an organizer. HENRY E. BOUKNE. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



Ian Hay seems to be only a part of the name of 
the novelist to whom we owe the pleasant diversions 
of "A Safety Match" and A Man's Man" two 
books of clean entertainment to which we have paid 
our compliments in the recent past. This we gather 
from the copyright notice of " Happy-Go-Lucky," 
the author's new novel, which records him as Ian 
Hay Beith. The volume offers us light-hearted 
comedy of just the sort the title would indicate. 
Dicky Mainwaring, the central figure, is an engag- 
ing youth whose acquaintance we first make in his 
university days, and the opening chapters, which are 
a sort of prologue to the more serious matter that 
follows, invite us into the company of a merry set 
of boys at Grand wich which seems to be Cam- 
bridge. Afterwards we are concerned with Dicky's 
great love affair, which runs counter to the plans 
which the family have made for him, but is saved 
from disaster by the determination which lies at the 
base of his happy-go-lucky character. He sees the 
girl mounting a bus, runs after her, climbs up beside 
her, and establishes an acquaintance. She is a good 
sort, but handicapped by a shiftless father, a vulgar 
mother, and a socially impossible brother. The 
family keep a lodging-house in Bloomsbury, and

when Lady Adela Mainwaring descends upon them, 
bent upon investigating the extent of Dicky's per- 
versity, we have a delicious account of their attempt 
to put on appearances. The bubble is pricked, but 
Dicky is no snob, and will not allow the girl to escape 
him. The story is no great matter, but it is kept 
alive at all points by the author's effervescent humor, 
which can make the most commonplace happenings 
rich in delight. His characters are real people, 
incisively drawn, and we would not willingly spare 
the least considerable of them. A more refreshing 
story we have not read for many a day. 

Mr. Hall Caine requires nearly six hundred pages 
in which to tell the story of Mary O'Neill, the 
heroine of " The Woman Thou Gavest Me." One 
hundred would have sufficed for all the story he has 
to tell, but the greater number permits him to slobber 
over his theme in the unrestrained and nauseating 
fashion that somehow seems to secure him a large 
following of readers. He draws his support from 
that subterranean or submerged public that is an 
eternal mystery to the critical intelligence, the public 
that is swayed by crude emotionalism, and upon 
which it seems possible to inflict any form of literary 
atrocity without incurring its resentment. Here is a 
book that will probably prove a "best seller," along 
with the lucubrations of Miss Corelli, Mr. Wright, 
and Mr. Chambers, and yet a book so offensive to 
anyone having the rudiments of good literary taste 
that its popular acceptance presents a problem in 
psychology that would have baffled even the com- 
prehensive sympathies of William James. In its 
essence, the story seems to be a plea for the sanctity 
of illicit love, a brief for adultery, and ari argument 
against the salutary laws by which church and state 
protect the marriage relation. Free-and-easy divorce 
is the ideal preached by so many of our moralists in 
fiction that marriage is fast losing, in the popular 
mind, not only its sacramental character, but even 
its validity as the essential basis of any civilized 
social order. It is the easiest thing in the world to 
construct such a situation as is presented in Mr. 
Caine's novel. Take an innocent girl, keep her igno- 
rant of the seamy side of life, give her a training 
which brings her to womanhood with a flabby will 
and no sense of personal responsibility, and tie her 
by the marriage bond to a libertine and a profligate. 
Then let life become to her a hell upon earth, and 
pile up the agony with all the devices of sensational 
rhetoric. Then let the man whom she should have 
married appear upon the scene, and pile up more 
agony as she struggles against temptation. Finally, 
let her succumb, desert her husband, and have ille- 
gitimate issue by her lover. This is the approved 
formula, and when properly worked, makes a power- 
ful appeal to the sympathies. Of course, the hus- 
band's brutality must be unmitigated, the seducer's 
virtues abundant and gloriously manifest, and the 
wife's saintly endurance carried to the point of 
heart-break. Thus the novelist " puts it over," ignor- 
ing only the vital facts that men and women are not 
as beasts of the field, that sacrifice is sometimes the

appointed agency of the soul's salvation, and that 
the social obligation is paramount to the most im- 
perious demands of the hot individual will. Mr. 
Caine has the whole evil argument at his tongue's 
end, urging all the old sophisticated pleas for mak- 
ing the worse appear the better reason, and failing 
only of his desired effect because of his capacity for 
slobbering, because of the almost incredible rawness 
of his style, and because of his inability to make of 
even his leading characters anything more lifelike 
than wooden dummies upon which to hang his dis- 
cussion. His own public will not be disturbed by 
such things as these, but will wallow delightedly in 
the trough of his slimy emotionalism, spiced as it is 
with bits of description as salacious as he dares to 
make them. 

Mr. Gilbert Cannan's "Round the Corner" stands 
clearly out as one of the most remarkable novels of 
recent years, a work of serious and convincing art, 
a picture of life having the vitality that creative 
genius alone can bestow. We understand that it 
has suffered in England, along with Mr. Hall 
Caine's new novel, from the sort of unofficial cen- 
sorship that is sometimes exercised by the great 
circulating libraries. This fact illustrates how indis- 
criminate censorships may be, for Mr. Cannan's 
sincere study and Mr. Caine's thoroughly meretri- 
cious performance are as far apart as the poles in 
every essential respect. The Caine novel splurges 
in every chapter and is distinctly unwholesome ; the 
Cannan novel is quiet, restrained, faithful to fact, 
and exquisitely artistic in execution. Mr. Cannan 
has got the trick of Mr. Bennett, and knows how 
to write of the most commonplace people and situ- 
ations in a manner to make them fairly glow with 
interest. Since "The Old Wives' Tale" we have 
read nothing so good in this kind. The novel is 
concerned, as the title-page informs us, with "the 
life and death of Francis Christopher Folyat, 
Bachelor of Divinity and father of a large family." 
The scene, at first laid in Cornwall, is soon shifted 
to an ugly commercial town in the north of En- 
gland, whither the clergyman removes and his 
family takes root. At first we took the title to 
imply that we had only to look "round the corner " 
to come upon just such interesting human revela- 
tions as are here made, but toward the end we come 
upon the author's own explanation, which is a shade 
more subtle. "Modern life is theatrical. Every- 
body is playing a part, because they are without 
understanding. Life for modern men and women 
is forever round the corner because they attempt to 
tackle their affairs with the minds of children, 
children who believe everything they are told and 
examine nothing. They play with everything. 
They can do nothing else. Unhappily, life is a 
serious business which yields its reward of joy only 
to simplicity, sincerity, and purity, or, if you like 
the old trinity better faith, hope, and charity." 
These words occur in a letter to the Rev. Folyat 
from his oldest son, who has left home at an early 
age, and returned with widened outlook to the 



family hearth. His coming "lets in the air," but 
it cannot completely ventilate the stuffy recesses of 
the family life. The father, weak and easy-going, 
is incapable of convincing his children of the rela- 
tive values of life, as of dealing with the problems 
that confront him as they grow up. The mother, 
petty, selfish, and sentimental, is worse than useless 
as a guiding and restraining force. So the children 
grow up like weeds, knowing only mean ambitions 
and having only sordid ideals; the girls are in par- 
ticularly sad case, because marriage is the only 
possible solution of the problem of life for them, 
and it proves a most unsatisfactory one. Mr. Cannan 
has set himself the task of portraying life just as it 
is, without gloss or romantic glamor, smoldering 
for its time in a deadening atmosphere, and gutter- 
ing out at last. His tale is saved from being unre- 
lievedly dismal by the objective way in which the 
facts are observed. We think that he piles on the 
agony a little too much, for the life of the Folyats, 
who have a fair social position, and means that 
remove them far from penury, could hardly be quite 
as miserable as the author would have us believe. 
The real fault, of course, is not in their material 
restrictions, but in their failure to realize that there 
is in the human soul a spring of inward joy which, 
if only allowed to flow, can sweeten life in almost 
aiy environment. This is the teaching implicit in 
this very fine work of fiction, and the artistic justi- 
fication for what may seem its over-emphasis upon 
sordid detail. 

"The Red Colonel," by Mr. George Edgar, is a 
story that impels us to draw upon the unliterary 
vocabulary for some such word as "corking" or 
"rattling." Either of those expressive metaphors 
will serve better to describe it than the more aca- 
demic forms of expression. It deals with the exploits 
of the Red Four, a company of international thieves 
and murderers, who put each other out of the way 
until only one of them the Red Colonel remains 
alive, to be tracked down and driven to suicide 
by the persistence of a young English physician 
turned detective. What we like about Waring, the 
physician-sleuth in question, is that his wits are a 
match at every point for the arch-villain whom he 
runs to earth, and that he is never guilty of those 
silly lapses from caution which, in most stories of 
this type, bring the hero into desperate danger in 
order that an escape by the skin of his teeth may be 
devised for him by the author's ingenuity. Waring 
keeps his head all through, and does not make a 
single false move. The story is of the most exciting 
description, sprinkled plentifully with thrills, and 
holds the attention breathless as it progresses from 
plot to counterplot and from complication to com- 
plication. It is, moreover, written in the English 
language, and spares us the thieves' jargon thought 
necessary by most writers to give realistic color to 
stories of this description. 

With his faculties still undimmed in extreme age, 
Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, in the latest of the long series 
of novels which have occupied him during the last 



360 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 



quarter-century, gives us a work which must be 
reckoned among the very best that he has written. 
Few novelists can so temper the results of observa- 
tion with the ripe wisdom of the philosophic mind, 
or bring to bear upon a fictive invention so wide an 
experience of life and so seasoned a reflective com- 
mentary. He uses in the portrayal of a character 
the method of life itself, revealing to us the traits 
one by one, as they are brought out by circumstance, 
instead of employing the method of the facile novel- 
ist, who usually gives us the character outline at the 
start, and works it out in detail according to the 
preliminary specifications. Dr. Mitchell, no doubt, 
has the preconception clearly mirrored in his mind, 
but he imparts it to us only piecemeal, and we do 
not shape it for ourselves until life has progressively 
shaped it into unity. Each new manifestation comes 
to us as a surprise, but in the end the parts are all 
seen to fit themselves together as they do in our 
acquaintance with an actual person whom we have 
known for years. In "Hugh Wynne" and "The 
Red City," he has vitalized the revolutionary and 
post-revolutionary periods of our national history ; 
in " Westways," he performs a similar task for the 
period between the days of Clay's compromise, 
fondly but fatuously expected to calm the waters 
stirred by the moral uprising against slavery, and 
the closing days of the cataclysm which well-nigh 
rent our nation in twain, and blotted out forever the 
black disgrace of the peculiar institution. "Long 
before the Civil War," he says, "there were in the 
middle states, near to or remote from great centres, 
villages where the social division of classes was 
tacitly accepted. In or near these towns one or 
more families were continuously important on ac- 
count of wealth or because of historic position, gener- 
ations of social training, and constant relation to the 
larger world. They came by degrees to constitute 
what I may describe as an indistinct caste, for a long 
time accepted as such by their less fortune-favoured 
neighbors." Such a village is Westways, on the 
western slope of the Alleghanies in Pennsylvania, 
and such a family are the Penhallows, James, landed 
proprietor, ironmaster, and retired army officer, and 
his wife Ann, an aristocratic daughter of Maryland. 
The young people of the novel are John Penhallow 
and Leila Grey, James Penhallow's wards, and 
respectively his nephew and niece : John, orphaned 
by his mother's death in Switzerland, comes to live 
with his guardian in 1855, at the age of fifteen, and 
here the story begins. It is at first concerned with 
the making of this formal and self-conscious lad into 
a sturdy young American, and later with his life at 
West Point and his career as an engineer in the 
Civil War. The matters of historical import that 
are reflected in the ante-bellum chapters of the novel 
are the growth of the new Republican Party, the 
campaign of Buchanan and Fre'mont in 1856, the 
intense feeling aroused by the Fugitive Slave Law, 
and John Brown's insensate raid. Then we are 
carried all through the war, from the attack upon 
Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox, and the 



figures of Lincoln, Grant, and Stanton flit for 
moments across the pages. The relations of the 
Penhallows, husband and wife, are set at odds by 
politics, Ann being a stout partisan of Buchanan 
and a sincere believer in slavery, James coming 
more and more to feel that in the party of Fre'mont 
and Lincoln lies the only salvation for the imperilled 
union, and finally taking the field at the head of a 
regiment at Gettysburg. They debar politics from 
their conversation, but life forces politics upon them, 
and the deep affection that exists between them tri- 
umphs over the theories that would tear them apart. 
This is fundamentally a historical novel, but the 
history comes in only episodically, as its march 
affects the lives of those whose lot is cast in the 
little village. The love-story of the boy and girl 
runs like a golden thread through the narrative, but 
it is never sentimentalized, and neither the one nor 
the other allows it to become the whole of life. 
Leila is away for years at school, and John for years 
fighting with Grant, on the Mississippi and in the 
Wilderness, but in time's due course their lives be- 
come united, as they were all the while destined to 
become. Dr. Mitchell has aimed to give us an 
" impression of the multitudinous contacts which 
affect human lives," and this he has done, minutely 
and with unfailing sympathy and insight. It is good 
for us to know these people, and it was good for them 
to have lived in the critical time in which their lot 
was cast. We have here a cross-section of typical 
American life during the decade 1855-65, and prob- 
ably no other writer than Dr. Mitchell could have 
exhibited it to us in such just proportion and in so 
humane and philosophical a spirit. 

It has long been an open secret that the anony- 
mous novel "The Inner Shrine" and its two suc- 
cessors were the work of Mr. Basil King, and the 
authorship is now admitted on the title-page of 
his new novel, "The Way Home." We find this 
work less interesting than its predecessors, although 
it is fairly their match in character delineation and 
subtle analysis of motive. It fails, perhaps, more 
from an obtrusive didacticism than from anything 
else, for the author is too evidently sitting in judg- 
ment upon his hero instead of leaving the reader's 
decision to shape itself as the character is unfolded. 
Charlie Grace is the son of a clergyman, and is 
himself intended for his father's profession. But 
his growing manhood revolts against the hypocrisies 
that hedge that profession round, and his pleasure- 
loving instincts demand for their satisfaction a more 
worldly form of success. He goes into business 
and becomes materially successful, but in so doing 
hardens his heart toward his fellows, and does not 
hesitate to seize the opportunities within his grasp, 
building his achievement upon the failure of his 
rivals. At the climax of his selfish endeavor, he 
overreaches himself, and his plans are thwarted by 
the man whom he has supplanted. Married to a 
woman morally far too good for him, he becomes 
faithless to her in thought, although not in act, and 
is brought back to her in the end by the need of her

support when he is pulled up short in his career by 
a physician's indeterminate death-sentence. It is 
thus that he finds "the way home," but we doubt if 
he would have found it otherwise. There is much 
beautiful and impressive writing in these pages, but 
it smacks a little too much of the pulpit, and the 
process by which the hero's soul is supposed to be 
saved (by a narrow squeak) too closely resembles 
"conversion" to be taken for an unimpeachable 
ethical regeneration. 

The American interest in "doing things" is 
chiefly responsible for the popularity of such books 
as Mr. Rex Beach's "The Iron Trail." The hero 
of this novel, an Alaskan promoter and railway 
contractor named Murray O'Neil, is the kind of 
man who accomplishes his purpose, no matter what 
the obstacles, and the fact that physical violence 
and general lawlessness are resorted to as a matter 
of course whenever they are found necessary only 
endears him the more to the readers who follow his 
fortunes with breathless interest. The big thing 
that O'Neil does is to wrest an Alaskan pass from 
the clutches of a rival claimant, and to carry a 
railway through it in the face of formidable diffi- 
culties. The difficulties are not those offered by 
nature alone, for in addition he has to contend with 
underhanded opposition, treachery, legal chicanery, 
and the failure of funds at the critical moment. It 
makes a big vivid story, crammed with action and 
sweetened with sentiment. Mr. Beach knows his 
Alaska well, and can describe its terrifying aspects 
very effectively. Otherwise, his book has not much 
style to speak of, and does not seem to need it by 
reason of its surplusage of dramatic interest. There 
are two girls mixed up with the action, and O'Neil, 
after dallying with one of them half-way through 
the book, shifts to the other and carries her off. In 
the course of the narrative, he has occasion to make 
much caustic comment upon the policy of the Inte- 
rior Department in opposing the exploitation of 
Alaskan resources for private gain, and is evidently 
on the side of the men who go into the wilderness 
to win for themselves individual fortunes. Of course 
his vision is blinded by local prejudice, but he comes 
near to carrying our sympathies with him. 

"Otherwise Phyllis" is a new "Hoosier Chron- 
icle," even richer and racier than the earlier one, 
which marked Mr. Nicholson's transition from the 
ranks of the irresponsible entertainers to the small 
company of novelists who go about the exercise of 
their art seriously and hold it in respect. When we 
have completed the story of Phyllis, we have not 
only made the charming acquaintance of a real girl, 
but we have also learned more about life in Mont- 
gomery, Indiana, than several years of actual resi- 
dence would have been likely to impart to us. We 
know the leading citizens of the town in their private 
characters and in their social and business relation- 
ships ; we know the home?, the farms, the banks, the 
business offices; and we know the shady history of 
the Sycamore Traction Company. The outstanding 
characters in this novel are Montgomerys and 



Holtons. Many years before the story opens, Lois 
Montgomery had married Tom Kirkwood, a pro- 
fessor in the local college and afterwards a lawyer 
somewhat neglectful of his profession. Then Lois 
had scandalized the community by running away 
with the black sheep of the Holtons, leaving her 
husband with a baby daughter, ' Otherwise Phyllis." 
Later, a divorce had set Kirkwood free, and marriage 
with Holton had regularized the social status of Lois, 
living on the Pacific coast. When we have got fairly 
well acquainted with the grown-up Phyllis, which 
means taking her to our hearts, and when we have 
come to know intimately her lovable father, her three 
fussy and snobbish aunts, and her substantial and 
crusty uncle, to say nothing of various Holtons, good 
and bad, we are prepared for the appearance of Lois 
upon the scene, and the complications that follow. 
Here is where the author scores heavily, for Lois does 
not return as the repentant sinner, begging to be 
forgiven, but as a level-headed woman of the world, 
who has long since sent the partner of her flight 
about his business, and who has made a large for- 
tune in Western investments. She knows that her 
youthful escapade was foolish, but she has long since 
paid the penalty for that, and thinks the world should 
call it square. There is nothing morbid or brooding 
about her; she enjoys life and gets a good deal out 
of it; and she returns to Montgomery to see what 
sort of a girl her daughter has grown to be. She has 
reason to be entirely satisfied with Phyllis, and the 
affection which she offers is returned in full measure. 
From the standpoint of Phyllis, this newly-found 
mother is brilliant, companionable, and sympathetic, 
and why should she reject the love so freely offered 
because of those old, unhappy, far-off things that are 
to the girl nothing more than a misty family tradi- 
tion. The way in which Mr. Nicholson steers clear 
of sloppy sentiment in all this business deserves 
our profound gratitude. The quality of matter-of- 
factness attaches to this story throughout, and this 
is what makes its art so genuine. The humor of the 
book is particularly deft; it is never made obtrusive, 
but it suffuses the entire narrative with a genial 
glow, and constitutes one of the chief elements of its 
charm. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The spiritual What a man thinks and feels and 

development of a believes is always so much more 
great Unitarian, important than what he does, that in 
the case of any interesting personality we would, 
if we could, gladly exchange the outer facts for the

own inner life is so difficult that not often are we 
granted the privilege of such self-revelations. In 
"Charles Gordon Ames: A Spiritual Autobi- 
ography" (Houghton), we have a book of intense 
interest, especially for those who knew the magnetic 
personality of the man during his life. But even 
those who never met him, to whom even his name

may be unknown, can hardly fail to follow with 
keen satisfaction the charmingly written story of 
the development of a soul. Certainly, no one can 
read unmoved the first chapter, "The Religion of a 
Boy," revealing what a child can suffer from being 
misunderstood. Like many another youngster, he 
was regarded as heedless, perverse, unfaithful; his 
quickness to learn was merely a misfortune because 
it left him all the more time for mischief. Yet he 
was never long without serious thoughts ; there was 
never a day when he could not have been reached 
by love and sweet reasonableness. The chapter 
entitled "How I Became a Preacher" is scarcely 
less touching. Before he was quite eighteen years 
old, his fellow church-members gave him a hearing 
in order to determine whether his "call to preach" 
was a true one. He was the janitor of the church, 
and lighted the vestry for the occasion. They 
listened to his sermon, held a meeting afterward, 
and voted to approve Brother Ames in publicly 
" improving his gift." His little vessel was launched 
and he felt himself in the ministry. Then followed 
experiences baffling enough to discourage any but 
the stoutest heart. Minnesota in the fifties was in 
its frontier stage; hither he went, established a 
church, and on a salary of two hundred dollars a 
year managed somehow to support his family, not- 
withstanding an expostulation from one member of 
his congregation on his extravagance in money 
matters ! The important event of this period was a 
gradual change of his own religious views so great 
that conscience forced him to withdraw not only 
from the Free Baptist Church of Minneapolis, which 
he had organized five years before, but from the 
denomination altogether. The story of the next 
half-century is told in the concluding chapter, called 
"Fifty Years among the Unitarians." The Epi- 
logue, written by Dr. Ames's daughter, Alice Ames 
Winter, contributes many interesting reminiscences 
and some fine tributes from personal friends. One 
of these tributes characterizes him as " the last figure 
of the great Unitarian group. There was no other 
quite so Emersonian. A hundred of his sermons 
were almost Emerson essays. He had Emerson's 
firm and quiet faith, his penetration and poetry of 
nature, his wit and humor and sententiousness, his 
gift for homely illustration, his buoyant optimism, 
and his democracy." 

Reconciling " Tn e Meaning of Evolution " (Mac- 
reltgionand inillan), by Mr. Samuel Christian 
Darwinism. Schmucker, is a latter-day attempt 
at reconciling religion and Darwinism. According 
to one's point of view such a task will be regarded 
as either a work of supererogation or an impossi- 
bility. Looked at either way, this particular book 
does not impress one as an especially strong or 
deep contribution. Its style has a bit too much of 
Pecksniffian unctuosity to be relished. Even our 
theological faculties of the present day demand 
sterner and more filling intellectual pabulum than 
is furnished by Mr. Schmucker. A very dilute 



account of the principal factors and the course of 
organic evolution forms the concrete subject matter. 
From the biological side, the reviewer has not been 
able to discover in the book one single new idea, or 
even a novel development of a well-known one. 
The whole theory of the method of organic evolu- 
tion is just now passing through a most interesting 
stage of development. Old ideas are being criti- 
cized, and new ones are being tested, with such 
rapidity as to make it a matter of some diffi- 
culty even for the specialist in this field to form a 
just estimate of the immediate status of expert 
opinion about the method of evolution. This con- 
dition of affairs would seem to afford both an 
opportunity and a stimulus to the popular writer. 
Liveliness and life seem somehow to be related. 
How far ahead of Mr. Schmucker are topics of 
current interest in evolution is indicated by the 
fact that the names of Mendel, Bergson, Driesch, 
Galton, and Karl Pearson are not even mentioned 
in his pages. The sole concession to modernism is 
a scant two pages (and a portrait) devoted to De 
Vries and his mutation theory. This discussion 
closes with the following truly precious thought: 
" Just at present it seems premature to believe that 
all evolution is by mutation, although quite possibly 
some of it is." The personal field-observations of 
the author, especially some of those on birds, form 
the one redeeming feature of the book. It has been 
said that a nearly infallible test of a writer's com- 
petency to discuss evolution is afforded by the way 
in which he spells the name of the most distin- 
guished Neo-Darwinian. By this test the present 
author fails, since throughout the text " Weissman " 
is written, while curiously enough the legend of the 
plate facing p. 238 (presumably furnished by the 
publisher) correctly states that the gentlemen por- 
trayed is "August Weismann." Et de hoc satis. 

Or ek art as ^ n ^ ne diffusion of an intelligent love 
the expression of art, the Bureau of University 
of Greek life. Travel in Boston has played an im- 
portant part with its prints and publications ; and 
its president, Dr. H. H. Powers, has been its leading 
apostle. As personal conductor, as lecturer, as author, 
he has spread the gospel of the beautiful in all parts 
of the land ; and his utterances, on Italian art espe- 
cially, are of wide acceptance. To these he has now 
added a volume on " The Message of Greek Art " 
(Macmillan), which will well repay careful study. 
From Winckelmann down, we have had many a 
history of Greek Art ; but they have all stuck pretty 
close to their text as conceived in the word "Art." 
Dr. Powers apprehends that the emphasis would 
better be laid on "Greek." To him, "the subject 
is never dissociated in thought from its great back- 
ground of Greek civilization, and it derives its chief 
interest to the writer from the fact that it so con- 
stantly reveals and interprets this larger fact. It is 
therefore the message of Greek art, what it has to 
tell us of the Greeks, of their personality, their ideals, 
and their experiences, that will chiefly concern us 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



363 



rather than considerations of process or later acci- 
dent." To this conception of his task the author 
generally holds true ; the result being that we have 
a history of Greece and one of Greek art running 
in parallel channels, and each explaining the other. 
A difficult undertaking ; and achieved, it must be 
admitted, with a high degree of success. Dr. Powers 
has never lost sight of the Greek national character 
as interpreted in art forms. Thus the curves of 
rosette, scroll, and cuttle-fish tentacles, so universal 
in Mycenaean decoration, are indicative of a gentle 
and effeminate civilization, just as "the harsh zig- 
zags and bristling angles which marked the pottery 
of that civilization's successors and conquerors 
reflected in its turn a more rugged and martial 
nature." So again, in the elaborate coiffures, frills, 
and edgings which ornament the draped female 
figures of the Acropolis, Dr. Powers sees the influ- 
ence of the benevolent but cramping tyranny of 
Pisistratus, under which true liberty was shackled 
and personality repressed. When he comes to the 
Great Age, it is Phidias who looms before him as 
a great statesman, whose life-work was to assist 
Pericles in making Athens imperially great, rather 
than that of a "mere" sculptor absorbed in his art. 
These are not all new views; but we have never 
seen them urged so eagerly and eloquently. Dr. 
Powers writes with an enthusiasm which is more of 
a challenge than an appeal ; his style is high-colored, 
and rich in epigram and colloquialisms. Occasion- 
ally he forgets his perspective, as in his extended 
discussion of the nade in art, and his invective 
against some of the yardstick critics and Philistines 
who are found even in studios and lecture-rooms. 
The book is fascinating throughout; but, like other 
fascinating books of criticism, must be read with 
some reserves. The 137 illustrations are beautiful 
and well-chosen ; some of them reproducing statues 
which we have not seen in other works of the kind, 
e. ff., the Vatican Eros and the Boston Zeus. In 
speaking of the marble copies of Polyclitus's Hera, 
the fine head found by the American School at 
Argos, and now in Athens, is rather oddly omitted. 
A few misprints should be noted: "Lybia" (p 41), 
"Colonnus" (p. 128), "properous" (p. 129), "cor- 
alled" (p. 210). 

A high-spirited daughter of the Con- 
federacy has left a vivacious record 
of harrowing war-time experiences in 
a volume now published by her son after her death, 
and entitled by him "A Confederate Girl's Diary" 
(Houghton). Sarah Morgan, afterward Mrs. Sarah 
Morgan Dawson, as her name appears on the title- 
page, was the daughter of Judge Thomas Gibbes 
Morgan of Baton Rouge ; and it was at or near Baton 
Rouge and New Orleans that she lived through such 
times as may well have tried men's souls, to say noth- 
ing of women's. Her diary, begun in the spring of 
1862 as a distraction from the glooms and horrors 
of the period, extends to the summer of 1865, and is 
necessarily devoted mostly to the minor and nearer 



happenings in the writer's little world. But as death 
and disaster visited her home and neighborhood in 
the progress of the war, she developed a cordial 
hatred of the Yankees and expressed herself vigor- 
ously in denunciation of their atrocities. "And this 
is WAR!" she writes on an early page. "Heaven 
save me from like scenes and experiences again." 
There was worse to come, however. Her description 
of the wrecked and pillaged homestead at Baton 
Rouge is moving indeed. In her satirical thrusts at 
"good, kind General Butler" we see her laughing 
through her tears. Her account, as an eye-witness, 
of the burning of the Confederate vessel " Arkansas " 
by her crew after her machinery had broken down, 
in order to prevent her capture by the " Essex," would 
seem to throw new light on what has hitherto been 
accepted as a Federal victory. As the production 
of a young girl of little formal education, the diary 
is surprisingly vivid and vigorous in its style. Writ- 
ten often in the hurry and panic of perilous times, it 
maintains a certain unstudied finish of manner that 
is remarkable. Mr. Warrington Dawson, the diar- 
ist's son, who transcribed the faded pages for publi- 
cation, gives assurance that he has altered nothing, 
only omitted a few passages of purely personal or 
family interest. He has furnished the book with a 
biographical introduction, and there are portraits 
and other illustrative material. 

studies in The posthumous volume of studies 

English bv an IT^IT^I.T. 

American Dv *rank Egbert Bryant, Associate 

scholar. Professor of English in the Univer- 

sity of Kansas, entitled "The History of English 
Balladry, and Other Studies" (Badger), brings 
together a notable group of essays on subjects con- 
nected with the English language and literature. 
The title-essay is the outgrowth of a doctoral thesis 
at Harvard, and presents a valuable account of the 
emergence of the English ballad in early times, and 
of its development through the reign of Elizabeth. 
Wise and deep scholarship are reflected here in a 
study which, although uncompleted, will be of con- 
stant service to students in this field. It is unfor- 
tunate that the proofreading has not been done by 
someone familiar with Middle English, for there 
are instances in which thorn and the letter p have 
been sadly confused. The second essay, on Less- 
ing's "LaocoOn," was printed in 1906, at the Uni- 
versity of Michigan, and has already received praise 
from eminent authorities in America and in Europe. 
A clear and penetrating analysis is made of Less- 
ing's dicta regarding Description, and his inconsis- 
tencies are laid bare; then the essay goes on, 
progressively, building up a theory of Description 
which contains matter very suggestive to students 
of this subject. As an instance of acute application 
of the newer views of psychological aesthetics, this 
study deserves close attention, especially from young 
teachers. The brief papers that form the latter part 
of the volume are connected with subjects linguistic 
and phonetic, appealing chiefly to the specialist, 
although the study of " Conservation in Language "

will engage the interest of any thoughtful reader. 
The loss that American scholarship has suffered in 
Professor Bryant's death at the outset of his career 
is a loss that can be ill-sustained. We need, very 
greatly, just such scholars, quiet, profound, and 
tireless in their scrutiny of facts and of theories. 
Sound knowledge, combined with power of resist- 
ance to conventional dogma and a tenacious skill 
in penetrating to the centre of matters, character- 
ized the work of Dr. Bryant. With years of study 
under leaders at Michigan, at Yale, and at Harvard, 
with experience in libraries abroad, and with the 
prestige of work already noted in high places, he 
was equipped to enter upon a life of unusually vital 
scholarship. This volume is a significant contribu- 
tion to our library of critical investigation in the 
field of English. 

New gleanings The volume entitled "A Pilgrimage 
from the prose of Pleasure : Essays and Studies " 
of Swinburne. (Badger) by Algernon Charles Swin- 
burne is made up of gleanings from the scattered 
prose writings of the poet. Some of the eight num- 
bers included the "Dead Love" of 1862, the 
essay on Dickens published in the "Quarterly Re- 
view," 1902, and " An Unknown Poet [Wells] " pub- 
lished in the "Fortnightly Review," 1875 are not 
so difficult of access as to make the present reprint 
a particular boon, but for the others we may well be 
grateful, as for the full bibliography that has been 
prepared by Mr. Edward J. O'Brien. " A Pilgrimage 
of Pleasure" is taken from "The Children of the 
Chapel," a tale by Mrs. Disney Leith, published in 
1864. It is a morality, accepted as Swinburne's by 
most of the bibliographical specialists, and in our 
opinion bearing the sign manual of the poet upon 
almost every line. It exhibits Swinburne's uncanny 
imitative powers as unmistakably as any of the pieces 
in the first " Poems and Ballads " or as the border 
ballads of a later date. The critical essay on Bau- 
delaire and the note on Meredith's "Modern Love" 
may both be found in the files of the "Spectator" 
for 1862, but we are glad that we no longer have 
to resort to that source to read them. The Baude- 
laire essay, indeed, belongs with Swinburne's most 
finished critical studies. The notes on Simeon 
Solomon are dated 1871, come from a forgotten 
ephemeral periodical, "The Dark Blue," and call 
our attention to a forgotten artist, whom even a 
Swinburnian eulogy has not been sufficient to save 
from oblivion. Much the same may be said of John 
Nichol's " Hannibal," which the poet eulogized in 
the " Fortnightly Review " for 1872. The chief 
interest for us of Mr. O'Brien's bibliography is the 
revelation which it affords of the great number of 
fugitive items, existing only in private editions of 
twenty copies or less, which the general reader has 
no chance of seeing. Surely something must be 
done to make these things accessible. We note that 
the bibliographer gives recognition to THE DIAL for 
being the first to publish two of Swinburne's poems 
(vol. XLVII., pp. 504-5). 



Walks and ^ work offered as " a handbook for 

talks in young people" which many grown ups 

music land. w ju also welcome is "In Music Land" 
(Browne & Howell Co.), by the veteran musical 
critic, Mr. George P. Upton. Its purpose is to 
introduce the reader to an acquaintance with the 
life-stories of the great composers, with the origin 
and structure of the most popular forms of musical 
composition, and with the chief musical instruments 
used by the orchestra and the special qualities of 
each as mediums of conveying musical thoughts and 
feelings. Precisely such a work as this, so entirely 
free from technicalities, has not been undertaken 
before; and Mr. Upton is precisely the man best 
fitted to have written it. For not only does he 
understand and love music, but he understands 
and loves children; and we venture to guess that 
" Dorothy " and the others to whom the stories are 
told regard him as quite one of themselves. In the 
twelve biographies beginning with Bach and ending 
with Verdi, perhaps the most notable fact brought 
out by the writer is the almost invariable sadness 
and harshness of these musicians' childhoods. Men- 
delssohn seems almost the only exception. Com- 
menting on this, Mr. Upton philosophizes thus: 
"Perhaps that is one reason why his music is 
always graceful, refined, and beautiful, though it 
is not as great as that of the composers who have 
suffered. . . . When Elf-Land seems far away, and 
the leaves are falling, and the sky grows gray, you 
will turn to the greater masters." Discussing the 
Orchestra and its instruments, the author is partic- 
ularly happy in his characterizations. For example, 
the harp is called " the hermit thrush of the family 
because it is a lovely singer . . . the only one that 
has got into Heaven . . . the favorite of the 
angels." The "Postlude" is eloquent, and surely 
should do much to banish from the youthful mind the 
tendency to regard the study of music as drudgery, 
or, at best, a mere frill to more serious pursuits. 
"It is the one art which above all others enhances 
the joy of the world, the one which above all others 
inspires to action, the one above all others which 
rests you when weary, which consoles you when sor- 
rowful. . . . No other labor brings such rich spiritual 
compensation or abundant pleasure." Many quaint 
illustrations by Mr. James Bloomfield help to make 
this volume a particularly choice gift for all, young 
or old, who seek elementary musical knowledge. 

An Admiral's A native " faculty for making things

occurrences in the boyhood and youth of Admiral 
Dewey, and it came near to causing his premature 
and inglorious departure from Annapolis at the end 
of his first year in the Naval Academy. But it was 
his destiny to make a more graceful exit three 
years later, and very soon afterward to show him- 
self as capable a disciplinarian and commanding 
officer as he had been daring and resourceful in 
defying authority. His "Autobiography" (Scrib-

ner), written at last in his seventy-sixth year with 
the natural reluctance of a man of distinguished 
achievement to talk about his deeds, and only pro- 
duced at the repeated solicitation of friends, as his 
preface duly sets forth, gives with conciseness, and 
yet in a style that proves highly readable, the main 
facts of his ancestry, education, naval experience 
under Farragut at New Orleans and his later ser- 
vice in the Civil War, in the course of which he 
was the executive officer of nine successive ships, 
his part in the building of our modern navy, his 
appointment to the command of the Asiatic squad- 
ron, the battle of Manila Bay and the complex 
responsibilities imposed upon the victor immediately 
thereafter, and the chief events of his later peaceful 
years. In his account of the naval operations 
directed by Farragut, of the subsequent assault on 
Fort Fisher under Admiral Porter's leadership, and 
of the operations that ended in the complete destruc- 
tion of the Spanish squadron at Manila, there is no 
lack of movement and thrill. Appended documents 
treat of details in the important occurrences in the 
Philippines during those critical months of 1898. 
Pictures of war vessels and portraits of their officers 
abound. A confusing error in dates occurs (p. 205) 
in the account of movements immediately preceding 
the battle of Manila Bay. Otherwise, with few 
exceptions, the book shows evidence of adequate 
care in its preparation, for which indebtedness is 
acknowledged to Mr. Frederick Palmer. 



One who sided 
with the 
under dog. 



The late Edward A. Moseley, Sec- 
retary of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission from its organization in 
1887 until his death in 1911, was a whole-hearted 
champion of the defenceless employee whose occupa- 
tion exposed him to peculiar risks resulting in loss 
of life or limb. His part in securing the passage 
of the first safety-appliance act and the employers' 
liability act, with other services to his fellow-men, is 
well and fully told by Mr. James Morgan, a close 
friend of his for many years, in a substantial volume 
entitled "The Life Work of Edward A. Moseley in 
the Service of Humanity" (Macmillan). Though 
the son of a wealthy father and belonging by birth 
to the aristocracy of Newburyport, Moseley was a 
democrat at heart, a strenuous toiler by choice, and 
always the true friend of the people, with whom he 
mingled unaffectedly all his life. A year's experience 
as a common sailor under the harshest of captains 
and with the roughest of shipmates had early proved 
of what stuff he was made. Characteristic of the 
man was his organizing of a strike among the work- 
men of his own firm, in order to have a pretext for 
raising their wages. The book abounds in similar 
instances of disinterested endeavor, usually success- 
ful, to improve the condition of the laboring classes. 
Extracts from his correspondence and from other 
documents of interest are inserted here and there. 
A link connecting Mr. Moseley with the literary 
world is found in his relationship to Mrs. Harriet 
Prescott Spofford, whose sister he married, and with 



whom he and his family maintained terms of inti- 
macy. Portraits, views, appended matter, and index 
round out the book's equipment as a well-executed 

piece of work.

Short sketches . . 

of Welsh life to sprinkle her page with Doric dia- 
and character. ! O g Ue i n such wise as to impart an 
air of verisimilitude to what might otherwise be a 
bald and unconvincing narrative. Her "Picture 
Tales from Welsh Hills" (Browne & Howell Co.) 
consists of nine stories and sketches abounding in 
rapid portraiture of Welsh character and customs, 
Welsh oddities and superstitions, Welsh habits of 
thought and speech. In the opening story, "The 
Madness of Winifred Owen," the heroine rids her- 
self of the attentions of an unwelcome lover by 
taking a subtle poison that renders her temporarily 
insane, and afterward marries the man of her choice. 
The longest tale in the book, "The Way He Went," 
gives the history of a phenomenally intellectual 
country lad who achieves an Oxford education, 
grieves his mother by taking to wife a girl not of 
his own country, and dies an early death. A sketch 
entitled "Comic Objects of the Country" presents 
in amusing form the impressions of a London gamin 
on being sent to an industrial school in rural Wales. 
Of such trifles. is the book compounded, but the 
story-teller's art makes them worth while. Even 
the minor characters are made to stand out in dis- 
tinct shape by a skilful stroke or two of the pen, as 
the schoolmaster Macpherson, "whose career had 
been checked by a moral scrape of his youth," and 
whose ambition, "under the slur of it, had finally 
settled down to the lifelong position of an assistant 
master, manufacturing brilliant products rather than 
shining as one himself." Some aberrations in the 
writer's English, perhaps attributable to the con- 
tagious influence of the Welsh idiom, will be noted 
here and there by a critical reader, who will grieve 
at Miss Thomas's unabashed use of "enthuse," 
without apologetic quotation marks, and at her dis- 
regard of a good old rule of grammar in speaking 
of "the unkindest cut of the two."

NOTES. 



Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton is preparing a volume on 
Charles Kingsley for the " English Men of Letters " 
series. 

M. Jean Finot, author of " Problems of the Sexes," 
has recently completed a volume which Messrs. Putnam 
will soon publish in an English translation entitled 
"The Science of Happiness." 

The extended biography of Francis Thompson, upon 
which his friend Mr. Everard Meynell has been at work 
for two or three years past, will shortly be issued in 
this country by Messrs. Scribner. 

Mr. Howard Elliott, recently appointed president of 
the New York, New Haven, and Hartford lines, has 
written a book entitled " The Truth about the Rail- 
roads," which Houghton Mifflin Co. will publish at 
once. 

A life of Dr. Munger of the United Church of New 
Haven, by his friend and fellow-minister, Dr. Benjamin 
Wisner Bacon, is announced by the Yale University 
Press. The book is to bear the title, "Life of Dr. 
Theodore Thornton Munger, New England Minister." 

The works of Samuel Butler, the gifted author of 
" Erewhon " to whom we devoted an article in our last 
issue, are gradually being issued in American editions. 
Messrs. Button now announce his travel book, " Alps 
and Sanctuaries," in a new edition edited by Mr. R. A. 
Streatfeild. 

" The Constitution of Matter," to be published this 
month by Houghton Mifflin Co., is made up of six lec- 
tures delivered by Professor Joseph Sweetland Ames 
of Johns Hopkins University. They set forth the 
latest discoveries and theories in regard to molecules, 
atoms, radiation, etc. 

Stephen Jenkins, whose death at the age of fifty-six 
was reported two weeks ago, had recently completed a 
volume on " The Old Boston Post Road," which Messrs. 
Putnam will publish this month. Mr. Jenkins was also 
the author of "The Greatest Street in the World " and 
" The Story of the Bronx." 

Three books just announced by Mr. John Ho well, a 
San Francisco bookseller who is now to enter the pub- 
lishing field, are the following: " Brunelleschi," by Mr. 
John Galen Howard; "The Fall of Ug: A Masque of 
Fear," by Mr. Rufus Steele; and " The Runner's Bible," 
compiled and annotated by Mr. N. S. Holm. 

The well-known " Photogravure Series " published 
by the John C. Winston Co. will soon receive the 
addition of a volume on " French Canada and the St. 
Lawrence: Historical, Picturesque, and Descriptive," by 
Mr. J. Castell Hopkins. Twelve photogravure plates, 
from original photographs, will illustrate the work. 

"English Dramatic Poetry," by Professor Felix 
Schelling, "English Elegiac, Didactic, and Religious 
Poetry," by Very Rev. H. C. Beeching, and " English 
History and Schools of History," by Professor Richard 
Lodge, are three shortly forthcoming volumes in 
Messrs. Dutton's "Channels of English Literature" 
series. 

Mr. Edwin A. Brown is a well-to-do citizen of Den- 
ver, who believes that the way to investigate social 
conditions is to put yourself in the other fellow's place. 
He also believes that the great problem before us to-day 
is the problem of taking care of the temporarily unem- 
ployed the wandering, homeless, penniless working- 
man. To find out what our big cities are doing to 



meet this problem, Mr. Brown set out on a tour of the 
country in the guise of a man without employment, but 
willing to work. His experiences will be published this 
month by Browne & Howell Co., under the title 
" Broke : The Man Without the Dime," and will be 
illustrated from photographs. 

Mrs. Sara Andrew Shafer, an occasional contributor 
to THE DIAL and the author of several published books, 
was killed in an automobile accident on October 18, 
near her home in La Porte, Ind. Her writings include 
" The Day before Yesterday," " Beyond Chance of 
Change," " A White Paper Garden," and volumes on 
Annapolis, Frederick, and Mackinac in the " Historic 
Towns " series. 

" The Life of Florence Nightingale " will be pub- 
lished very shortly by Messrs. Macmillan. It is from 
the pen of Sir E. T. Cook, who has had access to the 
family papers, and so has been enabled to give for the 
first time a full account of this remarkable woman. 
The biography will be found to possess a special sig- 
nificance as correcting and supplementing what its 
author describes as "a popular legend," though only 
in the direction of enhancing the greatness of a noble 
life. It will consist of two volumes and will be fur- 
nished with interesting portraits and other illustrations. 

A collection of " Folk-Ballads of Southern Europe," 
transcribed and translated from many Romance lan- 
guages and dialects by the late Sophie Jewett, will 
be published immediately by Messrs. Putnam. Miss 
Jewett's last work was done on these ballads, and they 
are said to reveal her art in its delicacy and in its 
strength. The original texts are printed on pages facing 
the translations. Notes giving the history of ballad- 
texts and indicating the analogues of the different bal- 
lads have been added by the editor, Professor Katharine 
Lee Bates, who has incorporated many extracts from 
the lecture notes of Miss Jewett's college course on the 
ballads and many of her rough translations not included 
in this collection. 

William Garrott Brown, an historical writer of not- 
able achievement and promise, died at New Canaan, 
Conn., October 19, at the age of forty-five. From 1893 
to 1901 he was assistant librarian at Harvard, and dur- 
ing the following year lectured there on American his- 
tory. Besides an " Official Guide to Harvard Univer- 
sity " and numerous contributions to " The Atlantic " 
and other periodicals, be is the author of "A History 
of Alabama,'' "Andrew Jackson," "Stephen Arnold 
Douglas," " The Lower South in American History," 
" Golf," " A Gentleman of the South," The Foe of 
Compromise and Other Essays," and a " Life of Oliver 
Ellsworth." Since 1908 he had been on the editorial 
staff of " Harper's Weekly." 

Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology have united in establishing a School for 
Health Officers, and the "Catalogue and Announce- 
ment," an interesting pamphlet of forty-one pages, will 
be sent to applicants by Mr. Roger Pierce, President's 
Office, Harvard University. The new school is not to be 
confused with the Harvard course leading to the degree 
of Doctor of Public Health (Dr. P. H.); the two are 
independent of each other, and the school will confer 
no degree, but will give a Certificate of Public Health 
(C.P.H.) "to candidates who have satisfactorily com- 
pleted the studies in their approved schedule, who have 
spent not less than one academic year in residence, and 
who have otherwise complied with all requirements."

The Princeton University Press, recently organized, 
announces the formation of a Committee on Publica- 
tions, composed of Dean William F. Magie, Professor 
Edward Capps, Professor Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., 
Professor Frank Albert Fetter, and Professor Varnum 
Lansing Collins. This Committee will consider all 
manuscripts and proposals for publication, and the 
right to authorize publications with the imprint of the 
Press rests solely with this Committee. Since organi- 
zation, the University Press has been developing its 
manufacturing business, which is now self-supporting 
and housed in a handsome and well-equipped building. 
With their organization perfected and with their own 
plant capable of manufacturing any publications they 
may issue, the University Press now looks forward to 
a steady development of its publishing business. Already 
a few books have been issued, and many more are pro- 
jected. Among the latter are " The Beginnings of 
Libraries," by Mr. Ernest C. Richardson, to be pub- 
lished this year. 

News of several promising autumn biographies, not 
yet announced on this side, reaches us from London. 
Among others we note the following: " Memories of 
Charles Dickens," by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald; "Life of 
Wagner," by Mr. John F. Runciman; " J. M. Synge 
and the Irish Literary Theatre," by M. Maurice Bour- 
geois; "George Borrow and His Circle," by Mr. Clem- 
ent K. Shorter; "Life of Meredith," by Mr. Thomas 
Seccombe; "Gold win Smith: His Life and Opinions," 
by Mr. Arnold Haultain; " Oscar Wilde and Myself," 
by Lord Alfred Douglas; "Coleridge and Wordsworth 
in the West Country: Their Friendship, Work, and 
Surroundings," by Professor Knight; "Contemporary 
Portraits," by Mr. Frank Harris; "Life of James 
Hinton," by Mrs. Havelock Ellis; " Twenty-Five Years: 
Reminiscences," by Mrs. Katharine T. Hiukson; 
" Memoir of Arthur John Butler," by Sir A. T. Quiller- 
Couch; " Shakespeare Personally," by the late Professor 
Masson; < Lord Lister: His Life and Work," by Dr. 
G. T. Wrench; and "Ouida: A Memoir," by Miss 
Elizabeth Lee. 

Reuben Gold Thwaites, whose work in the field of 
Western history has made his name familiar to every 
American historical student, died in Madison, Wis., on 
October 22. He was born in Dorchester, Mass., in 
1853, and in 1866 removed to Wisconsin. From 1876 
to 1886 he was managing editor of the " Wisconsin 
State Journal," published in Madison. In 1886 he was 
elected secretary of the State Historical Society of 
Wisconsin, and editor of the society's " collections," 
which positions he has occupied continuously since. He 
was President of the American Library Association in 
1900, and has held various other prominent offices of 
an active or honorary sort. His first published work, 
"Down Historic Waterways," appeared in 1888; this 
was followed at intervals of two or three years by 
" The Story of Wisconsin," " The Colonies, 1492-1750," 
"Our Cycling Tour in England," "On the Storied 
Ohio," volumes on Father Marquette and Daniel Boone 
in the " Pioneers of America " series, a " Brief History 
of Rocky Mountain Exploration," "France in America," 
a volume on Wisconsin for the " American Common- 
wealths " series, besides several other books of educa- 
tional or other more specialized character. Perhaps 
Dr. Thwaites's most valuable work was his editorial 
labors upon "The Jesuit Relations," published in 
seventy-three volumes during 1896-1901, which will 



always remain a noble monument of historical scholar- 
ship. He also edited the series of " Early Western 
Travels, 1748-1846," in thirty-six volumes, author- 
itative editions of the Lewis and Clark Journals, 
Father Hennepin's "New Discovery," Lahontan's "New 
Voyages to North America," Kinzie's "Wau Bun," 
and several other middle Western historical sources. 
Older readers of THE DIAL will recall with pleasure 
Dr. Thwaites's not infrequent contributions to these 
pages in the eighties and nineties. 

During the autumn the Oxford University Press 
will add the following titles to their various well-known 
series. In the " Oxford Poets," " The Poetical Works 
of William Blake," edited by Mr. John Sampson, and 
"A Century of Parody and Imitation," edited by Messrs. 
W. Jerrold and R. M. Leonard. In the " Oxford Edi- 
tions of Standard Authors," " Andersen's Fairy Tales," 
edited by Mr. W. A. Craigie; Goldsmith's "The Bee,"

1848-70; Macaulay's Essays; William Morris's Prose 
and Poetry, 1856-70; and Dante Gabriel Rossetti's

Library Books Come and 
Library Books Go, but 

Binding Goes on Forever! 

A good way to discover the best binding is to send 
a selection of books, varying widely in qualities of 
paper, to different binders, sending some to 

CHIVERS' BINDERY, Brooklyn, N.Y. 

Then watch their service and discover whose 
bindings allow of the most issues in good condition. 

CHIVERS' BINDINGS have, with more or less 
success, been imitated in several particulars, but by 
no means in all. 

You can have the REAL THING just as low in price 
as the partial imitation, with lasting economies in 
money and service.

Cosmo Hamilton in The New York Sun : 

"A new writer who is an old master. He 
has set himself in line with those great 
dead to whom the novel was a living 
throbbing thing." 

J. B. Kerfoot in Life: 

"The first treat of the new season." 

Augusta Gary in The Chicago Evening 
Post: 

"Altogether exceptional. It stands well 
outside and above the run of the sea- 
son's fiction." 

The Baltimore Evening News: 

"Qualified to walk unashamed with 
Bennett and Wells." 



The San Francisco Chronicle: "Worthy of the highest praise." 

The Independent: 

"Never did hero find himself the adored of three more enchanting heroines. A book 
which will deserve the popularity it is certain to achieve." 

The Detroit Free Press: "We have a new major American novelist." 

The Boston Transcript: 

"A novel to compel not only absorbed attention but long remembrance." 

Frederick Taber Cooper in The Bookman: 

"A compelling, fascinating piece of work which refuses to be laid aside." 

Samuel Abbott in The Boston Herald: 

"Mr. Dawson has dared splendidly to write, in a 'glorious abandon, a story all

EDITH WHARTON 

Has Achieved Another Great Triumph in Her New Novel 

THE CUSTOM of the COUNTRY 

Leading reviewers place it beside "The House of Mirth"; Declare it 
"Triumphant Fiction"; "A Graphic Picture of Modern 
Life"; "Undine Spragg a Memorable Figure." 



Chicago Record- Herald : 

" ' The Custom of the Country ' 
must take its place beside ' The 
House of Mirth ' as representing 
Mrs. Wharton's art at its best. The 
novel is written with a flashing 
vivacity of phrase, crisp dialogue 
and entire naturalness of character- 
ization. All the people are 'alive, 
but Undine Spragg is memorable ; 
it would not be surprising, indeed, 
if her name became a synonym for 
the modern American type of 
Becky Sharp." 



New York Herald: 

" Apart from its quality of inter- 
est, ' The Custom of the Country ' 
possesses a distinct value as a 
graphic picture of modern life both 
here and abroad, written by an ex- 
perienced pen from an entirely new 
point of view. It contains several 
excellent character sketches, the 
best of which, to my mind, are the 
fashionable portrait painter, Pop- 
ple, and the equally fashionable 
masseuse, Mrs. Heeny." 



Chicago Tribune : 

" It is a brilliant though a sinister 
performance. Mrs. Wharton's char- 
acterization is both powerful and 
adroit. She knows New York and 
depicts it as few others are able 
to do."

Described as "Daring in the True Sense"; as Presenting "The Truth"; 
as the Finest Presentation in any Novel of "Passion in All Its Moods." 

JOHN GALSWORTHY 

Acclaimed on all sides by reviewers for this account of 
"The Love Life of a Man." 



Boston Transcript: 

" That he does know many, 
many phases of man's inmost na- 
ture, his latest story clearly reveals. 
It discards all the old conventions, 
it upsets some of our most sacred 
moral traditions, it throws aside all 
commonplaces of fiction. But it is 
nevertheless the truth, and it is the 
truth that we want, especially in 
the novel." 



Chicago Evening Post: 

" John Galsworthy's new novel 
is daring in the true sense. 

" He has set out boldly to show 
us passion : not scenes of passion, 
but something that goes more 
directly against the grain of our 
decadent Victorianism and quite 
directly against that of our efflores- 
cent Reformism, the power of 
passion."

CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS 




By 



The Pall Mall Gazette : 

" It is not likely that the artistry 
of this novel will anywhere be over- 
praised. It has characteristics ex- 
tremely rare in fiction. I do not 
know another in which passion, in 
all its moods, is described with the 
charity of a finer sympathy or the 
poetry of a fuller insight. The 
book has great beauty."

HURRYING FATE AND GERALDINE By Florence Morse Klngsley 

The heroine's heart pulsates through the pages of the book. Her nature breathes forth an 
incense made of the distilled aroma of rose leaves. The hero, for there is a real one, is a man of 
the quality every woman must love, i 

The story is unique in many ways. The plot is really original and equally pleasing. It is 
not a mystery story, but it will be difficult to guess the conclusion. 

However interesting the plot may be and with however great ingenuity and charm the 
author unfolds her story through breathless or pastoral pages, no less wonderful is her delineation 
of character. Each of her chosen cast has been drawn with the delicate care and artistic touch 
which characterizes Mrs. Kingsley's work.

THE NEWEST BOOKS 



The Way Home 

By the Author of "The Inner Shrine" 
(Basil King) 

A book for the man or the woman who loves 
honesty is this new novel by the author of " The 
Inner Shrine. " For that is what the very human 
hero of this story is honest in his hatred of pre- 
tence, honest in his wilfulness, honest at last with 
himself when he finds that he has gone astray. 
He believed he had " gained the whole world " 
only to find that he had " lost his own soul." 
Illustrated. PostSvo. Cloth. $1.35 net. 



The Coryston Family 

By Mrs. Humphry Ward 

A love story, with a heroine who will rank as 
Mrs. Ward's most charming portrayal of young 
womanhood of to-day, and a dramatic representa- 
tion of the dramatic struggle between the radical 
and aristocratic elements of English society. As a 
rich sombre background against which the youth- 
ful love episodes stand out, is pictured the desper- 
ate efforts of a forceful woman to hold her power. 
Illustrated. PostSvo. Cloth. $1.35 net. 



The Passionate Friends By H. G. Wells 

The story of the turbulent lives of one man and one woman separated by the barrier of the law, 
yet attached by something stronger than any law stronger than themselves. A love story with a 
background of high idealism and prophecy of the future. 

"The heroine who 'wanted herself' and lost her freedom in providing that self with luxury 
is depicted with consummate art, while Stephen's wife is one of the most delightful of the Wells 
gallery of female portraits." London Literary Guide. 

Frontispiece. PostSvo. Cloth. $1.35 net. 



A Changed Man By Thomas Hardy 

Here is Hardy at his best, a book to arouse the keen interest of every Hardy lover. This new 
volume has all the wealth of his genius, for the tales in it were written when he was at the 
height of his career. They are more like condensed novels. "A Changed Man " takes the reader 
at once to Casterbridge and tells the romance of a captain of cavalry. All the stories are rich in 
atmosphere and character, and several are almost mediaeval in their power and mystery. 
Frontispiece and Map. Octavo. Cloth. $1.35 net. 



The Judgment House By Sir Gilbert Parker 

" The work displays a high degree of literary craftsmanship, and, in the more powerful situations, 
a restraint of which only the true artist knows the strength." Montreal Star. 

" The plot is more closely knit than was that of ' The Weavers,' while the characters are more 
deeply realized than in any of this author's novels." Chicago Record-Herald. 

" Never has Sir Gilbert written a novel more filled with keen and poignant sense of life than in 
this story, woven of London and the veld, of England and her policies, South Africa and her struggles 
during the Boer War. ... A thrilling, majestically moving story." New York Times.

A TRILOGY upon a Theme 
Vital to the HUMAN RACE 

THE TRUE THOUGHT OF MARRIAGE 
THE TRUE THOUGHT OF THE HOME 
THE TRUE THOUGHT OF THE CHILD 

By JOHN MILTON SCOTT 
Price, 1 5 cts. per copy, or the three for 36 cts. 

TN this day and age, in which there is so much discussion, 
dissension and shadow thrown upon so important a subject 
as that of marriage and the home, this is a timely and worthy 
group of booklets. In them the author beautifully portrays 
the purpose, the truth and the sanctity of true marriage, 
the home and the child. 

Of the first The Christian Work and Evangelist says: 

"We wish such a little book could be put into the hands 
of every couple about to found a home. It is one of the 
most thoughtful statements on the subject that has recently 
appeared and sets marriage in snch a true and fine light as a 
beautiful opportunity to render an inestimable service to 
humanity that it cannot help but impress every reader." 
The other two are only just from the press.

Colonel Roosevelt's Own Story of His Life 

Theodore Roosevelt: 



This exceptional story of a life replete with human interest, told in Colonel Roosevelt's 
characteristically vigorous and easily flowing colloquial style, is one that will make a strong and 
satisfying appeal to every class of readers. 

To the lover of the strenuous life as well as to the student of contemporaneous history, to the 
young people of the country particularly, who all find a special attraction in personal narrative of 
active achievement, this autobiography will afford keen satisfaction and high inspiration. 

From his boyhood days in Long Island, his adolescent youth at Harvard University, his young 
manhood days in the Wild West, and through a diversified public career which led to the Presidency 
of the United States, Colonel Roosevelt was a learner as well as a born leader. In this book he tells 
of the many things which he learned and how he learned them, relating them primarily with a view 
to the help they may give others. 

Taking the initiative in many of the most important events of our times both national and 
international his autobiography is a unique record of men and events, and of a career of almost 
unparalleled interest.

THE MONEY OF FOOLS. 

"For words are but wise men's counters, 
they do but reckon by them ; but they are the 
money of fools." Good old Thomas Hobbes 
was one of the wisest of men, and one of those 
least likely to find in a word anything more 
than its natural significance, and yet it may be 
questioned whether he were not himself betrayed 
or deluded into a strained interpretation of the 
very word which supplies a title for the great 
treatise upon political philosophy in which this 
famous dictum occurs. If he once crystallize 
into a metaphor some vast central concept, the 
keenest of thinkers will be unconsciously influ- 
enced by its accidental connotations, and find 
himself in danger of taking it too literally. The 
figurative habit of mind will play tricks with 
the best intelligence, and such terms as "levia- 
than" and "behemoth" lend themselves too 
easily to forced extensions of analogy beyond 
what is legitimate. The conception of society 
as an organism has its working uses, but it may, 
if not kept under strict subordination to fact, 
lead to the wildest vagaries of fancy. There is 
something marvellous in the power of words to 
direct thought, and if we do not go so far as 
Max Miiller in declaring that thought without 
words is impossible, we must at least admit our 
dependence on them for all but the most ele- 
mentary mental processes. To keep them our 
servants, instead of permitting them to become 
our masters, requires a degree of vigilance of 
which few intellects are completely capable. 
They are lurking in all the corners of the mind, 
seeking to instil prejudice into our reasoning, 
and persuading us into taking the short cuts 
that will spare us the difficult task of analysis. 

It was a wiser man than Hobbes who em- 
bodied in diabolical argument the quintessence 
of intellectual cynicism when he made Mephis- 
topheles thus advise the inquiring student: 

" Im ganzen haltet euch an Worte ! 
Dann geht ihr durch die sichre Pforte 
Zum Tempel der Gewissheit ein. 

Denn eben wo Begriffe fehlen, 

Da Stellt ein Wort zur rechten Zeit sich ein. 

Mit Worten lasst sich trefflich streiten, 

Mit Worten ein System bereiten, 

An Worte lasst sich trefflich glauben, 

Von einem Wort lasst sich kein Iota rauben." 

How the history of thought is strewn with ex- 
amples of this precept in practical application !

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 



Science, philosophy, ethics, politics, and theology 
afford countless illustrations of the use of words 
as current coin, in forgetf ulness of the fact that 
they are but the counters shaped by the intellect 
for its own uses. Such words as "vitalism," 
"determinism," "hedonism," and "protection- 
ism" are charged with infinite possibilities of 
mischievous employment, and have arrayed 
intellectual squadrons against one another in 
mortal combat. In the case of words in the 
armory of theology, the combat has been phy- 
sical, deluging the world with blood, as the wars 
of religion eloquently witness. Think of the 
malignant power of words as exemplified in the 
way in which the partisans of homoousion have 
cut the throats of the partisans of homoiousion, 
or in the armies that have taken the field in the 
defence of, and in opposition to, the doctrine of 
transubstantiation, or even in the conflicts that 
have been waged in behalf of some demonstrable 
mistranslation of a Scriptural passage. Such 
words have been something considerably more 
than counters in a game of wits. 

In the world of to-day, catch-words and epi- 
thets which are verbalized prejudices play an 
active part in muddling men's minds, and enlist- 
ing the unthinking in behalf of causes which 
they would abhor were their concealed implica- 
tions once made visible. The most wild-eyed 
and subversive measure has only to be labeled 
with the word " reform" or " progress " to win 
the suffrage of that large section of the multi- 
tude to whom the new thing is the desirable 
thing. Of course all sensible people believe in 
reform and progress, and proposals which really 
mean deformation and retrogression find ready 
acceptance in the minds of thousands whose 
vision is blinded, and whose faculty of analysis 
is paralyzed by a single persuasive and question- 
begging word. The term " Socialism " is made 
a blanket to cover all sorts of aims, worthy and 
unworthy, and those who use it as a watchword 
are skilful in coating the pill of its sinister 
significance with the sugar of a sentiment which 
cannot fail to appeal to all generous hearts. In 
this country, we cover the iniquities of the alli- 
ance between government and special privilege 
with the smooth word " protectionism," and the 
evil thing is almost impregnably intrenched 
behind that innocent and high-sounding word. 
In England, on the other hand, the same bad 
cause is already half-won by the naive device 
of calling it " fair trade " and "tariff reform." 
Many people ( who have votes) never get beyond 
that label. They say, "If a thing is 'fair' 
and a measure of ' reform,' of course we favor 



it," and they have no thought of probing its real 
meaning. "Temperance" is one of the most 
seductive of words, and yet what mean oppres- 
sions are committed in its name ! " The rights 
of man" is a mighty phrase with which to con- 
jure, yet under its aegis the French Revolution 
developed into a carnival of crime at which the 
world has not ceased to shudder. 

In an article on " Language, Action, and 
Belief," Mr. J. C. Thomas, in the October issue 
of " Bedrock," discusses the mischievous power 
of words in the field of science. Speaking of 
ideas and beliefs, he says : 

" These mental elements are materialized in language, 
the words of which form their discrete bodies. Within 
these verbal embodiments man has imprisoned, distorted, 
and tortured the ' ideal soul,' which in revenge has 
retaliated by making speech a fertile and a perennial 
source of falsity in every department of thought. But 
it is in connection with beliefs that language has in- 
flicted upon humanity the full blight of its curse. Beliefs 
are our springs of conduct our very guides in life 
hence our weal and woe are bound up indissolubly with 
our opinions and our creed. 

" It matters nothing that there exists no reality cor- 
responding to the idea which is the basis of belief; for 
that reality can be made to exist in the language which 
communicates it, by the simple device of coining terms 
and phrases which assume such existence. And these 
verbal embodiments have greater power of generating 
belief than even sense-impressions. A Roman youth 
found no difficulty in believing that Jupiter and Juno 
were real beings, for they were real beings in the 
language which conveyed to him the ideas." 

The writer then goes on to say that " we live in 
an age when language is strained to its utter- 
most to suggest and to engender belief in the 
untrue and the unreal." Taking for his special 
text the term " psychical research," he points out 
that its content is not psychical and its method 
is not that of research in any scientific sense. 

" Its nomenclature is a new coinage, bright from the 
mint, and specially struck off for the use of the Society 
[for Psychical Research] . It includes amongst others 
the terms: clairvoyance, clairaudieiice, astral-stage, 
psychic-force, telepathy, second-sight, levitation, auto- 
matic writing, rematerialization, double-sight, super- 
normal, thought-reading, and thought-transference 
every one of which is a question-begging epithet; that 
is, its function is simply and solely to insinuate beliefs 
in ideas and not to store or revive them." 

Call it by its proper name, "occult" or "magi- 
cal," and the charm would vanish, for then it 
would stand on its own merits, and its cause 
would not be prejudged by its vocabulary. 

At the present day, the work of education is 
being thoroughly demoralized by the obsession 
of the word "vocational" and its countless 
derivative phrases, such as "practical educa- 
tion " and " training for life." Call Greek and 
Latin "dead" languages, and their defence 



1913] 



THE DIAL

becomes hopeless against minds for whom the 
word is a coin and not a counter. Let the 
dead past bury its dead, and let us store the 
youthful mind with useful knowledge about 
farming and book-keeping and the art of 
advertising. The ultimate aims of education 
are clean forgotten, and only its immediate 
material aims are pursued. The old cultural 
ideal is a "fetish," and we know that a fetish 
is an object of ridicule to all sensible persons. 
We are calling all sorts of things fetishes now- 
adays, including the most precious and hard- 
won conquests of civilization. Mr. Jesse Macy 
has just declared : " We must cease to worship 
as a fetish a written Constitution whose framers 
knew it to be inadequate and defective," and 
Mr. Felix Adler said the other day of that 
document : " We have indulged in a kind of 
fetish worship of it, as if that remarkable in- 
strument had been directly revealed from on 
high." Now if ever the speech and gesture of 
fetish worship were justifiable, they would be 
so in the face of the ominous and scatter- 
brained attacks upon the Constitution that 
figure so largely in current political discussion. 
There are times when, as we remarked in our 
last issue, it is necessary to use exaggeration 
and over-emphasis in defence of a cause that 
is menaced by the sort of insidious and un- 
principled warfare now waged-* against the 
noblest work of political construction achieved 
in modern times. We may find morality itself 
characterized as a fetish before long in fact, 
that is what Nietzsche has practically done, to 
the admiration of ingenuous iconoclasm all over 
the world. And pending the universal accept- 
ance of that belief, we have endless novelists and 
dramatists who are seeing to it that no specific 
virtue escapes being held up to ridicule as an 
outworn fetish of religion or ethics in the totem- 
pole stage of its evolution. Let the vices take 
the place of the virtues as the objects of our 
worship ; they are likely to furnish a far more 
popular pantheon. Schopenhauer says some- 
where that if a child be taken early enough, 
and taught to say Mumbo- Jumbo with firmness 
and conviction a sufficient number of times, 
nothing that he learns later in life will shake 
his belief in that omnipotent spirit. Similarly, 
if we build up the association of "fetish" with 
any or all of these things on which St. Paul 
counselled us to think, we shall readily so 
great is the maleficent power of a word find 
better furniture for our minds, metal more 
attractive for the hommes sensuels moyens 
that most of us are. 



ON EDUCATION. 



Great nations at great epochs of their life think 
little of education. At such times the theory of 
doing things gives place to the art of doing things. 
Every man springs to his post, a wave of enthusi- 
asm and inspiration rolls over the land, great deeds 
are done, great arts and literatures are born, all, 
as it were, on the spur of the moment. For a state 
to be over-concerned, to make a special fuss, about 
education, is almost a confession that the generation 
which is on the stage at the moment is of little 
account, and that the only hope is to prepare a new 
one which may amount to something. 

America is paying a great deal of attention to 
education to-day, Are we willing to accept this 
depreciatory estimate of ourselves? If, instead of 
spending so large a part of our income in educating 
for the future, we were to put some of the money 
into rewarding great and notable deeds, encouraging 
art and literature, erecting beautiful buildings, and 
laying out healthful parks and towns, it would be 
better both for us in the present and for the genera- 
tions to come. It is less important to educate ten 
thousand Philistines than to develop one great poet, 
artist, or thinker for humanity. Probably the 
present agitation and activity in the educational 
field are largely due to woman's increasing influ- 
ence in affairs. Women rarely believe in their hus- 
bands, but they always think their children are 
going to set the world afire. 

However, we must take things as they are; and 
it is worth while to try to assess a little what is 
being done in education, to review the main ideas 
and tendencies of our time in that respect. We 
have been reading lately a book entitled "Culture, 
Discipline, and Democracy" by Dr. A. Duncan 
Yocum of the University of Pennsylvania. It is a 
really admirable work, but it is perhaps too calm in 
its closely reasoned argument to attract the attention 
it deserves. If Dr. Yocum had any single panacea to 
propose to mankind. if, like Rousseau, he rushed 
out into the streets crying "Back to Nature!" or like 
some modern propagandists, "Back to the land!"; or 
if, on the other hand, he preached the study of Sci- 
ence or any cultural discipline as a cure-all for our 
ills, he would be move likely, we believe, to have 
a large following. But he tries to hold a balance 
between all the elements that enter into life or the 
preparation for life. He gives a view of the present 
status in educational matters, and shows the lessen- 
ing confidence in formal discipline, the increasing 
demand for direct preparation for life. He thinks 
the latter the more certain of the two. He makes 
an analysis of formal or general discipline, and the 
conditions favorable to it. He admits the compara- 
tive uselessness of the old disciplinary subjects, the 
classics and mathematics, for the average scheme of 
life. As regards the classics, we think he is mainly 
right; because the rise of modern languages and lit- 
eratures and the re-discovery of Asiatic literatures

and philosophies have disturbed the old balance of 
power in knowledge. He harks back, then, to the 
interdependence of culture and direct preparation for 
life, and has some most wise remarks about the 
folly of attempting to develop artistic expression at 
the expense of aesthetic appreciation. In the end 
he decides that a dominating system of education 
must be ensured primarily through direct prepara- 
tion, and secondarily through specialization. The 
"old" education and the "new" must be complemen- 
tary. Either one of them has been enough for the 
wits of youth in the past, we don't know how they 
are going to stagger on under the burden of both. 

Masters of pedagogy are perhaps like doctors 
who think more of the colored drugs in their bottles 
than of the constitutions of their patients. Intel- 
lectually men are so different. They differ as the 
fibre and grain of the trees in the wood do. Some 
trees cut up into timber which will bear great strain ; 
some have a density and beauty of marking which 
fit them for polish and adornment; some are only 
good for firewood. Or they differ like the crystals 
of the rock in weight, color, lustre, and value. Men, 
trees, and crystals all bear witness to Nature's 
inexorable demand for an aristocracy. If we could 
only arrive at a system of education penetrating 
enough to detect these differences of quality in the 
youth of our race, flexible enough to fit each human 
being for his proper occupation, and opulent enough 
to give him a chance at it, then there would be 
little to complain about. We do not in the least 
mean that these differences in quality in mortals 
go by classes, that the rich and the poor differ 
as fine and coarse. On the contrary, the precious 
gifts of the intellect are scattered pretty evenly 
through the whole structure of society. It follows 
that a large percentage of those who go through 
our universities and institutions of learning are 
educated far beyond their wits; while innumerable 
potential scholars, inventors, artistic creators, among 
the poor, do not get the education which would be 
good for them. 

We confine real education to the intellectual 
qualities because, like physical health and strength, 
the moral qualities of man courage, endurance, 
sympathy, goodness are so instinctive, so widely 
diffused, that they can hardly be considered sub- 
jects of education at all. They are in widest com- 
monalty spread. Of course they may be the better 
for organization, may be intensified by religious 
training; but every man who has gone through the 
usual experiences of life, every woman who has 
borne children or earned her living, has put forth 
some of the highest qualities of our nature. We 
live in the thick of heroes and heroines. Though 
we only realize this when some crisis occurs, when 
some girl telegraphist sticks to her post in the face 
of a flood, or some Marconi operator goes down in 
his ship calling for help, yet the response to duty 
is so general and so ready that in this respect there 
is hardly a pin's-point of difference between ninety 
per cent of the members of the human race, edu- 



cated or uneducated. Of course different races and 
classes do vary in their ideas of morality and duty, 
but the primal instincts are everywhere the same. 

It is with the intellectual aptitudes, therefore, that 
culture and preparation must deal. And there are 
two methods: education and training. To educate 
is to educe, to draw out all the inherent capabilities 
of the student, to make him many-sided, refined, 
polished. To train is to inform him, exercise him, 
and make him efficient in one direction, usually that 
he may be able to earn his living by the practice of 
his profession, trade, or calling. The great mass 
of our youth, even if they had the ability, simply 
cannot give the time to cover both kinds of culture. 
They must choose one or the other. Even with stu- 
dents in the higher professions, the two courses can 
seldom be run together. Lawyers are acute but nar- 
row. Clergymen lack many-sidedness and knowl- 
edge of life. Doctors are apt to be materialists. 

For a hundred years in America, education, an- 
swering the democratic demand, has tried to give 
everyone a sip at all the fountains of knowledge. 
It has tried to give all the people an even chance. 
Of course with the time at the disposal of the great 
majority of students, anything like thoroughness has 
been impossible. And we have found out that this 
slight taste of many kinds of knowledge is about the 
worst possible preparation for the struggle of life. 
We have found out that it does not pay to try to 
educate fifty million prospective Presidents of the 
United States. The demand for vocational train- 
ing, therefore, has sprung up and is becoming daily 
more and morte irresistible. 

Vocational training is a step towards the institu- 
tion of caste. It cannot hope to produce whole men, 
men open to every influence of nature and life 
and art, capable of the profoundest appreciation of 
the work of the past, of the greatest joy in the ex- 
istence of the present, of the best planning for the 
future. The vocationalized or specialized man is 
bound to be more or less of a machine, driving at 
his own ends and oblivious of a great part of that 
which makes life worth living. But perhaps caste 
is a shade better than chaos. 

Once in the world a community of free men was 
really educated. The Athenian youth entered the 
gymnasium at an early age. He recited the works 
of Homer and Hesiod and the lyric poets. He 
learned music and the use of the lyre. He lived in 
the shadow of marble palaces and temples, and the 
statues of gods and goddesses looked down upon him 
to lure him on to rival their beauty. He took part 
in processionals and festivals. His body was trained 
in all athletic exercises, and he saw or contended in 
the great games of Greece. Growing older, he walked 
and talked with the philosophers and teachers of 
wisdom, under their porches or in the open air. He 
haunted the law courts, and heard the orators dis- 
cuss public questions and affairs of state. He gath- 
ered with the whole mass of his fellow-citizens in the 
great open-air theatre, and saw imaged forth the 
mighty myths of his race, its historic triumphs, or

the personages of the day in a guise of wit and satire. 
Then, at the call of battle, he took his place in the 
ranks of the hoplites, or light-armed troops, and 
fought for his country. If, as was probable, he had 
estates in the archipelago or Asian mainland he 
made voyages thither and saw strange lands and 
peoples. But all this was possible only because the 
twenty thousand freeman of Athens held in leash a 
hundred thousand slaves to do their work for them 
and give them leisure to be forever running about 
telling some new thing. They could indulge in the 
wittiest gossip, the divinest speculations of philos- 
ophy, the production of perfect works of art and 
literature, because they were not compelled to do 
anything else. 

Under conditions of life in America, the best we 
can hope to do will be, as the English statesman 
said, "to muddle through." It strikes us that in the 
end vocational education will be fatal to Democracy. 
It will leave all higher culture to the few who have 
wealth and leisure, or who have force and determi- 
nation enough to acquire it in spite of circumstances. 
Fortunately, genius, whose flowering seems to be 
the one certain purpose of life, is usually strong 
enough to force its way up through the hardest and 
most barren soil ; though doubtless it flourishes best 
where the ground is prepared to nourish and dis-

CASUAL COMMENT. 



HUMOR IN LETTERS is like apples of gold in 
pictures of silver; it is humor in the very best set- 
ting that could be found for it. Accordingly one is 
pleased to find even an occasional outcropping of 
this vein amid the fine scholarship and exquisite taste 
that characterize Charles Eliot Norton's familiar cor- 
respondence (as published in the two rich volumes 
elsewhere reviewed in this issue). In a letter to 
Lowell in 1856, written in the Isle of Wight, Norton 
says, of London climatic conditions: "We had a fog 
there one day last week that was of a sort to keep 
up the reputation of this portion of the British Con- 
stitution. Old men who had gone down to the city 
every day of their lives got lost in the Strand, found 
themselves near Westminster Hall when they thought 
they were approaching Temple Bar. The robbers 
could not find the marks that Ali Baba had chalked 
up on the doors. Cabmen could not find the Bank, 
and Sir James Clark, who was to have gone to an 
important consultation, struggled vainly for three 
hours and then had to feel his way home. Even the 
blind beggars could not see approaching passengers 
and had the fog lasted two days longer half London 
would have been starved. But fine weather set in 
next day with a heavy rain." At a much later period, 
little more than a month before he died, we find 
dashes of humor, of a subtler and rarer flavor, in a 
letter to the congenial friend of his old age, Horace 
Howard Furness. Here is a random passage, again 



touching on things meteorological: "I agree with 
your boys in being glad that you did not have the 
chance to see and feel a West India hurricane. Even 
the sight of cows and chickens carried through the 
air would not make up for the horror of such an 
extravagant exhibition of the powers of nature. I 
do not like these noisy, violent convulsions of such 
uncontrollable forces. I feel as old Dr. Popkin did 
in regard to the character of the Greek tragedies, 
' They are too horrible.' He liked to see, as he said, 
everybody peaceful and happy, and I like to see 
Nature in her calm and beautiful moods rather than 
in her passionate excesses." Calm and beautiful are 
the moods in which Norton wrote his letters, and his 
wit and humor glow with a gentle radiance, never 
coruscate in blinding flashes. 



THE BIRTH OF A NEW WORD, when the new word 
supplies a real need, is cause for rejoicing; but the 
careless introduction into the language of barbarous 
or hybrid or otherwise philologically objectionable 
terms is a thing to be deprecated. An offender 
already familiar to many is the verb "enthuse," 
which is being more and more freely used in both 
a neuter and an active sense. In a late number of 
"The Newarker" occurs this sentence: "They 
were stimulated and enthused by their communion 
with the live thinkers and workers of the world." 
A noteworthy publication of the season, Patience 
Pennington's "A Woman Rice Planter," which, 
even without its highly commendatory introduction 
from Mr. Owen Wister's pen, would win its way in 
the world, has at least one of its fair pages dis- 
figured with this vulgarism, used in all deliberation 
and seriousness ; and the otherwise admirable 
"Picture Tales from Welsh Hills," by Miss Bertha 
Thomas, cools the cordiality of our welcome by giv- 
ing its sanction to this misbegotten monster of a 
word. Why it is to be called misbegotten will be 
made plain by a little reflection or a brief study of 
the dictionary. Enthusiasm (or, in Greek, enthou- 
siasmos) is connected with the Greek verb enthou- 
siazein ; and the corresponding English verb, if we 
must have it, would be enthusiaze, just as we have 
dogmatize, from the Greek dogmatixein. To dog- 
mat would be just as allowable as to enthuse; and 
if we permit ourselves to enthuse and to be enthused, 
why should we not ecstase our neighbors and be 
ecstased by them? But the truth is, there is no 
call for any of these grotesque absurdities. We 
have the verbs, stimulate, animate, kindle, excite, 
electrify; and we have no need of enthuse. Never- 
theless, it has already secured a foothold in the 
language, and it would be safe to predict its unquali- 
fied recognition in the next edition of "Webster." 

THE DEATH OF MRS. SAMUEL J. BARROWS, 
October 25, calls renewed attention to her recent 
admirable biography of her husband, whose death 
preceded hers by four years and six months. "A

proud to have dedicated to his memory. Mrs. Bar-

rows was a remarkable woman. She was born at 
Irasburg, Vt., April 17, 1845; was educated at the 
Adams Academy, Derry, N. H., studied medicine 
in New York, Leipzig, and Vienna, and for a while 
practiced as an oculist. But journalism and other 
literary work drew her from her first profession into 
the ranks of writers. She was the first woman stenog- 
rapher ever employed by the State Department at 
Washington; she also served as phonographic sec- 
retary of the National Prison Association, and for 
seventeen years as secretary of the Lake Mohonk 
Conference and editor of its publications. For twenty 
years she assisted her husband in the editorship of 
"The Christian Register," Boston, and at different 
times contributed editorials to "The Independent," 
"The Outlook," the New York "Evening Post," 
"The Survey," and "other journals. With Mr. Bar- 
rows she wrote "The Shay backs in Camp," that early 
and still unsurpassed example of back-to-nature lit- 
erature. And with all these activities she found 
time to be a wife and mother ; in fact, she was twice 
married, first at eighteen to William Wilberforce 
Chapin, a missionary in India, who died two years 
later, and then, in 1867, to Samuel June Barrows, 
whose record of manifold and notable achievement 
it was her privilege and pleasure to make public in 
"A Sunny Life." 

THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND'S ACADEMIC COM- 
MITTEE,, which has bravely survived the jests and 
sarcasms directed against it at the time of its forma- 
tion in the summer of 1910, looks bright to Mr. 
Edmund Gosse, himself not the least eminent mem- 
ber of that body. In the current "Edinburgh 
Review" he begins an article on "The Foundation 
of the French Academy " with a few words on the 
similar but much younger institution in his own 
country, of which he says that " now, for more than 
three years, without claiming any excessive publicity, 
this Academic Committee, founded for the protection 
and encouragement of a pure English style in prose 
and verse, has occupied a position in letters which 
gives every evidence of persisting and increasing. 
It was assailed, as was natural and right, by satire 
and by caricature, but it has survived the attacks 
which were directed against it, and there can be 
little doubt that, with good luck, it will become a 
prominent feature of our intellectual and social 
system." Already, as he reminds his readers, the 
initial thirty-three have suffered losses that confer 
a certain solemnity, a certain increase of dignity, 
upon the young academy. Butcher, Verrall, Alfred 
Lyall, Andrew Lang, and Edward Dowden have 
followed one another to the grave in rather quick 
succession ; and both their fellows on the Committee 
and the larger world still feel their loss. 


HELPS TO READ was the old name sometimes 
applied to spectacles, and the passing years give 
most of us abundant proof of the appositeness of 
that designation. But an even greater help in read- 
ing, or rather a prime necessity, is a good light on 



the matter under perusal. The late convention of 
the National Gas Institute has called attention to 
the marked progress made in artificial illumination 
within the last few years, and it may also serve to 
remind us of the defects and also the excesses even 
now prevalent in our modes of lighting the printed 
page when inclination or necessity protracts our 
studies beyond the limits of daylight. It is a com- 
mon assumption that the stronger the artificial light, 
the nearer its approach to the illumination enjoyed 
from the sun, and hence the better for the eyes. 
But the assumption is erroneous. Sunlight is dif- 
fused, and unless turned directly upon the page 
before one is far less trying to the eyes than an 
equal amount of artificial light shining immediately 
upon the book or paper in hand. Hence the impor- 
tance of choosing a somewhat subdued light, like 
that of a good oil lamp, for reading, and of seeing 
that its rays are directed so as not to be reflected 
from the white paper into the eyes. As every 
schoolboy knows, and he need not be one of Macau- 
lay's schoolboys in order to know it, the angle of 
reflection is equal to the angle of incidence; and 
also highly glazed or "sized" paper is ruinous to 
eyesight; and, lastly, just as water dropping day by 
day will wear the hardest stone away, so a repeated 
disregard of proper rules for reading will in time 
reduce the strongest eyes to a condition prohibitive 
of any reading at all. 



FIFTY YEARS OF A LIBRARIAN'S LIFE form the 
link inseparably associating the name of Dr. Philip 
R. Uhler with the Peabody Institute Library of 
Baltimore. But it was science rather than letters 
that first made Dr. Uhler a worker among books. 
Born in 1835 at Baltimore, he early became familiar 
with country life, his father having bought a farm 
near Reisterstown, and he was especially drawn to 
the study of insects. Entering the service of the 
newly-started Peabody Institute in 1862, he attracted 
by his talents the attention of the elder Agassiz, who 
invited him to Cambridge to work in the great 
naturalist's museum of comparative zoology as as- 
sistant librarian, and afterward sent him to make 
explorations in Hayti. In 1867 the young entomol- 
ogist was again at the Peabody Institute, acting as 
assistant librarian and, upon leave of absence, pur- 
suing entomological researches in Colorado. The 
head librarianship came to him in 1870, and in 
1890 he was also made Provost of the Institute. 
Other dignities and numerous memberships in 
learned societies fell to his share as the years 
passed, but the best of his energies were devoted to 
the fine library in his charge, and he left his mark 
upon it in the modern system of cataloguing and 
classification that he introduced, and in the notable 
additions he made to its store of books, spending 
much time in Europe in quest of these works. 
Among his amiable peculiarities, of which many 
stories are told, was his readiness to grant leave of 
absence to an assistant wishing to attend a church 
picnic, and his hesitation in granting such leave when

the less joyous function of a burial was in question. 
He died October 21, after a retirement of two years, 
and is succeeded in the librarianship by his long-time 
assistant, Mr. John Parker. 



FIRST AID TO THE FOREIGNER, in his attempt to 
find his bearings in a new country, may often be 
best rendered by the public library. At a recent 
conference of educational and other workers at 
Springfield, Mass., discussion turned upon the best 
way to make the public library serviceable to the 
immigrant population. The lowly toiler of alien 
birth is seldom seen in the splendid halls of our city 
libraries. The books he needs and desires may be 
there, and the attendants eager and willing to serve 
him; but he does not come. Hence the necessity, 
as was urged, of a system of small branch libraries 
at the very doors of the foreign families, and with 
books in their several tongues served to them by 
assistants speaking those tongues. A small room, 
open an hour or two in the evening, will often do 
better service of this sort than a Carnegie library 
that employs a score of assistants and holds its 
doors open from eight in the morning till ten at 
night. The less awe-inspiring and formal the ap- 
pearance and methods of these branches or stations 
among the immigrants, the better will be the results 
attained ; and from these humble training schools in 
library usage the Italian, the Hungarian, the Greek, 
and the Lithuanian are likely to graduate in time 
and find themselves fitted to avail themselves of the 
larger privileges of the central library ; or at least 
their children are pretty sure to do so. 



PRICE COLLIER, AUTHOR, SPORTSMAN, AND 
TRAVELLER, whose "Germany and the Germans 
from an American Point of View" is one of the 
more important books of the season, died suddenly 
on the third of this month in the island of Funen, in 
the Baltic Sea, where he was visiting Count Weddel 
as member of a shooting party. He was born in 
1860, son of the Rev. Robert Laird Collier, and was 
educated at Geneva and Leipzig, but fitted for the 
ministry at the Harvard Divinity School. After 
brief pastorates at Hingham and Brookline, Mass., 
he devoted himself to letters, acting as European 
editor of "The Forum" for two years, writing 
many magazine articles, and issuing a number of 
books, chiefly concerning his travels. He wrote 
also the volume on driving in Macmillan's " Sports- 
man's Library." Of his books not already noted, 
mention should be made of "America and the Amer- 
icans from a French Point of View," "England 
and the English from an American Point of View," 
and "The West in the East from an American Point 
of View." He held an officer's commission in the 
United States Navy in the Spanish- American War. 
Briskness, vigor, and alert observation showed 
themselves in his entertaining chapters of travel and 
foreign sojourn. 



A MONUMENT TO HENRI FABRE, the tardily rec- 
ognized genius whose researches in the insect world 
have proved him to be a naturalist and a thinker of 
rare insight and vision, will probably add not very 
much to the happiness of his remaining years, but 
it will at least gratify his increasing company of ad- 
mirers and the chosen few admitted to his intimate 
friendship to see his fame perpetuated not only in 
his books, themselves a monumentum cere peren- 
nius, but also in some suitable erection of stone or 
bronze bearing his name and effigy. To this end a 
committee headed by the Mayor of Se"rignan, and 
numbering many French notables, has beeif formed, 
and a circular sent out in solicitation of subscrip- 
tions. It is hoped that the response will be prompt 
and generous. 



THE LITERARY AGENT IN ENGLAND. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
I am, unfortunately, old enough to remember the 
days when the Literary Agent made his first appearance 
in the world of writers, and was hailed with enthusiasm 
by the authors of that epoch as the harbinger of brighter 
days. For in those far-off times the Man of Letters 
knew himself to be no Man of Business : he confessed it 
even with a sort of pride. What had a writer of books 
to do with this pettifogging affair of getting paid for 
the books he produced? The publisher gave him some- 
thing for his trouble, and it was not the part of an artist 
or of a gentleman to cavil at the amount. We still had 
our literary traditions, dating from the days when Lord 
Byron considered it beneath his dignity to receive re- 
muneration for his copyrights. Mr. R. C. Dallas, who 
arranged for the publication of " Childe Harold " with 
John Murray, divided the profits of that transaction 
with the publisher. In a sense, he may be counted as 
the first Literary Agent of whom we have actual knowl- 
edge, and he was well rewarded for his pains. Our 
authors to-day are beginning to complain about the far 
more modest rate of commission charged by his suc- 
cessors in a growing trade. 

The Literary Agent, I suppose, evolved himself out 
of the Literary Executor. It was early recognized as a 
convenience that some duly authorized person, with some 
knowledge of business as well as of letters, should take 
over the task of collecting and publishing such stray 
fragments a"S might be left inedited at the writer's death. 
His pay varied. Sometimes it was considered that the 
honor of his position (with the opportunity of writing 
an Authorised Biography) furnished sufficient remu- 
neration; sometimes, on the other hand, the materials 
were left to him absolutely to use at his own discretion 
and for his own profit. Out of this welter of confusion 
emerged by slow degrees the great principle of the Ten 
Per Cent commission, in defence of which the agent of 
to-day is prepared to fight to the last gasp. It looks 
as though he may have to fight, too. 

For a long time, when his business was still a novelty, 
the Literary Agent received nothing but praise from the 
authors who employed him. Successful novelists used 
to button-hole their less successful brethren at clubs, 
and urge them, with tears in their eyes, to follow the 
path that led so easily to glory and increased royalties. 
And, one by one, the conservative gentlemen of the old

school, who exist in literature as in other professions, 
fell into line and began to talk about "my agent" with a 
pleasant sense of business acumen. It really was a great 
point to have a representative who could be trusted to 
do the unpleasant part of the business, who could ap- 
proach the selling of a book without being hampered by 
any absurd considerations of sentiment, or any ridiculous 
qualms of nervousness. The publisher, of course, made 
a fuss over the innovation: he talked a good deal about 
the good old times when there was a real friendship be- 
tween author and publisher; he trotted out a number of 
musty old stories about generous publishers of the past 
who had gone beyond the terms of their original agree- 
ments and handed over cheques for large amounts to 
writers who had made an unexpected success. He 
instanced firms who had undertaken, and paid liberally 
for, works that could not be expected to show a profit. 
This sort of thing, he intimated in conclusion, could 
not be expected to continue if the Literary Agent were 
allowed to interpose himself as a middleman. In a very 
little time the publisher would be squeezed dry: not a 
drop of the milk of human kindness would be left in 
him. In effect, he desired to point out that the author 
could not have it both ways. Either let him be a friend, 
or a grasping man of business; if he chose to be the lat- 
ter (by proxy) he must not complain if he were treated 
according to the strict letter of the agreement. In 
short, the author must not expect any more cheques by 
way of bonus if he employed an agent to make his 
agreements. 

The author, I regret to say, made fun of these pro- 
testations in a manner that must have caused his old 
friend and ally considerable pain. He said rudely that 
he did not want his friendship: that he preferred the 
cash ; and that this so-called friendship, in any case, had 
been merely a cloak behind which the publisher had been 
wont to conceal his avaricious and grasping hands. It 
was now the author's turn, and he meant to do a little 
squeezing on his own account. I must admit that he 
triumphed rather too openly for my taste ; he displayed 
something too much of that exultant pride so distaste- 
ful to the Greek tragedians; it was felt that he was pre- 
paring a whip for the Fates to use upon himself in his 
turn. And yet it is difficult to blame him severely. The 
sudden acquisition of money is at least as intoxicating 
as strong drink. And for centuries the author had been 
kept very short of cash. Since Samuel Johnson first 
turned for support from the patron to the bookseller, 
the capitalist had no doubt enjoyed the better share of 
the bargain. But then, the capitalist generally succeeds 
in business; if he fails, he soon ceases to be a capitalist. 
I do not know that the publisher had behaved worse to 
the author than the employer in general had to his 
laborers. But of late years Labor has been showing a 
decided tendency to squeeze Capital, and it was not to 
be expected that authors (whose work, after all, demands 
a modicum of brains) should lag behind their brother 
operatives. They could not very well organize a strike, 
but at least they could sell their wares to the highest 
bidder, and employ a man of business to superintend 
the sale and the subsequent collection of money that 
might become due. 

There are now, I suppose, some dozen or more Literary 
Agents of repute settled in this city of London. There 
are many more, no doubt, whose methods will not bear 
investigation, men who live upon the fees they con- 
trive to extract from young authors before they make 
any pretence of exhibiting their work to editors or 



publishers. But the few who are perched securely at 
the top of the tree have done very well for them- 
selves, so well that the author, forgetful of the 
benefits he has reaped from their services in the past, 
is already beginning to turn round and ask why he 
should pay these high rates of commission for work 
that he could (as he sometimes says) do as easily him- 
self. Recently " The Author," which is the official 
organ of the Incorporated Society of Authors in this 
country, and is always ready to open its columns to 
the grievances, real or imaginary, of those who write, 
has been dealing with this matter of a ten per cent 
commission for the mere collecting of accounts. With 
the accumulation of wealth, it may be noted, Avarice 
increases. The author does not think of grumbling at 
the agent who deducts a sovereign from a ten pound 
account, or even ten pounds from a hundred; but when 
the amounts begin to run into higher figures he asks 
himself if the middleman is so indispensable after all. 
And of course the agent is by no means indispensable; 
he is merely a convenience. There are not wanting 
authors of eminence who declare roundly that they will 
have none of him, that they can manage their own 
affairs without his assistance, at a saving both in tem- 
per and in pocket. Mr. H. G. Wells and Mr. Hall 
Caine are two of the most important writers who have 
thus declared their independence; on the other hand, 
Mr. Arnold Bennett has acknowledged eloquently his 
indebtedness to the tribe of agents, and Mr. Charles 
Garvice assures us that the more his commission 
account comes to the better he is pleased. Which 
seems, on the face of it, a reasonable enough way of 
looking at the matter. 

The agent has done so much for the author during 
the last twenty years that it seems the basest ingrati- 
tude to cavil at the amount of his profit. It is all very 
well for the successful novelist to allege that he can 
make better terms for himself with the publishers, but 
it was the agent who showed him the way to do so. 
Yet it may be that the middleman has now become 
somewhat careless in the performance of his trust. 
Complaints are beginning to be made now that, when 
once the contract has been drawn up for the publication 
of a book or the production of a drama, the agent does 
nothing more to earn his commission. He does not, for 
example, keep his eye upon publisher or producer to 
see that the terms of the contract are fulfilled. In 
cases where there is delay in the furnishing of accounts 
(and publishers on this side of the Atlantic are often 
unconscionably slow in payment of royalties) the agent 
is too apt, they say, to make excuses. He has even 
been known to urge that, if he presses too hardly for 
immediate settlement, he may prejudice his position as 
to the placing of other manuscripts. When the accounts 
do at last come in, it is stated that they are too often 
not in accordance with the agreements. In short, the 
author is oppressed with doubts whether his new servant 
is not attempting the difficult task of serving two mas- 
ters. It is remarkable that the publisher no longer 
displays the old objection to the agent. Cases have 
been reported where, indeed, he has expressed a prefer- 
ence for dealing with them rather than with the author 
direct. This, not unnaturally, has given rise to horrid 
suspicions. What consideration does the publisher 
receive from the agent to induce this attitude ? Some- 
how he seems to have made terms with his ancient 
enemy, and the soul of the author is vexed within him. 
The agent is suspected now of acting as principal, of

having a financial interest in some of the firms with 
whom he deals. 

But the root of all this trouble is, I imagine, nothing 
but the ten per cent commission. It goes on and on: 
there is no getting rid of it; it is as certain as the 
income tax, and, like the income tax, it is deducted 
before the payment of dividends. So long as a book 
continues to sell, so long do the royalties come in shorn 
of their just amount by one-tenth. There will have 
to be an amending of the contract, and a time limit. 
The weak point of the author's position under the 
existing arrangement is that he has not (unless he has 
made some special arrangement) any power to stop his 
agent from collecting royalties on any work that has 
been once put in his hands and placed by his efforts. 
In his view, the placing of a book and the collection 
of the royalties thereon should be set in different cate- 
gories, and the author should have the power to take 
the latter function out of his agent's hands after a cer- 
tain agreed minimum had been reached. The point is 
one that is not likely to interest any but the successful 
writer; but it interests him very much indeed.

C OMMUNICA TIONS. 



MILTON'S " STARRE-YPOINTING PYRAMID." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence's letter, in your last 
issue, on Milton's epitaph on Shakespeare seems to call 
for a reply even if for no other purpose than to show 
up the methods of Baconians when they set out to prove 
their obsession and the flimsy foundation whereon they 
build. 

Says Sir Edwin, " starre-ypointing has been the despair 
of English grammarians for more than 250 years . . . 
because y, like the German ge, is never prefixed to a 
present participle, but only to a past participle." The 
augment ge has, as we know, wholly disappeared from 
modern English, notwithstanding its great popularity 
before the Norman Conquest. If Sir Edwin means that 
ge was limited to past participles he is mistaken; there 
is absolutely no question that during its lifetime ge was 
prefixed to any part of the verb. In later English the 
inflectional ge was reduced or softened to y (e. g., yclad, 
yclept, ysterved, etc.), i (e. g., iwis = gewiss) or e (e. g., 
enough = genug). So our beloved is the Saxon gelufed, 
belief is gelyfan, become (= to suit) is gecweman, belong 
is geiang, beseech is gesecan, beholden is gehealden, etc. 
This be, the representative of the old ge, occurs in numer- 
ous modern and Elizabethan infinitives and present parti- 
ciples. In Shakespeare we find the present participle 
beholding (= obligated) some twenty times, and the past 
participle beholder, not at all, some of his modern editors 
to the contrary notwithstanding. There is therefore 
nothing astounding in Milton's " starre-ypointing," as- 
suming that he wrote that and not, as has been con- 
jectured," starry-pointing." Starre-ypointed was as much 
an archaism in Milton's day as starre-ypointing. 

Sir Edwin makes much of the fact that only a few of 
the extant copies of the Second Folio read " starre- 
ypointed," a fact from which he draws the " obvious " 
conclusion that cancel pages containing the corrected 
reading " could have been " issued only to those pur- 
chasers of the volume to whom had been entrusted the 



preservation of Bacon's secrets. "The page reveals to us, 
and it was intended to reveal to us, the name of the 
real author of the plays." Of course it does. Does 
not Milton explicitly say, "What neede my Shakespeare 
. . . that his hallowed Reliques should be hid Under 
a starre-ypointed Pyramid ? " But this is too simple for 
Sir Edwin; "reliques," he says, "must mean what he 
hath left us "; but common sense says it means the poet's 
mortal remains, his "honour'd bones." "A starre-ypointed 
Pyramid," continues Sir Edwin, " can only [stc] mean a 
pyramid with a star upon its apex, i. e., a Beacon, pro- 
nounced Bacon," although common sense says that a 
star-ypointing (or ypointed) pyramid means a monu- 
ment pointing to or directed at the stars. But it is not 
impossible, nay, it is highly probable, that Milton meant 
a monument so high that it seemed to touch the stars 
or to be surmounted by a star. Not even such a monu- 
ment could add one inch to " the great Heire of Fame." 

Moreover, Sir Edwin's paraphrase of "hallowed 
Reliques " as the immortal plays cannot be right be- 
cause Milton would never have applied the adjective 
hallowed to profane writings, not even to Shakespeare's. 
Hallowed does not, and never did, mean immortal. 

In no English dictionary known to me is " beacon " 
defined as a " pyramid with a star upon its point." 
Then how could any owner of the corrected Second 
Folio, unless he were a Baconian looking for such 
skimble-skamble stuff, know that the " starre-ypointed 
Pyramid " meant " a Beacon, pronounced Bacon " ? 
Furthermore, even if, for the sake of argument, we 
admit that beacon was then pronounced like our bacon, 
that proves nothing, for it is more than likely that 
" Bacon " was then pronounced the way we would pro- 
nounce " backon" or "bahcon." 

"What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name?" 
means only " Thou needst no such dull testimony as 
that offered by a pyramid of piled stones to witness thy 
fame," and not that it was not " necessary to put the 
dull witness of a Beacon (Bacon) upon these marvellous 
works." 

That the Third Folio retains the word " starre- 
ypointing " is due to the fact that this edition of the 
poet's works was set up from an uncorrected copy of 
the Second Folio, and that the editors, not being of the 
" initiated," saw nothing ungrammatical in starre- 
ypointing. SAMUEL A. TANNEXBAUM.

"A PILGRIMAGE OF PLEASURE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With reference to the note on Swinburne's "A Pil- 
grimage of Pleasure," in your issue of Nov. 1, it may 
interest your readers to know that in a third edition of 
" The Children of the Chapel " by Mrs. Disney Leith 
(the poet's cousin), published by Messrs. Chatto & 
Windus, London, in 1910, it was definitely stated that 
the morality play was by Swinburne. The title-page 
of this issue reads as follows : " The Children of the 
Chapel by Mrs. Disney Leith, including The Pilgrimage 
of Pleasure, a morality play by Algernon Charles 
Swinburne." No mention of this third edition is made 
in Mr. O'Brien's Bibliography. 

The " Spectator " letter of 1862 was reprinted for 
the first time in Mr. R. Le Gallienne's " George Mere- 
dith: Some Characteristics " (Lane, 1890), and in sub- 
sequent editions. w. MACDONALD MACKAY.

A HERO OF THE GENTLE LIFE.* 



In closing his "Literary Friends and Ac- 
quaintance," written while Charles Eliot Norton 
was still alive, Mr. Howells speaks, with the 
restraint he knew would be desired by Mr. 
Norton, of "the creative sympathy of a man 
whose contributions to our literature only par- 
tially represent what he has constantly done for 
the humanities," and adds: "I am sure that 
after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot, 
and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall 
dwindle to their essential insignificance before 
these of the gentle life, we shall see in Charles 
Eliot Norton, the eminent scholar who left the 
quiet of his books to become our chief citizen 
at the moment when he warned his countrymen 
of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong." 
Somewhere else, unless memory is at fault, the 
same writer points to Mr. Norton as the finest 
example of one whose scholarly capacities have 
been cultivated to their fullest extent. 

It is this impression of continual growth in 
scholarship and refined taste and high sym- 
pathies that one receives in reading the two 
ample volumes of Mr. Norton's letters now 
carefully edited with biographical comment by 
his daughter, Miss Sara Norton, and Mr. M. A. 
De Wolfe Howe. First we see their writer 
young, ardent, eagerly acquisitive of knowledge 
and experience, and then, as the wisdom of age 
is added, reflective, reminiscent, philosophical, 
tasting the wine of life with a more keenly dis- 
criminating relish, infusing himself more and 
more into the generations growing up about him, 
and, in his letters to old friends, falling back at 
last on those mutual sympathies and comprehen- 
sions that are finally felt to be the really endur- 
ing and desirable things of existence. From the 
very beginning, too, he shows himself possessed 
of a singular maturity and poise, a capacity 
for inspiring confidence as an adviser and for 
winning hearts as a friend. Indeed, he had a 
veritable genius for friendship, high and noble, 
warm and lasting friendship, and it is signifi- 
cant that many of his earlier friends were men 
and women considerably older than himself. 
Reared as the companion rather than the son of 
a scholarly father, he early displayed an unusual 
development of mental powers, strength of

ical comment by his daughter, Sara Norton, and M. A. De 
Wolfe Howe. In two volumes. Illustrated. Boston:

character, and ripeness of judgment. Ruskin's 
attachment to and confidence in Norton is well 
known. In his " Praeterita," after describing 
their first meeting on that memorable day in 
Switzerland, he concludes : " And thus I became 
possessed of my second friend, after Dr. John 
Brown ; and of my first real tutor, Charles Eliot 
Norton." The relationship of the two is well 
shown in the letters from Ruskin to Norton, as 
published a few years ago. An uninformed 
reader would not suspect the age of the " tutor " 
to be almost nine years under that of the 
pupil. Another Englishman of note who con- 
fessed himself indebted to the young American 
scholar's benevolence and wisdom, was Arthur 
Hugh Clough, also Norton's senior by nearly 
nine years. "Charles Norton is the kindest 
creature in the shape of a young man of twenty- 
five that ever befriended an emigrant stranger 
anywhere," writes Clough from Cambridge, 
where Norton was sagely advising him on the 
publication of his "Plutarch" and aiding him 
in reading the proofs. 

Striking instances of Norton's happy way of 
quickly ingratiating himself, without effort, 
wherever he went and whomsoever he met, are 
found in the record of his first journey abroad, 
that memorable voyage made by him as super- 
cargo to India, whence he returned, nearly two 
years later, by way of Suez, Cairo, and Europe. 
In Italy the Brownings appear to have felt his 
charm immediately, and to have given him their 
cordial friendship. The younger man's way of 
referring to Browning and other friends older 
than himself, and of addressing them in his let- 
ters, using often only the last name, is significant 
of his reception among them on a footing of 
perfect equality. That he viewed under no false 
glamour the celebrities among whom he moved 
and of whom he heard, is evident from such 
passages as the following, written to his mother 
after a tete-a-tete dinner with John Kenyon, 
Mrs. Browning's elderly cousin : 

" We talked much this evening of Coleridge and of 
Wordsworth. Mr. Kenyon said that much as he ad- 
mired and respected Wordsworth, there was hardly a 
more disagreeable man in some positions; that he was 
very selfish, and, as Sara Coleridge said of him, his sen- 
sibility seemed to be in him and not of him. Coleridge 
once said that if Wordsworth had a coat of arms, the 
crest should be a laurel crown, and the supporters, a 
bishop on the one side, and an attorney on the other. 
He was a man weak enough to care for the distinctions 
of rank, and to bow to them, and if you, his best friend, 
said Mr. Kenyon, met him in a party of lords and bishops, 
it was very likely that he would not know you while they 
were in the room. We talked, too, of Rogers, of Miss 
Mitford, who is still living at Three Mile Cross, and

who, being relieved from the necessity of writing, has 
laid aside her pen, to live quietly on her narrow but 
sufficient income." 

Side by side with this dinner at John Kenyon's 
should be placed Norton's evening at Lamar- 
tine's, where the clear-eyed young American 
detected at once the enormous vanity of his host. 
"The stories which are heard of Lamartine's 
vanity," he wrote home afterward, "would be 
almost incredible were they not confirmed and 
repeated on every side. Some of them are too 
bad to tell. By a little skilful drawing out one 
can any day induce him to say that he is physi- 
cally superb and morally sublime." But it is 
more profitable to dwell on Norton's admirations 
and enthusiasms than on the objects of his good- 
natured contempt though that is too strong a 
word to describe his feeling. An early reference 
to the dearest friend of his maturity and later 
life occurs in a letter to Clough, written in Nor- 
ton's twenty-sixth year and while Lowell .was 
still keenly feeling the loss of his first wife. 

" Lowell was with me last night till near one o'clock, 
so that if I am stupid this morning there is no cause 
for wonder ; he was very bright and pleasant and we 
should neither of us be dull to-day, could we have sat 
talking all night and not gone to bed at all. My affec- 
tion and admiration for him quicken every time I see 
him; he bears the trial of his life, a loss which grows 
only more palpable in the course of time, with the best 
spirit, and the truest right feeling. Sometimes, after he 
has been long at home, surrounded only by those things 
which suggest continually to him his sorrow, I have 
found him very sad ; but he quickly rallies, and no word 
of unmanliness or complaint ever shows that he has 
lost even for a moment the serenity and patience of his 
heart." 

An earlier letter to the same correspondent has 
a paragraph prophetic of the writer's attitude in 
a national crisis of almost half a century later, 
and not unprofitable reading for us at this very 
moment. 

" The administration have got a very pretty quarrel 
with Cuba, and will make the most of it. One of the 
New York steamers has been confiscated in Havana 
owing to informality in her manifest. The accounts as 
yet are all from one side and we have not heard the 
Spanish version of the story. But we do not care to wait 
for that and propose to seek redress whether Spanish 
laws are violated or not. Such an opportunity as this 
cannot be lost. So the President sends an undignified 
message to Congress, and all the passion that can be ex- 
cited is being stimulated by every proper means. . . . 
In the existing state of feeling in this country in regard 
to Cuba it was, so far as can be now seen, an immense 
mistake on the part of the Spanish authorities to commit 
such an inflammatory act as the seizure of this vessel." 

In a notebook kept by Norton at the time of 
his second visit to Europe there are found 
entries indicating the beginning of that course 
of study which was to make the young student, 



in process of time, our foremost Dante scholar. 
From 1856, therefore, to the end of his life 
more than half a century later, Norton is to be 
thought of as giving the best of his intellectual 
energies to the Italian poet. That his prose 
rendering of the "Divine Comedy" should be 
accounted the most faithful presentation of it 
in our language, need not surprise anyone who 
knows the translator's lifelong abhorrence of 
slovenliness in literary work. 

A passage from a letter to Mr. Edward Lee- 
Childe arrests attention because it so aptly 
applies to the writer himself. 

" You are leading a rational life, and in securing the 
best culture for yourself you are doing good service to 
society. There is great need of men who may keep up 
the standard of cultivation, without aiming at the cheap 
personal distinction for which most men strive. I know 
no worse calamity that can overtake a man than to have 
a thirst for publicity, and yet it is the common vice of 
able men in this epoch of the newspaper reporter." 

Passing now to the later letters, we select a 
passage from a communication to Gold win 
Smith that reveals a healthy rationalism and a 
sane optimism such as not all the world has yet 
attained to. 

" You gave me a great pleasure in sending to me 
two or three months ago a copy of your book on the 
' Riddle of Existence.' It was a great satisfaction to 
me to find myself in entire agreement with you on 
every main point, and to have my own convictions set 
forth with such lucidity, temperance, and force. Possibly 
I regret less than you do the giving up of the old faith, 
and the being compelled to renounce as hopeless every 
attempt to solve the problems which excite our curi- 
osity. The position toward the universe in which we 
find ourselves seems to me on the whole the manliest 
which has been attained. We are thrown back on our 
own resources to make the best of our lives. A new 
sense of responsibility is aroused in us, and, by the 
narrowing of the limits of our hopes and expectations, 
we find ourselves more capable of using our faculties 
for legitimate and rational ends. I do not find it hard 
to quench the eagerness of curiosity about the unknow- 
able, and to accept as sufficient this brief, incompre- 
hensible existence on earth. Man seems to me to be 
for the most part in a very early stage of development, 
and the loss of religious faith among the most civilized 
portion of the race is a step from childishness toward 
maturity. That it will have many sad results I do not 
question, that the progress will be very slow and irreg- 
ular is certain, but in the long run I have no fear in 
regard to improvement in the general morality of the 
race. Our morals seem to me the result and expression 
of the secular experience of mankind. As such they 
have a solid foundation. The doctrine of love is the 
one ultimate achievement in this field. And the validity 
of that doctrine as the rule of life is but confirmed by 
such convictions as you and I have reached." 

In one of his last letters Norton cheerfully 
wrote : " The end cannot be far off, and although 
few men have more to leave than I, I am neither

reluctant, nor sentimentally sorry to leave it." 
Among those last letters, which are, naturally 
enough, the best letters in the collection, one 
finds and would like to quote from many a 
genial message of greeting to such sympathetic 
friends as Leslie Stephen, E. L. Godkin, Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, 
and Horace Howard Furness. Following the 
letters are twenty pages of delightful personal 
reminiscence from Mr. Arthur Sedgwick, Nor- 
ton's brother-in-law ; then come appended items 
of interest, and, finally, an index that success- 
fully stands the test of repeated use. Portraits 
and other illustrations abound. Even more 
memorable than the appearance of Lowell's 
correspondence, which Norton himself edited, 
is this publication of the letters of him who was 
our most finished scholar and our most intelli- 
gently and fearlessly public-spirited citizen. In 
the best sense of those much abused words, this 
is emphatically the book of the year.

THE SOCIAL, DEVELOPMENT or MODERN 
ENGLAND.* 



The past century of English history has been 
a period of great and growing "unrest." As 
the years pass the disturbing forces appear to 
be increasing in number and strength. The 
situation has produced much perplexity among 
conservative Britons, and has inspired a con- 
siderable body of literature largely of the 
polemic order. Among the more recent works 
that have been called forth by these newer 
social facts is a historical study by Dr. Gilbert 
Slater, which he calls " The Making of Modern 
England." Dr. Slater belongs to a class of 
writers who sometimes speak of themselves as 
"sociological historians" (whatever that term 
may mean), and whose interest seems to be 
limited to the larger and wider aspects of social 
life and development. For such a study the 
recent history of England is surely not wanting 
in opportunity. 

The author states his purpose clearly in a 
brief preface from which the following sen- 
tences may be quoted : 

" My aim in this book is to set out in language as 
simple and clear as I can command those facts with 
regard to the recent history of our country which it is 
most important for English men and women to know. 
... For the citizen, historical study with the ulterior 
object of gaining light in the future and guidance in 

*THE MAKING OF MODERN ENGLAND. By Gilbert 
Slater, M.A., D.Sc. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



the present, is an imperative duty. ... I should have 
liked to lavish much more time and labor on this effort 
if it had been possible. As it is, I must now present 
it, for what it is worth, to those who are seeking for 
light from the past on the difficulties and dangers of 
this most critical moment in the life of our nation, of 
the empire, and of humanity." 

Dr. Slater is principal of Ruskin College, an 
Oxford institution which is frequently spoken 
of as " the workingmen's college "; it was organ- 
ized a dozen years ago to give certain opportu- 
nities for study both in residence, by "extension" 
courses, and by correspondence, that were not 
to be found elsewhere. This position has brought 
the author into close touch with the most 
discontented of all the disturbing forces, the 
workingmen. But it has also given him a view- 
point that the " more solid classes " will refuse 
to accept. There are no traces of Tory sym- 
pathies in Dr. Slater's work. 

"The Making of Modern England" is not a 
history in the traditional sense: the political 
element, which surely has had a large part in 
the " making " of that nation, is almost omitted. 
Only where politics and politicians are associa- 
ted with great social or industrial changes do 
they appear in the narrative; the first reform 
act, which paved the way for the social reforms 
of the thirties, is naturally treated in some 
detail. Gladstone and Chamberlain are prom- 
inent in Dr. Slater's narrative, but the greater 
number of the other famous parliamentary 
names are wanting; their places are taken by 
those of Brougham, Cobbett, Huskisson, Edwin 
Chadwick, who did such efficient work for san- 
itation, and the leaders of the trades union 
movement. 

But on the subjects that fall within the 
author's purpose he writes clearly and fully. 
They are chiefly such topics as parliamentary 
and municipal reform ; the industrial revolution 
and factory legislation ; the labor movement in 
its various phases ; the corn laws and tariff re- 
form ; the poor laws, educational reforms, and 
sanitation ; and other related subjects. Three 
chapters are devoted to conditions in country 
and town in the years immediately following the 
close of the Napoleonic wars; and the picture 
is one of hopeless distress. Six chapters take 
up in detail the earlier reforms in constitution 
and industry ; more than half of the work is 
given to the period prior to the Crimean War. 
The remainder of the volume is devoted chiefly 
to education, municipal activities, and changes 
in the industrial system. 

Dr. Slater has his views on present-day Eng- 
lish problems and movements, and expresses 



1913] 



THE DIAL,

them without fear. On the subject of tariff 
reform he holds very moderate views. He 
seems to be a believer in state support for in- 
dustry, but sees little to be gained from the 
political programme of the Unionists. 

" It is unfortunate that the case between free trade 
and neo-protectionism has had to be argued before a 
public which has been denied any general education in 
economics, and therefore is not well prepared to under- 
stand the sounder arguments on both sides. The 
controversy has, therefore, degenerated, through the 
irresistible temptation offered to both sides to rouse pre- 
judices and to use arguments, however unsound, which 
happen to appeal to the uninstructed voter. . . . There 
is a tendency on both sides to grossly exaggerate the 
net economic gain or loss to the country as a whole of 
a system of free imports on the one side and of small 
import' duties on the other." 

He also fears that, as the political parties are 
rather evenly balanced, " the country may oscil- 
late between the two systems and so suffer greater 
loss and damage than from a continued adher- 
ence to even the worse of the two." 

For imperialistic ambitions, as the term 
is usually understood, he has no sympathy. 
Against the imperial system itself he brings a 
terrible indictment. 

" We are accustomed to think of the British Empire 
as consisting mainly of men of the Anglo-Saxon blood, 
and as being on the whole well governed, highly civilized 
and wealthy. As a matter of fact the Empire consists 
mainly of Asiatics ; it is more cursed by deep poverty 
than any other great state, and the great majority of 
its adult population are unable to read and write." 

The greatest problem is the Indian service. 
England has too few civil servants in India; 
they are poorly trained and they govern accord- 
ing to obsolete ideas "the ghost of the eco- 
nomic doctrine of laissez-faire " clings to actual 
practice. On the matter of training for the 
civil service the author is emphatic : " To vari- 
ous audiences I have urged that the first step 
for the salvation of the Empire must be to 
abolish compulsory Greek at Oxford and Cam- 
bridge and substitute compulsory geography." 
But he hopes that out of imperialism will grow 
internationalism, that the Empire will serve 
as a long step toward the "federation of the 
world." 

With the feminist movement the author is 
in evident sympathy. English women demand 
the ballot because it is a symbol of equality 
and because they "believe in its overwhelming 
importance." 

"The state is equally concerned with men and women; 
its business is no longer the extension of territory, but 
chiefly the securing of a better environment for the 
coming generation; and the exclusion of women from 
a share in that business can be defended only on the 
ground of their intellectual inferiority." 



The modern British industrial system Dr. 
Slater believes to be fundamentally wicked: 
" The whole structure of business of the modern 
type is built upon a foundation of injustice." 
Of the three groups that are interested in a 
public service corporation, the shareholders, 
the laborers, and the public, the first has the 
least personal interest. The capitalist, because 
of his scattered investments, becomes " less and 
less able to discharge the duties and responsi- 
bilities attaching to ownership"; his prudence 
in investing reduces him " to a mere parasite on 
the business which he, with his fellows, owns." 
The author looks for great changes in industrial 
organization ; these may be Socialistic or Syndi- 
calistic, or possibly both forms will appear ; but 
he does not believe that any new form will pre- 
vail to such an extent as to eliminate all the 
earlier types. 

It seems to the reviewer that Dr. Slater has 
been more anxious to interpret his facts than 
to find and state them; that he expresses his 
opinions too freely and too positively ; and that 
consequently his work can scarcely be classed as 
history. But as a summary of the causes that 
have led to the disturbed conditions of the pre- 
sent, written from the viewpoint of one who is 
sympathetic toward the yearnings and strivings 
of the toiling masses, it has an interest and a 
value of its own. But it is an argument rather 
than a historical narrative.

STUDIES OF THE ENGLISH 



Histories of literature continue to multiply. 
If the classics of our tongue were increasingly 
read in proportion as they can be increasingly 
read about, there would be cause for great grati- 
fication. It is to be feared, however, that the 
latter employment is too likely to be a substitute 
for the former, from the elementary schools up 
to women's clubs and the universities. Doubt- 
less this is no reason why we should be inhos- 
pitable to the new guides made for those who 
would read systematically and intelligently. 
But the difficulty of making such a guide both 
a practical manual and a readable history is 
very great; and one frequently lays down the 
book querying whether it is not, after all, a 
graceful tour de force, exhibiting how much 
ground may be covered with the greatest agility,

without laying the writer open to charges of 
omission from his fellow-scholars and reviewers. 

For illustration, take such a sentence as this, 
from one of the two volumes now before us: 
"Passing Thomas Love Peacock, best recol- 
lected, notwithstanding a lyric or so of distinc- 
tion, for his incomparable wit and humor in 
rime, John Hamilton Reynolds, friend and com- 
panion in poetic adventure of Keats, and Lam an 
Blanchard, preacher, jester, and writer of society 
verses, we reach in Hood the most gifted of the 
poets that fall between the early romanticists 
and the great Victorians." Is this not skilful? 
And is it not at the same time suggestive of 
studying a subterranean water-system from an 
aeroplane ? Or this : " It might be difficult to 
find four writers more in contrast as men and 
authors than Macaulay, Praed, Mangan, and 
Barnes ; indeed, only their likeness in years and 
the circumstance that they all began to write 
well before the accession of Queen Victoria 
could justify the treatment of them together." 
Yes, there is one other justification, that the 
writer was obviously in despair as to how to in- 
clude the necessary names in the pending chap- 
ter without frankly descending to the method of 
a text-book, and saying "1, 2, 3, 4." The re- 
sult of such efforts is that the reader versed in 
the subject-matter of the book perceives that its 
author knew his material well, but that its sig- 
nificance is questionable for those not acquainted 
with the field. Such is the conspicuous case with 
the horde of brilliant literary histories turned 
out by Professor Saintsbury: any intelligent 
reader is eager to know what Mr. Saintsbury 
has to say of his favorite book, but one who would 
have the landscape mapped out for him must 
be directed to some guide at once humbler and 
safer. And the fault here is not with the author 
alone, but with the method of these compendia. 

Of late such suspicions as these have given rise 
to a new type of literary history in which each 
mode or kind is treated by itself, and more econ- 
omy and thoroughness are thereby made possi- 
ble. Two series of this sort are now well under 
way, one made in this country, called "The Types 
of English Literature," whose general editor is 
Professor W. A. Neilson ; and its British coun- 
terpart, called " The Channels of English Lit- 
erature," under the direction of Mr. Oliphant 
Smeaton. The volumes treating of the lyric, in 
these two series, are now at hand, and both have 
been committed to writers of proved scholarship 
and assured competence in critical technique. 
That both are at once learned and readable may 
therefore be assumed without danger. It does 



not follow, however, that they escape altogether 
the queries which have been raised regarding 
the task they undertake to accomplish. If such 
a treatise can give us a real history of the form 
in question, discerning its evolution, its modify- 
ing environment, its quasi-organic life, then the 
type-history justifies itself in a special way. 
This is characteristically possible in a form like 
tragedy or novel, for there one may predicate a 
certain consciousness of type on the part of the 
authors concerned, as well as a fairly obvious 
series of vital influences. But the lyric is a 
form essentially unconscious and essentially 
individualistic; there is, therefore, less signifi- 
cance in treating its history among a given peo- 
ple than in the case of almost any other type. 
Try as we will, then, the task becomes in some 
measure the mere picking up of one name and 
the setting of it down to take up another. 

Mr. Rhys and Professor Schelling have miti- 
gated this tendency in quite different ways. 
The former has felt free to please himself by 
expanding his treatment of that period which 
at once evidently interests him most and is most 
susceptible of scientific and historical treat- 
ment, the mediaeval. Here the evolution of 
the type is handled with more care, and more 
richness of illustration, than can easily be found 
elsewhere, and the result should prove very 
stimulating to any who can read Middle Eng- 
lish without difficulty. Professor Schelling, 
on the other hand, has consulted the interests 
of the general reader, which are sure to be dis- 
proportionately concerned with recent litera- 
ture, and gives nearly half his book to the 
English lyrists from 1798 to the present, the 
period where individuality is most marked, and 
the historical method least available.* But he 
takes care to meet the needs of the real student 
of the subject by providing at every point hints 
concerning the deeper matters to which indi- 
vidual poets are related, as well as bibliograph- 
ical references in an abundance just not too 
great to be practicable. 

On a subject so doubtfully defined as the 
lyric, one compares with interest the limits 
which the two critics seek to set for their 

* In this matter of proportion, then, neither book appears 
so much to advantage, despite their greater charm of style, 
as Professor Edward B. Reed's " English Lyrical Poetry," 
reviewed in THE DIAL for September 1, 1012. Those seri- 
ously interested in the subject will perhaps find convenient a 
definite, not to say mechanical, comparison of the three books 
so recently published on the same subject. Reed's book, then, 
contains some 174,000 words, Rhys's some 148,000, and Schel- 
lings's some 87,000. To the mediseval lyric Reed devotes 
about 14% of his space, Rhys 23%, and Schelling 6% ; to the 
lyric of the 19th century Reed gives 21%, Rhys 10%, and 
Schelling 38%.

territory. With Rhys it is primarily the rhyth- 
mical or musical element, the primitive spon- 
taneous impulse to song, to which the defining 
lines are always referred. "Lyrical," he tells 
us at the outset, "implies a form of musical 
utterance in words governed by overmastering 
emotion and set free by a powerfully concordant 
rhythm." This leads him to find his subject- 
matter, on occasion, even in narrative poetry, 
as when he cites Chaucer's "lyric remark" 
about the Squire: "He sleep no more than 
doth a nightingale," adding, "One may think 
that not a lyric line at all, but in fact it is an 
enhancing of sound and sense alike by the poet's 
conscious and tuneful exuberance of pleas- 
ure in the fact he is communicating, and there 
lies the essence of the lyric principle." So of 
the " Comus " songs : you feel " the voice-chords 
strong in them ; . . . there is an actual present 
music of the sounds apart from the syllabic and 
intelligible pattern of the words." This is 
admirably suggestive in both thought and 
phrasing. Elsewhere Mr. Rhys recognizes the 
development of the more literary element, which 
came in, for example, with Surrey, "the 
silent lyric which is written and meant to be 
read to oneself"; while with Wordsworth, he 
says, "the converting of the lyrical to the sub- 
lyrical, the verse of sung melody and pure 
vocal rhythm to that of reflective and medita- 
tive expression, was complete."* One can see 
that with this tendency he is more or less impa- 
tient. He is suspicious of the sonnet, for 
example; and, though he admits that Shake- 
speare makes us forget that it is "a book-song, 
a lyric in a cabinet," he gives only a page to 
the Shakespearean collection. Professor Schel- 
ling is more catholic in temper, less interested 
in rhythm, and disposed to emphasize, as mod- 
ern literature inevitably emphasizes, the test of 
subjectivity rather than songfulness. 

Both writers, as we have said, are possessed 
of a skilled and liberal critical style, and pro- 
vide us with obiter dicta which are not the 
least valuable products of this handbook fashion. 
Here are some of the best of Mr. Rhys's : 

" Chaucer was the most delicately syllabic verseman 
who ever wrote in English, so that, reading him after 
the later poets whose fashion is more like our own, we 
are impressed as by the clear but unusual enunciation 
of a child." 

" Sidney's poetry floats on that full stream of history 

* Compare Wordsworth's own words concerning his 
poems : " Some of these pieces are essentially lyrical, and 
therefore cannot have their due force without a supposed 
musical accompaniment ; but, in much the greatest part, I 
require nothing more than an animated or impassioned reci- 
tation." 



[which characterized the Elizabethan court] like leaves 
on a broad river, whose water keeps them fresh." 

The mode of perceptivity which Dryden and his 
school cultivated ties the imagination to the fence, and 
no matter how the wind blows, the range is determined 
by the rope." 

" The tough Saxon fibre remained, ... to give it 
something of that occasional stiffness of English poetry, 
which is apt to affect her verse-writers when they are 
not inspired, . . . and at the same time to give it that 
grip on the earth, which we found first in Widsith and 
Csedmon." 

And here is a hand-cull from Professor Schel- 
ling (whose book is characterized, however, not 
so much by salient passages as by the ample 
knowledge, catholicity, and gentle humor which 
underlie nearly all his judgments) : 

" Elizabethan poetry revels in the art of song, in 
variety and experiment in verse, in the artifices of style ; 
it plays upon words and elaborates ingenious figures of 
speech; it bubbles with voluble joy, or, if cast down, its 
despair or petulance are those of childhood." 

" It is not so much the possession of new or startling 
qualities that characterizes the artistic endowment of 
Shakespeare as it is the superlative degree in which he 
is endowed with qualities which are ordinarily associated 
with the sanity of talent as contrasted with the abnor- 
mality of genius." 

" Keats is the antithesis poetically of Wordsworth, 
in place of whose artistic thrift he practised a splendid 
liberality, in place of whose scrutinizing search for the 
hidden meaning of things he was content to blazon in a 
gorgeous heraldry of his own their outward glories." 

In connection with Professor Schelling's book, 
two or three queries suggest themselves, if only 
for the sake of varying the monotony of agree- 
ment which must, in general, meet the author's 
dicta. For Shakespeare's sonnets he contents 
himself with the easy traditional statement that 
they " are made up of two series," the first 
addressed to a youth, the second to a dark lady ; 
this, despite the fact that the statement has 
never been undisputed, and that recent criticism 
has tended to react against it. Of Donne we are 
told that he is free " from the slightest interest 
in nature or in similitudes drawn from nature," 
a saying which gives us pause when we remember 
the lines 

" A pregnant bank swelled up to rest 
The violet's reclining head," 

the wonderful "Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's 
Day," and the metaphysical toying with the 
five-petaled blossom in "The Primrose." And 
is it not at least questionable to group Matthew 
Arnold with the poets who are more intent on 
form than on "the thing said"? 

A final comparison of the two volumes should 
revert to the humble matter of their practical 
service to the serious reader, and here the admi- 
rable bibliographical apparatus furnished by

Professor Schelling, as already noted, must 
have weight. The index to his manual, too, is 
worthy of more than the reviewer's usual part- 
ing word. By searching here, not merely for 
the names and titles with which the professional 
index-maker contents himself, but for such 
captions as "Celtic Revival," "Classical influ- 
ences," "Conceit," "French influences," "Mad- 
rigal," "Oxford Movement," " Petrarchism," 
"Pre-Raphaelite," and the like, one may read- 
ily be enabled to follow out threads of topical 
importance which are not conspicuous in the 
main pattern of the book. In these respects 
Mr. Rhys's volume is conspicuously inferior. 
There are no accurate references ; bibliography 
is provided in neither notes nor appendix ; and 
the index is only of proper names. The proof- 
reading is also left with much to be desired ; one 
may note particularly the illiterate spelling 
" Sampson " twice on page 228, and what can 
hardly be laid to the printer's door an unpar- 
donable garbling of Browning's lines on Shake- 
speare's sonnets, page 338. 

In view of the present progress of these 
undertakings in literary history, a concluding 
suggestion may not be untimely. We now 
have plenty of histories of English literature as 
a whole, and are coming to have plenty of such 
histories by types. The next step needed is to 
give the student who wishes to gain the view- 
point of what is awkwardly called " comparative 
literature " a view of the types without regard 
to national boundaries. It is desirable to get 
either a complete longitudinal section or a com- 
plete cross-section, to see either the evolution 
of our literature as a whole, or that of one form 
of literature in the modern western world. Some 
of the volumes in Professor Neilson's series will 
perhaps approach this desideratum, at least if 
one may judge from the announcements already 
made; "the short story, mediaeval and mod- 
ern," one would think, can scarcely be confined 
within the boundaries of England, nor can 
one easily fancy Professor Irving Babbitt writ- 
ing a history of English criticism alone. But 
the value of Professor Thorndike's volume on 
tragedy, already issued and proved helpful, is 
impaired by the fact that to treat English 
tragedy by itself, especially in certain periods, 
is almost to throw away the possibility of under- 
standing it. In, the lyric this is not so true. 
But eventually, when the training of our literary 
scholars has become more liberal without losing 
its soundness, we shall have a series dealing 
with the Novel, the Tragedy, the Lyric, and the 
rest, of modern Europe. Till then, students 



exploring these subjects in existing works will 
continue to feel like visitors to a public build- 
ing who find many alluring doors and galleries 
marked " Closed to the public for the present."

THE MAX.* 



"When half-gods go," says Emerson, "the 
gods arrive." Perhaps no more than other 
peoples, but certainly to a marked degree, we 
Americans tend to make our national heroes 
something more than merely human, some- 
thing more, indeed, than demi-gods. In the 
process of ascribing to them characteristics suit- 
able to their eminence, we strip them of their 
humanity, until we find them lifted beyond our 
sympathies into monsters of perfection, crea- 
tures much "too bright and good for human 
nature's daily food." 

As a consequent reaction, books are being 
written, like Mr. Owen Wister's "The Seven 
Ages of Washington," for the purpose of 
proving that the great Virginian, too, was hu- 
man ; and his case seems to require proof that 
he could laugh upon occasion with any of us, 
quite as much as that he could suffer. In the 
latter contingency, we certainly lose the lesson 
that human sufferings can be nobly borne, as 
with Washington, seemingly setting him on a 
pedestal so remote that we can see neither his 
smiles nor his tears. The best compliment ever 
paid an actor is that recently accorded Sir John- 
ston Forbes-Robertson by a young girl who 
said of his Hamlet, "I never before thought 
it could happen." And many an American, it 
is to be feared, has dismissed the Father of his 
Country with the half -formed reflection that 
such a man never really happened. Abraham 
Lincoln is rapidly being accorded a similar 
elevation beyond our daily humanity ; and the 
process can only be stopped, if it can be stopped 
at all, by such a book as the late Francis Fisher 
Browne's "Everyday Life of Lincoln," now 
rewritten to include everything worthy that has 
been brought to light since its first appearance 
twenty-seven years ago. 

If ever there was a thoroughly human man, 
it was the great Liberator. If ever an Ameri- 
can lived from whom his countrymen could 
derive comfort, not only for success but for 
failure, it was he. If any man in any age was 
wrought by the hand of destiny from common

clay into true nobility and imperishable har- 
mony, it was this same Lincoln. And if, in 
spite of all things, whether of good or ill repute, 
a great man ever remained a simple, sane, sweet, 
comprehensible human being, again it was 
Abraham Lincoln. Nothing is to be gained by 
trimming his words and deeds to fit the exi- 
gencies of a later and, it may be, a better age. 
In fact, he was so emphatically of his own time, 
its best, most typical, and most characteristic 
product, that all attempts to harmonize his life 
with another environment must end disastrously. 
No descriptive phrase accorded him has met with 
more general approval than Lowell's " the first 
American "; nothing is to be gained, but much 
lost, by seeking to make him also the last 
American. 

And Francis Fisher Browne, a man of Lin- 
coln's type if ever there was one, has brought 
together out of his great understanding and 
sympathy a mass of opinion, incident, anecdote 
from the most varied sources, fused them into a 
single whole, and left us a vivid portrait which 
shows Lincoln the Man the man who was 
always himself. Some concession has been made 
to the spirit which would make him the man 
who was better than himself, but not much, and 
that only in the words of others ; in the eloquent 
links which bind together the statements and 
sentiments of others, the feeling of the biogra- 
pher is clear : Lincoln was a man like ourselves, 
humbler, commoner, less "gentlemanlike" than 
any of us dare think ourselves, moulded by 
tremendous stress and strain into a figure unique 
in the annals of the world. Like Washington, 
he is one of Plutarch's men, but springing from 
the boundless prairie rather than from the closer 
vicinage of a classical age, a Boeotian who 
loved beauty, a Spartan who could shed tears, 
a Roman who read entirely new meanings into 
the phrase, Imperium et libertas. 

The plan of the book is simple. If anything 
dealing with Lincoln's life from its inhospitable 
beginning to its august close is fully authenti- 
cated and bears the mark of truth, it has been 
deemed worthy of inclusion. "Many of the 
stories told of Lincoln at the bar," we read on 
page 139, " are extremely ridiculous, and repre- 
sent him in anything but a dignified light. 
But they are a part of the character of the man, 
and should be given wherever there is reason 
to suppose they are genuine." Thereupon one 
prime reason for the book's excellence discloses 
itself : " Besides, they are usually full of a humor 
that is irresistible." And what follows is a 
warning to all solemn asses who would have it 



otherwise; for if there was anything human 
that Lincoln's heart did not warm to it was the 
solemn ass. 

It is not with history that this book is chiefly 
concerned, it is with the man in history. 
Only such chronicle of the events that marked 
so portentous an epoch in the world's long life 
has been included as is needful for an under- 
standing of the individual who did so much to 
sway these events and bend them to his will. 
These are dealt with in a spirit that it is no 
exaggeration to call truly Lincolnian. Nearly 
all previous historians and biographers in this 
field, still moved, it would seem, by the bitter- 
ness of that age, have been partisans. Notably 
has this been the case in dealing with the 
relations between Lincoln and McClellan ; the 
mere mention of the two names has seemed to 
call forth the challenge in "King Henry IV.," 
" Under which king, Bezonian ? speak, or die ! " 
But here we find portrayed two men, equally 
zealous, equally anxious, each in possession of 
knowledge he would impart to the other, each 
doomed by his own limitations to imperfect 
understanding of the situation ; yet, in spite of 
all these things, good friends to the end, and 
upon the whole freer from acrimony than any 
of their followers. 

For it is no part of this book's purpose to 
make men and events out better than they 
were and are, nor yet to make them worse. 
Lincoln's own breadth of view and insight into 
human nature are shown to be in full control 
throughout. One can love Lincoln without 
hating McClellan, or admire the general's man- 
ifest good qualities without dishonoring the 
memory of his commander-in-chief. An equal 
catholicity of treatment is accorded such mooted 
questions as Lincoln's religion ; he is shown in 
his everyday life to have been truly religious, 
and the lesser question of creed is left to take 
care of itself. Here and again something is 
said about his abstemiousness regarding liquor ; 
it is made evident that he was one of the most 
temperate of men at a time when temperance 
was rather less valued than at present, and 
that, surely, is all that need be proved. 

But such a book speaks more favorably for 
itself than any reviewer, however sympathetic, 
can possibly speak for it. As it stands, it is a 
monument of patient labor, almost as conspic- 
uous for what it rejects as for what it includes, 
for it is evident that everything has been duly 
weighed. Matters made public as recently as 
February last find due place in its pages ; noth- 
ing has been neglected that adds to a rounded

conception of a great man. The book will stand 
as an impressive memorial both to its subject 
and to its biographer. 

In its external aspects the volume is dignified 
and comely. An analytical index, probably the 
fullest and most serviceable ever included in a 
Lincoln biography, will be welcomed by every 
reader and will give the work a unique refer- 
ence value in the library. Two portraits of 
Lincoln, one a strikingly characteristic study 
by Mr. J. N. Marble never before reproduced, 
together with a portrait of the author, are

GERMANY'S DREAMS OF EXPANSION.* 

"The vital factor in the modern interna- 
tional situation," asserts Professor Usher in his 
recently published treatise on Pan-Germanism, 
" is the aggression of Germany, her determina- 
tion to expand her territories, to increase her 
wealth and power." The general fact is one 
with which the world is familiar, one which, 
indeed, the world is given little opportunity to 
forget. The full and final import of it, how- 
ever, is considered in some quarters to be such 
as few men even dream. In his description of 
the Pan-German movement, Professor Usher 
has sought both to lay bare the hidden forces 
of German aggrandizement, thus seriously con- 
ceived, and to forecast the consequences of it for 
the principal nations of Europe, for our own 
country, and for the world at large. 

The basal factors in the existing situation 
are assumed to be so obvious and so familiar as 
to call for little more than mention : the amazing 
rapidity of the growth of Germany as a national 
power, the phenomenal rate of increase of the 
Empire's population, the multiplication of in- 
dustries and the ever-growing pressure for mar- 
kets, the rapidly diminishing area of the lands 
remaining to be brought under profitable culti- 
vation. The logic of cold facts, it is declared, 
points, and can point only, to expansion. 

" To ask a German whether the expansion of Germany 
is desirable is merely to ask him whether he believes it 
desirable from any point of view for the German nation 
to survive. Of course there can be but one reply. Ex- 
pansion in Europe, however, can take place only at the 
expense of other and independent states, either the pow- 
erful rivals, France and Russia, or the weaker neighbors, 
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden; and even if such 
acquisitions were to be made the difficulty would not be 
solved, for the real problem is to find territory suitable 
for German exploitation and settlement which is not

already heavily populated, at least not populated with 
men and women of an advanced type of civilization. The 
conclusion is that Germany must seek added dominion, 
not alone in Europe, but in the temperate and produc- 
tive portions of the outlying world; and not merely on 
land, but on the sea, to the end that she may command 
highroads to and from her possessions which shall be 
safe from the attacks of her enemies." 

These are the considerations upon which the 
Pan-Germans base their propaganda. The 
essentials of their programme are set forth by 
the writer as follows : 

" The Germans consider perfectly feasible the con- 
struction of a great confederation of states including 
Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Balkan States, and 
Turkey, which would control a great band of territory 
stretching southeast from the North Sea to the Persian 
Gulf. A railway from Constantinople to Baghdad 
would effectually tie the great trunk lines, leading 
from the Rhine and Danube valleys, to Constanti- 
nople and the Persian Gulf, and so establish a shorter 
route to India than that via Suez. Egypt, Syria, 
Arabia, Persia, India herself, the mother of nations, 
would fall into German hands and be held safe from 
conquest by this magnificent overland route to the 
East. Pan-Germanism is, therefore, in the first place, 
a defensive movement for self-preservation, for escap- 
ing the pressure of France and Russia, both bent on 
her destruction. It is, in the second place, an offensive 
movement directed against England, its object, the 
conquest of the English possessions in the Mediterranean 
and in Asia. She expects thus to obtain an outlet for 
her surplus population and manufactures and to create 
an empire as little vulnerable politically, economically, 
or strategically as any the world has yet seen." 

In so far as these purposes are known, they 
are denounped by other nations as involving a 
return to the methods of sheer force long ago 
outgrown, presumably, by the civilized world. 
The Germans, however, we are told, "derisively 
point to the presence of the English in India, 
of the French in Morocco, of the Russians in 
Manchuria, of the United States in Panama," 
and insist that their own aims and methods 
are " absolutely identical with those their de- 
tractors have so long employed." The question 
that arises perhaps most insistently in the 
reader's mind is, In how far is the programme 
thus outlined concurred in by, or even known 
to, the mass of the German people ? In other 
words, Is Pan-Germanism essentially national 
in its constituency and spirit? Upon this point 
we are given no very definite information. Per- 
haps the obscurities surrounding the subject 
are so impenetrable that definite information 
cannot be had. "The extent to which the 
German nation as a whole," we are told, "is 
conscious of the existence of Pan-Germanism is 
not demonstrable. There can be no doubt that 
the Government has consistently attempted to 
shape public opinion in favor of it." That 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



411 



Germans of all parties and sects appreciate the 
seriousness of the economic problem by which 
the country is confronted cannot be gainsaid; 
nor, indeed, that the impulse which constitutes 
the driving force of Pan-Germanism is present, 
and is realized in some measure, in other coun- 
tries even as in Germany. And in Germany at 
least, the tendency of government influence, of 
education, and of literature is distinctly to 
accentuate the high mission and the unlimited 
possibilities of the nation. Whatever the pres- 
ent situation, the Pan-German ideal appears 
not unlikely, as time goes on, to be stamped 
more indelibly than ever upon the national 
consciousness. 

In the judgment of Professor Usher, the pros- 
pect of the realization of the ideal is dubious. 
After due allowance has been made for the many 
elements of strength in the programme, the final 
impression seems rather to be one of essential 
weakness and uncertainty. The strongest evi- 
dence to be had at present of the feasibility of 
the Pan-German idea is affirmed to be the 
sheer fact that "the statesmen and diplomats of 
Europe, who know more about the situation than 
historians ever will, believe that its success is 
probable," and have so believed " for more' than 
a generation "; and, furthermore, the fact that 
in the autumn of 1912 circumstances so shaped 
themselves that the Pan-German confederation 
was apparently within measurable distance of 
completion. After all, however, this is incon- 
clusive. And over against these considerations 
must be set the extreme difficulty of creating 
any such confederation as that which the Pan- 
Germans expect to bring into existence for the 
furthering of their plans. It is the belief of 
the author that the subversion of the naval and 
commercial power of Great Britain might more 
readily be accomplished than the proposed recon- 
struction of the continent ; yet this is the second, 
rather than the first, point in the present pro- 
gramme. " Pan-Germanism," it is asserted, " is 
weakest at its centre. Its success is least prob- 
able at home. Withoufthe cooperation of Aus- 
tria and Italy, the scheme is impossible"; and it 
is easy to show, not only that scarcely two gen- 
erations ago the relations of the present members 
of the Triplice were fundamentally hostile, but 
that the spirit of distrust and jealousy among 
them is still such as to threaten any great pro- 
gramme of political reconstruction involving 
their cooperation. The instability of the racial 
situation, the growth of socialism, and the tradi- 
tional effectiveness of English diplomacy and 
naval power are cited as additional obstacles of 



large import. Altogether, the programme seems 
too ambitious to be possible of more than very 
partial realization. But undoubtedly it will 
continue to supply a key to much that is vital 
in world politics and diplomacy.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The imperial William Scott Ferguson, 

development of whose work on " Hellenistic Athens " 
ancient Greece. was rev iewed in THE DIAL last year, 
holds the chair of Ancient History at Harvard Uni- 
versity ; and has apparently been devoting especial 
attention to the field of Hellenistic Greece. As a 
companion volume to the above-mentioned book, he 
has just issued a work entitled " Greek Imperialism " 
(Houghton Mifflin Co.), containing seven lectures 
delivered at the Lowell Institute, Boston, in Febru- 
ary of this year. In the earlier chapters the main 
lines of imperial development in Greece are traced. 
In the others, Mr. Ferguson discusses the imperial 
growths in the Greek city-states as illustrated in the 
empires of Athens, Sparta, Alexander, the Ptolemies, 
Seleucids, and Antigonids. Claiming continuity of 
constitutional development within the whole period, 
he insists that while the city-state reached its greatest 
efficiency in the time of Pericles, yet the federation 
was still being perfected two hundred years later. 
To which he adds the dictum : " In government, as 
in science, the classic age was but the youthful bloom 
of Greece, whereas its vigorous maturity in which 
it was cut down by Rome came in the Macedonian 
time." This is calculated to open the eyes of the 
intelligent reader who has been accustomed to think 
of the Hellenistic Age as a period of decline. The 
author's brief and original statement of his thesis is 
this: 

"The city-states of Greece were uni- cellular organisms 
with remarkable insides, and they were incapable of growth 
except by subdivision. They might reproduce their kind 
indefinitely, but the cells, new and old, could not combine to 
form a strong nation. Thus it happened that after Athens 
and Sparta had tried in vain to convert their hegemonies 
over Greece into empires, a cancerous condition arose in 
Hellas, for which the proper remedy was not to change the 
internal constitutions of city-states, as Plato and Aristotle 
taught, but to change the texture of their cell walls so as to 
enable them to adhere firmly to one another. With a con- 
servatism thoroughly in harmony with the later character of 
the Greek people, the Greeks struggled against this inevit- 
able and salutary change. But in the end they had to yield ; 
saving, however, what they could of their urban separate- 
ness, while creating quasi-territorial states by the use of the 
federal 'system and deification of rulers." 

It must be admitted that the scientific working out 
of this theory will be followed with less interest than 
the detached and vigorous narratives which form its 
several supports. The explanation of the Athenian 
kelicea (popular jury-courts) and ecclesia (popular 
assembly) is not very clear at first reading; while 
the description of the Senate of five hundred and its 
constituent prytanes a somewhat perplexing ar- 



412 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 



rangement is perfectly lucid; and Mr. Ferguson's 
characterization of the Athenians as a " nation of 
noblemen" and of their ecclesia as "high-class am- 
ateurs" is both striking and just. The curious and 
impressive contrast between Athens and Sparta is 
emphasized, and the little-appreciated fact brought 
out that Spartan institutions as we generally regard 
them succeeded a many-sided and progressive cul- 
ture, which was crushed out, to the end that her citi- 
zens might become trained soldiers having but one 
spirit, the esprit de corps of a professional army. A 
warning to some modern educators is contained in 
this remark of Mr. Ferguson's : "The singleness of 
purpose with which Sparta made vocational training 
the aim of her public education achieved the happy 
result that she had no men of letters to betray to 
posterity damaging secrets of state." The way in 
which the world-empire of Alexander the Great 
broke up at his death and threw off nebulous frag- 
ments each destined to become a powerful kingdom 
is graphically described by Mr. Ferguson in the 
chapters devoted to the empires of the Ptolemies, 
Seleucids, and Antigonids ; and there is a brief but 
weighty concluding section tracing the fluctuations 
and transfers of power among the various leagues 
Achaean, Hellenic, and others with Macedon as 
the interfering and controlling factor, down to the 
time when the real world-conqueror stepped in, 
wrested from Macedon its chances, and began those 
attacks on Hellenic independence which culminated 
at Corinth in 146 B. c. The book is well printed, is 
provided with an index, and has a select bibliography 
after each chapter. On page 42 "pitch" is prob- 
ably intended for pith "; Chronus " (p. 143) should 
be "Kronos" or "Cronus." 

Some time ago we had the pleasure 
of reviewing a book called Survival 
and Reproduction" by Mr. Herman 
Reinheimer. This consisted of a vigorous plea, 
intended to be at once scientific and transcendental, 
in behalf of vegetarianism. The plea must have 
failed, in some degree at least, because the same au- 
thor now comes forward with another work, "Evo- 
lution by Cooperation: A Study in Bio-Economics" 
(Button), which in essentials is as like the former 
as two peas from the very same pod. The thinking 
here is just as muddy, and the diction just as tur- 
gidly technical, as ever. And best of all, "Bio- 
Economics " turns out to be our old friend vegetar- 
ianism in a new disguise. Now a vegetarian diet 
is undoubtedly a good thing for those who like that 
sort of thing. But to attempt to make it the basis 
of all evolution, philosophy, ethics, and the problems 
of sex is going a bit too far. It is open to question 
whether the method of injunction should not be 
brought to bear to restrain Mr. Reinheimer from 
correlating all things cosmic with cabbages, which 
he seems in a fair way to do unless somehow held 
in check. The present volume contains one novelty 
in the form of a most enticing mystery. At various 
places in the book, cryptic references are made to 



" Love- Foods." Nowhere are we told precisely what 
these delectable morsels are. One wonders. Is a 
" love-food " a new sort of super-heated, steam-rolled, 
fine-combed breakfast cereal, or is it a Burbank 
creation perchance a new variety of cucumber, or 
finally is it a new Eustace Miles entree? To pon- 
der the problem is only to become the more baffled. 
Mr. Reinheimer has a weakness for quotations as 
chapter headings. The range of authors so quoted 
extends all the way from King Solomon to Henry 
Drummond. For utter irrelevancy they are only to 
be surpassed by the concatenation of ideas in the 
text itself. There are six classic lines, however, 
whicli ought to stand at the beginning of the first 
chapter of each of Mr. Reinheimer's books. They fit 
the case more aptly than anything else which could 
be found in the whole realm of literature. They are : 

" ' The time has come,' the Walrus said, 

' To talk of many things : 
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax 

Of cabbages and kings 
And why the sea is boiling hot 

And whether pigs have wings.' " 

An argument Mr. Edward S. Corwin's volume 

for national , ., j ,, -vr , i c> 

supremacy in entitled " .National Supremacy : 
treaty -making. Treaty Power vs. State Power " 
(Holt) is a study of relations between the federal 
treaty power and the state police power. The 
author's thesis is that the treaty power is practi- 
cally unrestricted by constitutional limitations, the 
sole checks to its abuse being of a political nature. 
After disposing of all constitutional limitations on 
the treaty power, he undertakes to show that the 
federal treaty power is unrestricted by any state 
powers. Under the Articles of Confederation the 
treaty power was regarded as supreme. Paragraph 
2 of Article vi. of the Constitution clearly indicates 
national supremacy in this regard, and the courts 
early adhered to this view. Though a different 
attitude was evolved in certain judicial dicta in the 
period of "states rights" agitation before the Civil 
War, the original precedents have never been over- 
ruled. By the theory of the federal Constitution, 
there are no "reserved" state powers which the 
federal government may not encroach upon if it 
does so in the pursuance of a constitutional power 
or a power "necessary and proper" for carrying 
into effect some specified constitutional authority. 
Present-day constitutional jurisprudence upholds 
national supremacy, as also does the vast prepon- 
derance of learned opinion on the subject ; in proof 
of which the author cites Kent, Story, Calhoun, 
Gushing, and Willoughby. In concluding, Mr. 
Corwin summarizes his reasons for believing the 
treaty power to be supreme over state authority. 
He also points out several reasons why no vital 
dangers to the rights of the states need be appre- 
hended from this view. The political check offered 
by the Senate and frequently also by the House of 
Representatives, together with the consideration 
that national policy and state interests are in most 
cases identical, he thinks will always be sufficient 



1913]

to prevent any abuse of the treaty-making power. 
The whole question is treated solely from a consti- 
tutional standpoint; and while the author intimates 
that political expediency will always be an impor- 
tant factor in the execution of treaties, this phase 
of the matter is not dwelt upon. The main theme 
of the work has to do with the treaty-making 
power, but the general question of federal suprem- 
acy in other fields is also discussed. The book is 
a careful and scholarly piece of work, and its argu- 
ment for national supremacy in the field of treaty- 
making seems to be irrefutable from a constitutional 
standpoint. __________ 

The short ttorv Four recent works on the short story 
at literature and illustrate the different ways in which 
a* merchandise. this form of literature is viewed. 
Professor Henry S. Canby's " Study of the Short 
Story " (Holt), though intended for college classes 
and general readers, presents the results of scholarly 
investigations that have already won the respect even 
of those who differ most radically from the author's 
conclusions. The first seventy-five pages of the book 
trace the development of the short story in English, 
from mediaeval times to the present. The remaining 
two hundred pages are occupied by eleven selected 
illustrative tales. Like all collections, this latter 
part will call forth individual question and protest. 
Why, for instance, is the work of Kipling, or even 
the uncopyrighted work of Kipling, represented by 
"On Greenhow Hill"? The preliminary essay is 
concise and interestingly written ; and the fact that 
the author refers for evidence and fuller discussion 
to his earlier book, " The Short Story in English," 
defends him from the charge of being dogmatic on 
mooted questions. Mr. Nathaniel C. Fowler, Jr., 
begins "The Art of Story- Writing " (Sully & Klein- 
teich) with the assertion that " The writing of 
stories . . . may be considered as a trade "; and 
his book is one of several which appeal to untrained 
persons who wish easy directions as to how to secure 
literary fame and large publisher's checks. The 
remarks on the construction and technique of the 
short story are very general, and many of them very 
trite. The directions regarding the form of MS., 
dealings with publishers, etc., are more explicit, and 
may be safely followed. These instructions regard- 
ing the mechanical matters of authorship may be 
useful to the man who by critical study and practice 
has come to understand the literary form that he 
attempts. Unfortunately, many of the readers of 
Mr. Fowler's manual will never see a book like 
Professor Canby's, and would lack the acquaintance 
with literature to appreciate it if they did. Similar 
in aim to Mr. Fowler's book is " The Art of Short 
Story Writing Simplified," in which Dr. Modeste 
Hannis Jordan of " The Writer's Magazine " gives in 
fifty diminutive pages the whole secret of winning 
editorial approval, including a two-page "list of 
verbs to indicate speech or reply." Mr. Benjamin 
A. Heydriek's "Types of the Short Story" (Scott, 
Foresman & Co.) is a modest little volume intended 



A queen 
of shreds 
and patches. 



primarily for students of secondary schools, but of 
possible value to other readers. It contains thirteen 
stories, the choice of which is perhaps as satisfactory 
as that in most collections, with brief but sensible 
critical comments and good working bibliographies. 

In his volume on " Mme. Tallien : 
Notre Damede Thermidor " (Lane), 
M. Gastine appears less as a biog- 
rapher than as an avenging spirit. He confesses 
that he has been prompted to his severities "by 
thoughts of her guilty participation in the craven 
and criminal deeds of the Revolutionaries." He 
even expresses resentment at the attempts of the 
Chimay family, into which she finally married, to 
suppress the documents bearing upon her early 
adventures. The translator has emphasized this 
attitude by changing the secondary title from "Heine 
du Directoire," which the book bore at its publica- 
tion in Paris four years ago, to "A Queen of Shreds 
and Patches." The single deed to which the Tal- 
liens owed a brief popularity was the part they took 
in the overthrow of Robespierre. According to a 
familiar legend, Mme. Tallien, then the divorced 
wife of the Marquis de Fontenay and a prisoner at 
La Force, sent a letter to Tallien, her lover, accus- 
ing him of cowardice in leaving her to perish, 
accompanying the message by a Spanish dagger 
with which to strike down the " Tyrant." This 
legend M. Gastine seeks to discredit. He declares 
that Tallien could not have been spurred to action 
by love for his mistress " for the simple reason that 
he was incapable of a genuine affection." He also 
argues that the part taken by Tallien in the affair 
of the Ninth of Thermidor was unimportant. It has 
long been known that, while Tallien 's role was 
spectacular, the real engineer of Robespierre's 
destruction was Fouche'. But anyone who reads 
without prejudice the story of the struggle in the 
Convention will not feel that Tallien was the coward 
M. Gastine believes him to have been. M. Gastine 
follows the discussion of this affair by an account 
of Mme. Tallien's adventures during the period of 
the Directory and of the Consulate. He treats 
more summarily the last thirty years of her life, 
after the voice of scandal ceased to be occupied 
witboher, except retrospectively. His rhetorical 
Denunciations of both the Talliens are multiplied 
wearisomely, and details are given which belong 
more appropriately in a chronique scandaleuse. 

The romantic lt would be interesting if one could 
story of learn how the Latin races regard the 

California. earlier English settlements on the 
American continents. Do they, we wonder, find in 
these exploits any of the spirit of high romance that 
de Heredia found in the deeds of the Conquista- 
dores as indicated in that wonderful sonnet about 
them. For it is certain that even those of us who 
trace our American origin back to early Virginia 
and Massachusetts fail to find, even in the records 
of Pocahontas and King Philip, any of the thrill

THE DIAL

that attaches to the early Spanish and French 
adventures in the New World. On this account, the 
most interesting portions of American history are 
not yet firmly fixed in the popular mind ; for the 
southwestern and Pacific Coast commonwealths 
have seldom found historians and poets to do for 
them what has been done for the more northerly 
Atlantic States. All of which is merely preliminary 
to an expression of satisfaction that in "The Story 
of California" (McClurg), Mr. Henry K. Norton 
should have incorporated so much of the charm of 
the beginnings. The aboriginal inhabitants were 
devoid of charm; and there is a distinct loss of 
interest when the gold-seekers of 1849, Argonauts 
though they were called, arrive to destroy the older 
charm of the missions and the great estates of the 
Spanish. But this is only the romantic view ; there 
was an abundance of event in California's history, 
and life in the state has not yet become dull. Mr. 
Norton is fortunate in holding little or no prejudice 
to distort his pages. Even so quarrel-provoking a 
topic as that of Fremont's asserted conquest is 
treated with a dispassion that makes further quar- 
relling needless. The sub-title of the book notes 
that its story runs "from the earliest days to the 
present," and in fact the ground is covered from 
the days of the Digger Indian to the approaching 
exhibition in honor of the opening of the Panama 
Canal. Nothing of consequence is omitted, and the 
tale is told smoothly and animatedly. The book is 
heartily commended to all who wish to satisfy 
themselves that this nation really borders upon two 
oceans. 

The problem The appearance of the substantial 
of university volume on "University Control" 
control. (Science Press), edited by Professor 

J. McKeen Cattell, the chief contributor, gives op- 
portunity to reinforce the place of this vital move- 
ment in the present educational situation. THE 
DIAL has repeatedly expressed its approval of this 
desire for a professional status on the part of the 
university professor. The present volume makes 
it possible to present the basis of this reform in a 
dignified and impressive manner. It has a special 
message for those authoritatively connected with the 
administration of universities. The volume begins 
with a series of essays by Professor Cattell, indica- 
ting the undesirable status of the professor's present 
position, together with a brief account of its his- 
tory and a programme for reform. This is fol- 
lowed by a series of extracts from two hundred 
letters, in turn selected from a still larger number, 
presenting a variety of views but with an over- 
whelming agreement in favor of an urgent and com- 
prehensive change. The purpose of the reform is to 
give the faculty as a whole and the professor as an 
individual a decisive voice and an influential rep- 
resentation in the direction of university affairs. If 
it succeeds, it may save a career in serious danger 
of further degeneration, and may reinstate the Amer- 
can university on a footing comparable to the uni- 



versities of foreign lands. The third portion of the 
book contains a group of essays upon special phases 
of the problem of university control, contributed 
by ten writers. Eight of these are university pro- 
fessors; one is a man of business who has held a 
position of trustee ; and the last is a university presi- 
dent. It is probable that these individual essays, 
carrying as they do a more direct appeal and a vigor- 
ous personal statement, will create the sympathetic 
atmosphere predisposing to a favorable hearing. 
The collection in a single volume of the data showing 
how universal is the protest against the status quo, a 
definite programme of reform, and a varied expres- 
sion of dissatisfaction, should succeed in giving this 
problem the right of way which its urgency demands. 
It is with more than the usual sense of approval and 
good wishes that this book is welcomed as an instru- 
ment in the cause of higher education.

eyes only. ^o win her own way as one of the 

world's workers, in spite of her tremendous handi- 
cap, have gained her the increased admiration and 
respect of her friends and of the larger public ; and 
in her latest book, " Out of the Dark " (Doubleday), 
she again demonstrates her ability to stand on her 
own merits as a thinker and writer. She follows 
with alertness and understanding the news of the 
great world about her, and writes with conviction 
on such topics of general interest as "The Modern 
Woman," "How to Become a Writer," and "The 
New College Girl," as well as on subjects connected 
with the treatment and education of the blind and 
of the deaf. Bits of autobiography occur in such 
chapters as "How I Became a Socialist," "Christ- 
mas in the Dark," and "An Apology for Going to 
College." In fact, it is the writer's personality that 
gives peculiar interest and meaning to what she 
writes. One likes her modest answer to the blind 
boy asking her how to become a writer: "Alas! I 
do not know how to become one myself. No one can 
be taught to write." But she gives him some good 
advice, good for the seeing as well as for the sight- 
less. Pathetic is her lament, in connection with a 
widespread report of her having become a socialist, 
luat the subject is aired, not because the newspapers 
care anything about socialism, "but because I, alas, 
am a subject for newspaper gossip." The volume 
contains, as the preface announces, "all hitherto 
uncollected magazine articles and addresses which 
seem for any reason worth preserving in book form." 
It supplements in a notable manner "The Story of 
My Life" and "The World I Live In."

title of " The First Principles of Heredity," a series

THE DIAL,

of lectures given to a class of working-men. This 
is now followed by a similar series, dealing with a 
closely related topic, "The First Principles of Evo- 
lution" (Macmillan). The author has endeavored 
to give a simple, comprehensive, and scientific pres- 
entation of the problem of evolution, and the pro- 
gress which has been made towards its solution. It 
is fair to say that he has succeeded very well at 
this by no means easy task. Mr. Herbert writes in 
a clear, straightforward way, and shows excellent 
judgment in the choice and treatment of his mate- 
rial. The discussion of the "higher" aspects of 
evolution is much more adequate, both in amount 
and character, than is ordinarily the case in ele- 
mentary treatises. Special chapters are devoted to 
"Mental Evolution," "Moral Evolution," and "The 
Evolution of Society." Apparently the most pains- 
taking care has been given (as is proper) to the 
verification of quotations and proof-reading. But in 
spite of this punctiliousness, the reader who chanced 
to open the book at page 255 and looked at the run- 
ning head would be in doubt as to whether the chap- 
ter on " Morel Evolution " dealt with mushrooms or 
ethics. But these are crosses which everyone who 
writes must bear. The book as a whole may be rec- 
ommended without qualification as an excellent in- 
troduction to the subject of evolution, both for the 
general reader and for college classes in biology. 

Roman lessons J* is alwa y s . gratifying to find men 
for the in public life who still adhere to 

United states. Macaulay's tenet that history is phi- 
losophy teaching by examples, and believe that the 
wise statesman or economist of the present will con 
with eagerness the lessons of the past. As to the 
particular period of history that offers the most in- 
structive parallels to our own problems, there must 
be some doubt; but many thinkers would agree with 
Senator J. Hamilton Lewis, author of "Two Great 
Republics" (Rand, McNally & Co.), in selecting 
ancient Rome. "The five centuries of republican 
institutions on the banks of the Tiber still remain 
the richest quarry to which the student of republican 
governments is able to resort." In this belief the 
author reviews the course of Roman history to the 
establishment of the Empire, and sets forth the les- 
sons he has been able to read in the period. In the 
more strictly historical portions Senator Lewis does 
not hesitate to traverse the verdict of eminent men, 
like Mommsen, confidently and even pugnaciously, 
as may be seen, for example, in his trenchant treat- 
ment of Julius Caesar; but it would scarcely be 
expected that this should prove the significant fea- 
ture of his work. In fact its essence lies in the 
conclusions formulated in the first chapter and the 
two closing chapters of the book. Herein Senator 
Lewis is suggestive and stimulating, although the 
thoughtful reader will often find himself unable to 
see eye to eye with the author. To the reviewer, 
however, the interest of the volume is neither in the 
historical sketch nor in the conclusions per se, but in 
the fact that Senator Lewis has declared himself so 



forcibly and tangibly in favor of the spirit suggested 
in our opening sentence. If any country at any hour 
ever needed to be reminded that the path toward 
to-morrow cannot best be built by closing our eyes to 
the lessons of the past, surely it is our own country at 
the present hour.

A revised and enlarged edition of its " Handbook of 
the Libraries of the University " is published by the 
University of Chicago, giving a full history and descrip- 
tion of the Harper memorial building and information 
concerning the various book collections housed there and 
elsewhere in the University, with instructions for the 
intelligent use of these resources. A fine view of the 
new building, with plans of its several floors, and with 
other pertinent and interesting matter, will be found in 
the Handbook. 

ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE. 

The doyen of English scientists, Dr. Alfred Russel 
Wallace, died on the 7th of this month, in his ninety- 
first year. In the establishment of the doctrine of 
evolution on a scientific basis, his name will always be 
linked with that of Darwin, as he had independently 
thought out the theory on which Darwin's work is 
based before the latter's results were placed before the 
public ; but in generously yielding the field to his rival 
he gave to the world perhaps the finest of all examples 
of that spirit of personal disinterestedness in which 
science is rich beyond any other field of human endea- 
vor. He was born January 8, 1823, in Monmouthshire, 
and at an early age fitted himself for work as a sur- 
veyor and engineer. Soon, however, a marked bent for 
natural science began to assert itself. In 1848 he 
joined the South American expedition organized by H. 
W. Bates ; and the following fourteen years of his life 
were mainly spent in scientific collecting and research 
work throughout South America and the Malay Archi- 
pelago. In 1886-7 he visited America, travelling from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific. Numerous scientific studies 
of the first importance have appeared from his pen. 
But it was not to science alone that he devoted his fine 
intellectual powers. Always an interested student of 
sociology, he had the keenest of eyes for detecting the 
rotten timbers in our social structure, and was fearless 
in expressing his carefully-reached convictions, however 
radical. The more fundamental tenets of Socialism 
had his endorsement; he was President for a long term 
of years of the Land Nationalization Society, advocat- 
ing constantly those policies with reference to the soil 
which the Liberal government in England is now 
putting into practice. As in the case of Ruskin, his 
heterodoxy brought upon him a liberal measure of 
abuse and ridicule from the hidebound of his own coun- 
try and ours; but, like Ruskin, he never recanted or 
compromised in the face of obloquy. His life has been 
a long and noble service to humanity, performed in a 
spirit of modest self-effacement as rare almost as the 
achievement itself.

expense is CUT in HALF. 

HOLLISTON LIBRARY BUCKRAM 

is designed to give the maximum amount of service. It will 
wear longer than leather and twice as long as the ordinary 
styles of cloth bindings. 

It has been adopted by hundreds of the leading libraries in 
the country as a standard fabric for rebinding. 
In your next order specify HOLLISTON LIBRARY BUCK-

Library Books Come and

Binding Goes on Forever! 

A good way to discover the best binding is to send 
a selection of books, varying widely in qualities of 
paper, to different binders, sending some to 

CHIVERS' BINDERY, Brooklyn, N.Y. 

Then watch their service and discover whose 
bindings allow of the most issues in good condition. 

CHIVERS' BINDINGS have, with more or less 
success, been imitated in several particulars, but by 
no means in all. 

You can have the REAL THING just as low in price 
as the partial imitation, with lasting economies in

OLD HALLOWELL ON THE KENNEBEC 

By EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON 

Author of Old Colonial Houses in Maine, and other works 
Is a new book on the early Colonial and later local history of 
the Kennebec, a book to quote from the Boston Evening 
Transcript " true as history, compelling as romance, ... of 
great interest and value as a contribution to the history of New 
England. From the records of the Plymouth settlers, who estab- 
lished a trading post on the Kennebec in 1627, from the Relations 
of the Jesuits, who had a mission there among the Abenakis, 
from old-time letters and unpublished manuscripts, from early 
newspapers and for the later decades from her own girlhood 
memories, Mrs. Nason has produced in this volume a picture of 
the social and intellectual life of Old Hallowell, notable not only 
for its scholarly accuracy, but also for its rare literary charm. 
The volume is illustrated with sixty-four full-page half-tones 
from photographs of rare portraits, of fine old houses, and of 
the picturesque scenery of Hallowell. It is an octavo of 359 
pages, with broad margins, gilt top, and rich cloth binding. Its 
price is $3.50 ; postage, 24 cents extra.

All the most striking charac-

story are brilliantly pictured, 
but " the end-piece," says 
Mr. Wyeth, "shows the brig 
Covenant passing the head- 
lands of western Scotland 
perhaps in the vicinity of 
' Torren Rocks.' " It was 
with the greatest difficulty I 
found an authentic merchant 
brig of 1750, but finally found 
one in the archives of the 
Essex Museum in Salem, 
Mass." which matter-of-fact 
statement throws a spark of

John Galsworthy 

Acclaimed on AH Sides by Reviewers for this Account 
of "The Love Life of a Man" 



Boston Transcript : 

" That he does know many, many 
phases of man's inmost nature, his 
latest story clearly reveals. It 
discards all the old conventions, it 
upsets some of our most sacred 
moral traditions, it throws aside all 
commonplaces of fiction. But it is 
nevertheless the truth, and it is the 
truth that we want, especially in the 
novel." 

The Pall Mall Gazette : 

" It is not likely that the artistry 
of this novel will anywhere be over- 
praised. It has characteristics ex- 
tremely rare in fiction."

Spragg a Memorable Figure" 

Chicago Record- Herald: 

" The Custom of the Country ' must take its place beside ' The 
House of Mirth ' as representing Mrs. Wharton's art at its best. 
The novel is written with a flashing vivacity of phrase, crisp dialogue, 
and entire naturalness of characterization. All the people are alive, 
but Undine Spragg is memorable ; it would not be surprising, indeed, 
if her name became a synonym for the modern American type of 
Becky Sharp."

Joseph Bucklin 
Bishop's 

Story of the Panama Canal 

The Panama 
Gateway 

Declared the Best and Most 

Interesting Account by the 

Leading Reviews 

Scientific and commercial, rather 
than romantic, is, at the present 
moment, the significance of a 
complete Panama Canal and 
so therefore is that of the best of 
all accounts of its creation, " The 
Panama Gateway," by Joseph 
Bucklin Bishop. Yet the glam- 
our of romance has hung over the 
Isthmus for centuries, and Mr. 
Bishop was by no means uncon- 
scious of it in writing his book: 
those early chapters that de- 
scribe the explorations of the 
Spanish and all the attempts to 
get through or across the con- 
tinent are fascinating.

Admiral Dewey's 

Chapters of Civil War Naval Battles are among the 
Most Exciting in 

The Autobiography of 
George Dewey, Admiral of the Navy 

Fought Under Farragut and Porter 



Admiral Dewey tries to satisfy 
the ordinary citizen's curiosity 
as to how it feels to be under 
fire. He had this experience 
under Farragut, at the battle of 
New Orleans. He says: 

" For a man of twenty-four I 
was having my share of respon- 
sibility. I was also to have my 
baptism of fire. But I had little 
time to consider the psychology 
of an experience which is the 
source of much wonder and spec- 



ulation to the uninitiated. When 
it comes, you are utterly pre- 
occupied with your work; you 
are doing what you have been 
taught is your duty to do as a 
trained unit on a man-of-war. 
Only after the danger is over is 
it time to reflect. The wait be- 
fore action is the period of self- 
consciousness, which ends with 
the coming of the first shot from 
the enemy or the command to 
' Fire ! ' from your own side."

" These volumes assemble

Reid to the discussion of mat- 
ters of public interest. They are 
designed to illustrate both his 
purely intellectual habit and his 
point of view as a citizen. The 
publicist is, in a measure, a man 
of action, exercising an influence 
which, if not always immediately 
obvious, is nevertheless often 
decisive, and Mr. Reid's career 
brought him into very close and 
effective contact with the sub- 
jects here treated."

A Book of Immense Importance

Perhaps the most permanent,

points in this paragraph : 

" It is not doubtful that some 
lessons of extreme importance 
may be drawn from a study of 
our dealings with the nearest of 
our Latin -American neighbors. 
We have not always been for- 
tunate in our conduct toward the 
other nations of this hemisphere, 
and our failures have, as I think, 
been chiefly due to our ignorance. 
We have not fully grasped the 
fundamental truth that our south- 
ern neighbors are of an utterly 
alien race, whose ideals and vir- 
tues and modes of thought and 
expression are so radically dif- 
ferent from ours that we have 
lacked the sympathetic insight 
which comes only with perfect

The Mission of Children's Books 

All children are susceptible to beauty, and find most entertaining 
or most instructive those things in which the various phases of 
beauty are incorporated. The bookmaker's art, perhaps more fully 
than any other, satisfies both this love of the beautiful and the 
desire for knowledge. 

We believe that in the following books parents, librarians, and 
all lovers of children will find beauty and utility combined, and the 
mission of children's books 

FULFILLED 



Dopp, Katharine Elizabeth 

THE STORY OF THE EARLY SEA PEOPLE 

Illustrated with a colored frontispiece and numerous pictures in black and 

white. Cloth, square 12mo. 75 cent* net. 

In The Story of the Early Sea People are embodied the stirring and 
inspiring elements of the old myths and tales of fairy princes, yet it is really a 
chronicle of our prehistoric ancestors based on the most authentic knowledge 
of them obtainable. Vivid incidents show how an inland tribe, forced to the 
seacoast by oncoming foes and the need of a more bountiful food supply, 
gradually become adapted to a seafaring life. By accident, ingenuity, and 
observation, they convert the materials about them to their use, and their final 
conquest of the waters, when once more driven in search of a better home, 
forms the climax of a remarkable and fascinating book. 

Hardy, Mary Earle

Fairyland itself is disclosed in this book of whimsical verse and fanciful 
pictures. After the first glimpse within one hesitates to close the covers for 
fear of crushing the gossamer gowns, and butterfly wings, and dainty flowers 
that riot over the pages. Not only to the true believer but to those not yet in 
sympathy with sprites and things faSry are the verses recommended, for every 
imaginative reader will appreciate the elfish charm with which they tell just 
where and how the fairies live, and how much fun it is to be one.

NEALE'S FOR DECEMBER 

Our Alien Army By General R. K. Evans, U. S. A. 

Relatively few persons know the political status of the man who binds himself to give his life 
if need be to 'the American people. That he is an alien on whom is inflicted the punishment of 
disfranchisement seems beyond belief. Yet, crisply and authoritatively, General Evans, who com- 
mands the Second Brigade, First Division, with Headquarters at Atlanta, and who is perhaps the 
leading authority of the world on infantry fire, tells us that our national army is really denationalized. 
He does more than this, he suggests a practical remedy for the loss of the political rights of our 
soldiers, and offers a proposal that, if carried out, will bring about the restoration of the degraded 
enlisted soldier to useful citizenship. The General bravely thrusts his sword into the cancer that is 
consuming the most vital member of our body politic, the army that protects it. 

Five Great Serials By Five Eminent Authors 

"The Walls of Concarneau," by George K. Baker, author of " Haliefa," is a novel broidered 
on the historic fabric of the struggle of the devoted Bretons to hold Brittany against the French for 
the young Duchess Anne; "Broken Lights," by Mowry Saben, who is among America's foremost 
essayists, is the general title given to this author's most noteworthy essays, which are now being 
published for the first time; "Brilla," by Anna M. Doling, is an irresistible serial, the story of a 
lie, in which the Ozark Mountains form a picturesque background for the figures that move 
through this striking American novel; "Our Jungle Man " is a series of highly important articles 
in which the relations of the white man and the black as they exist throughout the United States 
are discussed with the utmost freedom by prominent members of both the Caucasian and the Negro 
races, among these writers being Professors Thomas Pearce Bailey, Berrian Beverley, and Kelly 
Miller, and Major John R. Lynch; "Into the Sunset," by Edward S. Van Zile, author of "With 
Sword and Crucifix," and other highly successful novels, is a story in which Columbus is the great 
central figure, a story of romance largely concerning two young men and two young girls, who 
are supposed to have accompanied Columbus on his first trip to America. 

Our Opportunity in Latin America By James Drey 

We Americans, so-called, have never seemed to understand why we have no share in the vast 
affluence of South America. The author of this paper passed sufficient time in our twin continent to 
learn how neglected have been our opportunities and how beneficial to Europe are the relations exist- 
ing between that continent and South America. How to establish trade with our Southern neighbor 
that will increase our prosperity is the problem that Mr. Drey has undertaken to solve in this article. 

Regular Departments By Six Distinguished Authors and Editors 

The regular departments of NEALE'S MONTHLY alone are sufficient to make this magazine noteworthy. The 
Stage is a department of brilliant, trenchant, fearless criticism of plays, actors, and dramatists; in Editorial Comments 
all sorts of subjects are treated, now seriously, now lightly, but always vigorously, fearlessly, and independently; 
The Fraternity of the Fields is the eyes and the ears of him who may not be with Nature in aFl her moods; In Motley 
is a department of wit and humor, not mere jokes, but inoffensive pointedness, directed chiefly at persons in the limelight; 
Letters to the Editors are really short articles that are written by the foremost authors and public men of our time. 

ClaSS Legislation By William W. Crehore 

Mr. Crehore's study of the tariff question, " Our Tribute to Protection," that was published in NEALE'S for 
September attracted widespread attention. In the present paper he treats of class distinction by legislation. The way 
in which the Government selects it own beneficiaries is here explained in a masterly way. And he supplies new ideas 
to those seeking a readjustment of the principles on which our Government was founded, without encouraging the 
spread of Socialism, which would seem inevitable if his plan should be made effective. 

My Neighbor and Myself By Major John R. Lynch 

This article of " Our Jungle Man " comes as a revelation to him who holds the idea that the Negro is merely a 
near-animal in his relation to affairs social, educational, religious, and political. Major Lynch is a Negro, who rose 
from a lowly estate to be a Member of Congress, Fourth Auditor of the United States Treasury, and Temporary 
Chairman of the Republican National Convention of 1884. The late Senator Hoar in his book of reminiscences refers 
to Major Lynch as the ablest colored man who served with him in public life. 

Short Fiction By Various Authors 

Short fiction and various timely and interesting articles, besides the features enumerated above, make NEALE'S 
MONTHLY for December noteworthy among American magazines. 

At $3.00 a year, 25 cents a number, NEALE'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature. Every number contains 
more than 100,000 words of text, superbly illustrated, and no number will contain less than 128 pages. In its 
mechanical appointments no magazine in existence is its superior.

are in " Haliefa " properties suggestive of Kipling, 
not that any influence of Kipling is there discernible, 
but for the reason that the story, while old as humanity 
itself, possesses something of the freshness that Kipling 
brought to literature thirty years ago. These prop- 
erties make the story essentially new. Illustrated.

Brilla 



By ANNA M. DOLING. This unique and irresistible 
story, the story of a lie, was first published seri- 
ally in NEALE'S MONTHLY. A region yet unexplored 
in literature, the Ozark Mountains, forms a picturesque 
background for the figures that move through this 
striking American novel. Seldom is it the good for- 
tune of a reader to find so interesting a story written 
so simply and so well, yet so compellingly. Already 
the sale of this story is large. $1.25 net; $1.35

The Devil's Discharge 

By WILLARI> FRENCH. While the ghosts of the past 
are evaporating in their own mist science is giving 
birth to others by far more weird. In this story 
Colonel French discharges the Devil and his spirits; 
but he is a trained scientist as well as a trained soldier, 
a great writer of fiction as well as a great war corre- 
spondent. In the place of Satan and his imps he 
gives us new but real spirits, all made real by science. 
A story of adventure, a story of love, " The Devil's 
Discharge " also possesses the mysticism of the East. 
Early in his career Colonel French, whose literary 
work is now the talk wherever books are discussed, 
achieved distinction as a war correspondent in Egypt, 
India, and in South Africa. $1.00 net; $1.10 by mail. 



The Scuttlers 

By CLYDE C. WESTOVER. In the group of young 
Californian authors that have so greatly enriched 
American literature during the past ten years Mr. 
Westover is conspicuous as the writer of brilliant, 
virile fiction. Last autumn " The Dragon's Daughter " 
was issued by our house. It immediately attracted 
widespread attention in Europe as well as in America. 
This fine story of the sea, a detective story, is un- 
doubtedly the most notable fiction that Mr. Westover 
has written. We know of no other sea story that is 
comparable to it. It is romantic literature at its best.

HURRYING FATE AND GERALDINE By Florence Morse Klngsley 

The heroine's heart pulsates through the pages of the book. Her nature breathes forth an 
incense made of the distilled aroma of rose leaves. The hero, for there is a real one, is a man of 
the quality every woman must love, i 

The story is unique in many ways. The plot is really original and equally pleasing. It is 
not a mystery story, but it will be difficult to guess the conclusion. 

However interesting the plot may be and with however great ingenuity and charm the 
author unfolds her story through breathless or pastoral pages, no less wonderful is her delineation 
of character. Each of her chosen cast has been drawn with the delicate care and artistic touch 
which characterizes Mrs. Kingsley's work.

SOME IMPORTANT AUTUMN BOOKS 



The Iron Trail 

By REX BEACH 

"The reader this time meets Rex Beach at his best." 
Portland Oregonian. "It is a tale of adventure of the most 
exciting 1 kind, and then some." Philadelphia Telegraph. 
Of course you remember Kipling's "If" about the man who 
could keep his head in every emergency. Well, here he is, 
the hero, as Rex Beach has drawn him in his new Alaskan 
story. Illustrated. $1.35 net 



The Coryston Family 

By MRS. HUMPHRY WARD 

A love story, with a heroine who will rank as Mrs. Ward's 
most charming portrayal of young womanhood of to-day ; 
and a dramatic representation of the struggle between the 
radical and aristocratic elements of English society. Lady 
Coryston, by means of her position, money, and character, 
is a power in the land, but fate overtakes her when her chil- 
dren defy her in love and politics.

The Passionate Friends 

By H. G. WELLS 

" I don't want to become some one's possession ! " Around 
this cry of his heroine Mr. Wells has written his newest 
novel. We hear her story in the words of the man she loved 
the man who loved her. He sets it down his story and 
hers for his son to have as a record of life as it is lived 
to-day, and its gropings toward a to-morrow.

The Desired Woman 

By WILL N. HARBEN 

We believe that this is by far the best book Will Harben 
has ever written. In its pages life in Georgia of to-day is 
encountered in all its intensity. Its keynote is the inevi- 
table triumph of love and tolerance, the far-spreading influ- 
ence of good impulses. " Full of strength and interest from 
the beginning to the end," says the New York World, 
and the Krooklvn Standard- Union says, " The story has 
pity and love, the home touch and the heart touch."

The Way Home 



By the Author of " The Inner Shrine," BASIL KING 

" This is by far the most interesting thing Mr. King has 
done. In the best sense of the phrase it is ' a novel that will 
be discussed,' and deservedly, for the questions it raises are 
important and timely questions." Philadelphia Press. 
" For pure eloquence, mounting on steady wing, we do not 
find in recent literature so good an example as this." The. 
Bellman. Illustrated. $1.35 net 

Partners 

By MARGARET DELANO 

Once again in this perfect little story has Mrs. Deland 
portrayed the romance which lies, so often unsuspected, in 
the humblest surroundings. A mother and daughter had 
conducted a country post-office for twenty years. Com- 
plaints to Washington brought about the appointment of a 
new postmaster. Then when there seemed no way out, the 
new postmaster found a solution. Illustrated. $1.00 net 

The House of Happiness

Kate Langley Bosher has found a new field and this new 
book of hers is a contribution to human happiness. It 
arouses the deep, tender sympathy in all of us. The char- 
acters are all breathing, living realities the peppery old 
gentleman from South Carolina, the quaint and unusual 
doctor, the girl of girls, the man and above all Cricket !

A Changed Man 

By THOMAS HARDY 



Here is Hardy at his best, a book to arouse the keen interest 
of every Hardy lover. This new volume has all the wealth 
of Hardy's genius, for the tales in it were written when he 
was at the height of his career. More like condensed novels 
rather than short stories are these tales, many of which are 
entirely new to American readers. "A Changed Man " takes 
the reader at once to Casterbridge and tells the romance of 
a captain of cavalry. Of the other stories, all are rich in 
atmosphere and character, and several are almost mediaeval 
in their power and mystery.

OLD FRIENDS IN NEW DRESS. 

With the recurrent holiday season come 
recurrent books, old friends in new dress. 
Though the familiar features may often be of 
little importance and much disguised, yet they 
do not fail to show themselves, here and there, 
recognizable under all their bravery of new 
trappings and modern modes; and their pres- 
ence is by no means unwelcome. The Preach- 
er's despondent iteration of the truth that there 
is no new thing under the sun that there is 
nothing whereof it may be said, See, this is 
new, for it hath been already of old time, which 
was before strikes no responsive chord in the 
breast of one interested in noting the count- 
less combinations and permutations that take 
place among the limited stock of themes and 
motives available for the use of the literary 
craftsman. It is this very union of a familiar 
idea or plot with a novel setting that charms 
and delights ; for it is sameness in variety that 
we crave, not an absolute newness, which would 
but bewilder and repel. When, for instance, a 
painting is exhibited in which a lady descend- 
ing a flight of stairs is represented by so novel 
a combination of lines and surfaces that the 
beholder cannot distinguish lady from stairs, or 
indeed discern any suggestion of either without 
a previous consultation of the catalogue, the 
feeling is one of mystification and vexation; 
whereas if the representation vividly recalls or 
even remotely suggests a certain concrete in- 
stance of lady and stairs, the resultant sensation 
may be highly pleasurable. 

The elder Disraeli long ago said, in the man- 
ner characteristic of his time, that " one of the 
most elegant of literary recreations is that of 
tracing poetical or prose imitations and simi- 
larities," and that "it forms, it cultivates, it 
delights taste to observe by what dexterity and 
variation genius conceals, or modifies, an original 
thought or image." The reader's enjoyment 
of Wordsworth is not lessened by his recogni- 
tion of an old acquaintance in the line, "The 
child is father of the man." Pope expressed 
the same thought when he wrote, " The boy and 
man an individual makes." Dryden put it, 
"Men are but children of a larger growth." 
And among minor poets, Lloyd has the couplet, 
"For men in reason's sober eyes are children 



464 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1 



but of larger size"; while in Mallet occurs the 
line, "She kissed the father in the child," and 
someone has said in French, " C'est que 1'enfant 
toujours est homme, c'est que 1'homme est 
toujours enfant." 

When the young reader discovers that the 
one-eyed Polyphemus of the ninth book of the 
"Odyssey" is almost identical with the "tre- 
mendous black giant, as high as a tall palm- 
tree, with only one eye in the middle of his 
forehead," described in the third voyage of 
Sindbad the Sailor, and further remarks the 
slight variations in the two legends as, for 
example, the employment of ten red-hot spits in 
the one version to perform the office of the 
single immense implement in the other a new 
interest is imparted both to Homer and to the 
Arabian tales that are separated from Homer 
by many centuries of time. The usual order of 
reading the wanderings of Odysseus and the 
inventions of Scheherazade is, as indicated here, 
the reverse of the chronological, but need not 
therefore lessen the pleasure of tracing the re- 
semblances and differences in the two versions 
of the Cyclops myth. If also the young reader 
chances to discover a certain likeness to Sche- 
herazade in the biblical Esther, the interest is 
further enriched and enlarged. But, on second 
thought, it is altogether probable that the young 
reader, if he be not a prig, will care not a straw 
for these studies in comparative literature until 
he has grown into an old reader. 

Another familiar example. A reader of the 
Sherlock Holmes stories will enjoy them none 
the less for their reminding him of the preter- 
natural acuteness of observation displayed by 
Voltaire's Zadig in that ingenious episode of 
chapter three which begins, " Un jour, se prome- 
nant auprds d'un petit bois," etc. Also, to cite 
still another familiar instance, one's enjoyment 
of Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" is likely to 
be heightened by a previous acquaintance with 
the "Morte d'Arthur," despite the fact that 
Charles Eliot Norton feels bound to confess, in 
his recently-published letters, that he found the 
step from Malory to Tennyson a descent. " I 
like old Sir Thomas Malory better," he says. 
In the same department of literature, once 
more, the lover of Wagner's "Parsifal" will 
trace with zest the influence of Chretien de 
Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach. But 
enough of these ancient illustrations, which 
will more than suffice to emphasize the truth, 
lately re-affirmed by the genial author of "A 
One-Sided Autobiography," that it is "like 
meeting an old friend to come across the same 



plot, or incident, or figure, or even verbal 
expression, in writers of different times and 
different lands." 

In turning over some recent numbers of the 
" Easy Chair," attention was attracted to a witty 
and playful disquisition on current American 
fiction, in the course of which occurred the 
following (the immediate connection of which 
is unimportant) : " The fact was interestingly 
illustrated a little while ago, in the contrasting 
receptions which American and English criti- 
cism gave an American novel treating of the 
average American life, in characters drawn from 
those wide levels of society which were once our 
boast. It was a simple story of the fortunes of 
a country minister and his family : kindly, hu- 
man folks, with the foibles as well as the virtues 
of their sort. The father was proud of his chil- 
dren and of his wife's housekeeping and thrift, 
and the mother was of a satisfaction in their 
sense and beauty, and his learning and righteous- 
ness, which extended to her own gifts of repartee 
and fatuous inconsequence of mind. A series of 
dramatic accidents deprived them of the little 
competence which they had enjoyed ; the engage- 
ment of the eldest son was broken off by the par- 
ents of his betrothed ; the youngest was buncoed 
out of part of the little money that remained. 
The father lost the parish where he had long 
been loved and honored, and was glad to find 
one among farmers and laborers, with whom his 
wife and daughters were obliged to associate. 
The elder daughter was deceived by a mock 
marriage, and the false lover had the effrontery 
to pursue the younger after the ruin of her 
sister. This scoundrel found means to persecute 
the father and to secure his imprisonment, while 
the family sank lower and lower into misery. 
Then, by the magic which novelists possess, the 
uncle of the wicked lover offers himself to the 
younger daughter, the father is freed from jail, 
and restored to the enjoyment of his property 
and his old parish; the daughter's marriage 
turns out to have been performed by a real 
clergyman ; the eldest son's engagement is re- 
newed; the sharper who plundered the boy is 
arrested, and all ends happily." This unex- 
pected meeting with our old friend Dr. Primrose, 
even in skeleton, was an agreeable surprise, and 
it also aroused a momentary query whether by 
any possibility the writer could have had in mind 
an actual American work of fiction so unblush- 
ingly built upon this well-known English found- 
ation a query rather encouraged than silenced 
by the fact that the outline, as here quoted, dif- 
fers from Goldsmith in one or two particulars^

as in the " series of dramatic accidents," which 
is wholly lacking in the " Vicar," and in making 
the youngest son, instead of the third from the 
youngest, the sharper's victim. But although 
the facetious occupant of the Easy Chair pre- 
serves his gravity throughout his subsequent dis- 
cussion of the supposed "American novel," we 
shall spend no time hunting for the book, nor 
shall we make miserable the lives of any libra- 
rians or assistant librarians in trying to procure 
its identification, content to have had this chance 
meeting with an old friend in epitomized form, 
and to have enjoyed the Easy Chair-man's 
innocent little hoax. 

In an actual American novel of the present 
year, and one that has figured conspicuously 
among the "best-sellers," a spiritual struggle 
is depicted that is essentially like that which 
made "Robert Elsmere" so engrossing with 
readers not of a frivolous turn of mind a quarter- 
century ago. John Hodder has, of course, his 
own special problems and perplexities, but it 
is an interest of a similar sort that is awakened 
by both the English and the American story, 
and that waits to be awakened again and again 
by whatsoever master shall choose to refashion 
the old materials in new form. Another note- 
worthy book of the season carries the reader to 
the rice swamps of South Carolina and shows 
a plucky woman wrestling with the problems 
of plantation-management, just as Mrs. Raven- 
ell's life of Eliza Pinckney presented an earlier 
experience of the same sort in the same imme- 
diate region, though under more favorable 
auspices. "A Woman Rice Planter," the auto- 
biographic record of one who signs herself 
"Patience Pennington," has in its pages so 
much that is new and distinctive, and the writer 
is evidently a person of so heroic traits (mod- 
estly and unconsciously revealed), that no addi- 
tion of reminiscent interest, of parallelism with 
an earlier narrative, such as is here indicated, 
was needed to insure the book an eager reading; 
but it will not suffer by reason of that addition. 

Although, as Whittier says, "the new tran- 
scends the old," he presently adds that "the 
olive waves with roots deep set in battle graves." 
It would be but a thin and unsatisfying new- 
ness that did not spring from the old and carry 
much of the old with it. The same familiar 
joys and sorrows of the race have to be 
felt in new form by each individual, the very 
fact of their antiquity and their commonness 
giving value and meaning to the fresh expe- 
rience. The time-worn themes of literature, 
like abraded coins, have to be reminted ; even 



the separate words that clothe them lose their 
power of vivid appeal, and new ones, or new 
applications of the old ones, are called upon to 
take their place. The products, too, of the 
illustrator's art that adorn the books of one 
generation cease to be wholly satisfying when 
the next generation has grown to maturity. 
Hence the pleasing certainty that each succes- 
sive Christmas season will in the future, as in 
the past, see the bookshops overflowing with 
literary wares not only attractive to the passing 
shopper, but necessary to the transmission of 
the torch from hand to hand down through the 
ages. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE REGION OF THE UNROMANTic, where statis- 
tics displace sentiment, and hard-and-fast certainty 
crowds out all the delightful possibilities that love 
to lurk in the penumbra of the uncertain and the 
problematical, is deemed by some to be the chosen 
abiding-place of librarians. Especially does the 
presiding genius of the information desk have the 
reputation of one who scorns the delights of vague- 
ness and lives laborious days in clearing the cob- 
webs of dubiety from his mind and in flooding its 
every nook and corner with the pitiless glare of the 
light of positive knowledge. The English delegate 
who attended our late A. L. A. annual conference 
reports to his fellow-librarians at home on this zeal 
of our librarians for reducing the unknown if not 
the unknowable to its lowest terms. " It is difficult, 
perhaps," he says in the course of his report, 4< just 
at this time to estimate the intellectual and spiritual 
loss entailed on the race of men by the reaching of 
the two poles, reducing almost to the vanishing 
point those places of the earth where imagination 
may still lose itself untrammeled by the deadening 
reality of the topographer and the map-maker, and 
foreshadowing the time when it will be as easy to get 
to the poles as it is to Bournemouth. Let us express 
the hope that the librarians may leave the poles and 
a few other areas of what Bacon calls the Globe 
Intellectual in their virgin remoteness, untouched 
as long as may be by the 'civilizing' influences of 
the cataloguer, the bibliographer, and all those 
agencies for hustled information which centre them- 
selves in that generally speaking excellent, but 
unromantic, department of the American public 
library known as the Information Desk." But after 
all, there is no real cause for alarm. As Herbert 
Spencer long ago reminded his readers, the enlarg- 
ing of the sphere of the known, so far from dimin- 
ishing the volume of the unknown, only increases 
the amount of surface exposed to that circumjacent 
element, or, in other words, multiplies our points of 
contact with it and makes its magnitude more 
appreciable to the senses.

A VANISHING TYPE OF SCHOLARSHIP, such schol- 
arship as the late Dr. Furness possessed in addition to 
his vast store of Shakespeare learning, and such as 
Charles Eliot Norton had acquired together with his 
special erudition as an eminent Dantean, is pictured 
in the following "words of a contemporary," ap- 
pended to the recently published "Letters" of Mr. 
Norton: "The prescribed curriculum of our day 
for it had not changed much down to the time of 
the war had one great advantage, that it made a 
solidarity or freemasonry of knowledge among the 
graduates, which in the modern system must be very 
much lost. All graduates [of Harvard] possessed 
a common fund of learning and training which, as 
far as it went, represented what was expected to be 
known by those who called themselves educated 
men what had been handed down in the modern 
world as the summary of necessary human knowl- 
edge. And what was taught was taught accurately. 
Slovenly students there were who scraped through, 
but such a type as a slovenly teacher was to me 
almost unknown. To be a professor at Harvard 
under the old system was to be a 'master of those 
who know.' In this, Child, Lowell, Gray, Gurney, 
Longfellow, Lane, Torrey, Goodwin, Peirce all 
the members of the Faculty resembled each other. 
They were not merely specialists, but belonged to the 
old fraternity of scholars to none of whom any branch 
of learning was alien. The atmosphere in which 
they lived was almost entirely academic. The idea 
of a college as a place primarily for distinction in 
sport, or even primarily for 'vocational' objects, 
would have filled them with aversion." It used to be 
said of President Chad bourne of Williams that he 
was capable of holding any of the professorships in 
the college. Could a like assertion be made of any 
college president to-day? 

INTELLIGENT BOOKSELLING, as practiced by the 
alert and cheerful salesman or saleswoman, well 
informed on literature in general and familiar with 
every book in the shop, is always a delight to the 
book-buyer. In marked contrast to this intelligent 
and wide-awake person is the dull-eyed attendant 
not seldom met with at the book-counter of the 
twentieth-century department store, whose look 
brightens with no glad response when perchance 
request is made for a copy of Johnson's " Rasselas " 
or Mrs. Shelley's "Frankenstein." Instead, there 
probably comes a weary request to repeat the title, 
and then a hopeless shake of the head in half- 
doubtful negation, or a vague shuffling of the piles 
of current fiction as if in forlorn hope of discovering 
the book beneath "T. Tembarom" or mixed up 
with "The Coryston Family" and "The Passionate 
Friends." The "Bulletin" of the Authors' League 
of America calls attention to the indisputable fact 
that the sales-clerk is a " most vital factor in the 
make-up of a successful book shop," and it reprints 
from the London "Book Monthly" the following, 
which will be news to many readers: "It may not 
be known on this side of the Atlantic that there is 



now a bookseller's school in America. It has just 
closed a successful first year with good promise of 
becoming a permanent institution. The idea of it 
was to help young men in the book trade to acquire 
fuller knowledge of that trade in an all-round way. 
Lectures were delivered sometimes in the great 
book shops of New York amid very fitting surround- 
ings. This shows us that modern America appre- 
ciates the ancient craft of bookselling, and that if 
we are not careful she will be producing better 
booksellers than we do." 



PLEA FOR A RESEARCH INSTITUTE is made by 
Mr. Aksel G. S. Josephson, chairman of the recently 
constituted Committee on Research Institute, in a 
circular letter reprinted from "Science" of July 11, 
1913. Fifty thousand dollars, or ten thousand an- 
nually for five years, would suffice to establish the 
proposed institute on a firm basis. It would soon 
become partly self-supporting, or such is the expecta- 
tion, since its practical value to commerce, manufac- 
tures, and agriculture would be speedily recognized 
and its services gladly paid for. It would, says Mr. 
Josephson, " collect titles from all sources and of all 
dates on a definite number of subjects, concerning 
which information is actually wanted." It would 
seek the cooperation of similar establishments in 
other countries, such as the Institut International 
de Bibliographie, at Brussels, and the Internationales 
Institut fur Sozialbibliographie, at Berlin. And if 
with the starting of the proposed research institute 
there could also be called into being that bibliothecal 
desideratum, a central library for libraries, for the 
collection and preservation of those large and expen- 
sive publications (serials, transactions, costly refer- 
ence books, and so on) that only a few separate 
libraries can now afford to buy, what more fitting 
headquarters for the researchers could be conceived 
of than this Central Library for Libraries? The 
activities of the two organizations would fit together 
and supplement each other like the two blades of a 
pair of scissors not the worst possible comparison 
in connection with a clipping bureau. Seriously, 
there is every reason to desire and to hope for the 

early success of the plan here inadequately outlined. 



THE IDEAL EDITOR, as conceived by Charles 
Eliot Norton, who had himself had considerable 
editorial experience in connection with "The North 
American Review," the New England Loyal Pub- 
lication Society, and in other less direct ways, is not 
one whose policy is dictated to him by the capitalist 
or capitalists financing his journal. As is well said 
by Norton's brother-in-law, Mr. Arthur Sedgwick, in 
a supplementary chapter to the Norton "Letters," 
" The modern idea of an editor as a mere agent for 
the dissemination of readable papers on all sides of 
all subjects, however inconsistent with each other or 
with his own opinions, would have been intolerable 
to him; the object he had in view was a publication 
for which he was willing to be responsible, with a 
wide range of topics and discussion, but always 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



467 



with the idea of advancing what he believed to be 
the truth. It was the adherence to this plan the 
tradition of editorship, once almost universal 
which gave the periodical press of fifty years ago a 
weight for which no sensationalism and no amount 
of contributors' names can ever make up. When 
the publication spoke, it spoke for itself; with the 
combined force of all the brains and character and 
repute behind it." In harmony with this ideal were 
Norton's habits and methods in all his literary and 
editorial work. " Like all men who are conscientious 
about their work," writes Mr. Sedgwick, " he took 
the most careful pains with everything he did, leav- 
ing no stone unturned to avoid inaccuracy and error, 
and even all looseness of expression. He detested 
exaggeration. This made his style sometimes seem 
laboured, and affected his letters and conversation. 
But it was as far removed as possible from that 
preciseness of speech, tone, and style which affecta- 
tion sometimes produces." 



THE OVERWORKED PHRASE probably causes a 
fastidious reader even more annoyance and bore- 
dom than does the startlingly new and boldly dar- 
ing idiom. Fertility of invention speaks in the 
novel epithet or unhackneyed metaphor ; mental 
sloth and poverty of imagination betray themselves 
in the outworn turn of expression and the thread- 
bare bit of imagery. Every reader of fine taste has 
a dislike for the author whose characters are forever 
" getting in touch with " this, that, or the other per- 
son, or are " by way of being " amateur concholo- 
gists, or are engaged " in the same line " of research, 
or are working "along different lines," or are wait- 
ing for their expectations to "materialize," or, in 
the hunting field, are noted for their skill in " nego- 
tiating" a hedge or a ditch. What an exhilarating 
effect it has on a reader to encounter an author who 
uses only an irreducible minimum of ready-made 
phrases. There is no somnolence possible in read- 
ing sentences every one of which brings to birth a 
new and exquisitely apt or strikingly picturesque 
idiom. The London "Times," in a recent comment 
on stock phrases, says that where such phrases 
abound and the demand on the reader's attention is 
consequently small, "he may like this little holiday; 
indeed, some writers are popular just because their 
stock phrases are so numerous that the reader's 
mind can enjoy a complete idleness among them." 
This kind of popularity, if it really exists, is decid- 
edly not a popularity to be envied. 

A BIG CITY WITHOUT A PUBLIC LIBRARY is 

almost as hard to find in this land of enlightenment 
as a town without a telephone or a village without 
a post-office. But recent reports from Virginia will 
have reminded those interested in the extension of 
our public library system that in the capital of that 
State we see a city of considerably more than one 
hundred thousand inhabitants still unprovided with 
what is certainly not the least of educational agen- 
cies. No other city in the United States, fortunately, 



can show a population exceeding the hundred- 
thousand mark and at the same time a lack of public 
provision for the literary needs of its citizens. The 
Business Men's Club of Richmond, however, is now 
bestirring itself in an endeavor to procure the estab- 
lishment of a library by the city, and early success 
is hoped for. Professor Metcalf, of Richmond Col- 
lege, has spoken before the club and called atten- 
tion to the benefit sure to accrue from the starting 
of a public library. What such an institution can 
do for a community he illustrates by pointing to the 
cities of Nashville and Grand Rapids, each of about 
the size of Richmond. The Nashville library is 
freely used by artisans and business men, as well as 
by students and persons of leisure. No fewer than 
36 blacksmiths, 563 bookkeepers, 483 brokers, 70 
carpenters, 69 cash boys, 1859 clerks, 2000 labor- 
ers, 1748 merchants, and 741 stenographers are 
enjoying its privileges, says Mr. Metcalf, who dis- 
closes an unfavorable contrast in his own city, where 
current books of importance are in so little demand 
that even Mr. Bryce's volume on South America 
has had but ten buyers. Were a public library 
once established, dozens of useful books on the 
countries to the south of us would be freely avail- 
able to all, and would be read by many. That so 
necessary a part of municipal equipment, in this day 
and generation, should still be lacking to Richmond, 
is cause for surprise. 

THIS YEAR'S AWARD OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN 
LITERATURE is for the first time to an Asiatic, 
the Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore, who has 
visited both England and America and given public 
lectures on the literary renaissance that for nearly 
a century has been in progress in Bengal, and of 
which his own poetry is the most noteworthy product. 
Mr. Yeats's introduction to " Gitanjali " is the chief 
source of what is popularly known of him in the En- 
glish-speaking world; and from that we become 
aware that the Bengali poet enjoys at home a renown 
such as perhaps no living European poet can claim 
among his own countrymen. Only of late has some 
impression of his genius been conveyed to us through 
the medium of translation as if a poet could ever 
be translated. "To read one line of his is to forget 
all the troubles of the world," declares an enthusi- 
astic admirer; and he is as gifted in music as in 
poetry, his songs being sung wherever Bengali is 
spoken. He comes of a family of distinguished men : 
two of his brothers are artists, and another is a noted 
philosopher. A greater interest in Rabindranath 
Tagore will now be aroused in Europe and America 
by reason of the late award of the Nobel prize. 

ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE'S IMPATIENCE OF 
BOOK-LEARNING was undoubtedly one of the factors 
that operated to make him a leader in science and a 
conspicuously independent and original thinker and 
writer. Now that the voice and pen of this eminent 
nonagenarian have fallen silent, it is interesting to 
look back upon his schoolboy days in Monmouthshire

and to see him chafing under the irksome restraints 
of the schoolroom and condemning as useless the 
antiquated methods of instruction there employed. 
To him, at least, the printed page could convey no 
lesson comparable in importance with that of the 
larger page of nature; and he was but seventeen 
years old when the love of botany and the collector's 
passion seized him. Of his subsequent wanderings 
and explorations as a naturalist, the story is a long 
one, and may best be read in the autobiographic 
work, *' My Life," which came out a few years ago. 
Probably his best-known contribution to the litera- 
ture of science is his volume on " Darwinism," which 
many readers have found more easily mastered than 
the writings of the great evolutionist himself. Other 
and later works of importance are his "Studies, 
Scientific and Social," "The Wonderful Century," 
"Man's Place in the Universe," and "The World 
of Life." A complete list of his writings, including 
those published in periodicals, would more than fill 
one of these pages. ... 

EXTRAORDINARY VALUE IN AN ALMANAC comes 
to our notice in the recent auction sale of a 32-page 
pamphlet bearing the title: "Calendrier Francais

esting memento of the French aid rendered to us in 
our time of greatest need. It went, appropriately,

COMMUNICATIONS. 



THE STEVENSON FELLOWSHIP DINNER. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It may interest your readers to know that on the 
evening of November 13 there occurred in San Fran- 
cisco the ninth annual meeting of the Stevenson Fellow- 
ship, an organization which held its initial meetings in 
1901 and 1902, in the Bush Street restaurant where in 
1879 Robert Louis Stevenson ate his frugal meals. In 
the march of improvements the little restaurant gave 
way to a larger building, which, in turn, yielded to the 
great fire of 1906; but the Fellowship, without formal 
organization, has persisted, and year by year, with few 
exceptions, has commemorated the birthday of Steven- 
son by decorating with a wreath of bay the memorial 
fountain erected to his memory in Portsmouth Square, 
and by a dinner with appropriate toasts and addresses. 
Many personal friends of Stevenson have had a part in 
these proceedings, some by letter and others in person. 



Among the former, Sidney Colvin, Will Low, Miss 
Balfour, Alison Cunningham, and Metaafa, the Samoan 
chief, may be named; among the latter, Mrs. Virgil 
Williams, with her husband, the friend of Stevenson's 
San Francisco days, old Jules Simoneau, the French 
restaurant keeper of Monterey with whom Stevenson 
played chess and discussed the universe, and Miss 
Annie Ide (now Mrs. Bourke Cockran) to whom, as a 
child, Stevenson bequeathed his birthday. Now the 
growing years find the personal friends of R. L. S. 
more widely scattered, or passed to join him on the 
other side; but those who cherish his memory, who 
admire his writings and find inspiration in his life and 
character, are no fewer than before. This year sixty 
met around the board to do him honor, having first 
placed a wreath on the monument a few blocks away. 
Here Dr. Edwin T. Wiley, of the University of Cali- 
fornia, gave a short and feeling address on " The 
Optimism of Stevenson," which was followed by the 
reading of Mr. John N. Hilliard's poem, " At the Robert 
Louis Stevenson Fountain." Between the courses of the 
dinner many tributes in prose and verse were read. 
There were messages from several prominent literary 
people, and poems from Ethel Talbot Scheffauer, 
Clarence Urmy, George Sterling, and A. de B. Lovett, 
all testifying to the vital hold Stevenson still has on the 
hearts of men. It is doubtful if the name of any other 
author could be the nucleiis for such a gathering, or 
could call forth such heartfelt tributes of admiration 
and affection, such testimonies of courage revived and 
inspiration received. 

The dinner was followed by a finished and careful 
study of " Stevenson as a Book Reviewer" by Professor 
William Dallam Armes r of the University of California. 
These early book reviews of Stevenson's are not familiar 
to the average reader, since they were not deemed 
worthy of a place in the permanent collections of his 
writings. The researches of Professor Armes brought 
to light brilliant passages of satirical wit not unworthy 
of Stevenson's later years, and some sharp thrusts only 
a little less keen than the invective employed in " Father 
Damien." Some of the opinions expressed are amusing 
for a quality of cocksureness which Stevenson would 
probably have modified in later years.

THE GREATEST OF AMERICAN 
SCULPTORS.* 



Augustus Saint-Gaudens left no rival among 
American sculptors, and there are not a few 
who would claim for him the highest position in 
the entire republic of the arts in this country. 
During the last years of his all-too-short sojourn 
among us he found leisure to dictate the frag- 
ments of an autobiography. Sickness, weak- 
ness, and finally death prevented his carrying 
the work to completion ; but, like several of his 
sculptural sketches, the project has been taken 
up by another, and in this instance at least the 
result is most satisfactory. The artist's son, Mr. 
Homer Saint-Gaudens, is a writer by profession, 
and naturally his best efforts have been enlisted 
in this labor of filial piety. He has united 
and amplified the precious fragments (though 
always keeping them distinct from his own con- 
tribution through the use of a separate font of 
type), and his familiarity with his subject, his 
sympathy and frank admiration for his father's 
achievement, make this work a delightfully 
intimate and illuminating resume of an excep- 
tional life. It is something that was needed, 
and it is an occasion for gratitude that the task 
fell to hands so competent. 

The strongest impression that comes to one in 
reading these volumes is of the immense activity 
of the man's life and of his splendid citizenship. 
He seems to have been seized early with the 
conviction that however fine a thing it may be 
to be an artist, it is a vastly finer thing to be an 
artist-citizen. Probably he never formulated a 
confession of faith ; but there was within him a 
generous impulse, an innate sense of the respon- 
sibilities as well as of the power of art, which 
pointed the way toward a continual expansion 
of his interests and sympathies. 

Opportunity was his in abundance, and his 
associates were men of affairs and broad outlook. 
Given such an environment, it was inevitable 
that this retiring and ever-modest man should 
be marked from the first to become a national 
figure. One can imagine another, possibly quite 
as perfect a craftsman, with a horizon precisely 
bounded by his studio walls, with interests 
limited to the piece of work upon his modelling 
stand. This could hardly be the case, however, 
with a man who has endeavored to teach. 

*THE REMINISCENCES OF AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS. 
Edited and amplified by Homer Saint-Gaudens. In two 
volumes, illustrated. New York : The Century Co. 



Saint-Gaudens's sympathy with struggling be- 
ginners, with the efforts of his many ardent 
and oft-times bewildered pupils, was the logical 
preparation for larger fields of usefulness. He 
taught for many years the sculpture classes of 
The Art Students' League, and no teacher ever 
had more loyal and appreciative disciples. His 
earliest public effort seems to have been in con- 
nection with the founding of the American Soci- 
ety of Artists, a secession from the National 
Academy of Design. This strong organization 
fulfilled most admirably its purpose, and then 
returned amicably to the parent body. We still 
have lively memories of the master's inestimable 
service as adviser in the planning of the Col- 
umbian Exposition ; the splendid MacMonnies 
fountain, the monumental "Republic," and the 
imposing peristyle were his suggestions among 
many. Later, even in illness, Saint-Gaudens 
took an active share in the work of the import- 
ant National Art Commission in Washington ; 
and finally, in the founding of the American 
Academy in Rome, we have repeated glimpses 
of his glowing enthusiasm and high endeavor. 
Indeed, so strongly did this notable enterprise 
appeal to him that he overcame for the moment 
his almost invincible terror of speaking in pub- 
lic, and made an address for the cause at a great 
dinner in Washington. It is safe to say that no 
hope of personal gain could ever have persuaded 
him to attempt this. Obviously such service 
cannot be bought or recompensed. In all of his 
noble enthusiasms, Saint-Gaudens exemplified 
Thoreau's admirable words : " An efficient and 
valuable man does what he can whether the 
community pay him for it or not." 

One of our up-to-date and therefore irrev- 
erent young critics has recently observed that 
if there were no more passion in real life than 
is to be found in Mr. Howells's characters, 
then there are some eighty or ninety millions of 
us who would not be here at all ! One has at 
first something of the same feeling in reading 
Saint-Gaudens's chronicle of his work. One 
protests that surely there must have been more 
emotion than this behind those magnificent 
achievements. Is it possible that masterpieces 
which speak to us so convincingly, which fairly 
thrill us over and over again, have had no pas- 
sionate conception, no tender development, in 
the soul of the artist ? This is unbelievable. Is 
it not more likely that Saint-Gaudens's reticence 
upon the subject is rather a frank acknowledg- 
ment of an emotion too profound and too sacred 
to share with all ? There is no pose in the atti- 
tude of the artist-author. He does not disclaim

[Dec. 1 



the deep feeling which must have given birth 
to the Lincoln, the Shaw, and the Adams 
memorials ; he simply refuses to talk about it to 
the curious crowd. But a man who could labor 
upon a work like the Shaw relief for fourteen 
years, fairly loving it into noble perfection, has 
a right to leave the result to time and to the 
work itself. Yet how we wish that we could 
penetrate the silent past and see the master 
in the midst of his vision, or hear his glad 
cry of exultation over a hard-fought triumph ! 
The book preserves for us one such joyous 
shout, where Saint-Gaudens, engaged upon his 
Sherman, writes playfully to his niece: "I 
think I told you that my 'Victory' is getting 
on well. It is the grandest ' Victory ' anybody 
ever made. Hoorah ! and I shall have the model 
done in a month or so." A studio resounds from 
time to time with many a happy hurrah, but they 
are not often recorded. Of his father's excep- 
tional reserve, Mr. Homer Saint-Gaudens writes : 
" In other directions, however, his autobiography 
fails to awaken an interest beyond that of the more 
outward events of his life. Because of his horror of 
' art talks,' he has given few opinions on art or sculp- 
ture, which frequently seemed good or bad to him only 
through the presence or absence of a peculiar power 
exceeding the reach of definition. Often he would say, 
I could not answer that man, but I knew he was 
wrong.' So with a faith founded more on intuition than 
on theory or reason, he became reluctant to discuss even 
answerable questions." 

True to this characteristic, Saint-Gaudens writes 
in his opening chapter : " If the reader hopes 
to find herein a disquisition on art or the pro- 
duction of artists, it will be well to close the 
book at once. There is nothing of that in these 
pages." 

But what an interesting life was his, what 
privileges of companionship and mental stimulus ! 
The two volumes are full of anecdotes, piquant 
incidents, and experiences ; and one feels that 
there were many more exciting ones behind those. 
Indeed, Saint-Gaudens says himself at the begin- 
ning : " Like everyone else, were I to set down 
everything about myself, as well as everything 
I know of others, I could a tale unfold that 
would make what follows appear like candle- 
light in sunshine ; but various considerations, 
conventional and otherwise, bar the way vexa- 
tiously." One is afforded delightful and some- 
times amusing glimpses of Whistler and La 
Farge, of Robert Louis Stevenson and General 
Sherman, of Richard Watson Gilder, Daniel 
H. Burnham, and many more. We catch old 
Doctor McCosh in innocent prevarication the 
while Stanford White quotes scripture, such 
are some of the surprises of the recital. 



Saint-Gaudens was of humble parentage, and 
probably owed much to this circumstance. The 
one drawback was the lack of systematic educa- 
tion, which hampered him somewhat in utterance, 
so that he always found letter-writing a cruel 
punishment. Time, and intercourse with the 
best, gradually atoned in great measure for these 
deficiencies, and we find his diction always as 
simple and purposeful as his clay sketches 
developing in flexibility and charm before our 
very eyes. It is safe to say that he might have 
become an admirable writer. As it is, these 
pages betoken the kind of man that he was, 
recalling in their unpretentious directness the 
autobiography of General Grant, showing the 
same quiet humor, and strangely enough written 
amid circumstances of similar heroic patience. 
Born in Dublin in 1848, of a French father 
and an Irish mother, America's greatest sculptor 
grew up in New York City with his father's 
little shoe-shop as his principal background. It 
chanced that at an early age he was apprenticed 
to a cameo-cutter. It was upon this slender 
thread of the fates that depended our country's 
good fortune ! Had his parents selected any one 
of a hundred other callings, his life would doubt- 
less have remained as colorless and inglorious as 
that of the boy next door. It was not entirely 
chance, however, that turned the scales, for he 
tells us: 

" But, now, since I was just thirteen, my father said 
to me one day: 'My boy you must go to work. What 
would you like to do ? ' 

" ' I don't care,' I replied, ' but I should like it if I 
could do something which would help me to be an 
artist.' 

" Consequently father apprenticed me to a man 
named Avet, a Savoyard, dark, with a mustache which 
extended down along the side of his cheek and jaw. 
When he was not scolding me he sang continuously. I 
believe that I am not wrong in stating that he was 
the first cameo-cutter in America, though stone seal- 
engravers there were already in New York, as well as 
shell cameo-engravers, at which occupation Palmer and 
Launt Thompson were adepts in the early periods of 
their careers. For it was the fashion at that time for 
men to wear stone scarf-pins with heads of dogs, horses 
and lions cut in amethyst, malachite and other stones. 
I was Avet's first apprentice and the stones I prepared 
for him he would finish, occasionally allowing me to 
complete one myself. He was employed principally 
by Messrs. Ball, Black, & Company, who had their store 
on the corner of Spring Street and Broadway, and now 
and then by Tiffany, to both of which shops I took 
cameos when completed, always with a profound 
impression of the extraordinary splendor of those 
places." 

At the end of three years the youth took his 
last scolding, packed up his belongings, and 
went home ; and another period of three years 
happy ones this time was begun in the

shop of a shell-cutter. During all this time he 
was studying drawing in the night classes of 
Cooper Union or The Academy of Design. 
Thus, at the age when the average educated 
man begins his special studies, this youth was 
thoroughly grounded in drawing and already a 
master of low relief, a master in the sense in 
which no belated beginner ever becomes a mas- 
ter, for with him it was both mental and phys- 
ical mastery. 

In February, 1867, the boy of nineteen 
sailed for Paris, with a steerage ticket and a 
fortune of one hundred dollars in his pocket, 
and his cameo-cutter's kit for his principal bag- 
gage. Of the school days at the Beaux-Arts 
there are delightful glimpses. Here, for in- 
stance, is the description of the Professor : 

" Jouffroy was tall, thin, dark, wiry, with little intel- 
ligent black eyes and a queer face in profile, his fore- 
head and nose descending in a straight line from the 
roots of his hair to within an inch of the end of his 
nose, which suddenly became red and round and pim- 
ply though the ball was discreet in size ; it would 
have been in bad taste had it been larger. He also had 
stringy hair and a nasal voice. He made his criticism 
in a low, drawling tone, nine-tenths of the time in a 
perfunctory way, looking in an entirely different direc- 
tion from the model and from the study. Occasionally 
he worked on the figures in a strange fashion, his right 
hand pawing the clay, while in his left he held a little 
wad of bread which he constantly rolled. He was 
much in vogue at the Tuileries at that time, although 
he achieved his distinction some ten or fifteen years 
before my arrival." 

There was a famous walking trip in Switzer- 
land with comrades of the atelier, and later, 
upon the opening of the Franco-Prussian war, 
a visit to Italy which prolonged itself ultimately 
to a stay of some five years. Now follow the 
familiar and sometimes plaintive stories of the 
early essays at professional work, the hopes and 
disappointments. The beautiful angel reliefs 
which Saint- Gaudens modeled from drawings 
of John La Farge for St. Thomas's Church in 
New York were the chief work of 1877, and 
did much to win friends. They were destroyed 
by fire a few years ago. The story of the 
struggle to obtain the Farragut commission is 
a tense one, and we realize how near we came 
to losing a masterpiece. From the moment, in 
May, 1881, that this monument was unveiled 
in Madison Square, New York, Saint- Gaudens 
became a public character, taking his place at 
the head of American sculpture ; for the un- 
known young sculptor had made the finest 
portrait statue in this country, to be sur- 
passed only by himself. 

There is a picturesque account of an eventful 



journey in 1883 through the far west, from the 
wastes of Arizona to Tacoma, and thence home. 
It concludes as follows : 

" The night we crossed the plains of Kansas we went 
through the gilt-edged edition of Hell. But I had one 
recompense. The sleeping-car conductor, after hard 
spelling, got my name. ' Why, you 're the man who 
made that great statue in New York? Well I declare! 
Allow me to congratulate you! ' Then a squeeze with 
his big fist. Such is fame." 

Of the evolution of the Shaw Memorial, 
that extraordinary bronze relief which pictures 
so poignantly the white commander leading his 
colored regiment to almost certain death, Mr. 
Homer Saint- Gaudens says: 

" Through fourteen years of such endeavor, then, the 
Shaw relief remained in the studio, while other com- 
missions came and went ; fourteen years, during which 
my father returned to this work winter and summer 
with an unflagging persistence. Even the hottest of 
August days would find him high up on a ladder under 
the baking skylight, as he developed and eliminated 
these details of his task ; for the details, as has been 
seen, he changed and changed, though the original con- 
ception, according to his almost consistent practice, he 
never altered. Early morning would grow to noon, 
scarcely marked by more than a hasty munching of an 
apple. Noon would fade to dusk without a falter in the 
steady toil. And then, after the evening meal, he would 
take his place again beneath the flaring gas jets when 
the special task was of a sort to permit night work." 

And Saint-Gaudens betrays his own enthusiasm 
in writing to Mrs. Van Rensselaer : 

" I 've done nothing but model, model, model furi- 
ously for the last month. I've been putting negroes of 
all types in the Shaw, and it 's been great fun. I'm as 
happy as a clam over it, and consequently beautifully 
negligent of every friend, no matter how much they 
may have passed before my vision as I was driving 
away at my darkeys." 

Every incident in connection with the growth 
of the "Lincoln," the "Deacon Chapin," above 
all the mysterious Adams Memorial of Washing- 
ton, is of surpassing interest. It is wonderful 
to get into the studio and watch the progress of 
these mighty works, to see the original sketches 
and their rejected rivals, and to imagine what 
the work might have been had the artist's taste 
wandered to another choice. 

Of the Columbian Exposition and Saint- 
Gaudens's part therein much is said. He writes 
thus of the MacMonnies fountain : 

" I then urged that the execution be placed in his 
hands, and there is no other piece of work with which I 
have been associated as adviser that has approached 
this in the satisfaction it has given me. It seemed to 
fit in absolutely with his temperament, with his appre-r 
ciation of the joy of life, beauty, and happiness, and 1 
consider his composition as a whole, and particularly 
the central motive of the boat, the rowing maidens, the 
young figure of America on top, the most beautiful

conception of a fountain of modern times west of the 
Caspian Mountains. It was the glorification of youth, 
cheerfulness, and the American spirit, and I think it is 
a calamity greatly to be deplored that it should have 
gone to ruin. It would have made a remarkable 
.monument to that extraordinary exhibition. 

" The days that I passed there linger in the memory 
like a glorious dream, and it seems impossible that such 
.a vision can ever be recalled in its poetic grandeur and 
elevation. Certainly it has stood far beyond any of 
the expositions, great as they have been, that have 
succeeded it." 

Of a magnificent building which Chicago 
permits to fall to decay as it permitted the 
destruction of the MaoMonnies fountain, Mr. 
Burnham writes to Mr. Homer Saint-Gaudens : 

"The Art Building had just been finished. Your 
father came to my rooms late in the afternoon. He took 
tore by the shoulders and said, Old fellow, do you realize 
the rank of Atwood's building ? In my judgment, it is 
the best thing done since the Parthenon.' This con- 
clusion has been justified by the statements of many 
eminent critics." 

Saint-Gaudens ".discovered" the little town 
of Cornish, N. H., and loved it more than any 
other. spot on earth. Much of his later work 
was done there, and there for many months he 
peacefully awaited death, guiding his studio 
force from his sick bed to the very end. He 
died on August 3, 1907. 

One of the most charming bits in the whole 
work, and wonderfully true in local color, is 
the following glimpse of the maturer artist life 
in Paris, showing the gift of the French to find 
interest and contentment amid surroundings of 
the humblest character. The occasion was a 
flying visit to Paris in 1889 : 

"I was there but two weeks and was desirous of 
returning in what measure I could to my student life 
and environment, and, for that reason, occupied a little 
box of a room that MacMonnies offered to me fronting 
on a charming court where he had his studio. The first 
day, on awakening, I turned to the tiny window over- 
looking the little garden in the cool gray of the morn- 
ing. Presently, from one of the; studio doors which 
opened on the court, an old chap appeared in his 
dressing-gown, peacefully smoking a pipe. He trudged 
along in among the paths over to one particular flower- 
bed which was evidently his little property, and with 
great care watered the flowers with a diminutive water- 
ing-pot. Soon another codger appeared from another 
door, in trousers and slippers. He also fussed and 
shuffled quietly in his little plot. And then a third 
came from the other end of the garden, with a skull- 
cap on. This one, with the greatest caution, mounted 
a step-ladder, tying here and cutting away there, among 
his plants, while the others raked away in the earth below 
among the flowers, and murmured and chatted about 
this little plant, and that little flower, this bit of earth 
and so on, with apparently no other thought than that 
of the Greek in 'Candide ' to 'Cultivate your garden '; 
the blue smoke from their pipes of peace rising philoso- 
phically among the greenery in harmony with it all. 
These were the Satanic comrades of my youth at the 



Beaux-Arts, the Devils who made me bawl Marseillaise 
for months, and it was all so far away from the Hell's 
Kitchen of Thirty-fourth Street and Broadway that it 
gave me much to reflect on." 

The many illustrations in these two volumes 
are of exceptional beauty and interest. The 
great works are adequately shown. Particu- 
larly fascinating are the sketches and studies 
for these well-known figures, and an unlooked- 
for revelation is found in the sculptor's whim- 
sical caricatures of himself and his friends. 

The volumes are singularly free from errors. 
But there never was a book without some mis- 
takes, so its editor will pardon us for calling 
attention to the fact that Saint-Gaudens's 
"enthusiasm for Rodin's early work such as the 
'St. John Preaching'" could not have been 
" revived by the production of 'Age of Brass,' " 
since the last-named was Rodin's initial achieve- 
ment and was followed by the "St. John." 
"Brieux" and "Donnay" are not the names 
of eminent sculptors, though given as such. In 
1875-1877 George Bissell was undoubtedly 
"as active as ever," but it chances that he had 
not yet taken up sculpture. The use of Frederick 
MacMonnies's boyhood name of William in later 
chapters is confusing, and the familiar misspell- 
ing of French names is regrettable. But these 
are small matters, easily overlooked in the great 
pleasure which this brave and cheery recital will 
afford every person of culture. Saint-Gaudens 
has left us his great message for all time in his 
monuments; but this is a supplementary, hu- 
manizing revelation, a sort of hand-clasp and 
good-bye which will keep his personality vivid 
in our memories. Would that the grateful 
thanks of a nation could reach him ! 

LORADO TAFT. 



CONTEMPORARY VERSE. 



It used to be thought that anthologies were 
the accompaniments of the death of a literature, 
that they partook of the nature of funeral 
wreaths. However this may be, there is cer- 
tainly a mania to-day for weaving these gar- 
lands, and all sorts of expected and unexpected 
persons are putting their hands to the work. If 
their efforts help to increase the reading of poetry 
they are doing the world a service. And per- 
haps the bargain-loving public does prefer to 
buy specimens of fifty or a hundred poets for 
about the same price it would have to pay for

one complete. But from a critical point of view 
we doubt whether the majority of recent anthol- 
ogies are helpful. Certainly anyone is entitled 
to have a bede-roll of favorite poems ; and if he 
or she can induce some publisher to print these 
in a book, it must be convenient and gratifying 
to the compiler. But we must protest against 
these collections being considered canonical; 
we must deny that they have any authority or 
finality of fame. 

It is not so bad in regard to the poetry of 
the past, for most gatherers of poetic flowers 
are content to wander along the roads and ruts 
made by Time. But in the present, which is as 
uncharted as the air is for the aviator, how are 
they to know which way to turn for the most 
beautiful cloud- wreaths ? Contemporary opin- 
ion of poetry is so untrustworthy largely because 
it is ignorant of what is being done. Who for 
instance in England, say circa 1875, would have 
dreamed of including poems by George Darley, 
James Clarence Mangan, Emily Bronte, and 
Edward FitzGerald in a collection of modern 
verse ? Yet, barring the four or five accredited 
poets of the age, these writers are the stars of 
Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's last big, and we 
think otherwise most unsatisfactory, anthology. 
To be a good anthologist requires an almost 
impossible combination of intensity and univer- 
sality of taste. English lyric poetry has had but 
one great editor of this kind, Palgrave ; and 
he failed dismally when he tried to select from 
his contemporaries. Palgrave's indebtedness to 
Tennyson's judgment may have been more than 
is known. Only the divining rod of a great poet 
could have so surely indicated the true veins of 
ore, and Palgrave was not a great poet. In 
America, Frederic Lawrence Knowles gave us 
a nearly perfect, though small, anthology of 
our poets of the past. 

We have before us two recent anthologies, 
one American, "A Little Book of Modern 
Verse"; and one English, "Georgian Poetry, 
1911-1912." The English book seems to con- 
tain a good deal of poetry in solution, but it does 
not crystallize into anything distinct. Most of 
the poems are intolerably long for lyrical verse, 
the writers sprawl and scrawl all over the 
shop. As far as we can see, none of the pieces 
are new or vital or supremely fine. The con- 
cluding "Dirge" has a charming note, but it is 
rather an echo of FitzGerald. " In the Poppy 
Field " is good, but it is reminiscent of Words- 
worth. We shall not be suspected, we hope, 
of any desire to disparage verse ; but we think 
that the prose phantasies of Mr. Hilaire Belloc 



are more poetic in conception and execution 
than anything in this book. On the whole, 
this Georgian poetry is very different from the 
Georgian poetry of a hundred years ago. 

We turn to the American volume and we 
are in another atmosphere. Here, in the main, 
the poems are short and succinct, their outlines 
clear and definite. Nearly every one of the 
American poets quoted has a sense of form, 
both in verbal style and in the evolution of 
their pieces. And poetry is almost as much a 
form as the old French king was. 

As the English anthology only gleans from 
the poetry crop of the last two years, and as 
many of the poets in the American volume date 
back thirty-five or forty years, it would mani- 
festly be unfair to treat the books as represen- 
tative of the two literatures. The American 
book, however, is quite inadequate even as a 
glimpse of what we have done within the limits 
indicated. What system of selection or exclu- 
sion the compiler has followed would be diffi- 
cult to say. Such names as Aldrich, Stedman, 
Stoddard, Bret Harte, Bunner, Sill, Eugene 
Field, Gilder, Lampman, Helen Hunt, Father 
Tabb, and a score of others, who were easily 
contemporaneous with many she quotes, are 
omitted. As far as she does permit herself to 
range, her work has apparently been done with 
good judgment. It is perhaps invidious to 
select from a selection, but we please ourselves 
by naming a few pieces. Miss Louise Imogen 
Guiney's " The Kings " is a superb lyric, hardly 
surpassable in expression ; it may fairly pair off 
with Bryant's great piece, "The Battlefield." 
Frederic Lawrence Knowles's " Love Triumph- 
ant" has a classic perfection indicative of a 
master, dead, alas, too soon. Mr. Arthur 
Colton's "Harps Hung up in Babylon" and 
Mr. Clinton Scollard's " As I Came Down from 
Lebanon" have the lyric movement that stirs 
and the verbal conciseness that stays. Miss 
Helen Gray Cone's "The Ride to the Lady" 
has the Rembrandt gloom and atmosphere of 
the past ; and Miss Anna Hampstead Branch's 
"New York Shop-Girl" has the brightness, 
lightness, and pathos of the present. 

With the additional weight of metal which 
could easily be thrown into it, an American 
anthology of the work of the past thirty-five 
years or so might, we think, be produced which 
would hold its own against a similar English 
volume. Our public is entirely too fond of im- 
porting its literature, art, and wine from abroad. 
Apropos of this, we are tempted to give a story 
which has probably already appeared in print, 



474 



THE DIAL

but which will bear repetition. It was related 
by Mr. Hall Caine as an experience of his own 
in Iceland. He was out in the open country 
with a guide ; and, gazing at the spectacle about 
him, he exclaimed : " Ah, yes ! This is grand, 
this is sublime ! But I came to Iceland to see 
your glaciers. Where are your glaciers?" 
"Glaciers!" said the guide, "why, you are 
sitting on them! " 

We think it is unfortunate that during the 
last generation, during the period when most of 
us were getting more kicks and curses than half- 
pence, attempts have been made to groom and 
boom two American poets for the great succes- 
sion. The first of these was Lanier. He came at 
a juncture when the older American writers were 
looking around for a new laurel wearer, and 
were anxious to please and placate the South. 
He must have been a charming personality, 
brave, good, untiring, eager, and interested in 
many things. And he had considerable com- 
mand over metres, was, in fact, a miniature 
and moral Swinburne. But his intellectual value 
is not great, his criticism being more or less 
absurd. And in poetry he lacked the one thing 
necessary, poetic expression. His first biog- 
rapher admitted that he possessed little verbal 
charm or distinction. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 
in one of his letters, relegated him to the rear 
rank of minor poets, adding that he had never 
talked with more than two or three literary men 
who thought otherwise. Stedman, in his answer 
to this letter, intimated that his own opinion was 
not very different, but that considerations other 
than literary had compelled him to force Lanier's 
rank. English criticism has always smiled at 
the attempt to place him as a great poet. We 
fear that in the end his fate will be something 
like that of Henry Kirke White, who, because 
he was amiable and interesting and had consump- 
tion, was borne for fifty years on the rolls of 
English literature as a great poet, the equal of 
Gray and Collins, Coleridge and Keats. The 
bubble was finally pricked, and White has 
vanished from the field of view. 

William Vaughn Moody is the other poet 
who has received an amount of praise which will 
probably cause a reaction. His reputation was 
made, and largely rests, on his " Ode in Time of 
Hesitation, "a work of great moral force and sus- 
tentation, which echoes the views of an immense 
mass of intelligent readers. We will not criti- 
cize it directly, but will ask if even its warmest 
admirers really rank it with Lowell's "Com- 
memoration Ode." To us, it seems as inferior 
in literary merit as it is in theme and occasion. 



Yet Lowell's poem is fading on our hands. It 
does not hold its colors as do other of his pieces, 
" The Vision of Sir Launfal " or " The Courtin'," 
for example ; or as do the long elegiac poems of 
his rival, Matthew Arnold. There are many rea- 
sons for this. It suffers under the blight which 
seems to await all political poetry. It is too long, 
and is written in that pseudo-Pindaric form 
which is too flabby and ungirt to race well with 
Time. And it is rhetorical. Now a certain 
alloy of rhetoric is needed in poems of length 
to harden and toughen the pure gold of poetry. 
A number of Shakespeare's plays, and the poems 
of Coleridge and Keats, are almost the only con- 
siderable poetic works in the language which are 
without this alloy. But Lowell's " Ode " has 
more of oratory than of poetry. Its effect was 
overwhelming at the time of its production, like 
the effect of a great speech. But, of all the utter- 
ranees of man, great speeches are the hardest 
things to keep alive. All these considerations 
apply to Moody's " Ode " as much as to Lowell's, 
and wise underwriters will hardly insure its 
immortality. CHAELES LEONARD MOORE. 



DRAMATIST.* 



In England, ten years ago, there were cer- 
tain young men of rich promise yet quiet 
dignity who were frequently cited, by the illu- 
minati, as the predestined literary leaders of 
the theatre to-day. They were not leaders 
then, but they were earnest, sincere, self- 
searching; and they never surrendered their 
work to the devouring gaze of the public until 
they really approved it, and were ready to stand 
back of it. These same men are not the lead- 
ers to-day, for some are dead, some diverted 
to other more urgent channels, some finally are 
still struggling vainly for the "new" drama 
which demands two indispensable factors: a 
repertory theatre, with short runs periodically 
repeated ; and a sophisticated public of highly 
cultivated people, cultivated in sensibility and 
emotion, who will not judge, finally, every play 
on the basis of the " happiness " of its ending. 

St. John Emil Clavering Hankin, for some 
inscrutable reason, left the scene with shocking 
suddenness, "arose from life's feast" and 
left behind him a memorial of such striking 
merit and arresting quality that the sense of 
loss will deepen with the passage of time.

his death (1909), he wrote seven plays and 
began an eighth which establish the founda- 
tion of his reputation. Whether, under con- 
temporary conditions, he bade fair to produce 
plays of popular success, it would be hazardous 
to affirm or deny ; but certain it is that he had 
the root of the matter within him. The tone, 
the quality, the point of view, the "philosophy " 
were fresh and nai' ve, and yet naive only in 
their singular sophistication. If Hankin had 
one capital fault, it was the oppressive sense of 
"society," the crushing weight of the upper 
social strata. Once this is conceded, and for- 
gotten, critical judgment will surely own that 
Hankin left upon all of his plays the stamp 
of an alert and shrewd personality, and sur- 
charged his terse creations with a tempera- 
mental charm and color which constitute their 
most poignant excellence. 

In the deeper sense, surely, Hankin was a 
stylist. That he followed Wilde was only an- 
other way of saying, accurately, that he admired 
Wilde extravagantly, employed his methods, 
imitated him deliberately. The quality of the 
amateur, which even the best of Hankin's 
comedies reveal, is, I think, the result of just 
this one thing: he was unable to conceal his 
imitativeness. Yet, despite this patent fault, his 
dialogue is, from the purely dramatic stand- 
point, notably superior to that of the man whom 
he chose as master. For with Wilde, as I have 
more than once pointed out, real characteriza- 
tion, in the deeper sense, is subsidiary to epigram. 
And so we have the singular spectacle of a group 
of characters uttering fascinating, clever gen- 
eralizations in the most frivolous manner, which, 
mutatis mutandis, would be equally appro- 
priate to any of the other characters. Wilde's 
characters cannot be recognized by the epigrams 
which they create; all are equally facile in 
their creation. With eyes closed, we cannot, 
iii Wilde's plays, guess the speaker from his 
overheard conversation. Nevertheless, Wilde's 
conversation is the most scintillating, the most 
delightful, we have had upon the modern English 
stage. It is often not drama, not germane, 
that is, to the emotional content of the play; 
but it is always art. 

Hankin has fairly distanced Wilde in dia- 
logue ; for his characters do two things with sin- 
gular excellence, an excellence superior to that 
exhibited by the irresponsible Wilde. Hankin's 
characters are perfectly self-contained, perfectly 
consistent, both finely conceived and firmly 
grasped. Each new play exhibits strengthening 
of power in this particular the power to create 



characters who always speak and act "in char- 
acter." In the second place, Hankin's char- 
acters speak with a certain sharp neatness, a 
certain distinct finality, which means, in the last 
analysis, that they have the art of expressing 
themselves with an effectiveness and a perti- 
nency more crystalline and more clairvoyant 
than the current speech of life. This is not the 
epigrammatic coruscation of Wilde, the dialectic 
shrewishness of Shaw ; it is a very high form of 
artistic simplicity. The note of naturalness is 
enhanced, rather than vitiated, by the unusual 
skill in interpreting a given situation or in 
realizing a chosen mood. 

In another respect, scarcely less noteworthy 
and modern, Hankin's plays represent the 
newer mode of expressing life through the 
medium of drama. He realized, as dramatists 
now must inevitably realize, that the drama is 
a form of art which must be presumed to be 
literature. To read a play of Hankin's is to 
have a sense of actual happening irrespective of 
the immediate categories of the theatre. There 
is no suggestion of the stage or of the player : 
we have only a sense of real people in real 
situations. By that I mean that in all respects, 
even to the minutest stage-directions, these 
plays are authentic projections, representations, 
of reality. The subconscious, instinctive feelings 
and accompaniments of action are not left to 
the none too ready imaginations of player or 
spectator. We are made to realize how people 
feel from being told, not only what the players 
say, but also how they act and react, intellect- 
ually and emotionally, from the dramatic con- 
junctures which actually arise. A single stage 
direction may give the clue at once to the actor 
and through the actor to the situation. 

"GENERAL BONSOR [too broken with the world's 
ingratitude to protest further]. Boring ! [Follows 
Miss TRIGGS, shaking his poor old head. There is a 
pause while we realize that one of the most tragic 
things in life is to be a bore and to know it. MRS. 
EVERSLEIGH, however, not being cursed with the gift 
of an imaginative sympathy, wastes no pity on the 
General. Instead of this she turns to her sister, and, 
metaphorically speaking, knocks her out of the ring.]" 

This stage direction clearly supplies a certain 
convention for the newer drama. It has the 
virtue of enforcing the intent of the dramatist, 
too often missed through the inefficiency or 
unimaginativeness of the actors. Without press- 
ing home the point too hard, it must be at least 
indicated that stage-directions, however artistic 
or however skilful in enforcing the desired 
effect, should remain impersonal. The printed 
play should be as realistic as fiction ; imperfect

objectivity is the outcome of following Wilde's 
dictum that the drama should be "as personal 
a mode of expression as the lyric or sonnet." 
But the aim which Hankin kept before him, 
despite lapses into too obvious personalism, is 
an aim truly commendable : to interpret situa- 
tions with refined art and wholly graphic effect. 
Hankin's plays, imaginatively conceived, 
artistically executed, transfused with tempera- 
mental quality, delight through qualities which 
are not always, it must be acknowledged, in- 
trinsically dramatic. The major situations of 
his plays seem scarcely worthy of the elabora- 
tion with which they are treated; and the 
characters seem not infrequently too thin to 
win our dignified attention. Even granting 
this, the plays have a curious sort of satiric 
effectiveness; and the characters, even when 
they do not excite our admiration, seldom fail 
to win our affectionate sympathy. The calcu- 
lating dexterity of the mother in " The Cassilis 
Engagement,'' with its mixture of mercilessness 
and pity, has the memorable, the classic timbre. 
However much our feelings may protest against 
the sacrifice of Stella Faringford, in "The 
Return of the Prodigal," we ungrudgingly 
acknowledge that Eustace is and can be only 
what he is: the invertebrate, of intellectual 
shrewdness and moral impotence, taking the 
easiest way literally because he is honest with 
himself in the admission that he cannot suc- 
cessfully achieve self-sacrifice. The most beau- 
tiful and profound of the plays the one 
'provocative of deepest reflection is " The 
Last of the De Mullins." The force and clar- 
ity of vision of Janet De Mullin are memorable 
and fortifying: we would love her if we but 
dared. The scene between Janet and her erst- 
while lover, in its economy and inevitability, 
is truly great only redeemed from the tragic 
through the vision and utter insight of the 
woman, compact of intuition without self-pity. 
The author of this play, had he lived, might 
have written one of the great dramas of the new 
century. ARCHIBALD HENDERSON. 



RECOLLECTIONS OF AN ACTIVE LIFE.* 

When a man so active and busy as our stren- 
uous ex- President snatches the time from other 
occupations to tell the story of his life, he is 
not likely to spend many hours in chewing the 
end of his pen-holder in search of apt phrases, 
elusive epithets, or the one supremely best word

that the professed stylist delights to run down 
and capture. Colonel Roosevelt's autobiography, 
which not unfittingly bears its writer's name as 
title, is thoroughly characteristic of the man; 
and the man himself is so well known to all the 
world that there would be something absurd as 
well as superfluous in offering a formal and 
extended review of the chapters wherein he re- 
hearses the already familiar account of his boy- 
hood, youth, early and later manhood, and the 
chief things he has accomplished in the great 
world of politics and public affairs. Parts of 
these chapters have already appeared in print, 
and much of the book as a whole has found 
expression, in one form or another, in some of 
the author's many utterances as writer and 
speaker. The vigor and directness for which 
he is justly admired show themselves in every 
sentence of his book; and if here and there a 
little more study of brevity or a little greater 
practice of restraint might have been desired, 
one must remember that it requires the leisure 
of the man of letters to achieve conciseness, and 
a modest reticence is incompatible with certain 
other qualities that have every right to demand 
recognition. 

With the exception of a few most welcome 
chapters of a personal or "intimate" character 
"Boyhood and Youth," "The Vigor of Life," 
"In Cowboy Land," and "Outdoors and 
Indoors" the narrative deals chiefly with pol- 
itics and policies as exemplified in the writer's 
public life and more or less connected with his 
administrative acts. Much of it is in the nature 
of an apologia, a word that might seem gro- 
tesquely inappropriate if put here in its English 
form. In defending, for example, his sending 
a telegram of sympathy to the widow of a prom- 
inent Pennsylvania politician, recently deceased, 
the author says : 

"A paper which constantly preached reform, and 
which kept up its circulation by the no less constant 
practice of slander, a paper which in theory condemned 
all public men who violated the eighth commandment, 
and in practice subsisted by incessant violation of the 
ninth, assailed me for sending my message to the dead 
man's wife. I knew the editors of this paper, and the 
editor who was their predecessor. They had led lives 
of bodily ease and the avoidance of bodily risk ; they 
earned their livelihood by the practice of mendacity 
for profit; and they delivered malignant judgment on 
a dead man who, whatever his faults, had in his youth 
freely risked his life for a great ideal, and who when 
death was already clutching his breast had spent almost 
his last breath on behalf of humble and friendless 
people whom he had served with disinterested loyalty." 

As was to have been expected, the piquantly 
personal and not always first-personal ele- 
ment is not lacking in the book. References

to a successor who "means well feebly" are 
sufficiently frequent and full, and are not 
counterbalanced by earlier and friendlier rem- 
iniscences of the same person in other walks of 
public life. But there is no need here to dwell 
on the disputatious portions of the book. Those 
who have a taste for the controversial in litera- 
ture will enjoy the chapters on "Practical 
Politics," "Applied Idealism," "The War of 
America the Unready," "The Presidency; 
Making an Old Party Progressive," and " The 
Big Stick and the Square Deal." Let us for 
the present cite a few illuminating passages of 
especial autobiographic interest, and then leave 
the rather bulky volume to those prepared to 
undertake the reading of it in its entirety. 
From the earlier pages dealing with the writer's 
education, the following is significant : 

" I thoroughly enjoyed Harvard, and 1 am sure it did 
me good, but only in the general effect, for there was 
very little in my actual studies which helped me in after 
life. More than one of my own sons have already prof- 
ited by their friendship with certain of their masters 
in school or college. I certainly profited by my friend- 
ship with one of my tutors, Mr. Cutler; and in Harvard 
I owed much to the professor of English, Mr. A. S. Hill. 
Doubtless through my own fault, I saw almost nothing 
of President Eliot and very little of the professors. I 
ought to have gained much more than I did gain from 
writing the themes and forensics. My failure to do so 
may have been partly due to my taking no interest in the 
subjects. Before I left Harvard I was already writing 
one or two chapters of a book I afterwards published 
on the Naval War of 1812. Those chapters were so 
dry that they would have made a dictionary seem light 
reading by comparison. Still, they represented purpose 
and serious interest on my part, not the perfunctory 
effort to do well enough to get a certain mark; and 
corrections of them by a skilled older man would have 
impressed me and have commanded my respectful 
attention." 

With no expectation of entering public life, the 
young collegian neglected elocution and took no 
part in debate; and though this was a loss in 
one way, in another the author considers it a 
gain. He was not called upon to make the 
worse appear the better cause, and he now feels 
convinced that the present method of conduct- 
ing college debates is injurious to the debaters. 
Only from conviction and in defense of principle 
would he have a young man make his voice heard 
in public argument. 

Here is a pleasing picture of family life, from 
a later period of the writer's history. It has a 
literary and an educational interest that warrants 
its reproduction : 

" There was also much training that came as a by- 
product and was perhaps almost as valuable not as a 
substitute but as an addition. After their supper the 
children, when little, would come trotting up to their 



mother's room to be read to, and it was always a sur- 
prise to me to notice the extremely varied reading which' 
interested them, from Howard Pyle's ' Robin Hood/ 
Mary Alice Owen's ' Voodoo Tales,' and Joel Chandler 
Harris's ' Aaron in the Wild Woods,' to ' Lycidas ' and 
' King John.' If their mother was absent, I would try 
to act as vice-mother a poor substitute, I fear super- 
intending the supper and reading aloud afterwards.' 
The children did not wish me to read the books they 
desired their mother to read, and I usually took some'; 
such book as ' Hereward the Wake,' or ' Guy Manner- 
ing,' or ' The Last of the Mohicans,' or else some story 
about a man-eating tiger, or a man-eating lion, from 
one of the hunting books in my library. These latter 
stories were always favorites, and as the authors told 
them in the first person, my interested auditors grew to 
know them by the name of the 'I' stories, and regarded 
them as adventures all of which happened to the same 
individual." 

Colonel Roosevelt has wisely omitted from 
his present volume the African hunting episode, 
as that has already been fully related; but 
there is abundant matter left, and a consider- 
able part of it has been relegated to fine-print 
appendices. There is also a wealth of graphic 
illustration, including many photographs and 
cartoons of especial interest. Emphatically and 
unmistakably the author has stamped himself 
on every page of his book, and no reader desir- 
ing a better acquaintance with him will be 
disappointed in this ample autobiography.

MR. ARNOLD BENNETT JN PARIS AND 
ELSEWHERE.* 



"I am an author of several sorts. I have 
various strings to my bow. And I know my 
business. I write half a million words a year." 
So, a decade ago, in an anonymous autobio- 
graphical skit, as entertaining a piece of work as 
he has ever turned out, declaimed Mr. Arnold 
Bennett. 

In the years that have passed since then, Mr. 
Bennett has acquired an international reputa- 
tion ; his knowledge of his business, if it could 
not widen, has deepened immeasurably ; but his 
indefatigable mental energy, his acute sensitive- 
ness to all the tones and tints that life can show 
him, his poignant pleasure in self-expression, 
have abated not one whit. He is still, from 
choice, " an author of several sorts." Thus, the 
youthful whimsicality of "The Grand Babylon 
Hotel'' has been matched in this present year 
of discreet middle-age by the amusing extrava- 
gances of "The Old Adam." And, because

THE D1AJL 



[Dec. 1 



many of his most interesting ideas and experi- 
ences cannot be utilized in a novel or staged in 
a play, Mr. Bennett still continues the practice 
of journalism. 

Glorified journalism it is, to be sure ; not the 
hard-driving monopoly of his best hours with 
which he began his literary adventure. Even 
to the most perfunctory of it, Mr. Bennett, out 
of his abounding energy, brings a zestf ul clever- 
ness that redeems it from commonplace. Those 
frankly manufactured reminiscences of his 
American tour, for instance, were picturesque 
and brilliant, though lacking in any depth of 
conviction. And in the best of his fugitive 
sketches, the pastels of London life, for 
example, that for some weeks, not long ago, 
constituted a series of particularly delightful 
columns in the London "Nation," Mr. Ben- 
nett shows the high gifts of subtle analysis, 
imaginative illumination, and critical irony 
that give distinction to his best work. 

About fifty of these occasional sketches, 
many very good and some decidedly mediocre, 
have been chosen from the output of some seven 
years, and gathered into a volume entitled 
" Paris Nights and Other Impressions of Places 
and People." It is a decidedly bulky volume ; 
large type and thick paper, and wide margins, 
with many illustrations, all casual and some 
very charming, by Mr. E. A. Rickards, make 
a setting somewhat too pretentious to suit the 
airy, unpretentious, unpremeditated notations 
to which Mr. Bennett was inspired by various 
contacts and experiences at home and abroad. 

Mr. Bennett's genius is unfailing in the 
matter of titles. " How to Live on Twenty- 
four Hours a Day" was suggestive enough to 
throw a glamour over the essential obviousness 
of some excellent ideas about the saving of 
time. " Clayhanger," again, vaguely connotes 
symbols and mysteries, investing an unprepos- 
sessing hero with a curious significance. And 
so "Paris Nights" evokes a thrill, hinting at 
passionate gaiety in high relief against sombre 
shadow ; at concentrated drama, swiftly played 
and cynically ended, only to be perpetually 
renewed ; at shining romance rubbing shoulders 
with sordid misery. " Paris Nights r " in short, 
may be paraphrased as a conventional designa- 
tion for life at its highest pitch. And it is 
exactly that of which Mr. Bennett writes ; only 
for him the special value, the titillating charm 
of life, lies largely in being able to pluck it in 
unexpected places, in dim recesses, in experi- 
ences that the average man accepts calmly as 
utterly banal and unmeaning. 



In Paris, for example, Mr. Bennett spends 
one of his significant evenings dining with a 
family of rich and stupid bourgeois. " Curious 
existence ! " is his final comment on their dull, 
contented, unthinking, perfectly ordered, ex- 
pensive round of living; and thus from their 
impossible self-satisfaction he extracts a certain 
characteristic interest. 

His " Artistic Evening " has all the elements 
with which he loves best to dally. 

" The first invitation I ever received into a purely 
Parisian interior might have been copied out of a novel 
by Paul Bourget. Its lure was thus phrased: 'Un pen de 
musique et d'agreablesfemmes.' It answered to my inward 
vision of Paris. My experiences in London, which 
fifteen years earlier I had entered with my mouth open 
as I might have entered some city of Oriental romance, 
had, of course, done little to destroy my illusions about 
Paris, for the ingenuousness of the artist is happily 
indestructible. Hence, my inward vision of Paris was 
romantic, based on the belief that Paris was essentially 
' different.' Nothing more banal in London than a 
1 little music,' or even ' some agreeable women'! But 
what a difference between a little music and un pen de 
musique! What an exciting difference between agree- 
able women and agreables femmes ! After all, this dif- 
ference remains nearly intact to this day." 

Such distinctions delight the indestructible 
ingenuousness of Mr. Bennett's artistic soul. 
Generally he contrives that they shall delight 
his readers. There is nothing recondite about 
this final analysis of the glitter of a great Lon- 
don restaurant; one has felt it all before in a 
way, but not articulately : 

" This is a fearful and romantic place. The romance 
of it rises grandiosely storey beyond storey. . . . And 
the most romantic and impressive thing about it all is 
the invisible secret thoughts, beneath the specious 
bravery, of the uncountable multitude gathered together 
under the spell of the brains that invented the organism. 
Can you not look through the transparent faces of the 
young men with fine waistcoats and neglected boots, and 
of the young women with concocted hats and insecure 
gay blouses, and of the waiters whose memories are full 
of Swiss mountains and Italian lakes and German beer 
gardens, and of the violinist who was proclaimed a 
Kubelik at the Conservatoire and who now is carelessly 
pronounced 'jolly good' by eaters of beefsteaks? Can 
you not look through and see the wonderful secret pre- 
occupations ? If so, you can also pierce walls and floors, 
and see clearly into the souls of the cooks and the sub- 
cooks, and the cellar-men, and the commissionaires in 
the rain, and the washers-up. They are all there, in- 
cluding the human beings with loves and ambitions who 
never do anything for ever and ever but wash up. . . . 
The place is grandiose and imposing; it has the dazzle 
of extreme success; but when you have stared it down 
it is wistful enough to make you cry." 

Swiss hotels and Florentine pensions, Italian 
opera, the roll of an Isle of Man steamboat, the 
superiority of Manchester, system-playing at 
Monte Carlo, the forest of Fontainebleau and 
its villages, the British home, the Russian ballet-

dancers, these give a fair indication of the 
variety of Mr. Bennett's inspiration. None of 
his impressions are profoundly important. Some- 
times the "indestructible ingenuousness of the 
artist" seems a bit over-done, degenerating into 
mere pose. But generally Mr. Bennett s com- 
ment is vivacious, provocative, alert to modern 
issues, investing the casual encounters of every- 
day living with that fresh interest and charm 
with which it is the function of the artist to 
supply them. EDITH KELLOGG DUNTON.

AMERICAN TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

Across the continent and back again the unre- 
luctant reader is carried by Mr. Robert Haven 
Schauffler in his volume entitled "Romantic Amer- 
ica" (Century Co.), a work that ''hopes to appeal 
alike to the traveler and the stay-at-home," and that 
" would persuade the young victim of Wanderlust to 
see America first, and the veteran wanderer to see 
America last." Successive scenes are thrown on the 
ample page of the royal octavo, from Provincetown at 
the tip end of Cape Cod to the missions of southern 
California, and from the Yosemite Valley and the 
Grand Canyon to the rugged shores of Maine, with 
passing glimpses of Old Virginia, of Pittsburgh 
("the city of beautiful smoke"), of Mammoth Cave 
and Yellowstone Park and the Creole city of New 
Orleans. Indeed, it is more than a glimpse that 
one gets of these different places. The writer's 
narrative and description are full and vivid, and the 
numerous full-page plates the work of such artists 
as Mr. Maxfield Parrish, Mr. Joseph Pennell, Mr. 
Harry Fenn, Mr. Winslow Homer, Mr. Andre* 
Castaigne, and Mr. George Inness ably second 
the author's endeavors to transport his readers to 
the scenes depicted. The frontispiece presents in 
different shades of orange and blue the Grand 
Canyon of the Colorado; while the other plates, 
each delicately tinted, show stretches of landscape, 
bits of city life, scenes of industrial activity, curious 
old buildings, seaside views, and so on, in rich variety 
and profusion. In both conception and execution 
the work is of no ordinary character. 

To study the Mackenzie River Eskimo in his 
native habitat and under conditions that would 
make the Eskimo unconscious of being studied was 
the happily fulfilled purpose of Mr. Vilhja"lmur 
Stef^nsson in his second Arctic expedition of 1908- 
12, in which the failure of the expedition's schooner 
to pick him up at Herschel Island, whither he had 
proceeded overland, left him, as he explains, " two 
hundred miles north of the polar circle, with a sum- 
mer suit of clothing, a camera, some notebooks, a 
rifle, and about two hundred rounds of ammunition, 
facing an Arctic winter, where my only shelter would 
have to be the roof of some hospitable Eskimo 



house." And these, he declares, were ideal condi- 
tions, and his loneliness and poverty constituted his 
greatest advantage. An exploring anthropologist 
of that temper of mind is likely to accomplish some- 
thing worth while and to contribute to the sum of 
human knowledge. Not only the Mackenzie River 
natives, but those of Victoria Island, remarkable for 
their blond complexions, and other tribes, were 
studied by Mr. Stefdnsson, whose book, "My Life 
with the Eskimo" (Macmillan), gives a full account 
of his strange experiences. A " Report on the Natu- 
ral History Collections of the Expedition," by Dr. 
Rudolph Martin Anderson, is added, with maps and 
an index. Numerous illustrations, chiefly from 
photographs, are also supplied. Though no north 
poles are encountered, the chronicle gives ample 
proof that other interesting things are not lacking 
in those distant latitudes. 

If one wishes to read about the beautiful Blue- 
ridge Mountains, the Appalachian National Park, 
which is now taking shape, the scenic attractions of 
Asheville and its neighborhood, the speech and pecu- 
liarities of the North Carolina mountaineers, the 
ways of the law-defying "moonshiner," the genesis 
of sorghum molasses, and other kindred matters of 
not exactly every-day familiarity, the book to read is 
Miss Margaret W. Morley's full and well-illustrated 
work on "The Carolina Mountains" (Houghton). 
Herself a resident of the region depicted, and of 
proved skill in writing about nature and the denizens 
of field and forest, Miss Morley shows herself thor- 
oughly at home in the scenes and among the primi- 
tive people she has chosen to describe. A veritable 
paradise, she assures us, opens before the visitor to 
this little-frequented part of our country. "As 
finally you approach the mountains that form the 
western end of North Carolina, you catch glimpses 
of heights so divinely blue that you seem about to 
enter some dream world through their magical 
portals." A water-color view of these mountains is 
supplied as frontispiece, and another appears on the 
cover; and a map is given at the end of the book. 
The many and good uncolored illustrations are from 
photographs taken by the author. 

Mr. Ernest Peixotto is well equipped for the pro- 
duction of such a book of travel and description 
and graphic illustration as "Pacific Shores from 
Panama" (Scribner). The approaching completion 
of the Panama Canal will open a way for winter 
tourists down the little-visited west coast of South 
America, and such books as this from Mr. Peix- 
otto's pen will become much more common than at 
present. Just now this volume is something of a 
pioneer in its field, and is sure to attract attention 
by its novelty, to say nothing of its other merits. 
Peru and its wonders as the ancient domain of the 
Incas, with a brief glimpse of Bolivia and some 
passing calls at points of interest in the northward 
voyage from Panama, furnish the substance of the 
volume. The author's well-known skill as an artist 
is exhibited in many an exquisite drawing to accom- 
pany the work of his pen. So much excellence of

more than one sort is seldom included within a 
single book of travel. A gorgeous but not inappro- 
priate cover-design distinguishes the volume. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson's manner of describing and 
photographically illustrating the highways and by- 
ways of various parts of our country is now so well 
and so favorably known as to make necessary only 
a brief notice of his latest achievement in this sort. 
" Highways and Byways from the St. Lawrence to 
Virginia" (Macmillan) is published as number six 
of the series, and conducts the reader through the 
states of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Virginia, and 
also into the District of Columbia, the Adirondack 
region being the nearest approach to the river named 
in the title. As in the other volumes of the series, 
local color, local idioms, local human nature, give 
life and variety to the successive chapters, and the 
illustrations are well chosen and of high quality. 

FOREIGN TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

Of a richness like that which distinguished his 
book on the Holy Land is Mr. Robert Hichens's 
sumptuous volume on "The Near East" (Century 
Co.), presenting in six leisurely chapters the chief 
attractions (to a seeker of the picturesque, the 
striking, the characteristic) of Dalmatia, Athens and 
the surrounding country, and Constantinople. The 
writer's descriptive powers are now well known, 
and are at their best in placing before the reader 
such matchless scenes as the view from the Acro- 
polis on a fair summer day, or in rendering with a 
few strokes the strange sights of the Turkish capi- 
tal. Of the first-named he says : " Very pure, very 
perfect, is this great view. Nature here seems 
purged of all excesses, and even nature in certain 
places can look almost theatrical, though never in 
Greece. The sea shines with gold, is decked with 
marvellous purple, glimmers afar with silver, fades 
into the color of shadow. The shapes of the moun- 
tains are as serene as the shapes of Greek statues." 
In a later stage of his eastern journey, and in 
another mood, he writes: "Pera has all that is 
odious of the Levant: impudence, ostentation, sly- 
ness, indelicacy, uproar, a glittering commonness. 
It is like a blazing ring of imitation diamonds 
squeezing a fat and dirty finger." Eighteen orien- 
tally brilliant paintings by Mr. Jules Gue*rin, with 
a much greater number of photographs, have con- 
tributed to the illustration of the book, which is a 
royal octavo in form, with beautiful print, wide 
margins, and handsome binding. 

One memorable Saturday afternoon, in the Mer- 
cantile Library, Baltimore, a lad of seventeen, look- 
ing up from his book, beheld the distinguished author 
of "Vanity Fair," and has ever since cherished the 
remembrance of that massive head and pink face, 
and those bespectacled eyes. The lad was F. Hop- 
kinson Smith, who now, many years later, reverts 
fondly to the occasion in his introduction to a series 
of illustrated chapters which bear the title, " In 



Thackeray's London " (Doubleday). With both pen 
and pencil he pictures some of the haunts frequented 
by the great novelist, choosing first of all those asso- 
ciated with Colonel Newcome, a prime favorite with 
Mr. Smith. Thus we have both an exterior and an 
interior view of the Colonel's rooms, and following 
these are glimpses of Grey Friars, Smithfield Market, 
Staple Inn, Berkeley Square, St. George's Church 
in Hanover Square, the Cock Tavern, Lamb Court, 
London Bridge, and so on, to the number of one-and- 
twenty excellent drawings accompanied by hardly 
less excellent chat on the themes they suggest. The 
volume is of quarto size, printed in large type, and 
durably bound in cloth. 

Mr. Howells's recent sight-seeing in Spain has 
furnished entertainment to readers of "Harper's 
Monthly," and his pleasant remembrances of that 
outing are now gathered into a volume entitled 
" Familiar Spanish Travels " (Harper) familiar 
because the ordinary tourist route seems to have 
been followed, with no side trips into the unknown. 
Thus the author's pen confines itself to picturing 
the things seen at Madrid, Toledo, Cordova, Seville, 
Valladolid, and other easily-accessible and often- 
visited places. But to view these scenes through 
Mr. Howells's eyes is a privilege to be prized by his 
readers. The genial philosophy of a mellow ma- 
turity pervades the book, and its pages reveal the 
author at his best. Of its many illustrations, some 
are the exquisite work of Mr. Norman Irving Black, 
and one of peculiar charm bears the signature of 
Mr. Walter Hale ; the others are from photographs. 
A pleasing and appropriate design adorns the cover, 
and an "Argument" in verse, from Mr. Howells's 
pen, is printed on the wrapper. 

Miss Lilian Whiting's "Athens the Violet- 
Crowned" (Little, Brown & Co.) is written in that 
pleasing manner which has won so many readers 
for her score or more of other books, from "The 
World Beautiful" to her study of the Brownings. 
Sensitiveness to beauty, and a faculty for discover- 
ing it in the things about her, give her writings a 
bright and cheerful and optimistic tone that renders 
them not inappropriate as Christmas gifts and not 
unsuited to Christmas reading. Her present volume 
is especially enjoyable and informing in its descrip- 
tion of things seen by the writer herself in the 
Athens of to-day, though passages on the older 
Athens are not lacking. An account of the archae- 
ological schools established at different times in the 
Greek capital, and a short chapter on contemporary 
Greek literature, contain in brief space some facts 
of interest. Her treatment of the literature and 
arts of ancient Greece is necessarily of a cursory 
nature. A short chapter on "Ethical Poetry of 
Greece" contains fragments from noteworthy En- 
glish versions of Greek poets, and in her running 
comment Miss Whiting takes occasion to inform 
her readers that "the traditional counsel to 'Count 
no man happy till he dies,' is condensed from a 
passage in the (Ediptis Tyrannus" a translation of

which is added. Has she forgotten Solon's famous 
reply to Croasus, long before Sophocles was born? 
The book is well and profusely illustrated from 
photographs. 

" On the first day of May, 1911, we began our 
exploration of the ' Scott Country.' I say we, be- 
cause I was accompanied by the companion of a 
much longer journey, of which that year was the 
twenty-fifth milestone." Thus begins " The Country 
of Sir Walter Scott" (Houghton), by Mr. Charles 
S. Olcott, who three years ago gave us a good book 
on the scenes and characters of George Eliot's novels. 
After an introduction and a biographical chapter, 
the author takes up Scott's chief works in the order 
of their writing, and brings together the pertinent 
facts of geography and history, with other and more 
personal items of interest, adding also a great num- 
ber of fine full-page views of historic scenes and 
beautiful landscapes from his own camera. The 
Raeburn portrait of Scott serves as frontispiece. 
With a final chapter entitled " A Successful Life," 
and a full index, the book comes to an end. 

The tone and spirit of Mr. Oliver Huckel's 
" Through England with Tennyson " (Crowell) 
distinguish it from most travel books of its kind, in 
that the journey in this instance seems not to have 
been undertaken primarily for book-making purposes, 
but out of an earnest desire to see the places once 
so familiar to the traveller's favorite poet, and to 
tread the ground once pressed by that poet's foot. 
Mr. HuckePs descriptions of Tennyson's haunts and 
homes, in Lincolnshire, in the Isle of Wight, and 
among the Surrey hills, are agreeably interspersed 
with anecdote, reminiscence, quotation, and ever and 
anon a glimpse of his travelling companions, the 
Lady and the Laddies, and of the incidental hap- 
penings by the way. A map and numerous views 
and portraits, with a list of Tennysonian poems con- 
nected with the places visited, and a concluding 
index, round out this attractive and instructive 
volume. 

Subjects in plenty for historical research and 
for readable description have been found by Miss 
Ella Noyes in the rolling plain about Salisbury, 
in the famous cathedral of that city, in the city 
itself, in the stones that propound their riddle to 
every visitor to Stonehenge, in Old Sarum and 
Wilton and Wileybourn, in the Avon valley, the 
roads that traverse the plain and the villages that 
sprinkle it. "Salisbury Plain : Its Stones, Cathedral, 
City, Villages, and Folk" (Button) presents the 
results of long and loving study on the part of one 
who evidently knows every nook and corner of the 
region dealt with, knows its history and legends, 
its people and its customs, its natural beauties and 
its features of interest due to the hand of man. 
Miss Dora Noyes has illustrated the book with deli- 
cately pleasing colored drawings and equally grace- 
ful line sketches both in abundance, and of more 
than ordinary artistic merit. Literary and historic 
associations make the region, and hence the book, 
memorable to every intelligent reader. 



"A Stained Glass Tour in Italy" (Lane), by Mr. 
Charles Hitchcock Sherrill, enjoys the advantage 
of having a title rather out of the ordinary, and the 
kind of promenade on which it takes the reader is 
not exactly of an every-day sort. The beauties of 
stained glass windows are studied in successive 
Italian cities, Rome, Orvieto, Perugia, Assisi, and 
so on, to Milan and Pavia, not omitting Florence 
and Pisa and Siena and Venice. Illustrations in 
plenty help out the verbal descriptions, but no 
attempt has been made to reproduce in color the 
glories that inspire the writer's pen perhaps 
because such attempt was sure to disappoint. The 
technicalities of the subject are but cursorily 
treated, as the book is evidently intended for gen- 
eral reading, as are the same author's similar works 
relating to France and England. 

Forest-lovers will enjoy Mr. Arthur 0. Cooke's 
fine volume, " The Forest of Dean " (Dutton), with 
its graphic descriptions of things to be seen in the 
great Crown woodland lying between the Severn 
and the Wye in Gloucestershire, and also of other 
scenically or historically noteworthy places that were 
formerly within the limits of the Forest, but now 
outside. Walks and talks with the foresters are 
agreeably reported, a multitude of matters relating 
to forestry, to local history, to the people and the 
industries of the region, are mentioned in passing, 
and every now and then a pencil sketch or a colored 
drawing is introduced to give point and fuller mean- 
ing to the narrative or description. If the reader 
wishes additional information as to the Forest's 
history, he is referred to H. G. Nicholls's " Historical 
and Descriptive Account," published half a century 
ago. 

An amusing preface in the form of an imaginary 
conversation between publisher and author explains 
the plan and purpose of Mr. Frankfort Somerville's 
book, "The Spirit of Paris" (Macmillan). The 
author attempts to seize and embody in his pages 
something of the je ne sais quoi that makes the 
French capital so irresistibly fascinating to all the 
world. Description, narrative, dialogue, anecdote, 
and, not least of all, colored drawings by Messrs. 
Fraipont, Gautier, Kirchner, and others, contribute 
in their several ways to the production of some such 
effect as an actual visit to Paris and a mingling 
with its light-hearted, pleasure-loving, quick-witted 
populace might produce. Parisian amusements, 
costume, cooking, Parisian theatres, fgtes, cafe's, the 
races, the artists, the typical Parisienne, Americans 
in Paris, with much beside, give liveliness and 
variety to Mr. Somerville's chapters. Some of the 
colored drawings are remarkably good, others not so 
good, but all in accord with " the spirit of Paris." 

With a camera, a motor-car (even a hired one), 
and a fairly abundant supply of ready money, one 
can in a few days of assiduous touring collect mate- 
rial for an entertaining and plentifully illustrated 
book of travel. " Old Countries Discovered Anew " 
(Estes) gives in bright and rather novel form Mr. 
Ernest Talbert's experiences in a family flight by

automobile through parts of Holland, Germany, and 
France, in a few weeks of early summer. Many 
curious and little-frequented scenes were visited, 
local history and photographed views were gathered 
for the prospective volume, and on the whole a 
rollicking good time seems to have been enjoyed. 
Much useful information for future auto-tourists is 
furnished, with earnest advice to hire rather than 
transport over-seas the needed automobile. A map, 
appendix, special index of practical matters, gen- 
eral index, and seventy-one illustrations, including 
a colored frontispiece, are a part of the book's 
handsome equipment. 

Mr. Henry C. Shelley's assiduous pen gives us a 
small and useful volume on "Shakespeare and 
Stratford" (Little, Brown & Co.), which points out 
agreeably and with sufficient erudition the places of 
Shakespearean interest in the Warwickshire town, 
and presents them to the eye in illustrations from 
photographs taken by the author. In connection 
with the so-called birthplace of the poet, the reader 
is duly advised of the serious doubt as to its being 
really the birthplace, and of the claims of the so- 
called Brook House, no longer standing, to the honor 
in question. Chapters on New Place, on the Strat- 
ford church, the town, and the eight neighboring 
hamlets known as the Shakespeare villages, make 
up, with a few pages of notes for tourists, the rest 
of the book. 

A new edition of Mr. W. J. Loftie's excellent 
historical and descriptive account of Westminster 
Abbey is offered through the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
In addition to the colored frontispiece, the repro- 
ductions of old prints, and the illustrations from 
photographs, there are many fine drawings of espe- 
cially interesting parts of the Abbey from the 
skilled hand of Mr. Herbert Bailton. A fuller 
index might have been made for the book's three 
hundred and sixteen compact pages of varied infor- 
mation, instead of the meagre performance that 
now completes the book. Mr. Loftie's chapters 
on the monuments, the epitaphs, and the heraldry 
of the Abbey, as also that on the Poet's Corner, 
and that on royal coronations, make the work both 
useful to the tourist and interesting to the arm- 
chair reader. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

Like each of his four previous volumes from 
Thoreau's works, Mr. Clifton Johnson's edition of 
sundry selections grouped under the title "Excur- 
sions" (Crowell) has thirty-three illustrations from 
his camera, chiefly views taken here and there in 
the Thoreau country, as we may call Concord and 
the neighborhood most frequented by the naturalist. 
Emerson's biographical sketch of his famous fellow- 
townsman opens the book, and is followed by 
Thoreau's notes on certain Massachusetts natural- 
history reports that appeared about 1842, his 
description of a walk to Mt. Wachusett, his short 
paper on "The Landlord," another describing a 



winter walk, his address before the Middlesex Agri- 
cultural Society on "The Succession of Forest 
Trees," considerable passages of his in praise of 
walking, others relating to the splendors of autumn 
foliage, his well-known chapter on wild apples, and, 
finally, some observations on night and moonlight. 
Indication of the exact source of these selections is 
often wanting ; also, the pictures, beautiful and gen- 
erally appropriate as they are, have seldom a close 
connection with the reading matter. Nevertheless 
it is a well-planned, well-executed, and very attract- 
ive book, beautifully bound and suitably boxed. 

New books of travel appear and disappear, but 
Kinglake's "Eothen," first published sixty-nine years 
ago, reappears in edition after edition, usually with 
a diminishing interval between each later edition and 
its successor. In England alone, nineteen editions 
had been issued between 1844 and 1910, and the 
twentieth, which makes its appeal to American pur- 
chasers through the J. B. Lippincott Co., is now on 
the market. An appreciative introduction by Mr. 
S. L. Bensusan prefaces the book, and some gor- 
geously oriental colored plates, by Mr. Frank 
Brangwyn, with smaller drawings from the same 
hand as chapter-headings, enliven its pages. King- 
lake was a pioneer in eastern travel, and his braving 
of its dangers and hardships was no train-de-luxe 
or motor-car tour. That journey of his into the 
unknown Near East of 1835 was an adventure well 
worth recording ; and the record will live. 

The yearly reprints from Jefferies and Gilbert 
White and Thoreau attest the unfailing interest of 
the reading public in those gifted interpreters of 
nature. "The Story of My Heart," that wonderful 
mingling of spiritual autobiography and impassioned 
nature-study and wide-ranging speculation, appears 
this year in a new and fitting dress, with eight beau- 
tifully drawn and almost as satisfactorily colored 
illustrations by E. W. Waite. The letters from 
Jefferies to Longman, his publisher, leading up to 
the publication of the book, also his analysis of the 
work as given in the publisher's "Notes on Books" 
of November 30, 1883, are prefixed to the present 
edition, together with an anonymous " foreword " of 
the briefest sort. In all the particulars of its form 
and appearance, this reissue of a favorite classic is 
everything that could be desired. A box protects the 
book's ornamental binding. (E. P. Button & Co.) 

" The Jungle Book " seems to be the most endur- 
ingly popular, or one might say the most increasingly 
popular, of Mr. Kipling's works, with young readers, 
as well as many older ones ; and its circulation will 
be further enlarged by this season's issue of an edition 
having sixteen full-page illustrations of tropical lux- 
uriance in their color-effects, designed by Messrs. 
Maurice and Edward Detmold. Uncolored drawings 
introduce the several chapters, and each page is 
bordered with representations of jungle foliage in 
light green. Similar decorations adorn the end 
leaves, and a cover design in gold and three shades 
of green presents in still another form the beauty

and charm of the jungle. A splendid setting is this 
for the fortunes of Mowgli and his four-footed 
friends. (Century Co.) 

So good a story as " Tom Brown's School Days " 
can well bear occasional re-issuing. A handsome 
edition, furnished with interesting historical and 
biographical comment, and provided with illustra- 
tions from various sources, including, of course, 
portraits of Thomas Hughes and Dr. Arnold, takes 
its place among the more important reprints of the 
season. Lord Kilbracken, an old Rugbeian, con- 
tributes a short preface, and Mr. F. Sidgwick writes 
an extended introduction. Both the camera and 
the pencil furnish illustrations in profusion, and the 
cover-design shows a view of the school buildings. 
It is indeed an elaborate and tasteful form that the 
famous story now assumes. (G. P. Putnam's Sons.) 

In a rich volume of spacious dimensions and 
bearing the title, "Tales from Washington Irving's 
Traveller" (Lippincott), are gathered a baker's 
dozen of the immortal stories of " Geoffrey Crayon," 
with nearly as many large colored plates, the work 
of Mr. George Hood. Typography, paper, and 
binding are all in harmony with the general design 
of the book, and the vivid and variegated hues of 
the illustrations also accord not badly with the spirit 
of romance pervading the volume. The work will 
commend itself to lovers of what is striking and at 
the same time not too gaudy in book-manufacture. 

The striking illustrations, oriental in their rich 
coloring, which made Mr. Willy Pog^ny's edition 
of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat a memorable work a 
few years ago, are all reproduced without change 
in the less expensive reprint of the book now 
offered by its publishers (Crowell Co.) and certainly 
worthy of a large sale. The version is of course 
FitzGerald's, in which one is glad to see the earlier 
and more admirable opening, " Awake ! for morning 
in the bowl of night," etc. Tinted paper, graceful 
border-designs, a text imitating in general appear- 
ance the Persian original (not the Arabic, as the 
publishers announce), a beautiful binding, and, above 
all, the twenty-four full-page illustrations, combine 
to make this an artistically satisfying edition. 

Two tasteful volumes in white covers of parch- 
ment-like appearance, delicately ornamented, are 
devoted to the more pleasing of Shakespeare's songs, 
sixteen in number, and to a selection (fifteen) from 
the sonnets. Ornamental text, illuminated initials 
and borders and vignettes are the handiwork of 
Miss Edith A. Ibbs. Each page is a separate work 
of art ; there are no repeated designs, and the whole 
effect is most pleasing. As gifts to and from per- 
sons of discrimination, these little books will be 
appreciated. (Dutton.) 

HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

Bringing to his task a devout and appreciative 
spirit, the late John La Farge executed a remark- 
able piece of work in "The Gospel Story in Art" 
(Macmillan), the final product of his genius, and one 
that he had planned many years before it was act- 



ually carried through. Born and reared in the older 
faith of Christendom, as we are reminded by the 
author's close friend who prefaces the book, Mr. 
La Farge was in thorough sympathy with his sub- 
ject, and also, of course, amply equipped with the 
technical knowledge necessary for its satisfactory 
treatment. Beginning with characters and events 
antedating the gospel story, he weaves his discourse 
about the great works of sacred art, from Raphael's 
" Heliodorus " to Bordone's" Pentecost, "with repro- 
ductions of these masterpieces to the number of 
eighty, in full-page plates, delicately tinted. A few 
last touches have been given to the work by the 
editor, but virtually it is all as the author himself 
left it when death stayed his hand. The narrative 
and comment make nineteen chapters, which fill 
more than four hundred quarto pages. An illu- 
minated design of great beauty adorns the cover, 
and the book is suitably boxed. A more acceptable 
Christmas gift to one qualified to appreciate it could 
not easily be imagined. 

Evolution in household furniture during the first 
two centuries of American history becomes a fasci- 
nating study as treated by Mr. Luke Vincent Lock- 
wood in his "Colonial Furniture in America" 
(Scribner), which now, eleven years after its first 
appearance, is expanded into two massive quarto 
volumes with eight hundred and sixty-seven illus- 
trations of representative pieces. In fact, so much 
new material has been discovered by the author 
that he has felt it necessary to rewrite his book 
throughout, so that the much enlarged work is now 
virtually a new treatise, and its several chapters as 
exhaustive as they could well be made without be- 
coming too technical for general interest. After 
an introductory sketch of the origin and character 
of our early furniture, the author begins the body of 
his work with chapters on chests and chests of 
drawers, passing in logical sequence to cupboards 
and sideboards, thence to desks and writing-tables, 
and closing his first volume with looking-glasses. 
Volume two treats of chairs, settees, couches, and 
sofas, tables, bedsteads, and clocks. How the rude 
pine chest mounts through all the spires of form to 
the carved mahogany dressing-table of exquisite 
Chippendale design, and how the severely plain 
settle becomes elaborated into the gracefully orna- 
mented settee and the luxurious couch, may be 
traced in Mr. Lockwood's graphic pages with their 
lavish accompaniment of excellent half-tones. The 
ideal that at last successfully got itself realized was 
the production of furniture combining a minimum 
of material with a maximum of grace, and at the 
same time having due regard to strength and ser- 
viceability. The attainment of this ideal coincides 
pretty nearly with the close of our colonial period, 
so that the study of colonial furniture has a certain 
completeness in itself that gives an added satisfac- 
tion to its pursuit. Incidentally there is much politi- 
cal and religious history to be read in the lines of 
an old rush-bottomed chair or oak bedstead or 
grandfather's clock. The Plymouth settlers' years

of residence in Holland were attested in such 
simple articles of furniture as they brought with 
them to the New World, and the Puritan emigrants 
from the west of England also carried with them 
similar evidences of their former place of habita- 
tion and more prosperous mode of life. Indeed, it 
is in New England that the author has found the 
most abundant and the most interesting examples 
of early furniture, while the South, he says, " is 
wof ully lacking in any pieces prior to the mahogany 
period, although the inventories show that such 
pieces existed more abundantly there even than in 
the North." The causes of this dearth might not 
be very difficult to trace. In preparing his work, 
Mr. Lockwood seems to have ransacked most of 
the available sources of information, examined 
the principal collections, and pushed his researches 
wherever there was promise of a valuable discovery. 
An owner's unwillingness to let photographs be 
taken of his treasures has sometimes balked him in 
part, but the result of his labors is, on the whole, 
highly satisfactory. 

Mr. Seymour de Ricci's study of "Louis XVI. 
Furniture" (Putnam) is a quarto of sumptuous 
appearance, comprising chiefly full-page plates and 
smaller illustrations, picturing the grace and charm 
of the tables, chairs, mantel-pieces, bedsteads, 
mural carving, and so on, that are associated with 
the name of the monarch whose reign came to so 
dire an end with the outbreak of the French Revo- 
lution. A short account of the origin and rise of 
the Louis Seize style precedes the rich collection of 
photographic representations of typical examples, 
and in the course of this brief treatise the author 
maintains that the culmination of the style was 
reached considerably earlier than is commonly sup- 
posed, or at about the close of the reign of Louis 
XV. The illustrations, covering two hundred and 
fifty-six large pages, furnish a feast to the eye of 
him who loves beauty of form and wealth of orna- 
mentation in the appointments of a room. Such 
rich collections as those of the Musde des Arts 
Decoratifs, Paris, and the Kunstgewerbe-Museum, 
Berlin, as well as many private collections, have 
been drawn upon for typical examples. Art stu- 
dents and collectors will find the book of great 
value, and hardly anyone can turn its pages without 
enjoyment and instruction. 

NATURE AND OUT-DOOR LIFE. 
Fourteen papers, "written in many moods, and 
in many places, during the past half-dozen years," 
and originally published in various magazines, are 
collected by Mr. Walter Prichard Eaton in a vol- 
ume entitled "Barn Doors and Byways" (Small, 
Maynard & Co.), which with deft strokes of pen 
and pencil and brush opens to view a variety of 
scenes chiefly in rural New England, with a few 
Southern vistas to mark a contrast. Two papers 
one on "Wild Life in New York" (city, not state), 
and the other entitled " Washington Square : A 
Meditation" are of a slightly urban character, 



though even here the things seen are things sugges- 
tive of the country. For example: "The spring 
hats this year are wonderful affairs an acre sown 
with flowers. Beyond the fountain one of the green 
'busses rolled by, its top loaded with sight-seers, 
and the hats of the women made it a gay garden in 
transit down the Avenue." Even the sky-scrapers 
suggest mountain scenery and are spoken of as an 
"Andean pile." Tasteful full-page plates in tint, 
with smaller black-and-white drawings as decorative 
headings to the successive chapters, are supplied by 
Mr. Walter King Stone. 

Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton has long ago proved 
that he can see with his eyes and draw with his 
hand and reason with his brain. In his "Wild 
Animals at Home" (Doubleday) there is much 
sketching and photographing of untamed creatures 
in their native haunts, and admirable discourse con- 
cerning them. In the Yellowstone Park and else- 
where in the great West the author has carried on 
the nature-studies now reduced to writing and pre- 
sented in twelve enjoyable chapters with a wealth 
of illustrations. The coyote, the prairie-dog, the 
famous fur-bearers, the swift runners, the squirrel 
and the rabbit, and other wild animals, are inti- 
mately interviewed by this skilled reporter of the 
forest and the field ; and what he has to say, com- 
bined with his manner of saying it, is not likely to 
disappoint. Humor of a choice kind speaks in both 
the printed page and in the accompanying marginal 
sketches, while the half-tone plates have the soberer 
excellences of such products of the illustrator's art. 
Human nature is not neglected in the author's stud- 
ies; animals were not the sole living beings he en- 
countered. Mrs. Seton furnishes an original and 
appropriate cover design, and has otherwise assisted 
in the preparation of the book. 

It is evident that no expense has been spared in 
the preparation of Mr. H. Inigo Triggs's " Garden 
Craft in Europe" (Scribner), a handsome quarto 
abounding in reproductions of old engravings, paint- 
ings, illuminations, and of photographs from nature. 
Having published ten years ago a work on " Formal 
Gardens in England and Scotland," Mr. Triggs here 
confines his attention chiefly to the Continent, and 
especially to France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, 
and the Netherlands. Russia and Scandinavia have 
not greatly distinguished themselves in landscape 
gardening. After two necessarily short chapters on 
ancient and mediaeval gardens, the author lavishes 
his resources on the garden craft of the sixteenth, 
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Le Notre 
and the triumphs of his art at Versailles naturally 
claim extended notice, and it is Le N6tre's portrait 
that serves as appropriate frontispiece to the volume. 
The final chapter deals with "The English Land- 
scape School and its Influence on the Continent." 
A ten-page bibliography gives a list of nearly two 
hundred and forty special works on garden design, 
and a full index to text and illustrations closes the 
volume.

THE DIAL

Mr. David Grayson, fearing that his farm and 
his live-stock and the rest of his worldly possessions 
were beginning to own him, rather than to be owned 
by him, broke loose from them one day and ran 
away, or walked away, out over the inviting ribbon 
of road that stretched alluringly into the romantic un- 
known. The story of his adventures is told by him 
in a book called "The Friendly Road" (Doubleday). 
As a dusty pedestrian, and often regarded as not 
much better than a tramp, the author met with 
sundry experiences of suggestiveness and value, the 
result, he says, of "coming up to life from under- 
neath ; of being taken for less than I am rather than 
for more than I am." This was refreshing after those 
long and weary earlier years of trying to keep in 
proper position a sort of dummy that he had set up 
and striven to make appear as he imagined the man 
bearing his name ought to appear in the eyes of the 
world. As in his "Adventures in Contentment" 
and "Adventures in Friendship," the writer here 
comes close to the real things and the only things 
that matter in life. " New Adventures in Content- 
ment" is the book's appropriate sub-title. Mr. 
Thomas Fogarty illustrates it well and generously, 
both in color and in black-and-white. 

A set of strikingly beautiful views of Williams- 
town, Massachusetts, and its surroundings, not 
omitting the more important college buildings, 
serves as a fitting frame for a half-dozen nature 
poems by Professor George Lansing Raymond, 
introduced by an appreciative preface from the pen 
of Dr. Marion Mills Miller. "The Mountains 
about Williamstown " is the book's title, and Grey- 
lock, West Mountain, and Berlin Mountain are 
especially celebrated in the poems. Ford's Glen 
gives its name to another, while the remaining two 
are entitled "A Woodland Reverie" and "Amid 
the Mountains." They are all in ten-syllable verse, 
usually unrhymed, and hence a little monotonous in 
effect, though full of high feeling. The thirty-three 
full-page plates are excellent, and the scenes they 
represent well chosen by the poet and his assistants 
at the camera. (G. P. Putnam's Sons.) 

In "The Four Seasons " (Dodd), a poetic apologue 
by Herr Carl Ewald, translated by Mr. Alexander 
Teixeira de Mattos, the seasons are represented as 
great and powerful princes who divide the year 
among themselves and then proceed to exhibit their 
prowess and might, each in characteristic fashion, 
with birds and beasts and plants and trees as minor 
characters in the wonderful drama. Frequent songs, 
turned into English by Mr. Osman Edwards, give 
pleasing variety to the story, and the whole is taste- 
fully printed with decorative page-borders and a 
suitable frontispiece. 

RECORDS OF THE PAST. 

In "The Story of Harvard" (Little, Brown & 
Co.) is presented a conveniently succinct account 
of our oldest university by one of her graduates, 
Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier, of the class of 1895. 
Those who have read Mr. Pier's early novel, that 



vivid and amusing story of the Harvard Summer 
School, "The Pedagogues," will be prepared to 
find him handling with a light touch and a pleasant 
humor certain aspects of Harvard history and Har- 
vard life. Notably do these graces of style blossom 
forth in his opening chapter, wherein are depicted 
the experiences and sensations of a graduate of 
twenty years ago upon revisiting his old haunts, 
now so changed, and in the closing chapter, which 
is entitled "Freshman and Senior." In the body 
of the book are gathered the main facts of Har- 
vard's history, drawn largely from such standard 
authorities as Peirce and Quincy and Peabody, 
with occasional suggestions and quotations from 
other sources, to all of whom indebtedness is duly 
acknowledged. Mr. Vernon Howe Bailey has made 
sixteen pencil drawings, pleasing and appropriate, 
to accompany the reading matter, and both binding 
and box are embellished with the depiction of a 
familiar Harvard building. 

The hackneyed term, a " human document," will 
suggest itself to readers of "A Woman Rice 
Planter" (Macmillan) as the best brief description 
of the vivid though quiet and unpretending pages 
of that remarkable narrative. Mrs. Patience Pen- 
nington tells in the form of a diary the story of 
her struggle to carry on a large rice plantation on 
the South Carolina coast, a struggle heroic in its 
nature, though so simply and modestly and un-self- 
consciously narrated that a careless reader would 
never suspect half of what is to be read between the 
lines. Death and other misfortunes had left on her 
shoulders a burden such as a strong man might 
have sunk beneath; and the courage and spirit, as 
well as the quiet humor and infinite patience and self- 
control, revealed in her pages, are qualities beyond 
a hurried reviewer's powers to do justice to. Mr. 
Owen Wister introduces the book with a few para- 
graphs of cordial commendation, and a sympathetic 
artist illustrates it with drawings redolent of the 
South. The previous serial appearance of the work 
in the New York "Sun " is a voucher, if such were 
needed, for its readable quality. 

As is remarked in the preface to "The Romance 
of the American Theatre" (Little, Brown & Co.), 
by Miss Mary Caroline Crawford, there exists no 
complete history of the stage in this country, though 
scores of pens have written entertainingly about it. 
To these scattered chapters Miss Crawford makes a 
notable contribution in her ample sheaf of memo- 
ries gleaned from many sources and extending from 
Nance Oldfield and Peg Woffington (whose connec- 
tion with the American theatre is certainly not 
close) to Miss Marlowe and Mrs. Fiske and Mr. John 
Drew and other stars of the present-day stage. 
Among themes of interest are her observations on 
the ups and downs of the theatre in the South, her 
account of Edwin Forrest as actor and man, her 
passages devoted to Booth and his immediate con- 
temporaries, and her concluding remarks on the 
theatre of New York and the drama of to-day. The 
book shows diligence in compilation and skill in

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1 



arrangement of material, with evident intent to 
be broadly and generously inclusive. But among 
things perhaps unavoidably omitted one notes with 
some surprise that, good Bostonian though she is, 
Miss Crawford has barely mentioned that favorite 
comedian of Boston play-goers of half a century 
ago, William Warren, while other names are looked 
for quite in vain. The book is generously and 
suitably illustrated, handsomely bound, and neatly 
boxed. 

Between the dandy with a leaning toward letters 
and the man of letters with a leaning toward dandy- 
ism there are many grades, representing varying 
proportions of the two ingredients of foppery and 
devotion to literature. Some typical examples of 
more or less literate men of fashion and more or less 
fashionable men of letters are presented in rapid 
and dexterous portraiture by Mr. Leon H. Vincent 
in his "Dandies and Men of Letters" (Houghton), 
which contains a dozen chapters on as many celeb- 
rities of the early nineteenth century in England. 
Beau Brummel naturally leads the list, followed 
by Count D'Orsay, Lord Byron, Samuel Rogers, 
Thomas Moore, Thomas Hope, William Beckford, 
Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, 
Benjamin Disraeli, Bulwer-Lytton, and Henry 
Crabb Robinson. Portraits of these gentlemen 
illustrate the book, which is of that informal, inti- 
mate, anecdotal sort that seldom fails to entertain. 
A resplendent binding is appropriately provided for 
these followers of fashion. 

A vast store of facts interesting to those who 
follow the progress of ship-building is contained in 
Mr. E. Keble Chatterton's "Ships and Ways of 
Other Days" (Lippincott), a book setting forth in 
a baker's dozen of ample chapters, aided by one 
hundred and thirty illustrations of various kinds, 
the eventful story, "how men managed to build, 
launch, equip, and fit out different craft in all ages," 
from the time of the Phoenicians to the last quarter 
of the nineteenth century. The iron or steel steam- 
ship, or "tea-kettle" as the old-time sailor contempt- 
uously styled it, has no place in Mr. Chatterton's 
pages. As already shown in his "Sailing Ships and 
their Story" and in his "Fore and Aft," his love 
is not for the ocean greyhound or the modern fight- 
ing craft. In his chosen field he writes with full 
knowledge and with experienced pen. 

HOLIDAY FICTION. 

An ingeniously constructed little romance, brisk, 
eventful, dramatic, and with a capital climax most 
happily led up to, comes from the pen of Mr. Jeffery 
Farnol in a dainty volume with colored pictures by 
Mr. Charles E. Brock, and entitled "The Honour- 
able Mr. Tawnish" (Little, Brown & Co.). The 
time of the action is in that indefinite past when 
wigs and ruffles and laced coats were in fashion, as 
also were duelling and gambling and hard drinking ; 
and the story is enlivened with plenty of adventure, 
with highway robbery and dexterous play of swords 
and some letting of blood, with a love affair to bind 



everything together within the limits prescribed by 
the dramatic unities. The hero, who first poses as 
a fop, turns out to be a gallant and fearless gentle- 
man, and all ends happily with his winning of the 
heroine and rescue of her father from certain death 
at the hands of the villain. Mr. Farnol here shows 
himself at his least prolix and, some will say, his 
best. 

This season's love-story from the pen of Mr. Ralph 
Henry Barbour has the alluring title of "Lady 
Laughter" (Lippincott), and relates how Richard 
Hollidge, Harvard graduate and formerly Harvard 
instructor in English, thought himself to be hard at 
work on his forthcoming textbook on "The Princi- 
ples of Good English, for the Use of Schools and 
Colleges," while in reality he was falling more and 
more irretrievably in love with his second cousin, 
Betty Lee, the Lady Laughter of the little romance, 
which of course ends happily with declarations of 
undying attachment on both sides and the prospect 
of wedding bells and orange blossoms iu the near 
future. This story of the preoccupied scholar who 
has to be helped into a consciousness of the state 
of his heart, and then requires what is virtually a 
proposal from her who has caused all the mischief, 
is older than the Pyramids, but always a favorite. 
Good colored pictures and graceful decorations 
embellish Mr. Barbour's inviting volume, which is 
ornately bound and boxed. 

In a beautiful holiday edition, with sixteen 
brightly-colored illustrations from the brush of Mr. 
Frederick S. Coburn, Miss Anna Fuller's idyl, "A 
Venetian June" (Putnam), makes its appearance in 
the twenty-third printing since first it delighted its 
readers seventeen years ago. Venice forms a pleas- 
ing setting for tale or romance, as has been proved 
often enough ; and with the resources of art and fine 
book-making placed at her disposal, Miss Fuller can- 
not complain of any sombreness in the dress that now 
clothes her graceful work. Venice is a city of color, 
and even if Mr. Coburn's tints are perhaps rather 
gaudy as is likely to be the case at present in all 
colored illustrations the general effect is cheerful 
and festive, or, in other words, appropriate to the 
season. 

"The Valley of Shadows " (Lane), by Mr. Francis 
Grierson, appears in a new edition with good illus- 
trations in color by Miss Evelyn Paul. The Grier- 
son family removed to Illinois, from England, not 
long before the outbreak of our Civil War, and the 
boy Francis received indelible impressions of prairie 
life and prairie folk, which are realistically repro- 
duced in his book. He heard Lincoln and Douglas 
in one of their famous debates, he acted as page to 
General Fre'mont just after Frdmont had succeeded 
General Harney as military commander in St. Louis, 
and he had an older cousin in Grant's army who 
made the family name illustrious by his daring 
cavalry raids. His abundant material for the fur- 
nishing of a good book has been skilfully handled 
by the author in the narrative that has already made 
him favorably known to many readers.

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

The story of "Parsifal" this year receives the 
benefit of Mr. T. W. Rolleston's interpretative skill 
in a poetic version of beauty and charm. He will 
be remembered as the author of a notable rendering 
of the "Tannhauser" legend a year ago. He allows 
himself considerable freedom in his treatment of the 
themes already popularized by Wagner and others, 
adding new features and reshaping the old where 
such liberties seem desirable. For instance, of the 
character Blanid, in his "Parsifal," he says in his 
preface: "She and her relations to the hero are an 
invention of the present writer, who in this and other 
respects has used the same freedom in reshaping the 
details of the old legend as the mediaeval writers, 
who often differ widely from each other, did not 
scruple to employ." He uses the rhymed iambic 
ten-syllable verse, and his poem runs to the length 
of about two thousand lines. Due acknowledgment 
is made to Wagner. The setting of the poem, in 
an elaborate accompaniment of colored illustration 
and ornamentation, the work of Mr. Willy Poga"ny, 
is of very unusual richness and beauty. There are 
sixteen full-page color-plates, and many drawings 
in monochrome. Even the letter-press is from 
the artist's hand, and is reproduced by lithography, 
together with the border designs. Apart from the 
literary excellence of the work, it is a splendid piece 
of book-making. (Thomas Y. Crowell Co.) 

Chiefly noteworthy among Mr. Thomas B. 
Mosher's offerings for the present season is the 
folio volume containing " Ten Spiritual Designs " 
engraved by Edward Calvert, one of that little group 
of Blake's contemporary disciples whose work has 
been too heavily dimmed by the refulgence of their 
master. Calvert's imagination, like Donne's, led him 
into a realm where the spiritual and the sensuous 
were strangely blended ; and the " visionary gleams " 
which he has given us in these drawings will always 
be cherished for their rare and exquisite beauty. 
Enlarged as they are, the reproductions here pub- 
lished doubtless do fuller justice to the originals than 
even the artist's proofs from which they were made. 
A " Foreword " by Mr. Mosher, a reprinted essay on 
Calvert by Mr. Herbert P. Home, and some brief 
notices from various sources, contain whatever in- 
formation is necessary to a proper understanding of 
the artist and his work. Next in interest is a quarto 
reprint of Alexander Smith's " Dreamthorp : A Book 
of Essays Written in the Country." First published 
a half-century ago, " Dreamthorp " has made its way 
all too slowly into popular recognition, though the 
elect long since gave it a place on their shelves at 
no great distance from the acknowledged masters 
among English essayists. With Mr. James Ashcrof t 
Noble's eloquent appreciation included by way of 
Introduction, this first adequate edition of " Dream- 
thorp " is a boon for which lovers of literature should 
be heartily grateful. Professor Gilbert Murray's 
fame as a translator of the great Greek tragedies 
has rather obscured the reputation of his original 
three-act play, an experiment in the Greek manner, 



entitled " Andromache," first published in 1 900. 
Mr. Mosher has therefore done well to give this a 
place on his list, in an edition that is typographi- 
cally all that could be desired. Three of Mr. 
Mosher's new books are reprints, in different form, 
of works previously published by him but which have 
long been out of print. These are Mr. Robert 
Bridges's sonnet-sequence, "The Growth of Love," 
now issued with a portrait of the author ; that charm- 
ing anthology, " Songs of Adieu : A Little Book of 
Finale and Farewell "; and Mr. Charles Johnston's 
remarkable renderings from the ancient wisdom 
books of India, "From the Upanishads," now in- 
cluded in the " Vest- Pocket Series." It only 
remains to mention three small miscellaneous vol- 
umes : a rubricated edition of " The Sermon on the 
Mount"; Ernest Dowson's dramatic fantasy, "The 
Pierrot of the Minute," now added to the "Lyric 
Garland" series; and "Songs from an Italian Gar- 
den " by Mrs. A.. Mary F. Robinson, issued in the 
"Venetian Series." We have so often praised the 
form in which Mr. Mosher publishes his books, that 
anything further on that score would be superfluous. 
From the elaborate folio to the little paper-covered 
pocket volume, every title on his list is given a 
typographic setting at once strikingly attractive and 
distinctive. Among Christmas gift-books conforming 
to Dorothy Wordsworth's familiar petition we know 
of nothing better. 

A book about Cambridge University life from 
the pen of a Tennyson (even though not an Alfred 
Tennyson) cannot fail to excite pleasurable expec- 
tations on being opened. Mr. Charles Tennyson's 
"Cambridge from Within" (Jacobs) has that per- 
sonal and reminiscent quality that can raise chronicle 
and description out of the bleak category of guide- 
book literature and make the writer's pages glow 
with something of the warmth and color of life. In 
his introductory chapter Mr. Tennyson observes 
that "a prudent chronicler will do well to confine 
himself to the comparative certainty of personal rem- 
iniscence " in handling a subject of so many varied 
aspects as his. Then follows a series of pen-pictures 
of academic routine and academic customs, college 
dons and college undergraduates, methods of work 
and modes of diversion, interspersed with frequent 
illustrations, in water-color or in sepia, from Mr. 
Harry Morley's experienced hand. The book's hu- 
morous dedication, "to the friends who may recog- 
nize each other, but I hope not themselves, in the 
following pages," is in itself a promise of good 
things to come. 

To her series of "Myths and Legends" Miss 
Katharine Berry Judson adds this year a fourth 
volume entitled " Myths and Legends of the Great 
Plains " ( McClurg), which she frankly acknowledges 
to be a compilation from such sources as the annual 
reports of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the 
publications of the United States Geographical and 
Geological Survey, and the works of various ethno- 
logists. A great number of legends, ascribed to 
various Indian tribes, are brought together in brief

and readable form, sometimes in verse, and with 
occasional illustrations of native origin. A petro- 
glyph in Nebraska is reproduced, portraits of two 
Indian chiefs are given, and other suitable pictures 
are provided. The book is excellent as a popular 
and at the same time faithful treatment of its subject. 
Zeal and industry and an equipment of rather 
unusual learning have gone into the making of Mr. 
Lewis Spenee's elaborate volume on "The Myths 
of Mexico and Peru" (Crowell). The subject is 
one that still invites the researches of archaeologists 
and philologists, and the author laments that so 
little interest in it has yet been taken by English 
scholars. Notable is his emphatically-declared belief 
in the native origin of the civilization of Mexico, 
Central America, and Peru, a subject on which, as 
he remarks, much mistaken erudition has been lav- 
ished. Rather more than two-thirds of his book is 
devoted to Mexico, the concluding portion to Peru, 
with appended maps, bibliography, language notes, 
and a combined glossary and index. Sixty full- 
page illustrations, some in color, add to the book's 
attractiveness. 

Some of the last productions of the pen of her 
whom her readers will ever remember by her maiden 
name of Myrtle Reed, rather than by her married 
name of Mrs. James S. McCallough, are gathered 
into a lavender-bound volume under the title, 
"Happy Women " (Putnam). Happy these women 
were in that they had a high purpose in life and 
attained it. Here is the list: Dolly Madison, Queen 
Louise of Prussia, Dorothy Wordsworth, Caroline 
Herschel, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charlotte 
Cushman, Lucretia Mott, Florence Nightingale, 
Dorothy Pattison, Jenny Lind, Louisa Alcott, and 
Queen Victoria. A portrait of each is given, also 
a sympathetic introduction, biographical and appre- 
ciative, contributed by Mrs. Mary Badollet Powell, 
a friend and admirer of the author of the book. 

A series of " Fellowship Books " (Dutton) under 
the general editorship of Miss Mary Stratton, starts 
with four short and wholesome treatises on " Friend- 
ship," by Mr. Clifford Bax, " The Joy of the Theatre," 
by Mr. Gilbert Cannan, "Divine Discontent," by 
Mr. James Guthrie,and "The Quest of the Ideal," 
by Mrs. Grace Rhys. Each writer is left to choose 
his or her own subject, and only those who are in 
sympathy with the purpose of the series are invited 
to contribute. The series is described as "a new 
contribution toward the expression of the human 
ideal and artistic faith of our own day," and it seeks 
"to recall the elemental truths whence springs all 
that makes life worth living, the factors that increase 
our common enjoyment of nature, poetry and art." 
A list of able writers for forthcoming volumes is 
announced. Each issue is attractively bound in blue 
and gilt, with paper wrapper. Press-work is of the 
best. The quality and inexpensiveness of these 
little books should secure them a good circulation. 
They are an excellent corrective to materialism in 
its manifold forms. 

A delightful spirit of frivolity pervades the five 



little volumes of the " Onyx Series," books made up 
of snippets of prose and verse rather more verse 
than prose all from the nimble pen of Miss Car- 
olyn Wells. The titles of these five smile-begetters 
are: "Girls and Gayety," "The Eternal Feminine," 
"Pleasing Prose," "The Re-echo Club," and 
" Christmas Carollin'." The connoisseur will prob- 
ably like best of all "The Re-echo Club," in which 
bits of verse on nonsensical themes are given in the 
manner of various eminent poets. Faithful to its 
name, the series is printed on paper of onyx pat- 
tern and hues, and a cover-design in imitation of 
lace decorates the binding. Miss Wells proves her- 
self the possessor of an all but inexhaustible fund 
of fun ; her hilarity chimes well with the Christmas 
season. (Franklin Bigelow Corporation.) 

Another book is added to Mr. Wayne Whipple's 
" Story-Life " series in " The Story-Life of the Son 
of Man " (Revell), which, following the plan so 
successfully adopted in the similar biographies of 
Washington and Lincoln, has brought together into 
an elaborate mosaic nearly a thousand well-considered 
selections from many sources from Geikie, Eders- 
heim, Farrar, Beecher, and a large company of more 
recent writers, with occasional extracts from the 
poets, and frequent insertions of suitable illustra- 
tions, also gathered from a variety of sources. A 
comprehensive index closes the book, which extends 
to nearly six hundred pages. Such unity and sym- 
metry as it is possible to give to a structure built of 
so varying material, the guiding mind of the com- 
piler seems to have given to this "book of a thou- 
sand stories," as he calls it, and " story of a thousand 
books." 

The water-color illustrations from the brush of 
Mr. Harry Morley constitute not the least admirable 
feature of Mr. Alfred Hyatt's latest additions to his 
series of topographical anthologies that began with 
"The Charm of London," illustrated by Mr. Yoshio 
Markino, and continued with a similar work on 
Venice, illustrated by Mr. Harald Sund, and is now 
further enlarged by the addition of "The Charm 
of Paris" and "The Charm of Edinburgh." Each 
volume has twelve colored plates, light and graceful 
in character, and the reading matter includes both 
prose and verse from a wide range of authors. 
(George W. Jacobs & Co.) 

Seven popular songs of the South are grouped in 
a lavishly illustrated volume under the title "The 
Old Plantation Melodies" (Caldwell), the words 
and music of each song, plainly printed, being 
followed by an ornamental reproduction of the lines, 
one or two on a page, with pictorial accompaniment 
on the opposite page. "My Old Kentucky Home," 
"The Swanee River," "Massa's in the Cold, Cold 
Ground," and "Nellie Was a Lady," all by Stephen 
Collins Foster, make their welcome appearance ; also 
"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground," by Walter 
Kittredge, "Marching through Georgia," by Henry 
C. Work, and "Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! the Boys 
are" Marching," by George F. Root. Portraits and 
other illustrative accessories are supplied.

NOTES. 



A volume of "Essays, Political and Literary" by 
the Earl of Cromer is to be published shortly by 
Messrs. Macmillan. 

A Life of Admiral Semmes, by Mr. Colyer Meri- 
wether, will be added soon to Messrs. George W. 
Jacobs & Co.'s " American Crisis Biographies." 

The recent edition of Mrs. Meynell's collected poems 
is to be followed shortly by a uniform volume of 
selected essays from her pen'. 

Miss Inez Hayues Gillmore's story, " Angel Island," 
now appearing as a serial in the "American Magazine," 
will be published in book form next month by Messrs. 
Holt & Co. 

" Maximilian in Mexico," by Mr. Percy M. Martin, 
is a timely volume to be issued at once by Messrs. 
Scribner. The narrative is based on original documents, 
official and private, in English, French, and Spanish. 

An illustrated holiday edition of Mr. E. V. Lucas's 
popular anthology, " The Open Road," will be pub- 
lished immediately by Messrs. Holt. Sixteen pictures 
in color are supplied by an English artist, Mr. Claude 
Sheppardson. 

It is evidently Mr. G. K. Chesterton's intention to 
attempt every known literary form. A play from his 
pen is now announced by Messrs. Putnam. Its title is 
" Magic," and it is described by the author as " a fan- 
tastic comedy." 

The publication of Mr. G. K. Chesterton's forthcoming 
novel, " The Flying Inn," has been postponed by the 
John Lane Company until January, 1914. This will 
permit of simultaneous publication in Canada and Eng- 
land also. 

The story of one of Marie Antoinette's favorite musi- 
cians, a great singer of his time and an arbiter of fashion, 
is told in "Pierre Garat: Singer and Exquisite" by Mr. 
Bernard Miall, announced for immediate publication 
by Messrs. Scribner. 

Among other Oxford Press books in active prepara- 
tion are a volume of " Studies in the Odyssey," by Mr. 
J. A. K. Thomson; " English University Drama, 1540- 
1603," by Mr. F. S. Boas; "A Glossary of Tudor and 
Stuart Words," by W. W. Skeat, completed by Mr. 
A. L. Mayhew; and a " Concise Dante Dictionary" by 
Dr. Paget Toynbee. 

" The Sonnets of William Shakespeare : New Light 
and Old Evidence," by the Countess de Chambrun, is 
announced by Messrs. Putnam. According to its pub- 
lishers, this new edition of Shakespeare's sonnets con- 
tains, in the editor's introductory discussion, "a piquantly 
readable as well as scholarly contribution to one of the 
most unsettled of literary problems." 

Two new volumes by Rabindranath Tagore, to whom 
the Nobel Prize for literature was recently awarded, 
will be issued at once by Messrs. Macmillan. These 
two books are " The Crescent Moon," a volume of child 
poems with illustrations in color by a Hindu artist, and 
"Sadhana: The Realization of Life," a number of 
essays, some of which were delivered as lectures at 
Oxford and Harvard. 

The Indiana Library Association has issued a " hand- 
book," in pamphlet form, giving the history of its origin 
in 1891 and its subsequent growth. Miss Mary Eileen 
Ahern, whose portrait appropriately faces the title-page, 
called the association into being when she was assistant 
librarian of the Indiana State Library; and from an

initial membership of eight it has grown to a member- 
ship of one hundred and forty, not including nineteen 
institutional members," chiefly libraries. It is a highly 
creditable record. 

To the library of Brown University has been presented 
by the class of 1872 the private library formerly owned 
by Dr. Adrian Scott, a member of that class and at one 
time Associate Professor of Germanic Languages in the 
University. The collection numbers about one thousand 
volumes, chiefly philological and literary in their con- 
tents, and is especially rich in Sanskrit, Pali, and Ice- 
landic works. It also has many of the Greek and Latin 
classics, often interleaved and enriched with translations 
from Dr. Scott's pen. 

That the discontinuance of the Doves Press, about 
which we have heard rumors of late, is not a matter of 
the immediate future at least is rather proved by the 
announcement of nine new volumes now under way 
at the Press for issue in 1914 and 1915. During the 
coming year we are to have the " Coriolanus," which 
has been held back for some time by Mr. Cobden- 
Sanderson's illness ; " Amantium Irae : Letters addressed 
by T. J. S. to Lord and Lady Amberley in the years 
1864-1867 "; volumes of poems by Keats and Shelley, 
as selected and arranged by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson; 
and Shakespeare's " The Rape of Lucrece."

and the circumstances of the invention of chess ; and to 
trace the development of the modern European game

OLD HALLOWELL ON THE KENNEBEC 

By EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON 

Author of Old Colonial Houses in Maine, and other works 
Is a new book on the early Colonial and later local history of 
the Kennebec, a book to quote from the Boston Evening 
Transcript "true as history, compelling as romance, ... of 
great interest and value as a contribution to the history of New 
England. From the records of the Plymouth settlers, who estab- 
lished a trading post on the Kennebec in 1627, from the Relations 
of the Jesuits, who had a mission there among the Abenakis, 
from old-time letters and unpublished manuscripts, from early 
newspapers and for the later decades from her own girlhood 
memories, Mrs. Nason has produced in this volume a picture of 
the social and intellectual life of Old Hallowell, notable not only 
for its scholarly accuracy, but also for its rare literary charm. 
The volume is illustrated with sixty-four full-page half-tones 
from photographs of rare portraits, of fine old houses, and of 
the picturesque scenery of Hallowell. It is an octavo of 359 
pages, with broad margins, gilt top, and rich cloth binding. Its 
price is $3.50 ; postage, 24 cents extra.

all who are interested in Western history and adventure, has

A BOOK FOR ALL LOVERS OF POETRY 

THE POEM-BOOK 
OF THE GAEL 

Translations from Irish Gaelic Poetry into 
English Prose and Verse 

Selected and Edited by 
ELEANOR HULL 

T^HE wide range and variety of Irish Gaelic poetry has 
L never been adequately represented in English prose and 
verse. Arising in pre-Christian times, many of the ancient 
poems bear the mark of their primitive heroic origin ; and 
from that period, through the poems and hymns of early 
Christianity, the patriotic vterses of the bards, and the tender 
religious and love sBngs still to be found among the Gaelic- 
speaking districts of Ireland, we have an unbroken output of 
beautiful verse. Miss Hull has attempted to give a repre- 
sentative collection of these poems, including selections from 
the important early religious poem, the "Saltair na Rann," 
of which no part has hitherto been published in English. 
Poems by Mangan, Sir Samuel Ferguson, Dr. Hyde, Mr. 
A. P. Graves, Padraic Colum, and others are included in the 
Anthology, but the larger number of the translations in prose 
and verse are new. The book contains an Introduction and 
Notes, and is adorned by initial letters, title-page, and bind- 
ing design, drawn from Celtic manuscripts. The frontispiece 
is reproduced from the opening lines of the "Saltair na 
Rann," in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The volume should 
make a delightful Christmas gift for lovers of poetry and 
lovers of Ireland.

is Art ? What does Art do to the

appreciates ? These questions underlie this 
work, which deals with the meaning and func- 
tion of sculpture, painting, music and poetry and 
their interrelation. The author's purpose and 
method may be comprehended from his remark 
that it is "not a restatement of criticism and 
philosophy, but the condensed result of twenty- 
five years' study of works of art, in each of the 
four fields, recording and interpreting what these 
masterpieces have done to my senses, emotions, 

imagination and intellect."

JOYS OF THE ROAD 

A LITTLE ANTHOLOGY 
IN PRAISE OF WALKING 

Some of the best things, in both prose and verse, 
that have been said of the pleasures of walking, 
are here brought together. The contents consist 
chiefly of four essays, as follows: "On Going 
a Journey," by William Hazlitt ; "Walking 
Tours," by Robert Louis Stevenson; "Walk- 
ing," by Henry David Thoreau ; and "The 
Exhilarations of the Road," by John Burroughs. 
Interspersed with these essays are a number of 
poems on the same subject, by such writers as 
Bliss Carman, Arthur Symons, Robert Louis 
Stevenson, and others. Everyone who loves 
the open air will rejoice in this little book, and 
will find it an ideal pocket companion for his 
excursions on " the open road." 

" As charming a little book as one could wish to possess. 
. . . The very breath of the open blows through these fra- 
grant pages, and healthier lovelier literature it were hard 
to find. The compiler shows his taste and his knowledge 
of letters in making this volume, which is of pocket size, 
simple but attractive in print, end-papers, and binding."

Pacific Shores from Panama 
By Ernest Peixotto 

Described by the Author with a Singular Charm 
and Delicacy in both Word and Picture 

The voyage that he describes in the dual capacity 
of author and artist was in a sense discovered by 
himself that is, as a pleasure voyage. Nobody 
else had made the trip, except for some commercial 
object at least nobody who had a gift for telling 
about it. All the time he was sketching with pencil 
or brush. $2.50 net; by mail $2.69 

Stevenson's " Kidnapped " 

Illustrated by N. C. Wyeth with full-color pictures, 
lining paper, and cover design 

Mr. Wyeth is making pictures of a great variety 
of subject now; is not confined to any fixed types, 
by any means. But he is really at his best when he 
portrays scenes of action out-of-doors. He has put 
David and Alan Breck and others into a form in 
which after this they will always be visualized. He 
has caught the atmosphere of Scotland, and he has 
been marvellously successful in the handling of the 
effects of light. $2.25 net; postage extra 

Kenneth Grahame's 
The Wind in the Willows 

Illustrated with full-color pictures by Paul Bransora 
Most of the lovers of this book will not believe 
that it has been successfully illustrated in color 
so delicately and curiously do its many qualities 
blend until they see for themselves by examining 
the ten full-page illustrations by Paul Bransom, 
which picture its various episodes. No description 
of these pictures will convince them nothing but 
the actual fact looking them in the face.

The Panama Gateway

The South American is one of the leading papers

" Should prove to be the best selling book of the 
year on Panama. . . . His story of the Panama 
Revolution is thoroughly official in character. The 
description of the working of the Gatun locks is 
fascinating and the thorough manner in which Mr. 
Bishop has explained the mechanism of this whole 
undertaking is most interesting."

The United States and Mexico 
By George L. Rives 

Highly Praised by John Bassett Moore, Assistant Secretary 
of State, and by All Leading Reviewers 

" The plan is well conceived and comprehensive ; the various parts are admirably designed and corre- 
lated; and each phase of the subject is treated adequately and in due proportion. The amplitude of the 
author's researches in historical sources, manuscript as well as printed, is attested on every page, while his 
thorough mastery of his subject and the directness and lucidity of his style have enabled him to impart to 
his narrative a remarkable vividness and charm. The appearance at the present moment of this important, 
instructive, and very enlightening exposition of the relations between the United States and Mexico during 
the formative and critical period to which it relates, is singularly opportune." John Bassett Moore. 

" Quite indisputably a ' standard work.' " New York Sun.

maid said to me, as we sat by the window : ' There is Mr. 
Choate.' I looked and saw a tall man with black hair

tive mouth, the quiet, sad, and kindly eyes, took you out 
of yourself into unselfish counsel. Give Douglas five 
minutes and Lincoln five minutes before an audience 
which knew neither, and Mr. Douglas would make the 
greater impression, but give each an hour, the contrary 
would be true."

STUDIES IN MILTON 

AND AN ESSAY ON POETRY 

By ALDEN SAMPSON, A.M. 

(Haverford College and Harvard University) 

Illustrated with a wood- cut by Timothy Cole' 

N.A., from the bust in clay of Milton at 

Christ's College, Cambridge, England. 

The studies which compose this volume deal mainly with 
the middle period of Milton's poetical life, and are an 
examination of his development as a poet and of the vari- 
ous circumstances which shaped and brought to its final 
effectiveness his lifelong purpose to write a great epic poem. 
The comparatively meagre expression in verse belonging 
to this part of his career is illustrated by comparison with 
the rich product of his muse in the preceding and following 
periods. These years, although almost barren of poetic 
fruit, were vital and formative ones, educating and enrich- 
ing his nature, enabling him finally to speak with com- 
manding power as poet, statesman, moralist, and impas- 
sioned lover of liberty. 

The last essay, entitled CertainAspectsofthePoeticGenius, 
affords the author opportunity to examine the contribu- 
tions of several of the great masters of poetry, and to dwell 
with somewhat of care upon a very fascinating subject. 
(A limited number of proof t on Japanese paper, printed from 
the 'wood-cut by Timothy Cole, N.A., in folders of heavy 
Japanese paper, may be procured from the publishers. Price

A FEW WORDS ABOUT MOSS. 



A correspondent writes to inform us that, in 
his amiable opinion, THE DIAL no longer gives 
" the time o' day," and " is getting moss-grown." 
By way of specification, he adduces certain 
recent "reactionary defences of some of our 
crumbling inheritances, a Constitution framed 
for a social condition no longer actual ; an edu- 
cation which wastes years on irrelevant matters, 
a chaotic spelling which does not represent the 
phonetic values of our speech to-day." At one 
point in his charge, our correspondent is decid- 
edly astray. As regards the metaphorical 
"moss" indicated by this bill of particulars, 
we must avow that it is no recent growth, but 
is at least as hoary as our thirty odd years of 
existence. Our opinions upon these three sub- 
jects have been expressed during all that period 
with unswerving fidelity to our convictions. 
Stripped of their question-begging qualifications, 
the animadversions cited become very harmless 
indeed. We hold the federal constitution in 
reverence because we realize that for a century 
and a third it has given stability to our national 
life and continuity to our history, and the virtue 
by which these things have been achieved is 
precisely that it was not framed for any fleeting 
social condition, but upon such broad lines of 
principle that it provides a polity no less fitted 
to the needs of one hundred millions of people 
than it was to the three millions who first put it 
into operation. 

By the irrelevant matters on which our cor- 
respondent thinks years of education are wasted, 
he probably means the language disciplines and 
the humanistic studies described by such terms 
as the classics, literature, and history. At least, 
that is what people of his mental habit usually 
mean when they employ such language. Now 
we have always stood for these studies as the 
only ones really relevant to education in its 
deeper meaning, and have stigmatized as the 
most consummate folly the attempt to displace 
them by what are thoughtlessly called "prac- 
tical " subjects. If to do this is to be nauseous, 
we welcome the aspersion. A writer in " The 
Nation" from Los Angeles tells us that the 
schools in that city have become so modern as to 
acquire a deficit of half a million dollars, while

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



" distinguished, self-made men tell children how 
to become educated without studying," and 
"the Teachers' Institute meets at Christmas- 
tide to talk about social obligation and brotherly 
love and sneer at intellectual effort and attain- 
ment." There is nothing moss-grown about that. 
In a more elevated strain, we may quote from 
a recent address by Mr. Paul Elmer More, who 
says : " The classics have pretty well gone, and 
if we study them at all it is as if they were dead 
languages, useful it may be as a gymnastic dis- 
cipline for the mind, but with little or no sense 
that they contain a body of human experience 
and tried wisdom by which we may still guide 
our steps as we stumble upon the dark ways of 
this earth." Quotations of this sort might, of 
course, be multiplied indefinitely, for everybody 
who has ever written anything worth saying on 
the vital subject of education has paid a similar 
tribute to the value of the classics, and in sub- 
scribing to this opinion we find ourselves in the 
very best of intellectual company. 

As for the orthodox spelling, our position 
on that subject has been so frequently expressed 
as to need no restatement now. Our corre- 
spondent dislikes the spelling because it "does 
not represent the phonetic values of our speech 
to-day." Bnt suppose we made it represent 
them, would it do so fifty years from now? Or 
shall we keep on reforming it at stated intervals, 
so that the palaeographist of the future may be 
able to refer any page of English print to the 
decade of its origin by a -study of its ortho- 
graphical vagaries? It required centuries of 
effort to standardize our spelling, but the thing 
was finally done sometime in the eighteenth 
century, and ever since then we have had the 
immense advantage of possessing a corpus of 
printed literature varying but slightly from the 
standard, and all intelligible without difficulty 
to every reader of to-day's newspaper. This is 
a boon not lightly to be scorned, and certainly 
not to be rejected for any of the petty reasons 
suggested by apologists for the new phonetic 
heterodoxy. 

Our correspondent describes himself as " im- 
patient of that futile iconoclasm of conservatism 
which pettishly condemns every new image 
which is tried in the vacant niches of our de- 
populated Pantheon." This is turning the tables 
with a vengeance ! We had not thought to be 
classed with the iconoclasts for defending the 
old established ways, and insisting upon the 
value of the fruits of experience. To the motto, 
" Whatever was, is wrong," which seems to be 
the watchword of the host that commits violent 



assault upon the old politics and the old ideals, 
we much prefer the Pauline injunction : " Prove 
all things; hold fast that which is good." In 
any given case, the chances are at least nine out 
of ten that the old way is the better one, and 
no reform that does not accept the principle of 
festina lente is likely to accomplish anything in 
the way of real progress. The most plausible 
suggestion, once put into operation, is sure to 
bring unanticipated evils in its train, and its 
actual working is incalculable in advance. For 
the sentimental gain immediately offered there 
is more than likely to be bartered some very solid 
good the loss of which will prove irremediable. 
It was with a sense of these truths that Ruskin, 
whom most of our reformers-in-a-hurry would 
claim for their own, described himself as " a 
violent illiberal," and refused to accept the pre- 
posterous proposition that the new thing must 
be good just because it is new and untried. 

Quite the most ominous characteristic of our 
unsettled modern thought is its apparent readi- 
ness to cast off all the political, social, and ethical 
moorings that hold it in its hard-won haven, and 
to steer an uncharted course into the unknown. 
It is the duty of every sober lover of his kind 
to counsel prudence in all such reckless depart- 
ures, and to offer the teachings of history as a 
counterbalance to the speculative visions of the 
theeorist and doctrinaire. The Zeitgeist is now, 
as perhaps never before, obsessed by night- 
mares, and needs to be restored to the normal 
condition of waking mental activity. Criticism 
in the broadest sense criticism not of art alone, 
but of life is the crying need of the time, for 
its searching light alone can dispel the mists that 
obscure our thinking and people with Brocken 
spectres our groping upward path. It is above 
all things else for the open mind that we plead 
not for the mind that admits light through 
a few cracks only and especially for the mind 
that is opened wide on the side of the past, with 
its accumulated wisdom for our guidance, and 
which respects, because of the immense weight 
of its authority, the present institutions and 
ideals into which the thought of that past has 
become crystallized. On the other hand, the 
querulously intolerant type of mind represented 
by the correspondent from whom we have quoted, 
seems to us quite impotent to contribute any- 
thing of value to the advancement of the race. 
Its fundamental postulate is a denial of sincerity 
to the mind that is not in agreement with its 
ill-considered conclusions, and upon that basis 
no real threshing-out of the questions that per- 
plex the modern world is possible.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A NOTABLE TRIBUTE TO AN AMERICAN HIS- 
TORIAN was that paid to Professor John Bach 
McMaster in Philadelphia on November 22. To 
commemorate the completion of his thirty years' 
work in writing his "History of the People of the 
United States " a testimonial dinner was given to 
Dr. McMaster in the great hall of the Historical 
Society of Pennsylvania by eminent men of Phila- 
delphia, New York, and other places. The guests 
included Presidents and leading professors of Yale, 
University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, Prince- 
ton, University of Michigan, Columbia, and many 
colleges. There were present railroad presidents 
and directors, Governors of States, United States 
Senators, magazine editors including the editors of 
"The Atlantic Monthly" and "The Review of 
Reviews," famous military leaders, economists, 
ambassadors, judges, publishers, historians, biogra- 
phers, novelists, poets, lawyers, preachers, and phy- 
sicians. The toastmaster was Dr. S. Weir Mitchell. 
Addresses were made by Dean West of Princeton, 
Provost Smith of the University of Pennsylvania, 
Ex-Governor Pennypacker of Pennsylvania, Pro- 
fessor Max Farrand of Yale, Dr. Albert Shaw of 
" The Review of Reviews," Professor McGuckin of 
the College of the City of New York, Dr. Talcott 
Williams of Columbia, and Professor McMaster. 
Cordial letters of congratulation came from many 
countries. Ex-President Roosevelt wrote that he was 
taking McMaster's final volume to South America. 
Mr. George Otto Trevelyan wrote from England: 
" I have turned my third quarter of a century. It 
is sad to know that I shall never visit Philadelphia. 
Professor McMaster is indeed fortunate in being 
entertained on such an occasion in a city so devoted 
to historical inquiry and so rarely acquainted with 
everything that relates to its own famous past. To 
the generosity with which Philadelphia imparts the 
results of that knowledge to others I have for many 
years owed a large debt of gratitude. The senti- 
ment with which Professor McMaster's readers 
regard the completion of his invaluable work is one 
of genuine admiration of the warmest character." 
Guglielmo Ferrero wrote from Turin expressing his 
gratification at the realization of the importance of 
the social mission of the historian. Brooks Adams, 
George W. Cable, Joseph H. Choate, W. L. Grant 
of Queen's University, Ontario, Professor Albert 
Bushnell Hart of Harvard, Chancellor Kirtland of 
Vanderbilt, Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, Pro- 
fessor McLaughlin of the University of Chicago, 
Professor Marcks of Munich, James Schouler, 
James Ford Rhodes, Professor Stephens of the Uni- 
versity of California, President Thwing of Western 
Reserve University, and the Ambassadors Thomas 
Nelson Page, Walter H. Page, and Henry van Dyke 
were among the hundreds of prominent men sending 
hearty letters of congratulation to Dr. McMaster 
and of admiration for his work. 



THE TRANSLATOR'S OPPORTUNITY to do what 
might almost be called creative work in interpreting 
a foreign author has been perceived and grasped by 
a few gifted writers. An exact reproduction of the 
effect of the original is manifestly impossible, and 
a slavishly literal rendering, except in scientific or 
technical literature, is about the last expedient to 
be resorted to for the conveying of that effect. 
This being the case, adaptation, more or less free, 
but not by any means lawless, remains the only 
method available for adequate interpretation of a 
foreign poem or drama or other work of the imagi- 
nation. In this connection, the name of Edward 
FitzGerald naturally comes to mind as that of a 
highly gifted adapter or reshaper of other men's 
productions. His famous quatrains from the Persian 
are perhaps indefensibly free in their variations 
from the original, but the incontestable fact remains 
that no other rendering of the Rubaiydt has been 
offered that can compare with his in poetic charm. 
And his versions from Calderon are scarcely less 
remarkable for their easy flow and their entire 
freedom from the stiffness of ordinary translation. 
Mr. William Poel, writing in "The Contemporary 
Review " on " Poetry in Drama," gives high praise 
to these Calderon pieces of FitzGerald's as being 
suitable for actual production on the stage, and 
contrasts them with the scholarly verse translations 
of Professor Gilbert Murray from the Greek tragic 
poets, which, he says, " do not act well," since they 
fail to reach the height of tragic poetry and afford 
insufficient scope for vocal flexibility. "Decorous 
but dull," he calls them. FitzGerald, too, it should 
not be forgotten, did good work in turning Greek 
tragedy, notably the "Agamemnon" of ^Eschylus, 
into English verse. Coleridge's adaptation of Schil- 
ler's " Wallenstein" is another instance of the ad- 
vantages, for acting purposes, of free rather than 
literal translation, and Mr. Poel does not omit to 
cite it. In a humbler walk of literature, Mrs. 
Wister's long series of unusually popular renderings 
of German fiction offers a remarkable example of 
what a translator's genius can effect in reshaping 
material not too promising in itself. Though the 
Italian proverb, traduttore, traditore, warns one of 
the pitfalls yawning at the translator's feet, they can 
be avoided and are avoided by the translator with a 
real gift for his work. 



THE VALUE OF GREEK STUDIES is not perceived 
or acknowledged by many men immersed in the 
cares and perplexities of modern business. All the 
more remarkable, therefore, is the recognition of 
their utility as well as charm on the part of Mr. 
S. S. McClure in his noteworthy autobiography now 
appearing in the magazine bearing his name. A 
more strenuous struggle for a college education has 
seldom been witnessed than that of this determined 
Irish-American lad at Knox College (of which he 
is now a trustee) in the old days before the time- 
honored classical course had fallen into its present 



514

[Dec. 16 



neglect. "This course," writes Mr. McClure in the 
December instalment of his life-story, " still seems 
to me the soundest preparation for a young man, 
and I still feel that Greek was the most important 
of my studies. During the years that he reads and 
studies Greek a boy gets certain standards that he 
uses all the rest of his life, long after he has for- 
gotten grammar and vocabulary. I enjoyed Greek 
and mathematics more than any other subjects I 
took at college, and Homer more than anything else 
we read in Greek. After I began Homer, I used 
always to give four hours to the preparation of the 
next day's lesson, my best hours, too from six to 
ten in the evening. I looked forward to those hours 
all day." Moving and at times intensely pathetic is 
the story of the young student's undiminished passion 
for learning in the desolate period when a fireless 
room, a diet of frozen bread, a hopeless attachment 
to a professor's daughter (who finally became his 
wife), and other items of dreariness and discourage- 
ment combined to test his pluck and endurance to 
the utmost. Not since Mr. Riis issued his " Making 
of an American " have we had so stirring an account 
of marked achievement under the most forbidding 
of conditions. ... 

REMINISCENCES OF A VETERAN LIBRARIAN con- 
tributed recently to the entertainment of those who 
read the Peoria "Herald-Transcript." Nearly half 
a century ago forty-eight years, to be exact Mr. 
E. S. Willcox, leaving his position as teacher in 
Knox College because of the drain on the student 
body caused by the Civil War, removed to Peoria 
and at once became interested in the library affairs 
of that city. A small subscription library was func- 
tioning rather feebly, with a collection of two thou- 
sand volumes and under a directorate not alive to 
the possibilities of the institution. Mr. Willcox, with 
other progressive spirits, procured the removal of the 
old board and the voting-in of themselves instead. 
In 1872 he drafted a Free Library Bill and was 
successful in having it passed by the State legislature ; 
and its wise provisions are still in force. Stimulated 
by this success, Mr. Willcox and his fellow-directors 
started a campaign for a new library building, 
achieved their purpose, and after a few years found 
still another change of quarters desirable. Then in 
1897, an advantageous sale of. this property being 
effected, the present library building in Monroe 
Street was erected on land granted for the purpose 
by the city ; and there it is probable that Mr. Willcox 
will finish out his term of conspicuously useful ser- 
vice to his community his term as librarian, we 
mean, for that office he has held twenty-two years, 
with a constant and rapid growth in the library's 
activities, as evidenced in part by the opening of a 
branch library in Lincoln Park and the promise of 
another in the northern section of the city. 

A WELL OF ENGLISH NOT ALWAYS UNDEFILED 
is the daily newspaper press of English-speaking 
countries. A compliment, comparable with that paid 



by Spenser to Chaucer, is just now being quoted 
with self-complacence by the newspapers from the 
reported remarks of an Iowa State College professor. 
"With all its faults," avows the lowan, "I still 
believe in the news style as the most efficient style 
of this modern day for presenting information 
through the written word. It has been hammered 
out in the heat and stress of newspaper work to 
meet the demands of millions for something to com- 
pel their attention, interest them, and give them 
information in the quickest, clearest way. . . . The 
news sense, the ability to see what is new, and its 
new meaning to the great world of humanity, is 
necessary to men in every field of endeavor, but 
especially to men who write." No less an authority 
than Mr. H. G. Wells, with his well-known passion 
for the new and his depreciatory estimate of the old, 
has been heard to declare, if memory errs not, that 
journalism deserves to be ranked very high, perhaps 
in the highest class, among the different forms of 
literature. All honor to those that have helped to 
dignify the profession of journalism; but not yet 
will it be universally conceded that the highest 
function of literature is to " compel attention," to 
startle, to " see what is new " and therefore too 
often ephemeral and of trivial import ; and undoubt- 
edly the Iowa professor would assent to this. As 
a contributor, however, of an element of crispness, 
raciness, breeziness, and often of admirable pictur- 
esqueness to English style, the American journalist 
does render a service not to be despised, and his 
British cousin is now not far behind him in this 
particular. ... 

A NEGLECTED ART, that of reading aloud, has 
already been the subject of comment in these col- 
umns, and is likely to receive further attention from 
time to time in the future. In a recent talk to the 
Teachers' Club of Philadelphia, Provost Edgar F. 
Smith of the University of Pennsylvania complained 
that students of to-day do not know how to read 
aloud intelligibly and agreeably. "It is a deplorable 
fact," he affirmed, "that we have many students in 
the university who are unable to read a page from 
a textbook aloud to the class and read it correctly." 
He might with truth have added that there are many 
professors as well as students who lack the art of 
accurate and effective interpretation of the printed 
page. Curiously enough, the decline in this one of 
the formerly indispensable "three R's " seems to date 
its beginning with the discontinuance of the teach- 
ing of the alphabet in the old-fashioned way, and 
the relaxation of severity in the matter of spelling. 
Perhaps our best readers-aloud the compound 
must be pardoned since no simpler term presents 
itself are still to be found among those whose 
education was acquired in the little red schoolhouse, 
whose advantages comparatively few of the present 
generation of infants can ever hope to enjoy. It may 
be, furthermore, that the great increase of reading 
matter in modern times has discouraged the practice 
of reading aloud, so slow is that process compared 



1913]

with the silent skimming of book after book. But 
there is a time to skim and a time to read slowly. 
This we ought to have done, and not to have left 
the other undone. ... 

A CERTAIN DEFECT IN THE MANNERS OF LITER- 
ART FOLK has been remarked over and over again, 
but will probably never be remedied. It is, indeed, 
a defect noticeable in others beside the men and 
women of the pen; but it is in those who write 
much and rapidly that the fault is commonly most 
pronounced. A former Harvard professor of the 
history of art, whom just now one feels especially 
tempted to quote with considerable frequency and 
freedom, used to say that "a plain handwriting is 
a part of good manners," and one of his old pupils 
recalls the assiduity with which he devoted himself 
to the imitating of his instructor's beautifully legible 
style, as a first step toward acquiring some of his 
fine culture. Another Harvard celebrity of the past 
who wrote a hand of exceptional clearness was John 
Fiske, whose term of useful service as assistant 
librarian is pleasantly recalled, in connection with 
the passing of Gore Hall, by a writer in the Boston 
"Transcript." He says, in the course of his remin- 
iscences: "His very manuscript itself was a thing 
of beauty, and must have delighted the compositors 
who had to struggle with the librarian's scraps and 
scrawls. Mr. Fiske wrote the round, clear, open 
style which he said he inherited from his English 
ancestry of clarks, or clerks, and so perfect was his 
first draft that he rarely rewrote a page." Not all 
of us are born artists, even in handwriting; but 
unless one is physically crippled, one ought to be 
able to write in such a manuer as not to encourage 
in others a resort to impolite language. 
... 

BOOK-SELECTION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES is not 
the least important or least difficult part of public 
library work. Some libraries make their selections 
largely through a book-committee formed of several 
members of the directing board ; others throw the 
burden chiefly on the librarian ; others invite the 
public itself to take as active a part as may be in 
this branch of the library's functions ; and nearly 
all are glad to receive intelligent suggestions from 
those for whose benefit all the book-purchases are or 
should be made. At Manitowoc, Wisconsin, as the 
latest report of its librarian explains, " the purchase 
of books is under the direct supervision of the board, 
the books being divided into classes, and to each 
member of the board there is assigned one or more 
of these classes. In that way the different kinds of 
books in the library are kept well balanced, no one 
kind being shown favoritism." This plan of making 
the whole board of directors a book-committee, each 
member specializing in one or more classes of litera- 
ture, is certainly somewhat unusual, and has other 
considerations beside novelty in its favor. Notice- 
able also in the government of the Manitowoc 
library is the exact balancing of male and female 
members on its board; and (a minor detail, it is 



true) in the list of " officers " we find, at the bottom, 
not a janitor, but a janitress. It hardly needs to be 
added that the librarian, as well as the assistants, 
is a woman. Evidently the rights of women are 

respected in Manitowoc. 

... 

THE WORK OF A MASTER PRINTER may attain an 
importance approximating that of a prince of pub- 
lishers. Indeed, the printer was the publisher in 
early times, and the two industries are still more or 
less closely allied. The recent death of J. Stearns 
Gushing, founder of the Norwood (Mass.) printing 
house of J. S. Gushing & Go., brings to its close a 
long term of remarkably productive and successful 
activity in the manufacture of books. The firm 
name, on the reverse of so many title-pages, is famil- 
iar to thousands of readers, who will now feel some 
interest in the history of the head of that firm. 
From the age of fourteen Gushing was engaged, first 
as compositor and later in a less humble capacity, in 
the printing business. After working some years 
for the University Press at Cambridge and in other 
printing establishments, he began, in 1878, with a 
few hundred dollars' capital, to do printing in his 
own name, making a specialty of textbooks and pro- 
viding himself with fonts of type in Greek, Hebrew, 
Assyrian, and other alphabets, and in the symbols 
used in mathematics. These fonts were of widely 
recognized excellence, and spread his fame as a 
printer over the country and even beyond its bor- 
ders. The great establishment at Norwood is the 
significant monument to his ability and honorable 
success as a printer. Honors of another sort also 
came to him, as the command of the Ancient and 
Honorable Artillery Company, the commodoreship 
of the Winthrop Club, a seat in the Governor's 
Council, and a high place in the order of Masons. 

THE STORY TELLER'S VADE MECUM, a book for 
all who find themselves called upon, from time to 
time, to furnish oral entertainment for importunate 
and insatiable young folk in those eager " believing 
years" that should be made the most of while they 
last, is furnished in Miss Helene A. Guerber's 
"Book of the Epic," a compact collection of the 
world's chief romantic tales that have been immor- 
talized in epic form. Miss Guerber tells these 
stories again in simple prose, condensing consider- 
ably, but leaving the kernel intact in its nutshell of 
abbreviated narrative. A score or more of the great 
epics are given in some detail, with frequent quota- 
tions in verse, and many others are less elaborately 
outlined. Where not exactly suited to the age of 
one's listeners, Miss Guerber's versions can easily 
be modified by a skilful story-teller and thus made 
acceptable to young hearers of whatsoever age or 
mental equipment. Thus the " Ramayana " and 
the " Mahabharata," and the Japanese epic of " The 
White Aster," and perhaps also the Persian "Shah- 
Nameh," may be presented in attractive form to 
children by an expert and sympathetic narrator. 
Material for the story-hour that so many public libra- 



516 



THE DIAL,

ries now make it their business to conduct, is ever 
in demand, and the demand increases year by year. 
Hence the propriety of calling especial attention 
to Miss Guerber's thesaurus of story-telling matter 
collected from a wide range of approved sources. 



FIRST STEPS TO THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE 
are not seldom the most difficult, for it is the first 
step that costs, as the French maintain. A little 
familiarity with the equipment of a public library 
is the beginning of useful learning; and yet how 
few there are, comparatively, who seem equal to the 
effort of acquiring that familiarity. '' That an 
' educated ' person of to-day," says Mr. Edward F. 
Stevens, Librarian at Pratt Institute, " should find 
himself helpless in the preseace of a modern library 
equipment so that his sole confidence in making his 
approach lies in his dependence on the help of a 
library assistant, is as pitiful as it is inexcusable. 
To see an able-bodied person of undoubted mental 
powers feebly standing about while an overworked 
librarian dances attendance upon him in a matter 
of commonplace inquiry, is neither unusual nor in- 
spiring." Mr. Stevens then tells some of the things 
the library and the library school attached to the 
Institute are doing to make library-users more self- 
dependent. One public lecture, if the " educated " 
citizens would only attend it, ought to give them all 
the information needed to relieve them of the neces- 
sity of standing feebly about while an overworked 
librarian thumbs the encyclopaedia or consults the 
card-catalogue for them. It is to be hoped that the 
time will come, before many decades, when it will 
be as humiliating to confess inability to use a public 
library's resources with intelligence as it now is to 
acknowledge one's helplessness in the presence of a 

dictionary or a time-table. 



THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION LIBRARY has 
issued its first Bulletin, wherein is set forth the his- 
tory of the library's formation, with an account of 
its present resources, its methods, its generous policy 
toward all who may be interested in its special 
department of literature, and some intimation of 
what it hopes to accomplish in the future. Four 
charitable associations of New York have united 
in establishing this library, which starts with the 
advantage of ample and suitable quarters in the 
new building of the Russell Sage Foundation, at 
Lexington Avenue and Twenty-second Street, and 
already has about ten thousand bound volumes and 
fifteen thousand pamphlets, with two hundred and 
fifty periodicals on its subscription list. The library's 
purpose is to make itself as nearly complete as pos- 
sible in publications relating to charity and social 
work, including a great number of related and sub- 
sidiary topics, and to extend its privileges and 
courtesies to all applicants. Already it has 878 
registered users, and a yearly circulation of more 
than thirty thousand volumes. Bulletins will be 
issued bi-monthly, and they will give much attention 



to the bibliography of those subjects in which the 

library specializes. 



THE TATTERDEMALION OF THE PRINTING PRESS 

is, of course, preeminently the daily newspaper, 
being in its texture nothing but pulverized wood 
fibre, and subject to speedy disintegration from 
atmospheric causes even when handled with the 
extreme care which it never receives. In the cur- 
rent yearly Report of the Pratt Institute Free 
Library occurs a significant paragraph under the 
heading, " Rag in Paper or Papers in Rags," from 
which we learn (or are reminded) that "the Brooklyn 
'Daily Eagle' has earned the distinction of being 
the first daily newspaper in America to print an 
edition on paper containing a considerable propor- 
tion of rag for purposes of preservation in public 
libraries." With the beginning of the present year 
the Pratt Institute Library has procured this special 
edition "in monthly consignments for immediate 
binding," and it deplores the failure of the other 
great dailies to pay similar regard to the needs of 
future historians and other students engaged in 
research requiring much consultation of old files of 
newspapers. At present the "Eagle" seems assured 
of an enviable future preeminence of which other 
journals could easily win a part for themselves. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE OLD ACADEMIC SPIRIT AND THE NEW. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Is not the paragraph regarding " a vanishing type of 
scholarship " in your latest number a bit pessimistic, 
like the lament of the aged Nestor: "Such men 1 never 
saw nor shall I see again ! " In a way, of course, each 
generation produces its own type of scholarship, which 
does its work and is succeeded by a better, which does 
a better work. Only a few years ago the chemist was 
able to know practically the whole field of chemistry: 
just as in the Middle Ages, Roger Bacon, known as the 
doctor admirabilis, was acquainted with everything then 
worth knowing. Now, the field of chemistry is so enor- 
mous that often one "element" carbon, for example 
offers room enough for a dozen specialists, each working 
separately. 

No man in the wide world could be found capable of 
acting as a college president and at the same time 
of teaching one subject satisfactorily. The college 
president, even in the smaller institutions, is mainly a 
business-manager ; he is a living trolley meant to con- 
duct some of the electricity from the great overhead 
system of finance so as to run the machinery which he 
has in charge. If we could turn backward the wheels 
of progress and restore the conditions that prevailed 
fifty or seventy-five years ago, there would be found 
among the multitude of university and college profes- 
sors, now engaged in their specialized work, just as many 
such men to do the individual work as Child, Lowell, 
Gray, Gurney, Longfellow, Lane, Torrey, Goodwin, and 
Pierce. And, per contra, if those men were living now, 
they would have to meet the demands of the present in 
accordance with modern methods, or fail. They prob- 



1913] 



THE DIAL 



517 



ably would meet them; and, by doing so, they would 
make their reputation in a different way. Lowell's 
somewhat slipshop scholarship as well as his appeal to 
a very limited band of scholars, and Norton's views as 
to the vulgarity of American life and scenery, would 
have to be greatly modified to satisfy the hopeful and 
inspiriugly optimistic attitude which one may find, for 
instance (to go to an almost absurd extreme), in the 
struggles of Cubism to break away from the academic 
and to open the eyes of the world to the vibrations of 
color. 

The academic spirit is the dry-rot of Education; and 
while there is undoubtedly too much of it still prevalent 
in most of our Eastern colleges, still the clouds are 
breaking. Such books as Professor Jones's expositions 
of the marvels of modern chemistry and Professor 
Morgan's " Heredity and Sex " are in line with the 
awakening of Idealism all over the country, as shown 
by the growing interest in poetry. These new move- 
ments may be crude; but they have vital powers, and 
they are influencing the higher institutions of learning 
in spite of the pessimistic head-shakings of the old 
fogies. I predict that there will soon come a renaissance 
of interest in the classic languages. Professor Good- 
win's knowledge of Greek was undoubtedly extraordi- 
nary, but my recollection of his teaching it is one of 
the most melancholy of my intellectual life. If Greek, 
instead of being forced upon immature minds, were 
kept for a special season of mental maturity, a man of

SLOVENLY ENGLISH IN POPULAR BOOKS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

When correspondence courses in various phases of 
English can be had for only twenty dollars apiece, surely 
a usage free from errors of grammar should not be 
beyond the attainment of anyone who aspires to see 
his name on the title-page of a book. And yet present- 
day American books of travel and other informative 
literature do not measure up to such a standard. A 
reader of such books soon ceases to be shocked by slips 
in grammar. As to any higher requirement than mere 
grammatical correctness, one dare not apply it. Many 
a book issues from the presses so vulgarly slip-shod 
that a moderately sensitive reader is offended on almost 
every page by poverty of vocabulary, ignorance of sen- 
tence forms, failures in clearness, false placing of em- 
phasis. If the authors of such publications are too far 
advanced in life to profit from instruction in high school 
English classes, they should engage the teacher of En- 
glish in a neighboring high school to revise the manu- 
script for the press. These teachers would feel per- 
fectly at home, since the task would be similar to their 
daily grind in the correcting of student themes. Their 
remuneration should be very slight, for the wretched 
English we have to read is a stigma upon their own 
reputations. With all the millions of themes written, 
criticized, and rewritten by millions of students in our 
high schools and colleges, why is it that in simple clear- 
ness we fall so far behind such writers as Bunyan, 



Defoe, and Franklin ? And where is the conscience of 
the publishers of such books ? Does a monetary profit 
atone for the absence of all literary fineness, all dis- 
tinction of tone, all sense for style ? We might do 
better if half our writers of popular books of informa- 
tion would go into training and become revisers for the 
other half ! Q. D. WANNAMAKER.

"YE" AND "AMPERSAND." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

How does it happen that in copying and reading ancient 
manuscripts we call the character our ancestors meant 
for "the " by the ridiculous "ye ' ? They said "the" just 
as we do, and the only apparent reason for mistaking 
the character is that two centuries ago the letter " h " 
was usually written with a tail below the line, and with 
a razeed top, which made it look like our "y." Then 
the word was so frequently used that it was contracted, 
just as the word "and" was then treated, and continues 
to be treated to this day by many of us. When I was 
a boy, more than eighty years ago, the alphabets in our 
school books always ended with the "short and." We 
called it "ampersand," and considered it a fine snapper 
when we rattled off the alphabet. Sometimes when 
sufficiently cultured we gave it the full title " and-per- 
se-and." Now it is likely that our " & " will become 
obsolete, just as "ye" has become. Then our descend- 
ants of the next century or two will be puzzled, perhaps; 
but I do not think they will be so foolish as to say 
"ampersand " when reading our manuscripts and com- 
ing to the little quirk we meant for "and." Do let us 
drop saying " ye." SAMUEL T. PICKARD.

A MEMORIAL TO SYDNEY SMITH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg the favour of your and your readers' kind con- 
sideration of an appeal which several English public 
men and women (including the Countess of Carlisle, the 
Secretary to the Board of Trade, the Right Hon. Sydney 
Buxton, M.P., the Archbishop of York, Viscount Knuts- 
ford, and the Hon. Sydney Holl.uid) are issuing, for a 
suitable memorial to the memory of that great friend 
of America, the wise and witty Sydney Smith, founder 
of " The Edinburgh Review," able writer, and phil- 
anthropist. He has been described as " the greatest 
humorist whose jokes have come down to us in an 
authenticated and unmutilated form." 

He had an unstinted admiration for your great coun- 
try, which afforded in his opinion "the most magnificent 
picture of human happiness " which the world had ever 
seen. 

We hope to commission a good artist for a bas-relief 
portrait and inscription in the fine old Church of Foston; 
and we also want to provide a good institute for the twin 
villages where Sydney Smith lived. 

The Committee hopes that you may incline to help 
us. Subscriptions should be sent to (Canon) W. H. Carr 
or myself, care The London Joint Stock Bank, York, 
England, and will be acknowledged formally. 

Any help you can give will be gratefully appreciated 
by the Committee. ERNEST E. TAYLOR, 

Hon. Secretary.

THE ENGLISH AT THE SOUTH POLE.* 

Curious mixtures of good and evil, wisdom 
and folly, ability and incompetence, we jog 
along through this world, making what we can 
of ourselves and our environment. Then, some- 
where in our midst, arises a man who does the 
things we have vaguely wished to do, and 
expresses in tangible form the realization of 
our ideals. It is not, properly speaking, a mat- 
ter of genius. The man of genius is one who 
possesses a particular kind of ability in a very 
high degree, and is, as a rule, anything but 
representative of the social ideals of his age. 
He is not necessarily honest or virtuous outside 
of his particular field of activity. Our debt to 
genius is enormous, but these intellectual giants 
are no more to be imitated by us than the 
physical giants of the dime museum. There is 
of course every transition between the different 
types of men, and few if any fall without quali- 
fication into a particular category ; but we seem 
to need a new descriptive term for the small 
but enormously important group of those who 
represent the gold of the common people with- 
out the dross, and thus appeal to that which is 
in every one of us, awaiting new stimuli to 
development. Pedagogically, the distinction here 
indicated is of the greatest importance. What 
we may become, individually and nationally, 
depends to a critical degree upon our ideals, 
and these ideals will never fructify unless they 
are more or less capable of being realized. Incal- 
culable harm has come from holding up before 
the young, as worthy of emulation, those who 
by no means illustrate the normal development 
of our abilities or desirable social activities. 
Christianity itself exhibits the classical example 
of this unhappy confusion. Christ as a miracle- 
worker, Christ as the Lord of Heaven, is above 
and beyond us ; it is Christ as an illustration 
of the possibilities inherent to some degree in 
every man who is the real mainspring of the 
Christian faith; and the idea that he was an 
actor playing a part, instead of a man living a 
man's life, is fatal to the very spirit of the 
religion he founded, as well as contrary to the 
obvious historical facts. 

We have in the history of the world and of 
our nation men who, in their day and genera-

Huxley. With a preface by Sir Clement R. Markham. In

tion, realized social ideals, but it is not enough 
that such men once were great, as were our 
Lincoln and Washington. It is already diffi- 
cult to picture them in this environment; and 
the attempt, while profitable up to a certain 
point, begins to savor a little of that incongruity 
which attached to speculations as to what would 
happen if Christ came to Chicago. It appears 
to be necessary that each new period should 
have heroes of its own, belonging to it and 
characteristic of its particular field of progress. 

When we ask ourselves what sort of man the 
modern hero may be, we realize at once that he 
may be of many kinds, suiting the diversified 
civilization in which we live. He must, however, 
represent his country in its function of helping, 
not destroying, the prosperity of the rest of the 
world. If he is engaged in scientific work, he 
may be said without qualification to do this 
thing. He must work hard and continuously, 
paying as close attention to small as to great 
matters, not seeking to succeed by some sudden 
spectacular play. He must rise superior to the 
common vices of his kind, to commercialism, 
sensationalism, and the rest. Then, beneath all 
this, he must be filled with the zeal and love of 
his fellows which have always marked his kind ; 
and then, as the one thing which enables him 
to use his powers to the utmost, he must be 
without fear. Such a man may be an example 
to us, not because we may be like him, but be- 
cause his virtues are all such as we may cultivate, 
and can vastly improve by cultivation. 

General as our definition is, we have only to 
attempt to apply it, to see how few meii it will 
absolutely fit. It does, however, entirely fit 
Captain Scott and his companions who perished 
on their journey from the South Pole. This 
fact must answer forever the question " Was it 
worth while?" Was it worth while, indeed, to 
vivify and confirm the best ideals of the whole 
Anglo-Saxon race? Was it worth while to show 
the whole world that the sacred flame is yet alive, 
that the mass of degradation which has piled 
upon us in so many ways has not yet extin- 
guished the basic virtues of mankind? Was it 
worth while, especially, to show that the best 
spirit of to-day, which stands for hard work 
unaccompanied by pomp and circumstance, 
offers possibilities of achievement second to 
those of no other age? 

The circumstances attending the death of 
Scott and his fellows appeal strongly to our 
emotions. Probably very few have read of them 
unmoved. We cannot help wishing very, very 
keenly that they had come through alive. Yet,

when we consider the whole history of the ex- 
pedition, and the lives of those men as revealed 
by the record, it is impossible not to see that 
the sacrifice is justified. 

When we read the whole record, as now pub- 
lished, we get some idea of the vast amount of 
scientific work accomplished, and the difficulties 
and dangers overcome in doing it. Unfortu- 
nately it is not possible as yet to give any proper 
abstract of the scientific results, as it will take 
many months, at least, to go over all the ma- 
terials collected, and arrange the data obtained. 
In the meanwhile, the public must believe those 
who know something of this work, when they 
say that it will contribute to the understanding 
of innumerable problems of importance for sci- 
entific progress. The second volume describes 
the various journeys for scientific purposes, 
other than that to the Pole. The men did not 
spare themselves in the effort to make the most 
of their opportunities, and in fact took risks as 
great in many directions as they did in going to 
the Pole. Thus the midwinter journey to Cape 
Crozier, undertaken to obtain the eggs of that 
singular and primitive bird the Emperor Pen- 
guin, certainly justified Captain Scott's remark 
when the men returned : " But look here, you 
know, this is the hardest journey that has ever 
been made." The three men who did this work 
were Wilson, Bowers, and Cherry- Garrard, the 
first two afterwards Scott's companions in the 
final catastrophe on the way from the Pole. As 
we read the details we see clearly that while 
every precaution was taken to insure safety, it 
was really impossible to avoid danger ; over and 
over again circumstances arose which might, had 
things gone a little wrong, have proved fatal. 
There was no recklessness, certainly no desire 
to take any needless risks, but in order to do the 
work it was necessary to take chances. 

On the journey to the Pole the attitude was 
the same. In his last message to the public, 
Captain Scott says : " I maintain that our 
arrangements for returning were quite adequate, 
and that no one in the world would have ex- 
pected the temperatures and surfaces which we 
encountered at this time of the year. On the 
summit in lat. 85-86 we had 20, 30. 
On the Barrier in lat. 82, 10,000 feet lower, 
we had 30 in the day, 47 at night pretty 
regularly, with continuous head wind during our 
day marches. It is clear that these circumstances 
come on very suddenly, and our wreck is cer- 
tainly due to this sudden advent of severe 
weather, which does not seem to have any satis- 
factory cause." In the Meteorological Report 



by Dr. Simpson (vol. 2, p. 319) attention is 
called to the continual blizzards experienced by 
Scott's party, and the comparatively fine weather 
reported by Amundsen. After a close study of 
all the data, it is concluded that " one can now 
say definitely that the blizzards which have been 
so fateful to British Antarctic exploration are 
local winds confined to the western half of the 
Ross Barrier." Thus, as we can now see, the 
Norwegians not only had the advantage of a base 
nearer the Pole, but were in a region of better 
weather. Nevertheless, Scott's party would still 
have come through alive, but for the sickness 
which overtook them and the shortage of fuel. 
The loss of oil through evaporation is explained 
in the appendix, but it certainly ought to have 
been possible to guard against it. The oil, how- 
ever, would still have been sufficient except for 
the extreme cold and the delay. 

In spite of everything, rescue might have 
been possible if those who went out to meet the 
returning polar party had been able to go a little 
farther. On March 10, Cherry- Garrard and 
Demetri, with dogs, were at One Ton Depot, 
only eleven miles from the place where Scott 
and his companions perished. Had they been 
able to proceed for a few days and deposit the 
two weeks' provisions they had brought, this 
would have saved the party ; but the bad 
weather and their physical condition made this 
impossible. On March 10 Captain Scott wrote 
in his diary : " Yesterday we marched up to the 
depot, Mt. Hooper. Cold comfort. Shortage 
on our allowance all round. I don't know that 
anyone is to blame. The dogs which would have 
been our salvation have evidently failed." Thus 
the disaster was due to a combination of adverse 
circumstances, which could not be overcome in 
spite of every effort ; and though we can now 
see how it might conceivably have been pre- 
vented, every man did his very best at the time 
in the light of such knowledge as was available. 

There is absolutely no justification for the 
suggestion which has been lightly made, that 
the polar party, after losing priority in the dis- 
covery of the Pole, had no heart to do their 
best. One hesitates even to mention such an 
idea, and I do not believe it is possible care- 
fully to read the narrative and still entertain it. 
Naturally and very properly, they desired prior- 
ity in this matter, but it was by no means their 
only aim. In October, 1911 (vol. 1, p. 297), 
Scott wrote: "I don't know what to think of 
Amundsen's chances. If he gets to the Pole, it 
must be before we do, as he is bound to travel 
fast with dogs and pretty certain to start early.

On this account I decided at a very early date 
to act exactly as I should have done had he 
not existed. Any attempt to race must have 
wrecked my plan, besides which it does not 
appear the sort of thing one is out for" On 
the whole journey, the scientific end was kept in 
view ; and even during the difficult march down 
the glacier, Dr. Wilson studied and sketched 
the geology, while very important collections of 
fossils were made, which will throw a flood of 
light on former conditions in the south, and 
have an important bearing on general problems 
of evolution. These fossils were dragged, in 
spite of every hardship, to the last camp. 

The volumes are abundantly and beautifully 
illustrated, principally by drawings by Dr. E. A. 
Wilson and photographs by Mr. H. G. Ponting. 
Mr. Leonard Huxley, who arranged the mate- 
rials, seems to have done his work well, and the 
type and paper leave nothing to be desired. A 
few small misprints or errors in copying should 
be corrected; thus in vol. 1, p. 4 13, " shipped" 
should apparently be "slipped," and on p. 417, 
line 9, "last" should be "hot," as the facsimile 
of Scott's letter plainly shows. 

After a time, especially when a good abstract 
of the scientific results can be added, a smaller, 
single volume should be published, giving the 
account of the polar journey and a brief discus- 
sion of the other work. No doubt this will be 
done; but, in the meanwhile, the two- volume 
edition will have a wide circulation, and thanks 
to the public libraries, will be available to thou- 
sands who could not afford to purchase so large 
a work. Parents and teachers should make 
themselves familiar with the facts, and the story 
should be told to successive generations of young 
people for many years to come.

MODERN IDEAS ON STAGE SETTING.* 

Those who wish to be up to date in the arts 
have a busy time nowadays, especially those 
devoted to the drama. Every season brings its 
new excitements. The drama is one of the most 
ancient of the arts, but it appears just now to 
attach less value than any other to the achieve- 
ments of the days of old. Even the art of

painting is less perturbed. Fiction, which rivals 
the stage and the picture in the popular mind, 
is staid in comparison. 

So far as the drama is concerned, we in 
America, as a rule, get only the echoes of the 
great things being done. If we have a drama 
and dramatic ideas of our own, they take but 
a slight place in the minds of cultivated people 
when compared with the sensations we get from 
abroad. American playwrights have produced 
many plays which have been extremely popular 
in America and elsewhere. Some, indeed, have 
produced plays singularly characteristic; few 
dramatists in the world have produced anything 
as typical of the society in which they live as 
Mr. George W. Cohan. But in the main, recent 
excitements have come from abroad. Ibsen, 
Maeterlinck, Rostand, Bernard Shaw and 
Yeats, Synge and Lady Gregory, we have 
nobody who fills such a place in the eyes of the 
world as any of these. 

Not merely is this so in the writing of plays, 
but in the setting of them also. The present 
is a time of immense activity abroad in dramatic 
productions, in the minds of many, the pro- 
ducer seems more important than the poet. 
These activities are little known among us. 
" Everyman " and Shakespeare without scenery 
we appreciated; "Surnurun" and "The Yel- 
low Jacket" also pleased, as they say; the 
Russian Ballet and "The Blue Bird" are even 
now received with warm welcome. We have 
heard of Gordon Craig and Max R^iuhardt. 
But the connection of all these, what they 
have to do with each other, how any of them is 
different from any other dramatic sensation, 
is something that few of us know or care any- 
thing about. We in America are, on the whole, 
well content with the realistic stage. Mr. 
Belasco is our ideal. We do not, in theory, 
attach much importance to the matter of stage 
setting. 

Yet one can see that importance may be at- 
tached to it. The Shakespearean performance 
without scenery showed us how different we are 
from the Elizabethans. We cannot enjoy a 
drama without setting. "The Yellow Jacket" 
was an exotic : amusing, and to many more than 
amusing, but not something that stimulated one 
to follow. Absolute imagination will not do for 
us. But a little thought shows that a realistic 
presentation, whether of Shakespeare or of any- 
thing else, can never be the best that art can do, 
partly because the better it is the less imaginative 
is it ; and partly because however good it is, it 
can never be more than moderately realistic, 



1913] 



THE DIAJ^

never really real. However far we go with real 
water and real trees and so on, there must always 
be so much convention on the stage that there 
might as well be more, if there be anything to 
be gained by it. 

The bare Shakespearean stage has been a 
challenge to the theatre of to-day. 

"The best in this kind are but shadows," 
said the good-natured Theseus, as he looked at 
the clumsy attempts at realism of the Athenian 
clowns, "'and the worst are no worse if the 
imagination amend them." 

" It must be your imagination, then," said the 
impatient Hippolyta, "and not theirs." 

How stir the imagination of the audience? 
Shakespeare did it with poetry and rhetoric, 
and his actors helped him out with elocution 
and gesture. But we prefer our poetry and our 
rhetoric in books, and elocution and gesture we 
incline to leave to the politician. What can the 
stage give us ? Realism, it was thought ; and so 
we still think in America. 

But elsewhere they think differently. How 
to suggest the spirit of the play, how to make 
the art of the theatre really an art, how to make 
the drama truly a thing of the theatre, those 
questions interest people abroad. To state what 
they have done and what they hope to do was 
the purpose of Mr. Huntly Carter in the tour 
among continental cities in which he gathered 
material for his book. He wanted to observe 
and to study the new spirit in the drama (which 
to him, apparently, was most active on the mate- 
rial side), to generalize or get by intuition the 
secret of the movement. I am sorry that I must 
begin by being disagreeable, and saying that he 
does not seem very successful in his latter effort. 
Many will be pleased at his material who will 
by no means think he has been successful in 
analyzing or in expressing the spirit which gives 
it life. Owing, perhaps, to my not knowing 
enough to start with, I find it impossible to see 
what he has seen in the things he tells us of. 
His evidences are still chaotic in my mind. One 
better acquainted with such matters, or perhaps 
more sensitively attuned to their novel rhythms, 
will do better. The book is almost a journalistic 
summary of what the author observed upon his 
brief trip. Yet even so, there is much in it that 
will be very interesting; certainly there is much 
in the way of picture and plan, fact and refer- 
ence, that it would be very hard for one to get 
at otherwise. And to have done so much is no 
slight task ; while to generalize on such material 
is still more difficult. No one has yet done it 
satisfactorily. There are productions of the new 



movement all over Europe, but no common aim 
is obvious. I utterly disbelieve that all are aim- 
ing at Rhythm, as Mr. Huntly Carter appears 
to think ; but what they are aiming at is by no 
means clear. Some are trying for one thing, 
some for another. Reinhardt, Gordon Craig, 
Bakst, to mention a few, agree in one thing: 
they are not realistic. But otherwise it would be 
hard to find much in common, for instance, in 
Reinhardt's production of Gorki's " Nachtasyl," 
Bakst's " Scheherazade," and Gordon Craig's 
drawings for " Macbeth." All are entirely ar- 
tistic, without doubt ; but each seems intent on 
working out ideas of his own. We may doubt- 
less see this much, that all three aim at signifi- 
cance in their settings. And herein lies the im- 
portance for the drama of these matters, which 
might otherwise seem rather material. As the 
tendency of all this theatrical movement is from 
realism to significance, so has been the tendency 
of the drama. Ibsen, the great dramatic influ- 
ence of modern times, is wrongly understood if 
he be thought to be realistic ; his whole tendency 
is toward significance. His plays, plots, char- 
acters, words, all stand for something. So this 
theatrical movement is in the same direction, 
Mr. Carter would say ; in fact, it precedes the 
dramatic. As the drama is really a matter of 
the theatre, the change in the theatre is a change 
in the drama. 

Mr. Carter presents a mass of material on 
this subject containing much that will be new 
to almost anybody. Of the many subjects he 
deals with, two at least are worth saying more 
about, namely the work of Max Reinhardt 
and of Gordon Craig. People may easily find 
out for themselves something about these two: 
a while ago we called attention to the latter's 
book. "On the Art of the Theatre," in which 
he propounded his theories; this was followed 
by the present work, " Towards a New Theatre,"' 
which gives some ideas as to how he would carry 
out his ideas. 

Gordon Craig differs from Max Reinhardt in 
one important respect. Max Reinhardt has for 
some time been able to carry out his own ideas. 
He has been a regular producer of plays for a 
long time; and while he has an abundance of 
ideas on that subject he does not go beyond it. 
Mr. Craig, too, has been producing plays, but 
only that he might learn how to produce; his 
real idea has been to express himself, not to real- 
ize the impressions of others. Since Reinhardt 
became his own master, as we may say, he has 
produced over a hundred plays as different as 
Gorki's " Nachtasyl '' is from Oscar Wilde's 



522 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



" Salome." But he has always had one princi- 
ple in mind, and that principle is the same that 
is of importance to Mr. Craig, namely, the idea 
that stage setting is to strive against natural- 
ism, that it is to be decorative rather than 
realistic, that one is to use color, light, ma- 
chinery, all the resources of modern art, in ex- 
pressing the idea. Add to this the feeling that 
the piece for the theatre is for the theatre, and 
not a matter of philosophy, morals, or any- 
thing else but the theatre, and you will see that 
there will be something in common between the 
settings of Max Reinhardt and the sketches of 
Gordon Craig. I wish there were something 
in English about Reinhardt that one could refer 
to. The book by Jacobsohn will be of interest ; 
but it appears to me to be too largely an account 
of details and not enough a presentation of aims 
and purposes. Perhaps in Germany those mat- 
ters are so commonly understood that one can 
take them for granted. 

Gordon Craig is of more interest to us 
because we can study some, at least, of his work 
at first hand in the collection before us. His 
fundamental idea differs from that of Max 
Reinhardt, in that it is, if one may say so, 
more fundamental. Reinhardt believes that one 
should present plays in a certain way; Mr. 
Craig believes that presentation of plays is but 
a part of the artistic process which should con- 
ceive, express, present, in the theatre as in the 
other arts. Mr. Craig, therefore, is the more 
radical, the more far-reaching of the two. 
Nothing he has yet done is a full carrying out 
of his idea. He has had to handle other men's 
ideas in his own way. The real thing he wanted 
to do was to handle his own ideas in his own 
way. His plan is not that scenery, lights, cos- 
tumes should be used in such and such a way 
to present the thought, language, characters of 
Shakespeare or sombody else, but that scenery, 
light, costume, as well as thought, language, 
poetry, should be the means whereby the artist 
of the theatre sought to express himself. 

Such an idea cannot come to expression 
nearly so easily as an idea like that of Max 
Reinhardt, which limits itself to production 
rather than creation. It is said, however, that 
a plan has finally been formed whereby real 
advance will be made. In the London " Times," 
some time last February, announcement was 
made that Lord Howard de Walden had pro- 
vided the funds necessary to start Mr. Craig's 
School for the Art of the Theatre. This school 
is not in London, but in the Arena Goldoni in 
Florence, one of the most beautiful open-air 



theatres in the world. I have heard nothing 
of the project since last summer, but I men- 
tion it to show that this book of Mr. Craig's 
is a sort of exhibit of what he has been able 
to do before he was able to do what he actually 
wanted to. 

The first impression of Mr. Craig's forty 
plates will, save to the fully initiated, be very 
confusing. But when you have become used 
to the style, and have mentally put together 
those that are but suggestions of theatrical pos- 
sibility, for instance, and those that are scenes 
of plays actually presented and so on, you will 
begin to feel more at home. Note the sketches 
for the scenes in "Hamlet" and "Macbeth": 
they would not serve as models for a stage 
manager, perhaps, but they are easily under- 
stood. Then look at some of the scenes or set- 
tings never realized: "Henry V.," "Hamlet" 
(in the frontispiece), "Dido and ^Eneas." 
Here the artist is freer, perhaps less bound by 
the thought of another, more clearly bent upon 
rendering some sort of impression or sensation. 
Then look at some mere suggestions: "Enter 
the Army," "The Steps," "Study for Move- 
ment." When you are used to the manner you 
will readily catch the general idea, at least. 

Such things will undoubtedly be mere fan- 
cies to many, if not crazy visions. Many who 
glance at them may not have the patience to 
look at them long enough to see what they are 
about. But to me they are of an immense 
value, far greater than that of the photographs 
of the actual settings of Max Reinhardt in Mr. 
Jacobsohn's book. I will not pretend to have 
always a good idea of their purport or always 
to like them. I often fail to get Mr. Craig's 
idea, or else do not sympathize with it when I 
do get it. But if I do not always appreciate 
the plates themselves, I believe I do appreciate 
their spirit; and that is something so valuable 
that were it possible it would be well worth 
while to work over the things one did not under- 
stand till one did understand them, and to 
study the things one did not like till one did 
like them. Get a mind like Mr. Craig's full 
of a fine idea, and it is something worth having. 
Do not fancy that his work for the stage is con- 
nected with this kind of scenery or that, with 
this kind of costume or dancing, or some other. 
He will use any of such things or all of them, 
whatever be the right things, for the carrying 
out of whatever idea he may have in mind for 
artistic expression. His main idea is to present 
a motive by means of the theatre, which means 
by whatever resources the theatre may possess :

poetry, music, acting, dancing, scenery, light, 
costume, and whatever else there may be. 

And it would be a mistake to imagine that 
these things concern only the theatrical manager, 
or the actor, or the person who goes to see plays. 
If you understand them thoroughly (not through 
such transmissions as have preceded), you will 
find them the most influential ideas in the study 
of the drama that you have ever known. Read 
a play of Shakespeare's and imagine that you 
have the chance to devise a setting for it. Do 
not be disturbed because you could not pos- 
sibly do so ; go right ahead. Think first what 
it would be to devise a setting archaeologically 
correct; then try to devise a setting that will 
truly present the spirit of the play. Never 
mind if you have no idea how to design: the 
main thing is that you should first appreciate 
the spirit of the play. Read a play of Ibsen's 
and ask yourself how you will set it. Will you 
try to present the miserable family of a Nor- 
wegian roue or the ill-assorted marriage of some 
high-spirited woman ? Or will it be something 
larger, something more significant, in the his- 
tory of humanity ? In some such way, I fancy, 
may one see that all these experiments on stage 
settings are illuminating even to one who studies 
the drama as literature. For even if litera- 
ture, certainly the drama is theatrical literature. 
Whatever else they may be, the plays of Shake- 
speare are plays, not poems, or novels, or 
essays. And if one wants to understand a 
play one must do at least something to realize 
it as a play. So Shakespeare did, and so Ibsen 
and the rest ; and so must we if we would know 
them - EDWARD E. HALE. 



RECOLLECTIONS OF AN AMERICAN 
SINGER.* 



The volume of reminiscences by Clara Louise 
Kellogg takes us back to an epoch in singing 
and stagecraft which seems to have definitely 
closed, for the time being at least; with small 
indication that its purposes and ideals will ever 
find such revival as the more potent manifesta- 
tions of art are sure to evoke. The coloratura 
singer and the melodramatic opera are no doubt 
still with us, but our admiration and enjoyment 
are subject to an undercurrent of influence which 
emanates from the strenuous teachings of Wagner 
and his compeers. Nevertheless, there is many 
a good word which may truthfully be said in 

* MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN PRIM A DONNA. By Clara 
Louise Kellogg (Mine. Strakosch). Illustrated. New York: 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



favor of the bel canto, the dazzling Italian opera 
of the florid school, and the singers who were 
made illustrious by these outbursts of the musical 
spirit. Clara Louise Kellogg ranks with the 
best coloratura singers of history, and she had 
many elements of high character which were 
often lacking in other representatives of the 
school to which she belonged. She had excep- 
tional understanding of the numerous operatic 
roles in which she appeared ; she had education 
and refinement ; she had acquaintance with the 
great worlds of art and literature and mankind ; 
she came to her task unspoiled by a too solici- 
tous induction into conventions and traditions 
which are fetters and disturbers until so mas- 
tered as to become useful servitors and assist- 
ants ; and she brought to whatever she did her 
native spirit of generosity and courage and cul- 
tured intuitiveness. In consequence, her book 
abounds in appreciations of high interest, in a 
remarkably just apprehension of her own work 
and art, and in a wealth of suggestions which 
the singers of to-day will find it desirable to heed 
and obey. The general impression derived from 
the volume is therefore wholesome, enlightening, 
and even inspiring. 

Clara Louise Kellogg was born at Sumter- 
ville, South Carolina, of Northern parentage. 
The family soon moved to Derby, Connecticut, 
where her earlier years were spent. Of her 
negro nurse she tells the following story : 

" She used to hold me in her arms and rock me back 
and forth, and, as she rocked, she sang; I don't know 
the name of the song she crooned, but 1 still know the 
melody, and have an impression that the words were: 

' Hey Jim along, Jim along Josy ; 
Hey Jim along, Jim along Joe.' 

She used to sing these two lines over and over, so that 
I slept and waked to them ; and my first musical efforts, 
when I was just ten mouths old, were to try to sing this 
ditty in imitation of my negro mammy. When my 
mother first heard me, she became apprehensive, yet I 
kept at it; and by the time I was a year old, I could 
sing it so that it was quite recognizable." 

The father and mother were musical, and the 
child was early taught to use her voice. She 
had the gift of absolute pitch, which afterwards 
came into useful activity when her artistry was 
delighting two continents. She tells us that she 
always heard a melody in the key in which it 
was written ; and as it sometimes happened that 
the same tune was played or sung in a different 
key, the consequent discords were distressing to 
her. She had originally no intention of going 
on the stage. She says : " All I decided was to 
make as much as I could of myself and my voice. 
Many girls I knew studied singing merely as an 
accomplishment. In fact the girl who aspired

professionally was almost unknown. I studied 
first under a Frenchman, named Millet, a gradu- 
ate of the Conservatory of Paris ; later I worked 
with Manzocchi, Rivarde, Errani, and Muzio, 
who was a great friend of Verdi." Muzio was 
her especially devoted teacher and adviser, and 
doubtless from him came the first impulse to 
go on the stage. Among the singers whom she 
heard at this time, and who influenced her pro- 
gress and determination, were the English artist 
Louisa Pine, and the greatly lauded Piccolomini, 
who is described as being like the German prima 
donna, Lucca, small and dark and decidedly 
clever in comedy. But the idol of her youthful 
years was the stately and refined Madame De 
La Grange, a vocalist and actress of the highly 
finished French type. 

Opera in New York had gone through a num- 
ber of vicissitudes before Miss Kellogg's debut 
was made. The early travelling companies had 
culminated in something like a genuine season 
of opera under Garcia, whose famous daughter, 
Malibran, sang in New York before her phenom- 
enal successes in Europe. Lorenzo Da Ponte, 
the restless and eccentric librettist of some of 
the Mozart operas, who had come to America to 
restore his waning fortunes, assisted in the ad- 
venture, which was by no means assured of suc- 
cess. Then came the labors of the Strakosches, 
under whom arose the wonder of Adelina Patti's 
performances; and later appeared Maretzek, 
characterized in this book as " the magnificent." 
Our author adopted the stage only after some 
reluctance, and her family was never wholly 
reconciled to her determination. She thus de- 
scribes her debut, as Gilda in "Rigoletto": 

" My mother was with me behind the scenes, and my 
grandmother was in front to see me in all my stage 
grandeur. I am afraid I did not care particularly 
where either of them was. Certainly I had no thought 
for any one who might be seated out in the Great 
Beyond on the far side of the footlights. I sang the 
second act in a dream, unconscious of any audience, 
hardly conscious of the music or myself, going through 
it all mechanically, but the subconscious mind had been 
at work all the time. The newspapers found my 
appearance peculiar. There was about it < a marked 
development of the intellectual at the expense of the 
physical to which her New England birth may afford 
a key.' The man who wrote this was quite correct. 
He had discovered the Puritan behind the stage trap- 
pings of Gilda." 

Miss Kellogg's first great success was made 
in Gounod's "Faust." The opera was then 
new, and her performance constituted its intro- 
duction to American audiences. The work itself 
was at that time considered an extraordinary 
reversal of the musical conventions. It was 



regarded as the beginning of a revolution in 
opera, so completely were the Italian traditions 
antagonized in its structure and methods. 

" On the other side of the world people were all 
talking of Gounod's new opera the one he had sold 
for only twelve hundred dollars, but which had made 
a wonderful hit both in Paris and London. It was said 
to be startlingly new; and Max Maretzek, in despair 
over the many lukewarm successes we all had, decided 
to have a look at the score. The opera was ' Faust.' 

" With all my pride I was terrified and appalled 
when the ' Magnificent ' came to me, and abruptly told 
me that I was to create the part of Marguerite in 
America. This was a large order for a girl of twenty; 
but I took my courage in both hands and resolved to 
make America proud of me. I was a pioneer when I 
undertook Gounod's music, and I had no notion of what 
to do with it, but my will and ambition were to meet 
the situation." 

The part became one of the best in her reper- 
toire ; and it is interesting, even to-day, to read 
what such critics as George William Curtis said 
about it. The novelty of the opera and the in- 
spiration of the singer very evidently impressed 
the listeners. The rapid changes in opinion 
to-day about the new composers Debussy, 
D'Indy, and others are probably significant 
and instructive in the same way. 

After her decisive American successes, the 
singer went abroad and appeared in England 
and Austria and Russia. One may refer again 
to the generous critic in " Harper's Easy Chair " 
who followed her triumphant processions and 
made his witty and appreciative comments 
thereon, beholding the young American girl in 
her European surroundings, bringing her art 
wholly developed on this side of the ocean to the 
consideration of the old-world connoisseur, who 
placed it on a par with the best of his own con- 
tinent. Then followed many ventures in opera 
and concert; and, finally, the retirement, with 
honor and hearty recognition everywhere. 

A word should be added here concerning the 
singer's efforts to place opera in English worthily 
and adequately before the public. For several 
seasons she was at the head of companies pro- 
ducing the standard works in English ; and 
seems to have made substantial successes, from 
both the financial and the artistic points of view. 
Now that the question of opera in English appears 
to be again before the public, it may be worth 
while to find out from this book what one has 
to say who has toiled in that field with reason- 
able success at a time when the effort was 
probably more difficult than it is to-day. 

This review cannot close without reference 
to the many passages in the book where the 
author writes about her own art, always with 



1913] 



THE DIAL

singular freedom and admirable insight. These 
passages, which are scattered liberally through- 
out her volume, show the bent of her ability, 
and explain the character of her achievement. 
Her art had in especial the traits of refinement 
and intelligence, and her book is full of pene- 
tration into the secrets and labors of the singer 
and the actor. Her generous allusions to her 
fellows, her hearty humor and glancing wit, her 
memories of the notables whom she met in many 
places, all help to make up a book that cannot 
fail to prove of both profit and interest to its 
readers. The reproduction of old daguerreotypes 
and photographs, curious and varied, gives an 
added attraction to the volume.

INDIA THE CONTRADICTORY.* 



Very rarely does a reviewer light upon two 
volumes so delightfully antithetical as the first 
and second listed below. In reading them, one 
looks at India through the eyes of two women 
who could not have seen and reported more 
contradictorily if they had come from different 
planets. Miss Margaret E. Noble was an Irish 
woman who became a convert of the picturesque 
Swarni Vivekananda and identified herself so 
effectively with her adopted cause that she was 
soon known to a multitude of Hindus as Sister 
Nivedita ("The Dedicated"). Dr. Munson is 
an American woman who went to India as a 
medical missionary. Both crossed the seas in a 
laudably generous spirit of devotion to the hap- 
less millions of mankind. Both grew to love 
" the land of burning plains and snow-crowned 
hills and sun-kissed children/' And strangely 
enough, both found, or thought they found, the 
supreme gift of peace, Miss Noble in a mystic 
transcendental, modified Hinduism, Dr. Munson 
in a practical ministry of healing guided by the 
spirit of Him who died on the cross. 

But what different Indias they saw! For 
instance, if one considers their respective verdicts 
on the difficult and insistent problem of native 
widowhood, it is almost incredible that two in- 
telligent and conscientious women with excellent 
opportunities for observation should reach con- 
clusions so flatly contradictory as the following : 

*STUDIES FROM AN EASTERN HOME. By Sister Nivedita 
(Margaret E. Noble). New York: Longmans, Green & Co. 

JUNGLE DAYS. By Arley Munson, M.D. Illustrated. New 
York: D. Apple ton & Co. 

ANGLO-INDIAN STUDIES, By S. M. Mitra. New York: 
Longmans, Green & Co. 



" And yet, and yet, is there anything like the radiant 
purity of the widow's plain white cloth ? Silk for 
worship, cotton for daily service but always white, 
without a touch of colour. Perhaps its charm lies in 
its associations. The austere simplicity speaks of the 
highest only. A heart free to embrace the world, a 
life all consecrated, a past whose sorrow makes the 
present full of giving, these are the secrets that the 
widow's sari tells. 

" For it must be understood that this bereavement is 
regarded in India as a direct call to the religious life. 
It is the only way in which what is known in Catholic 
countries as ' a vocation ' can come to the Hindu wo- 
man. Her life henceforth is to be given to God, not to 
man; and this idea, coupled with an exaggerated respect 
for celibacy, gives to the widow, and especially to her 
who has been a child-widow, a unique position of influ- 
ence in the household. This feeling of reverence per- 
sists long after the sentiments of orthodoxy admira- 
tion for long hours spent in worship and for severe 
asceticism have disappeared. Hence it was a modern 
Hindu, of the school calling itself Reformed, who said 
to me, ' The most stately garment in India is the white 
sari of the widow.' " SISTER NIVEDITA. 

" The baby is married, often to a man of middle age, 
and long before her half-grown body is prepared, she 
is brutally compelled to begin her marital duties, and, 
when yet in her own childhood, she becomes, at the 
peril of her fragile life, the mother of a necessarily 
fragile child. 

" If, through overwhelming misfortune, the girl's 
husband die, her sins in some former existence are sup- 
posed to be the cause of his death, and because of this 
she is an accursed thing. Even though but a babe, and 
knowing nothing of the dead husband, she is at an early 
age stripped of all ornament, and put in the coarsest 
raiment, while her head is shaved close and kept that 
way. Despised, spat upon, cruelly overworked, starved, 
beaten, neglected in illness, forsaken even by those 
nearest of kin to her, the child passes her days in abject 
terror and despair, until death, usually not long delayed, 
blessedly releases her." DR. MUNSON. 

Nor is the foregoing in any way an isolated 
or extreme example, although it occurs in the 
most quotable form. The antithesis runs through 
every topic. Thus, the converted Irish woman 
sees in the native pilgrimages and festivals a 
genuine groping through the material toward 
the supreme essence of Divinity, while Dr. 
Munson sees in them the blind and degrading 
superstition of benighted ignorance. Sister 
Nivedita believes that devotional meditation is 
a form of mind cultivation by which India may 
come to stand once more in the forefront of the 
nations, and that there is in Hinduism full 
sanction for the difficult intellectual transition 
through which the present generations of both 
East and West are passing. In her devotion 
she even shares with the less militant Nation- 
alists the confident hope of a to-morrow when 
the English will be gone, "-leaving an old race 
to dream once more the sweet dreams of labour 



526

[Dec. 16 



and poetry and beauty, till the net of Maya 
shall be broken and they be lost in the ocean 
of beatific vision." Dr. Munson sees a better 
future for India only in the Christian religion 
and occidental guidance toward a slow and pain- 
ful betterment. The contrast is complete, and 
a reviewer may leave his readers to make their 
own decisions unburdened by his reflections. 

Turning for a moment to the " Studies from 
an Eastern Home," one may report that it con- 
tains not only a number of pages such as would 
be indicated by the title, but also a concise 
account of the author's life and several inter- 
esting tributes to her devotion and service. The 
essays are twenty-three in number and present 
a great diversity of themes, from " The Festival 
of Ras " to " The Kashmir Shawl." In all of 
them things are seen, or at any rate depicted, 
couleur de rose, reflecting the moods of a 
thorough-going convert to a vivified Hinduism. 
The chapters are uniformly well written and 
the treatment unhackneyed. To prospective 
readers, however, it might be suggested that a 
better starting point for a comprehension of 
Sister Nivedita's work would be found in " The 
Web of Indian Life," published some ten years 
ago. But wherever one starts, one is brought 
into the presence of an interesting personality, 
which can be intimately comprehended by few 
western women and by still fewer western men. 
Moreover, one will get a glimpse of India 
through loving and glorifying eyes. 

Dr. Munson's book is decidedly above the 
average " missionary " book in vividness and 
interest. The chapters on well-known places 
such as Agra and Benares are far from strong, 
and might have been omitted without loss ; but 
when the author is dealing with her own daily 
life and work and observation, the pages are 
genuinely instructive. For instance, there is 
a glimpse straight at the heart of India in the 
story of the mother who had been frightfully 
bitten by her boy in the final terrible throes of 
hydrophobia. Dr. Munson begged the woman's 
friends to let her treat the wound, but they 
steadfastly refused, saying : " Why should she 
live ? Will there be aught in life for her when 
her only son is dead?" And there is some 
little revelation also in the writer's conclusion, 
" While my professional spirit urged me to save 
her life, my woman's heart told me they had 
spoken well." At times one is startled by per- 
fectly obvious errors, such as the intimation 
that the Jains all show Mongolian descent ; but 
the defects of the book still leave it distinctly 
worth while. 



The third volume on our list represents yet 
another point of view. The writer is an eminent 
Hindu lawyer and thinker, who has resided re- 
cently in England, and prior to that had spent 
several years at the great Moslem centre of 
Hyderabad. His avowed aim is the interpreta- 
tion of Indian sentiment to the British public 
for the mutual advantage of England and India ; 
and he impresses one as a clear and vigorous 
exponent of views honestly held. Naturally a 
cultured Hindu is still a Hindu, and our author's 
sympathies are obviously with the aristocracy of 
his own land rather than with the masses of the 
people or their rulers from overseas. But his 
observations and conclusions are none the less 
valuable when once his point of view has been 
noted. His large volume contains sixteen papers 
on such subjects as " The Hindu Drama," 
"British Statesmanship and Indian Psychology," 
" Indian Princes," " Industrial Development," 
and so forth. The least convincing chapters 
are perhaps those on " Hindu Medicine " and 
' ' Christianity in Hinduism . ' ' The 1 atter is simply 
an unsatisfying collection of parallels, more or 
less superficial, such as can be drawn between 
any two systems of religion. In the former, 
Mr. Mitra seems to maintain the superiority of 
the Hindu Kaviraj to the occidental specialist, 
and he claims a high level of hygiene at the basis 
of Hindu life. This chapter makes particularly 
interesting reading to one who has just risen 
from Dr. Munson's account of what she found 
in her medical work from day to day. 

For many readers, the most attractive sections 
will probably be those on "The Moslem- Hindu 
Entente Cordiale" and "The Indian Unrest." 
In the former Mr. Mitra claims that the followers 
of these two religions could go on living peace- 
fully and sanely side by side even if British 
control were withdrawn. In support of his 
contention he adduces his own experience as a 
lawyer representing the moslem government of 
Hyderabad, and the historical situation under 
the Mogul emperors when Hindus often rose to 
political and military eminence. Such a belief 
of the probable cordiality between the two great 
faiths is certainly worth considering; but with 
all deference to Mr. Mitra's authority, the re- 
viewer is unable to accept it as valid. On the 
topic of Indian unrest, our author largely rejects 
the conclusions of Sir Valentine Chirol, who holds 
the Brahmans responsible for most of the dis- 
content and practically all of its violent manifes- 
tations. Mr. Mitra denies that the Brahmans 
are primarily responsible, and comes out point- 
blank with the charge that "the arrogance of 



1913] 



527 



the low Europeans is the bed rock on which the 
citadel of sedition is built." " The so-called ad- 
ministrative ' reforms ' do not touch the masses, 
but the low European's kick touches the backs 
of the masses more than the English higher 
official classes can conceive." Again, he states : 
"Unrest is the consequence of racial hatred, 
arising from the conduct of some members of 
the dominant race." Obviously this is not an 
adequate explanation. But it does touch a real 
grievance, deserving more attention than it has 
received; and it may be said with confidence 
that ordinary politeness on the part of all 
Europeans, not merely on the part of the better 
Europeans, would go a long way toward lessen- 
ing the constant irritation. Unfortunately, 
recent letters from Calcutta make it clear that 
the evil is not on the wane ; and it is high time 
that the well-meaning British government took 
more vigorous steps to promote decency of de- 
portment, even in the lowest ranks of incoming 
Europeans. In any event, Mr. Mitra's com- 
plaint is timely, and may do good in this partic- 
ular connection, just as on the whole the essays 
that make up these "Anglo-Indian Studies" 
ought to serve a very useful purpose. 

It is difficult to close this notice without 
including a few paragraphs of a general nature 
dealing with the larger problems raised by these 
three divergent volumes ; but it has seemed pref- 
erable to use our limited space to indicate the 
more clearly the nature of the books themselves. 
And after all, it may easily turn out that the 
contrasts and contradictions we have suggested 
are in themselves the most significant comment 
on a number of the important questions that 
constantly thrust themselves at every intelligent 
reader who has once turned his eyes toward the 
most picturesque land in the world.

THE POETRY OF ANCIENT IRELAND.* 

Whatever may be thought a generation hence 
of the plays and poems of the Dublin school of 
to-day, there will be no doubt as to the perma- 
nent value of its scholarly accomplishments. 
The Celtic revivalists have introduced the 
English-speaking public to the great mass of 
their beautiful national legend and poetry which 
for centuries lay buried in Gaelic manuscripts 
scattered over Ireland. With an admirable 

*THE POEM-BOOK OF THE GAEL. Translations from 
Irish Gaelic Poetry into English Prose and Verse. Selected 
and edited by Eleanor Hull. Chicago: Browne &Howell Co. 



combination of exact method in dealing with 
their difficult material and of reverential zeal 
for the traditions of their ancestors, they have 
enthusiastically hunted out, edited, and trans- 
lated all the important relics of early Irish glory, 
and by so doing they have enriched the univer- 
sal store of beauty as well as added pride to an 
already noble history. 

The collection of poems made by Miss Eleanor 
Hull from the many volumes of work by these 
student patriots is in one respect the most satis- 
factory of the numerous similar anthologies 
published within the last decade, the range 
of material represented here is unusually wide 
and characteristic. There are some fine ex- 
amples of ancient pagan poetry, and there are 
a few nearly as lovely old Christian lyrics ; there 
are the nature songs of Ossian and his fellow 
minstrels, and the historic ballads "of the dark 
days " in Ireland ; there are folk songs, religious 
and secular, some from the twelfth century 
and some by our own contemporaries. The 
volume, in short, deserves its title, it is really 
a poem-book expressing from every facet the 
experiences of the Gael, and his moods. 

In an interesting Introduction, the editor tries 
to define the Irish temper and its varieties. 
She agrees with nearly all students in the field 
that as we read ancient Celtic literature we have 
a feeling of being "hung between two worlds, 
the seen and the unseen," and that the vivid- 
ness of the Gael's vision of the unseen always 
conditions his reading of the actualities about 
him. All of the best modern work shows this 
quality quite as clearly as the legends of Deirdre 
and Fionn and the race of semi-mythical heroes 
in the older world. Yeats and Synge, the 
first at times so involved in his own perceptions 
that he can scarcely distinguish a color from a 
thought, the second so sympathetic with the tem- 
perament that he is able to represent it in action 
with its results crowding upon it embarrassingly 
in a concrete modern environment, both these 
poets show all the marks of direct descent from 
the prehistoric bards. In the anthology before 
us there is every sign that in the long history 
outlined here, the continuity of this racial mood 
has been so complete as to unify ne of the most 
troubled experiences it has ever been a people's 
fortune to live through. 

From the poems in the volume it is difficult 
to select for quotation, the several examples are 
all so interesting. It is difficult to decide, for 
instance, whether the purely pagan poetry of 
the fairies, the magic charms easing the pains

of birth and death, the riddling invocations to 
the great nature powers, or the thinly Chris- 
tianized Psalter of Verses and Blessings and 
Hymns of the Saints, are the more significant 
of the most primitive phases of Irish belief. 
Perhaps pagan and Christian suggest after all 
a false antithesis, representing merely a differ- 
ence in the vocabulary which deals with the less 
understood elements in a puzzling universe. A 
better analysis would divide the poems accord- 
ing to the occasion for their conception, nature 
songs, life songs, etc. Of them all, the nature 
songs are the loveliest and the truest to the 
race's feeling for the world about it. Here is 
an example: 

"Take my tidings! 
Stags contend; 
Snows descend 
Summer's end ! 

"A chill wind raging; 
The sun low keeping, 
Swift to set 
O'er high seas weeping. 

" Dull red the fern; 
Shapes are shadows; 
Wild geese mourn 
O'er misty meadows. 

" Keen cold limes 
Each weaker wing. 
Icy times 
Such I sing! 

Take my tidings ! " 

The picture here is as objectively defined as 
that in the middle-English "Sumer is icumen 
in," except for the one subtle touch of "shapes 
are shadows," and the interpretation of the wild 
birds' cries, the distinguishing marks of the 
Celtic spirit. 

One more fine example of the pagan poetry, 
from the Poem- Book of Fionn, gives the inevi- 
table Stoicism of the hero in every age, with, 
again, just the slight difference in accent that is 
characteristic of the Irish voice. 

" Once I was yellow-haired, and ringlets fell 
In clusters round my brow; 

Grizzled and sparse to-night my short grey crop, 
No lustre in it now. 

" Better to me the shining locks of youth, 
Or raven's dusky hue, 

Than drear old age, which chilly wisdom brings, 
If what they say be true. 

" I only know that as I pass the road, 
No woman looks my way; 

They think my head and heart alike are cold, 
Yet I have had my day."

BOOKS OF TKAVEI* AND DESCRIPTION. 

New Zealand's wonders, in scenery, flora, fauna, 
human inhabitants, political arid social methods, 
industrial and commercial development, and general 
manners and customs, are treated with understand- 
ing and with a zealous enthusiasm for his theme 
by Mr. Paul Gooding in a lavishly illustrated volume 
entitled "Picturesque New Zealand" (Houghton). 
With many of the desirable characteristics of sunny 
Italy and beautiful Switzerland, and also of Utopia 
and El Dorado, the land depicted in Mr. Gooding's 
pages is certainly inviting in aspect. Its rainfall 
is mostly at night, so that the days are sunny, with 
some exceptions ; its climate is salubrious, the annual 
death rate being less than ten for each thousand 
inhabitants; and man's traditional inhumanity to 
man here loses its negative prefix. Wise law-givers 
have safeguarded the interests of both capital and 
labor, admirable land-tax and land-settlement regu- 
lations are in force, public utilities are owned by 
the people, old-age insurance makes comfortable the 
declining years of the poor, and, in short, if the New 
Zealander has anything to complain of, it must be 
the very monotony of well-being that it is his lot to 
enjoy. Such, at any rate, is the impression gained 
from reading about that favored land, which could 
hardly be more attractively and interestingly pic- 
tured than in Mr. Gooding's notable volume. 

Legend and ballad, history and description, anec- 
dote and literary allusion, with a wealth of graceful 
drawings by Mr. Hugh Thomson, go to make up the 
half- posthumous volume, "Highways and Byways in 
the Border " ( Macmillan), begun by the late Andrew 
Lang in collaboration with his brother John, and 
completed by the latter. In fact, the part attribut- 
able to the deceased collaborator is doubtless very 
much less than half, as one gathers from the preface; 
but his was probably the inspiration that set the work 
on foot, and we like to see touches of his genius in 
at least the earlier pages. Whatever the proportion 
of credit due to each, however, the book is a notable 
contribution to the lore of the ever-interesting Border 
which no one in our time has better known and loved 
than Andrew Lang. One reads with relish, detect- 
ing or suspecting the hand of the master (for cer- 
tainty is of course impossible), such stories as that of 
the dishonest butler of Billy Castle who "might, 
indeed, plume himself on his honesty, and say with 
Verges: 'I thank God I am as honest as any man 
living that is an old man and no honester than I.'" 
The abundant drawings, printed with the text, are 
excellent. 

The season's addition to Messrs. Winston's 
"Photogravure Series" is "French Canada and the 
St. Lawrence," by Mr. J. Castell Hopkins, an inter- 
esting historical and descriptive account of one 
phase of life in the Dominion. Quebec, with its 
surrounding territory, still remains the stronghold

of all that is typically French-Canadian, and its 
highly individualized life, wholesome in its rugged 
simplicity, must be considered, the author maintains, 
even now under British rule, an enriching element 
rather than a national problem for the Empire. 
Following the introductory topographical description 
and historical data are interpretive chapters on the 
customs, myths, religion, education, folk-lore, and 
literature of the French race in Canada. The life 
of the French Seigneur, now a passing type, is con- 
trasted with the equally picturesque existence of the 
habitant, dweller of the woodlands, described as an 
"industrious, contented, temperate, cheerful, devout, 
and patriotic man, sure of his Church, sure of Can- 
ada, sure of himself, but quite confidently doubtful 
of matters outside of these lines of thought." French 
Canada has remained a "country within a country"; 
its history has been eventful ; its scenery is un- 
equalled ; and its traditions are being zealously pre- 
served. The numerous illustrations in photogravure 
add charm and richness to the volume. 

The Rhine, the Danube, the Thames, the St. 
Lawrence, and other rivers have been made the 
subjects of travel-books pleasing to the reader and 
useful to the traveller; and now the chief river of 
France, the Loire, ^le fleuve national" furnishes 
Mr. Douglas Goldring with a subject for his hand- 
some volume, '-Along France's River of Romance" 
(McBride), in which personal narrative mingles 
entertainingly with descriptive and historical notes, 
all set off by an abundance of excellent drawings 
and water-color sketches. The artist modestly with- 
holds his name, nor does the title-page even hint that 
the book is illustrated a self-restraint that inclines 
a reviewer to give additional emphasis to his com- 
mendation of the well-executed pictures. The Loire's 
present comparative desolation and unnavigability, 
its devastating floods and frequent shoals, must be 
largely due to the deforestation of its water-shed, as 
might well have been pointed out in the author's 
descriptive and historical introduction. The course 
of the river takes one through many interesting 
places, even though the once numerous paquebots on 
its surface are now sadly dwindled, and the journey 
is accomplished less pleasantly than of old. 

'Mr. Charles Tower .considers the romance of the 
Rhine worn rather threadbare by excessive tourist 
traffic, and accordingly it is not that river of renown 
that figures in his book, "Along Germany's River of 
Romance" (McBride), but its less famous tributary, 
the Moselle. From Metz, near the French frontier, 
to Coblenz, at the confluence of the Moselle and the 
Rhine, he journeys down the picturesque stream, 
by boat on its waters or by bicycle along its banks, 
with occasional resort to that earliest and best mode 
of travel, walking. "The descent to the Rhine," he 
says, "is of the nature of an anticlimax; or, since it 
is scarcely sudden enough for that, it may perhaps 
better be called a heart-breaking staircase from the 
fairyland of dreams to the prosaic Alltag of the 
counting-house and the universal emporium." Never- 
theless the Rhine is the river of poetry and romance, 



of story and tradition, even though the lesser stream, 
as presented in Mr. Tower's pages, does offer much 
to excite interest and curiosity. Colored plates, 
half-tones, line drawings, and maps, with brief 
bibliography and a four-page index, go to make up 
the book's equipment. 

Mr. Horace Kephart, formerly in charge of the 
Mercantile Library, St. Louis, is the author of a 
book of mountaineering and exploration, '' Our 
Southern Highlanders," which is very attractively 
issued by the Outing Publishing Co. Comparatively 
little is known and still less has been written about 
the scattered dwellers in the vast mountain region 
extending nearly seven hundred miles in a south- 
western direction from Virginia to Alabama. Miss 
Morley's recent book, " The Carolina Mountains," 
calls attention to the beauties and the wonders of a 
part of that region ; and Mr. Kephart ably adds to 
the knowledge thus conveyed by describing in detail 
his adventures among the hardy mountaineers, their 
peculiar customs, native dialect, strange diseases, odd 
humors, family feuds, sturdy independence, and their 
manner of receiving "furriners," as all outsiders are 
called by them. Many illustrations, often from photo- 
graphs taken by the author, accompany the reading 
matter. 

A seven-months' voyage around the Horn in 
1845-6 is the subject of a book sure to find favor 
with those who like to read about old sailing days 
and old sailing ways. Mrs. Elizabeth Douglas Van 
Denburgh recounts her girlhood experit nue in accom- 
panying her father and mother, sister aiid brother, 
from Oswego, N. Y., to Honolulu on the occasion 
of the appointment of her father, Joel Turrill, as 
Consul General to the Sandwich Islands. "My 
Voyage in the U. S. Frigate 'Congress'" is the 
book's title, and the narrative is in diary form, with 
the touch of vividness and reality that such a method 
of writing, while the events are still fresh in the 
mind, is likely to impart. The long voyage was 
broken at Rio Janeiro, Valparaiso, and Lima, 
places that the reader is permitted to see through 
the diarist's eyes; and the rigors of the passage 
around the Horn are well described. The writer 
would have done wisely to break up her chronicle 
into chapters; a certain monotony results from its 
present arrangement, with no variation even of page- 
heading, and no sign-posts anywhere to catch the 
eye. Interesting illustrations are fortunately not 
lacking, and a cut of the "Congress" herself adorns 
the cover. (Desmond FitzGerald, Lie ) 

To find anything new to say about Japan in these 
days is difficult if not impossible; but it is always 
admissible to assume in one's readers a measure of 
ignorance as to things Japanese. At any rate, to 
tell of the country and the people as they appeared 
to the writer is not unlikely to convey some new 
impressions; and therefore "Japan as I Saw It" 
(Stokes), by Mr. A. H. Exner, has a certain fresh- 
ness that will secure it a reading, while its illustra- 
tions and other material details are such as to 
predispose one in its favor. A short preliminary

THE DIAI, 



[Dec. 16 



"History of Nippon," useful but not indispensable 
in this age of abundant encyclopaedias and other 
reference books, opens the book, and is followed by 
chapters on Nagasaki, Kioto, Yokohama, Tokio, 
and other places and subjects of interest, with con- 
siderable description of Japanese customs, religion, 
industries, amusements, and so on. Of the numerous 
illustrations accompanying the reading matter, some 
are "collotype plates," others are "engraving illus- 
trations after G. Bigot," and still others, being the 
majority of all. are "duo-tone illustrations." Beau- 
tifully-designed end-leaves and a pleasing cover are 
also among the book's attractions. 

Seeking to describe some of " those places that give 
England her individuality," Mr. Albert B. Osborne 
has prepared a volume of promising appearance 
under the title, "As It Is in England" (McBride), 
in which he wisely omits London as being " too vast 
and varied a subject to be combined with any other," 
and confines himself chiefly to such outlying parts 
as Cornwall and the Scilly Islands, Sherwood Forest, 
the Lake district, the Channel Islands, certain cathe- 
dral and other towns, and, very briefly, Oxford and 
Cambridge. His fifteen chapters are accompanied 
by fine views from photographs. His manner may 
be illustrated in the following brief excerpt from the 
chapter on Sherwood Forest: '-There was Alan-a- 
Dale and Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet, and they were 
brave, and not of a bad sort at heart, but different than 
you and I will ever know, for while human nature is 
still the same, yet the laws and customs we call our 
civilization have wrought upon us a necessary work 
of suppression and restraint so that we do not mani- 
fest our nature in just the same way." The British 
lion and unicorn fittingly adorn the handsome cover, 
and a box encloses the book. 

The sights of London are many and varied, and 
are every year increasing in multitude and variety. 
Consequently an author should have little difficulty 
in filling a moderate-sized volume on the great me- 
tropolis with chapters of a readable and generally 
informing character. Mr. Henry James Forman's 
"London: An Intimate Picture" (McBride) is the 
work of a well-informed and observant sojourner in 
the city which he calls "the most romantic spot on 
earth." The lure of London, its atmosphere, its fam- 
ous Tower, ita historic streets, its churches, picture- 
galleries, and other public buildings, are among the 
subjects intelligently discussed in successive chap- 
ters; and occasional views from photographs help the 
reader to follow his guide. Incidentally, a perilous 
state of affairs is thought by the author to be indi- 
cated in a national legislature "mildly debating 
upon Welsh Disestablishment" while "in every 
street there is poverty and misery stabbing at your 
heart." 

Something out of the ordinary in hunting narra- 
tives is offered by Mr. Thomas Martindale, a Nim- 
rod of experience and a writer of interesting books 
of sport. " Hunting in the Upper Yukon " (Jacobs) 
describes a trip in quest of big game to the far North 



of our continent in the autumn of 1912, and the 
author's varied and sometimes perilous experiences 
are set forth in ample detail, but not wearisomely 
to the reader with a taste for such things. Human 
beings as well as animals attracted Mr. Martindale's 
attention throughout his expedition, and therefore 
the human interest so craved by us all is not lack- 
ing in his book. A mountain and a glacier bearing 
each the name of this intrepid huntsman and ex- 
plorer are among the scenes pictured in the many 
illustrations to the volume. One chapter is deserv- 
edly devoted to that intrepid mountain-climber, Miss 
Dora Keen, "the conqueror of Mount Blackburn." 
Mr. Martindale's style as a narrator is intimate 
and pleasing, and his book has a very inviting ap- 
pearance. 

History, antiquities, topography, botany, scenery, 
legends, literary associations, things ancient and 
things modern, all have a place in Mr. Frederic 
Lees's "Wanderings on the Italian Riviera" (Little, 
Brown & Co.), a handsomely-made volume, with 
the clearest of type and most generous supply of 
photo-engravings, also a colored frontispiece. Few 
of the Riviera's winter sojourners have more than a 
faint knowledge of " the splendid story of the prov- 
ince which gave birth to Columbus, and where the 
immortal Dante wandered," as Mr. Lees remarks. 
Accordingly he has given much attention to the 
history of the region, especially to the valleys of 
Liguria and the picturesque hill-towns tucked away 
in the folds of the mountains. Appended notes on 
the botany of Liguria add to the book's value for 
naturalists ; and it also has a map and a full index. 

Mr. George Hamilton Fitch's twin volumes, "The 
Critic in the Orient" and "The Critic in the Occi- 
dent" (Paul Elder & Co.), take their titles from the 
fact that their author brings to the observation of 
things in the Far East and the Near West the keen- 
ness of scrutiny developed by thirty years of book- 
reviewing for the San Francisco " Chronicle." Hav- 
ing learned how to tear the heart out of a new book 
and display it for the benefit of hurried newspaper- 
readers, he is not ill qualified for the task of seizing 
quickly upon the significant and the striking in 
scenes of foreign travel. Japan, Hongkong, Canton, 
Singapore, Manila, cities of India and monuments 
of Egypt, furnish matter for the first-named of his 
travel-books; and Europe, from the isles of Greece 
westward, especially the cities of Rome, Paris, and 
London, with a brief glance at New York on the 
homeward journey, provides topics of general inter- 
est for the second. Tinted illustrations from photo- 
graphs abound. Indebtedness is acknowledged to 
the "Chronicle" for permission to republish these 
chapters of travel. Like other works from the same 
publishers, these volumes are distinctive in appear- 
ance and artistic in design. 

To the literature of the Alps is added Mr. Archi- 
bald Campbell Knowles's anecdotal and descriptive 
volume entitled "Adventures in the Alps" (Jacobs). 
Though it has not on every page the personal quality 



1913] 



THE DIAL

that renders so enjoyable Mr. Frederic Harrison's 
"My Alpine Jubilee," Sir Leslie Stephen's "The 
Playground of Europe," and Mr. Whymper's 
"Scrambles Amongst the Alps," it is full of things 
seen, dangers escaped, and adventures met with, by 
actual mountain-climbers, including the author him- 
self. Reflections of a serious and often of a relig- 
ious nature find natural expression in this book 
dealing with the sublimities of Alpine scenery. Its 
twelve chapters are furnished with as many half- 
tone views from photographs, and the whole is in- 
stinct with the lure of the mountains. 

Travel sketches from the Mediterranean shores 
of Africa, written at various times in the last half- 
dozen years, and already, with three exceptions, 
offered to appreciative readers in a leading period- 
ical, form the contents of Mr. Albert Edwards's 
anecdotal and descriptive volume on " The Barbary 
Coast" (Macmillan), in which it is the people them- 
selves, the turbaned and veiled followers of the 
Prophet, that claim our attention, and usually suc- 
ceed in winning it. Algiers, the sirocco, the 
Bedouins, the Arabs, the beggars, the graces and 
charms of the women these and like themes suc- 
cessively entertain the reader, and numerous illus- 
trations from the trustworthy camera fail not to do 
their part. One of the strangest characters of all 
the strange company is Hadje Mohmed of Luna 
Park, of whom there is no room here to speak 
further. The book's inviting appearance does not 
belie its character. 

Mr. Earle Harrison's noteworthy autochrome 
photographs of the Panama Canal which were last 
summer reproduced in "Scribner's Magazine" are 
now shown in book form under the title, "The 
Panama Canal" (Moffat). Seventeen in number, 
the views convey an adequate impression of the 
wonders of this greatest of engineering achieve- 
ments, and give also glimpses of the adjacent 
country, Gatun Lake, the Chagres River, and the 
vastness of the Culebra Cut. The book will gain 
rather than lose in interest and value when many 
of the scenes it shows shall have been forever 
shut out from view by the inrushing waters. Few 
better examples of color-photography have been 
published. 

Ten years have passed since the appearance of 
the first edition of Mr. Douglas Sladen's " Queer 
Things about Japan," and the book has since been 
twice re-issued. Now a fourth edition comes out, 
with an added chapter on the life of the late Japan- 
ese Emperor. Native artists illustrate the volume 
with pictures as charactistic and as guiltless of per- 
spective as could be desired. The frontispiece is in 
color and gives a glimpse of rural Japan in cherry- 
blossom time. As a sketch-book of the humors and 
oddities of the people of Nippon, Mr. Sladen's volume 
is entertaining and apparently at the same time heed- 
ful of the truth. He has collected in his five hundred 
pages a goodly store of anecdote and observation, 
comment and description. (Button.) 



HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

Mr. Keith Henderson's ten colored illustrations 
to the new holiday edition of Mr. Thomas Hardy's 
"Under the Greenwood Tree" (Putnam) have a 
vividness in their rural hues that emphasizes the 
fact that this is a picture of primitive country life, 
" a rural painting of the Dutch school " the author 
styled it in his sub- title. It is nearly forty- two 
years since this earliest pronounced success of Mr. 
Hardy's or, more accurately, one of his earliest 
successes made its appearance, and it has lost 
none of its excellence with time. Miss Fancy Day, 
the heroine, "as nate a little figure of fun as ever I 
see, and just husband-high," is as charming as ever, 
and the bucolic humor of the tale is still unsur- 
passed. The book's wide-margined and clearly- 
printed pages are irresistibly inviting. 

Nothing short of splendid is the form in which 
"Poems from Leaves of Grass" (Dutton), illus- 
trated in color by Miss Margaret C. Cook, is pre- 
sented to the reader. The book is a quarto of two 
hundred and sixty pages, its typography and paper 
beyond criticism, its cover design an appropriate 
representation of grass blades and heads in gilt on 
a green background, and its two dozen large colored 
plates catching the mood of the poet without becom- 
ing so realistic as to offend. Whitman's poems must 
be reproduced here in greater part a brief com- 
parison will easily determine the omissions and 
a more elaborate reproduction could not reasonably 
be desired. An ornate and serviceable box, with 
hinged cover, encloses the book. 

"The Gathering of Brother Hilarius," by the late 
author of "The Roadmender," best known by her 
pen name of "Michael Fairless," reappears this sea- 
son in a handsome holiday edition, with eight sym- 
pathetic illustrations by Miss Eleanor F. Bric.kdale. 
The book teaches the lesson that one must suffer and 
be tempted and overcome temptation before one can 
attain fulness of life and spiritual peace. Hilarius, 
a young novice, yielding suddenly one day to the 
promptings of youth and the lure of the road passing 
the monastery gate, ventures forth a little way and 
meets a dancing girl who laughs at him for never 
having known either hunger or love. But the mean- 
ing of these words he learns full well somewhat later 
when, after confessing his escapade, he is sent forth 
into the world by the prior and meets with sundry 
adventures that serve to test the stuff he is made of. 
His final return to the monastery, his rare skill as 
a limner, his good works as prior, his death, and 
his " gathering " to his last long rest, are beautifully 
told. (Dutton.) 

A new edition of Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson's 
"Ramona" (Little, Brown & Co.), with an intro- 
duction by Mr. A. C. Vrornan, who gives the his- 
tory of the writing of the story and correctly places 
its scene, is among the more important reprints of 
the season. Conflicting reports as to the scene of 
the famous incidents of the romance have long been 
current, to the confusion of tourists, and Mr. Vro- 



532

man's carefully-studied paper on the subject is far 
from superfluous. He has also provided the book 
with twenty-four views from his own photographs, 
and Mr. Henry Sandham supplies appropriate 
drawings for the chapter-headings. The work is 
issued as two volumes in one, artistically bound and 
neatly boxed. 

The handy form, the good paper, the clear though 
not large type, and especially the sixteen colored 
illustrations by Mr. Christopher Clark, make the 
Crowell Company's new edition of Blackmore's 
"Lorna Doone" a desirable one to possess. .The 
author's preface to the first and that to the sixth 
edition are reprinted. A pleasing scene, showing 
the hero and heroine literally tete-h-tete, adorns the 
cover ; a similarly ornamented wrapper is provided, 
and the whole is neatly boxed. 

HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

One of the most sumptuous of the season's art 
books is a thin quarto devoted to the life and work 
of Charles Conder, a young English artist who died 
some four years ago. Although he worked con- 
stantly in oils, and attempted lithography and etch- 
ing, Conder's forte lay in water-color drawing on 
silk. In this field, more especially in his designs 
for fans, he achieved a very high reputation. His 
fans, as Mr. Charles Ricketts has said, will some day 
be considered classics. Here his poetic imagination 
and exquisite sense of color reached their fullest 
expression, with results that are often strongly remi- 
niscent of Wattean. Mr. Frank Gibson contributes 
an account of Conner's li e and work, and a descriptive 
catalogue of his lithographs and etchings is supplied 
by Mr. Campbell Dodgson. The greater part of the 
volume, however, is given over to illustrative fea- 
tures. Besides a photogravure portrait of the artist, 
there are considerably more than a hundred full- 
page reproductions of his work, including eleven 
fine color-plates. In all matters of external appear- 
ance, the publishers (Lane) have given the volume 
an irreproachable setting. Conder himself would 
have rejoiced in the beautiful cover and end-leaves. 

A splendid souvenir of the art of those Russian 
dancers who have lately performed so acceptably 
in Germany, France, England, and America, is 
presented in Mr. A. E. Johnson's finely-illustrated 
quarto on "The Russian Ballet" (Houghton). An 
introductory historical sketch of the ballet opens the 
book, seventeen pantomimes, tableaux, reveries, and 
similar pieces performed by Russian dancers are 
described and illustrated, and the final chapter is 
devoted to that queen of the ballet, Mile. Anna 
Pavlova. Mr. Rene" Bull admirably catches the 
spirit of Russian stage dancing in his vivid illustra- 
tions in color and his equally pleasing line drawings. 
Bound in white and gold, and artistically boxed, 
the book takes an important place among recent 
works of like character. 

No English celebrity, not of the royal family, 
can count on being spared by Mr. Max Beerbohm in 
his quest of subjects for the exercise of his talent as 



the cleverest of present-day caricaturists; and even 
foreign notables find themselves included in his 
album of laughable portraits and made the invol- 
untary promoters of international gayety. " Fifty 
Caricatures by Max Beerbohm" (Dutton) is a book 
to dispel the blues, being a collection of half a hun- 
dred of the artist's most characteristic extravaganzas 
in portraiture. Politics, literature, society, high fi- 
nance, reformed spelling, with much else beside (but 
not including woman suffrage, for some unknown 
reason), are represented in the mirth-provoking 
figures that enliven the book. One notable drawing 
shows us Hilda Lessways upbraiding the author of 
her being for compelling her and Clayhanger to 
remain on public exhibition for so protracted and 
indefinite a period. Clayhanger, with an injured 
look, stands in the background. The cover-design 
pictures John Bull in amusing guise. 

Eugene Fromentin's book of art criticism, "Les 
Maitres d'Autrefois," produced near the end of his 
life, almost forty years ago, comes out in a good 
English translation entitled "The Masters of Past 
Time" (Dutton), with four reproductions in color, 
and twice as many in half-tone, from those masters. 
It is with the Dutch and the Flemish schools that 
the book deals, and its method is thus explained by 
the author: ''I shall merely describe, in the presence 
of certain pictures, the effects of surprise, pleasure, 
astonishment, and no less exactly of disappointment, 
which they happened to cause me." Rubens, Rem- 
brandt, Frans Hals, Van Dyck, Paul Potter, Ter- 
burg, Ruysdael, Cuyp these are naturally treated 
at some length by the artist-author, through whose 
eyes it is pleasant and instructive to view the mas- 
terpieces of Dutch and Flemish art. The translator 
modestly withholds his name. 

The art of the Cubists, "the joy of the mad, the 
despair of the sane,'' is amusingly and very cleverly 
satirized in verse and drawing by Mr. and Mrs. 
Earl Harvey Lyall in the oddest little color book 
of the season, < The Cubies' ABC" (Putnam). 
Mrs. Lyall writes the verses, Mr. Lyall cubically 
illustrates them. The book must be seen and read 
to be appreciated, but here is a sample of its literary 
style (its artistic quality defies description) : 

"A is for Art in the Cubies' domain 

(Not the Art of the Ancients, brand-new are the Cubies.) 
Archipenko's their guide, Anatomies their bane ; 
They 're the joy of the mad, the despair of the sane, 

(With their emerald hair and their eyes red as rubies.) 
A is for Art in the Cubies' domain." 

A little book designed to awaken a primary inter- 
est in some of the great artists and their paintings is 
Miss Effie Seachrest's "Legendary Lore and Peeps 
at Pictures," in which Raphael, Reynolds, Nicholaas 
Maes, Puvis de Chavannes, Boutet de Morivel, and 
a few others, are briefly and simply treated, with 
accompanying prints, in miniature, of some of their 
more celebrated paintings. The story element is 
made prominent, and the book ought to interest 
young readers (though one never can tell before- 
hand), who will at least enjoy its pictures. "The

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

The recent death of that industrious and enthu- 
siastic antiquary and historian, Stephen Jenkins, 
adds a melancholy interest to his last work, "The 
Old Boston Post Road " (Putnam), which traces 
with an ample accompaniment of historical comment 
the oldest and most northerly of the mail routes 
connecting New York and Boston in colonial times. 
By this route, via New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, 
and Worcester, a monthly mail was established in 
1673, " the first mail upon the continent of America," 
as the author declares. The plan of the book is 
similar to that of "The Greatest Street in the 
World," from the same pen, the notes and comments 
and pictorial illustrations being of the most copious 
and variously interesting sort. About a third of the 
volume is devoted to the route from New York to 
the Connecticut line, in the region of the author's 
home and most painstaking researches ; but no part 
of the road is slighted, and the account runs to nearly 
four hundred and fifty octavo pages. Pictures, maps, 
bibliography, and index are all fittingly supplied. 
Especially noteworthy are the two hundred well- 
chosen illustrations from both early and later 
sources. 

"Thomas Jefferson as an Architect and a De- 
signer of Landscapes" is the arresting title of a 
handsome and otherwise remarkable volume, the 
joint work of Professor William Alexander Lambeth, 
of the University of Virginia, and Mr. Warren H. 
Manning, landscape-designer, of Boston. Monticello 
and the university that Jefferson helped to found are 
made the objects of expert scrutiny in determining, 
so far as may be, how much the allied arts of archi- 
tecture and landscape-design owe to the versatile 
third president of our country. Letters and other 
documents from his hand, some of them reproduced 
in facsimile, help to establish his claim to our 
admiration for his skill in the arts here referred to. 
Palladio, who gave inspiration to Inigo Jones, was 
also, it seems, a stimulus to Jefferson; but the 
distinguishing blemishes of Palladio's style were 
avoided by his Virginian disciple, whose conceptions, 
we are assured, "became increasingly refined and 
classical." The authors of the book have pursued 
their researches with enthusiasm, and what they 
have to say is presented in convincing form. The 
work is handsomely issued in a limited edition, 
with many plates and other illustrative accessories, 
and with a beautiful cover-design showing the front 
elevation of Monticello. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 

Appropriately supplementary to Mr. Stanton 
Davis Kirkham's "East and West," of recent date, 
is his similar volume entitled "North and South" 
(Putnam) an intensive rather than extensive 
study of nature in a few chosen places of the higher 
and the lower latitudes of our broad country, all 
enlivened with a genial humor and embellished with 
innumerable views of field and forest and rippling 



stream. No small part of the joy of such outings 
as Mr. Kirkham delights in is depicted in these 
words of his : " But at Pine Bank I throw off this 
yoke of tyranny and am not concerned about the 
dinner or the vagaries of the cook, or even the style 
of my coat, since bacon and potatoes and beans are 
as constant and as dependable as day and night, 
and a flannel shirt is always the fashion." Mr. 
Kirkham is a close and loving student of nature. 

An album of fine views and plans of "The Old 
Halls and Manor Houses of Yorkshire" (Scribner), 
with a sufficiency of descriptive text, is presented by 
Mr. Louis Ambler, who confesses himself embar- 
rassed with an excess of riches in choosing examples 
for his book. Only houses built before 1700 have 
been selected, and those built for defense, and there- 
fore having the nature of castles, are excluded. 
Ninety-one plates from photographs taken especially 
for this work by Mr. Horace Dan, architect, and 
others, with twenty plates of measured drawings and 
numerous illustrations in the text, adorn the royal 
octavo, which is sumptuously bound in green and gilt. 
Mr. Ambler is himself an architect, and his book will 
appeal especially to those of his profession. The 
illustrations are remarkably good, often strikingly 
beautiful. 

Miss Helene A. Guerber, a practiced hand at 
such work, has gathered into one compact volume 
brief outlines of the world's great epics, including 
those of Asia as well as of Europe, and closing with 
a short chapter on American productions of an epic 
quality. "The Book of the Epic" (Lippincott) has 
an introduction by Dr. J. Berg Esenwein, sixteen 
reproductions of famous paintings and old prints, 
aud a full index of names. In the right hands it 
will serve as a powerful promoter of a love of what 
is best in the great department of literature that it 
discusses. A simple, straightforward, narrative style 
has been adopted by the author, whose success in 
packing so much excellent matter into so small space 
is to be commended. 

Descriptive of the French capital from Caesar's 
time to the present, Mrs. Mabel S. C. Smith's 
"Twenty Centuries of Paris" (Crowell) is a conven- 
ient and readable handbook for those who wish to 
know the wonderful city in a topographical-historical 
way. Old prints and modern photographs contribute 
to the illustration of the book, a folding map of the 
city is inserted, and genealogical tables of the kings 
of France down to the Revolution, with a chrono- 
logical list of the subsequent heads of the nation, are 
appended. It is a fascinating theme that the author 
has chosen, and she draws occasionally on the poets 
to heighten the charm. Her closing chapter on 
"Paris of To-day" has a self-denying brevity that 
speaks well for the writer's ability to hold her super- 
abundance of material well in hand from the begin- 
ning. The book is handsomely bound, and its large 
type refreshes the eye. 

The fifth of the so-called " Sayings of Jesus " that 
were discovered six years ago written on a fragment 
of papyrus is the theme of Dr. Henry van Dyke's 



534 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



poetic apologue, "The Toiling of Felix" (Scribner). 
After long and devout search the saintly Felix found 
Jesus in the humble toil of a quarry-man, thus prov- 
ing the truth of the saying, "Raise the stone and 
thou shalt find me; cleave the wood and there am 
I." Colored plates by Mr. Herbert Moore illustrate 
the poem, and decorative designs by Mr. Edward B. 
Edwards border the pages and illuminate the cover. 
It is a beautiful legend, beautifully told, and finely 
suited to the Christmas season. 

Designed in the style made familiar by its pub- 
lishers, Messrs. Paul Elder & Co., a stout volume with 
numerous pictures from photographs, and bearing 
the title, " The Old Spanish Missions of California," 
conducts the reader through the more or less ruinous 
remains of the twenty-one religious establishments 
that testify to the zeal of Spain in carrying the 
Christian faith to our southwestern aborigines. The 
mission of San Diego de Alcala" was founded in 
1769, that of San Francisco Solano in 1823 ; and 
between these years the starting of the other missions 
took place at short intervals. Mr. Paul Elder sup- 
plies brief historical and descriptive sketches to 
accompany the many fine illustrations, and quotes 
freely from other writers, both in prose and verse. 
The book is artistic in design, and a pleasing con- 
tribution to the literature that has grown up about 
these picturesque old mission houses. 

The identity of "George A. Birmingham" being 
now revealed, he is to be spoken of by reviewers as 
Rev. James Owen Hannay, though his delightful 
pictures of Irish life will always be associated with 
the more familiar pen-name in his readers' minds. 
" Irishmen All " (Stokes) is much after the manner 
of last year's book by the same author, " The Lighter 
Side of Irish Life," being a collection of twelve 
character sketches of officials, country gentlemen, 
farmers, squires, priests, the exile from Erin, the 
"minister," and, lastly, the young lady and the 
young gentleman in business. Each of the twelve 
selected types is graphically and chromatically 
exhibited by Mr. Jack B. Yeats, R.H.A., as well 
as painted in words by the author. The appropri- 
ate green binding is protected by a wrapper on 
which is pictured the priest going the rounds of his 
parish. 

"The Changing Year" (Crowell) is an excellent 
anthology of nature verse compiled by Mr. John R. 
Howard. It departs from the usual and the expected 
method of such compilations in not following the 
order of the seasons, but in grouping its selections 
under headings denoting aspects and moods. Thus, 
"Light and Shadow," "Sky and Air, "Man's 
Fellow Creatures," "The Mighty Heart," are some 
of its section-titles. The realm of English and 
American poetry has been searched for suitable 
selections, and an occasional poet of alien tongue is 
represented in translation. An index of authors 
and titles, and one of first lines, with a brief intro- 
duction and a hauntingly beautiful winter scene as 
frontispiece, complete the equipment of the little 
book, which is tastefully bound and boxed. 



Mr. Walt Mason, favorably known to magazine- 
readers as a writer of prose- verse, or jingles in the 
form of prose, is the author of a lively and amusing 
book entitled, "Rippling Rhymes" (McClurg), 
wherein are collected about a hundred pieces, new 
compositions and reprints, on all sorts of timely 
themes, and enjoying the distinguished sponsorship 
of our Secretary of State, who writes a heartily 
commendatory introduction. Mr. D. S. Groesbeck 
contributes half a dozen clever drawings in har- 
mony with the spirit of the volume, which bears a 
medallion portrait of the author on its cover, and 
is otherwise embellished. As a sample of Mr. 
Mason's style, we quote: "Be kind to the umpire 
who bosses the game, whose doom is too frequently 
sealed; it serves no good purpose to camp on his 
frame, and strew him all over the field." One 
might do worse than read good verse set up in the 
form of prose ; 't is not its look makes the poetry- 
book, nor its name that makes the rose. 

Mr. Berton Braley's "Sonnets of a Suffragette" 
(Browne & Howell Co.) is timely in its theme and 
tuneful in its smoothly-flowing verse. " Rollicking " 
is perhaps a better adjective to apply to the lively 
bits of rhyme gathered together in the little volume, 
which contains, beside the pieces indicated in the 
title, sundry love sonnets of a manicure, love lyrics 
of a shop girl, and love lyrics of a chauffeur. An 
almost enviable command of colloquialisms, great 
dexterity in their manipulation in verse, and a 
fertile invention, are evident on every page of the 
lively little book. It is certainly calculated to dis- 
pel care, smooth the ruffled brow, and induce a 
mirthful state of mind befitting the season. 

The gently satirical, pleasingly whimsical, not too 
boisterously comical muse of Mr. Bert Leston Taylor, 
the "B. L. T." of the Chicago "Tribune," will be 
enjoyed by readers of his "Motley Measures," a vol- 
ume of modest proportions and not making promise 
of more than it can carry out. Most of the verses 
have already seen the light in the "Tribune," but 
will stand the strain of reprinting. We especially 
welcome the neat little skit entitled "Bygones: 
Lines Inspired by a View of the Cubist Paintings, 
Followed by a Late Supper." But the whole book 
is a capital smile-generator. The author's portrait 
appears as frontispiece. The Laurentian Publish- 
ers, of Chicago, issue the book. 

That an excellent anthology of poetry and prose 
on the pleasures of open-air life can be made even 
with the omission of more than one eminent writer 
in that domain, is proved by Mr. John Richardson, 
the compiler of a handy and attractive volume 
entitled "In the Garden of Delight" (Caldwell). 
In all the wealth of its well-chosen contents we find 
nothing from Thoreau, nothing from Bryant but a 
line printed under the frontispiece, nothing from 
Whitman or Gilbert White or Richard Jefferies. 
But we do find enough, and more than enough, to 
warrant commendation of the book, which is taste- 
fully made, with a delicately beautiful colored plate 
facing the title-page, and a pleasing cover design.

THE DIAL,

A wholesome Christmas story, with an obvious 
but not too obtrusive moral, comes from the pen of 
Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright. "The Stranger at 
the Gate" (Macmillan) relates sundry interesting 
experiences of the Vance family and of a rather 
mysterious Dr. Amunde who is engaged in a study 
of "the modern spirit of Christmas as it is lived in 
the homes of our best eastern civilization." Inter- 
woven with the narrative is the moving account of 
old Ira Vance's long-delayed success as an inventor, 
and the founding of the firm of "Ira & Elizabeth 
Vance & Son." A happy ending suitably and sat- 
isfyingly closes the pleasant story. A colored front- 
ispiece arid occasional decorative designs in green 
contribute to the book's attractive appearance. 

A pleasing and useful desk accessory takes the 
shape of a neatly encased "Hourly Reminder," in 
which each day of the year has a leaf to itself with 
blank lines for every hour from nine in the morning 
to ten at night. Engagements are to be written on 
these lines and each leaf detached when it has per- 
formed its office. Apt quotations and notes of 
historic events are supplied, as is also an appendix 
of useful information. Two styles of case are offered, 
in " leatherette " and in Spanish morocco. (W. N. 
Sharpe Co.) 

Nine Christmas tales for the young in heart call 
for commendatory mention, but must receive less 
than their due of critically appreciative comment. 
"The Lady of the Lighthouse" (Doran), by Mrs. 
Lewis B. Woodruff, justifies its pleasingly allitera- 
tive title by showing, in the form of a bright and 
sunshiny story, how light may be brought into the 
lives of the blind. At the same time it is a Christ- 
mas story of unusual quality. "The Three God- 
fathers" (Doran) carries the reader to a very 
different environment, the plains of Arizona. The 
author is Mr. Peter B. Kyne, and he tells the story 
of a Christmas baby in such a manner as to hold 
the attention at the same time that it teaches a les- 
son. "Finding His Soul" (Harper), by Mr. Nor- 
man Duncan, tells how James Falcontent, of the 
business house of Groat & McCarthy, beheld a 
vision in the hills of Bethlehem, and found his soul 
and was at peace. Illustrations help to make vivid 
the moving tale. In "Next Christmas" (Browne 
& Howell Co.) Mr. Byron E. Veatch relates briefly 
and effectively how a hardened business man is at 
last led to return from the West to his boyhood 
home in New Hampshire, where he finds his old- 
time sweetheart still waiting for him, and the 
two are married. Mrs. Josephine Daskam Bacon 
chronicles in her own bright way "The Luck o' 
Lady Joan" (Browne & Howell Co.), in which a 
poor tinker's daughter is adopted by an old miser, 
marries his grandson, and so, all in good time, 
attains prosperity and also happiness. A frontis- 
piece depicts the marriage scene, and the cover 
shows Joan at her spinning-wheel. "A Christmas 
When the West Was Young" (McClurg), by Dr. 
Cyrus Townsend Brady, is the story of a young 
couple who remove from New England to the far 



West, build themselves a log cabin forty miles from 
the nearest settlement, have a child born to them, 
and see it taken from them by death two days 
before Christmas. But on Christmas day, through 
a stirring and rather fearful series of events, 
another child finds itself under their care and claim- 
ing their love, which is given, after some hesitation ; 
and so the peace and joy of the season are still in 
a measure theirs. Drawings and decorations enrich 
the little book, which is ornamentally bound and 
boxed. "Under the Christmas Stars" (Double- 
day) depicts an old-fashioned family gathering at 
Christmas time under the family roof at North 
Estabrook, where John Fernald and his wife wel- 
come their numerous progeny, including sons-in-law, 
daughters-in-law, and grand-children, and Christmas 
merry-making rises to high-water mark. The latest 
addition to the family, through marriage, is somewhat 
snubbed as being "a wild and woolly Westerner, "but 
she proves herself the heroine of the occasion. How 
she does it should be read in the very words of the 
author, Miss Grace S. Richmond. It is an unusual 
plot. Alice Barber Stephens illustrates the book, 
which also has marginal decorations and other 
artistic embellishments. An amusing and pathetic 
tale of the reunion of an aged husband and wife, 
who had been settled in different homes of the 
family circle, but at last determined to elope back 
to the little old house where they had formerly been 
happy, is told in Mrs. Caroline Abbot Stanley's 
Yuletide romance, "Their Christmas Golden Wed- 
ding" (Crowell), which is illustrated in color. 
"The Christmas Bishop" (Small, Maynard & Co.), 
by Miss Winifred Kirkland, shows us a generous- 
hearted dignitary of the Church endeavoring on the 
last day of his life, which happens to be Christmas, 
to reconcile an unforgiving woman to her daughter- 
in-law, to make a fashionable clergyman adopt a 
simple and sincere life amongst the poor, and a 
lonely rich woman win happiness by helping the 
clergyman in the proposed good work. How far he 
succeeded the book will tell. It is illustrated by 
Miss Louise G. Morrison. 



NOTES. 



Mr. Dean C.Worcester has in preparation an extended 
work on the Philippines, which the Macmillan Co. will 
publish during the winter. 

A new volume of verse by Mr. Richard Le Gallienne, 
entitled " The Lonely Dancer, and Other Poems," will 
be published immediately by the John Lane Co. 

An addition to the list of Houghton Mifflin books, to 
be published at once, is Mr. Arthur Grant's " In the Old 
Paths," a series of essays recreating some of the great 
scenes of literature. 

One of the earliest novels of the new year will be 
"Idonia: A Romance of Old London," by Mr. Arthur 
F. Wallis, a new English writer. Messrs. Little, Brown 
& Co. are the publishers. 

This is the last holiday season in which we shall have 
one of the late Andrew Lang's famous fairy books. This 



536 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



year's volume, the twenty-fifth of the series, is entitled 
"The Strange Fairy Book." Like most of its prede- 
cessors, it is illustrated in color, etc., by Mr. H. J. Ford. 
Mr. George Middleton has written a new three-act 
play entitled " Nowadays," which Messrs. Holt will pub- 
lish early in the new year. It is described as a comedy 
of family life and feminism. 

Mr. Charles Welsh, who has for many years made a 
special study of literature for the young, is engaged on 
a volume of " Studies in the History of Children's Lit- 
erature," which will be published early next year. 

" The Poetical Works of William Blake," edited, with 
introduction and textual notes, by Mr. John Sampson, 
is soon to be added to the " Oxford Poets." The vol- 
ume includes the unpublished " French Revolution." 

Professor Frederic A. Ogg, whose Life of Daniel 
Webster is promised for publication early in January 
by Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co., has recently been 
selected to deliver a course of lectures on Contemporary 
Government and Politics under the auspices of the Inter- 
collegiate Commission on Extension Courses, in Boston. 
The December number of "Poetry" contains six 
narrative poems by the Bengal poet, Rabindranath 
Tagore, who has recently been awarded the Nobel Prize 
in literature. Mr. Tagore's work was introduced to 
American audiences by " Poetry " in the December num- 
ber of last year. These new poems have been translated 
from the Bengali by the author expressly for this pub- 
lication, and they are said to represent a new phase of 
his work. 

According to the London " Nation," we are to have 
a book upon art by Rodin. It seems that for a long 
time past the famous sculptor has been in the habit of 
jotting down notes about his own art, the art of the 
past, and his general views of {esthetics. These are now 
to be edited for publication by Rodin in collaboration 
with Mr. Warrington Dawson, an American writer whom 
he has known for several years. The book is to appear 
in French early next year, and will be promptly followed 
by an English translation. 

A collection of three plays by the Viennese dramatist, 
Arthur Schnitzler, in an English translation by Mr. 
Horace B. Samuel, is announced by Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. So far Schnitzler is known to English- 
speaking readers and playgoers chiefly through Mr. 
Granville Barker's adaptation of his series of episodes 
entitled " Anatol." The three plays to be issued in this 
volume, "The Green Cockatoo," "The Mate," and 
"Paracelsus,"however, give the English reader excellent 
opportunity to estimate Sehnitzler at his true value. 

High on the list of the really important American 
magazines of a serious character stand the quarterlies 
which appear under the auspices of certain of our uni- 
versities. They come nearer than any other periodicals 
to satisfying the wants of the educated reader, just as 
those wants are satisfied in England by the great 
monthlies and quarterlies. We have no magazines 
worthier of support, or better repaying their modest 
subscription price, than " The Sewanee Review," " The 
South Atlantic Quarterly," and " The Yale Review," 
to which list must now be added " The Mid- West 
Quarterly," which comes from the University of 
Nebraska. Mr. P. H. Frye is the editor, and the con- 
tents of the initial (October) number are of rich and 
varied interest. The magazine offers its hospitality to 
writers from all sections of the country. The Messrs. 
Putnam give it their imprint.

The Works of Vitruvius 

Translated by the late Morris H. Morgan, Ph.D., 
LL.D., Professor of Classical Philology in Harvard 
University. Prepared for publication by Albert 
Andrew Howard, Ph.D., Pope Professor of Latin ; 
and the plans and drawings prepared by Herbert 
Langford Warren, A.M., Nelson Robinson, Jr., 
Professor of Architecture in Harvard University. 

The translation of the De Architectura is a work to which 
the late Professor Morgan devoted the last years of his 
life. Probably no other treatise has influenced the history 
of architecture so much as this, which is our chief source- 
book for the principles of Roman building. The numerous 
illustrations exemplify in full the methods as well as the 
results in Roman architecture.

Library Books Come and 
Library Books Go, but 

Binding Goes on Forever! 

A good way to discover the best binding is to send 
a selection of books, varying widely in qualities of 
paper, to different binders, sending some to 

CHIVERS' BINDERY, Brooklyn, N.Y. 

Then watch their service and discover whose 
bindings allow of the most issues in good condition. 

CHIVERS' BINDINGS have, with more or less 
success, been imitated in several particulars, but by 
no means in all. 

You can have the REAL THING just as low in price 
as the partial imitation, with lasting economies in 
money and service.

OLD HALLOWELL ON THE KENNEBEC 

By EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON 

Author of Old Colonial Homes in Maine, and other works 
Is a new book on the early Colonial and later local history of 
the Kennebec, a book to quote from the Boston Evening 
Transcript "true as history, compelling as romance, ... of 
great interest and value as a contribution to the history of New 
England. From the records of the Plymouth settlers, who estab- 
lished a trading post on the Kennebec in 1627, from the Relations 
of the Jesuits, who had a mission there among the Abenakis, 
from old-time letters and unpublished manuscripts, from early 
newspapers and for the later decades from her own girlhood 
memories, Mrs. Nason has produced in this volume a picture of 
the social and intellectual life of Old Hallo well, notable not only 
for its scholarly accuracy, but also for its rare literary charm. 
The volume is illustrated with sixty-four full-page half-tones 
from photographs of rare portraits, of fine old houses, and of 
the picturesque scenery of Hallowell. It is an octavo of 359 
pages, with broad margins, gilt top, and rich cloth binding. Ita 
price is $3.50 ; postage, 24 cents extra.
