THE LITERARY YEAR IN 
RETROSPECT. 

Literature has suffered some severe losses 
| during the year just ended, although the record 
is less disastrous than that for 1892. The 
most serious loss came early in the year with 
the death of Taine. Occurring, as it did, only 
a few months after the death of Renan, the 
sympathies of the world were naturally directed 
towards the country that had, within so brief a 
space, been bereft of its two greatest men. The 
death, in midsummer, of Maupassant, again 
made France the poorer, although that brilliant 
writer was held in more of admiration than of 
affection, and although the circumstances un- 
der which a continuance of existence seemed 
possible for him were of such a nature as to 
make the tidings of his decease a relief rather 
than a sorrow. Turning from France to En- 
gland, we are met by the names of Symonds, 
Jowett, and Tyndall, each a master in his 
chosen field of scholarship, and each sincerely 
mourned by the host of those whom he had in- 
spired and helped. To the letters of our own 
country the death of Parkman has been the 
loss that overshadows all others, although the 
names of Brooks and Booth and Lucy Larcom 
must not go unmentioned. We should also 
signalize the loss suffered by the art of music 
in the deaths of Gounod and Tschaikowsky, 
indisputably the greatest, respectively, among 
French and Russian composers of the present 
day. 

We now turn to the very difficult task of 
selecting, from the thousands of volumes pub- 
lished during 1893, the few tljat seem of the 
most importance and enduring value. From 
this enumeration we shall doubtless omit many 
works that some of our readers would think 
deserving of mention ; but we can at least give 
the assurance that our list includes only publi- 
cations of substantial importance in their re- 
spective departments. 

Beginning with poetry, we find little that 
deserves mention. Our chronicle for 1892 in- 
cluded the names of Tennyson, Whittier, Mr. 
Swinburne, and Mr. William Morris ; our list 
for 1893 includes no names more important 



THE DIAJL 



[Jan. 1, 



than those of Mr. R. W. Gilder, Mr. Charles 
Leonard Moore, Mr. William Watson, Mr. 
Norman Gale, Mr. Bliss Carman, Professor C. 
G. D. Roberts, Miss Thomas, Miss Guiney, 
and Madame Darmesteter. Each of these 
writers has published a creditable volume ; but 
all are minor poets, and the contrast between 
1893 and 1892 is marked. The novelists have 
been as busy as ever during the past year, but 
nothing very startling is to be found among 
their productions. Among our own writers of 
fiction, Mr. Howells has published " The World 
of Chance" and "The Coast of Bohemia" 
a poor novel and a good one. Mr. Crawford 
has also given us two stories, one of which, 
"Pietro Ghisleri," is among the better of his 
books. Mr. Henry Fuller's " The Cliff Dwell- 
ers," Mr. Frederic's " The Copperhead," Mrs. 
Catherwood's "The White Islander," and Mr. 
Harte's volume of stories, " Sally Dows," are 
among the more notable books of fiction. 
Among English novels, " The Heavenly Twins " 
and "Dodo" perhaps head the list in point of 
popularity ; while Mr. Stevenson's " David 
Balfour," Mr. Doyle's "The Refugees," Mr. 
Weyman's " A Gentleman of France," and 
Mr. Kipling's "Many Inventions" are close 
followers, and ef more real importance. The 
translator of fiction has given us M. Bourget's 
" Cosmopolis," and two works by Sienkiewicz 
"Without Dogma " and " Pan Michael "- 
so different in manner that we find it difficult 
to attribute them to the same pen, but both 
highly noteworthy. 

The department of biography and letters (in 
the literal sense) is the richest in the chron- 
icles of the year. What may, indeed, be called 
the two books of the year come within this cat- 
egory. The appearance of the letters of Scott 
and of Lowell are events of capital importance. 
The letters of Asay Gray are of more limited 
interest, but their publication is also an event. 
Among biographies we find the important lives 
of Mr. Ruskin^ Wagner, Pusey, Lincoln, and 
Alcott, the completion of the Sumner upon 
which Mr. Pierce has been for so many years 
engaged, and Mr. Bridge's recollections of Haw- 
thorne. In autobiography, we have Mr. Le- 
land's extremely entertaining memoirs ; " The 
Story of My Life," by Dr. Ebers ; " Further 
Recollections of a Happy Life," by Miss 
North ; and the first volume of the Pasquier 
memoirs. In literary history and criticism the 
foremost books relate to Greek literature, be- 
ing Mr. Pater's " Plato and Platonism," Mr. 
Lang's " Homer and the Epic," and Professor 



Jebb's " The Growth and Influence of Clas- 
sical Greek Poetry." The new edition of Sy- 
monds's " Greek Poets " must also be men- 
tioned here. In English literary history, the 
most important of the books published is the 
sketch of " Early English Literature," by the 
Rev. Stopford Brooke. 

History, political science and economics dis- 
play great activity at the present time in all 
the more civilized countries, and have received 
many important contributions during the year. 
Among* these we may mention Captain Ma- 
han's " Influence of Sea Power upon the 
French Revolution and Empire," a work that 
has met with extraordinary favor in this coun- 
try and abroad ; " Fifty Years of Australian 
History," by Sir Henry Parkes ; " The Cam- 
paign of Waterloo," by Mr. John C. Ropes ; 
" The Dawn of Italian Independence," by Mr. 
W. R. Thayer: "The Empire of the Tsars 
and the Russians," by M. Leroy-Beaulieu ; 
" The United States," by Professor Goldwin 
Smith ; " Comparative Administrative Law," 
by Professor Goodnow ; " The Church in the 
Roman Empire," by Mr. W. M. Ramsay ; the 
new volume of " English Economic History 
and Theory," by Professor Ashley ; the new 
edition of Professor Bryce's " American Com- 
monwealth "; and many other works that we 
have not space to mention. 

A few other publications of exceptional im- 
portance, not comprised within the above cat- 
egories, are the following : " Drawing and En- 
graving," by Mr. P. G. Hamerton ; " The Art 
of Music," by Dr. Parry; " Pablo de Segovia," 
with the Vierge illustrations ; " The Mummy," 
by Dr. E. A. W. Budge; the completion of 
Mr. Spencer's " Principles of Ethics "; a vol- 
ume of philosophical essays, by Mr. Leslie 
Stephen ; Mr. H. F. Brown's " Venice "; " The 
Ruined Cities of Mashonaland," by Mr. The- 
odore Bent ; a treatise on evolutionary ethics, 
by Miss C. M. Williams ; Professor Weiss- 
man's work on " The Germ-Plasm "; Dr. Nan- 
sen's " Eskimo Life "; M. E. Michel's " Rem- 
brandt"; "Socialism and the American Spirit," 
by Mr. N. P. Gilman ; and a posthumous vol- 
ume of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson. A 
few important new editions are the Lewis and 
Clark of Dr. Coues, the Coleridge of Mr. J.

THE TAX ON KNOWLEDGE. 

We have received a number of communications 
from persons interested in the removal of the ob- 
noxious duty upon English books which has so long 
disgraced our tariff legislation, and, for some mys- 
terious reason, has been embodied in the Wilson 
Bill, greatly to its disfigurement. We believe that 
the friends of education have it in their power to 
bring to bear upon the members of our National 
Legislature a degree of pressure sufficient to result 
in the removal of a duty which protects nobody, 
which brings little revenue to the government, and 
which is chiefly fruitful in petty annoyances to the 
scholar. But whatever is done must be done with- 
out delay. The Wilson Bill will come up for dis- 
cussion at once, and is likely to be rushed through 
the House in three or four weeks. As a help to 
concerted action we suggest the form of petition 
given below, to be sent, with as many signatures as 
possible, through as many Members of Congress as 
possible, at as early a date as possible. 

A PETITION FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE DUTY ON BOOKS 
PRINTED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America, in Congress assembled: 

We, the undersigned, believing that an import duty 
on books printed in tbe English language, as provided 
both by the existing and the proposed Tariff Laws, is 
wrong in principle, being a tax upon knowledge and a 
hindrance to the growth of intelligence among the 
people, while it is at the same time insignificant as a 
source of revenue; and believing that the continuance 
of such a duty is unworthy of a free and enlightened 
people, 

Do respectfully petition your honorable body to place 
all books and other publications printed in the English 
language upon the list of those articles which may be 
imported into the United States without the payment 
of duty. 

And your petitioners will ever pray. 

We have prepared this petition in a form ready 
for receiving signatures, and will mail copies of it 
free of charge to all persons who may apply for 
them. 



A STUDY IN LITERARY AMENITY. 

The December issue of " The Nineteenth Cen- 
tury " contains a reminiscent article by Mr. Swin- 
burne upon the late Master of Balliol. The author 
knew Jowett intimately, and his personal recollec- 
tions are of the highest interest. But the article is 
disfigured by a number of those " flings " which Mr. 
Swinburne so frequently interjects into his prose 



papers, and which are usually characterized by both 
irrelevancy and bad taste. Some readers will re- 
member his characterization of Emerson, a few 
years ago, as "a foul-mouthed Yankee philosoph- 
aster," as well as some other things equally deplor- 
able. In this particular case, Lowell, Mark Patti- 
son, and J. A. Symonds are the objects of his vitu- 
perative assault. Hence, and in spite of our ad- 
miration for the genius of Mr. Swinburne when he is 
his better self, we have witnessed with no little satis- 
faction the castigation dealt him by " The Saturday 
Review " upon the present occasion. It is no less de- 
served than severe, and we have much pleasure in 
reproducing the article, which bears " Nineteenth 
Century Manners " for a title. 

" It is high time that the Editor of the ' Nineteenth 
Century ' should be made to understand that there is a 
limit to the offences against good manners in which the 
writers in his magazine can be permitted to indulge. 
During the past twelvemonth certain things have been 
included in the ' Nineteenth Century ' which are dis- 
tasteful, and even painful, to many readers. In the 
November number we thought that the climax had 
come. We did not suppose that anything could exceed 
the nauseating tittle-tattle about Miss Clairmont in- 
dulged in by an American interviewer. We were mis- 
taken; an article in the December number, in which 
Mr. Swinburne disports himself among his deceased 
contemporaries, under the pretence of writing ' recol- 
lections of Professor Jowett,' goes further still. We 
say, and with all gravity, that in the very least respon- 
sible journalism of this generation we have never met 
with anything quite so ill-bred as one or two paragraphs 
in Mr. Swinburne's article. They do small credit to 
the Editor of the review. ' But that's not much.' Mr. 
Swinburne is a very different person, and we propose 
to ourselves, at last, to speak the truth very plainly to 
that illustrious poet. When he writes so casually of 
Mr. Lowell's ' hideous and Boeotian jests,' when he de- 
scribes the amiability of a respected and valued man of 
letters as ' instinctive time-serving and obsequious sub- 
missiveness,' when he talks of Euripides as < the clum- 
siest of botchers that ever floundered through his work 
as a dramatist,' he discredits himself by his foolish vio- 
lence indeed ; but when he goes on to call the late Rector 
of Lincoln ' a typical and unmistakable ape of the Dead 
Sea,' and when he insults the memory of the late Mr. 
Symonds with a string of vile epithets, he simply writes 
as no gentleman should write. 

It is time that Mr. Swinburne should grow up. He 
has played for nearly half a century the role of the dear 
little naughty darling who must not be punished because 
he is so clever and so young. Years and years ago, 
when Mr. Swinburne first began to write, this plea was 
brought forward and accepted. < Isn't he clever ? ' peo- 
ple said ; ' and so young.' There was something in the 
excuse. He was daring and brilliant, and much was to 
be forgiven him. He said very rude things about Mr. 
Buchanan and Mr. Furnivall, and looked at some mi- 
nute contemporaries under the microscope. Nobody 
cared: they were fair game; and so the habit of being 
rude grew on Mr. Swinburne. It was an evil day when 
he was allowed a naughty little boy of thirty odd 
summers to call Mr. Emerson a hoary and now tooth- 
less ape.' (To differ from Mr. Swinburne turns any 
one by that mere act into an ape.) He should have 
been well snubbed on that occasion, but then he was so 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



young, and so clever. And he has gone on from bad 
to worse, increasing the shrill falsetto of his abuse, pour- 
ing it upon more and more distinguished reputations, 
until now we are waking up to perceive that Mr. Swin- 
burne has not yet got over faults in manner which only 
extreme youth can excuse. 

" What makes it peculiarly painful to us to have to 
say this is that we admire the genius of Mr. Swinburne, 
and that we are not often out of sympathy with the 
aversions that he expresses. But who can admire the 
violence of his diction, the absence of anything like mod- 
eration in his utterances ? We hold no brief here for 
Mr. Mark Pattison, who, perhaps, had shortcomings; 
but if anything would make us his fervent apologists, it 
would be Mr. Swinburne yelling and snarling at him as 
an 'ape of the Dead Sea.' We were no admirers of 
the too morbid tendency of certain of the writings of 
Mr. Symouds, but we said so while he was alive, and 
we did not wait, as Mr. Swinburne has done, until he is 
dead, and it is quite safe to insult him. But Mr. Swin- 
burne is such a preux chevalier. 

" One last word to Mr. Swinburne. No man of let- 
ters of our generation has been treated so tenderly, 
indulged so much, or forgiven so often as he has been. 
His genius is unquestionable, and on the score of it he 
has been pardoned faults for which any other writer 
would be ostracised. But the public patience may be- 
come exhausted. And literature has a long memory." 

The " long memory " here ascribed to literature may 
possibly be sharpened, for the writer in " The Sat- 
urday Review," by recollection of a little passage 
at arms between that journal and Mr. Swinburne 
just ten years ago. When the Poet Laureate of 
England was made a peer, some Saturday reviewer, 
to a certain extent justifiably exasperated by the 
senseless cackle of those who made haste to express 
the opinion that the acceptance of the honor was 
unworthy of Tennyson, penned the following mem- 
orable words : " As a matter of fact, no man liv- 
ing, or who ever lived not Caesar or Pericles, not 
Shakespeare or Michael Angelo, could confer honor 
more than he took on entering the House of Lords." 
Mr. Swinburne promptly took up the gauntlet thus 
thrown, and, characterizing the remark as "clumsy 
and shallow snobbery," dashed off " The Conserv- 
ative Journalist's Anthem," a sonnet neither com- 
plimentary to the House of Lords nor to its over- 
zealous journalistic champion. The " long memory " 
of " The Saturday Review " is clearly illustrated 
by the article we have reprinted. As for the son- 
net, our readers may be interested in having their 
attention recalled to it. 

" Lords our Gods, beneficent, sublime, 

In the evening, and before the morning flames, 
We praise, we bless, we magnify your names. 

The slave is he that serves not ; his the crime 

And shame, who hails not as the crown of Time 
That House wherein the all-envious world acclaims 
Such glory that the reflex of it shames 

All crowns bestowed of men for prose or rhyme. 

The serf, the cur, the sycophant is he 

Who feels no cringing motion twitch his knee 
When from a height too high for Shakespeare nods 

The wearer of a higher than Milton's crown. 

Stoop, Chaucer, stoop : Keats, Shelley, Burns, bow down : 
These have no parts with you, Lords our Gods." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



TYNDALL AND SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your article on John Tyndall, in the current num- 
ber of THE DIAL, you leave the impression upon the 
mind of the reader that this great and wise teacher 
held and taught the doctrine of the spontaneous gener- 
ation of life. I would be glad to have you indicate 
from Professor Tyndall's works the basis on which such 
a representation of his position upon this important mat- 
ter rests. When and where did he announce any change 
of opinion from that given in " The Nineteenth Century," 
page 507, 1878, where he says that, while he wishes the 
evidence were the other way, he is constrained to " affirm 
that no shred of trustworthy experimental testimony 
exists to prove that life in our day has ever appeared 
independent of antecedent life " ? 

My mind is entirely hospitable to all the new science, 
truly so-called; and this is largely because I find no 
necessary conflict between it and a rationally scriptural 
theistic conception of the world. If Harvey's maxim, 
" Omne vivum ex ovo" as amended by Charles Robin, 
" Omne vivum ex vivo" is a discredited doctrine, such 
a position is of difficult if not impossible entertain- 
ment. But my reading has led me to believe that, as 
Professor Huxley declares in his " Critiques and Ad- 
dresses," this doctrine remains " victorious along the 
whole line at the present day." After building up any 
system of religious and scientific truth into comfortable 
harmony, based upon the conclusions I have judged to 
be reached by such teachers as Tyndall, Huxley, Wal- 
lace, Le Conte, Sir William Thomson, Laycock, Tait, and 
a host of others, it comes to me as something of a shock 
to have THE DIAL suggest so radical a change of opin- 
ion on the part of a leading authority as that above re- 
ferred to. No doubt there are many others who would 
like the information for which I ask. 

DWIGHT P. BREED. 

Wyandotte, Mick., Dec. 23, 1893. 

[That spontaneous generation has occurred, some- 
how, somewhere, in the history of the world, is a 
conclusion irresistibly forced upon the thorough- 
going evolutionist. If Tyndall's frequently quoted 
words about " the promise and the potency " mean 
anything at all, they mean that. But spontaneous 
generation as a necessary link in the evolutionary 
chain is one thing, and spontaneous generation as 
an experimental demonstration is quite another. 
Professor Tyndall's polemic on the subject was di- 
rected mainly against the alleged results of one 
man's experiments, and proved merely that spon- 
taneous generation could not have occurred in Dr. 
Bastian's laboratory under the conditions specified. 
If our correspondent will turn to page 269 in the 
volume of " The Nineteenth Century " already re- 
ferred to, he will find a fair statement of the way in 
which spontaneous generation, as a logical postulate, 
is regarded by the leading biologists of the century. 
One can only escape their conclusion by recourse 
to some such hypothesis as that of Lord Kelvin, 
who suggested that a meteoric body might have 
brought the first protoplasm to this planet. But 
this is an obvious evasion of the difficulty, and few,

THE DIAL 



if any, will take seriously so improbable and inad- 
equate an explanation. We must say in conclusion, 
that a religious faith whose " comfortable harmony " 
is capable of being upset by any possible result of 
biological investigation seems to us in a bad way.

A QUOTATION CORRECTED. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the number of THE DIAL for December 16, a com- 
munication from " Jonathan," commenting on British 
asininity as exemplified by the "Saturday Review," 
quoted from Byron the following: 

'* The world is a big load of hay ; 

Mankind are the asses that pull ; 
Each tugs in a different way 

But the greatest of all is John Bull." 
The epigram as Byron wrote it reads thus: 
" The world is a bundle of hay, 

Mankind are the asses who pull ; 
Each tugs it a different way, 

And the greatest of all is John Bull." 

The differences are few and small, perhaps, but when 
exact quotation is professed it ought to be performed. 
I notice misquotation of Byron so often that I am led 
to believe that he is now very little read. jyj jj

THE TARIFF ON BOOKS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Attracted by your timely comment on the tariff on 
books in the proposed revision of the tariff law, I have 
begun circulating the following petition here: 

" To [name of Representative in Congress]. We, the 
undersigned, believing that a tax on knowledge is con- 
sistent with neither the idea of a protective tariff nor 
with that of true liberty, earnestly urge you to exert 
your influence toward abolishing the duty on imported 
books and other publications not covered by copyright." 

I have also written letters to a dozen friends in other 
colleges, urging them to begin a similar movement in 
their Congressional districts. By prompt and concerted 
action among the friends of free knowledge, the con- 
tinuance of this deplorable tax may be averted.

A TRIBUTE TO TWO DEAD AUTHORS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Literary workers who are not of the highest grade 
may well despair of posthumous fame, if they have ob- 
served the neglect of the chief literary periodicals of 
our country to chronicle the passing away, a few months 
ago, of two authors who, though not in the front rank 
of writers, yet left behind them contributions to our lit- 
erature of permanent value. The intelligence of their 
death reached me in November, through a magazine 
devoted to autograph collecting, both of these gentle- 
men having been successful collectors of historical doc- 
uments. 

Thomas Stephens Collier was born in New York City 
in 1842. He followed the sea from early boyhood, 
served in the navy during the Civil War, was placed 
on the retired list of navy officers in 1883, and took up 
his residence in New London, Conn., where he died 
suddenly, in October, I think. He was a prominent 



member of the New London Historical Society. He 
contributed poems to the popular magazines, and wrote 
historical sketches on naval subjects. To a volume of 
collected poems (1890) he gave the title " Song Spray." 
A poem of his appears in the tenth volume of the 
" Library of American Literature." 

Charles Colcock Jones, Jr., was a Georgian, born in 
1831. He was admitted to the bar of his native state, 
but enlisted in the Confederate Army at the breaking 
out of the war, and rose to the rank of colonel. After 
the war he returned to his profession, which he prac- 
ticed in New York. He wrote much on historical sub- 
jects, and was the recognized authority in the history of 
Georgia. A H N

A CLASSICAL "SOLECISM." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In parting, as employed in " the parting guest," there 
is a survival of a sense that formerly was one of the 
commonest meanings of part when used intransitively, 
viz., depart, set out, go away. This archaic sense of part 
is seen in the lines below: 

" Before man parted for this earthly strand, 
While yet upon the verge of heaven he stood." 

(Matthew Arnold, Poems, "Revolutions.") 
The employment of part in this way was extremely fre- 
quent in the seventeenth and the latter part of the six- 
teenth century. 

"... she told him the truth, with all circumstances; 
how being parted alone [how having set out alone], meaning to 
die in some solitary place. . . ." (Sir Philip Sidney, " Ar- 
cadia," Collected Writings, ed. 1598, p. 28). 

Part from, or merely part, was used with hence and 
similar adverbs. 

" My lord, 'tis time for us to part from hence." 

(Thomas Dekker, " The Shoemaker's Holiday," Act V. sc. i.) 

" No, I am fixt not to part hence without him." 

(Milton, "Sampson Agonistes," 1. 1481.) 

I have said that depart is an archaic meaning of part. 
Yet there is considerable evidence that this sense, in 
certain connections, at least, is in common use. For 
instance, in Webster's International Dictionary, the sec- 
ond definition of part v. i. is " to go away, to depart, to 
take leave," etc.; and one of the illustrative quotations 
cited is this: "He owned he had parted from the duke 
only a few hours before." (Macaulay.) Similar defi- 
nitions, without characterization or comment, are found 
in other dictionaries. But, if this sense of part is not 
really archaic, how does it happen that the historic dif- 
ference between part from and part with is so often over- 
looked by scholarly people when they are moved to cau- 
tion the unlearned against a supposed misuse of part 
with f Here is an example : 

" So, though we still say ' I parted with a house,' or ' with 
a servant ' (considered as a chattel, [!], we could not say ' When 
you parted with the King.' " Rich. II., 2, 2. (E. A. Abbott, 
" A Shakespearian Grammar," London, 1886, Sect. 194, pp. 
128-9.) 

The index, referring to this passage, says " ' parted with ' 
for ' parted from,' 194." Now, as the play shows us, it 
was not " you," the queen, that parted from the king, 
but the king that parted from the queen for Ireland. 
In saying " when you parted with the King," Shake- 
speare observed a distinction that was usually observed 
at that time between part from and part with, but which 
at the present day is generally disregarded. If the 
older meaning of part from had not sunk into the ob- 



8 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



scurity of an archaism, there would be fewer instances 
of those misconceived corrections of part with that turn 
up now so often. 

To part with once had three meanings: 

(1) To depart with. 

"... and taking onely with him certaine principall 
Jewels of his owne, hee [Daiphantus] would have parted [de- 
parted] alone with Argalus . . . but that the whole multi- 
tude wold needes gard him [Daiphantus] into Arcadia." 
(Sir Philip Sidney, "Arcadia," Collected Writings, ed. 1598, 
p. 26.) 

(2) To relinquish. 

" Soldiers forget their honours, usurers 
Make sacrifice of gold, poets of wit, 
And men religious part with fame and goodness." 
(Massinger, " The Fatal Dowry," Act I, sc. i.) 

(3) To be separated from, especially after the ex- 
pression of farewell wishes, etc.; to dismiss or let go 
with courteous expressions of regard. 

" Come, He convey thee through the City-gate, 
And ere I part with thee, confer at large 
Of all that may concerne thy Love-affairs." 
(" The Two Gentlemen of Verona," Act III., sc. i.) 

We have to do here with the third meaning of part 
with, and to observe that it differed from the common 
meaning of part from. The widest divergence in the 
employment of the two phrases would be seen where 
somebody parted with a friend making or about to make 
a journey, and where an offended or unfriendly person 
parted from another unceremoniously. 

" Nay, with your favour let him stay a little ; 
I would part with him too, because he is 
Your companion ; and I '11 begin with him." 
(Thomas Dekker, " The Witch of Edmonton," Act III., sc. ii.) 
'' He parted frowning from me, as if ruin 
Leap'd from his eyes." 

(" Henry VIII.," Act III., sc. ii.) 

In the former of these two quotations evidently the 
prominent idea belonging to part with is the observance 
of the friendly courtesies that usually are exchanged 
when friends or acquaintances separate. But it is likely 
that when there was no occasion for accentuating the dif- 
ferences in sense between part with and part from that 
the two phrases were sometimes used interchangeably. 
It is not clear, for instance, that either would be distinctly 
more appropriate than the other in the next quotation. 

" Before I part with this Mayden City, I will make a par- 
allel betwixt her and old Rome . . ." (James Howell, " A 
Survay of the Signorie of Venice," ed. 1651, p. 44.) 
Here the courteous dismissal or surrender of the " May- 
den City " may be the idea uppermost in the mind of 
the writer. 

Whether the distinction between part from and part 
with, pointed out above, has lasted to the present day, 
I am uncertain; for, notwithstanding that the distinc- 
tion is disregarded by the many, it may, perhaps, be 
observed by the few. But, anyhow, a misconception of 
the real difference between the two phrases has grown 
up, so that people who are ambitious to speak and write 
the best schoolmaster's English substitute part from for 
part with in cases where, if the two phrases do not mean 
the same thing, part with is, in fact, more appropriate. 
It is to be regretted that this pedagogic affectation is 
countenanced by Dr. Fitzedward Hall's high authority. 

In "Recent Exemplifications of False Philology" 
(pp. 103-6), Dr. Hall, citing examples of " solecisms " 
found in the writings of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Dr. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, italicises with in the following 
passage quoted (p. 106) from The Autocrat of the 



Breakfast-table": "I remember a young wife who had 
to part with her husband for a time." In the index, we 
are told that, at page 106, part wilh is for part from. 

But part with, as there employed by Dr. Holmes, has 
been classical English for three centuries. To the ex- 
amples previously given I will add the following: 

"... To avoid seeing people that I love well enough to 
be very much mortified when I think I am going to part with 
them for ever." (Lady M. W. Montagu, Letter, Vienna, Jan. 
16,0.8.1717.) 
But observe the use of part from in the next quotation : 

' ' Poor Lady G is parting from her discreet spouse for a 

mere trifle." (Id., Letter to the Countess of Mar, Twicken- 
ham, 1723.) 

"An affectionate wife, when in fear of parting with her be- 
loved husband, heartily desired of God his life or society, 
upon any conditions that were not sinful." (Taylor Cited 
in Johnson's Dictionary, first ed., 1755, To part ivith). 

"She could not divest herself of the belief that she had 
parted with Valancourt to meet no more." (Ann Radcliffe, 
" The Mysteries of Udolpho," 2d ed., 1794, vol. i., ch. xiv., 
p. 402.) 

"She came solitarily down the gravel walk a Miss Martin 
just appearing at the door, and parting with her seemingly 
with ceremonious civility." (Jane Austen, "Emma," first 
ed., vol. ii., ch. v., p. 72.) 

"I had, apparently, most reason for dejection, because I 
was leaving the savior of my life. . . . She, on the contrary, 
who was parting with one who had little means of serving her, 
except by kindness and brotherly treatment, was overcome by 
sorrow." (Thomas De Quincey, " Confessions of an English 
Opium-Eater," Boston, 1856, p. 48.) 

"I went to various coasts of the Mediterranean; parted 
with my friends at Rome. . . ." (Cardinal Newman, " Apol- 
ogia pro Vita Sua," London, 1883, ch. i., p. 32.) 

" For here I came, twenty years back, the week 
Before I parted with poor Edmund." 

(Tennyson, " The Brook.") 

"... unknown to any one lest the troops should lose 
courage at parting with him, he [Caesar] flew across through 
an enemy's country with a handful of attendants to Vienne, 
on the Rhone. . . ." (James Anthony Froude, "Caesar," 
New York, 1879, p. 345.) 

"... when the pangs of parting with the old lady were 
no longer felt in all their intensity." (Philip Gilbert Ham- 
erton, " Harry Blount," ch. ii.) 

" Our Boston informant writes so crisply and smartly that 
one is unwilling to part with him." (Matthew Arnold, " A 
Word about America," Boston, 1888, p. 78.) 

The distinction between part from &nd-part with that 
has been denned and illustrated above seems to have 
been observed more or less I am not prepared to say 
always by Macaulay, De Quincey, and Matthew Ar- 
nold. By De Quincey and Macaulay, however, the sug- 
gestion of good-will and regret associated with part with 
was disregarded. 

"... if I had parted with him at that moment, I should 
have thought of him ... as a surly and almost brutal fel- 
low." (De Quincey, "Confessions of an English Opium- 
Eater, "Boston, 1856, p. 50.) 

" Influenced by such considerations as these, James, from 
the time at which he parted in anger with his Parliament, be- 
gan to meditate a general league of all Nonconformists. . . ." 
(Macaulay, "History of England," ch. vii.) 

James had in person prorogued Parliament. 
" The authority of very excellent writers," says Dr. 
Hall in his Doctor Indoctus (p. 45) "justifies 'than 
whom '; and there is an end." Is not the authority for 
Dr. Holmes's "solecism" as good? Sometimes Dr. 
Hall's judgments seem arbitrary. R. p. WILLIAMS.

HANS 



GROSSTHATEN.* 



In turning over the leaves of Mr. Leland's 
vivacious, if rather chaotic, Memoirs, one is im- 
pelled to exclaim with Mr. Wackford Squeers, 
" Here's richness ! " Mr. Leland really seems 
to have been a little of everything, seen a little 
of everything, done a little of everything, and 
read a little of everything ; yet in spite of his 
multifarious experiences he sees fit to make 
the following modest disclaimer in his preface : 

" As some of my readers will find these volumes 
wanting in personal adventure and lively variety of ex- 
periences, and perhaps dull as regards ' incidents,' I 
would remind them that it is, after all, only the life of 
a mere literary man and quiet, humble scholar, and that 
such existences are seldom very dramatic." 

Were the writer any other than Mr. Leland 
whom all men know as the pink of modesty 
and candor, one might reply, quoting Soc- 
rates, " I see your vanity, Antisthenes, peep- 
ing through the holes in your cloak." What 
may be Mr. Leland's notion of a really active 
and stirring life, we know not ; but his readers 
will scarcely accept as a literary recluse and 
*' quiet, humble scholar " one who has been 
by turns a roistering BurscJi at Heidelberg 
and Munich, a chimes-at-midnight reveller of 
the Latin Quarter, a barricade hero in a Paris 
revolution, a bon ami of Lola Montez and a 
pupil of A. Bronson Alcott, a managing editor 
under P. T. Barnum and John W. Forney, 
a man, in short, whose career seems to have 
been (at least so far as it is treated in the pres- 
ent volume) about as serene and scholastic as 
the finale of a certain famous " barty." Mr. 
Leland's life has had, of course, its sporadic 
intervals of comparative quiet ; but we note 
the above phases lest the prospective reader of 
the Memoirs be turned from his purpose by the 
author's hint of the very last quality to be predi- 
cated of it dryness. 

Mr. Leland says that his book was written, 
not directly for publication, but with the idea 
that " a certain friend " might use it at the 
proper time as a source whence to form a life. 
"Therefore," he adds, "I wrote, as fully and 
honestly as I could, everything which I could 
remember which had made me what I am." 
The volume treats in detail of the author's in- 
fancy in Philadelphia (where he was born in 
1824), with some note of the quaint old Qua-

ker City as it then was, and of many of its in- 
habitants who still remembered Colonial times 
and Washington's Republican Court ; of his 
boyhood, school-days, and early reading ; of his 
college life at Princeton, Heidelberg, Munich, 
and Paris ; of the stirring events of the French 
Revolution of '48, quorum pars magna fuit ; 
of his subsequent life in America as lawyer, 
author, journalist, soldier, etc. ; of his three 
years' connection with Colonel Forney, " dur- 
ing which," he says, " Grant's election was cer- 
tainly carried by him, and in which, as Forney 
declared, I ' had been his right-hand man ' "; 
of his writing of sundry books, such as the 
" Breitmann Ballads "; and of his subsequent 
life in Europe down to the year 1870. It will 
be seen even from this meagre synopsis that 
the author's idea of the career of a " quiet, 
humble scholar " differs somewhat from the 
conventional one. Without attempting to fol- 
low Mr. Leland's sprightly recital in detail or 
in the order of narration, we shall select there- 
from a few random extracts that may serve in 
a general way to indicate its quality. After a 
laborious course of jurisprudence, tobacco, met- 
aphysics, Rheinwein, Natur-philosophie, lager, 
"und leider auch Theologie," at Heidelberg 
and Munich, our quiet scholar reached Paris 
(1847), and here his exploits, as a student of 
the Latin Quarter, seem to have been largely of 
the sort boasted of by Robert Shallow, Esquire. 
To cite a very mild instance : 

" It happened one night at Bobinot's that I sat in the 
front row of the stage-box, and by me a very pretty, 
modest, and respectable young girl, with her elder re- 
lations or friends. How it happened I do not know, 
but they all went out, leaving the young lady by me, 
and I did not speak to her. Which ' point ' was at once 
seized by the house. The pit, as if moved by one dia- 
bolical inspiration, began to roar, 'II Vem brassera ! ' 
(He will kiss her), to which the gallery replied, 'II ne 
I'embrassera pas I ' (He won't). So they kept it up and 
down alternately like see-sawing, to an intonation. . . . 
I saw that something must be done ; so, rising, I waved 
my glove, and there was dead silence. Then I began 
at the top of my voice, in impassioned style, in German, 
an address about matters and things in general, inter- 
mingled with insane quotations from Latin, Slavonian, 
anything. A change came o'er the spirit of the dream 
of my auditors, till at last they 'took,' and gave me 
three cheers. I had sold the house." 

Soon after reaching Paris Mr. Leland took 
lodgings in a house in the Rue de la Harpe 
called the Hotel de Luxembourg, a nest, as it 
proved, of rather doubtful and desperate char- 
acters. In the same establishment dwelt a 
small actress or two, and divers students, or men 
who were extremely busy all winter in plotting 
the revolution which presently broke out :

[Jan. 1, 



" At last the ball opened. . . . The great storm- 
bell of Notre Dame rang all night long. The next morn- 
ing I rose, and telling Leonard Field, who lived in the 
same hotel with me, that I was going to work in earnest, 
loaded a pair of duelling-pistols, tied a sash round my 
waist, en revolutionnaire, and with him went forth to 
business. First I went to the Cafe* Rotonde, hard by, 
and got my breakfast. Then I sallied forth, and found 
in the Rue de la Harpe a gang of fifty insurgents, who 
had arms and a crowbar, but who wanted a leader. 
Seeing that I was one of them, one said to me, ' Sir, 
where shall we make a barricade ? ' I replied that there 
was one already to the right and another farther down, 
but that a third close at hand was open. Without a 
word they handed me the crowbar, and I prized up the 
stones out of the pavement while they undertook the 
harder work of piling them up. In a few minutes we 
had a solid wall eight feet ffigh. Then remembering 
that there was a defenceless spot somewhere else, 1 
marched my troop thither, and built another barricade 
all in grim earnest without talking. . . . There was 
a garc.on named Edouard, who always waited on me in 
the Cafe" Rotonde. While I was working for life afrmy 
second barricade, he came out holding a napkin, and ex- 
amining my labor critically, waved it, exclaimed approv- 
ingly, ' Tres Men, Citoyen Charles tres bien ! ' It was 
his little joke for some days after to call me Citoyen 
Charles." 

"Citoyen Charles's" republican enthusiasm was 
not, it seems, shared by all his compatriots in 
Paris. One day, he relates, there came sprawl- 
ing over the barricades 

" A tall ungainly red-haired Yankee, a student of med- 
icine, whom I had met before, and who began to ques- 
tion me as to what I was doing. To which I replied, 
' What the devil do you want here anyhow ? ' not be- 
ing in a mood to be trifled with. To which he replied, 
' Nawthin', only a kinder lookin' reound. But what on 
airth ' But are you for us or against ? ' I cried. 
' Wall, I ain't on no side.' ' See here,' I cried in a rage, 
' those who are not for us are against us. Any one of 
those fellows you see round here would shoot you at 
once if I told him to, and if you don't clear out in 
double quick time, by God I will ! ' " 

Evidently, the once humble scholar was fast 
ripening into a Marat or a St. Just, and might 
have inaugurated a new Reign of Terror had 
not the revolution speedily ended. He gives the 
following graphic picture of the denouement : 
" All at once we heard a terrible outcry down the 
street. There was a tremendous massing of soldiers 
there, and to defend that barricade meant death to all 
defenders. I confess that I hesitated one instant, and 
then rushed headlong to join the fight. Merciful God ! 
the troops had fraternized with us, and they were hand- 
ing their muskets over to the mob, who were firing them 
in the air. The scene was terribly moving. My men, 
who a minute before had expected to be shot, rushed up, 

embraced and kissed the soldiers, wept like children 

in short, everybody kissed and embraced everybody else, 
and all my warriors got guns, and therewith I dismissed 
them, for I knew that the war was now at an end/' 

We have spoken of Mr. Leland's acquaint- 
ance with Lola Montez in 1847 a tremendous 



celebrity in Munich, and the King's last fav- 
orite. Ludwig, bye-the-bye, had had all his 
mistresses painted, one by one, and in the 
spirit of a true king and liberal art-patron had 
thrown the gallery open to the public. Lola's 
portrait was the last, but the royal foresight 
had left space for a few more. " I thought," 
says the author, " that about twenty-five would 
complete the collection." Mr. Leland describes 
Lola as very small, pale, and thin, or frele, 
with fine blue eyes and curly black hair a 
typical beauty, with a face full of character, 
and a person of great and varied reading. Men 
generally were madly fascinated with her, then 
as suddenly disenchanted, " and then detracted 
from her in every way." It was in later years, 
in America, that Mr. Leland knew Lola Montez 
when he was in no danger of the royal bow- 
string, and the " space for a few more " in the 
Paphian gallery had perceptibly dwindled. 
Once, he says, 

" She proposed to me to make a bolt with her to Europe, 
which I declined. . . . An intimate of both of us who 
was present when this friendly proposal was made re- 
marked with some astonishment, ' But, Madame, by 
what means can you two live ? ' ' Oh,' replied Lola in- 
nocently and confidingly, ' people like us ' (or ' who know 
as much as we ') ' can get a living anywhere.' And she 
rolled us each a cigarette, with one for herself. I could 
tell a number of amusing tales of this Queen of Bohe- 
mia, but Space, the Kantean god, forbids me more." 

From Mr. Leland's lively account of his 
" soldiering " during the Civil War we shall 
allow ourselves two extracts. It was shortly 
before Gettysburg, when the North had risen 
en masse at the news of Lee's advance. Mr. 
Leland was put on guard, when, he says, 

" There came shambling to me an odd figure. There 
had been some slight attempt by him to look like a sol- 
dier he had a feather in his hat but he carried his 
rifle as if after deer or raccoons, and as if he were used 
to it. ' Say, Cap ! ' he exclaimed, ' Kin you tell me 
where a chap could git some ammynition ? ' ' Go to 
your quartermaster,' I replied. < Ain't got no quar- 
termaster.' ' Well, then to your commanding officer 
to your regiment.' 'Ain't got no commanding offi- 
cer nowher' this side o' God, ner no regiment.' ' Then 
who the devil are you, and where do you belong ? ' 
< Don't belong nowher'. I '1 jest tell you, Cap, how it 
is. I live in the south line of New York State, and 
when I heard that the rebs had got inter Pennsylvany, 
forty of us held a meetin' and 'pinted me Cap'n. So 
we came down here 'cross country, and 'rived this a'fer- 
noon, and find in' fightin' goin' on, went straight fer the 
bush. And gittin' cover, we shot the darndest lot of 
rebels you ever did see. And now all our ammynition 
is out, I 've come to town for more, for there 's some of 
'em left who want killiu' badly.' 'See here, my 
friend,' I replied, ' you don't know it, but you 're noth- 
ing but a bushwhacker, and anybody has a right to 
shoot you out of hand. Do you see that great square

tent ? ' Here I pointed to the general's marquee. ' Go 
in there and get yourself enrolled.' And the last I saw 
of him he was stumbling over the sticks in the right 
direction." 

For our second extract, we select this : 

" For bringing out the art of taking care of yourself, 
a camp in time of war is superior even to ' sleeping 
about in the markets,' as recommended by Mr. Weller. 
Other talents may be limited, but the amount of ' devil ' 
which can be developed out of a ' smart ' boy as a sol- 
dier is absolutely infinite. College is a Sunday-school 
to it. One of these youths had ' obtained ' a horse 
somewhere which he contrived to carry along. Many 
of our infantry regiments gradually converted them- 
selves into cavalry by this process of ' obtaining ' steeds; 
and as the officers found that their men could walk bet- 
ter on horses' legs they permitted it. This promising 
youngster was one day seated on a caisson or ammuni- 
tion wagon full of shells, etc., when it blew up. By 
a miracle he rose in the air, fell on the ground unhurt, 
and marching immediately up to the lieutenant and 
touching his hat, exclaimed, ' Please sir, caisson No. 
Two is blown to hell ; please appoint me to another ! ' 
That oath was not recorded. Poor boy ! he died in 
the war." 

In 1869 Mr. Leland revisited Europe, sailing 
from New York on the famed Pereire. " We 
had not left port," he says, " before a droll in- 
cident occurred." 

" On the table in the smoking-room lay a copy of the 
' Ballads of Hans Breitmann.' A fellow-passenger asked 
me, ' Is that your book ? ' I innocently replied ' Yes.' 
' Excuse me, sir,' cried another, ' it is mine.' ' I beg 
your pardon,' I replied, <but it is really mine.' 'Sir, I 
bought it.' I don't care if you did,' I replied, ' it is 
mine for I wrote it.' There was a roar of laughter, 
and we all became acquainted at once." 

Relating his experiences at Venice, Mr. Le- 
land gives some amusing instances of the pro- 
verbial linguistic ingenuity of the Italians. 

" I have spoken of having met Mr. Wright at Heidel- 
berg. He was from Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania. The 
next day after my arrival I found among the names of 
the departed, 'Signore Wright- Kilkes, from Barre, 
Pennsylvania, America.' This reminded me of the An- 
glo-American who was astonished at Rome at receiving 
invitations and circulars addressed to him as ' Illustris- 
simo Varanti Solezer.' It turned out that an assistant, 
reading aloud to the clerk the names from the trunks, 
had mistaken a very large ' Warranted Sole Leather ' 
for the name of the owner." 

The author's closing chapter, headed " En- 
gland," contains some piquant gossip touching 
literary and other notabilities, Tennyson, 
Lewes, George Eliot, Lord Lytton, Lord 
Houghton, Dorc, George Borrow, etc., from 
which we may select the following account of 
an encounter with Carlyle as a fitting finale. 
Mr. Leland met the inflammable sage at the 
Chelsea house, and he seems to have fairly 
given him a Roland for his Oliver. He says : 

" I can only remember that for the first twenty or 
thirty minutes Mr. Carlyle talked such a lot of skimble- 



skamble stuff and rubbish, which sounded like the very 
debris and lees of his ' Latter-Day Pamphlets,' that I 
began to suspect he was quizzing me, or that this was 
the manner in which he ladled out Carlyleism to visitors 
who came to be Carlyled and acted unto." 

It was pretty evident that the philosopher was 
out of humor and that a row was imminent. 
It quickly came about. After preliminary spar- 
ring (in ring parlance), Mr. Carlyle let fall 
something to the effect that " we had done noth- 
ing in America since Cromwell's Revolution 

of any importance." Then, says Mr. Leland, 

" A great rage came over me, and I remember very dis- 
tinctly that there flashed through my mind in a second 

the reflection, ' Now if I have to call you a d d old 

fool for saying that, I will; but I'll be even with you.' 
When as quickly the following inspiration came, which 
I uttered, and I suspect somewhat energetically: 'Mr. 
Carlyle, I think that niy brother, Henry Leland, who 
got the wound from which he died standing by my side 
in the war of the rebellion, fighting against slavery, was 
worth ten of my old Puritan ancestors; at least he died 
in a ten times better cause. And allow 'me to say, Mr. 
Carlyle, that I think that in all matters of historical 
criticism you are principally influenced by the merely 
melodramatic and theatrical.' Here Mr. Carlyle, look- 
ing utterly amazed and startled, though not at all an- 
gry, said, for the first time, in broad Scotch ' Whot 's 
that ye say ? ' 'I say, Mr. Carlyle,' I exclaimed with 
rising wrath, 'that I consider that in all historical judg- 
ments you are influenced only by the melodramatic and 
theatrical.' A grim smile as of admiration came over 
the stern old face. Whether he really felt the justice 
of the hit I know not, but he was evidently pleased at 
the manner in which it was delivered, and it was with 
a deeply reflective and not displeased air that he re- 
plied ' Na, na, I 'm nae that.' It was the terrier that 
had ferociously attacked the lion, and the lion was 
charmed. From that instant he was courteous, com- 
panionable, and affable, and talked as if we had been 
long acquainted, and as if he liked me." 

But we have already poached enough on Mr. 
Leland's preserves to tempt the reader thither- 
ward. The volume is outwardly attractive, and 
it contains a fair portrait of the author.

planned by members of the faculty of Columbia 
College. Professor Burgess's " Comparative 
Constitutional Law " has already appeared, and

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



The plan is in the line of present thinking 
on the subject of political science in the United 
States. We have long been dominated by En- 
glish ideas. We shall doubtless always find 
in those ideas the norm of our political insti- 
tutions. And yet many things that have come 
to us as a heritage of English histoi-y, hard 
won, sometimes, by English struggles for pop- 
ular liberties, are now in point of fact quite 
obsolete. Take for instance the right of peti- 
tion. It is one of the sacred privileges of an 
American citizen, embedded in our Constitu- 
tion among those other rights so precious to 
Anglo-Saxon freemen. And yet this choice 
guarantee of freedom is in fact as dead as 
Julius Ca3sar. It is utterly useless. Other ways 
of securing action and protecting rights have 
been devised, more in harmony with our modern 
methods. It is forgotten that petition to the 
crown was originally the only means by which 
the commonalty could initiate English legisla- 
tion calculated to redress grievances. But that 
custom has, centuries since, passed into obliv- 
ion, and now there is no popular demand which 
cannot readily be brought before Congress in 
the shape of a bill. Indeed, the few laws that 
come from our various legislative bodies are 
but a scanty survival of the swarm of meas- 
ures that have died in one house or the other. 
The problem now is, not how to secure consider- 
ation for a scheme of legislation, but how to pre- 
vent the enactment of the most of them. And 
to that end our bi-cameral system is certainly a 
blessing. It produces an extensive mortality 
among bills. And so our legislators do quite 
right in receiving petitions perfunctorily and 
then quietly depositing them in the legislative 
waste-basket. 

The world is nearer together than it was a 
century since. The social problems to be solved 
are not so different, after all, whether wrought 
out by Frenchman or Englishman or American. 
And we need all the fruit of all the experi- 
ence that civilized brains have worried through. 
Comparative politics recognizes this essential 
unity at least of European races. Perhaps the 
legal systems of people in the moon might be lit- 
tle more to us than a curiosity. But German 
and French institutions are merely Aryan ways 
of meeting difficulties and we are Aryans. 

With this broadening of human sympathies, 
then, our American isolation is lessening. We 
can learn from what others have done. And 
we may be sure that our learning is very in- 
complete if we limit it to Anglo-Saxon doings. 
The field of Administrative Law is not a small 



one. We have not been in the habit of con- 
sidering it by itself in America, though in Eu- 
rope it has long been a recognized branch of 
legal science. Our conception of the relation 
of the courts to administrative officials is dif- 
ferent. A dispute between officials, or a griev- 
ance of a citizen against an official, is brought 
before the same courts that take cognizance of 
ordinary civil cases. We do not think of any 
sacredness hedging about the administrative 
hierarchy that would keep its members from 
submitting to the usual jurisdictions. In France, 
however, administrative cases come before spe- 
cial courts, created ad hoc. The same consid- 
erations that keep one supreme court from 
considering political acts of the national legisla- 
ture, in the French view apply to all adminis- 
trative acts. In other words, the executive and 
judicial branches in that country are more 
really separate than with us. And this has 
perhaps with them helped widen the distinction 
between the two bodies of law. We have not 
heretofore made much of that distinction. 

However, our administrative system is very 
extensive and complex, and is growing more 
so with the development of the republic. We 
make much of our local self-government. And 
yet our various commonwealths States, we 
are pleased to call them are really highly 
centralized. Local communities have their 
affairs managed through agencies devised and 
modified and entirely revolutionized quite at 
the will of the central authorities. And local 
officials are usually the agents of the common- 
wealths for many purposes. At the same time, 
the central control is very weak in actual ad- 
ministration. The municipal treasurer is an 
officer of the state as well as of the city, and 
yet the state has only a weak hold on him. 
Further, our desire that the people shall be in 
close touch with the administrative system has 
led to a multiplication of offices with little or no 
salary attached. We secure popular govern- 
ment, but at the sacrifice too often of efficiency. 
Thus we have really a curious jumble in our 
system of managing the public business ad- 
ministrative centralization and local independ- 
ence all tangled together. 

It is clear enough that our whole machinery 
needs overhauling and improving. And to do 
that with success we need to know definitely 
just what legal relations have grown up among 
us, and how the other great nations manage 
the same things. To this end Professor Good- 
now's study in comparative politics is a valuable 
contribution.

The first of the two volumes details the or- 
ganization of the administrative systems in 
France, Germany, Great Britain, and the 
United States, the same four nations se- 
lected by Professor Burgess for his " Compar- 
ative Constitutional Law." This seems rather 
a large proportion of the work to devote to a 
preliminary analysis. And yet perhaps less 
could hardly have been done in the present 
state of political science. The basis of this part 
of the work is Professor Burgess's book, with 
that of Howard on the " Local Constitutional 
History of the United States." These are sup- 
plemented in a scholarly way by researches of 
others, and by ample investigation of judicial de- 
cisions. The analysis is a very clear one, and has 
a value quite independent of its relation to what 
follows. One who desires a good idea of the 
working system of administering government 
among the great nations can do no better than 
to read Professor Goodnow's first volume. In 
general, the statements of facts are very accu- 
rate. Perhaps exception might be taken to a 
remark on page 76. In speaking of the ap- 
pointing power in the State of New York, and 
of the old Council of Appointment, the author 
says : 

" Here the Governor had the power to appoint most 
officers in the commonwealth, but was subject in the 
exercise of the power to the necessity of obtaining the 
consent of the Council of Appointment formed of mem- 
bers of the Senate elected by the Assembly. In 1801, 
however, the power was given to each member of the 
Council to nominate for appointment." 

This is true, and perhaps all that is essential 
for the purposes intended. Still, it is calcu- 
lated to mislead one as to the facts. The 
New York constitution of 1777 provided (Art. 
XXIII.) for the choice of a Council of Ap- 
pointment, as follows : 

"The Assembly shall, once in every year, openly 
nominate and appoint one of the Senators from each 
great district,* which Senators shall form a council for 
the appointment of the said officers, of which the Gov- 
ernor . . . shall be president and have a casting voice, 
but no other vote; and with the advice and consent of 
the said council, shall appoint all the said officers; and 
that a majority of the said council be a quorum." 

The construction given this clause in the 
early years of the constitution vested in the 
governor the exclusive right to nominate, and 
restricted the councillors to voting, thus giving 
" advice and consent " on such nominations. 
But in 1794 the Federalists chose three of the 
four councillors, and this majority insisted that 
under the constitution they had a right of nom- 
inating concurrently with the governor. As 
* There were four great districts in the State. 



the governor, George Clinton, was a Repub- 
lican, it was obvious that this new construction 
would enable the Federalists to control all the 
appointments. They insisted on their point, 
against the protest of Governor Clinton, and 
thus secured the appointment of a Federalist 
as Supreme Court judge. The following year 
(1795) a Federalist governor, John Jay, was 
elected, and for several years there was no oc- 
casion for a difference of opinion in the coun- 
cil. But in 1800 the Republicans again secured 
the state legislature, and of course a majority 
in the Council of Appointment ; and so the 
tables were turned. It was now the Repub- 
licans who insisted that the constitution meant 
to give the members of the council a concur- 
rent right of nomination with the governor, 
and the Federalists who bitterly opposed. This 
collision resulted in an act of the legislature 
recommending a constitutional convention, 
which should have as one purpose to determine 
the true construction of the twenty-third arti- 
cle of the constitution. This convention was 
held accordingly, and adopted as its fifth arti- 
cle the following : 

" And this convention do further . . . ordain, de- 
termine, and declare, that by the true construction of 
the twenty-third article of the constitution of this state 
the right to nominate all officers ... is vested con- 
currently in the person administering the government 
of this state for the time being and in each of the mem- 
bers of the council of appointment." 

Thus the action of this convention was not 
the addition of a new power to those held by 
the council, but merely the judicial construc- 
tion of its powers under the constitution as it 
stood. It must be admitted, however, that the 
construction thus given was rather a violent 
one, and probably not at all what was intended 
by the framers of the constitution of 1777. 

Professor Goodnow (page 98) takes the usual 
ground that the English crown has lost the veto 
power. He is certainly safer in this view than 
his colleague, Professor Burgess, who has an 
ingenious but rather nebulous theory that the 
power might still be exercised. Perhaps it 
might. But as it is fairly certain that it never 
will be, the hypothesis can hardly be called a 
working one in practical politics. 

Attention is called by a passing remark 
(page 204) to the fact that " the courts of sev- 
eral of the commonwealths [of the United 
States] have held that the preservation of the 
peace is not a municipal function." The time 
will come when this truth will have wider rec- 
ognition. A local police, managed by local 
politicians too often directly dependent on the

criminal classes, can hardly be expected to be 
independent of local influences. The mainte- 
nance of order should have its source in a 
jurisdiction wider than any city or any county. 
We shall come to this in time. 

Volume II. treats of " Legal Relations." In 
other words, this is the treatise on Administra- 
tive Law for which the first volume merely 
clears the way. The three divisions are, " The 
Law of Officers," " The Administration in Ac- 
tion," and " The Control over the Administra- 
tion." The last division is treated the most co- 
piously, as is natural. The American student 
of politics will find no greater interest than in 
the chapter on " The Administrative Jurisdic- 
tion in France." The principles of Montesquieu 
relating to the separation of pqwers have no- 
where else been carried to their logical end as 
they have in France. The French administra- 
tive courts that have resulted are well worth 
our study. 

The machinery of government in the United 
States is far from perfect. It needs overhaul- 
ing at many points, as has been said. And to 
do that intelligently there must be general 
knowledge of other methods, as well as of our 
own. As a contribution to this knowledge, Pro- 
fessor Goodnow's book will be cordially wel- 



comed. 



HARRY PRATT JUDSON. 



A PONDEROUS BIOGRAPHY.* 

It is a good deal to devote two volumes, of 
about five hundred closely-printed pages each, 
to the first half of anybody's life. Dr. Pusey's 
career was interesting and important, but he 
was hardly one of those salient historic person- 
alities whose every word and deed should be 
permanently recorded. With all his abund- 
ant gifts, Canon Liddon has lacked a sense of 
proportion. Dr. Pusey loomed before him a 
little larger than he really was. Not every 
scrap from his pen was precious. Canon Lid- 
don died before the final revision of this work, 
yet there is no reason to think that its scale 
had been diminished had he lived himself to 
issue it. The result is somewhat excessive. 
Accumulated details do not always add to the 
impression. We cannot help thinking that this 
is one of the instances which Hesiod antici- 
pated when he said that the half had been more 
than the whole. 

*THE LIFE OF EDWARD BOUVERIE PUSEY. By Henry 
Parry Liddon. In two volumes. New York: Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 



Hitherto the Tractarian movement has been 
singularly happy in those who have portrayed 
it. Mozley's Reminiscences are as lively gossip 
as Pepys's Diary. Dean Burgon's Twelve Good 
Men were not evaporated and desiccated saints, 
but a round dozen of characters, brim-full of 
human nature. Ward's life 'by his son is a 
striking portraiture of an extraordinary person 
a "freak " or " sport " in the ecclesiastical 
garden. Newman's " Apologia " is almost an 
English classic. Dean Church's review of the 
Oxford Movement is rich in delightful matter. 
But Liddon's life of Pusey, while it may stand 
on the same shelf with Church and Ward and 
Burgon and Mozley and Newman, will not 
share their longevity. We seem to hear Bur- 
gon whisper to Mozley, behind Newman's back, 
" Not altogether a work of inspiration, and per- 
haps slightly protracted eh ? " and if departed 
shades are still capable of critical estimates, 
Dean Church may be seen to smile in genial 
acquiescence. Yet this is the life of one placed 
in the central current of a great religious move- 
ment, a movement which has influenced for 
good or ill perhaps for good and ill the 
Anglican Communion for a half century. It is 
strange that of the three chiefs of Tractarian- 
ism no one should have had a striking biog- 
raphy, neither Keble nor Newman, nor, as now, 
Dr. Pusey. 

There are all sorts of memoirs. There are 
those that seize the very man and transfer him 
bodily to the printed page. So Johnson lives 
in Boswell, and Scott in Lockhart, and Ma- 
caulay in Trevelyan. Others distil the finer 
essence of the man, yet the work lacks body. 
So certain delicate artists manage to miss the 
outward features of their sitter while yet elic- 
iting his soul. Thus Maurice's life by his son 
may be called a memoir of a disembodied spirit. 
The prophet, as his disciples loved to call him, 
is there ; but the man who paid taxes, and went 
to market, and had his little tempers and ab- 
surdities, hardly comes to the surface. And 
there are memoirs like Masson's life of Mil- 
ton, where you lose the figure in the landscape, 
the person in the period, and are rather sur- 
prised when from time to time he emerges. 

As writers differ, so subjects differ. There 
are men who lend themselves naturally to vivid 
presentation, who suggest lines of caricature to 
their enemies, and photographic sharpness of 
light and shadow to their friends ; whose hu- 
mors are representative, who are very like 
themselves and very much of their own opin- 
ion ; men whom you love or detest, but cannot

easily ignore or forget ; men of caprice and 
quaintness like Lamb, of robust sense and non- 
sense like Montaigne, men of mingled contra- 
dictions like Swift or Carlyle, men of blood 
and iron like Cromwell or Bismarck, men of 
genius interwrought with goodness and humor 
like Scott or Lowell. And there are other men, 
who, in whatever glare of publicity they may 
be standing, whatever cause they are forward- 
ing, however they may seem to be leading, yet 
somehow evade scrutiny, lack distinction, puz- 
zle observation ; men who may be even great 
in a sort, yet are always a little tiring in their 
greatness ; who, clad in every virtue, are after 
all but half visible. Those who are not of their 
inner circle are tempted to describe them as 
" good men in the worst acceptation of the 
word." You may esteem and reverence them, 
but can go no farther. For your life, you can- 
not approach them with any familiar liking. 
Alone on a desert island you might be grateful 
for their company, but with inward hesitancies 
and reservations. 

Somewhat of this latter sort must have been 
the late Dr. Pusey. One of his disciples speaks 
of him as "so awful a person." This is not 
at all the view which Dr. Liddon meant to give 
of him, but it is the impression left on read- 
ing these volumes of his biography. They 
portray not so much a man as an ecclesiastic, 
a schoolman, a body of divinity. He has hardly 
personal traits ; rather, he is marked by theo- 
logical tendencies. He has a subtle if not 
always a lucid intellect, a fervid rather than a 
luminous power of expression, an energetic and 
imperative conscience, a positive and tenacious 
will, a warm affection for a few persons, and 
an ardent passion for several abstract ideas ; 
but there seems not very much flesh and blood 
to him. He has a defined outline, but you 
doubt his possession of the usual three dimen- 
sions. You might sketch him in pen-and-ink, 
or bite him in with acid on copper ; but you 
could hardly model him all round in clay, or 
paint him with a full pallette in body color. 
You wonder if you tickle him would he laugh 
if you prick him would he bleed ? The 
very supposition seems incongruous. 

Nor was any such lack of vitality in the sub- 
ject likely to be made good by a superabund- 
ance of vitality in the painter. The art of Lid- 
don is not that of Rubens or of Tintoret. It 
is academic always, like that of the Caracci. 
While he was undoubtedly an able man, a 
learned and devout man, a man of eloquence 
and enthusiasm, a fervid rhetorician, he was 



not at all a fresh or suggestive man. His mind, 
however richly stored, was of a dry and scho- 
lastic cast, dwelling in the atmosphere of school 
divinity and ecclesiasticism, rather than of phil- 
osophic thought or spiritual intuition. The soil 
is highly cultivated, but not originally fertile. 
There is not a touch of saving humor or pen- 
etrative imagination in either biographer or 
subject of the biography. In all these thou- 
sand pages one hardly comes upon a striking 
illustration, a revealing anecdote, or a quotable 
passage. The reader's mind is kept on an un- 
broken level. The tone is that of intense se- 
riousness, unrelieved by any momentary play 
of thought. No one, it is said, was ever so wise 
as Lord Thurlow looked. Was anyone, it may 
be asked, ever so undeviatingly solemn as Dr. 
Pusey is made to appear throughout these pon- 
derous volumes ? When his children enter the 
drawing-room after dinner, it is Newman who 
frolics with them and tells them quaint stories ; 
it is not Pusey. One is compelled to wonder 
if he never encountered his fellow Tractarian 
Ward, or caught a twinkle in the eye of Moz- 
ley ? Was he always in such deadly earnest ? 
Could not even the irony of events extort from 
him a smile ? Was " The Great Man " always 
so impressed with the consciousness of his part 
on the stage of church history, his immediate 
responsibility for the safe conduct of his pe- 
riod, as never to unbend ? That title which in 
Greek Newman bestowed upon Pusey, Henry 
Wilberforce had already more fittingly be- 
stowed upon Newman. Perhaps when he went 
over to the Roman Communion he desired to 
beque*ath it to his successor in the Tractarian 
leadership. Certainly Pusey had one element 
of greatness the steady head which could let 
him stand on the very edge of a precipice and 
look fondly over, without the final leap or 
plunge. On the whole, there are those who 
could say of Dr. Pusey that he was not great 
so much as weighty a word conveying at once 
two ideas : influential and ponderous, neither 
quite inapplicable to the subject of this memoir. 
Why was he so widely influential? It is 
not an easy matter from this biography to dis- 
cover. It was probably due to several com- 
bining conditions. He was a man of high so- 
cial position, with family connection with the 
nobility ; a man of large means and large muni- 
ficence, of saintly devotion, of ascetic habit, of 
rare intensity of purpose, of special aptitude 
for business, and of a certain very English 
moderation in judgment. He could hold ex- 
treme views, yet be content without pushing 



16

them to extreme consequences. The logic of 
his intellect did not override the caution of 
his procedure. When more brilliant and more 
logical minds flashed out of Anglicanism, whose 
foundations no longer seemed to them trust- 
worthy, into the Roman Communion towards 
which their growing convictions pointed them, 
Dr. Pusey could admit their premises without 
accepting their conclusion, could skim over thin 
ice without recognizing its insufficiency to sup- 
port him, could rest on foundations which he 
himself had helped to undermine, as if they 
were of bedded adamant. When Ward and 
Newman and Oakley and Manning discovered 
that what they held most precious lay upon the 
farther side of the line that marked the boun- 
dary between Rome and Canterbury, Dr. Pusey 
could remain in the English Church and pre- 
pare Roman manuals for Anglican use with 
placid imperturbability. He suffered, but kept 
his composure. So, after the loss of Werter, 
Charlotte went on cutting bread and butter. 
Where logic called for suicide, Saxon sense 
preferred serviceableness. Nothing is so con- 
genial to the British mind as a logical contra- 
diction practically justified and disregarded. 
In our mother church and island to hold 
that two and two makes four, and to decline to 
take any further steps in that arithmetical pro- 
gression, is always regarded as wisdom and dis- 
cretion. It stamps upon its holder the imprint 
of sound and safe and sober. Such men be- 
come influential by force of their very limita- 
tions. Such a delicate and able equilibrium 
of eager courage and patient caution, of pro- 
found convictions and suspended application 
of them, is always interesting, and nowhere 
more successful in the conduct of life than 
among English churchmen. 

Perhaps another secret of Dr. Pusey's lead- 
ership was his entire absorption in ecclesias- 
tical and theological interests. Unless Dr. Lid- 
don has done him strange injustice, he was 
always " clasped like a missal " against all the 
outside light or dust that might penetrate his 
cloister. Here is a life whose course was syn- 
chronous with the dawn of modern science 
and the revival of modern literature ; yet in 
the copious correspondence with close friends 
throughout these volumes, from early child- 
hood to middle life, but for a reference to Byron 
as an injurious element in his youth, and an oc- 
casional reference to Keble and that more to 
the theological than to the poetic value of " The 
Christian Year," there is hardly a suggestion 
that Pusey ever read other than theological 



treatises or controversial pamphlets. Scholar 
as he was, there is no hint of his delight in the 
classics, whether Greek or Latin. He was 
careless of graces of style. He was indifferent 
to the charms of literature. He was unobservant 
of the march of science. He was unconcerned 
with the development of art or music. He built 
churches, but displays no taste for architecture. 
The one thing that interested him was patris- 
tic theology in its impress upon the institu- 
tion of which he was a part, the Church of 
England. That sort of concentration is always 
power. It gives force and intensity in a nar- 
row track. Dr. Pusey, though more of a man, 
had been less of a leader, if his mind had 
coursed over a wider field. He would have 
seen ideas in truer proportions, but he had been 
less the centre and head of Tractarian influence 
than he was for a generation from the day that 
John Henry Newman, after long hesitancy, 
finally passed over to Rome. 

Dr. Liddon well describes Dr. Pusey's long 
life, which began on August 22, 1800, and 
lasted until September 16, 1882, as " singularly 
uneventful, a continuous stream of lectures, 
sermons, letters, interviews." The interviews 
have left no trace save in the characters and 
lives of those whom they influenced. The let- 
ters are not sprightly, graphic, nor luminous. 
For the outpouring of an energetic mind, in 
free communication with familiar friends, they 
are remarkably formal and uninteresting. You 
feel with what justice their author could say of 
himself, referring to his personal temperament 
and Walloon ancestry, " You know I am phleg- 
matic, and, indeed, Dutch." The sermons and 
lectures are before the world. Newman's are 
classics though Lowell could not relish them, 
though their highly- wrought rhetoric may pos- 
sibly be less valued when the present genera- 
tion passes from the stage and the glamour of 
their author's personality has been dissipated. 
But Pusey's sermons and lectures are already 
obsolescent. There is a certain beauty of holi- 
ness, a tender sweetness, about his first volume 
of parochial discourses. The substance of the 
lectures, as contained in the volumes on Daniel 
and the Minor Prophets, later exegetes respect- 
fully recognize. Yet it is in the Tractarian 
school that Dr. Pusey continues to be an au- 
thority, rather than among Christian scholars 
at large. His vogue is past. No new editions 
of his works are called for. His scholarly pres- 
tige is traditional and not a living force. 

He and the men of his time were heated 
pamphleteers and intolerant polemics. The

day for such intensity of controversy in the 
church arena is happily ended. Men as op- 
posed as Newman and Arnold, as Hampden 
and Pusey, have learned to set less store on 
the things wherein they differ. On public plat- 
forms and in church newspapers, they may fling 
about the old vituperations ; but they do it 
from force of bad habit, and mean very little 
by them. Their sting has been blunted and 
their virus neutralized. For the most part, 
people respect one another's liberty and toler- 
ate their mutual diversities. Yet in one re- 
spect, perhaps, we have degenerated. It was 
once a battle of scholars and thinkers in the 
region of convictions and ideas. It is now 
a commotion on a lower level. The Tract- 
arian is departed, and the Ritualist is with us. 
Now a tract is not an imposing weapon, but it 
is of more weight than a ceremonial. What to 
believe is a serious concern. How to behave 
in the chancel is a histrionic controversy. Per- 
haps the day is at hand when good men will 
remember with shame that once such trifles 
were magnified, that what has been admirably 
called the mere " etiquette of religion " once 
divided those who should be brethren.

Ax AMERICAN SCHOOL-TEACHER ix 
JAP AX. * 

The ability to see things in a foreign land 
as they really are, and not as they are distorted 
by the blinding pride of race or religion, is a 
rare gift. It implies intelligent and sympa- 
thetic appreciation of the qualities which, in 
spite of outward differences, make " the whole 
world kin." The possession of this ability in 
a marked degree by the author of " A Japan- 
ese Interior " lends distinction to the series of 
letters in which she relates her experiences 
during a year's residence in Tokyo. Their 
freedom from bias is indeed remarkable. As 
one of the teachers in a school for girls of no- 
ble birth, under the management of the Impe- 
rial Household Department and the personal 
patronage of the Empress, Miss Bacon had 
unusual opportunities. Of these she made ex- 
cellent use. Her life in Tokyo was spent almost 
entirely among the Japanese and apart from 
the foreign colony. The letters, which do not 
appear to have been written with a view to pub- 
lication, testify to a desire to accommodate her-

of "Japanese Girls and Women." Boston : Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co. ~ 



self in every way to the manners and customs 
of the people about her, so far as this could be 
done without the sacrifice of her own individ- 
uality. Etiquette among the upper classes in 
Japan demands familiarity with many conven- 
tional observances and calls for much deferen- 
tial bowing. How Miss Bacon regarded this 
is shown by a characteristic incident, her ac- 
count of which is worth repeating. Having 
received an invitation to see the feast of dolls 
at the house of one of the Tokugawa daimios 
one of the few places in Tokyo where the old- 
time etiquette is still kept up she felt it in- 
cumbent to prepare herself beforehand. 

" Mind gave me a little instruction in the art of get- 
ting down on my knees and putting my forehead to the 
floor, but the present style of American dress makes it 
very hard to do the thing gracefully, and my joints are 
a good deal too stiff to allow me to be comfortable dur- 
ing the process. However, I did it after a fashion, and 
felt very much like a fool in doing it, but it seemed ne- 
cessary for me to show my appreciation of the kindness 
that had been shown me by being polite in some man- 
ner that my entertainers could recognize. Our good 
manners are so undemonstrative that only a few for- 
eignized Japanese can discover that we have any at all, 
and the usual result of an effort here in Japan to copy 
foreign manners is a complete disregard of all rules of 
politeness, whether Japanese or foreign." 

Miss Bacon's sojourn in Japan was not ex- 
tended enough to enable her to become thor- 
oughly familiar with all the intricacies of Jap- 
anese etiquette, but her observations in regard 
to it are nevertheless interesting. Toward the 
end of her stay she writes : 

" It is rather a curious experience for me out here, 
that in my associations with those about me I am 
' neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.' I am 
too Japanese for the foreigners, and too foreign for the 
Japanese ; too worldly for the missionaries, and not 
worldly enough for the rest of the foreign colony ; and 
so, with the exception of my intimate Japanese friends, 
there is no one in Tokyo who does not seem to regard 
me as rather out of their line." 

Although the author states in the preface 
that her book is " not intended as an authority 
on Japan in general, or on any particular phase 
of life there," no better or more reliable account 
of the things that came within her observation 
has yet been -written. It does not pretend to 
be more than a daily chronicle of events, sights, 
and impressions, a record of passing thoughts 
rather than the result of mature deliberation. 
As such, however, it is a delightful book, writ- 
ten in a simple style and free from affectation. 
While a longer residence in the country would 
doubtless have caused some of the comments to 
be modified, they are for the most part well- 
considered. Occasionally she makes an over-

statement, as when she says of the Japanese 
laborer that he has his aesthetic nature " fully" 
developed. Neither in Japan nor Europe nor 
America is this literally true of any but the 
very few. As compared with the similar class 
elsewhere, however, the Japanese laborer is in 
this respect immeasurably in advance. Miss 
Bacon's remarks upon this point are so singu- 
larly just that we cannot forbear quoting them : 
" With him, < life is more than meat,' it is beauty as 
well; and this love of beauty has upon him such a civ- 
ilizing effect that some people are led to think that the 
lower classes in Japan do not need Christianity. But 
when one comes to study them, they are not more moral 
than our lower classes; they are not as moral; they are 
only more gentle, more contented, more civilized I 
should say, except that the word ' civilization ' is so dif- 
ficult to define and to understand that I do not know 
what it means now as well as I did when I left home."

occasion, of christening a book " That Beautiful 
Wretch," for which offence it would take more than 
one "Daughter of Heth" or "Princess of Thule " 
to atone. Most of Mr. Black's novels belong to 
the class that are produced by merely shuffling the 
well-worn cards of the game, and the one now at 
hand offers no exceptions to this rule. Its master- 
cards are the Jean Valjean story of self-effacement 
in the interests of a beloved daughter, and the Mar- 
guerite Duval story of the austere parent's plea to 
spare a cherished son the degradation of stepping 
down a rung or two upon the social ladder. Let 
us add that the descent contemplated is not deep 
enough to be tragic, and that the hero has manli- 
ness enough to make it. Here we are for an instant 
minded of " A Princess of Thule," but marriage 
does not, in this case, change a gentleman into a 
cad. The story is rather more pleasing than most 
of Mr. Black's recent ventures ; it is well provided 
with incident, dramatic upon occasion, sparkling in 
the flow of its narrative. It is pathetic without be- 
ing emotional, and its tone is cultivated without be- 
ing priggish. 

Some time ago the newspapers were busily in- 
forming the public that Mr. Rider Haggard had 
gone to Mexico to collect the materials for a new 
story. The story is now published, is called "Mon- 
tezuma's Daughter," and justifies the pains taken 
by the author in making his observations on the 
spot. We have no doubt that he could have made 
nearly as good a story out of Prescott and the other 
books, but there are numerous chapters in which his 
personal experience stands him in good stead, and 
the story is both graphic and exciting, although it 
has no style worth speaking of, and although its 
conception of plot is about on the level of that dis- 
played by Captain Mayne Reid in his numerous 
romances. More than once, in fact, Mr. Haggard 
reminds us of a Mayne Reid redivivus, although he 
seems to have had Kingsley's "Westward Ho!" in 
sight during the composition of the book. The 
story is mostly Mexican, and tells of the invasion 
of Cortes ; but there are antecedent passages in 
England and Spain, for the hero is an English ad- 
venturer who finds his way through Spain to Mex- 
ico on a vengeful quest. The vengeance is certainly 
satisfactory when it comes, but is not reached until 
the hero has had as surprising a series of perils and 
escapes as even the fertile imagination of the author 
ever devised. The spelling of Aztec names has 
been considerably shortened for the infant mind, 
and " Popocatapetl " is reduced to "Popo." But 
does not Mr. Haggard know that the infant mind, 
bent upon geographical lore, simply delights in the 
name of Popocatapetl, and would not for a wilder- 
ness of monkeys have it abbreviated? 

"Richard Escott" is both the title of a story and 
the name of the preposterous villain about whom it 
centres. He is the son of a noble lord and cabinet 
minister, but is likewise a blackleg, a cardsharper, 
and an unspeakable cad. His operations are mostly

carried on in Paris, where he plays with his friends 
a queer game called " poker," in which you can draw 
to a hand at least twice, "rise" your opponents at 
pleasure, and use the deuce of spades as a "joker." 
The record of Escott's villainies is dreary and un- 
relieved, and the story is put together with but 
slight constructive art. The death of the hero is a 
relief, both because it satisfies the moral sense and 
because the book has to end with it. 

' A Gentleman of France " is a historical romance 
of the times of Henry of Navarre. Its action is 
placed in the period when the last of the Valois 
kings has taken refuge at Blois, and ends with his 
assassination. The two Henrys figure conspicuously 
in the narrative, which is as full of stirring adven- 
tures as a Christmas pudding of plums, and quite as 
good as Dumas. The hero is a reduced but very 
valiant gentleman, and the heroine is a young gen- 
tlewoman who at first spurns him as Enid spurned 
Geraint, but whose pride melts into love when the 
proper time comes, and who is altogether fascinat- 
ing. Like Dr. Doyle's ' The White Company " and 
" The Refugees," which it much resembles, Mr. 
Weyman's story makes extremely vivid the chapter 
of French history with which it deals. Such books 
show clearly that Scott is still a power in English 
fiction, and that the analysts and realists are not to 
have things entirely their own way. 

Diana Tempest is the daughter of Colonel Tem- 
pest, a spendthrift guardsman who would have suc- 
ceeded his brother in the Overleigh estate had it 
not been for John Tempest, that brother's reputed 
son, upon whom the estate devolved. In point of 
fact, John is an illegitimate son, and the fact is 
known to all concerned excepting the child himself. 
Whereupon the uncle brings an action against the 
estate, but is, of course, defeated. He then listens 
to the promptings of an evil genius named Swayne, 
and lays ten wagers, each of a thousand pounds to 
a sovereign, that he will never succeed to Overleigh. 
Presently, Colonel Tempest is sorry for what he 
has done, and feels something like remorse. But 
at this juncture Swayne most inopportunely dies, 
and his partner in crime then discovers that the 
ten bets have been transferred to as many persons, 
and is unable to trace them and take them up. At 
this point the reader has the fascinating prospect 
of ten mysterious attempts to murder John, and at 
least nine hairbreadth escapes. But these reason- 
able anticipations are not fulfilled, for, after four of 
the unknown takers of the wager have failed to 
" remove " their victim and win the Colonel's money, 
the Colonel concludes to take his, own life and thus 
deprive the other six (whoever they may be) of 
their occupation. The readers of the story will all 
agree with the balked assassins that to do this was 
to take a mean advantage of them. In the mean- 
while, John has grown up, unsuspicious of the dan- 
gers surrounding him (although mildly surprised at 
the frequency of the accidents he encounters), and 
has fallen in love with Diana. Presently, he dis- 



covers his illegitimacy, and, acting upon an absurdly 
quixotic impulse, determines to surrender the prop- 
erty which is both legally and morally his. This 
foolish proceeding is averted by the death of the 
Colonel and his scapegrace son,, thus leaving the 
question to be settled by Diana and John, which is 
not a difficult matter. It will be seen from this 
outline that the story is both ingenious and exciting ; 
we should add that the author has an incisive style 
and handles her materials with ease. 

A story that keeps the reader puzzled concerning 
its principal characters, and leaves him in the end 
uncertain as to what he shall think of them, is clearly 
lacking in one of the essentials of artistic work. 
Such a story is " What Necessity Knows," by Miss 
Dougall, whose "Beggars All" we reviewed about 
a year ago. Yet the book is made interesting by 
its divergence from the beaten path, and by a cer- 
tain force and delicacy which, although crudely em- 
bodied, are evident and unmistakable. An episode 
in the Millerite craze of 1843 is the central situa- 
tion, and this unpromising material is worked up 
with considerable insight. The scene is laid in 
Canada, and the characters are, for the most part, 
English settlers in that country. There are a great 
number of prosy pages that might profitably have 
been condensed or left out altogether. 

Mr. Chatfield-Taylor's second novel is a distinct 
advance upon his first. In construction, in charac- 
ter delineation, and in grasp of its materials, it of- 
fers a marked improvement upon its predecessor, 
and may fairly claim to be taken seriously, a claim 
that was hardly to be made in behalf of " With 
Edge Tools." There are faults, of course, and 
marks of the prentice hand. The writer's style is 
very defective, and calls for a closer attention than 
he has given it as yet. Obscure, ill-balanced, and 
slip-shod sentences are of frequent occurrence. Sev- 
eral of the characters exhibit inconsistencies that 
produce a patch-work effect, and the hero, on at 
least one occasion, carries frankness to the point of 
naivete and even beyond, producing an impression 
clearly different from anything that could have been 
in the author's intention. But the merits of the 
book are considerable. It holds the interest from 
first to last, and many of the episodes are exceed- 
ingly well managed. The conversations consist 
largely of small talk and repartee, but they are sel- 
dom unnatural and nearly always clever. Some- 
times they are very clever indeed. " The English 
life depicted in the story is a somewhat superficial 
sketch," the writer remarks in his preface. This 
is undoubtedly true, but it is also true that superfi- 
cial sketches of life have their value, and that this 
one, which makes no unwarranted pretensions, 
needs no apologetic introduction. It was not a bad 
idea for the writer, having safely landed his hero 
and heroine upon English soil, to take them the 
rounds of social life, to crushes and house-parties 
and "meets," to Henley and Goodwood, as a device 
for providing his story with a pleasing variety of 



20

scenes. In spite of the attractiveness of this shift- 
ing background, the human relations woven into the 
story are of paramount interest, and the characters 
have considerable reality, although they appear, for 
the most part, in an artificial environment. We 
should add that the sentiment of the story is dis- 
tinctly wholesome. 

The " Coign of Vantage " from which Mr. Wood's 
harum-scarum story is told is an old Roman tower 
in the Valais, inhabited, for a few days, by a small 
party of tourists, bent upon a lark. It goes without 
saying that they are Americans, and that great is 
the surprise not to say consternation of inn- 
keeper and village folk when our tourists propose 
to divert the tower from its time-honored uses as a 
sight to be seen to an abode to be lived in. Installed 
in their romantic quarters, our tourists find their 
existence enlivened by a series of unexpected inci- 
dents, and soon become actors in a comedy of errors 
the scenes whereof are developed with slight regard 
to the probabilities or the conventionalities. The 
story has the usual matrimonial outcome, and is told 
not without cleverness and point. 

"In the Dwellings of Silence" is a romance of 
Russia and Siberian exile. As the treatment is no 
less hackneyed than the material, and as the book 
is rather carelessly written, comment is hardly called 
for. The horrors with which " Stepniak" and Mr. 
Kennan have made us acquainted are retailed in 
slightly intensified form, and we follow our political 
prisoners from Petropavlovsk to Kara, feeling all 
the time that we know just what will happen to them 
next. The story of their escape is ingeniously man- 
aged, and is much the most interesting part of the 
book. But the whole subject ought either to be 
shelved, or at least left to writers who have more than 
a hearsay knowledge of what Siberian exile means. 

" Tom Sylvester," Mr. T. R. Sullivan's first ven- 
ture in full-grown fiction, shows an intimate acquaint- 
ance with two things the home life of the New 
England town, and the social life of the American 
resident in Paris. The boyhood of the hero is so 
naturally and so sympathetically described that he 
reminds us not a little of another " Tom " the 
typical New England youngster of Mr. Aldrich's 
thinly disguised autobiography. Mr. Sullivan's hero, 
when he grows up, goes forth to see the world as it 
wags in the French capital, and acquires a fund of 
valuable experience. Presently he returns to his 
native village, marries an old-time playmate, and 
the rest is silence. The moral of the tale possibly 
a trifle forced is that America is the proper place 
for Americans, and that self-expatriation is mainly 
useful in helping one to appreciate what has been 
left behind. The book is as wholesome as it is 
interesting, and is an excellent repast to set before 
young not too young readers. 

Our collection of novels includes a group of four 
that are based, to a certain extent, upon the literary 
history of England, and derive no little of their 
interest from the well-known characters that figure 
in their pages. The first of these novels to which 



we will call attention is called " The Days of Lamb 
and Coleridge." The truth in this story much out- 
weighs the fiction, for nearly all the incidents were 
actual occurrences in the lives of this famous literary 
pair. The letters are printed verbatim, and even 
the conversations are to a certain extent pieced out 
from reported utterances. The Shelleys, Carlyle, 
and other writers are brought into the story, some- 
what irrelevantly. It is a pleasant performance, 
albeit an amateurish one. 

Sir Philip Sidney is the hero of " Penshurst 
Castle," a story by Mrs. Marshall, who is not un- 
known to readers of historical fiction. There is 
good stuff for romance in the life of Sidney, but 
the writer has idealized him almost out of all sem- 
blance of reality. The hero of Zutphen figures, in 
consequence, as a rather priggish sort of person, 
doubtless the last effect intended by his enthusiastic 
delineator. There is some history, dilute but accu- 
rate, in the narrative ; the Countess of Pembroke 
appears conspicuously, and we catch sight now and 
then of other well-known characters, including the 
Virgin Queen, the Earl of Leicester, and Sir Fulke 
Greville. The author's style walks upon stilts, but 
does not thereby escape from commonplace. 

" The Bailiff of Tewkesbury " is a romance of 
Elizabethan times, and no less a person than William 
Shakespeare figures among the characters. In the 
opening chapters we read of the midnight raid upon 
the Lucy preserves, and the haling of the young 
poacher before outraged magistracy. At this point, 
we wonder if the authors would be audacious enough 
to emulate Landor, and attempt once more what he 
did once for all. But the episode is passed lightly 
over, and the poet sets out for London, to appear 
henceforth but at momentary intervals upon the 
scene. The ostensible hero is one William Helpes, 
and the heroine is a niece of Sir Thomas Lucy. This 
Helpes is represented as the mysterious " W. H." 
of the sonnets, and to him, as their " only begetter," 
are a number of them sent, and thus deftly woven 
into the pretty tale. 

The last book of our literary-historical group is 
" Garrick's Pupil," a translation from the French. 
The central episode of the work is furnished by the 
Gordon Riots, and the adventures of a young actress, 
persecuted by a dissolute nobleman, provide the story 
with its main theme. Among the famous men to 
whom we are introduced may be mentioned Rey- 
nolds, Burke, Gibbon, Johnson, and Boswell. The 
story is an admirable picture of the times singu- 
larly so when considered as the work of a foreigner 
but is not oppressively historical. The translation 
is fair, but not always idiomatic. We read, for ex- 
ample, that a certain pickpocket " failed to relieve " 
Prince Orloff of a valuable snuff-box. This is easily 
recognized as a mistranslation offailli. On the same 
page we find bete noir, a common but inexcusable 
blunder.

varian aristocracy, who is at heart a worldling, but 
who persuades herself for a time into being a most 
schwdrmerisch idealist, witnesses the play, is fasci- 
nated by the actor who represents the Christ, secretly 
marries him, and takes him to her country estate, 
where he nominally lives as her steward. She soon 
tires of the relation, and resumes her society life, 
playing fast and loose with a nobleman who has long 
been her lover. The husband, in the meanwhile, 
after ten years of almost solitary life, ended by a 
scene of passionate upbraiding, returns to Ammer- 
gau, resumes his old part, but is soon brought to the 
point of death by the exhaustion that comes from a 
decade of spiritual suffering. At the very end, his 
wife comes to tardy recognition of her duty towards 
him, abandons society, and does her best to atone 
to him for her sin. This is the outline of a story 
which makes a distinctly unpleasant impression. It 
is emotional, and even hysterical ; it abounds in un- 
natural contrasts between different phases of the 
same character ; its morality comes dangerously near 
being sophistical ; and its blending of the religious 
with the sensual is, at its worst, fairly nauseating. 
As a depiction of the spirit in which the peasants of 
old Ammergau entered into their sacred work, it will 
be scoffed at by the cynic ; yet, in this regard, the 
work is probably more faithful to fact than in any 
other. 

With the publication of " Pan Michael," Mr. Cur- 
tin has completed his English translation of the great 
historical trilogy which we owe to the genius of Hen- 
ryk Sienkiewicz. The other divisions of this work, 
"With Fire and Sword" and "The Deluge," were 
reviewed by us at the time of their appearance, and 
we are now called upon to say a few words of their 
sequel. The Pan Michael of the title is, of course, 
the valiant little knight, Volodyovski, who figures 
conspicuously in the whole series. His further deeds 
of bravery are recounted in the present volume, 
which culminates in his heroic defence of Kamenyets 
and his death upon the ruins of that stronghold 
when treachery has finally given it into the hands 
of the pagan invader. Our old friend Zagloba, now 
past ninety, but as great a master as ever of wit and 
wordy valor, remains in view to the end. We have 
also occasional glimpses of other heroes of the pre- 
ceding volumes ; but many new figures crowd the 
canvas, and hold the attention in their turn. The 
greatest of these, historically, is that of John So- 
bieski, whose infrequent appearances upon the scene 
are managed with much impressiveness, although 
the most glorious episode in his career, his repulse 
of the Turks at Vienna, still lies ten years in the 
future at the time when this narrative closes. The 
struggle of the Polish Commonwealth with the Cos- 
sacks was the theme of "With Fire and Sword"; 
the struggle with the Swedish invader was the theme 
of " The Deluge." " Pan Michael " has for its theme 
the terrible Turkish war which made a king of So- 
bieski and of his name one of the greatest of histor- 
ical memories. The interest of the trilogy, both 
historical and romantic, is splendidly sustained in 



" Pan Michael," although the work contains fewer 
than its predecessors of those episodes like that 
of Zagloba in the loft or that of Skshetuski in the 
marshes at Zbaraj which no one that has once read 
can ever forget. Nor is its culminating episode of 
the siege of Kamenyets quite equal in impressive- 
ness to the magnificent account of the siege of Chen- 
stohova given us in " The Deluge." 

" Here ends this series of books, written in the 
course of a number of years and with no little toil, 
for the strengthening of hearts," says the author at 
the close of his epilogue. "This series of books" 
fills, in its English form, nearly twenty-six hundred 
large pages, and means an amount of writing about 
equal to half a dozen full-sized " Waverley " novels, 
or to the eleven volumes in which Dumas chron- 
icled the adventures of his moiisquetaires. It often 
happens that the amount of writing in a book is 
inversely proportional to its literary value, and this 
is particularly apt to be true of historical romance, 
as many German, and some English and American, 
examples testify. It is even true, to a certain extent, 
of the master achievement of Dumas ; but it is not 
true of Scott, and it is not true of the present author. 
From every point of view, this Polish trilogy de- 
serves to be ranked among the greatest of all works 
of historical fiction. It covers a period of only 
twenty-five years the third quarter of the seven- 
teenth century ; but it gives us of that period for 
the Polish Commonwealth a picture of unsurpassed 
vigor, fidelity, and interest. From the artistic stand- 
point, to have created the character of Zagloba was 
a feat comparable with Shakespeare's creation of 
Falstaff and Goethe's creation of Mephistopheles. 
The other heroes of the trilogy include several of 
the clearest-cut types, faithful to the traits of their 
respective races Pole, Tartar, and Cossack to be 
found anywhere in literature ; while in the delinea- 
tion of his heroines the author has shown equal skill 
discernment, and sympathy. We must look to the 
great masters for a gallery of equally noble and lov- 
able women. It seems, indeed, incongruous to dis- 
cuss a work of this sort in connection with a review 
of current fiction, so unmistakably does it detach 
itself from the multitude of ephemeral productions. 
The best of ordinary heroes seem but carpet-knights 
in comparison with these valiant warriors of Old 
Poland, as the best of ordinary heroines seem but 
boudoir or hot-house creations in comparison with 
the adorable women who make radiant these pages. 
The real secret of the Polish novelist's power is that 
he penetrates beneath the conventional surface of 
life whereupon most novelists find their element, and 
shows us men and women swayed by the primal im- 
pulses of the human soul. Love, patriotism, and reli- 
gion : these always have been and always will be the 
controlling motives, of sane and healthy humanity ; 
and these motives, heightened by the writer's artistic 
instinct, are given unchecked play in the work now 
happily completed. It is indeed, a work " for the 
strengthening of hearts."

BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 



Prof. Huxley's 
"Methods and 
Residti." 



Professor Huxley has set himself to 
re-arrange his miscellaneous papers 
of the last quarter-century into an 
edition of " Collected Essays" (Appleton), to be 
completed in nine volumes, one of which will be the 
"Hume" in the '-English Men of Letters" series. 
The first of these volumes, entitled " Method and 
Results," has just appeared. It includes his essay 
of 1870 on Descartes and his " Discours de la M- 
thode," the famous essay of 1868 on " The Physical 
Basis of Life," a group of recent political discussions, 
and a few others. What gives peculiar interest to 
the volume is the fact that these essays are prefaced 
by a brief autobiography, published a few years ago, 
but not, we think, generally known to the public. 
" Why I was christened Thomas Henry I do not 
know," says Mr. Huxley, " but it is a curious chance 
that my parents should have fixed for my usual de- 
nomination upon the name of that particular Apostle 
with whom I have always felt most sympathy." The 
manner of this sentence is characteristic of the entire 
sketch, which is genial and much too brief. It is 
difficult to realize that the writer has been a hypo- 
chondriacal dyspeptic nearly all his life, but such, 
he assures us, is the fact. Mr. Huxley, as all his 
readers know, is fond of posing as a plain blunt man, 
and this amusing affectation appears in the sketch 
before us. He is no orator, as Brutus is, and he 
often assures us that he is not. But we fancy that 
both he and Antony winked when they said it. The 
following is one of the closing passages : " The last 
thing that it would be proper for me to do would be 
to speak of the work of my life, or to say at the end 
of the day whether I think I have earned my wages 
or not. Men are said to be partial judges of them- 
selves. Young men may be, I doubt if old men are. 
Life seems terribly foreshortened as they look back, 
and the mountain they set themselves to climb in 
youth turns out to be a mere spur of immeasurably 
higher ranges, when, with failing breath, they reach 
the top. But if I may speak of the objects 1 have 
had more or less definitely in view since I began 
the ascent of my hillock, they are briefly these : To 
promote the increase of natural knowledge and to 
forward the application of scientific methods of 
investigation to all the problems of life to the best 
of my ability, in the conviction, which has grown 
with my growth and strengthened with my strength, 
that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of man- 
kind except veracity of thought and of action, and 
the resolute facing of the world as it is when the 
garment of make-believe by which pious hands have 
hidden its uglier features is stripped off."

gansett, attords us an interesting and 
unusually direct peep into colonial every-day life. 
" College Tom " was one Thomas Hazard (1720- 
1798), a rich Narragansett gentleman-farmer, the 



anti-slavery pioneer in his state ; and the present 
memoir is written and compiled by his grandson's 
granddaughter, Miss Caroline Hazard. Thomas 
Hazard owed his sobriquet to the fact that he spent 
several terms at New Haven College. The first two- 
thirds of the present volume consist of a rapid narra- 
tive of his after-life and transactions, in which the 
writer sticks as closely as possible to original records, 
many of which are given in fac-simile. Chief of them 
is " College Tom's " account-book a folio volume of 
two hundred pages, with entries (1750-1790) cov- 
ering the most active period of the diarist's life. 
The jottings are fairly regular and minute, and they 
are supplemented here and there by notes pinned 
to the written pages, the whole affording a very good 
idea of the home life and economy of a Narragan- 
sett planter. Inferentially, we are shown some of 
the beauties and advantages of " fiat " money - 
which seems, however, in Rhode Island, to have 
proved anything but a panacea for the ills it was 
meant to alleviate. Rhode Island issued paper 
money first in 1710, and six other issues followed 
between that date and 1740, when the outstanding 
bills of those dates began to be called " old tenor.'' 
Naturally, in the existing state of things, the credit- 
money depreciated with amazing rapidity and to a 
ludicrous degree, and the alarming prices in " Col- 
lege Tom's " account-book must be discounted ac- 
cordingly. In a memorandum of a horse-trade, for 
instance, we learn that one of the parties (combat- 
ants is the better word, perhaps) was to pay the 
other fifty-five pounds " to boot." This seems pretty 
extravagant even in a horse-trade, until one learns 
that in 1740 one silver shilling meant twelve and a 
half paper shillings ; a fact that reduces the fifty- 
five pounds " old tenor " to the modest sum of four 
pounds eight shillings. Miss Hazard has given us 
an altogether capital book, full of solid information, 
and very readable withal. There are some instruc- 
tive cuts of old documents, bank-bills, etc., and an 
appendix of one hundred pages, containing literal 
selections from "College Tom's" papers. The 
superb typography calls for special mention.

Embroidery," by May Morris; "Of Book Illustra- 
tion and Book Decoration," by Reginald Blomfield; 
and " On Designing for the Art of Embroidery," 
by Selwyn Image. Believing that the time had 
come when the designer and craftsman should make 
known their identity, which had usually been con- 
cealed behind the firm of So-and-So and Co., these 
exhibitions were opened that the real workers might 
be brought into touch with each other and with the 
public. It was thought that in this way the artist 
and the craftsman could more freely compare notes 
for their mutual improvement, and gain that recog- 
nition from their employers and the public which 
was their due. By the aid of new mechanical de- 
vices, and by that obnoxious commercial system 
called " competition," the artisan had been reduced 
to a very unimportant personage ; art and art man- 
ufacture had been cheapened, while the consumer 
had come to look upon the whole matter in the light 
of a purely business proposition, and made price 
rather than quality his object. To quote a para- 
graph from Mr. Crane's essay, this movement " is a 
protest against that so-called industrial progress 
which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of 
which is paid for by the lives of their producers 
and the degradation of their users." Each of the 
thirty-five essays that now make up the volume en- 
titled "Arts and Crafts Essays" is, as may be 
noted from those named, prepared by a specialist. 
Mr. William Morris provides an introduction ; and 
from the appearance of the book, which is imported 
for the American market by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons, we must infer that to him also is due a 
large share of the credit for its excellent paper and 
typography, and its outside dress of Irish linen. 

A very graphic and entertaining, and 
withal informing, book is " Aspects 
of Modern Oxford" (Macmillan). 
The author does not give his name, but he rather 
affectedly styles himself "A mere Don" a piece 
of mock humility that reads very much as if he had 
written himself " a mere Kaiser " sr " a mere Arch- 
bishop." When an Oxford Fellow speaks thus lightly 
of his dignity it may be put down as morally certain 
that he would be the last man of his corps to allow 
others to do it. The little book contains 135 pages ; 
and in this modest space is contained a capital ac- 
count of the lighter phases of current life at the centre 
of "port and prejudice," as Gibbon styled his quon- 
dam Alma Mater, written in a style savoring more 
of the brisk journalistic than the staid academic. 
The following extract from a chapter on " Under- 
graduates " may serve as a sample: " Of the hun- 
dreds of boys who are shot on the G. W. R. platform 
every October to be caressed or kicked by Alma 
Mater, and returned in due time full or empty, it 
is only an insignificant minority who come up with 
the ostensible purpose of learning. Their reasons

cause it is thought by his friends that he might get

stone to the professions which it fortunately is not 
as yet. Mr. Sangazur is going to St. Boniface be- 
cause his father was there ; and Mr. J. Sangazur 
Smith well, probably because Ms father wasn't. 
Altogether, they are a motley crew, and it is not 
the least achievement of the University that she does 
somehow or other manage to impress a certain stamp 
on so many different kinds of metal" a certain 
indefinable stamp, it may be added, of culture, or 
polish, or good-breeding, or whatever you choose to 
call it, that the grudging Philister resents, scolds 
at, sneers at, and even makes a feint of laughing 
at ; but which he, in fact, secretly chafes at and 
envies. The book is liberally and capitally illus- 
trated, and its tasteful typography merits special 
mention.

lessor Jfc 1 reeman are devoted, respect- 
ively, to " Greece " and " Italy." Their contents 
consist of short papers, written from ten to fifteen 
years ago, and contributed mainly to " The Saturday 
Review." Miss Florence Freeman has edited the 
collections, which are illustrated by a portrait of the 
author, and a pretty photogravure of the Parthenon. 
The volume on Greece takes us to Athens, Marathon, 
Tiryns, Argos, Mycenae, Corinth, Olympia, and a 
few other places. The volume on Italy has to do 
mostly with spots rarely visited by the tourist, but 
of great historical or archaeological interest, such as 
Veil, Ostia, Norba, and Segni. An " Iter ad Brun- 
disium " closes the volume. One's first impression, 
especially in reading the Italian sketches, is that 
they are mostly about walls. Freeman's architec- 
tural training gave him a peculiar interest in such 
things, and for finding sermons in stones he had 
probably no equal among his contemporaries. These 
sketches impress us with the immense extent of his 
knowledge of ancient history, written, as they were, 
impromptu and without books of reference. His 
fondness for Macaulay's "Lays" also appears at 
many points. For one contemplating a journey in 
his footsteps, these compact little tomes will be found 
a guide of the utmost value, while the student of 
classical history may receive from them many a help- 
ful suggestion, as well as many a lesson in the art of 
compressing a whole chapter of knowledge within 
the limits of a paragraph.

or to the man of science a Life of Werner von 
Siemens needs nothing in the way of justification 
or introduction. To the lay reader it may be said 
that the hook is not the ordinarily tedious life-record 
of a recluse of the laboratory or the lecture-room. 
In Dr. von Siemens, the student and the inventor 
were supplemented by the man of action ; and his 
laurels, therefore, were largely won in grappling 
with practical difficulties. His narrative reads like 
a book of adventure. In his Introduction, Dr. von 
Siemens expresses the hope that his book may prove 
instructive and stimulating to the coming generation, 
in that it shows how " a young man, without inher- 
ited resources and influential supporters, nay, even 
without proper preliminary culture, may, solely 
through his own industry, rise, and do something 
useful in the world." The book is, all in all, one 
of the most notable productions of the past year ; 
and it goes without saying that no one interested in 
the progress of electrical science and of its practical 
application can afford to leave it unread. There is 
a fine frontispiece portrait of the author, whose face 
betokens in every line the true German Thdtigkeit, 
and is certainly not wanting in indications of true 
German Schroffheit a quality which Dr. Siemens 
confessedly admired in others. Mr. W. C. Coup- 
land's translation is generally acceptable ; but it is 
not free from Germanisms. Mechanically, the vol- 
ume is a fine piece of bookmaking.

esting for that, and no Yale man, at least, should 
leave it unread. The different periods and phases 
of President Porter's life are severally treated by 
writers chosen each for his or her special fitness for

his student-life at Yale, Prof. G. P. Fisher of his

of his career as " President of Yale," and so on. 
Two concise expository chapters, " Dr. Porter as a 
Philosopher " and " Dr. Porter's Theory of Morals," 
are furnished by Prof. George M. Duncan and Dr. 
Rikizo Nakashima, respectively ; and there is a co- 
pious " Bibliography" by Mr. J. Sumner Smith. Dr. 
Porter was an estimable character, a man of much 
learning and of little originality, an acute reasoner 
on supplied premises, and the clearest of expositors. 
From the anecdotal portion of the memoir we may 
quote the following sketch of George Eliot, whom 
Dr. Porter met in London in 1853 : " At that time 
she was thirty-five years old, with plain but inter- 
esting features, of a little above medium size, of a 
very quiet and almost timid bearing, most noticeable 
for her singularly refined voice, her clear thoughts, 
her choice yet by no means stilted diction, and above 
all for her fervid yet unaffected sensibility. She 
was free and affable with the family and guests, but 



unmistakably wore the air of a person preocupied 
with many engagements, and living apart in her own 
world of elevated thoughts and intense feeling." 
The volume contains two portraits of Dr. Porter, 
and it ought to have an index. 

Glimpses of In llis " ub - Coelum : A Sky-built 

an insubstantial Human World" (Houghton), Mr. 
A. P. Russell, author of "A Club of 
One," "Library Notes," etc., has strayed (not alto- 
gether prosperously, we think) from his usual lit- 
erary province. Mr. Russell's sketch of an ideal 
society is not a logical development of an a priori 
theory of the State, like the " Republic " of Plato, 
nor is it a compact piece of allegorizing fiction, like 
More's "Utopia." The society he describes strikes 
us. on the whole, as a rather valetudinarian affair, 
adjusted to the requirements of people with shaky 
nerves and east-wind susceptibilities. Sub-Ccelumite 
" nerves and sympathies being too precious to be 
wasted, heads of fowls were lopped off by ingen- 
iously contrived guillotines." At table, " The skilled 
carver, as he cut away the succulent flakes, was ex- 
pected deftly to show them in such light as would 
display their translucency and lustre." "In Sub- 
Cffilum the people did not snore. They had trained 
themselves to avoid the disagreeable act " though 
not, it seems, by the wearing of nocturnal clothes- 
pins. At the "Retreats for Convalescents," among 
other soothing devices for promoting recovery. " In- 
telligent monkeys climbed about in the trees, and 
suspended themselves by their tails." The style of 
the book is sententious to a fault, and there is a too- 
palpable effort at quaintness. We notice, too, occa- 
sional lapses not at all in accord with the usual fin- 
icalness of Sub-Ccelum standards ; for example, we 
learn that at banquets, when the chef appeared, 
"Pledges were drank, and wine poured out in his 
honor." Mr. Russell says some clever things, how- 
ever, and his book is fairly readable ; but we prefer 
him in his " Club Corner." 



The " Essays Speculative and Sug- 
S estive " o John Addington Symonds 
have been reissued in a single hand- 
some volume by his English publishers, and the work 
is imported for sale in this country by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. This is probably the most 
important of the author's several collections of mis- 
cellanea, and one cannot re-read its contents without 
a renewed sense of the loss sustained by English 
letters at the time of his death. In this age of the 
specialist we need such men more than ever before ; 
we need them to preserve the tradition of general 
culture that we are in danger of losing altogether. 
Few men have ever so successfully lived in " the 
whole, the good, and the beautiful " as the English 
historian of the Italian Renaissance, who was at the 
same time the critic of so many phases of art and 
life. The work before us exhibits his critical faculty 
at its best, his trained judgment at its ripest. The 
group of essays on Style contain some of the best 



1894.]

writing upon that subject that has ever been done, 
and the essay on Realism and Idealism comes near 
saying the last word upon that vexed theme. The 
author's eager and sympathetic grasp of the latest 
results of science are well illustrated in this volume, 
as well as his catholic appreciation of the newer 
tendencies of literature. The work is one to keep 
at hand and to ponder over; it is suggestive in the 
sense of being a stimulus even more than a guide ; 
it is a treasure-house of critical comment and prin- 
ciple not easily to be exhausted. 

We have always thought Mr. Henry 

ESSST" James ?. better essa y ist than novelist - 

The critical and analytical habit of 
mind with which he is so richly endowed have proved 
too self-assertive for the purpose of the story-teller. 
But the qualities of expression developed by this 
habit, although out of their proper place when used 
for the purposes of fiction, belong to the essay, and 
bestow upon it substance and value. The u Essays 
in London and Elsewhere," just published (Harper), 
form a volume rich in subtle observations and deli- 
cate critical shadings. The contents are a little ill- 
assorted, for they include sketches of foreign life, 
personal reminiscences, and literary criticism ; but 
each essay by itself (excepting a few too brief to be 
adequate) is a little masterpiece. The paper on 
Fanny Kemble is one of the most lifelike presenta- 
tions of a spiritual personality to be found. The 
essay on Lowell, which combines the personal note 
with the note of objective criticism, is perhaps the 
finest appreciation we have of the finest of our 
latter-day Americans. The group of French writ- 
ers Flaubert, the Goncourt brothers, and " Loti " 
are handled with sure sympathy and real penetra- 
tion. Perhaps the Flaubert essay is the most notable 
of all. Mr. James understands Flaubert's passion 
for style, and helps others to understand how absorb- 
ing and masterful a thing it was. No one has, to 
our thinking, better than Mr. James interpreted for 
English readers the leading aspects of recent French 
literary art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" As We Go " (Harper) is a volume of very brief 
essays by Mr. Charles Dudley Warner. They deal 
mostly with the phases of human intercourse, and em- 
body many a bit of social criticism that strikes deeper 
than would at first appear. For instance, among the 
subjects that the author so lightly touches is that of the 
growing culture of women as contrasted with the indif- 
ference to culture on the part of men. The phenomenon 
has made a distinct impression upon Mr. Warner as 
well it might and he recurs to its discussion more than 
once. For reading that is at once easy and suggestive, 
we commend these genial talks. 

" The Out-Door World " (Longmans) is the name 
given to a handbook for young collectors in natural 
history, the work of Mr. W. Furneaux. The work is 
richly illustrated with sixteen colored plates and over 
five hundred cuts. The colored plates are very well 



done, and upon each of them a number of species are 
crowded. The work is one of the best of the sort that 
we have seen, but the species described are British, and 
hence in most cases the American boy or girl would 
search for them in vain. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. deserve hearty thanks 
for their tasteful library edition of the novels of Alex- 
andre Dumas. For many years, the only American 
editions of the great French novelist were so offensive 
in their appearance that lovers of books could with dif- 
ficulty be persuaded to take them into their hands. A 
translation of " Olympe de Cleves," in two volumes, has 
just been added to the new edition. The publishers claim 
that it is the first publication of this particular romance 
in che English language, but this, we believe, is a mistake. 

The new edition of Mr. William Watson's verses 
(Macmillan) is neatly printed, includes all the hitherto 
published poems (except " The Eloping Angels," which 
no one will miss), and gives a portrait of the author. 
The poems have been rearranged, and are now headed 
by the noble group of elegies that commemorate Words- 
worth, Shelley, Arnold, and Tennyson. " The Prince's 
Quest" makes up a good third of the volume. We 
have praised Mr. Watson's work more than once in 
these pages, and will now merely express a hope that 
no one will be deterred from making his acquaintance 
by the extravagant eulogies which injudicious friends of 
the poet contrived to get printed a few months ago. 

Elizabeth Sheppard's " Rumour," in two volumes, has 
been added to Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.'s reprints of 
that writer's principal novels. Mrs. Harriet Prescott 
Spofford contributes a sympathetic introduction to the 
new edition, which also has frontispiece portraits of 
Beethoven and save the mark ! Louis Napoleon. 
Thackeray's " English Humorists " and Carlyle's " Sar- 
tor Resartus " come to us from the same publishers, in 
a style that commends itself to quiet tastes. 

University extensionists and other teachers will find 
profit in an examination of Dr. Andrew Stephenson's 
" Syllabus of Lectures in European History from the 
Fall of the Western Roman Empire to the Death of 
Napoleon." The book is published by the author, at 
Middletown, Conn. The analysis of the subject is phil- 
osophical, and the divisions are well supplied with re- 
ferences. Indeed, the individual student, seeking to 
work up European history without the aid of an in- 
structor, could not easily find a better outline guide 
than this little work. 

Dr. W. D. Halliburtou's "The Essentials of Chem- 
ical Physiology " (Longmans) is a text-book for the use 
of students, and is upon the plan of Professor Schaefer's 
" Essentials of Histology." The work includes an ele- 
mentary and an advanced course, and its pages bear the 
class-room stamp. Each lesson is provided with labora- 
tory exercises and demonstrations, and the work has 
many wood-cut illustrations. 

The title-page of a recent work published by Messrs. 
Joel Munsell's Sons is so comprehensively descriptive 
of the book itself that we reprint it without comment. 
"Journal of Colonel George Washington, commanding 
a detachment of Virginia troops, sent by Robert Din- 
widdie, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, across the 
Allegheny Mountains in 1754, to build forts at the head 
of the Ohio. It comprises the history of marches, 
campings, and events, a skirmish with the French, and 
the death of their leader, de Junonville. The Journal 
fell into the hands of the enemy, who, in 1756, printed

a version of it in French; a new translation of this into 
English is here given in the absence of the original. 
To complete the history of the Expedition an appendix 
is added in the form of a diary, supplying an account of 
the battle of the Great Meadows and the capitulation 
of Fort Necessity; the retreat of the army; with copies 
of original muster and pay-rolls of the Virginia regi- 
ment, and other documents connected with this Expe- 
dition." This important document is edited, with co- 
pious annotations, by Dr. J. M. Toner. 

Mr. Samuel Adams Drake, in " The Making of Vir- 
ginia and the Middle Colonies, 1578-1701 " (Scribner), 
has constructed a volume intermediate between the 
school text-book and the history for the general reader. 
He has sought to fill out the bare outlines of the narra- 
tive so " as to give the pupil something more than the 
dry bones " and so to condense the tale " as to put its 
essence without loss of vitality, in a few words," in 
which aims, seemingly so antagonistic, he seems to have 
been measurably successful. The book has many wood- 
cuts. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, December 25, 1893. 

The annual dinner of the New England Society of 
this city has just taken place, with even more than the 
usual success from a popular point of view. The care- 
fully prepared speeches were given a page or more in 
several of the newspapers, the proceedings were re- 
ported in full, 'and portraits of the speakers have been 
displayed for our satisfaction, although perhaps to the 
chagrin of their alleged originals. These New England 
dinners are admirable things in their way. They also 
are interesting as showing how absolute perfection can 
be attained in the management of the reportorial side 
of an entertainment. In marked contrast with this af- 
fair was the complimentary dinner tendered to Brander 
Matthews some two nights before by fifty of his asso- 
ciates in the world of letters and art, of which no re- 
port whatever has appeared in the daily newspapers. 
Yet I do not think any event of equal and similar im- 
portance has taken place here this season. Doubtless 
a large constituency of the press would have been in- 
terested in an account of the proceedings, but those 
concerned in the management of the dinner seem to 
have been indifferent about getting it reported, and so, 
quite characteristically of this great city, it was not re- 
ported. 

Ever since Mr. Matthews accepted a professorship 
in literature at Columbia College there has been a feel- 
ing among those familiar with his private as well as his 
public services to the cause of letters that some special 
recognition of these services should be made. This feel- 
ing culminated in a plan for the dinner just given. A 
committee was formed, composed of friends of Mr. 
Matthews connected with each of his varied interests. 
For literature, Mr. Warner, Mr. Howells, Mr. Clemens, 
Mr. Hutton, Mr. Bunner, Mr. Gilder, and Mr. Bur- 
lingame, of the authors and editors, and Mr. J. Henry 
Harper and Mr. Charles Scribner, of the publishers, were 
called in. President Low of Columbia, Prof. Barrett 
Wendell of Harvard, Prof. Lounsbury of Yale, and Prof. 
Sloane of Princeton, stood for education. Mr. Joseph Jef- 
ferson, Mr. Francis Wilson, Mr. A. M. Palmer, and Mr. 
Daniel Frohman represented the stage. Mr. F. D. Mil- 
let, Mr. J. Carroll Beckwith, and Mr. Stanford White 



represented art; while Mr. Theodore Roosevelt and Mr. 
Henry Cabot Lodge appeared on the list as exponents 
of that Americanism for which Mr. Matthews himself 
is so justly celebrated. These gentlemen and many 
others gathered around an immense table at Sherry's, 
and made and listened to warm and well-deserved tri- 
butes to the character and achievements of their friend. 
Mr. Warner presided and gave the opening address, to 
which Mr. Matthews responded in a brief but very 
graceful, modest, and witty speech. Then followed 
speeches in order from Messrs. E. C. Stedman, How- 
ells, Low, Clemens, Gilder, Sloane, Frohman, and Bram 
Stoker. Mr. Bunner read a poem written for the oc- 
casion. The speakers appeared at their best, and ap- 
plause and laughter were constant. A souvenir of the 
occasion has been signed by all present, worded as fol- 
lows: "To Brander Matthews, by a few of the friends 
he has made, a few of the friends he has helped, and a 
few of the friends he has helped to make." 

Another event of considerable interest to the writing 
guild is the publication of the much talked of " Liber 
Scriptorum " or "Book of the Author's Club." The 
Author's Club celebrated its decennial last winter, and 
is in a most flourishing condition, but up to date it has 
been obliged to hire rooms for its meetings. To obtain 
a nucleus for a building fund, Mr. Rossiter Johnson 
suggested that the members of the club jointly write a 
book, sign their articles in each copy printed, and dis- 
pose of the edition at a fair profit above cost. After 
many experiences, some amusing and some quite pro- 
voking, the book is at last completed. There are two 
hundred and fifty-one copies printed, one of which re- 
mains the property of the club. The others are to be 
sold. In fact, most of them are already subscribed for. 
One hundred and nine members of the club have con- 
tributed poems or articles to the " Liber Scriptorum," and 
each contributor has signed his name at the end of his 
article in every copy of the boon. The articles will not 
be printed elsewhere, and no further editions of the vol- 
ume will be published. All the original manuscripts 
have been preserved, and as they are written on differ- 
ent sizes of paper, they are now being inlaid in uniform 
sheets, and will be bound up in volumes. They will 
then be sold to the highest bidder. The book itself is 
extremely interesting. The authors have not considered 
the necessities of any publication or market in writing 
their contributions. One readily sees,~in turning over 
the broad leaves, that for once they have written to 
please themselves. Hence all sorts of hobbies crop out, 
and especially is your funny man inclined to grow pa- 
thetic and your serious fellow to indulge in light humor. 
Novelists become poets, and vice versa. The printing 
has been done by Mr. De Vinne, himself a member of 
the club, on handmade paper bearing the club's name 
as a water-mark. The binding has been specially de- 
vised for the book; and head and tail pieces, vignettes, 
etc., have been drawn by Mr. Louis J. Rhead. Alto- 
gether " Liber Scriptorum " is unique. 

The past week has also been notable for the publica- 
tion of the first volume of Messrs. Funk & WagnalFs 
" Standard Dictionary of the English Language." Orig- 
inally intended to be in one volume, the development 
of the work has made two necessary. It is now hoped 
to complete this undertaking by May of next year. A 
visit to the working-rooms of the dictionary, where a 
small army of editors and assistants are daily occupied, 
is quite interesting. All the processes of making a dic- 
tionary, from the first preparation of " copy," through 



1894.] 



ten or twelve proofs, may be observed seriatim. First 
and last, several hundred editors, specialists, and read- 
ers have been engaged upon the dictionary, which will 
contain, I am told, about seventy thousand more words 
than any work of the kind yet completed. Dr. Funk 
is editor-in-chief, Prof. Francis A. March consulting 
editor, Dr. D. S. Gregory managing editor, and Messrs. 
Bostwick, Champlin, and Rossiter Johnson associate ed- 
itors a staff which ensures faithful and accurate work. 
President William R. Harper of Chicago supervises the 
department of " Biblical Terms." 

The third edition of Mr. Winter's " Life and Art 
of Edwin Booth " is now being printed by Messrs. Mac- 
millan & Co. A still more interesting announcement is 
that Mr. Winter has commenced work on a " Life " of 
Joseph Jefferson, to be published by the same firm. A 
more congenial subject for author and public could not 
well be devised. Messrs. Macmillan & Co. also an- 
nounce " The Dawn of Astronomy : A Study of the As- 
tronomy and Temple Worship of the Ancient Egypt- 
ians," by J. Norman Lockwood, F.R.S. Mr. Lockwood, 
it will be remembered, is editor of "Nature." This 
most fascinating subject has been treated in a thorough 
yet simple way, and an examination of the sheets leads 
me to believe that the book will rival Prof. Charles A. 
Young's " The Sun " in popularity. It is likely to prove 
the most interesting contribution to astronomical science 
in several years. 

The author of " The Captain of the Janizaries," Dr. 
James M. Ludlow, is pastor of a church at Orange, N. J., 
but is often seen in New York, where he belongs to some 
of the literary clubs. The recent charges of plagiarism 
made against the writer of a similar and more recently 
published historical romance have not been countenanced 
by Dr. Ludlow, as I have reason to know, nor has he 
sought to " advertise " his book in this way. " The Cap- 
tain of the Janizaries, a Story of the Times of Scander- 
beg and the Fall of Constantinople," was published in 
1886, and was an immediate success. The thousands 
who read and enjoyed this brilliant romance at that time, 
or who have read it since, will be loth to believe that 
any such advertising is in the slightest degree necessary. 
Dr. Ludlow covered the field in his own fashion, and 



covered ic well. 



ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



JjITERARY NOTES AND MlSCEJ^LANY. 

The new editor of " The Quarterly Review " is Mr. 
R. E. Prothero. 

Mr. Swinburne is about to publish "Astrophel and 
Other Poems," a volume of lyrics. 

Mr. R. W. Gilder recently lectured in Brooklyn upon 
" Abraham Lincoln and his Literary Development." 

A society has just been formed in Paris, with M. 
Gaston Boissier as president, for the study of French 
literary history. 

The Rev. Arthur Kinglake, brother of the historian, 
and author of a life of General Gordon, has just died, 
in his eightieth year. 

University Extension has reached the Continent by 
way of Belgium, and encouraging reports are received 
from Brussels and Ghent. 

" The Electrical Engineer " will soon issue " The In- 
ventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikolas Tesla," 
a work prepared by Mr. T. C. Martin. 

Herr Bjornson's " En Hanske " (A Glove) is to be 



produced in London, with the cooperation of the author. 
Are we on the eve of the long delayed Bjornson "boom"? 
Signora Duse has just appeared in Berlin as Magda, 
the heroine of Herr Sudermann's "Heimath," which 
Madame Modjeska has recently put upon the American 
stage. 

A collection of letters written by Edward FitzGerald 
to Fanny Kemble has recently come into the possession 
of Mr. Bentley, the London publisher. We hope they 
may soon see the light. 

An International Congress of Journalists is expected 
to be held next year at Antwerp, where a meeting has 
just been had in reference to the matter, and a com- 
mittee to carry out the project has been named. 

The third session of the Plymouth School of Applied 
Ethics is announced for July and August of this year. 
There will be the usual courses of lectures in the three 
departments of ethics, economics, and the history of re- 
ligions. 

Professor Max Miiller has received from the King of 
Siam an offer of sufficient funds to guarantee the con- 
tinuance of "The Sacred Books of the East." The 
money will be used, in the first place, for printing a 
translation of the remaining portions of the Buddhist 
Tripitaka. 

We make the following clipping from an exchange: 
" It is reported that a leading Bostonian and a lover of 
solid literature has only with difficulty been prevailed 
upon to omit from his will a clause prohibiting his first 
heir from inheriting the bulk of his property if the said 
heir ' habitually reads newspapers.' " 

The new edition of the Correspondence of Edward 
FitzGerald, which Mr. W. Aldis Wright has in hand, 
will, it is said, contain something like fifty new letters; 
and Mr. Edward Clodd has also been entrusted with 
some hitherto unpublished letters of FitzGerald for a 
magazine article. 

An English publisher will soon begin a new and com- 
plete translation of Tourgue'nieff. There will be about 
ten or twelve volumes, including his novels and tales, 
" The Memoirs of a Sportsman," " Senilia," etc. The 
translations are to be entirely new, and due to Mrs. 
Edward Garnett. Introductions and notes are to be 
supplied. 

According to the Paris " Figaro " M. Daudet considers 
" Numa Roumestan " his best novel. Other authors who 
have expressed a preference for their works are M. Cher- 
buliez for " Meta Holdenis," M. Hale'vy for " La Fam- 
ille "Cardinal," and M. Loti for " De la Pitie' et de la 
Mort." M. Zola says he has no preference except for 
certain pages in each of his books. " After I have com- 
pleted a book," he says, " it no longer exists for me. 
My books are like the graves of relatives and friends 
once very dear to me." 

In bequeathing to Balliol the copyright of his writ- 
ings, the late Professor Jowett said: "I desire that 
they may be republished from time to time as may seem 
expedient, and that the profits, if any, arising from the 
republication of them shall be invested from time to 
time, and the income thence accruing applied, in the 
first place, to the improvement or correction 6f them; 
secondly, to the making of new translations or editions 
of great authors, or in any way assisting or advancing 
the study of Greek literature, and otherwise for the ad- 
vancement of learning." 

At Oxford, about a month ago, Congregation, by a 
large majority, passed a resolution declaring the estab-

[Jan. 1, 



lisbment of a final honor examination in English litera- 
ture and language. As to the main lines on which the 
new examination should be framed there seems to be a 
fairly general agreement. It may be safely predicted 
that care will be taken to award equal weight to litera- 
ture and language that a general knowledge of both 
will be required of all candidates, but that within these 
limits those who read for the school will be left free to 
devote themselves specially to one or the other of these 
two subjects. 

Professor Goldwin Smith, in issuing the fourth edi- 
tion of his work on the United States, adds a new pref- 
ace from which we take the following: " The writer 
cannot send this fourth edition of his work to press 
without specially acknowledging the kindness of his 
American readers and reviewers, whose reception of a 
book which in some things contravenes cherished tra- 
ditions is a proof of American candor and liberality. 
Perhaps they have discerned, beneath the British critic 
of American history, the Anglo-Saxon who, to the Re- 
public which he regards as the grandest achievement of 
his race, desires to offer no homage less pure or noble 
than the truth." 

Seven books of the " Anabasis " are included in the 
edition, just published, by President W. R. Harper and 
Dr. James Wallace (American Book Co.). The work 
is done upon the familiar " inductive " plan of its pre- 
decessors in this series of classical text-books, and the 
presentation is very attractive, mechanically and other- 
wise. The same publishers send us a new edition of 
Dr. Arnold's "Latin Prose Compositions," revised by 
Mr. J. E. Mulholland. From Messrs. Ginn & Co. we 
have " Livy," Books XXI. and XXII., edited by Profes- 
sors J. B. Greenough and Tracy Peck ; and " The Be- 
ginner's Greek Composition," by Messrs. W. C. Collar 
and W. G. Daniell. 

" Poet-Lore," upon the occasion of its fifth anniver- 
sary, which comes with the beginning of the year, sends 
us a " new-year's greeting " which gives a sketch of its 
career, its aims, and its successes. It makes some 
interesting promises for the coming year, including 
unpublished letters of George Eliot, translations from 
Maeterlinck and Strindberg, and a " School of Litera- 
ture " for the help of clubs and classes. The magazine 
is a little too obtrusive in its Browningism, and informs 
us that the special attention " always accorded to Shake- 
speare and Browning is a habit in which it will persist"; 
T>nt this one little fad may be forgiven a periodical that 
stands so steadfastly, and on the whole so sensibly, for 
good literature, and for the value of poetry in all the 
walks of life. 

Messrs. Copeland & Day, in announcing their limited 
edition of Rossetti's " House of Life," send us the fol- 
lowing explanatory note: "The one hundred and three 
sonnets and eleven lyrics with which Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti chose to build his House of Life, are here set 
forth according to their obvious design. Those used in 
the volume of MDCCCLXX. are reproduced as they 
then appeared, not as they have appeared since in the 
volume of MDCCCLXXXI. The deplorable circum- 
stance is well known which led to the too sensitive with- 
drawal of one of the sequence and to the revision of 
others: a mistaken sacrifice of beauty to a mistakenly 
imposed ideal. The makers of this edition revert by 
choice to the poet's original plan of work. As The 
House of Life stood in Rossetti's mind, so it stands, once 
again, in its innocence and perfection." 

We quote from " The Athenaeum " the following par- 



ticulars of two recent literary " finds " in Germany : 
" The important ' Luther find ' made some time ago in 
the Rathsschulbibliothek at Zwickau moved the author- 
ities of the town to commission the discoverer of the 
Lutherana to explore and arrange the manuscript treas- 
ures of their library. No fewer than 3,000 letters of 
the Reformation period have been discovered. They 
are now catalogued and described, and can be consulted 
by historical students. The richness of the collection 
may be imagined from the fact that the letters are by 
391 writers: 224 are from printers, 295 from ecclesias- 
tics and theologians, 349 from scholars, and 192 deal 
with mining. Nearly the whole of these letters were 
addressed to Stephan Roch, the town clerk of Zwickau, 
who died in 1546. The manuscript containing a large 
number of Meistergedichte, which was discovered in the 
Town Library of Nuremberg, proves to be a genuine 
production of Hans Sachs. The volume comprises four- 
teen hitherto unknown Meistergesdnge of the famous 
Meistersinger. 

BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AS BRIC-A-BRAC. 
A propos to the familiar question, What do "society" 
people read ? the New York " Evening Post " presents 
some amusing information derived from a recent discus- 
sion of the subject in the " Home and Society" columns 
of a paper which circulates largely among the refined 
and educated classes of the Eastern metropolis. " From 
what was said there of the views and practices of those 
classes, it would appear that literature is mainly a thing 
to be ' arranged.' ' The arrangement of current litera- 
ture is indicative of the culture and social position of a 
modern household,' and very naturally, therefore, ' a 
fashionable woman, who is in touch with the world,' can- 
not be too careful in training her < parlor-maid or foot- 
man to arrange the small tables containing periodicals 
and magazines and the talked-of books of the hour.' 
We cannot go into all the nice points relating to the ex- 
act minute of the day when the morning papers are to 
be replaced, in ' their own special resting place,' by the 
evening journals, and the way in which the ' bits of light 
literature which are more or less discussed ' are to be 
placed ' one overlapping the other, leaving the titles free 
to be read.' It should be noted, however, that ' it looks 
well to have the Revue des Deux Mondes and some clever 
German publication [we suggest the Archiv fiir Eisen- 
bahnweseri] added to the collection.' There was nowhere 
any suggestion that anything was ever to be actually- 
read, the chief end of books and magazines being to 
take their place becomingly among other bric-k-brac. 
We did not need to be assured that <even children 
brought vip in such an atmosphere ' are different from 
those who have never had the advantage of a correct 
arrangement of literature. That we coiild have believed 
on a-priori grounds." 

PROCEEDINGS OF THE AUXILIARY CONGRESSES. 
The proceedings of sevei-al of last summer's Congresses 
are finding their way into print, pending the decision of 
the United States Government to provide for their com- 
plete publication. The work of the Religious Congress 
is now appearing and promises to be a commercially 
successful venture. The proceedings of the Congress 
of Representative Women are announced for early pub- 
lication in two large volumes. The Educational and 
Philological proceedings will appear under the auspices 
of the societies having them in charge. Meanwhile the 
officers of the World's Congress Auxiliary have circu- 
lated an appeal for the aid of the Government, giving a

THE DIAL

number of good reasons why the work should be under- 
taken at public expense. The last and most cogent of 
these reasons is thus stated : " The true international 
character of these Congresses, and the direct and active 
participation of the Government of the United States in 
convening them, has given them a character far above 
and beyond any private or local enterprise. The ex- 
pectation that the proceedings would be printed and 
distributed by this Government to the other nations 
which have participated in the Columbian Exposition 
was expressed in some of the earlier publications rela- 
tive to this work sent to foreign countries by the De- 
partment of State. It is therefore deemed eminently 
proper to ask the Congress of the United States to pro- 
vide for the printing of the proceedings of the several 
Congresses as public documents, to be sent to the libraries 
of the different States and Nations, and their leading 
colleges, universities and other public institutions, where 
they would be accessible to students of human progress 
in all its various departments, and would be reproduced 
in a multitude of forms for the information of the peo- 
ple of our own and other lands." 

A SUMMARY OF TYNDALI/S CHARACTER. 

" The Saturday Review " thus sums up the character 
of Professor Tyndall: 

" A headlong temperament, however, is by no means 
always, or perhaps often, a temperament that can be 
called disagreeable ; and Dr. Tyndall was both liked and 
loved by a very large circle of friends. His close asso- 
ciation for many years with Carlyle was not likely to have 
the result of moderating his language, and in his fam- 
ous controversy with the Commissioners of Irish Lights 
a softer and wilier tongue would have made more cer- 
tain of the victory. He has been blamed because he 
erected a screen on his property at Hindhead. But if 
which is quite conceivable he found the screen not 
so ugly as the people and the sights it shut out, who 
shall blame him ? And for the last seven years he had 
been in the habit of saying things about Mr. Gladstone 
which caused Mr. Gladstone's followers to exhibit the 
convulsions of fish just extracted from the water. Per- 
haps some of these things were not said with perfect 
wisdom; but, as has been observed, it was impossible 
for Dr. Tyndall to be mealy-mouthed. And when, as 
an Irishman, as a scientific observer accustomed to con- 
nect cause and effect, and as one who felt in common 
with the vast majority of men of brains and education, 
he saw a statesman endeavoring to damage, if not to 
ruin, his country he said so. 

" Thus in many ways Dr. Tyndall was one of the 
most characteristic figures of his time, even if he some- 
times represented its foible as well as its forte. A man 
of wide knowledge and wide interest, a hard player as 
well as a hard worker, poles asunder from the popular 
conception of a savant as a recluse who only leaves his 
study to take a walk in the goloshes on the pavement, 
he took, at least as long as health was granted, most 
things ' with a frolic welcome,' and those which he could 
not welcome in a hearty posture of fight. Others in dif- 
ferent classes, or even in his own class, may have had 
deeper or subtler intellectual insight, a purer style, a 
greater knowledge of literature and other non-scientific 
things. But few had a healthier, a more vigorous, or a 
kindlier spirit, and very few indeed had such a gift of 
easily understanded exposition in a day when all things 
are supposed to be capable of being expounded to the 
people."

THE REPOET ON SECONDARY 
EDUCATION. 

To at least one class of thoughtful persons 
the advent of the new year brings much encour- 
agement. The publication, by the United States 
Bureau of Education, of the Report of the Com- 
mittee on Secondary School Studies, appointed 
by the National Educational Association at the 



annual meeting held in the summer of 1892, 
is an event of capital importance to educators, 
and brings with it the promise of many long- 
needed reforms. The Committee in question, 
consisting of ten members, with President Eliot 
as chairman, undertook to consider the entire 
subject of secondary education, for the pur- 
pose of pointing out the defects in our existing 
systems of instruction, and of indicating the 
needed reforms. The Committee, in pursu- 
ance of this aim, determined to organize Con- 
ferences, of ten members each, upon the follow- 
ing subjects : 1, Latin ; 2, Greek ; 3, English ; 
4, Other Modern Languages ; 5, Mathematics ; 
6, Physics, Astronomy, and Chemistry ; 7, 
Natural History (Biology, including Botany, 
Zoology, and Physiology); 8, History, Ci\jil 
Government, and Political Economy ; 9, Geog- 
raphy (Physical Geography, Geology, and Me- 
teorology). Having made a selection of ninety 
experienced educators for these Conferences, 
the Committee prepared for their consideration 
a list of questions and topics for discussion, 
covering all the vital points of both theory and 
practice. Their work thus outlined, the Con- 
ferences met, a little over a year ago, and held 
sessions of three days each. From these ses- 
sions reports were drawn up and submitted to 
the Committee of Ten. This Committee then 
met, digested and summarized the nine reports, 
and prepared its own report from the materials 
thus furnished. The publication now before 
us includes the Report of the Committee and 
the nine reports of the Conferences. It rep- 
resents the best judgment of a hundred picked 
educators upon a great variety of subjects, and 
thus bears an authority beyond that which has 
ever before attached to an educational docu- 
ment published in this country and dealing 
with our own educational problems. 

By far the most striking feature of these re- 
ports is the unanimity with which their main 
conclusions were reached. Two of the Con- 
ferences presented minority reports, and one 
member of the Committee felt constrained to 
do likewise ; but these dissentient opinions re- 
late to a few points only, and leave the general 
agreement but little impaired. When we con- 
sider the great differences in practice that ob- 
tain in different sections of the country, it was 



36 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



to be expected that the opinions expressed in 
the Conferences would exhibit many an irree- 
oncileable divergence. Instead of this (to quote 
from the document) " the nine reports are 
characterized by an amount of agreement which 
quite surpasses the most sanguine anticipa- 
tions." One important and far-reaching illus- 
tration of this agreement may be given. It is 
a view commonly held by persons of consider- 
able intelligence that fitting for college is one 
thing, and general education quite another. 
Consequently, a large proportion of high-school 
programmes provide distinct courses for these 
two objects, courses distinct not only in sub- 
ject-matter (which they probably should be) 
but in the methods of instruction employed. 
To get an expression of opinion upon this point, 
the Committee put the following question to 
the Conferences : " Should the subject be 
treated differently for pupils who are going to 
college, for those who are going to a scientific 
school, and for those who, presumably, are go- 
ing to neither ? " The answer came in no un- 
certain accents, being an absolutely unanimous 
negative. In other words, " ninety-eight teach- 
ers, intimately concerned either with the actual 
work of American secondary schools, or with 
the results of that work as they appear in stu- 
dents who come to college, unanimously declare 
that every subject which is taught at all in a 
secondary school should be taught in the same 
way and to the same extent to every pupil so 
long as he pursues it, no matter what the prob- 
able destination of the pupil may be, or at what 
point his education is to cease." The signifi- 
cance of this statement needs no explanation. 
It should once for all upset a superstition that 
has operated, and still operates, to complicate 
school programmes, and to provide one set of 
students with a training inferior to that re- 
ceived by others, in the mistaken hope of being 
helpful to them. Of course, this decision is 
only another way of saying that education is 
the business of the educator ; but even so ob- 
vious a truth as that, while admitted in the ab- 
stract, is often denied in the concrete by the 
well-meaning but misguided persons who prate 
about what they call " practical " education. 

The moderation of the demands made by the 
Conferences is another noteworthy feature of 
this report. Educators are apt to attach so 
much importance to their several specialties as 
to make for them claims impossible to meet in 
the aggregate. It was feared by many that so 
much would be asked as to make reform seem 
impracticable. But, so far from this being the 



case, it is found, upon tabulation of the results, 
that to concede all the demands of all the Con- 
ferences would burden the high-school course 
with but fifty per cent more work than it can 
be expected to undertake. This being the case, 
it is obviously easy to compress the revised 
course within working limits by slightly reduc- 
ing the demands of the Conferences, and by 
allowing the elective principle to have some 
play. How easily this may be done, without 
seriously impairing the value of the recom- 
mendations, is clearly shown by the specimen 
courses formulated in the Report of the Com- 
mittee. But to accomplish the much-needed 
reforms, one thing is absolutely essential. 
Much of the work now done in the high schools 
must be put into the elementary years, and 
place must be made for it by a more rational 
treatment of the elementary subjects. Unless 
school boards and superintendents are prepared 
to do this, they might as well attempt to do 
nothing. The glaring fact in our elementary 
education is that the American child, as com- 
pared with the French or German child, loses 
two years somewhere between the ages of six 
and fourteen. These two years are mainly 
wasted upon arithmetic and formal grammar ; 
and our report indicates very accurately the 
points at which the knife must be applied. By 
suitable excisions, joined with scientific meth- 
ods of instruction, those two years may be 
saved to the child. The Report also shows 
very distinctly what should be done with them. 
Work in elementary science, the beginnings of 
algebra and geometry, ancient history, and the 
introduction of Latin or a modern language at 
the age of twelve, are the suggestions made ; 
and without the courage to adopt them there 
is little hope of accomplishing much in the way 
of reform. 

We have admitted that the elective princi- 
ple may possibly be allowed some play in the 
high school. But we believe that it should be 
accepted with great caution, and closely guarded 
against abuse. In this respect we think that 
the tendency of the Report is to countenance 
a dangerous latitude. It is suggested, for ex- 
ample, that the colleges might accept as a qual- 
ification for admission a stated amount of work 
done in a specified number of subjects, with lit- 
tle or no regard to the selection of those sub- 
jects. Thus, " every youth who entered college 
would have spent four years in studying a few 
subjects thoroughly ; and, on the theory that 
all the subjects are to be considered equivalent 
in educational rank for the purposes of admis- 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



37 



sion to college, it would make no difference 
which subjects he had chosen from the pro- 
gramme he would have had four years of 
strong and effective mental training." We are 
glad that one member of the Committee dis- 
sented so strongly from this arid similar pas- 
sages that he felt bound to make a minority 
report. " All such statements," says this dis- 
senter, " are based upon the theory that, for 
the purposes of general education, one study 
is as good as another, a theory which appears 
to me to ignore philosophy, psychology, and the 
science of education. It is a theory which 
makes education formal, and does not consider 
the nature and value of the content." Some 
studies, such as the ancient or modern lan- 
guages, the English language and literature, 
mathematics, and physical science, must be 
treated as absolutely essential, and the courses 
must be so framed that no student, by any sort 
of election or substitution, can escape them. 
In this matter the position of the minority re- 
port seems to us impregnable. 

The document now under discusssion is so 
carefully considered and so rich in suggestions 
that many pages of THE DIAL would be re- 
quired to do it justice. We can, at present, 
only note in the briefest way a few of its special 
features. At every possible point it places em- 
phasis upon the fact that without competent 
teachers the best of systems is valueless. There 
is no doubt that the schools of this country need 
good teachers much more than they need good 
courses or anything else. That the studies in- 
cluded in a course should work together, and 
that each subject should contribute to the others, 
are points frequently urged in this Report, and 
cannot be urged too often. History and liter- 
ature and natural science should go hand in 
hand, and all should give training in the use of 
the English language. Especially should this 
latter aim be furthered by all foreign language 
work. Good English, spoken and written, 
should be demanded upon all occasions. As 
for translation into English, the following, from 
the report of the Latin Conference, is the law 
and the prophets : " The student should be 
taught to regard translation, not as a means of 
finding out what his author has said, but as, on 
the one hand, a way of making it clear to his 
instructor that he has understood, and, on the 
other, an exercise in expression, a literary 
exercise, in his own tongue." In modern no 
less than in classical language work, the ability 
to read is, of course, the main object ; and this 
is emphatically proclaimed by the Conference 



upon that subject. Much stress is laid upon 
the necessity of laboratory work in all science 
instruction, but no countenance is given to the 
notion that pupils in the laboratory are "en- 
gaged in rediscovering the laws of Nature." 
It is pregnantly suggested that not science 
alone, but history and other subjects, need ap- 
paratus and the introduction of methods akin 
to those used in the laboratory. No provision 
is made for drawing as a separate study ; but 
this is with the understanding that drawing is, 
like writing, to be early begun, and used freely 
in all the stages of education. The suggestion 
that the study of civil government should be 
comparative is wise, as is also the suggestion 
that physiology should be studied at a very late 
period in the course. It is also far better to 
devote a full year (as recommended) to either 
botany or zoology (the former being preferable) 
than to give a half-year to each, as is so fre- 
quently done. We might go on indefinitely 
approving of the specific recommendations of 
the Report, but enough has been said to show 
how comprehensive and practical a document it 
is, and how thoroughly it stands for the accepted 
principles of scientific pedagogics. 

On the other hand, we are compelled to single 
out two or three features of the Report for ad- 
verse criticism. The English Conference, for 
example, almost ignores the historical study of 
English literature. While it is true enough 
that " the mechanical use of ' manuals of liter- 
ature ' should be avoided, and the committing 
to memory of names and dates should not be 
mistaken for culture," it is also true, in our 
opinion, that the following suggestion does not 
offer an adequate treatment of the subject : " In 
the fourth year, however, an attempt may be 
made, by means of lectures or otherwise, to give 
the pupil a view of our literature as a whole, 
and to acquaint him with the relations between 
periods." We cannot concur with the recom- 
mendation of the Conference on history to omit 
economics from the high-school course. The 
incidental instruction in economic topics pro- 
posed as a substitute will not do. No science 
whose scope and subject-matter are as strictly 
defined as are those of economics can possibly 
be imparted by such haphazard and desultory 
instruction. And there is absolutely nothing 
more important for the graduate of an Ameri- 
can high school to know than the elements of 
a science of which the practical problems will 
confront him at every period of his life, and of 
which ignorance will cost him dear both as a 
man and a citizen. The Conference on physics,

chemistry, and astronomy includes in its report 
one resolution which we believe to be indefens- 
ible. Chemistry is made to precede physics, 
although it is admitted that this order " is 
plainly not the logical one." The only reason 
given for the resolution is that physics should 
have the benefit of as much mathematics as 
possible, and for this reason should come late 
in the course. Fortunately, we have in this 
case a minority report which might have been 
made more forcible than it is, and which will 
convince most readers that the position of the 
majority is untenable. Fortunately, also, the 
Committee has, in the construction of its tenta- 
tive programmes, ignored this unhappy recom- 
mendation, and restored physics to its proper 
place as a necessary preparation for the study 
of chemistry. 

On the whole, much good may be expected 
to result from the work of the Conferences. 
The Report is printed as a Government docu- 
ment, and, as such, will be freely circulated. 
It should get into the hands of every serious 
teacher in the country. Its recommendations 
will, if generally carried out, result in a system 
combining uniformity and elasticity in happy 
proportions. They make for good teaching in 
the essentials, and they do not make for rigidity. 
It is probably fortunate that local initiative in 
educational matters counts with us for so much 
as it does. Centralization has its advantages, 
but it has also its evils. When it operates to 
reduce a system to a condition of mechanical 
uniformity, regulating the activity of its teach- 
ers in the minutest detail, prescribing for them 
methods and imposing upon them text-books, 
it becomes a curse rather than a blessing, for 
it suppresses the individuality of the teacher, 
and thus strikes at the root of all vital effort 
towards the inculcation of knowledge. The 
Report of the Committee of Ten has no such ob- 
ject in view. It seeks to stimulate rather than 
to repress endeavor ; it is meant to be followed 
in the spirit rather than in the letter. It can- 
not well fail to exert a far-reaching and an 
enduring influence upon American education. 



THE "STAR" SYSTEM IN 
PERIODICALS. 

Even an unobservant reader must have noticed a 
change which in the last few years has come over 
the spirit of that form of periodical generally known 
as the Review. Two successive steps have helped 
to transform the dignified, impersonal review of 
thirty years ago into the decidedly personal, wide- 



awake, not to say flippant, magazine of to-day. The 
first innovation substituted signed for unsigned 
articles. The second introduced the system of so- 
licited contributions, or what might be called the 
aggregation of great names on the title-page. The 
editor, nowadays, scans with a journalistic eye the 
horizon of passing events, and, sending direct to the 
chief hero in each day's drama, requests him to tell 
the world what he has done, through the medium of 
his review, whose check he begs to enclose. Thirty 
years ago, we read an anonymous review by John 
Smith on General Jones's famous march to the .sea. 
Ten years ago, we read John Smith's signed article 
on the same subject. To-day we read General 
Jones's article, " How I Marched to the Sea." 

As the new departure seems to be a financial suc- 
cess, nothing more need be said to justify it from 
the publisher's point of view. It cannot be denied 
that the interest of the majority of people to-day is 
centred in the newspaper : their talk is about men of 
newspaper fame partisan leaders, popular preach- 
ers, socialists, reformers, or society stars. It only 
required a shrewd business man to see that that mag- 
azine would be most popular which should treat only 
of those topics that fill the papers, in articles writ- 
ten by the very men of whom the papers are talking. 
By making itself over, as it were, into a bright, 
crisp, superior sort of monthly newspaper, the re- 
view assures itself of a reading public. 

Nor is the benefit all on the publisher's side. It 
is most plausibly asserted, that what this bustling 
world of readers wants is, not a long, exhaustive, 
and exhausting essay, by an outsider, but a short, 
clear, telling summary of events to date, by the 
man who knows most about them. As the review 
editor skilfully puts it, Which is better reading, 
the description of a political contest written by a 
bystander, or a vivid account of the encounter from 
the participants inside the ring? a correspondent's 
description of a battle, or the commanding gen- 
eral's? In short, is it better to get your informa- 
tion second-hand, or straight from the the fountain- 
head? 

Yet this argument is specious. By degrees the 
reader becomes conscious of certain drawbacks 
among the many advantages of the new system. 
Its two marked features are that the articles are 
solicited, and that many of the authors are not 
writers. Each of these brings about results not 
altogether pleasing. 

In the first place, if contributions are solicited, 
they have to be published. Under the old regime,. 
an editor's chief duty was rejection ; and rejections 
he sometimes made with a high and mighty hand. 
But if one, by immense exertion, secures the pro- 
mise of an article from the Sultan of Turkey on 
" What I know about Harems," and announces its 
publication in the blackest of headlines, one can 
scarcely refuse to print it when received, or ask its 
august author to revise. An adroit editor would 
probably find for himself some loop-hole of escape, 
did the noble author know more about harems than, 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

could well appear on the pages of an American mag- 
azine. But we may be sure that the article would 
never be rejected, or amended, simply because its 
author chose to know nothing about harems, or knew 
only what was trite and tiresome. 

It may often happen, too. that an article is asked 
for at a time when a great man has other things to 
do, and that accordingly we do not get his best, 
however flattered he may be at being recognized 
as the spokesman of his party. We may be sure 
that the author of a new Tariff Bill cares more for 
its passage than he does to explain it in six maga- 
zine pages. Else why should some of these much 
advertised articles be as tasteless and formal as a 
school-boy's essay ? unless, indeed, that other pain- 
ful suggestion be true, that they are from the facile 
pens of private secretaries, and only signed with the 
great name. 

But, beside these difficulties inherent in the so- 
licited contribution, the striking fact remains that 
the majority of the writers, made up of the prom- 
inent men of the time, are not writers at all, either 
by profession or experience. For the odds always 
are, that the man accustomed to handle men and 
things will not be able to handle words as well. To 
be sure, the theory is advanced that he who has 
anything worth the telling will find a way to tell 
it ; and there are some conspicuous examples, like 
General Grant, to prove it. Nevertheless there is 
something called literary art; and a very brave 
man, one finds, may tell a very poor story. That 
Workingman Jones organized, and carried to a suc- 
cessful close, the renowned and picturesque strike 
on the Arizona Central Railroad is no proof that 
he will not make a lamentable failure in trying to 
tell us how he did it. 

Aside from this lack of literary skill, for which 
a man eager to impart information may be pardoned, 
there is another difficulty lying across his path. The 
leading men of any calling have their attention so 
completely absorbed by its countless details, that for 
them to give a clear and concise description of it is 
almost impossible. They live too much in the in- 
tense, white light of their subject to see its proper 
proportions, and relation to the surrounding objects. 
To the distinguished Professor Pterodactyl, by far 
the most interesting and important detail of Paleon- 
tology is the discussion now waging between him and 
Professor Trilobite, as to what animal once owned 
the second toe, which has just been found in the 
Lower Miocene of Wyoming. To us, the unlearned 
"general readers," the only interesting things in 
Paleontology are a few general principles which 
to Professor Pterodactyl are but the a, b, c's of 
his science, and worthy of mention only in primers. 
The writer who is primarily something else, is too 
apt to assume that his readers understand those de- 
tails which to him are a matter of course, and expends 
his energy on such points of special importance as 
at the time happen to be of immediate concern to 
himself. 

Notwithstanding all this, it would seem that from 



these new writers we ought to get a freshness of 
information, a spiciness of authentic gossip, else- 
where unattainable. From the men who are mak- 
ing history, may we not expect the most informing 
glimpses of how it is made ? And yet the candid 
reader must confess, it is seldom that we get it. 
When one comes to think about the matter, how- 
ever, it becomes plain that the man in authority, 
the man most deeply interested in any affair, is just 
the one who cannot reveal secrets, or lay bare the 
idiosyncracies of his associates. If he is deeply in- 
terested, he cannot be non-partisan. If he be the 
Silver King or the Gold Bug, his opinions must 
have that proper metallic ring which his followers 
expect. If the Democratic Senator from Alaska 
gives us an article on the " Leaders of the Demo- 
cratic Party," he may be a mine of exactly such in- 
formation as the public is longing for such as, how 
his worthy colleague has lately lost his political grip 
in the State of Alaska, and with it his once brilliant 
chances for the Presidency; and yet he cannot tell 
us all this, both because he knows his colleague per- 
sonally, and because he has political ambitions of his 
own. A freedom of speech, such as would be al- 
lowed the most obscure newspaper reporter, would 
involve the great leader in a network of criticism, 
and hand him over helpless to his enemies. So he 
must remain tongue-tied on those very subjects of 
which he knows more than anyone else. 

This, indeed, must be the reason why so many of 
these much-heralded special articles have the effect 
of a mere official report, from which everything per- 
sonal or interesting has been cut out, leaving only 
such items as the managers think it wise the public 
should know. 

After all, we are forced to admit that a title-page, 
though it includes the Master of the Knights of 
Labor, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on 
the Tariff, the Leader of the French Radicals, the 
General of the Salvation Army, and Queen Liliuok- 
alani, may, like some gaudy circus-posters, promise 
much and produce little.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

JAPANESE METAPHOR AND SIMILE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the course of an article in the December " Atlan- 
tic" on "The Eternal Feminine," relating chiefly to 
Japanese art and Japanese women, the author, Mr. 
Lafcadio Hearn, gives his readers to understand, with 
circumstance and citation, that metaphors and allegories 
are practically unknown to the Japanese language, and 
(quoting Professor Chamberlain), " incapable of so much 
as explanation to Far-Easte.rn minds." This is cer- 
tainly a little staggering to those of us who are familiar 
with current theories as to the part that metaphor plays 
in the formation of language. How are we to reconcile 
these discordancies ? 

I have before me a pamphlet, distributed as a tract 
among the members of the Parliament of Religions of 



40 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



the recent World's Fair, entitled " Outlines of the Ma- 
hayana as taught by Buddha," purporting to be written 
by a Japanese in Japanese, and to be translated by 
others of the same nation into English, and the trans- 
lation is a quaint and graceful piece of English, too. 
The imprimatur, also in Japanese, is " Asaknsa, Tokyo, 
Japan, 26th Year of Meiji (1893)." A hasty reading 
reveals more than a dozen formal similes in the thirty 
odd pages of this little composition. 

Two theories, I suppose, may be advanced to explain 
away the presence of these similes: one, that the trans- 
lators put them there to please the vulgar Occidental 
taste; the other, that the author put them there for 
much the same reason. Otherwise we must infer that 
the Japanese mind also delights in analogy, especially 
when it is formal and conscious. But is there, then, a 
race that knows not the penetrative imagination ? And 
is there a language that always inserts the term of com- 
parison, in which simile never deepens to metaphor ? 
Perhaps Professor Chamberlain and Mr. Hearn wish 
us to understand that only metaphors involving some 
degree of personification are banished from Japan. I 
am struck with the wholesomely objective air of most 
of the similes in the pamphlet to which I have referred. 
Each is a picture in itself. " The sound of a large bell 
reaches far and wide, but the bell must be rung; the 
doctrines of a great sage are by no means restricted to 
a small district, but opportunities for their propagation 
must be utilized." "This . . . fallacious view . . . 
may be likened to the effort of binding the moon upon 
the water with the hair of tortoises." Another heresy 
is << likened to the attempt of making a ship sail on a 
plain." Another " may be compared to the action of 
the ignorant monkey that tries to catch the image of 
the moon upon water." "Heaven and hell are but 
waves in the great sea of the universe." A language 
void of personification would be the happy concomitant 
of an objective and purely naturalistic art, and of a 
race seeking Anatman non-individuality."

DIALECTAL SURVIVALS FROM SPENSER. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As a student of language, I have always been inter- 
ested in observing provincialisms and dialectal peculiar- 
ities. It is a fact long since pointed out that many of 
these peculiarities are survivals from earlier periods of 
our literature. I once took occasion to compare some 
of our modern dialect writers with Shakespeare, and in 
a short time found examples of parallels for about forty 
words and expressions not now in good use. In read- 
ing the first two books of Spenser's " Faery Queene " 
not long since, I jotted down the following examples: 

Kilt, as the participle of kill, rhyming with guilt and 
spilt. 

His chosen people purg'd from sinful guilt 
With pretious blood, which cruelly was spilt 
On cursed tree, of that unspotted Lam, 
That for the sinnes of al the world was kilt." 

Chaw, in its three forms, occurs in the two quotations 
next given: 

" And next to him malicious Envy rode 
Upon a ravenous wolfe, and still did chaw 
Between his cankred teeth a venomous tode, 
That all the poison ran about his chaw ; 
But inwardly he chawed his owne maw." 



And the line: 

"And chawing vengeaunce all the way I went." 
Chaw was in good use much later than Spenser. In the 
fourth line quoted above, chaw is the noun which is 
modified through the influence of the French joue into 
jaw. 

Fift and sixl, still common with ignorant people, oc- 
cur in the tenth canto of the first book: 

" The fift had charge sick persons to attend . . . 
The sixt had charge of them now being dead." 

Of course the h does not occur in the Anglo-Saxon form 
of these words. 

Pore, a pronunciation of poor often heard, is found 
in these lines: 

" Whose welth was want, whose plenty made him pore, 
Who had enough, yet wished ever more." 

This spelling of the word is found frequently in " Piers 
Plowman." It is a shortened form of the Old French 
povre, which becomes in Modern French pauvre. 
Ketch for catch occurs in this line: 

" To ketch him at a vauntage in his snares." 
In another passage, ketch of the first edition (rhyming 
with wretch) is supplanted by light upon in the second. 
Divelish, in the expression " divelish yron engin," can 
be matched in Shakespeare. 

Examples of afeard, with a variety of spellings, can 
be given from Langland, Chaucer, Spenser, and Shake- 
speare. Here is one from the eleventh canto of the first 
book of "The Faery Queene": 

" A flake of fire, that, flashing in his beard, 
Him all amazed, and almost made afeard : 
The scorching flame sore swinged all his face." 

I do not doubt that the influence of the \rordfear has 
been great in retaining this pronunciation of afraid 
among uneducated people. 

The quotation last given contains another word that 
must be noticed swinged. Swinge for singe is still 
heard. 

An additional d occurs in vild in: 

" And sold thy selfe to serve Duessa vild." 
The adjective vylde and the adverb vildly are found in* 
the third canto of the first book. This excrescent d is- 
not uncommon after I in words like alder, Anglo-Saxon 
air, and after n in words like sound, French son, Latin 
sonus. 

In the following line the metre requires contrary to> 
be accented on the second syllable: 

"To be contrary to the worke which ye intend." 
As it is also in " Hamlet ": 

" Our wills and fates do so contrary run." 
And Milton: 

" And with contrary blast proclaims most deeds." 
And the old nursery rhyme: 

"Mary, Mary, quite contrary.'"

ART AND ETHICS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read, in your issue of Dec. 1, a very pleasing 
and suggestive paper on Art and Ethics by Prof. John 
G. Dow; and it is with no desire to criticize that writer 
that I would try to indicate more clearly a distinction 
at which he, perhaps from a lack of space, hardly more 
than hinted. 

Ethics, as I understand the matter, has two points 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



41 



of relationship with Art. The first relationship is that 
with the single work poem, painting, statue, or mu- 
sical composition; the second is that with many pic- 
tures, poems, musical compositions, or statues. In the 
first relationship, the office of Ethics is merely that of 
determining whether or not the work of art produces 
pleasant feelings; in the second, it is that of determin- 
ing whether or not the effect of the aesthetic feelings in 
the formation of character is good. The first question 
involves methods and results proximate in character; 
the second, methods and results remote in effect. 

A work of art is complete in itself. It needs noth- 
ing to interpret it or make its effects greater. It 
is unlike a machine or a work of science; the dis- 
tinction between these and works of art being that 
whereas the work of art has for its aim the production 
of one single pleasurable feeling or state of conscious- 
ness, and that immediately and directly, the machine 
aims at indirectly and remotely serving in the produc- 
tion of pleasures. If we compare a work of art with 
a didactic work we shall discover the same difference: 
one directly causes emotions of the highest order, the 
other remotely serves some utilitarian end. The meth- 
ods show a similar difference. The aim of art being that 
of directly causing a pleasurable feeling or emotion to 
come into consciousness, it would be impossible for a 
work of art to produce an unpleasant feeling as the to- 
tality of its effect; but the machine or didactic work 
may produce unpleasant or even painful feelings, and 
yet the ends will justify the means. 

By this law technique becomes the work of the arti- 
san ; the selecting and grouping, the work of the artist. 
This would in no way make technique any the less nec- 
essary, or the demand for technical perfection any the 
less distinct; it would only serve to emphasize the fact 
that technique and art are not to be confounded. Tech- 
nique is but the handmaid of art; it is, and must be, 
mechanical, for it is the means to an end ; but the more 
perfect the means, other things being equal, the better 
is the end attained. To be a master of technique in 
verse, to be able to put ideas into beautiful forms, can 
by no means make poets of even the best of versifiers; 
for with the mastery of words and images there is lack- 
ing in their work the complete harmonious concept of 
beauty, the concept which as a whole is capable of pro- 
ducing aesthetic feeling. The more nearly they embody 
such a concept in their works, the more nearly they be- 
come poets; and where such a concept is so embodied 
we have the aesthetically pleasant feeling and the poem. 
On the other hand, given beautiful ideas, poetical ideas, 
with imperfect technique, and the ideas will not appeal 
to the mind with the force in which they should. The 
aesthetic effect is lessened by the faults of technique, of 
expression. Those who exalt technique, fine-word hunt- 
ing, beautiful single sayings or ideas, concepts, to the 
position of true art, must ever feel that there is a some- 
thing higher. They exalt harmony of sound and of 
single themes to the scale in perfection held by a Chopin 
Mazurka. It is the finger of Apollo without Apollo; 
the eye of the eagle without the soaring wings. 

The other point of relationship of Ethics and Art is 
in the educational element. " Those who have dreamed 
will dream; those who have drunk will drink," says 
Hugo; and those who have had aesthetic feelings from 
works of art will think and dream in art as those works 
make them think and dream. Art cannot make use 
of unpleasant feelings except by shrouding them in those 
that are pleasant; and the height of the pleasure is 



to be measured by the height of the feeling induced. 
The higher aesthetic feelings are made more possible by 
the previous experience of those almost as high. They 
are more easily brought into existence the more often 
the mind has felt either them or those similar to them. 
Ethics has merely to determine whether or not the 
whole tendency of aesthetic experience is toward higher 
and more pleasurable feelings or tends to stasis or de- 
terioration. If the tendency is to higher ideas and 
keener delight, it is good; if not, it is not good. A 
photograph of a friend may be a cause of more pleas- 
ure than a picture of the Madonna; but art takes but 
little or no cognizance of the individual, turning all its 
attention to the universal. Ethically, it must do so; aes- 
thetically, not so of necessity. Yet the distinction be- 
tween greatness and the other extreme is to be meas- 
ured by the degree of universality of the feeling caused 
in the auditors or beholders. The Madonna will put- 
last the photograph, even as the world outlasts the in- 
dividual. And likewise that which has value because 
of its power to arouse feelings that are eternal will out- 
last the temporal because this embodies only that which 
passes away. The didactic is but temporary ; prejudice 
is temporary as temporary as is the truthfulness or 
usefulness of the teaching, or the existence of the causes- 
of the prejudice. Science may be unceasingly correct- 
ing itself; but true art never corrects. And the reason 
is that true art embodies the highest of emotions, emo- 
tions that are as permanent as human character love, 
sympathy, feelings of beauty in nature. These are as 
permanent as the associations of man; they will exist 
when and where our theories of morals are extinct, 
where our religion has no force, when universal broth- 
erhood has succeeded international war. To be able to 
call into existence the eternal pleasurable feelings of 
the highest of universal minds, is the office of art; and 
ethics approves such, as it approves all things that are 
good, stamping as better those that give the highest 
of pleasurable emotions, and as lower those that less 
ably serve to do so. Technique may enhance the power 
of the work or-the height of the feeling, but can never 
alone create the work or the feeling. And hence it is 
that those who master style and not ideas have nothing- 
that can lay claim to artistic excellence or permanence. 
Style may be acquired, but artistic ideas come only 
from large education, large power of feeling, a large 
mind. HARVEY C. ALFORD.

"IS BEING BUILT." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg the favor of your inserting this short note. 

In THE DIAL of December 1, where I specify re- 
cent users of expressions like is being built, you have 
excised the names of Mr. G. J. Caley, the Earl of Car- 
lisle, Arthur H. Clough, Mr. Richard Congreve, Prof. 
J. Conington, Mr. Bernard Cracroft, Sir George \\ . 
Dasent, Prof. A. De Morgan, and those of Bp. Thirlwall, 
Sir George O. Trevelyan, Anthony Trollope, Rev. R. E. 
Tyrwhitt, Eliot Warburton, Major George Warburton, 
H. W. Wilberforce, Prof. H. H. Wilson, Bp. Christopher 
Wordsworth, Miss C. M. Yonge. 

The omission of these names would, to some, argu,e a 
very imperfect acquaintance, on my part, with the En- 
glish literature of the last seventy years. p jj

THE OLD REGIME ix FRAXCE.* 

The first instalment of the "Memoirs of 
Chancellor Pasquier " is not likely to disap- 
point readers whose anticipations are based on 
a knowledge of the author's career and of his 
social and political affiliations. What such 
knowledge justifies one in expecting, he gives 
us in abundance ; and his book is therefore, its 
field and standpoint considered, a notable ad- 
dition to the literature of the Revolutionary and 
Napoleonic periods. The Chancellor was not, 
in the quality of his political equipment, a Tur- 
got or a Mirabeau, nor indeed did statesman- 
ship then, as now, necessarily imply a minute 
and accurate acquaintance with the condition 
of the people. With the class of facts that 
constitute the staple of the great works of De 
Tocqueville and of Tainef Chancellor Pasquier 
seems to have been, from the modern view, 
strangely unfamiliar. What, for instance, must 
be the surprise of the student of De Tocque- 
ville to find this quondam Chancellor of France 
and Minister of the Interior assigning as a re- 
sult of the Revolution a fact which was cer- 
tainly not the least among its contributory 
causes the partition of landed property ! " It 
is," says De Tocqueville, " a vulgar error to 
suppose that the subdivision of property in 
France dates from the Revolution," an event 
which did not divide, but freed land. Twenty 
years before the outbreak we find agricultural 
societies deploring the cutting-up of farm lands ; 
and a few years later Necker observed that the 
number of small rural properties had become 
" immense." This extensive passing of landed 
property from the hands of a thriftless and 
needy noblesse* whose original function of hold- 
ing and defending it vi et armis had long lapsed, 
into the hands of a frugal peasantry who con- 
tinued to dwell upon it and to till it, in fact her- 
alded the new order of things in France. It 
brought into full relief the abuses and anomalies 
of an outworn system, rendering them doubly 
odious and more plainly unjustifiable. In the 
ancient feudal society the seignior's claims upon

t We take pleasure in commending, as an excellent popular 
substitute for the rather formidable works on the Old Regime 
by these two writers, Mr. E. J. Lowell's "The Eve of the 
French Revolution"- a succinct treatise full of suggestive 
facts and acute comment. 



his tenants were counterpoised by extensive obli- 
gations. By the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury these obligations had entirely passed to 
the central government, but the seigniorial 
rights, in great part, remained ; and French- 
men, growing sensitive as they grew indepen- 
dent, began to resent the anomaly. Why, they 
argued, should the farmer pay taxes, not to the 
government, but to certain neighbors, who, al- 
beit titled or privileged, have no more public 
authority and no more to do with public bus- 
iness than he ? These neighbors met and im- 
peded the harassed proprietor at every turn. 
They compelled him to work on their land on 
set days without pay ; they prevented him from 
killing the game which ravaged his crops ; if 
he crossed the river he must pay them toll ; if 
he took his produce to market he must pay 
them for the right to sell it ; he must grind his 
corn at the seigniorial mill, bake his bread at 
the seigniorial oven, press his grapes at the 
seigniorial wine-press. In some seigniories there 
was even a prescriptive seigniorial bull. In a 
letter written shortly before the Revolution, by 
a peasant to an Intendant, we learn that, 

" The whole country is infected with rents. Most of 
the farm-lands pay every year a seventh of a bushel of 
wheat per acre, others wine ; one pays the seignior a 
fourth of all fruits, another a fifth, another a twelfth, 
another a thirteenth the tithes being always paid on 
the gross. These rights are so singular that they vary 
from a fourth part of the produce to a fortieth. What 
must be thought of the rents in kind in vegetables, 
poultry, labor, wood, fruit, candles ? I am acquainted 
with rents which are paid in bread, in wax, in eggs, in 
headless pigs, in rose shoulder-knots, in bouquets of vio- 
lets, in golden spurs, etc. ; and there are a host of seign- 
iorial dues besides these." 

What we are to bear in mind is that for these 
rents and dues there was, in most cases, abso- 
lutely nothing rendered in return. Reciprocity 
of service, the original bond between lord and 
tenant, between the local defender of the land 
and its cultivator, had gradually disappeared 
with the growth of the monarchy. To rid ac- 
quired estates of the burden of irredeemable 
feudal rents and services whose raison d'etre

searching the stock debates as to whether this 
and that royal or noble personage who paid for 
the sins of their order on the Place de la Rev- 
olution did, by " dying game," thereby win the 
crown of martyrdom and the halo of sainthood. 
Despite his leaven of enlightened liberalism, 
Chancellor Pasquier was and remained essen- 
tially a man of the Old Regime, a statist with 
whom politics was a game to be played by and 
primarily for the privileged orders. He plainly 
detects a taint of heresy in the thesis of the 
Abbe Sieyes, that it were unjust to postpone 
longer the interests of the twenty-five millions 
of Frenchmen whose function in the State was 
production, in favor of the one and one-half 
millions of Frenchmen whose function was con- 
sumption. Touching the condition of the most 
numerous grade of these twenty-five millions of 
producing Frenchmen, he seems to have held 
some vague optimistic notions, tinged, perhaps, 
to the last by the ideas current in his youth, 
when polished society, inspired by the gospel 
according to Jean Jacques, conceived the peas- 
ant as the amiable swain, the gentle shepherd 
of the pipe and the crook, affectionate, grate- 
ful, right-minded, easily led a mild Arcadian 
in short, tuneful and stomachless, and a charm- 
ing accessory to the landscape. Who has not 
smiled at the description so characteristic of 
the period of Marie Antoinette, in frock of 
white muslin, gauze neckerchief, and straw hat, 
with the daintiest of crooks, tending her be- 
ribboned sheep on the slopes at the Little Tria- 
non ! Such was the fashionable ideal of " the 
farmer's wife," the paysanne remote enough, 
certainly, from the squalid reality : from, say, 
La Bruyere's " savage-looking beings, black, 
livid, and sunburnt," digging and grubbing at 
the soil from sunrise to sunset " with invincible 
stubbornness," and retiring at night " into their 
dens, where they live on black bread, water, 
and roots "; or from Arthur Young's peasant- 
women of Normandy, " in reality walking dung- 
hills," obscene objects which, happily, " it is 
not in the power of an English imagination to 
figure." It is not easy, in the light of induc- 
tive sociology, to view the social vagaries of 
Rousseauism seriously ; to realize that men en- 
dowed with eyes to see and with ears to hear, 
and standing, as it were, within a stone's-throw 
of the fact, actually believed in the idyllic 
Jacques Bonhomme, legislated for him, and 
framed schemes of government deduced from 
his virtues. Perhaps the wish was father to 
the belief. It was so much pleasanter (the 
grim tradition of the Jacquerie still haunting 



the seigniorial pillow) to view the rustic in the 
pages of Marmontel, Floriau, Bitaube, or in 
the drawing-room idyls, than to face the sordid 
and menacing reality. 

We are not, however, to conclude from the 
general condition of the French peasant in the 
eighteenth century that the feudal burden laid 
on him was heavier than that borne by his 
neighbors in other parts of the continent. De 
Tocqueville has pointed out the paradoxical fact 
that the revolt against feudal institutions broke 
out precisely in the country where the burden of 
those institutions, though still onerous enough, 
was lightest. At the close of the century serf- 
dom prevailed, for instance, over the greater 
part of Germany, the peasant still forming, as 
in the Middle Ages, virtually part of the stock on 
lands. The soldiers in the armies of Maria The- 
resa and of Frederick were mostly absolute serfs. 
Nothing of the kind had existed for many years 
in France. One may readily see, however, how 
(as we have already tried to point out) the de- 
struction of a part of the feudal system, followed 
by a measure of popular enlightenment, must 
have rendered the remainder a hundred-fold 
more hateful than the whole had ever appeared. 
The Frenchman, dimly descrying Liberty on 
his political horizon, grew sensible of his tram- 
mels. The prime cause of his misery was, of 
course, taxation ; and to the spoliations of the 
nobility and the clergy were added those of the 
State. Enormous sums were needed by Louis 
XIV. for his wars, and by Louis XV. for his 
orgies, his pare aux cerfs and kindred unspeak- 
abilities ; and recourse was had to the class 
least able to furnish them. An able statistician 
has calculated that the peasant in many parts 
of France paid away four-fifths of his income 
to the Treasury, the seignior, and the Church, 
retaining out of every hundred francs he earned 
little more than eighteen francs himself. No 
poor man escaped the tax-gatherer. Says Taine : 

" The garret and the hut, as well as the farm and the 
farm-house, know the collector, the constable, and the 
bailiff; no hovel escapes the detestable brood. The peo- 
ple sow, harvest their crops, work, and undergo privation 
for their benefit; and, should the farthings so painfully 
saved each week amount, at the end of the year, to a 
piece of silver, the mouth of their pouch closes over it." 

The unprivileged Frenchman, then, in this 
golden age of the old noblesse, was, according 
to unimpeachable evidence, literally taxed to 
the verge of the grave and often beyond it ; 
and yet we find Chancellor Pasquier compla- 
cently alluding to the happy general condition 
of the country under " the regime which pre- 
ceded '89," and, notably, during the reign of

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



Louis XV. an infamous character who squan- 
dered on a single strumpet three millions ster- 
ling wrung from the neediest of his subjects, 
and the literal record of whose private life 
would beggar the pen of a Rabelais. Let us 
glance briefly at a few facts recorded of this 
'* halcyon " pre-revolutionary period. In 1725, 
says St. Simon, " the people in Normandy live 
on the grass of the fields. The first king in 
Europe is great simply by turning his kingdom 
into a vast hospital of dying people from whom 
their all is taken without a murmur." In the 
most prosperous days of Fleury and in the 
finest region in France, the peasant hides " his 
wine on account of the excise and his bread on 
account of the faille, convinced that he is a 
lost man if any doubt exists of his dying of 
starvation." In 1739, D'Argenson writes, in 
the canton of Touraine, " men have been eating 
herbage more than a year "; while in the bish- 
opric of Chartres " the famine and the mor- 
tality were such that men ate grass like sheep 
and died like so many flies." Reading these 
records one apprehends better the symbolism 
of that ghastly street - spectacle of the Paris 
mob bearing aloft on a pike the gory head of 
Officer Foulon, the mouth filled with grass 
the food he had commended to the starving 
wretches who applied to him for assistance. In 
1840 Massillon wrote to Fleury: 

" The people of the rural districts are living in fright- 
ful destitution, without beds, without furniture; the 
majority, for half the year, even lack barley and oat 
bread, their sole food, and which they are compelled to 
take out of their own and their children's mouths to 
pay the taxes." 

In the same year, at Chatellerault, he says : 

" The poor outnumber those able to live without beg- 
ging . . . while prosecutions for unpaid dues are car- 
ried on with unexampled rigor. The clothes of the poor 
are seized, and their last measure of flour, the latches 
on their doors," etc. 

Ten years later the evil is greater. D'Argen- 
son writes : 

" In the country around me, ten leagues from Paris, 
I find increased privation and constant complaints. 
What must it be in our wretched provinces in the in- 
terior . . . where the collectors with their officers, 
accompanied by locksmiths, force open the doors and 
carry off and sell furniture for one-quarter of its value. 
... I see poor people dying of destitution. ... An 
assessor, on coming to the village where I have my 
country-house, states that the faille this year will be 
much increased ; he noticed that the peasants here were 
fatter than elsewhere; that they had chicken-feathers 
before their doors, etc. . . . Some of the seigniors of 
Touraine inform me that, being desirous of setting the 
inhabitants to work by the day, they found very few of 
them, and these so weak that they were unable to use 
their arms." 



Even at Paris one finds that, in 1753, in the 
faubourg St. Antoine, over eight hundred per- 
sons died of privation in a single month ; that 
" the poor expire with cold and hunger in their 
garrets, without any possible relief." As to the 
last thirty years preceding the Revolution, it is 
enough to say that during that time the popular 
condition was no whit mended. The effect upon 
French agriculture of a system under which the 
least sign of prosperity sufficed to bring down 
upon the hapless cultivator a swarm of fiscal 
harpies, may be imagined. Countless farms in 
the fairest provinces of France were abandoned. 
Not even the guillotine could have compelled 
men (as was shown, later, to the abundant sat- 
isfaction of the zealots of the Terror) to sow 
where they might not reap, to weave where they 
might not wear. In Auvergne, we learn, " the 
country is depopulated daily." In Comminges, 
at the outbreak of the Revolution, certain com- 
munities threatened to abandon their possessions 
should they obtain no relief. " It is a well-known 
fact," says the Assembly of Haute-Guyenne, in 
1784, "that the lot of the most severely taxed 
communities is so rigorous as to have led their 
proprietors frequently to abandon their prop- 
erty." In Gascony the spectacle is " heart- 
rending." About 1760, according to the best 
observers, "one-quarter of the soil of France 
is absolutely lying waste ; . . . hundreds and 
hundreds of arpents of heath and moor form 
extensive deserts." " Let a person traverse 
Anjou, Maine, Brittany, Poitou, Limousin, la 
Marche, Berry, Nivernaise, Bourbonnais, and 
Auvergne, and he finds one-half of these prov- 
inces in heaths, forming immense plains, all of 
which might be cultivated." In short, the re- 
gime invented by Louis XIV. (and viewed not 
unfavorably by Chancellor Pasquier) had pro- 
duced its effect ; French soil was reverting to a 
wild state. "Thus abandoned," says Taine, 
" by the spade and the plough, a vast portion 
of the soil ceases to feed man, while the rest, 
poorly cultivated, scarcely provides the simplest 
necessities." 

To a recital of the abuses of the Old Order 
it is always fair to add that, immediately be- 
fore the Revolution, there was a general, if be- 
lated, tendency on the part of the class that 
had profited by them to assist in their removal. 
But the wind had been sown, and it remained 
to reap the whirlwind. The spirit of radi- 
calism, though not predominant, was astir in 
France, and it had at its beck and call a law- 
less and relentless horde of social pariahs, the 
very existence of which is the gravest count

in the indictment against the Anclen Regime. 
In the Assembly that met at Versailles to dis- 
cuss reforms sat not only men like Cazales, 
D'Espremenil, Mounier, Mirabeau, the La- 
meths ; but the Potions and the Robespierres, 
at heart root-and-branch men, and the germ of 
that alert, organized, and determined minority 
who were, despite their benign democratic 
ideals, soon to rule France with a despotism 
never before parallelled, and under which the 
ruled could not even establish their right to 
live. To such men surgery, a cutting-away of 
parts corrupt or inert, was the true cure for 
the diseased body politic ; and a suitable instru- 
ment was (thanks to Dr. Guillotin) soon ready 
to their hand. The crimes and follies of Louis 
XIV. and Louis XV. were to be atoned for by 
Louis XVI. an amiable, well-intentioned man 
who might, had he lived and applied himself, 
have made an indifferent locksmith. Certainly, 
the sickle of the guillotine reaped away few heads 
less deserving than his of such a fate. Chancel- 
lor Pasquier was present, involuntarily, at the 
King's execution ; and he describes the scene, 
not minutely, but with the shuddering reluct- 
ance of an unwilling eye-witness that lends 
force to his words : 

" It remains for me to say that I saw the tragedy 
which was enacted on the 21st of January. I lived in 
a house which faced on the boulevard, at the corner of 
the church of the Madeleine. My father and I sat op- 
posite each other all morning, buried in our grief and 
unable to utter a word. We knew that the fatal pro- 
cession was wending its way by the boulevards. Sud- 
denly a somewhat loud clamor made itself heard. I 
rushed out under the idea that perhaps an attempt was 
being made to rescue the king. How could I do other- 
wise than cherish such a hope to the very last ? On 
reaching the goal I discovered that what I had heard 
was merely the howling of the raving madmen who sur- 
rounded the vehicle. I found myself sucked in by the 
crowd which followed it, and was dragged away by it, 
and, so to speak, carried and set down by the scaffold's 
side. So it was that I endured the horror of this awful 
spectacle. Hardly had the crime been consummated 
when a cry of ' Long live the Nation ! ' arose from the 
foot of the scaffold, and, repeated from man to man, 
was taken up by the whole of the vast concourse of peo- 
ple. This cry was followed by the deepest and most 
gloomy silence. Shame, horror, and terror were now 
hovering over the vast locality." 

Later, another execution was witnessed by 
the Chancellor this time not so reluctantly : 

" Fate led me to the Palais de Justice on one of the 
days of Fouquier-Tinville's trial. I was unable to re- 
sist the desire of seeing with my own eyes this great act 
of divine justice, so I went in. ... In that room had 
sat the revolutionary tribunal. Into it had come, as 
prisoners, the Queen, Mme. Elizabeth, M. de Male- 
sherbes, the members of the Paris Parlement, and lastly 
my father. Thence, all of them had started for the 



scaffold, in company of so many more. And it was in 
that place that I saw sitting in the dock, into which he 
had so long brought his victims, the monster the men- 
tion of whose name had so often made me shudder. . . . 
I certainly did not think I was to see that man again, 
yet fate had it in store for me that certain business 
should take me to the Hotel de Ville the day of his ex- 
ecution, and I saw his head fall. He struggled against 
his doom like the coward that he was." 

Before closing, let us glance at Chancellor 
Pasquier's account of the fall of the Bastille, 
an event which, however important symbolic- 
ally, seems to have been in itself, if we are to 
believe the Chancellor, little more than an ex- 
aggerated street row. It may be instructive to 
compare the following pallid report of an eye- 
witness with Mr. Carlyle's dithyrambic version : 

" I was present at the taking of the Bastille. What 
has been styled the fight was not serious, for there was 
absolutely no resistance shown. Within the hold's walls 
were neither provisions nor ammunition. It was not 
even necessary to invest it. The regiment of gardes 
franpaises which led the attack presented itself under 
the walls on the rue Saint-Antoine side, opposite the 
main entrance, which was barred by a drawbridge. 
There was a discharge of a few musket-shots, to which 
no reply was made, and then four or five discharges 
from a cannon. It has been claimed that the latter 
broke the chains of the drawbridge. I did not notice 
this, and yet I was standing close to the point of attack. 
What I did see plainly was the action of the soldiers, 
invalides, or others, grouped on the platform of the 
high tower, holding their muskets stock in air, and ex- 
pressing by all means employed under similar circum- 
stances their desire of surrendering. . . . The truth is, 
that this great fight did not for a moment frighten the 
numerous spectators who had flocked to witness its re- 
sult. Among them were many women of fashion, who, 
in order to be closer to the scene, had left their carriages 
some distance away. . . . By my side stood Mile. Con- 
tat, of the Come'die-Franc.aise. We stayed together till 
the very end, and then I gave her my arm back to her 
carriage, which had waited in the place Royale." 

It is hard to reconcile the writer's " abso- 
lutely no resistance shown " with the historical 
one hundred or more dead besiegers, with the 
subsequent fury of the mob, and the massacre 
of De Launay and six of the garrison. Perhaps 
the well-born Chancellor looked grudgingly on 
events which seemed to startled Europe to ring 
out the old and ring in the new ; events which 
even dispassionate Immanuel Kant in distant 
Konigsberg, foreseeing a new Golden Age, 
hailed with tears of joy, saying to his friends, 
" I can now say, like Simeon : ' Lord, let thy 
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen 
Thy salvation.' " Unhappily, the too-sanguine 
philosopher lived to see the crowning of Napo- 
leon Bonaparte. 

Chancellor Pasquier (1767-1862) was suc- 
cessively councillor in the parliament of Paris

MODERN PSYCHOLOGY AND DAILY LIFE.* 

A most welcome sign of the tendency of mod- 
ern psychology to develop along lines of real 
and natural interest is to be found in the va- 
rious applications of psychological principles 
to education, to history, to the treatment of the 
defective classes, to the origin of illusion and 
error, and to countless experiences in daily life. 
The conception of the psychologist as one who 
deals in abstract and out-of-the-way mental en- 
tities, classifying with ever-increasing refine- 
ment his peculiar collection of specimens and 
ever disputing with his colleagues over their 
proper labels, a conception warranted by a 
perusal of text-books published not many dec- 
ades ago, must give way to a far different 
view, in which the psychologist appears at every 
point in close touch with the vital problems of 
science and of life. He still finds it necessary 
to analyze closely, to draw fine distinctions, and 
to use technical language ; but he never forgets 
the end for which such accessories, like the 
technicalities of physics or of chemistry, have 
been adopted. 

It is as an example of the application of psy- 
chology to history that Dr. Ireland's work, " The 
Blot upon the Brain," now appearing in a sec- 
ond edition, deserves especial mention. The 
thesis which the major portion of these essays 
illustrates is that a correct view of the charac- 
ters and actions of many of the important per-

Psychology. By W. W. Ireland, M. D. New York : G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 



sonages of history can be obtained only from 
an understanding of certain psychological prin- 
ciples, and in particular from a careful analysis 
of what is meant by insanity, delusions, and 
the various forms of extravagance in thought 
and deed. Mere abnormality, a divergence 
from the common average, is of course not in- 
sanity ; it is in such deviation from tfie standard 
of the hoi polloi that genius and madness find 
one point of alliance. And apart from any de- 
sire to reach a practical definition of insanity, 
it must be remembered that a class of actions 
and beliefs which a few centuries ago would 
have passed unnoticed, would to-day render one 
liable to examination for mental unsoundness ; 
and again, the manifestations that under a dif- 
ferent psychology subjected the unfortunate 
possessed one to persecutions and tortures, or 
under other circumstances were interpreted as 
divine inspirations, are to-day treated in the 
sheltering care of an asylum. Although a su- 
perficial survey is thus sufficient to accent the 
necessity of interpreting conduct with full ref- 
erence to its historical environment, there yet 
remains abundant opportunity for an inquiry 
regarding the share of conduct in certain types 
of greatness that is due to unusual ability and 
the share that must be ascribed to developments 
of character differing perhaps in degree, but 
not in kind, from those that characterize in- 
sanity. " In ancient times, and amongst half- 
civilized nations, things were done in the name 
of religion which none but men of the weakest 
mental structure would now do ; but the rule 
we would apply to the one time will not hold 
good for the other." 

Dr. Ireland finds in the lives of Mohammed 
and Luther and Joan of Arc the-best illustra- 
tions of historically important events springing 
from and guided by semi-morbid tendencies. 
It would be an abuse of language to call Mo- 
hammed insane, and to attempt to interpret the 
religion to which he gave rise as the accidental 
adoption, as inspired, of his hallucinations and 
ravings. "We do not seek to explain the na- 
ture or success of Mohammed's mission by his 
epilepsy. These lie in the character of the man 
and the circumstances of the times ; but we 
think that the starting-point of his hallucina- 
tions came through the nervous disorder which 
affected him and of which the epileptiform fits 
were the visible proof. It was this which held 
before his eyes and made to sound in his ears 
the hallucinations which led him to believe that 
he had a message from God. Without this, 
no amount of religious fervor or abstract mon- 



1894.]

otheism would have made him take such a view." 
When we consider the frequency with which 
religious devotion is a marked symptom of epi- 
lepsy, that Mohammed began his revela- 
tions only in his forty-second year, and that the 
attacks were probably not frequent enough to 
undermine his mental strength, we obtain at 
least a partial solution of the wonderfully suc- 
cessful and active career associated with such 
peculiar characteristics of person and times. In 
the case of Luther, the hallucinations played 
no part in his religious life, the reference of 
all untoward happenings to a personal devil 
arising naturally from the dominant conceptions 
of the time. How far Joan of Arc was insane, 
it is difficult to determine ; her remarkable 
career contains such a curious mixture of cre- 
dulity, extravagance, and sporadic ability, that 
the psychologist as well as the historian is left 
in doubt. And yet a knowledge of the nervous 
conditions prompting such actions has been in- 
fluential in creating a rational view of her place 
and character. Although Dr. Ireland must 
content himself with the statement, " I do not 
know any insane person who was like her, but 
she was not quite sane," yet the analysis upon 
which this conclusion is reached is suggestive 
of the close relation between her nervous con- 
dition and her historical importance. 

The " insanity of power " is the name given to 
the wild excesses of powerful tyrants who seem 
to act with perverted instincts and an absence 
of moral sense. The education of restraint has 
been absent in their training, and the result may 
be viewed as a reversion to a more savage state, 
characterized by a love of cruelty that comes 
as a symptom at certain periods of childhood, 
but is outgrown by normal individuals. The 
Claudian-Julian family, reaching a climax in 
the extravagances of Nero, forms the most 
striking instance of this malady ; while the his- 
tories of Mohammed Toghlak, and Ivan the 
Terrible show similar tendencies in other royal 
dynasties. The hereditary element in such dis- 
ease is its most awful factor, and is well por- 
trayed by Dr. Ireland in his chapter on the 
neurosis of the royal family in Spain. In all 
these cases, the influence upon historical events 
that may arise from perverted forms of mental 
action appears in a striking way. 

Dr. Ireland's volume contains other essays 
on a variety of topics interesting to the student 
of unusual mental phenomena. The nature of 
illusions and hallucinations is well set forth in 
the opening chapter of the volume. Fixed 
ideas which enslave the unfortunate victim, pro- 



duce irrational hopes and fears, prevent the 
accomplishment of the simplest actions or en- 
courage most extravagant ones, form the sub- 
ject of another chapter ; while the peculiarly 
contagious character of certain forms of insan- 
ity and unconscious cerebration furnish the 
material for other interesting discussions. Left- 
handedness and righthandedness is discussed 
in its relations to the nervous system. The 
question of the duality of the brain that is, 
the independent action of the two halves of the 
brain is a related topic ; and the curious mir- 
ror-writing, which occurs spontaneously in chil- 
dren, and seems also related to lefthandedness, 
offers a puzzling but important problem in the 
same field. Of quite special value is the essay 
upon the relation of thought to words. The 
evidence for the existence of thought without 
words is forcibly stated, and offers a welcome 
example of the illuminating power of psycholog- 
ical analysis upon a problem on which much 
inconclusive philological speculation has been 
expended. The knowledge of the physical 
basis of language that we derive from the study 
of the various forms of aphasia is also well set 
forth, as a contribution from the student of 
mental disease to the psychologist a contri- 
bution which has been termed " the most bril- 
liant jewel in Physiology." 

Dr. Ireland's collection of papers may be 
recommended as an interesting approach to 
many problems in practical psychology, an 
approach that suggests the wide extent of the 
domain to be entered upon, and the hopeful- 
ness of this mode of access ; an approach, too, 
that brings the field into close and vital rela- 
tions with a variety of intellectual and prac- 
tical interests. JOSEPH JASTROW.

understand well what they read, will thank Col- 
onel Dodge for his series of books on " Great

from the military point of view only, with no 
further discussion of social or personal charac- 
teristics than is necessary in presenting the man 
as a commander. The impetuosity of Alexander 
-and the cool, calculated daring of Caesar are 
essential parts of their characters as generals. 
Nor does Colonel Dodge offer a judgment in 
the famous case of The Roman Republic vs. 
Julius Caesar, wherein Cassius and Brutus did 
execution without trial. He does say, what no 
one who condemns Caesar's assumption of power 
can deny, that in the existing circumstances the 
actions of the Pompeian party and the official 
acts of the Senate were substantially a declara- 
tion of war. " Either rival was right in oppos- 
ing the sole exercise of authority by the other ; 
but we must judge mainly from the facts and 
from the other authorities, and not from the 
statements of Cassar, which was least to blame 
for the war that for years decimated the repub- 
lic " (p. 409). But this judgment upon poli- 
tics is merely incidental: he is portraying Caesar 
the general, Caesar the man that made the gen- 
eral, not Caesar the politician nor Caesar the 
statesman. Only at the end of the book does 
he sum up his character in a strong chapter on 
" The Man and Soldier."

refers, and is by the author referred, to the two 
previous volumes. They are connected both 
by these references and by the author's plan, 
which is to sketch the growth of the science and 
of the art of war, from earliest history down 
to Waterloo. Our review will therefore include 
in some measure the volumes on Alexander and 
Hannibal. 

Of the first volume, one-fourth, amounting 
to one hundred and eighty pages, is filled with 
discussions of wars and of military affairs before 
Alexander, including fifty-six pages on Philip 
and his military work. Here are reviewed Ori- 
ental arms and armies ; the wars of Cyrus and 
Darius ; Spartan and other Greek armies ; Mil- 
tiades and Marathon; Brasidas, Xenophon, 
Agesilaus, and Epaminondas. The author's 
judgments upon the generals commend them- 
selves to us; but we are amazed to see the 
merest imaginations and romantic stories of the 
Greeks spread upon the pages of the book, and 
even improved upon by Colonel Dodge's skill 
in narration. A full description of the battle 
of Thymbra is given (pp. 48-50), with com- 
ments upon the tactics of Cyrus. This story 
is from Xenophon's " Cyropsedia," a work 110 
more worthy of quotation as an authority than 
Scott's " Ivanhoe " or Flaubert's " Salammbo." 



It is well described by Mahaffy as " a very dif- 
fuse political novel," " the most theoretical and 
fanciful of Xenophon's works," of which Pro- 
fessor M. says : " It is idle to attempt to sift 
out the particles of history from the mass of 
fiction." Colonel Dodge says it has been sug- 
gested that Xenophon improved upon the actual 
manoeuvres, but that at least it shows what 
Xenophon knew how to do. Let him then pre- 
sent it, as Colonel Chesney gave us " the Battle 
of Dorking," as a clear excursus of the imagi- 
nation ; let it be Xenophon's and not Cyrus's 
battle. But Colonel Dodge repeatedly quotes 
the " Cyropaedia " as if it were history. 

Again, he narrates the Scythian campaign 
of Darius (pp. 53-55), accepting the fantastic 
details of Herodotus, and imputing to the scat- 
tered and utterly barbarous tribes north of the 
Danube a marvellous strategy. "These acts 
were not done in an irrational manner, but with 
the greatest forethought." Why did he not 
notice the criticisms upon Ctesias and Hero- 
dotus to be found in Grote? Colonel Dodge 
often cites Grote. Grote says : " That Darius 
actually marched into the country, there can be 
no doubt. Nothing else is certain, except his 
ignominious retreat out of it to the Danube. 
. . . But as to all which happened between his 
crossing and recrossing the Danube, we find 
nothing approaching to authentic statements, 
nor even what we can set forth as the probable 
basis of truth on which exaggerating fancy has 
been at work." But our author gravely com- 
pares it to the Russian campaign of Napoleon. 

We have found that Colonel Dodge brings 
to his work that useful element of the ability 
of a narrator, an active imagination ; but this, 
coupled with poor judgment as to facts and 
authorities, leads him sometimes astray. We are 
forced to distrust and to watch him. Another 
example of extravagance is found in the state- 
ment twice given (" Alexander," p. 20 ; " Han- 
nibal," p. 21), that in the Jewish army of the 
time of the Judges there was a body of slingers 
who " could cut a hair hung up as a target." 
How could an intelligent man fail to see that 
the words of the Bible " every one could sling 
stones at an hair-breadth and not miss " were 
an orientalism, a hyperbolic statement of accu- 
racy of aim ? And how far from the hair tar- 
get can the slinger stand and see his mark ? It 
is no orientalism to reply, not a hair's breadth 
beyond the length of his arm and of his sling. 
Again, how can any man who has practical 
acquaintance with affairs, and who witnessed 
the failure of our armies in attempts to divert

the Mississippi and the James, repeat the incred- 
ible stories of the turning of the Gyndes and 
the Euphrates by Cyrus ? Rawlinson, who is 
not slow to accept an incredibility, introduces 
the story of the Gyndes with an if: " if we may 
trust Herodotus." But we certainly can not 
trust Herodotus. Cyrus was not such an utter 
fool. ' " The canal which Sesostris had dug " 
must fail with the fable of Sesostris ; while the 
credibility of the diversion of the Euphrates 
hinges at last upon the supposed paving of a 
part of the bed of the river by the imaginary 
Nitocris. 

The Trojan War, too, which may have been 
mythical only, and certainly is not historical, is 
dated and discussed as a fact ; while it is really 
doubtful whether the Homeric descriptions of 
battles, which were principally duels between 
the mythic heroes, represent warfare as it actu- 
ally occurred at any time prior to the Middle 
Ages and Knighthood. 

Little errors occur frequently, showing want 
of an accurate habit. We are told that Themis- 
tocles commanded the centre at Marathon. It 
is known that Aristides was general of his tribe : 
it is not known that Themistocles held any com- 
mand ; and the stories that show his character at 
that time make it evidently improbable. " The 
Spartans marched to Marathon, 150 miles, in 
three days." But at the end of their three days' 
march they had reached Athens only, and were 
twenty-two miles from the battle-field, which 
they visited on the fourth day. Caesar's wife 
is called Julia: she was Cornelia; and before he 
married Calpurnia he had divorced the second 
wife, Pompeia. In "Caesar" (p. 21), a statement 
is made of the .ZEdui which should have been 
made of the Sequani, who are erroneously said 
on p. 20 to have asked Caesar's assistance. Mas- 
silia (Marseille) in " Hannibal " (p. 177) is 
called a Roman colony, which it never was ; while 
p. 8 had correctly called it Greek. In " Caesar" 
(p. 143) the description of Aquitania accords 
with the outline of the Augustan province of 
later date ; while Caesar himself makes the Ga- 
ronne the boundary of his Aquitania. " Caninius 
the Atrebatian " (p. 313) was really Commius ; 
Caninius was a Roman, the subject of Cicero's 
joke about the consul who never slept during 
his term of office. " Mithridates, King of 
Pergamos" (p. 584), is not known to history: 
Mithridates of Pergamus probably had that 
designation from his birthplace. The Sesos- 
tridae ("Alexander," pp. 21 and 23) can hardly 
be historical, since Sesostris is the product of 
a Greek imagination stirred by Egyptian fables 



of the conquests of their kings. But we leave 
this discussion of errors with the remark that 
the publishers ought to put upon such books a 
proof-reader who would not allow Carducians 
for Carduchians, Cindus for Cnidus, agyras- 
pids for argy rasp ids, or synapism (sadly sug- 
gestive of a mustard plaster) for synaspism 
(the arrangement of soldiers in close order). 
Nor should he have allowed the author's inat- 
tention to leave in the text many errors like illy 
for ill ; in petto, meaning secretly, for en petit, 
in miniature ; and, to crown all, this extraordi- 
nary statement ("Hannibal," p. 24) : "Like our 
own broncos or the Cossack horses, their little 
nags were wonderful for endurance and activity, 
and throve on food which would kill a civilized 
horse. On the other hand, they were cruel, 
reckless, and noted for plundering and rapac- 

ity." 

To offset this dispraise, we are glad to say 
that Colonel Dodge shows many good qualities 
as an author. If he sins against rhetoric, he 
is never tedious in discourse. He narrates 
well. He makes a non-military reader under- 
stand military matters, though he says there 
are some pages too technical for the general 
reader. His occasional errors of expression do 
not take from him the characteristics of a clear 
thinker. He studies the works of other authors, 
but does not follow them where his own research 
leads to different conclusions. To qualify himself 
for writing the " Hannibal " and the " Caesar," 
he visited the fields of their exploits. He claims 
that he is the only writer upon Caesar's cam- 
paigns, except Colonel Stoffel, "who has fol- 
lowed Caesar entirely around the Mediterranean 
basin." With Livy and Polybius in hand, he 
examined all the passes of the Alps and fol- 
lowed the track of the Lion of Carthage over 
all his marches and battle-fields, before he wrote 
of him. With such preparation he detects mil- 
itary and topographical errors in even the best 
histories of Rome. The " Caesar " has but few 
illustrations ; the " Alexander " has many. Of 
these many are modern, adapted from the an- 
tique, often with an added touch of the pictur- 
esque in attitude. It is necessary of ten to discard 
the conventionality of the antique, especially in 
illustrations from coins and from the Egyptian 
and the Assyrian sources. Figures on vases 
and the like were evidently drawn for artistic 
purposes rather than for exact representation. 
But we venture the surmise that some figures 
as, for instance, those of Hebrew soldiers in the 
" Alexander," pp. 19-21 are without au- 
thority.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



Colonel Dodge knows the value of maps, and 
gives them liberally ; many are mere sketchy 
diagrams, but they fully answer the purpose, 
since accuracy by a scale is not needed so much 
as a general idea of relations. He can afford 
to give these in abundance, where elaborate 
maps must be fewer ; and these are at hand in 
the text, and not on the library shelf, when 
wanted. Hence the books are wonderfully con- 
venient. Another excellence is the full digest 
of the contents of each chapter, not given in 
the form of mere catchwords, but in complete 
sentences. We quote one below. Colonel 
Dodge says they show the reader what to skip ; 
after reading every, page, we find them useful 
for review. 

Of his judgments upon Alexander, Hanni- 
bal, and Caesar, we must say that he has a very 
hearty spirit of hero-worship, and sets their 
achievements in the best lights. With respect 
to Alexander, it seems to us that he far over- 
states his case. He says: "The life-work of 
Philip had been transcendent. That of Alex- 
ander surpasses anything in history. Words 
fail to describe the attributes of this monarch 
as a soldier." Such laudation as this does sur- 
pass anything in history, and lands us in the 
realm of imagination at once. His praise of 
Philip is deserved, though probably rather 
strong ; but without the preparation of Philip 
there could have been no career of Alexander. 
He started with an immense advantage. And 
what did he do ? He fought with an enemy 
intrinsically weak and destitute of strategic 
skill. After Marathon it was not difficult to 
defeat a Persian army. Miltiades began the 
series ; Pausanias followed ; Cimon carried on 
the work ; Clearchus and Cyrus the younger 
marched with thirteen thousand soldiers and an 
auxiliary rabble into the heart of Persia, and 
the soldiers marched out again ; Agesilaus saw 
that the Corinthian War called him from pros- 
pects of vast success against the Oriental troops; 
Epaminondas could have beaten Medes and 
Sacians easier than he overcame the Spartan 
phalanxes. We may almost ask, who could n't 
beat Persia ? At least some of the ancients had 
a similar view; for they report that Alexander 
of Epirus, upon encountering the Samnites and 
Lucanians, struck with their soldierly qualities, 
said that he wished his nephew, Alexander the 
Great, had come over to Italy, where he would 
have found antagonists worth fighting with, in- 
stead of unskilful barbarians. Merivale, in his 
" General History " of Rome, raises this objec- 
tion to Alexander's fame, and thinks he would 



have failed had he started into Italy with his 
thirty thousand, and had met a Roman army, 
which would have been joined by the other Ital- 
ians. We think it is Colonel Chesney who sug- 
gests that the prestige and success of Napoleon 
was greatly enhanced by his meeting in his first 
campaign troops so inferior as the Austrians 
then were. Colonel Dodge says that the cour- 
age and discipline of the Macedonian soldier 
was much higher than that of the rest of Greece, 
" immeasurably higher than that of the soldier 
of Persia." If so, Alexander was the eagle in 
the dove-cote, and his glory is factitious to a 
great extent. He never had an effective oppo- 
sition, except at the siege of Tyre. Numbers 
without discipline these made the Persian 
armies. And what did the opposition of a few 
mountaineers like the Mardi amount to ? What 
the hosts of Porus ? 

The excessive admiration of Alexander makes 
the author unjust to other generals. He says 
no one but Alexander knew how to follow up a 
victory swiftly. But his army was never dis- 
organized by battle with the Oriental hordes, 
and his cavalry was superior in quality by his 
father's discipline. Take in contrast Caesar's 
first great battle with the Helvetians. His 
troops fought with men their superiors in num- 
bers, in impetuosity, and in motives that nerve 
men to fight ; their equals in courage and tena- 
city ; their inferiors only in advantages of posi- 
tion, in arms, in discipline, and in leadership. 
And as the Roman armies were not always well 
provided with cavalry, Caesar had only the un- 
reliable Gallic horse under Dumnorix. Re- 
membering the saying of Wellington (was it 
not?) that to an army the misfortune next to 
a great defeat is a great victory, -was it a mark 
of inferior generalship that Caesar spent three 
days before he followed up his beaten foe? 

Although the language of eulogy was well- 
nigh exhausted upon Alexander, the career 
of Hannibal elicits high praise from our au- 
thor : 

" In the galaxy of great captains the stars are equal. 
Many claim for Hannibal a lustre beyond the others. 
Measuring his task and resources by those of any sol- 
dier of history, he may be not untruthfully said to be 
primus inter pares." ("Hannibal," pp. 614). 

" Hannibal's organizing ability was unmatched. Out 
of the most ragged material he could speedily produce 
a disciplined army" (p. 626). 

" The energy, skill, intelligence and determination 
with which he carried out his plan [of movement from 
Spain to Cisalpine Gaul] would have made him one of 
the greatest leaders if he had never advanced beyond 
the Po. But this was only a first step in Hannibal's 
military career " (p. 638). 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

And in this sentence he places the crown on 
Hannibal's head : 

" Guaged by the work he had to do, the resistance 
he encountered, and the means at his command, Hanni- 
bal outranks any general of history " (p. 642). 

The " Caesar" opens with a short sketch of the 
work of Marius, a great fighter, but not a strat- 
egist ; famous as the Savior of Rome in the 
great Cimbrian War. He made his mark upon 
Roman military affairs by his new organization 
of the armies, by which he made the legions 
what they were when Caesar began to be a sol- 
dier, different from the earlier republican le- 
gions in material, in organization of cohorts, 
and in arrangements for battle. Caesar's earlier 
career, his adventure with the pirates, his serv- 
ice in the Mithridatic War, and his short ca- 
reer as praetor in Spain, are briefly sketched, 
so that by the fiftieth page the author begins 
his history of the Gallic War, which fills, with 
its explanations of military affairs, 350 pages 
none too much for its importance, both as a 
development of Caesar and as an incident in 
the world's history. Its development of Caesar 
fixed the fate of the Roman state ; as an inci- 
dent in history, it secured Italy for centuries 
from barbarian invasion, and laid the founda- 
tion of that which became France, the greatest 
of the Romance or Romanized lands. 

His campaigns are analyzed and criticised 
in detail. Colonel Dodge suggests a curious 
but unanswerable question. After giving the 
brief account of Caesar's one campaign in Spain, 
he says : 

"When he attacked the Gallic question, he showed 
that he was familiar with war, but not with the man- 
agement of its greater problems. Gaul was his school 
in the grand operations of war. It is to be regretted 
that we do not know how he had learned what unques- 
tionably he knew of the art previous to his first cam- 
paign in Gaul. He had manifestly covered an immense 
territory; but we know naught of his method" (p. 47). 

Caesar showed his great ability at once. Alex- 
ander came to command in a great campaign 
at twenty-two years of age, but he had had a 
military training, and able generals accompan- 
ied him. Hannibal was commander-in-chief at 
twenty-six, with training and aid like Alexan- 
der's. Napoleon came to the army of Italy in 
his twenty- seventh year, having had the train- 
ing of a military school, followed by full ten 
years of subordinate service and observation. 
Caesar, with slight exceptions, had been a civil- 
ian only, until he was forty years of age ; and 
then he conducted two great campaigns in a 
single year, with an army of new levies in part, 
and with fickle, uncertain auxiliaries ; and to 



succeed at all, it was necessary first to win the 
confidence of his men. Had he lacked this, his 
campaign against Ariovistus would have been 
a miserable failure. This first year is an illus- 
tration of the power of that wonderful element 
called genius, which in Caesar was more remark- 
able than in any other man in all history for its 
versatility. The variety of his abilities is the 
most wonderful thing in this " foremost man of 
all the world." It was inevitable that he should 
make mistakes ; and not a few of them came 
from that self-confidence shown in the phrase 
" Caesar and his fortunes." Colonel Dodge 
points these out as they appear in the light of 
experience. His fearful battle with the Nervii 
was like our Shiloh ; a disaster of surprise, 
because of insufficient exploration by scouts. 
His invasion of Britain was really impolitic, 
needless, and useless, and came near ending in 
ruin to Caesar. His campaign at Dyrrachium 
was ridiculously inadequate and apparently 
inexcusable, though one may say that he knew 
his opponent, Pompey, too well to fear him. 
By the way, how could General Napier write 
such a judgment of Pompey as he gave Dr. 
Arnold ? He wrote : " Tell Dr. Arnold to be- 
ware of falling into the error of Pompey being 
a bad general ; he was a very great one per- 
haps, in a purely military sense, greater than 
Caesar." Most writers agree with our author, 
whose opinion of Pompey is given on pages 
24-26, from which we quote : 

" Pompey was perhaps the lightest weight of all the 
characters who have enacted a giant's role on the stage 
of life. No [other] man won the title of Great on such 
slender merit. No [other] man ever wielded such vast 
power with so little to back it up. ... He was unable 
to plan a good campaign or assume a sudden strategic 
or tactical risk. ... In council he was slow; and to a 
habit of silence which came from a not over-quick com- 
prehension, was referred, as it often is, a judgment he 
did not profess. Pompey was but an ordmary man of 
good abilities. He had not the first glint of genius. 
Greatness was thrust upon him, if it ever was upon any 
man. He was the very reverse of Caesar. Circum- 
stances made Pompey: Csesar made circumstances. 
Pompey was cold, passionless, and slow at making reso- 
lutions." 

The whole passage is a fine sketch and summing 
up of Pompey's career and character. But we 
must leave these interesting subjects, commend- 
ing this book and the whole series (judging the 
volumes to come by those we have) to all stu- 
dents, and closing with this summary prefixed 
to chapter XIV.: 

"Alexander had the most beauty: we think of him 
as the Homeric youth; of Hannibal and Csesar as in sober 
maturity of years. In all his qualities, Ca3sar is the most 
splendid man of antiquity; as a soldier, he equals the

others. Alexander's ambition and Caesar's was coupled 
to self; Hannibal's pure. Caesar the man was kindly; 
Caesar the soldier, ruthless. In capacity for work, all 
were equal. Alexander's will was fiery; Hannibal's, 
discreet; Caesar's, calculating. In battle, Alexander was 
possessed of divine fury; Hannibal was cool but bold; 
Caesar had not their initiative. In influence over men, 
Hannibal was supreme. Caesar was an orator; Alex- 
ander and Hannibal spoke simply and to the point. As 
statesmen, Alexander built on a mistaken foundation; 
Hannibal's work was doomed to fail; Caesar's is ever- 
lasting. For performance with slender means and 
against great odds, Hannibal stands the highest. Al- 
exander had luck, but used it; Hannibal had no luck; 
Fortune smiled on Caesar as on no other man. The strat- 
egy of each was the same. In extent of conquest, Alex- 
ander was the most distinguished; in speed, Caesar; in 
endurance, Hannibal. Alexander was the cavalry- 
leader; in tactics, Caesar was below the others; in sieges, 
Hannibal. As men, Alexander and Hannibal stir us 
with the touch of nature, as Caesar does not. Caesar 
evokes our admiration; Alexander and Hannibal, our 
sympathy."

CHAPTERS or CANADIAN AND NORTH- 
WESTERN HISTORY.* 

Mr. Desire Girouard, one of the leading 
lawyers of Montreal, and a distinguished mem- 
ber of the Dominion Parliament, has hereto- 
fore greatly interested those familiar with the 
history of Canada and the Northwest by his 
publications entitled " Le Vieux Lachine et Le 
Massacre du 5 Aout, 1689 "; " Les Anciens 
Forts de Lachine et Cavelier de La Salle "; 
and " Les Anciennes Cotes du Lac Saint- 
Louis." He has now revised and enlarged 
these pamphlets, and united them, in English, 
in one book, which appropriately bears the 
names of that noble expanse of the St. Law- 
rence known as Lake St. Louis, and also of 
that dauntless explorer whose first home in the 
New World was on its shore Cavalier de La 
Salle. The consecutive narrative in which the 
three former works have been skilfully blended 
contains an instructive picture of the visits of 
the early explorers to the Island of Montreal 
and its settlement, sketched with the careful 
local touches which make it very accurate and 
real. It brings together and analyzes all of 
the known documentary evidence relating to 
La Salle's true name and to his arrival in Can- 
ada, and quite conclusively establishes both. 
In regard to La Salle's seigniory and home- 
stead at what is now Lachine, it is wonderfully 
minute and complete, and upon these subjects'

and all relating to them it must be the standard 
authority. No one but a trained lawyer famil- 
iar with the region and inspired by true his- 
torical enthusiasm could have made the old real- 
estate registers of Montreal Island so clearly 
reveal the truth as to these matters, and settle 
the long-standing controversies in regard to 
them. It was time that this work was done, 
for romantic sentiment had been busy in the 
locality, and legends of the actual existence of 
" La Salle's House " and of " the grand old 
chimney of Champlain's fur-post of 1615 " 
flourished until Mr. Girouard's pitiless demon- 
stration made an end of them. With like care, 
and masterly use of old documents and records, 
he has gone over the history of the whole island, 
and fixed the sites of its ancient forts and 
the scenes of the stirring events in its history. 
He has re-told and made very vivid the story 
of the terrible war with the Iroquois from 1689, 
the year of the frightful massacre at Lachine, 
to 1698, during which the parish burial regis- 
ters show that deaths from natural causes were 
the exception and those at savage hands the 
rule, and which " created so profound an im- 
pression that the lapse of two centuries has 
failed to obliterate it in the memory of pos- 
terity, while the dying chants of the victims 
have been handed down by tradition to find a 
place among the popular songs of the country." 

Montreal Island was for so many years the 
headquarters of all the expeditions for explor- 
ation and commerce to the West and Northwest, 
that much of its local history has associations 
with our own. From its little villages and from 
among its inhabitants went forth many of the 
hardy voyageurs who traversed our streams and 
prairies, and some of the bold soldiers who com- 
manded the frontier posts within our bounda- 
ries in the very early day. 

The lists of those whose ancestry and family 
homes Mr. Girouard has occasion to trace and 
locate contain many a name familiar in our an- 
nals. Here appear Duluth, whose name is borne 
by the ymmg metropolis of Lake Superior; 
Durantaye, who was stationed at " the fort of 
Checagou " as early as 1685 ; Boisbriant, the 
builder of Fort Chartres ; and others who 
served in the Illinois country, some of them 
with La Salle and Tonty. One especial link 
between La Salle and the West, as our author 
says, was Colonel John B. Beaubien, well re- 
membered by the old settlers of Chicago, whose 
family history is given by Mr. Girouard, and 
is an interesting one. It appears that in 1660 
a party of Frenchmen were surprised in the

vicinity of Montreal by a band of Iroquois, who 
took their captives to the village of Oneida and 
put them all to death except one, Rene Cuille- 
rier, a native of Vernon, in the diocese of An- 
ger, in France. His life was saved by an old 
squaw, who adopted him, and after nineteen 
months of captivity he escaped and returned 
to Montreal, where he married in 1665. He 
became a prominent merchant, and bought land 
at Lachine, and was its first churchwarden. 
His stone house, built there in 1713, still re- 
mains, but in a ruinous condition ; and this is 
the structure erroneously called "the home- 
stead of La Salle." Rene's grandson, Jean 
Baptiste Cuillerier, born at Lachine in 1709, 
was surnamed Beaubien from his mother's fam- 
ily, and was known as J. Bte. Cuillerier dit 
Beaubien. He completed the stone house, and 
lived first in it ; afterward he removed to De- 
troit, where in 1742 he married Marie- Anne 
Barrois, and their grandson was Colonel John 
B. Beaubien of early Chicago. The close con- 
nection between Illinois and Montreal in those 
far-off times might be repeatedly illustrated by 
other quotations from this valuable work, did 
space permit. Very interesting, too, are its de- 
scriptions of the fur-trade and its magnates, and 
of the earlier and later business and social as- 
pects of the villages along Lake St. Louis ; of 
the ancient missions and chapels ; of the visit of 
"Tom " Moore to Lachine and St. Anne; of the 
fitting out of Sir John Franklin's expedition, 
and of his Canadian companions, voyageurs 
from Lake St. Louis ; but upon these we can- 
not dwell. Suffice it to say that this book is a 
valuable contribution to our history, as well as 
to that of the neighborhood to which it specially 
relates ; and it deserves high praise. Honora- 
ble mention should also be made of the admira- 
ble translation of the original work from French 
into English by Mr. Desire H. Girouard, son 
of the author, and himself a member of the bar 

of Montreal.

COLONEL PEARSON, a friend of the late J. A. Symonds, 
has prepared " A Short History of the Renaissance in

the author's sanction, of the seven-volume work of 
Symonds. The work loses greatly, of course, by a re- 
duction to less than one-seventh of its full size, but a 
brief history of the subject should certainly be found 
useful, and could not have been made upon a better 
basis than was afforded by the original of this venture. 
" Colonel Pearson's object has been to select and ar- 
range for those who know Italy, or hope in the future 
to do so, whatever may sustain or promote an interest

RECENT STUDIES IN CURRENCY AND 
FINANCE. * 

The exceptional character of our financial expe- 
riences during recent years, and the marked revival 
of general interest in the study of monetary prob- 
lems, seem likely to leave behind them some more 
or less permanent record in the fresh crop of finan- 
cial literature that has been brought forth. All of 
these new books are professedly of popular interest, 
though some of them possess no inconsiderable de- 
gree of scientific merit. All of them, moreover, 
mark a notable and welcome step in advance of the 
currency discussions of a decade ago, in their less 
dogmatic and doctrinaire tone ; in their clearer rec- 
ognition of the importance of special forces and cir- 
cumstances in modifying the operation of general 
principles ; and, above all, in their keen appreciation 
of the manner and extent of the subtle influence 
exercised by purchasing power in the form of credit, 
in a community where banking facilities have reached 
so high a point of development as in the United 
States. 

Of all these discussions, the most noteworthy, on 
account both of its timeliness and the sound judg- 
ment and logical acumen displayed by the writer, 
is Professor Taussig's monograph on "The Silver 
Situation in the United States." It is altogether the 
most satisfactory treatment of the events and condi- 
tions bearing upon the solution of the silver ques- 
tion in this country, and is a contribution of some 
importance to certain minor points in the theory of 
money. The 135 pages of this essay are divided 
into two parts. The first part gives a clear and in- 
teresting account of the various conditions affecting 
the fluctuations in the circulation of the silver cur- 
rency since the Bland Act of 1878. The second 
part is an examination of the questions of policy 
involved in the currency controversy, and, more 
particularly, an investigation of that part of the 
bimetallist argument which reasons from the fall of 
prices to the need for more money. This is the 
least satisfactory part of the essay, and mainly so 
because the author has shrunk from the important 
but difficult task of defining what the necessary re- 
quirements of an equitable standard of value are. 
It is useless to talk about the questions of right and

wrong in the bimetallic controversy until a standard 
of right has been determined; and this is what is 
not done by Professor Taussig. 

Hardly less timely than the essay just noticed is 
Mr. Kinley's volume on the history, organization, 
and influence of " The Independent Treasury of the 
United States." Mr. Kinley seeks to make out a 
case against the present Sub-treasury system, by 
showing the pernicious and disturbing influence of 
the irregular collections and disbursements of the 
government on the money supply. The Federal 
Treasury is now the largest single manipulator of 
money in this country, and, as a result of its posi- 
tion of commanding influence, the business commu- 
nity has been reduced to a forced dependence on its 
daily policy. An element of instability is thus in- 
troduced into all business, and this is unavoidable 
under a system of treasury deposits which requires 
that the government shall be the actual custodian 
of the public money. The Sub-treasury system was 
devised to secure the safety of the public money, 
but it has done this at the cost of elasticity of the 
currency. The present problem is to secure elas- 
ticity without sacrificing safety ; and for this pur- 
pose Mr. Kinley proposes a reorganization of the 
national banking system, adding greatly to the func- 
tions of the banks as financial agents of the govern- 
ment. Such, in brief, is the burden of the writer's 
argument. In working out his position, Mr. Kin- 
ley has produced a book of decided interest, even 
for those who are unwilling to go his length in de- 
preciation of an institution which has been so pro- 
ductive of good as the Independent Treasury. The 
book, in its descriptive parts, will be found a most 
useful repository of information regarding some of 
the important influences constantly at work in our 
money market. 

Under the title of " A Brief History of Panics 
in the United States," Mr. Thorn has published an 
English version of so much of M. Juglar's well- 
known work on " Commercial Crises " as related to 
the United States. It may be well questioned whether 
this translation was worth the effort. There is cei'- 
tainly place for a good history of American crises, 
but the gap is too large to be filled by M. Juglar's 
fragmentary and superficial treatment of the sub- 
ject. The present volume tells nothing new and 
omits much that is included in other books. And 
whatever merits the work in its French form pos- 
sessed are largely diminished in the English trans- 
lation, through inaccurate renderings and not infre- 
quent misprints. 

Both teachers and readers of political economy 
in America have long felt the need of a treatise 
containing a full, but clear and simple, popular ex- 
position of the principles of money a book that 
should do much the same service for American read- 
ers as the late Stanley Jevons did for English readers 
in his admirable " Money and the Mechanism of Ex- 
change." Several attempts have been made in this 
direction, the last in the series being Mr. Tren- 



holm's " The People's Money." The judgment of the 
reading public must decide whether Mr. Trenholm 
has succeeded in producing a book that will at once 
stimulate and satisfy the interest for instruction in 
this subject. He certainly shows some excellent 
qualifications for his task, but he lacks the power 
of vivid description, of clear and simple statement, 
of making pointed analogies and concise summaries, 
all of which are so needful in popular exposi- 
tions. His literary style is, we venture to think, 
too dignified and impassive to appeal to the aver- 
age mind. Less fault may, however, be found with 
the contents of this manual. Its general trend may 
be conjectured from the imprint the upper cover 
bears of the gold double-eagle. Bimetallism is only 
incidentally discussed, but much space is given to 
the banking question. The writer is a warm friend 
of bank-currency, but he insufficiently estimates the 
extent and importance of bank-issues in the form 
of " deposits " as distinguished from notes. No cur- 
rency lesson needs to be so thoroughly taught to the 
American public at this critical juncture as that, 
not gold and silver, not greenbacks nor bank-notes, 
but credits, in the shape of bank deposits, are the 
most important constituent of our circulation that 
one upon which the general level of prices, in the 
end, depends. Occasionally Mr. Trenholm falls 
into time-honored superstition ; as when, in his zeal- 
ous argument for banks, he writes : " It is certainly 
true that the increase of bank-note issues tends to 
reduce the rate of interest on commercial loans." 
This is not only a false but a dangerous doctrine to 
teach; for, were it as true as Mr. Trenholm's lan- 
guage implies, it would go a long way toward jus- 
tifying the popular demand for more money. 

It is not unusual, in these days when the pride 
of authorship has taken hold of so many young 
minds, to meet with books for whose publication 
it is hard to discover any adequate reason. Of this 
character is Mr. Sidney Sherwood's "History and 
Theory of Money." The volume is made up of a 
number of University Extension - lectures extem- 
poraneously delivered to a popular Philadelphia 
audience, with a verbatim report of the class dis- 
cussion which followed. Whatever excuse may 
exist for the mode of education of which Mr. Sher- 
wood's book is a product, it is sincerely to be hoped 
that, if publication in the present form is an essen- 
tial ingredient of the process, some method may 
speedily be devised for sparing the reading public a 
recurrence of such shocks to its sense of literary 
propriety as come from the perusal of such a vol- 
ume as this. The author's plea for publication 
" the more scholarly education of practical men and 
the more practical education of scholars " im- 
plies a gratuitous assumption of ignorance on the 
part of both classes of readers. It would be 
painful to believe that either our " practical men " 
or our " scholars " had become reduced to the sad 
necessity of looking to such a work for either in- 
spiration or guidance. And certainly any true

friend of the University Extension movement has a 
right to complain at the use of its good name as a 
shield for such immature effort. 

In his excellent monograph on "Special Assess- 
ments," Mr. Victor Rosewater has given us an in- 
teresting, original, and adequate discussion of an 
important but hitherto neglected topic in municipal 
finance. Special assessments are a peculiarly Amer- 
ican form of taxation, being a method of defraying 
the cost of local expenditures to property, under- 
taken, to be sure, in the public interest, but inuring 
to the particular advantage of the owner. The sys- 
tem originated in New York in the seventeenth 
century, and gradually spread, until now it has been 
adopted by all but four States of the Union. Spe- 
cial assessments are everywhere regarded as an ex- 
ercise of the taxing power, but they are to be dis- 
tinguished from taxes proper. Hence the rule that 
taxation should be proportional to ability does not 
apply to special assessments ; the universally recog- 
nized principle of our law is that they must always 
be proportional to benefits received. 

Mr. William Ripley has made a very interesting 
contribution to the history of colonial finance in his 
"Financial History of Virginia." Indirect taxes, 
as in all young communities, were the principal re- 
source of the colony, and the main burden rested 
upon tobacco, the staple product of Virginia. An 
export duty was imposed on tobacco, but it is un- 
likely that it was paid by the foreign consumer; it 
amounted, in fact, to a disguised land-tax on the 
colonial grower. The other financial expedients of 
the colony were of the same primitive character, 
and were gradually rejected as sounder ideas in tax- 
ation began to prevail. 

Professor Scott's "Repudiation of State Debts" 
is a thorough discussion of one of the strangest phe- 
nomena in the history of American finance. Twelve 
of the States have, at one time or another, taken 
advantage of their quasi-sovereign rights to " scale " 
or repudiate their debts. As the law stands to-day, 
the holder of a repudiated bond has no legal means 
of enforcing the payment of the obligation. Dr. 
Scott carefully examines the acts of repudiation 
passed by the various States, and gives an analysis 
of the causes that have led to the use of so violent 
a financial expedient. Repudiation has seldom been 
resorted to except under circumstances of heavy 
financial pressure, and when the people believed 
that it had been betrayed by an unscrupulous legis- 
lature. Most of the States have tried to prevent 
the recurrence of similar abuses by limiting the 
amount of debt that may be contracted by the legis- 
lature. This is, however, a plainly unsatisfactory 
remedy ; and Dr. Scott proposes the institution of 
State courts, with power to adjudicate cases involv- 
ing the validity of bonds, and with power to issue 
writs of mandamus compelling the tax-officers to 
include in their assessments an amount sufficient to 
cover the debts adjudged valid.

Impressions of 
America. 



Prince Serge Wolkonsky, after spend- 
ing the summer at the World's Fair, 
has beat a retreat, letting fly two Par- 
thian arrows on the way. In other words, he has col- 
lected his occasional " Addresses," made during the 
summer, into one booklet, and jotted down his " Im- 
pressions" in another (Unity Publishing Co.). The 
addresses are kindly in feeling, but rhetorical and 
diffuse in style, evidently not prepared to be printed. 
They have a great deal to say about religious unity 
and the brotherhood of man, and incidentally sug- 
gest that the Midway Plaisance might have been 
made an excellent "school for teaching human 
brotherhood." Of that characteristic feature of the 
Fair he further says : " For me it is the most sad 
thing I know, because it is human life exposed as a 
show ; human beings deprived of their feelings, and 
reduced to the state of a catalogued exhibit, a mov- 
ing panorama of empty human forms." Prince 
Wolkonsky's impressions are in many chapters upon 
as many subjects. The chapter on " Politicians " 
is a gem : " Thank God, I have not known one of 
them ! " This is all, but what more need be said ? He 
has a little fun at the expense of the amiable people 
who thought that he, as a Russian, must be a nihilist, 
and that Russia was an uncivilized country. One 
interlocutor even wanted to know if the Bible had 
been translated into Russian. The same gentleman 
remarked : "I think your music is much too good 
for such a nation as yours." The urbanity of the 
reply is in charming contrast with the ill-breeding 
displayed by the remark that occasioned it. "I 
thought American music was much too bad for such 
a great nation as they are." Our impressionist de- 
fines a reception as " a social entertainment intended 
to kill all sociability by depressing and levelling all 
individuality." And he adds : " Oh, deliver us from 
those entertainments where we say to ourselves, 
' Oh, what a bore ! ' and to others, ' I am so glad to 
meet you ! ' " The impressions of " Woman" take 
the form of an imaginary interview upon the writer's 
return home. He cheerfully answers the questions 
put to him. until someone inquires about the Amer- 
ican female voice. The answer is evasive : " You 
are very little civilized if you don't know how it 
sounds. American voices are too well known all 
over Europe." That Prince Wolkonsky has read 
our newspapers to some purpose is evident from the 
passages we have selected for final quotation. " You 
will seldom find in the daily press a serious critique. 
If you have missed a lecture or a concert, you can- 
not learn from the papers of the following morning 
whether you lost or gained by not having gone; 
you will find a minute description of the lecturer's 
physique, his dress, the number of people present, 
a list of names (always the same ones, oh, not 
much variety in that, but people like to see their 
names reported, and others find a sort of painful 
delight in reading them over and over). If some

Edwin Booth, the representative tra- 
r. Winter's TAfe or e( jian o f his time, has been fortunate 

Edwin Booth. p . , . , . 

in having for his biographer a man 
thoroughly in sympathy with his art and intimately 
acquainted with his life ; consequently in Mr. Will- 
iam Winter's " Life and Art of Edwin Booth " 
(Macmillan) we have a work of high value in the 
history of dramatic art during the generation that 
is just passing away. For many years Booth stood 
at the head of his profession. Never until Mr. Irv- 
ing appeared did Booth meet with a rival. He had 
eclipsed Forrest. He had nothing to fear from 
Davenport, Brooke, Murdoch, Adams, Dillon, Mar- 
shall, Wallack, Fechter, Barrett, or McCullough. 
Not till Mr. Irving came to America did Booth ever 
have reason to understand that his star had passed 
its meridian and was beginning to descend. He did 
not believe in the new school. To the end he stood 
fast by the old-fashioned standard of poetic tragedy, 
the grand manner, the elocutionary not less than 
the mimetic art. But he recognized that there is an 
inevitable fate in such changes ; and one of the sweet- 
est of his characteristics was the gentle patience, the 
cheerful resignation, with which he accepted the new 
order of things, although he could not defer to the 
new lights of art. The chief public work of Booth's 
life was his effort to establish a great theatre, to be 
conducted in a high and liberal spirit and to be de- 
voted to all that is grand and fine in dramatic lit- 
erature and art. He built and for more than four 
years managed a theatre according to these high 
ideals. But being better as an actor than as man- 
ager and financier, his health suffered under the 
strain of care, and forced him to abandon the under- 
taking. These and other interesting incidents are 
fully detailed in Mr. Winter's Life of Booth, which 
occupies the first 150 pages of his work. Part II., 
of about the same length, is devoted to "The Art 
of Edwin Booth," and includes descriptions of all 
his leading roles, seventeen in number, mostly Shake- 
spearian. The volume concludes with a large num- 
ber of memorials, in verse and prose, offered at the 
time of his death, last June. 

There was no lack of books in the 
. field selected b ? Professor Oliver J. 

Thatcher, of the University of Chi- 
cago, for his literary labors resulting in " A Sketch 
of the History of the Apostolic Church" (Hough- 
ton), but whatever other merit his book may have 
it is probably the most readable of them all. A 
brief note of acknowledgment of assistance ren- 
dered by two of his colleagues in preparing it for 
publication is all that the book has by way of pref- 
ace. The exceedingly terse dedication, "To my 
Teacher, Prof. Adolf Harnack," supplies the defi- 



ciency, however, and suggests whence the author 
derives the materials for his treatment of his sub- 
ject. Even under such a thorough teacher our au- 
thor's study has been obviously partial, and he seems 
to infer that what is a new discovery to him must 
be new to his readers. He makes many assertions, 
therefore, with the air of one who is about to sur- 
prise his readers ; whereas there is little in the book 
that is new, unless it be some of the author's deduc- 
tions. There are cases where he is rather too free 
with the expression "no one knows," where an ad- 
mission of his own ignorance would have been suf- 
ficient. The most conspicuous purpose of the book 
appears to be to controvert all known theories of 
church polity derived from Apostolic times. The 
Apostolic Church, as Professor Thatcher is at pains 
to picture it, exists now neither in its polity nor in 
its doctrine.

silence, and adobe, that is New Mexico in three 
words. If a fourth were to be added, it need be 
only to clinch the three. It is the Great American 
Mystery the National Rip Van Winkle the 
United States which is not the United States. Here 
is the land of poco tiempo the home of 'Pretty 
soon.' " Mr. Lummis has a picturesque and vigor- 
ous style, and his account of New Mexico " the 
anomaly of the Republic," he calls it, of its mot- 
ley populace, its antiquities, its curious survivals of 
pre-Columbian rites and customs, its ancient walled 
cities, etc., is decidedly interesting. A unique chap- 
ter is devoted to " New Mexican Folk-Songs," a 
number of which are given, with the notes. The 
volume is liberally illustrated with photographic 
plates. 

The volume in whichjthe late Dr. Wil- 
helm Moeller, Professor of Church 
History in the University of Kiel, 
set forth, as viewed from his standpoint, the " His- 
tory of the Christian Church" for the first six 
centuries, was reviewed in THE DIAL for July 16. 
The second volume of the series contemplated by 
its learned author is now before us, translated from 
the German, as was the first, by Mr. Andrew Ruth- 
erfurd, B.D., and comprising an octavo volume of 
553 pages (Macmillan). It carries the narrative 
through the Middle Ages ; that is to say, from the 
beginning of the seventh to the end of the fifteenth 
century. These nine centuries are as fruitful in 
picturesque incidents and heroic characters as any, 
yet the author and translator between them have 
succeeded in divesting the narrative of every parti- 
cle of the picturesque, and in reducing it to the 
driest possible recital of events. That the details of 
history are conscientiously set forth we doubt not

is complete. The book is, therefore, invaluable for 
reference and as a historical directory. But the 
typography is of a very complex character, and 
reading is thereby made exceedingly laborious. 
Even in a theological school, the book could not be 
used as a text-book except at the risk of disgusting 
the students with this very important branch of 
theological culture. 

A very pleasing relic of our Puritan 
forefathers is the volume called 
" Some Old Puritan Love-Letters " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.). They comprise a portion of 
the correspondence (fifty-eight letters) between John 
Winthrop, first Governor of Massachusetts, and his 
wife, Margaret Tyndal Winthrop, between the years 
1618 and 1653. These letters are far from being 
models of the epistolary art ; they are barren of lit- 
erary reference and almost entirely lacking in men- 
tion of contemporary events ; their charm (and it is 
not slight) is in their antique flavor and in their ten- 
der yet formal tone, in such marked contrast with 
the more familiar manner of the letter-writing of 
the present. Another characteristic of the time ap- 
pears in their devout and religious atmosphere. The 
Governor addresses his wife in phrases like this : 
" I salute thee hearty lye, giving thanks to God who 
bestowed thee upon me and hath continued thee unto 
me," etc. Nor is the wife less piously minded : "My 
good husban, I thanke you for putinge me in minde 
to be cheerful, and to put my trust in my good God 
who hath never fayled me in time of nede. I be- 
seech him to continue his mercy still to me and grant 
that my sinnes may not provoke his anger against 
me." This quaint and unstudied correspondence is 
a delightful means of coming close to the domestic 
life of our New England ancestors. 

A glance through the pages of Dr. 

Summer rambles A jj_ Japp's " Hours ill My Gar- 

in the country. / -n \ i -.u 

den (Macmillan) leaves one with 
an agreeable and at this season highly illusory 
impression of having enjoyed a summer ramble in 
the country. The little volume is made up of nine- 
teen "Nature Sketches," largely the fruit of per- 
sonal observation, and it is well freighted with the 
lighter lore of the woods and fields, ponds and 
streams, hedgerows and coppices of Old England. 
The style of the book recalls Richard Jefferies, but 
there is more literary allusion, and the author has 
evidently looked at nature through spectacles more 
scientific than poetical. The little essays are pleas- 
antly written, and are well adapted to stimulate 
young readers to a systematic study of Nature. 
The one hundred and thirty-eight woodcuts are 
nicely done, and add to the educative value of the 
text. .

Jefferson ( Putnam) covers the years 
1776-1781, years of activity in resisting the efforts 
of Great Britain to subdue the rebellious Colonies, 



during which Jefferson displayed those qualities of 
statesmanship which won the confidence of Wash- 
ington and secured for him the office of Secretary 
of State in the new government. Whether as mem- 
ber of Congress or of the Virginia Assembly, or as 
Governor of that Commonwealth, he strengthened 
the Colonial cause and liberalized the government. 
The correspondence and papers in this volume show 
how thoroughly Jefferson gave himself to his coun- 
try during this trying period. Of course the most 
interesting of the contents of this volume a docu- 
ment in itself of sufficient importance to secure im- 
mortality to any man is the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. Mr. Ford has given in parallel columns 
the first draft from the copy in the writing of John 
Adams, the draft reported by the committee which 
is taken from Jefferson's rough draft reproduced 
here in fac-simile from the original in the Depart- 
ment of State, and the engrossed copy. The useful 
Itinerary and Chronology begun in the first volume 
is continued in the second. 



A belated holiday publication, and 

A new version i /-^ 

of George Sand's one of unusual merit, is George 
Sand's "Fadette" (the original of 
" Fanchon the Cricket"), translated by Miss Jane 
Minot Sedgwick, and published by Messrs. George 
H. Richmond & Co. of New York. An etched 
frontispiece by E. Abot, printed in Paris, hand- 
made paper with rough edges, careful press- work, 
and a novel binding of gray paper boards and 
muslin joints, give finish and symmetry to the 
dainty volume, which must appeal alike to the ad- 
mirers of George Sand and the lovers of handsome 
books. Fortunately for the little volume, its sale 
does not depend upon the holiday trade, and it will 
doubtless find its way into the possession of collec- 
tors until the limited issue is exhausted. We should 
add that the "brief, rich, melancholy sentences" 
of George Sand, as rendered into English by Miss 
Sedgwick, have not a little of the charm which their 
originals had for Thackeray, to whom they seemed 
" like the sound of country bells, provoking I don't 
know what vein of music and meditation, and fall- 
ing sweetly and sadly on the ear."

popular way, from the standpoint of both the spec- 
tator and the player. The book is evidently in- 
tended chiefly for beginners ; though in parts nota- 
bly in the chapters on foot-ball and base-ball the 
writer has gone more into detail on the points of 
science and skill, and has thus made the book val- 
uable to advanced students of these games. The 
schoolboy will find in it much useful information

as well as explanations on points of skill. The

succeeds in doing in a very interesting manner. 



An amusing col- 
lection of Bulls 
and Blunders. 



The drift of Mr. Marshall Brown's 
collection of " Bulls and Blunders " 
(Griggs) is sufficiently indicated in 
the title. The contents of the book are drawn from 
many sources, and it is not without educative value 
in that the " blunders " quoted are largely solecisms 
arising from loose syntax. The " bulls," as may be 
expected, are chiefly furnished by the cheerful sons 
of Hibernia who, whatever their failings, have 
certainly contributed freely to the gayety of nations. 
We subjoin a specimen of tribunal eloquence quoted 
from M. Taine's " French Revolution ": "I would," 
roared an orator in one of the sections, "take my 
own head by the hair, cut it off, and, presenting it 
to the despot, would say to him, ' Tyrant, behold 
the act of a free man ! ' ' This is almost as good as 
Sir Boyle Roche's plaint : " The progress of the 
times, Mr. Speaker, is such that little children who 
can neither walk nor talk may be seen running 
about the streets cursing their Maker." 



Pictures of an Whether in prose or verse, Mr. 
Old Town in Thomas Bailey Aldrich is always a 

charming writer. His "Old Town 
by the Sea," which forms the subject of his latest 
volume in prose (Houghton), is of course Ports- 
mouth, which, under the name of "Rivermouth," 
has become so familiar to us through his stories, and 
was his boyhood's home. In this volume Mr. Aid- 
rich has collected the history, traditions, and descrip- 
tion of the old New Hampshire town, from its first 
settlement in 1623 until the present. In themselves 
these stories and events are no more picturesque or 
fascinating than those of the average New England 
town; but for the same reason that the "Bad Boy" 
won our love and admiration when his deeds were 
related by the sinner himself, so these trifles become 
delightful through the magic touch of their historian 
and lover. 

The characters in Shakespeare's plays 
never cease to furnish attractive lit- 
erary themes. "The Trial of Sir 
John Falstaff," by Mr. A. M. F. Randolph, has for 
its second title " Wherein the fat knight is permitted 
to answer for himself concerning the charges laid 
against him, and to attorney his own case." The 
author, evidently a lawyer, makes skilful citations 
from the Falstaffian portions of the Shakespeare 
text and strings them together adroitly. Various 
other matters, not strictly collateral, are introduced, 
such as speculations on Shakespeare's life, criti- 
cal comments on his genius, an amusing thrust at Mr. 
Donnelly's cryptogram, etc. As a whole, however, 
the book, although ingenious and entertaining, is not 
to be taken very seriously. ( Putnam. )

Translations from 

Scandinavian 

Literature. 



Those who take up "Elsie: A Christ- 
mas Story " with the expectation of 
being cheered thereby will be griev- 
ously disappointed. It is a tale translated from the 
Norwegian of Herr Kjelland by Mr. M. M. Dawson 
(Kerr), and, we regret to say, not well translated. 
It gives us a grim picture of the social contrasts of 
society, and satirizes the Pharisee with a fierceness 
that suggests Dr. Ibsen. Another Norwegian con- 
tribution to our book-shelves is an excellent transla- 
tion, by Mr. William Wilson, of Herr Bjornson's 
"Over uEvne," which becomes "Pastor Sang" in 
English (Longmans). The play belongs to the au- 
thor's later, and, we think, decadent period, and is 
quite as perplexing as the " Bygmester Solness " of 
his famous contemporary. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Volume Three of Green's " A Short History of the En- 
glish People," in the superb illustrated edition edited by 
Mrs. Green and Miss Norgate (Harper), brings us within 
one volume of the complete work. As in the two pre- 
ceding instalments, the illustrations of this volume are 
very numerous and exceptionally well selected. A fold- 
ing frontispiece gives us, in colors, London Bridge as it 
appeared circa 1600. " Puritan England " and " The 
Revolution " are the two chapters comprised within this 
volume. 

Mr. Charles A. Platt's " Italian Gardens " (Harper) 
is a belated holiday book, and one of the most beautiful 
of the season. Some score of the most famous Italian 
villas are described as to their surroundings, and illus- 
trated by a series of exquisite engravings. We have, 
among others, the Villa Borghese and the Villa Medici, 
the Quirinal and Colonna gardens, the Villa d'Este at 
Tivoli, and the Giusti gardens at Verona. The text of 
the book is interesting, but distinctly subordinate to the 
illustrations. 

Mr. George W. Hale, whose " Police and Prison Cy- 
clopsedia" we noticed favorably in its first edition, a 
year ago, now offers the work to the public in an en- 
larged and improved form (Houghton). Many reports 
received since the earlier issue have been incorporated 
within the work, and its summary of police regulations 
and criminal statistics cannot fail to be found useful by 
all interested in penology or concerned with the admin- 
istration of criminal law in our cities. There is a bio- 
graphical sketch of the author, which is distinctly read- 
able, and there are numerous portrait illustrations. 

Mr. Alexander Black's " Photography Indoors and 
Out " (Houghton) is one of the best of the manuals for 
amateurs that the new hobby has called forth. It is 
historical, descriptive, and technical enough for actual 
guidance. It gives a selection of useful tables and 
formulae, and abounds in practical hints about most of 
the phases of amateur photographic work. It is, of 
course, illustrated. Taken as a whole, we do not know 
of a better book for the purposes of the beginner. 

"Greece in the Age of Pericles" (Scribner), by Mr. 
Arthur J. Grant, is a small book of the University Ex- 
tension sort, which compactly and somewhat drily cov- 
ers the important period of history with which it is 
concerned. The writer has sought " to omit none of 



1894.]

the main forces that helped to mould Greek civiliza- 
tion," to give " prominence to the social and religious 
conditions of the country," and " to treat of Greek his- 
tory in relation to the general history of Europe." 
There are maps and other illustrations. 

"Jonathan Wild," the fourth of Fielding's novels, 
both in point of size and popularity, forms the tenth 
volume in the Dent edition of Fielding (Macmillan). 
Mr. SaiKtsbury's introduction is, of course, interesting 
reading, and all the more so because he confesses to a 
special predilection for the work in question. To it he 
has " gone for rest and refreshment " for thirty years 
past, and now would fain induce others to do likewise. 
That " Fielding has written no greater book " is a ver- 
dict from which many will dissent, but Mr. Saintsbury 
has excellent reasons for the opinion, and makes no hes- 
itation of sharing them with the public. 

Miss Burney's " Cecilia," in three volumes (Macmil- 
lan), with the Dent imprint, may now be had as a com- 
panion to the " Evelina " published nearly a year ago. 
It has for illustrations the photogravures familiar to 
readers of the Dent editions, three to a volume. Miss 
Mitford's " Our Village " (Webster) is a dainty one- 
volume reprint that many readers will find acceptable. 
A new edition of Mr. J. Rendel Harris's " Memoranda 
Sacra " (Randolph) will appeal to the pious-minded, 
and particularly to those with whom religious medita- 
tion has a mystical cast. 



YORK TOPICS. 

New York, January 9, 1894. 

The author of " Dodo," Mr. E. F. Benson, has re- 
cently been taking a trip through the Continent. He 
has just written a letter to a friend in this country, deal- 
ing with the apparent publication here of two author- 
ized editions of his well-known novel. The letter is 
dated December 19, at Athens, Greece, and in it he 
says : " I published this year in England a novel called 
' Dodo,' but as it was not published in America I lost 
copyright there. A few months later Messrs. D. Ap- 
pleton & Company offered me terms for publication in 
America, which I accepted." Mr. Benson then goes 
on to say that he afterward received a proposition 
from another American publisher, which, naturally, he 
declined. He complains that the second publisher pro- 
ceeded with his edition, and copyrighted it under his 
own name, although the book itself was not entitled to 
American copyright. Mr. Benson thinks that this was 
made possible by the substitution of intentional mis- 
prints in the text. In conclusion he writes: "I should 
like to state directly that the edition published by 
Messrs. Appleton & Company is the authorized edition, 
and that the other edition has been issued contrary to 
and in spite of my expressed wishes." Mr. Benson's 
letter seems to raise an important point in the copyright 
question, namely: whether or not copyright can be se- 
cured in an uncopyrighted book by an unauthorized per- 
son through changes in the text of the book. 

The publication of the late Herman Melville's works, 
which was carried on for a short time through an" ar- 
rangement with the United States Book Company by 
another firm, has now been resumed by one of the co- 
ordinate firms which make up the Book Company. It 
has been a great satisfaction to all concerned in the re- 
issue of Melville's works to observe the fresh interest 
which the public has taken in them. They have sold 



well, and copyright returns have accrued to Mr. Mel- 
ville's family. An interesting feature connected with 
their publication is that when editions of the American 
sheets of " Typee " and Omoo " were placed on the 
English market by the London branch of a New York 
house, it was found that the former London publisher 
of " Typee " and " Omoo," having purchased the copy- 
right of those books outright from Mr. Melville for a 
comparatively small sum, still held the English rights. 
He allowed the small American edition imported to be 
sold, but declined to permit any further importations, 
on the ground that the American edition was no im- 
provement on his own. This English publisher has 
now reprinted these books from the plates made many 
years ago, inserting some illustrations of South Sea life 
and scenery, and is meeting with a good deal of criti- 
cism for doing so, one paper saying: " We regret to add 
they [the books] have been printed from very old and 
worn plates." As Mr. Melville's family is paid a roy- 
alty on all copies sold by the United States Book 
Company, and as these English plates were in such a 
battered condition, it seems a pity that the English pub- 
lisher could not have assented to some equitable ar- 
rangement in the matter. 

The new editions of volumes by members of the En- 
glish pre-Raphaelite group are gradually appearing. I 
have been especially interested in the new and enlarged 
edition of " Goblin Market," by Miss Christina G. Ros- 
setti, with illustrations by Laurence Housman. The large 
paper copies are very attractively gotten up. Mr. Hous- 
man has, in his designs, followed the theme set by Dante 
Rossetti in the two illustrations made for the first edi- 
tion of the book. Another volume by Miss Rossetti, 
also published by Messrs. Macmillan & Company, is 
"Sing Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book," with over one 
hundred illustrations by Arthur Hughes, one of the 
younger members of the pre-Raphaelite group. Unless 
I am mistaken, this is a compilation of several smaller 
volumes written and illustrated by Miss Rossetti and 
Mr. Hughes. It is well to have all the latter's designs 
under one cover. 

Mr. Robert Bridges who is thought by some author- 
ities to be the leading minor poet of England at first 
published his verse only in limited privately-printed edi- 
tions. These very esthetic-looking volumes were issued 
from the press of H. Daniel, of Oxford. The first of 
them, called simply " Poems," was published, and pur- 
chased by a few Americans, at six shillings. Copies are 
now held by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons and by 
William Evarts Benjamin, of this city, at $25.00. An- 
other volume, "The Feast of Bacchus," published in 
1889, is now held by the same booksellers at $35.00. 
" The Growth of Love," issued in 1890, is now quoted 
at $20.00. More recently Mr. Bridges seems to have 
overcome his objection to publishing in the regular way, 
as the issuing of his " Humors of the Court : A Com- 
edy, and Other Poems," by Messrs. Macmillan, would 
indicate. Of the limited editions just mentioned, from 
a hundred to a hundred and fifty copies only were 
printed. 

It is said that Mr. Edward Fuller, author of " The 
Complaining Millions of Men," a novel in which some 
prominent Bostonians are introduced as characters un- 
der faintly disguised names, has a new work of fiction 
in hand. 

J. S. Van der Poorsen Schwarz, otherwise "Maarten 
Maartens," has prefixed to his new novel, " The Greater 
Glory; a Story of High Life," which Messrs. Appleton & 



60 



[Jan. 16, 



Co. are just about to publish, the following emphatic Note : 
" Holland is a small country, and it is difficult to step 
out in it without treading on somebody's toes. I there- 
fore wish to declare, once for all, and most emphatically, 
that my books contain no allusions, covert or overt, to 
any real persons, living or dead. I am aware that great 
masters of fiction have thought fit to work from models ; 
that method must therefore possess its advantages: it is 
not mine. ... I describe manners and morals, not 
individual men." The appearance of " God's Fool" by 
" Maarteu Maartens " led many people to believe that a 
new " master of fiction " had arisen in the Dutch " sen- 
sitivist." The present work is likely to provoke con- 
siderable discussion. There is a mystical " argument " 
or parable at the opening of the book, which is a scorch- 
ing arraignment of the life depicted in the novel. Mr. 
Schwarz, as is now pretty generally known, is a Dutch 
country gentleman, with a home at Neerlangbrock, Hol- 
land; but he has adopted England, writes in English, 
and spends much time in London, where the Authors' 
Society gave him a large dinner last year.

JjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

Messrs. Lee & Shepard announce " The Political 
Economy of Natural Law," by Mr. Henry Wood. 

The announcement is made by the family that a full 
and authorized memoir of the late Francis Parkman 
will be prepared as soon as circumstances permit. 

" To-day," a monthly magazine in the interests of the 
Universalist Church, makes its bow to the public this 
month with a mmber of forty-eight pages, containing 
articles by Senator Lodge, Professor Orello Cone, and 
others. 

The Biblia Publishing Co. announces an edition of the 
" Book of the Dead," reproducing by photographic pro- 
cess the plates published in Lepsius and Rouge*. The 
price of the work to subscribers will be $3.50. After 
publication the price will be materially raised. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons announce: a "Chess 
Pocket Manual," by Mr. C. H. D. Gossip; "Men, Wo- 
men, and Books," by Mr. Augustine Birrell; " The Phil- 
osophy of Reality," by Dr. James McCosh; "Psychol- 
ogy, Descriptive and Explanatory," by Professor George 
T. Ladd ; and Mr. R. E. Prothero's " Life and Corre- 
spondence of Dean Stanley." 

" The Magazine of Poetry " becomes, with its .January 
issue, a monthly. This issue is devoted to the Poets of 
Buffalo, among whom figure Bishop Coxe, Mrs. Rohlfs, 
Miss Amanda T. Jones (whom we have always reckoned 
among Chicago poets), Dr. Frederick Peterson, and Pro- 
fessor Henry A. Beers. The rest, numbering about two 
score, are unknown to other than local fame. 

We make this amusing extract from the printed pro- 
ceedings of the Association of American Authors: "A 
stirring letter from Col. Richard Henry Savage was read 
in reference to a most uncalled-for and unjust criticism 
upon one of his late novels. His just indignation was 
warranted by the criticism, and the letter was placed on 
file to swell the volume of authors' grievances." 

According to the Bayreuth " Taschen-Kalender," the 
number of performances of Wagner's works in the Ger- 
man language amounted in the year ending June last to 
1,047, an increase of 227 on the previous year. The 
later music dramas are now rapidly growing in favor, 



the representations of " Das Rheingold," " Siegfried," 
and " Gotterdammerung " having nearly doubled. 

"The Psychological Review," to be published bi- 
monthly by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., has just issued its 
first part. The contents include President G. T. Ladd's 
address of last December before the American Psycho- 
logical Association; a study of John Bunyan, from the 
pathological standpoint, by Professor Royce; a group 
of studies from the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, 
mainly by Professor Miinsterberg, and a number of brief 
contributions, discussions, and reviews. It is evident 
that experimental psychology is to have much of the 
attention of this Review, although the editorial forces 
include several men who will doubtless see to it that the 
laboratory psychologists do not have things entirely their 
own way. The periodical is handsomely printed, and 
presents a dignified appearance. 

The Winter Convocation of the University of Chicago 
was signalized by the dedication of the Kent Chemical 
Laboratory, and an address by Professor Ira Remsen, 
of the Johns Hopkins University. The Laboratory, which 
is one of the most beautiful of the University buildings, 
was the gift of Mr. Sidney A. Kent, of Chicago, and was 
erected and equipped by him at a cost of $235,000. In 
his address on the present condition of the University, 
President Harper reported an enrolment of 773 students, 
an increase over last year of twenty-five per cent. The 
President also took occasion to state that the University 
had no connection with a student periodical recently 
issued under circumstances calculated to mislead the 
public, and to add that the University has never had the 
slightest intention of publishing a literary magazine of 
any sort. The report, based upon a fabrication of one 
of the Chicago newspapers, that such a step was contem- 
plated, has received wide circulation and credence, and 
has proved very mortifying to the University authorities. 
Among the new appointments announced by the Pres- 
ident, we note with peculiar satisfaction that of Mr. S. 
W. Burnham to a professorship of practical astronomy. 

The Very Rev. Charles Merivale, Dean of Ely, died 
on the twenty-seventh of last month, at the age of eighty- 
five. He was educated at Harrow, Haileybury, and 
Cambridge, and was a preacher and lecturer at the Uni- 
versity of Cambridge at various periods between 1838 
and 1865. From 1848 to 1869 he was rector of Law- 
ford, Essex, becoming Dean of Ely in J869. His " His- 
tory of the Romans under the Empire " was written 
during his Lawford period, and the volumes, seven in 
number, appeared at intervals from 1850 to 1862. In 
1869 h published a rhymed translation of the "Iliad." 
Other published works include the Boyle lectures of 
1864 and 1865, entitled "The Conversion of the Roman 
Empire " and " The Conversion of the Northern Na- 
tions"; a "General History of Rome" (1865); "The 
Roman Triumvirates " (1876) ; " Lectures on Early 
Church History" (1879); and "The Contrast Between 
Pagan and Christian Society" (1880). His great work 
was, of course, the " History of the Romans under the 
Empire," which exactly fits into the gap between Momm- 
sen and Gibbon, and which is one of the best-written and 
most picturesque historical works in the English lan- 
guage. 

Mr. Harold Frederic includes these notes on Jokai 
and Heine in a recent letter from Europe : " It is im- 
possible not to contrast the imperial honors being show- 
ered from Vienna and all Hungary on Moritz Jokai, 
who was a revolutionist in 1848, and a banished exile a 
long time after, with the cold neglect and even the hos-

tility which official Germany still shows the memory of 
Heinrich Heine. The Hungarian author, during all the 
fifty years of writing, the completion of which was cel- 
ebrated to-day, never produced anything to stand for a 
moment in the world's balance with the best of Heine's 
works. Yet only a few years ago the Berlin police, in- 
heriting the stupid Prussian traditions of 1848, confis- 
cated a whole new edition of his books, and still more 
recently the municipal authorities of Heine's native 
Dusseldorf declined to allow a statue of its most famous 
son to be erected in the town. To avenge this, a Dus- 
seldorfer, who is an official in the service of the Congo 
State, writes home that he has erected a stone monu- 
ment to Heine in the wilds of Central Africa, with a 
poetic inscription saying that the savages of Ethiopia 
are more tolerant than the citizens of the Rhenish seat 
of the Arb." 

A case to which we referred some time ago has come 
up again iu the French courts, on appeal, and the judg- 
ment formerly rendered has been confirmed in principle. 
The original suit was brought by the Comte de Sesmai- 
sons, formerly French minister to Hayti, against the 
Paris branch of the publishing house of Brentano, for 
damages for the sale of a New York newspaper which 
contained an article which the plaintiff alleged to be 
libellous. The court condemned Messrs. Brentano to pay 
a fine of 100 francs and 5,000 francs costs. This is the 
first case of the kind that has come up, and the decision 
seems to be in plain accordance with article 42 of the 
law on the press, which allows the prosecution of simple 
vendors " in default " of managers, authors, or printers. 
The court held that the proprietors, publisher, and editor 
of the New York paper, being foreigners, were out of 
the reach of French law, and that, therefore, Messrs. 
Brentano were amenable. Any foreign booksellers in 
Paris, therefore, may be prosecuted if they have in stock 
any book, pamphlet, or newspaper which contains any- 
thing libellous against any Frenchman named therein. 
The only satisfaction obtained from the appeal was a 
reduction of the costs to a nominal sum. 



BURNS 8 BIRTHDAY. 

In celebration of the approaching anniversary of the 
birth of Burns (January 25), a true Scotch lover of the 
poet inscribes the following lines " To a brother Scot on 
Burns's Birthday": 

Ho ! this is Robin's natal day, 
Tae you, guid frien', I needna say; 
Tae some lane nenk let's e'en away, 
An' pay our luve tae Robin. 

Fu' mony a willie-waught thegither

In praise and sang o' Robin.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 1894. 



THE DIAL-ITS WORK AND INFLUENCE. 



A guide and aid in In the flood of books pouring from 
Current Literature. t ne p re ss, there is so much to choose 
from that no person can, unaided, judge what is to be 
read and what left unread. Hence a journal that may 
be steadily relied upon as a safe and agreeable guide to 
the character, the contents, the merits and demerits of 
the important new books, is obviously of the greatest 
value to anyone of literary inclination or pursuits, and 
ought to be upon the table of every individual and fam- 
ily possessing or desiring literary culture. Such a 
journal THE DIAL has long been known to be. Estab- 
lished for fourteen years, it is approved by high author- 
ities as "The leading literary journal of America." 
In its pages all books are described and discussed upon 
their merits, and without fear or favor. Some knowl- 
edge of the literature of the time is indispensable to all 
enlightened people, and there is no medium through 
which such knowledge may be better gained, and literary 
tastes be more easily acquired and gratified. 

Literary affairs THE DIAL has a very definite aim 

in general. and scope, though by no means a 

narrow one. By concerning itself not with Books alone 
but with Literature in the largest sense, following the 
best models of the older countries in which the pros- 
perity and standing of journals of its type measure the 
current civilization, it makes itself distinctive in Amer- 
ica. It is preeminently " A Journal of Literary Criti- 
cism, Discussion, and Information." In addition to its 
treatment of Books, it discusses literary movements and 
tendencies, gives information about literary people and 
events, and includes whatever pertains to literary affairs 
and related subjects of higher intellectual concern. 

Literature Foremost among such subjects is Ed- 

and Education. ucation, especially in its relations to 

literary culture. Believing that the study of literature, 
and the formation and encouragement of literary tastes, 
are of prime importance in education, THE DIAL will 

Published on the 1st and 16th of each month, at 



publish during 1894 (beginning with an early number) 
a series of articles and communications on the Teaching 
of English at American Colleges and Universities, writ- 
ten by Professors at these institutions, and giving an ac- 
count of the practical work done and the advantages 
and disadvantages of particular methods and courses of 
study. These articles and reports will from time to time 
be analyzed and summarized in careful editorial articles, 
with appropriate comment. It is intended that this im- 
portant series shall be followed by a similar one treat- 
ing of Literature in Schools. The interest and value of 
these articles will be apparent to everyone connected 
with school and college work. 

National Influence THE DIAL is not a local or sectional 
and Circulation. journal. Its Contributors are from 
every part of the country, including, in one class, Pres- 
idents or Professors of over thirty American colleges 
and universities, from Yale and Harvard on the Atlantic 
Coast to Stanford on the Pacific. The full list of Con- 
tributors, printed elsewhere in this issue, shows the 
names of many distinguished writers and specialists in 
various branches, and illustrates how comprehensive and 
catholic are the aims and conduct of the paper. Dur- 
ing 1893 the first complete year since it became a 
semi-monthly with enlarged scope and character its 
progress was such as to mark a distinct epoch in its 
history. The circulation has rapidly increased, and its 
geographical distribution shows the national character 
and influence attained by the journal. While the great 
West and Northwest are most prominently represented, 
its constituency embraces many names in every State and 
Territory of the Union. As an illustration of this geo- 
graphical distribution, it may be mentioned that the new 
subscriptions (76) recently received in a single day came 
from twenty-four States. Encouraged by the success of 
1893, the conductors of THE DIAL intend that 1894 
shall witness even greater gains and progress.

THE ROMANCE OF AN EMPRESS. 

Catharine II. of Russia. By K. WALISZEWSKI. With Por- 
trait. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

" Few stories in history are more romantic than that of Catharine 
II. of Russia, with its mysterious incidents and thrilling episodes ; few 
characters present more curious problems. . . . This volume, in which 
the Empress is the grand central figure, gives striking pictures of the 
condition of the contemporary Russia which she did so much to mold 
as well as to expand. . . . Indeed, with her vices, and with all her 
faults, as M. Waliszewski has sketched her portrait, we can hardly 
help liking as well as admiring her." London Times. 

THE BRONTES IN IRELAND. 

By Dr. WILLIAM WRIGHT. With Portraits and numerous 
Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"Dr. Wright has faithfully traced the current of Bronte life and 
thought back to the hidden sources. The biography has some sur- 
prises in store for the reader. It is fully illustrated, and presents a 
varied and romantic tale without a touch of the commonplace." Phil- 
adelphia Ledger. 

"One of the most curious pages which have lately been added to 
literary history." Boston Traveller. 

" A new and thrilling chapter in the history of the Bronte sisters." 
Boston Advertiser. 

GENERAL SCOTT. 

By General MARCUS J. WRIGHT. A new volume in the Great 
Commanders Series, edited by General JAMES GRANT WIL- 
SON. With Portrait and Maps. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 
General Wright's book is a work of popular interest. The 
subject is one of the most picturesque and impressive to be 
found in our military history, and the author, in availing him- 
self of the latest authorities, has produced a book which seems 
likely to be accepted as a standard work in its class. 

DARWINIANA. 

By THOMAS H. HUXLEY, author of " Physiography," "Man- 
ual of the Anatomy of Invertebrated Animals," etc. The 
second volume of the author's Collected Essays. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.25. 

These essays, ten in number, treat of evolution and the 
criticisms which followed the publication of " The Origin of 
Species," and endeavor to sum up Mr. Darwin's work and 
indicate its enduring influence on the course of scientific 
thought. 

SCIENCE AND EDUCATION. 

By THOMAS H. HUXLEY. The third volume of the author's 

Collected Essays. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
The subjects comprised in this volume include : " Technical 
Education," "Medical Education," "The School Boards," 
"Science and Culture," "Universities: Actual and Ideal," 
" Emancipation: Black and White," "A Liberal Education 
and'where to Find it," and several other allied topics. 



THE STORY OF THE SUN. 

By Sir ROBERT S. BALL, F.R.S., author of "An Atlas of 
Astronomy," " The Cause of an Ice Age," etc. 8vo, cloth, 
$5.00. 

Professor Ball's entertaining style is known to so large a 
number of readers of his popular astronomical works that this 
volume, which brings together the results of all the latest in- 
vestigations concerning the sun, will find a ready welcome. 

HOW TO STUDY AND TEACH HISTORY, 

With Particular Reference to the History of the United States. 
By B. A. HINSDALE, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of the Sci- 
ence and the Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan, 
author of "Schools and Studies," etc. Vol. 25, Interna- 
tional Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The aim of this book is practical, and it was written with 
particular reference to the needs of elementary and secondary 
teachers, although it will be found of interest and value to 
teachers and students of all grades. It is one of the most im- 
portant and valuable volumes in the series. 

THE GREATER GLORY. 

A Story of High Life. By MAARTEN HAARTENS, author of 

" God's Fool," " Joost Avelingh," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.

" Maarten Maartens is a great novelist and a remarkable man. . . . 
Few books since the best days of Dickens and Thackeray contain such 
quiet humor and depict human nature with such an unerring touch." 
Cleveland World. 

" Maarten Maartens has secured a firm footing in the eddies of cur- 
rent literature. . . . Pathos deepens into tragedy in the thrilling 
story of ' God's Fool.' " Philadelphia Ledger.

A FRIEND OF THE QUEEN. 

By PAUL GAULOT. With 2 Portraits. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

" M. Gaulot deserves thanks for presenting the personal history of 
Count Fersen in a manner so evidently candid and unbiased." Phila- 
delphia Bulletin. 

" There are some characters in history of whom we never seem to 
grow tired. Of no one is this so much the case as of the beautiful 
Marie Antoinette, and of that life which is at once so eventful and so 
tragic. ... In this work we have much that up to the present time 
has been only vaguely known." Philadelphia Press.

THE PROTECTION OF IGNORANCE. 

Whatever one's attitude may be towards the 
economic policy of protection, it will hardly 
be claimed that ignorance is among the na- 
tional industries that tariff legislation should 
seek to shelter. Yet any legislation that places 
obstacles in the way of our communication with 
the thought of other countries must be con- 
strued as imposing a tax upon enlightenment, 
and as tending to put ignorance at a premium. 
Actuated by a profound conviction that the 
logic of this position is unassailable, THE DIAL 
has sought (with a measure of success yet to 
be fully determined) to enlist the services of 
the friends of culture, irrespective of party, in 
an effort to secure the removal from our tariff 
laws of the duty upon books printed in the En- 
glish language. The response to our appeal 
has been very gratifying, and a large number 
of the blank petitions distributed by us have 
been filled with signatures, and presented by 
different members of Congress to the House of 
Representatives. The work would have been 
undertaken more systematically, and at an 
earlier date, had we not taken for granted that 
the removal of this obnoxious duty would be 
one of the first things provided for in any in- 
telligent revision of the tariff. 

It would be difficult to devise a more stupid 
duty than this tax of twenty-five per cent upon 
the implements indispensable to the profession 
of the intellectual worker. As a means of pro- 
ducing revenue, its results are insignificant. 
And a very little examination will serve to 
show that it does not, that it cannot, operate as 
a protective measure. The man who wants a 
pocket-knife, or a watch, or a suit of clothes, 
will take the article of American manufacture 
if a protective tax makes the corresponding ar- 
ticles of foreign manufacture too costly for his 
means. But the man who wants the poems of 
Tennyson, or the essays of Matthew Arnold, 
or the political writings of Professor Bryce, 
finds no corresponding American books that 
will do about as well. His purpose will not be 
suited by the poems of Longfellow, or the es- 
says of Emerson, or the political writings of 
Professor Fiske. The suggestion that, as a 
good American, he ought to be contented with 
the latter works is too puerile to be taken seri-

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



ously. A man wants a book for some specific 
purpose, and no other book will do. If he can- 
not afford to purchase it, he must go without. 
And his disgust with the law that wantonly 
places the book beyond his reach will not help 
to make him a better American. It must be 
added, lest some of our readers should have for- 
gotten the fact, that the case of English books 
copyrighted in this country is covered by the 
Copyright Law itself, which requires their man- 
ufacture here, and does not merely tax, but pro- 
hibits, the importation of the English edition. 
The amount of the tax by no means meas- 
ures the annoyance that it occasions the pur- 
chaser. If he gets an English book from the 
bookseller, he finds that the tax has in some 
mysterious way become doubled, trebled, or 
even quadrupled (after the fashion of all indi- 
rect taxes) when he comes to pay it. The av- 
erage English book published at one pound is 
sold to the trade for about fourteen shillings, 
and upon this sum the duty is paid. But the 
American bookseller charges at least seven, 
and frequently eight, dollars for the book. 
Without the duty, he could sell it he would 
be forced by competition to sell it for five dol- 
lars or less, and he would realize upon it the 
profit now realized upon the sale of an aver- 
age American publication. But a still graver 
charge must be brought against the duty on 
English books. Dutiable articles are excluded 
from the mails by the regulations of our pos- 
tal service. It is true that these regulations 
are not enforced with absolute strictness, but 
they operate to make the American intellectual 
worker hesitate to avail himself of the simplest 
and most natural means of getting the books 
he wants, that of ordering them sent direct by 
post. If he happens to reside at a port of en- 
try, he may get his book by going to the cus- 
tom house and paying a sum estimated by 
some illiterate official whose notion of the value 
of books is about as accurate as his acquaint- 
ance with the dead languages. If, as is more 
likely to be the case, our seeker after knowl- 
edge does not live at a port of entry, he runs 
a more than fair chance of not getting his book 
at all. The amount of irritation produced by 
these conditions is not easily calculable. Those 
who conscientiously advocate the principles of 
a protective tariff should realize that it is the 
extreme of unwisdom to make their policy re- 
sponsible for a law that bears only a remote 
relation to that principle, that is chiefly pro- 
ductive of exasperation in the minds of intelli- 
gent people, and that gives our government the 



unenviable credit of seeking to impede the 
progress of culture. It is in every sense an 
unenlightened application of the protective prin- 
ciple, and one that the intelligent men of all 
parties should hasten to repudiate. 

Any opposition to the removal of this tax 
upon knowledge must come from the book- 
sellers and the publishers. In the case of the 
former, it is evident that a few of them the 
very few who have considerable stocks of En- 
glish books upon which duty has already been 
paid might be compelled to sell those books 
at a lowered profit. It would mean a marking 
down of prices to the extent of not more than 
four cents to the shilling. In the case of the 
publishers, there could result no pressure of 
increased competition except in the case of re- 
cent reprints or new editions of old standard 
works. On the other hand, every one of the 
army of ill -paid teachers in our schools and 
colleges, every clergyman, physician, lawyer, 
or other professional worker, every student or 
investigator in whatever department of thought, 
every private individual accumulating a collec- 
tion of books for the purpose of self-culture, 
would be benefited by the removal of the tax, 
not only in pocket, but, as we have already 
pointed out, in increased facility of access to 
the storehouse of contemporary thought. How 
is it possible for anyone to urge that these vastly 
greater interests should be ignored from fear 
that their recognition might temporarily dis- 
turb the trade adjustments of a few purveyors 
of manufactured literature ? 

What is most needful at the present time is 
that the question should be considered seriously 
by Congress. The pressure of other subjects 
upon the attention of that body is so great that 
a duty which involves a question of principle 
rather than of large material interests is likely 
to receive scant consideration. The perpetua- 
tion of the impost upon books may follow from 
mere negligence ; it can hardly be the result of 
a deliberate and rational discussion. Fortu- 
nately, the text of the book section in the orig- 
inal draft of the Wilson Bill is so faulty that it 
can hardly be adopted in the form reported. 
The clause exempting from the tax all books 
which contain the results of scientific observa- 
tions means nothing at all, and might, if adopted 
as it stands, lead to some extraordinary rulings. 
It might fairly be held, for example, to cover 
the Rougon-Macquart novels of M. Zola, which 
would probably surprise the statesmen by whom 
it was framed. For the sake of clearness alone, 
the section must be in some way rewritten, and

we trust that when it emerges in its final shape 
it will leave all kinds of books (except those 
protected by the manufacturing clause of the 
Copyright Law) untaxed for the uses of all 
sorts of persons. 



ENGLISH AT YALE UNIVERSITY. 

[The article printed below is the first of a 
series to be devoted to the subject of English 
in the more important American colleges and 
universities. This series of papers will form 
a conspicuous feature of THE DIAL during 
1894. An article, prepared by some member 
of the faculty concerned, will be devoted to 
each of a considerable number of institutions, 
and opportunity will thus be afforded for a com- 
parison, that cannot fail to be instructive, of 
the methods pursued and the results aimed at. 
The article now offered by Professor Cook 
will be followed by articles from Professor 
Brander Matthews, of Columbia College , Pro- 
fessor Barrett Wendell, of Harvard University; 
Professor Melville B. Anderson, of the Leland 
Stanford, Junior, University ; and many others 
that we shall have the pleasure of announcing 
at a later date. EDR. DIAL.] 

According to the Catalogue, Yale College, or 
the Academical Department of Yale University, has 
this year 1,086 students. There are four men to 
do the work in English, two full professors, Prof. 
Henry A. Beers and myself, and two instructors, 
Dr. W. L. Phelps and Dr. A. W. Colton. Fifteen 
hours a week of English are offered, a three-hour 
course to Sophomores, two two-hour courses to Jun- 
iors, two two-hour courses to Seniors, and two two- 
hour courses to Juniors and Seniors alike. Elim- 
inating duplicates, 550 men avail themselves of the 
offer of English instruction, being rather more than 
one-half the number of students in the College. Of 
these, 283, or all but three members of the class, are 
Sophomores ; the rest are Juniors and Seniors. 
One hour a week of English in the Freshman year, 
or, rather, three hours a week for twelve weeks, is 
laid down in the Catalogue, but, for laqjc of teach- 
ers (the lamented McLaughlin having died in the 
summer vacation), is not given during the current 
Academic year. None of the students at present 
in the University has been required to pass an en- 
trance examination in English, though such a re- 
quirement goes into effect with the beginning of 
the next Academic year. All the Junior and Sen- 
ior work is elective ; the Sophomores choose five 
out of six prescribed subjects, these being Greek, 
Latin, Modern Languages, Mathematics, English 
Literature, and Physics. As was seen above, all 
but three Sophomores elect English this year. 

In the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale Uni- 



versity there are 559 undergraduates. For this 
number two English teachers are provided, a full 
professor, Prof. Thomas R. Lounsbury, and an in- 
structor, Mr. H. A. Smith. Seven and a half hours 
of work in English are provided, a required course 
of one-half an hour per week for Freshmen, con- 
densed into three hours per week for the last six 
weeks of the year, a required course of one hour for 
Juniors, an elective course of three hours for Jun- 
iors, and an elective course of three hours for Sen- 
iors. The Freshman course is given to 228 men, 
the Junior required course to 175, the Junior elect- 
ive course to 49, and the Senior elective course to 
30, including two graduates. Hitherto, as in the 
Academical Department, there has been no entrance 
examination in English, but this will be required in 
1895. 

The Freshman and Sophomore courses in Yale 
College are outlined as follows (the Freshman 
course was actually given last year): 

ENGLISH. The required study of English Literature 
occupies three hours a week through one-third of Fresh- 
man year and the whole of Sophomore year. In Fresh- 
man year Brooke's Primer is read, to give the student 
a view of the whole field; three plays of Shakespeare 
and the minor Engh'sh poems of Milton are read in the 
class-room. 

In Sophomore year the following authors are read^ 
Spenser, Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Addison, Swift, 
Pope, Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, and Gray; and the his- 
tory of the literature is followed in connection with the 
authors. Practice in composition work is afforded by the 
preparation of special papers on each author, which i& 
required of the whole class. 

The Junior and Senior elective courses in Yale 
College are the following. 

Professor Beers : 
English Poetic Masterpieces. (Juniors. Two hours, both 

terms.) 

Critical readings in the class-room in the text of the 
" Canterbury Tales," the " Faery Queene," the principal 
plays of Shakespeare, and the poetry of Milton. 
Georgian Literature of the Nineteenth Century. (Seniors. 

Two hours, both terms.) 

This course consists of critical readings in the class- 
room in the text of the principal English poets from 
Wordsworth to Keats, with outside assigned reading in 
the prose authors of the period. 
Literature of the Early Stuart and Commonwealth Period. 

(Seniors. Two hours, both terms.) 

The literary history of the half century from 1603- 
to 1660, with special reference to the decadence of the 
drama, the development of prose, the "metaphysical 
poets," and the writings of Milton. Students electing 
this course must expect to buy a rather large number 
of books. 

Professor Cook : 
History of English Literature. (Juniors. Two hours,. 

both terms.) 

An outline of the subject, on the basis of Brooke's 
"Primer," Taine, Morley's "First Sketch," and Ten 
Brink's " Early English Literature," with some reading 
of English authors at first hand. Frequent preparation 
of brief papers on assigned topics.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



Old and Middle English. (Two hours, both terms.) 

An elementary course in the beginnings and earlier 
development of the English language and literature. 
The first term is devoted to Cook's " First Book in Old 
English." In the second term this is followed by more 
difficult Old English texts, and by the reading of selec- 
tions from Chaucer and other Middle English writers 
for linguistic purposes. 
Tennyson. (Two hours, first term.) 

Critical study of selected poems. Tennyson's theory 
of life, literary art, and place among the poets of this 
century. Comparative readings in other authors, and 
frequent preparation of brief papers on assigned topics. 
Shakespeare. (Two hours, second term.) 

Critical study of a few selected plays. The Leopold 
-edition of Shakespeare ; Moulton's " Shakespeare as a 
Dramatic Artist"; Schmidt's "Shakespeare-Lexicon"; 
annotated editions of single plays, etc. Frequent pre- 
paration of brief papers on assigned topics. 

Of these the Catalogue offers the subjoined explan- 
ation, with one or two modifications necessary to 
conform the statements more accurately to the exist- 
ing condition of things: 

A course in Old and Middle English is offered to Jun- 
iors and Seniors, and is intended as an introduction to 
a study of the origins of our language and literature. 

A brief survey of the whole field of the History of 
English Literature is attempted, the aim being to give 
such a view of the mutual relations of the principal 
authors and epochs as may enable the student to plan 
courses of English reading and study with intelligence 
and judgment. Instruction in this course is given by 
means of Brooke's Primer of English Literature and 
other text-books, supplemented by topical study pursued 
through the medium of papers prepared by the members 
of the class, which, after being read aloud, are made the 
subject of discussion. 

Opportunity is afforded for the critical study of a num- 
ber of individual authors in as many different courses. 
Among those most frequently studied at present are 
Chaucer, two Elizabethans, Bacon and Shakespeare, and 
two eminent contemporaries of this century, Tennyson 
and Browning. Stress is laid in these courses upon the 
distinctive personality and workmanship of the writer 
in question, but an endeavor is also made to promote 
the conception of literary masterpieces as wholes, as 
works of art subject to the laws of inner unity and har- 
mony, and not merely as texts for verbal study or col- 
lateral illustration. 

Authoritative statements concerning the courses 
of the Sheffield Scientific School are as follows : 

ENGLISH. The course is designed to give the student 
acquaintance with the great representative writers of 
the various epochs. A history of the language is one 
of the studies of the Freshman year; and after that year 
the study of the language is made entirely subordinate 
to that of the literature. During the first term of Ju- 
nior year, however, extracts from Early English authors 
are read, and Early English Grammar is studied, so as 
to familiarize the student with the inflections then in use 
and the distinctions existing between the leading dia- 
lects. It is the aim of this term's work to give such 
knowledge of forms, and to some extent of words, that 
the student will be able to read at sight any Early En- 
glish author whose writings do not involve special diffi- 
culties of language or vocabulary. 



With the second term, the regular study of English 
literature proper begins with Chaucer; and for the rest 
of the course till the end of Senior year the following 
authors are read: Bacon, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, 
Pope, Gray, Goldsmith, and later writers. Those men- 
tioned in the lists are always studied, but other authors 
not named are also taken up, the course varying some- 
what in different years. In all cases, complete works 
of a writer are studied, not extracts; as, for instance, 
several of Chaucer's Tales, and several of the plays of 
Shakespeare. The authors are taken up in chronolog- 
ical order, and the literary history of the time is like- 
wise carried on in connection with the great represent- 
ative writers of each period. 

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. This course, required of 
the entire Junior class, consists of weekly exercises 
based on selections from the writings of well-known 
authors, such as Irving, DeQuincey, and Macaulay. 
While it intends in the first place to give freedom of 
expression and the correction of the most obvious 
faults by practice in writing rapidly the substance of a 
passage previously assigned, it also aims to direct the 
attention of the student to qualities of style and meth- 
ods of composition, to arouse his appreciative interest 
in the works as literature, and to improve the quality 
of his writing by improving the quality of his thought. 
To this end occasional discussions of the selections read 
will occupy a part of the weekly hour. 

The courses of graduate instruction are given un- 
der the direction of the Philosophical Faculty which 
is distinct from that of Yale College or of the Shef- 
field Scientific School, though naturally including 
the principal instructors from both. The courses 
in English are these, besides the undergraduate 
courses in the History of English Literature, Old 
and Middle English, Tennyson, and Shakespeare. 

Professor Lounsbury : 
The English Literature of the Fourteenth Century. 

Professor Beers : 
English Literature. (One hour, both terms.) 

The history of English Romanticism from Thomson to 
Swinburne (1726-1890), with incidental study of the 
parallel movements in Germany and France. The in- 
struction is given mainly by lectures. - Students are re- 
quired to keep and submit notes of their reading, and 
to prepare topical papers from time to time. 

Professor Cook : 

[The strictly graduate courses offered below will be 
given according to circumstances and the needs of the 
graduate students actually in attendance; but special 
attention will be given to the supervision of individual 
research along these and similar lines.] 

Theories of Poetry. (Two hours, second term.) 

A course in the theories of poetry in general, and in 
the principles of criticism applicable to its various de- 
partments, as the epic, dramatic, and lyric. Discussions 
and papers on the basis of standard works, such as Aris- 
totle's " Poetics," Sidney's " Defense of Poesy," Addi- 
son's " Criticisms on Paradise Lost," Boileau's " Art of 
Poetry," Lessing's "Laokoon," and others of similar 
character. 

Old English Poetry. (One hour, first term.) 

The texts used are " Judith " (Cook's edition), Elene " 
(Kent's edition), and " The Battle of Maldon " (Sweet's 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

Reader). These are read, their place in literature ex- 
amined, and questions of authorship, date, and textual 
criticism discussed. Ten Brink's and Wiilcker's Histo- 
ries of Old English Literature are constantly used for 
reference. 

Old English Grammar. (One hour, second term.) 

An exhaustive grammatical examination of some prose 
text is made, on the basis of Cook's " Phonological In- 
vestigation of Old English" and edition of Siever's 
Grammar for Phonology, of the latter for Inflection, 
and of March's Grammar for Syntax. 

Historical English Prosody. (One hour, first term.) 

Schipper's Englische Metrik" is adopted as the 
basis of study, but reference is made to the discrepant 
views of other authorities. 

Middle English Grammar. (One hour, second term.) 

An outline of Middle English Phonology and Inflec- 
tion is given by means of lectures, and the knowledge 
thus gained is applied in a grammatical study of Chau- 
cer, on the basis of Ten Brink's "Chaucers Sprache 
und Verskunst." 

It will be observed that there is at present no 
systematic instruction in Rhetoric in Yale Univer- 
sity, and that in Yale College composition is taught 
but incidentally, in connection with the preparation 
of papers in the literature classes. In the Sheffield 
Scientific School, Juniors receive instruction in com- 
position for an hour a week throughout the year. 

In estimating the amount of work performed by 
the members of the teaching staff, it must not be 
overlooked that, because of the size of the classes 
and the number of divisions, a three-hour course 
often represents twelve hours of instruction per 
week, and a two-hour course four or six, and that 
the professors who give undergraduate instruction 
are the only ones to offer courses in the Graduate 
School. To compare the equipment in English with 
that in some other departments of the College proper 
it may be mentioned that this year there have been 
seven men in Greek, four professors, one assist- 
ant professor, and two instructors ; in Mathematics 
seven, three professors, two assistant professors, 
and two tutors ; and in Latin six, three professors, 
one instructor, and two tutors. 

Only one linguistic course in English is offered 
in Yale College, and this is pursued by but three un- 
dergraduates, though by four or five times that num- 
ber of graduates. This will indicate that the study 
of English linguistics ( the term philology of course 
comprises literary study ) has not yet secured a firm 
foothold in the College proper. 

The method of teaching most employed through- 
out the College and Scientific School is a combina- 
tion of recitation and lecture, or recitations alterna- 
ting with occasional lectures. The combination of 
recitation and lecture might more accurately be de- 
scribed as recitation intermingled with discussion, 
or with informal comments by the instructor. The 
Seminar has not yet been introduced, but I expect 
to begin a graduate seminary in Ben Jonson within 
the next three or four weeks, having, by way of 
stepping-stone, already organized a Journal Club, 



which is in successful operation, for reporting on 
professional periodicals. 

The general purpose of the undergraduate liter- 
ary instruction in both departments is to foster the 
love of literature and the development of the crit- 
ical sense, implying, as the latter does, the fullest 
appreciation of all excellent qualities. Methods 
vary, as they must, with the individuality of the 
teacher. The writer might formulate the especial 
object which he proposes to himself as the develop- 
ment in the student, whether graduate or under- 
graduate, of insight and power, and indeed he con- 
ceives this to be the end of all education whatever. 
The imparting of information seems to him quite a 
secondary object ; and a love for literature is most 
likely, as he thinks, to be promoted by the acquisi- 
tion of insight and power. Of course these terms 
must be taken in the broadest sense, so as to include 
the emotional and aesthetic faculties as well as the 
purely intellectual, the will and the moral nature 
no less than the reason. To this end no study can 
be better suited than English, its comprehensive- 
ness, variety, and richness of content rendering it 
an 'unsurpassed aliment of the spiritual life, while, 
by proper methods of instruction, it may be made a 
most effective instrument of spiritual discipline.

My neighbor was a forester, 

And ranged with bow and spear; 

I was a simple gardener, 

And delved the whole round year. 

Time came when both a-weary were, 

And both resolved on change; 
So he became a gardener, 

And I the woods did range. 

The seed springs never to the light, 

He chides the soil, the air ! 
The forest genii, in despite, 

Adrift mine arrows bear ! 

Folk say the woods be full of deer, 
The wild-flowers praise the soil: 

But flower nor game, the whole round year, 
Rewards our alien toil.

gusto in the writer which is sure to interest the 
reader. Wicked men have written hymns, but never 
such as could rival those of Watts. Landsmen have 
written of the sea, but, with the possible exception 
of Barry Cornwall, to very little purpose. I think 
it is safe to hazard the assertion that the true ring 
is almost always lacking unless the writer speaks 
of that which is a part of himself, of his experi- 
ence, of his " properties " either of race or of en- 
vironment. 

Christopher North who as an essayist reminds 
one of that passage in Ossian, " Who comes like the 
strength of rivers when their crowded waters glit- 
ter to the moon," on one occasion makes allusion 
to the subject of transplanted genius. As illustra- 
tion of the fatefulness of this crucial test, he cites 
the case of Home, the author of " Douglas." This 
Highland youth, coming from the land of storm 
and rock, had produced a drama, the success of 
which was phenomenal. But when beckoning for- 
tune urged him to repair to London, his genius, in 
North's eloquent characterization, "became Angli- 
iied, took a consumption, and died." All that per- 
tained to the north wind, the heather, or the snow, 
was property intellectual assets, familiar from 
childhood, out of which he might construct drama 
or ballad. But when he came among a more conven- 
tional people, with a tamer civilization, he grew 
homesick and ill at ease with an apprehension that 
to the self-contained Sassenach his finest eloquence 
must seem but tumid rhetoric. He was among a 
people whom he did not know. There is nothing 
in the daily life of England which could justify the 
explanation, " My name is Norval," etc.; and finally 
he sees himself confronted with what to his High- 
land spirit is the most discouraging element of all 
ridicule. 

Take a more familiar instance. Scott has for 
over half a century held an unassailable position 
as the great writer of dramatic fiction. Nothing 
is more remarkable in the author of " Waverley " 
than his marvellous versatility. How many sub- 
jects he touched, and with what skill ! The strug- 
gle between Norman and Saxon, in " Ivanhoe " ; 
the ferine tortuousness of Louis the Eleventh, in 
" Quentin Durward " ; the varied scenes from almost 
every era in Scottish history, how to the life! 
And no wonder; for he had been an explorer of 
their dusty archives from his boyhood. The men 
of history he knew, and was of them. But when 
he comes to write of the sea, Micawber himself, in 
seaman's attire, hitching his trousers and shivering 
his timbers, is not a more absurd figure. The great 
romancer was ignorant of nautical life, and his 
imagination could not save him. Fenimore Cooper 
was confessedly his inferior in literary attainments, 
but as a writer he may be considered amphibious. 
Criticism hesitates to choose between those mas- 
terpieces, the "Leather-Stocking Tales," so redo- 
lent of the woods and so breathless with peril, and 
those unsurpassed delineations of sea life, "The 
Red Rover," "Wing and Wing," "The Water- 



Witch," " The Sea-Lion." The explanation of this 
versatility is very simple: Cooper was brought up 
amid the wilds and forests about Otsego Lake, and 
was familiar with frontier life (of that day) and 
Indian tradition ; while his youth and early man- 
hood were spent at sea as a naval officer. But 
Cooper, when he wrote "The Bravo," had to do 
with things unfamiliar, and accordingly the public 
missed the joyous allure which made his former 
work so fascinating. 

Certain critics have assumed that Burns was a 
poet who could write in two languages, and was not, 
therefore, limited to his original field ; and they 
assume this because the same hand that drew the 
masterpiece " Tam-o-Shanter " was also responsible 
for one of the sweetest idyls in the English lan- 
guage, " The Cotter's Saturday Night," written in 
the purest Saxon and in the Spenserian stanza. But 
ah ! it was the same Bobby Burns writing of the same 
people, and trying to show, for once, that his pathos 
needed no dialect to give verisimilitude. The scenes 
he describes are everywhere familiar to his boy- 
hood and throughout his brief manhood ; in short, 
he never wrote save of what he knew too well. 

So wholly are some authors aware of the neces- 
sity of personal experience in order to impart vrai- 
semblance to a narrative, that at times they decline 
to use invention except for the embellishment of 
their work; that is to say, they do not literally 
write fiction, but apply to fact the " light that never 
was." One day a London publisher called upon 
a little English authoress whose anonymous book 
had set the world "murmuring like a hive of bees." 
I refer to the author of "Jane Eyre' 1 a person- 
ality so shy, so reticent, that the writer's sex was 
not revealed by the nom de plume. The publisher, 
adverting to the extraordinary sale of her second 
book, " Shirley," urged the continuance of her ef- 
forts in so successful a field. " I cannot," she re- 
plied, demurely, " at least not for some years. I 
have written all that I know. I must live more." 

A similar illustration might be drawn from among 
the writers on this side of the Atlantic. Bret Harte, 
after he had made his greatest successes, was often 
urged by publishers in New York and Boston to 
write of scenes more familiar to the East, sub- 
jects less quaintly technical of the frontier than were 
those of his earlier stories. " No," he replied, " I 
was many years studying the life and language of 
the frontier. It would take me years to learn a 
new language to realize another life." Yet he 
tried the experiment, with what success, readers 
of " Thankful Blossom " can testify. 

In brief, when the most intelligent and skilful 
persons venture to write concerning countries or 
places other than their own either by birth, or 
adoption, or by residence, so long as to shut out 
earlier impressions they will seldom write other- 
wise than as the tourist. Madame de Stael wrote 
beautifully of Germany, but it is not the Germany 
that Teutons recognize. Longfellow wrote "Hy- 
perion," a work of pure imagination, faintly tinct-

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"JAPANESE METAPHOR AND SIMILE." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of January 16 is a communication, un- 
der the above caption, from Mr. Frederick Ives Carpen- 
ter, who discusses Mr. Lafcadio Ream's and Professor 
Chamberlain's statements concerning the use of simile, 
metaphor, personification, and allegory, among the Jap^ 
anese. This is, in fact, a much mooted question, with 
the chances rather in favor of those two thorough stu- 
dents of "things Japanese." And yet Mr. Carpenter 
cites a number of illustrations to the contrary; and to 
these I beg to add a few, gathered in connection with 
the teaching of English in a government school in the 
interior of Japan. 

" Time flies as swiftly as an arrow." " When we think 
about the things of the past, all are like dreams." " Of 
course, this fruit [the 'honor' of graduation] could not 
be obtained without the flower, our own diligence and 
energy." When we consider our positions in a new 
society, we are like a ship in the broad, limitless ocean. 
We cannot move without a compass." And, instead 
of arriving at our promised harbor, we shall strike 
against dreadful rocks and be broken into pieces, or we 
shall be destroyed by the raging waves." " But hap- 
pily and fortunately we have received a compass with 
which we can move. What is that compass ? It is the 
education which we received in school." " If we do not 
use the knowledge we have already received, we are 
only Hving book-boxes." So the Empire is our pa- 
rent." These sentences are all taken from a single 
graduating essay. A pupil of the same school once said 
to the foreign teacher : You are my light and my ship 
to across the sea of English language." 

The study of the etymology of Japanese words often 
reveals in the language fossil metaphors which are not 
uninteresting, but of which only a few examples at ran- 
dom may be cited here. The Japanese word for mule " 
literally means "rabbit-horse"; an "animal" is only a 
"hairy thing"; the "Adam's apple" is a "throat- 
dumpling"; a "glove" is simply a "hand-bag"; a 
" porcupine " is a "pin-rat"; "cream "is the "milk's 
upper skin "; a " dentist " is, of course, a " tooth-doctor"; 
the " gums " are " teeth-roots "; molasses " is " sugar- 
honey "; and subjects " (in composition) are " seeds of 
speech." 

And yet the contention of Messrs. Chamberlain, 
Hearn, Dening, and others, is in the main correct, at 
least from a comparative point of view. As a rule, the 
typical Japanese is very practical and matter-of-fact, as 
some of the fossil metaphors above cited show. He 
cares little for linguistic beauties, idealistic turns of 
expression, and metaphysical niceties. As a "born" 



esthete, he might be expected to enjoy the beauty of 
ngurative language; but he is a lover of nature, of the 
real and the actual more than of the fanciful and the 
figurative. 

Mr. Percival Lowell, in " The Soul of the Far East " 
has picturesquely followed out this same idea of the im- 
personality of Japanese thought as expressed in that 
language, m which inflectional or formational distinc- 
tions of gender and number and person are lacking He 
asserts that "the idea of supposing sex where there is 
not even life is altogether too fanciful a notion for the 
lar Eastern mind." But he is compelled to admit some 
personification in the deifying of natural phenomena 
the sun-goddess, the moon-god (dess ?), the wind-god 
the fire-god, the thunder-god, etc. He says, however,' 
in respect to this: "Even such personification of natural 
forces, simple enough to be self-suggested, quickly dis- 
appeared." 

And one thing at least is certain: that the Japanese, 
even though in his national childhood he deified the 
forces of nature, did not generally go so far with his 
spirit of fancy as, like the Greeks, to people the beau- 
tiful trees and flowers of his land with fairies. He ad- 
mired, and admires, the beauties of nature just as they 
are; he loves a flower as a flower. 

" A primrose by a river's brim 
A yellow primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more "; 

except that, as " nothing more " than a real flower, it 
was full of beauty. T,

THE "STAR SYSTEM" IN PERIODICALS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It was a very apt criticism, when a certain periodical 
was spoken of by one of our most respectable dailies, a 
few years ago, as " Mr. Blank's sensational monthly 
newspaper." It is the great fault of the " star system," 
discussed by a writer in THE DIAL of January 16, that 
it has supplanted a valuable type of literature with ma- 
terial which has its appropriate place (so much of it, 
I mean, as deserves any place at all) in the columns of 
the daily and weekly press. When the " star " is a 
Congressman or a Senator (the order here is intentional) 
the chances are that the " Congressional Record " and 
the morning papers will furnish us material from the 
same pen better in every respect than that which is se- 
cured by the " star " magazine editor. This could be 
demonstrated again and again by comparing speeches 
delivered in Congress during the past year with articles 
printed in prominent Reviews from the same men. A 
quarter's worth of postal-cards to Congressmen will se- 
cure more literature of that kind than a whole year's 
subscription to one of these magazines; and if Amer- 
ican thoughtlessness did not once in a while get the bet- 
ter of American thrift, the people would resort to the 
cheaper source of supply. 

Is it not within the range of possibilities that a really 
dignified Review, of the old-fashioned type and tradi- 
tions, should be produced and maintained in the United 
States ? Such periodicals as THE DIAL, " The Nation," 
and " The Critic " are doing an admirable work, which 
no one would be willing to see interfered with ; but 
their field is entirely different from that in question, and 
if the latter should be occupied they would be helped, 
not hindered, in their task. . W H JOHNSON

MASSACHUSETTS: Ax OBJECT LESSOX.* 

Six years ago, Mr. Brooks Adams put forth 
a book entitled : " The Emancipation of Mas- 
sachusetts," in which he took a very pessimis- 
tic view of his native State. We gave at the 
time an elaborate review of it in THE DIAL 
(Vol. VII., p. 263). It was a book of large 
pretensions, of swaggering assertions, and of 
very little historical merit. The most striking 
incident concerning it was the fact that it was 
written by the youngest scion of a family which 
had been identified for many generations with 
the proudest annals of Massachusetts and of 
the Nation, and had furnished two Presidents 
of the United States. There were callow and 
dudish symptoms in the style and treatment 
which almost disarmed criticism, and inspired 
the hope that the young man, as he matured, 
would recover the ancestral spirit and gripe, and 
see much to respect and venerate in the history 
of his native State, as his ancestors had done. 
In the review named, we spoke, by way of 
contrast, of the writings of those ancestors 
which were commendatory of Massachusetts, 
and of some excellent contributions by the 
author's elder brother, Mr. Charles Francis 
Adams. We are now sorry to say that this 
elder brother has just put forth a book on Mas- 
sachusetts written in the same pessimistic spirit 
but not with the same feebleness and empty 
assertion as the one already noticed. It has 
bright and epigrammatic clauses, plausible half- 
truths, and stinging libels, which may be quoted 
with effect. It is an armory from which the 
bitter enemies of Massachusetts and of the Puri- 
tan fathers may draw the poisoned arrows they 
need. And this war-material is furnished by 
a son of Massachusetts ! 

It was said of John Adams, more than a 
century ago : " If any one predicts what Mr. 
Adams will do, it is certain that Mr. Adams 
will do something else." This uncertainty as 
to "what Mr. Adams will do" is a family 
characteristic, and honestly survives in the pres- 
ent generation. In drawing party lines, the 
Adamses were always the unclassified element ; 
for when it was least expected, they jumped 
their party traces. 

" An Object Lesson " is the best part of 

* MASSACHUSETTS : Its Historians and Its History. An 
Object Lesson. By Charles Francis Adams. Boston : Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. 



the title of Mr. Charles Francis Adams's book, 
for it shows what an able man and a vigor- 
ous writer, who has strong theological preju- 
dices, with some personal and family idiosyn- 
crasies, can do, if he tries, in writing about his 
native State, the foundations of which were 
laid by his own ancestors. The work is any- 
thing but eulogistic ; and, with a few exceptional 
instances of just and impartial treatment, is cap- 
tious, narrow, bitter in spirit, and defamatory. 
It evidently was hastily thrown together, made 
up of old material, and shows slight information 
on the obscure points of Massachusetts history. 
Of the historians of the State whom he prom- 
ised to write about, he says little besides fre- 
quently characterizing them as " filio-pietistic 
writers." Dr. Palfrey is the only one he names, 
and he seems to have for the amiable Doctor 
a special spite. His own father and grand- 
father and great-grandfather were writers of 
Massachusetts history. Would he regard them 
as " filio-pietistic, perverting the facts and dis- 
torting the record " ? 

By his over- worked expression, "filio-piet- 
ism," he means " filial piety " or " veneration 
for one's ancestors." The compound word is 
doubtless his own invention ; for it is bad in 
construction and in signification, and is not in 
literature nor the dictionaries. " Pietism " and 
" pietistic " are English words, and do not have 
the meaning he assigns to them. They are de- 
rived from and used only in reference to the 
" Pietists," a sect in Germany noted for strong 
religious feeling rather than intellectual ortho- 
doxy. Nevertheless, with the meaning of " re- 
spect for one's ancestors," our author uses them 
as terms of reproach ; whereas such respect is 
not only a natural and laudable sentiment, but 
in oriental countries is regarded as one of the 
highest virtues, and akin to religion. The lit- 
erary reputation of Mr. Adams would be im- 
proved if his writings showed some symptoms 
of this quality. 

John Quincy Adams, our present author's 
grandfather, in a historical address delivered 
in 1843, said : 

" The primary cause of the various settlements in 
New England was religion. It was not the search for 
gold, nor the pursuit of wealth. It was the Christian 
religion purified and refined from its corruptions by the 
fires of persecution. With that religion was inseparably 
connected the code of Christian morals in its simplicity 
and purity a code, above all others, resting upon the 
fundamental principle of the natural equality of man- 
kind." 

The purpose for which New England was 
settled is thus stated in the preamble of the 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

compact of union made by the Commissioners 
of the four Colonies, in 1643 : 

" Whereas, we all came into these parts of America 
with one and the same end and aim, namely: to advance 
the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to enjoy the 
liberties of the Gospel in purity and peace ; and whereas," 
etc. 

The grand charge which the grandson brings 
against the founders of Massachusetts and their 
descendants is, that they had too much reli- 
gion, and had the worst kind of religion. They 
were Calvinists, and believed in eternal punish- 
ment and hell-fire. Theirs, he says, was " a 
religious practice or creed which has now be- 
come abhorent, and is recognized as morbid. 
The simple fact is that the Calvinistic, ortho- 
dox tenets of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries constituted nothing more nor less 
than an outrage on human nature." Such a 
statement, by an alleged historian of the nine- 
teenth century, would be comical, if it had not 
been written in sober earnest, and was not u An 
Object Lesson " of the odium theologicum of a 
narrow and illiberal clique of historical writers 
which flourishes in our day. Mr. Adams later 
shows what sort of religion the forefathers 
ought to have had. The misfortune is that 
they did not find such religion in the New Tes- 
tament, and it had not then been invented. 

" The struggle for equality of man before the 
law, on the one hand," says Mr. Adams, " and 
freedom of conscience [or full religious tolera- 
tion, as he elsewhere terms it], on the other, 
constitutes the theme of modern history. I 
propose to study them in our Massachusetts 
history." Like his theology, his definition of 
the scope of history is very narrow. That of 
John Quincy Adams was much broader : " His- 
tory is the record of the transactions of human 
beings associated in communities." The doc- 
trine of the equality of man was the offspring 
of Puritanism. That the peasant, in his rights 
before the law, was equal to the priest and the 
nobleman, was in the seventeenth century a new 
and strange theory, and contrary to the tradi- 
tions and social habits of the English people. 
The peasant was the last to comprehend the 
fact ; but it was doctrine of the English Com- 
monwealth. On the Restoration of Charles II. 
the old social inequality came back, and it sur- 
vives in England to this day. The good seed of 
equality had been planted in the Massachusetts 
Colony, and there found a congenial soil and 
rich fruitage. Mr. Adams says : 

" So far as equality before the law personal civil 
liberty is concerned, the record of no community seems 
to me more creditable, more consistent, than that of Mas- 



sachusetts. No other portion of the world was then 
ready to accept so startling a paradox. From the days, 
of the settlement, through the revolution, down to the fall 
of slavery, in the principles of civil liberty and human 
rights, Massachusetts has always been in the front." 

The views of Mr. Adams on this point are 
historically just and well expressed. " As re- 
spects religious toleration," he says, " it has 
been of a character wholly different." He 
means that the colonists did not allow inter- 
lopers and ranting sects to come in and break 
up their temporal and spiritual paradise. This 
is true, and it was a policy that needs no apol- 
ogy and scarcely an explanation. Self-defense 
is an instinct of human nature ; and unless the 
colonists had shut out the swarm of ranting 
and abusive religious sects which were ready 
to pounce upon them with the plea of relig- 
ious toleration, the Colony would have been 
blotted out in less than five years. The plant- 
ers were making a settlement for themselves, 
where they might enjoy civil and religious 
freedom in peace and quietude. They knew, 
by the outrages committed by the anarchistic 
sects that had ravaged Germany and the Neth- 
erlands for nearly a century, and by experience 
with the new crop of fanatics that were then 
disturbing England, what the specious plea of 
religious toleration meant. The term " tolera- 
tion " the colonists hated ; and the sects that 
used it they dreaded. 

The Anabaptist disturbance began in Ger- 
many soon after the Reformation under Luther 
was in progress. It grew out of a controversy 
whether or not infants should be baptized, and 
whether or not persons baptized in infancy 
should be re-baptized when they joined their 
new sects. The original subject in dispute was 
soon lost sight of in the melee that followed ; 
but it gave a name to the wretched fanaticism. 
The sects that sprang up were very numerous, 

such as Antinomians, Familists, Dippers, 

Waterlanders, etc. They opposed alike the Re- 
formation and the Catholic Church, demanded 
full religious toleration, and persecuted every- 
body else with fire and sword. Their head- 
quarters were at Miinster, in Westphalia, which 
they captured, and crowned John (a tailor) of 
Leyden as King of New Zion, They practiced 
polygamy ; and every excess of cruelty and im- 
morality abounded. Conservative parties and 
the civil government organized against them. 
Their leaders were captured, tortured to death 
with red-hot pincers, and hung up in iron cages 
as a warning to that sort of people. Their 
operations had extended to Switzerland and

the Netherlands, and filled the minds of En- 
glishmen with horror and apprehension. 

When Massachusetts was settled, England 
was filled with malignant, whimsical, heady, and 
fantastic sects, all holding to religious tolera- 
tion. Their purpose and practice were to make 
all the disturbance they could ; and they were 
ready to go to the ends of the earth to do it. To 
America they looked as a rich field for their 
pestering energies. Some professed to be in- 
spired, and to have special revelations from 
heaven. Their conduct in England was abusive 
and disorderly ; they were arrested by the po- 
lice, and filled the prisons and guard-rooms. 
They assailed churches, disturbed religious as- 
semblies, fought other sects, and, claiming full 
toleration, made themselves general nuisances. 
The Quakers now the mildest and most in- 
offensive of people were one of these disor- 
derly sects. George Fox, their founder, spent 
most of his life in prison as a disturber of the 
peace, and for offenses which in Chicago to- 
day would send him to the Bridewell. A full 
catalogue and description of these sects and 
their principles may be read in the following 
contemporary publications :

safety, to encounter, expulse, and resist, by force of arms, 
as well by sea as by land, and by all fitting ways and 
means whatsoever, all such person or persons as shall at 
any time hereafter attempt or enterprise the destruction, 
invasion, detriment, or annoyance of the said plantation, 
or inhabitants thereof." 

Their Charter, also, gave them in fee-simple 
the land within the bounds described ; namely, 
from three miles south of the Charles river to 
three miles north of the Merrimack river, and 
east and west from ocean to ocean. This land 
was not sold, but was allotted to towns and dis- 
tributed as a gift to their own people. Stran- 
gers were not allowed a residence, and much 
less citizenship. The colonists were legally a 



close corporation as much so as a modern land 
company, having the right to exclude persons 
whom they deemed undesirable as settlers, and 
to " expulse " those who gave them trouble. 
They put this right into operation as soon as 
they landed ; and during the first year they 
sent back to England fourteen interlopers and 
persons immoral or troublesome. During the 
first ten years they banished twenty such per- 
sons, which served as a warning to a multitude 
of malignant sectaries who would have come 
uninvited. As it was, they were pestered al- 
most beyond endurance by straggling fanatics 
who came in defiance of law and the rights of 
the colonists. What an idiotic policy it had 
been if they had proclaimed Toleration to all 
comers, as Mr. Adams thinks they should have 
done ! Fortunately, the founders of the Mas- 
sachusetts Colony were not idiots. The world 
was not ready for Toleration. The different re- 
ligious sects, as a rule, then quarrelled and per- 
secuted each other as if by instinct. 

When the forefathers talked and wrote so 
earnestly about the blessings of religious lib- 
erty, they had in mind no abstract principle of 
general application ; for such an application 
was then impossible. They meant liberty for 
themselves the undisturbed opportunity of 
enjoying the rights of their own consciences, 
immunity from the errors, formalism, and per- 
secution of the English churches, and escape 
from the annoyances of the pestering sects that 
abounded in England. 

It is an old and stale charge, made by malig- 
nant enemies of the Puritans of whom Mr. 
Adams appears to be one that the founders 
of Massachusetts were theorists, and came over 
to establish universal religious liberty which 
the said malignants define as general religious 
Toleration ; and, because it was not done, they 
heap upon the fathers every term of reproach, 
and Mr. Adams styles those who have read and 
made history aright, " filio-pietistie writers who 
have recourse to every form of sophistry to pal- 
liate or excuse this action." To the candid 
student of the early annals, nothing can be 
more obvious than the original opinions and in- 
tentions of the first settlers, and that they de- 
tested no expression more than the word " Tol- 
eration." Their first Synod of 1637, and the 
banishment of Anne Hutchinson, with John 
Wheelwright and their associates the same 
year, brought out the fact, with startling sig- 
nificance, that the Massachusetts Colony was 
no place for religious cranks. Nathaniel Ward, 
in his " Simple Cobler of Aggawam," 1647,

said : " My heart hath naturally detested tolera- 
tions of divers religions "; and yet he was the 
man who six years before had written the " Body 
of Liberties of the Massachusetts Colonie " 
(1641), the noble preamble of which has the 
ring of the Declaration of Independence, 1776 : 
" The free fruition of such liberties, immunities, and 
privileges as humanity, civility, and Christianity call for, 
as due to every man in his place and proportion, with- 
out impeachment and infringement, hath ever been, and 
will ever be, the tranquility and stability of Churches 
and Commonwealths; and the denial ordeprival thereof, 
the disturbance, if not the ruin, of both." 

Samuel Willard, in 1661, said : 

" I perceive they [the Quakers] are mistaken in the 
design of our first planters, whose business was not Tol- 
eration, but were professed enemies of it. Their busi- 
ness was to settle and secure religion to posterity ac- 
cording to that way which they believed was of God." 

Mr. Adams cannot see how the record of 
Massachusetts differs from that of Spain under 
Philip II., of France under Louis XIV., and 
of England under the Stuarts. This is too 
simple a problem to resolve for his benefit at 
this time. He says " a theological glacier set- 
tled down upon Massachusetts in 1637 which 
lasted for nearly a century and a half ; and 
generations grew up under the benumbing in- 
fluence of provincial life and teaching." " Gla- 
cier," " ice-period," and " benumbing " are the 
favorite and most frequent metaphors in the 
book. For a people under such frigid and be- 
numbed conditions, they were always vigilant, 
and at times unusually lively. In 1643 they 
formed a union, for the purposes of defense, 
with the other three New England Colonies. 
By wise diplomacy and prudent delay, in 1664 
they defeated the schemes of the four royal 
commissioners sent over to bring away their 
charter. They were not asleep nor hibernat- 
ing when, about that time, the Quakers came 
over to persecute them ; but, on the other hand, 
they made it quite lively for the Quakers. They 
carried on and finished up King Philip's War 
in 1675, like good soldiers, and the Indians 
never discovered they were benumbed. By sea 
they made an expedition against Port Royal in 
1690, at their own expense ; and by a siege, 
in 1745, captured Louisburg from the French. 
In the long French and Indian War which 
ended in the capture of Canada, they bore a 
conspicuous part. In the " Great Awakening," 
or religious revival, of 1740, Mr. Adams thinks 
they displayed too much energy. 

How much Toleration was there in Virginia 
during that century and a half? Hening's 
Virginia Statutes at Large will give the infor- 



mation. The penalty for absence from the En- 
glish Established Church and no other preach- 
ing was allowed on a Sunday was a pound of 
tobacco ; and for a month's absence fifty pounds. 
In England the fine for not attending church 
was 12d., and for keeping a servant who did 
not go to church for a month, XI 0. Were peo- 
ple in the other American colonies happier and 
more intelligent than in Massachusetts ? 

The Rhode Island Colony had Toleration, and 
were its people benefited thereby ? Mr. Adams 
thinks they had too much of this blessing, for 
it brought them misery, and that continually- 
He says : 

" Anything taken in excess acts as a poison; no mat- 
ter how good or healthful it may be in itself and in 
proper quantities. Rhode Island went through this ex- 
perience in its early days. It was the dumping-ground 
for the surplus intellectual activity of New England, 
The born agitator, the controversialist, the generally 
otherwise-minded, every type of thinker, whether 
crude and half-crazy like Samuel Gorton, or only ad- 
vanced like Roger Williams, there found refuge." 

This is a fair description of the sort of peo- 
ple whidh the Massachusetts founders tried to 
keep out ; and Mr. Adams, while he blames 
them for so doing, does not hesitate to give the 
result of the Rhode Island experiment, although 
it is fatal to his theory : 

" Thus what was a good and most necessary element 
in the economy of nature and the progress of human 
development, was in excess in Rhode Island; and the 
natural result followed, a disordered community. It 
could not have been otherwise; it was inevitable. Mas- 
sachusetts rejected and expelled whatever it did not 
[and could not] assimilate ; and so did Spain. They had 
always before their eyes an object lesson of the most 
unfortunate character in the Colony of Rhode Island, 
an object lesson which was made to do active service 
with the Massachusetts theologians then, as it has with 
its historians since." 

Why, pray, should not the confessed failure 
of Toleration in Rhode Island the only exper- 
iment which was tried be used by historians 
as an " object lesson " ? Cotton Mather said 
in his " Magnalia ": " If a man had lost his 
religion, he might find it in the general mus- 
ter of religious opinions in Rhode Island." 

Jonathan Edwards Mr. Adams regards as 
" a curiosity, a vast glacial boulder, the legiti- 
mate outcome of orthodoxy, with a powerful 
and acute intellect, a man of pure life and 
gentle, kindly nature. His God was a horrible 
fetich, a demon of injustice, vengeance, and 
wrath, and a cruelty of disposition at once in- 
finite and insatiable. And this frightful night- 
mare, this access of morbid superstition, he de- 
duced logically from the Scriptures." He gives 
extended extracts from the sermons of Edwards

on the punishment of the wicked, in order to 
show that the above portrayal of the man and 
his doctrines is not exaggerated. Only one 
phase, however, of the preaching of Edwards 
is shown in these extracts. It is the evident 
intention of Mr. Adams to convey the impres- 
sion that such preaching was peculiar to New 
England ; whereas in Europe it was common 
in the Catholic and Protestant churches of that 
time. If his theological reading had been wider, 
he would have found abundant instances of sim- 
ilar and even more lurid rhetoric, in the ser- 
mons of English and Continental preachers. 
Here is the title of a sermon by John Bunyan, 
" the sweet dreamer of Bedford jail," published 
in London in 1675, and treating the subject in 
his plain and realistic style : " Sighs from 
Hell ; or, Groans of a Damned Soul." 

Mr. Adams touches very lightly on the witch- 
craft craze of 1692 ; and he falls into the mis- 
takes of Mr. Lecky, who asserts that it " was 
simply the natural result of Puritanical teach- 
ing," and that "during the period of the Com- 
monwealth, probably more alleged witches per- 
ished in England than in the whole period be- 
fore and after." Both writers ought to have 
known that myriads of victims of the supersti- 
tion perished before Puritanism was heard of, 
and that the delusion raged more fearfully in 
Catholic than in Protestant countries, 30,000 
persons having been burned in the British isl- 
ands, 75,000 in France, 100,000 in Germany, 
and untold numbers in Spain and southern 
Europe. Of those executed in England, prob- 
ably not one-thirtieth part of them perished 
during the Commonwealth. The statistics and 
shocking details of witch executions in England 
have not been written up, and have never com- 
mended themselves as a subject of thorough 
historical investigation to an English antiquary. 
An Englishman prefers to talk about New- 
England witchcraft, of which much is matter 
of court record. The penal statutes against 
witchcraft enacted by James I. were not re- 
pealed until 1736. The whole number who 
suffered in New England was only thirty-two ; 
and English churchmen and American " liber- 
als" still presume to taunt the Puritans of New 
England with being excessively superstitious 
for men of their time. 

The mild penal code existing in early Mas- 
sachusetts, by the side of what Mr. Adams 
calls "a most sulphurous theological creed," 
he regards as an historical anomaly. In the 
first code of Massachusetts laws, the " Body of 
Liberties," 1641, there were only twelve capi- 



tal offenses named. When Sir William Black- 
stone was delivering his law lectures at Oxford, 
115 years later, there were 160 capital offenses 
on the English statute books. A statute in the 
twenty-second year of Henry VIII. provided 
that criminals convicted of murder should be 
boiled to death, and many victims suffered the 
penalty. 

Other anomalies puzzle Mr. Adams and plead 
for explanation, that a people so priest-ridden, 
so benumbed and under a " glacial mass of su- 
perstition and terrorism" should have made the 
model Constitution of 1780, " which," he says, 
" first fixed on philosophical principles the lines 
and limitations of what is known as the Amer- 
ican Constitution, and pioneered the way for the 
Federal Constitution of 1787," that its minis- 
ters preached rigid conformity in religion and 
stubborn independence in politics, that secu- 
lar education and general intelligence were so 
fondly and persistently cherished, that from 
the earliest times the ministers and churches 
had been a part of the governmental machinery, 
and " that, in time, the intellect of Massachu- 
setts, schooled by self-government, did work 
itself out from under the incubus of supersti- 
tion, prejudice, and narrow conformity imposed 
upon it by the first generation of magistrates 
and ministers." 

Mr. Adams discovers a solution of these ano- 
malies, and ascribes the salvation of Massachu- 
setts to jjolitics. Assuming that the glacial 
period extended to February, 1761, when the 
revolutionary struggle over the Writs of Assist- 
ance began, he asserts that politics from that 
date overshadowed their religious life, and the 
people emerged from their long benumbed and 
frigid condition. 

In arriving at this sapient conclusion, Mr. 
Adams is unmindful of the fact that the Mas- 
sachusetts colonists were politicians from the 
start, and never lost sight of their civil state 
and its stability as a government. Religion 
was a part of their politics, and politics a large 
part of their religion. Under the Stuarts they 
were in constant danger of losing their charter, 
and their perpetual controversies with the Crown 
gave them a training in diplomacy, and a famil- 
iarity with legal precedents and the rights of 
Englishmen better even than the Prime Minis- 
ter possessed. Hence they were the most acute 
diplomatists and politicians of their time. Anne 
Hutchinson and Roger Williams were banished 
more for their bad politics than for their bad 
religion. The former was a disturber (ft social 
order, and the latter challenged the validity of

the Colony charter. The Quakers were a griev- 
ous nuisance when they disturbed religious 
meetings, broke glass bottles over ministers' 
heads as a sign of emptiness, and when their 
maidens appeared in church clothed in sack- 
cloth and ran through the streets without cloth- 
ing of any sort. All this might have been en- 
dured ; but when they shook their fists in the 
faces of the magistrates, and shouted in defiant 
tones, " Thou hast no government ; thy charter 
is not worth the skin on which it is written ; 
no, we will not go back to Rhode Island ; we 
came here to die ; thou darst not hang us,"- 
short work was made of those four Quakers. 
Of the many instances where the colonists have 
been blamed for using severe measures, there 
was probably not one in which politics did not 
furnish a stronger motive for such treatment 
than religion. With more historical accuracy 
Mr. Adams might have said that his forefathers 
had too much politics. His theory that politics 
resolved a glacial period of a century and a half 
seems to need confirmation ; and proof is also 
needed that such a glacial period ever existed. 

The advent of Unitarianism shares with pol- 
itics the honor, in Mr. Adams's mind, of having 
saved Massachusetts. It came rather late ; for 
if Massachusetts has been saved, it was saved 
before May 5, 1819, when William Ellery 
Channing preached the sermon at the ordina- 
tion of Jared Sparks at Baltimore. In the 
summer (June and August) of 1837 Unita- 
rianism "flowered," he says, when Theodore 
Parker was ordained a minister at West Rox- 
bury, and Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered a 
Phi Beta Kappa oration at Cambridge. Mr. 
Adams regards these as very important dates. 
They have not been so considered by modern 
historical writers of Massachusetts, who were 
all Unitarians, Palfrey, Peabody, Bancroft, 
Quincy, Savage, Upharn, Deane, Ellis, and 
Eliot, and no one of them ever suggested that 
Massachusetts needed salvation. The theory 
that she had fallen from grace, and needed to be 
brought out of the miry clay by politics and 
Unitarianism, is an original conception of Mr. 
Adams. 

The just and appreciative treatment of In- 
crease and Cotton Mather is a creditable and 
surprising feature of the book. It is surpris- 
ing, because it has been the fashion of " lib- 
eral " writers to speak of them and their writ- 
ings in disparaging and abusive terms. This 
tirade of malignity began in 1825 when James 
Savage edited Winthrop's Journal ; and was 
kept up, one writer copying another, for nearly 



fifty years. Cotton Mather's biographer, Mr. 
Peabody, wrote in 1840 : " The ' Magnalia ' 
has fallen into disrepute with those who read 
for instruction. Its value is not to be esti- 
mated by its usefulness, but by the more doubt- 
ful standard of oddity and age. His works now 
sleep in repose where even the antiquary sel- 
dom disturbs them." 

Mr. Adams, on the other hand, regards the 
" Magnalia " as one of the pinnacles of Amer- 
ican literature ; and to-day the writings of the 
Mathers are more sought for by collectors and 
libraries in this country and in Europe, and 
bring higher prices, than those of any other 
family which has lived in America. 

Even so judicious and usually fair writer as 
Dr. Palfrey characterized, in 1846, the " Mag- 
nalia " as " a historical medley which is be- 
neath criticism in any point of view." In 1869, 
the Doctor, in my presence, apologized for the 
use of the above expression as being unjust ; 
" but," he said, " it was the fashion of the day 
when it was uttered." About twenty-five years 
ago the tide turned, and since then there have 
been writers who could speak well of the Math- 
ers. No one has spoken for them more justly 
and effectively than Mr. Adams. He cites the 
conduct of the Mathers when innoculation for 
small-pox was introduced into Boston, in 1721, 
by Dr. Boylston, and the physicians opposed 
it on theological grounds as impiety and re- 
sisting the providence of God. He says : 

"To the everlasting credit of Increase and Cotton 
Mather one the President of Harvard College they 
rose above the grovelling stage of superstition, and faced 
the storm of popular odium. The excitement was great, 
and Dr. Boylston bore witness to the fact that without 
the great moral support of the Mathers, he would have 
been obliged to succumb. As it was, an attempt was 
made on the life of Cotton Mather; while his father, 
then eighty-three years of age, closed his long life of 
literary activity by writing a pamphlet showing that in- 
noculation against small-pox was not only scientific, but 
had been blessed of God." 

On the literary merit of their writings, Mr. 
Adams says : 

" From Cotton Mather to Nathaniel Hawthorne is a 
long stride; but there is no immediate stepping-stone. 
The 'Magnalia' was published in 1702, and 'Twice- 
Told Tales ' in 1837 the one a boulder, the other a 
flower and between them is nothing ! This Haw- 
thorne himself recognized; and to the 'Magnalia' he 
instinctively went back as to a store-house of material. 
So did Longfellow; for, with the possible exception of 
Dr. Franklin's Autobiography, the intermediate 135 
years of Massachusetts history left absolutely nothing 
to be classified as general literature which posterity has 
cared to preserve." 

With the above sweeping statement as to 
the dearth of literature in Massachusetts from

CROSSIXG THE COXTIXEXT.* 

The most influential as well as the most pic- 
turesque factor in American history has been 
the steady march of civilization across the con- 
tinent. Columbus opened the way for the pro- 
cess, and it has been going on ever since. But 
in a bulletin of the Superintendent of the Cen- 
sus for 1890 a century after the taking of the 
first census, four centuries after the discovery 
of the continent occurs this significant an- 
nouncement: "Up to and including 1880, the 
country had a frontier of settlement ; but at 
present the unsettled area has been so broken 
into by isolated bodies of settlement that there 
can hardly be said to be a frontier line." This 
marks the close of the first period of American 
history, and inaugurates a new era. The con- 
tinent is crossed by settlement. 

It is peculiarly appropriate that there should 
have been given to the world at this time a 
reprint, in elaborate and sumptuous form, of 
the history of the Lewis and Clark expedition 
to the sources of the Missouri, across the Rocky 
Mountains, and down the Columbia to the Pa- 
cific, in the years 1804-6. The expedition was 
the first to cross the continent within the limits 
of the United States. It was connected with 
some of the most influential processes in Amer- 
ican history. Jefferson, who gave to us the

ted, was its projector. It grew out of plans 
for the advancement of the fur trade. The 
fur trader had, from the days of Champlain 
and La Salle, been the path-finder for civiliza- 
tion. In 1786, while the Annapolis Conven- 
tion was discussing the navigation of the Poto- 
mac, Jefferson wrote to Washington, from Paris, 
inquiring about the best place for a canal be- 
tween the Ohio and the Great Lakes. This 
was in promotion of a project of Ledyard, a 
Connecticut Yankee, who was then in Paris en- 
deavoring to interest a wealthy business house 
there in the fur trade of the far West. Sa 
great an interest did Jefferson take in the plan 
that he secured from the house a promise that, 
if it undertook the scheme, the depot of supply 
should be at Alexandria, Virginia. After the 
failure of the negotiations of Ledyard, Jeffer- 
son proposed to him to cross Russia and take 
ship to Nootka Sound, and thence return to 
the Atlantic coast by way of the Missouri. The 
plan fell through, and Ledyard died while ex- 
ploring the Nile ; but the project suggested the 
Lewis and Clark expedition. This expedition 
was instructed to investigate the possibilities of 
the fur traffic and the feasibility of a trans- 
continental trading route. But before this ex- 
pedition was planned, Jefferson had proposed 
to the American Philosophical Society that a 
subscription should be raised to enable Captain 
Lewis (afterwards Jefferson's private secretary} 
to cross the continent with a single companion. 
The person selected was Andre Michaux, a 
French botanist. The expedition failed because 
of the recall of Michaux by the French minis- 
ter. Dr. Coues suspects that this was due to 
Jefferson's suspicions that the botanist was a 
spy in the secret service of the French govern- 
ment. If the editor had consulted the Clark 
Manuscripts, in the Library of the Wisconsin 
State Historical Society, he would have been 
able to state from Michaux's own letters that he 
was actually intriguing, on behalf of Genet, with 
General George Rogers Clark, the conqueror 
of the Illinois country, who desired to expa- 
triate himself, and who accepted a French com- 
mission to conquer the mouth of the Mississippi 
from Spain. Dr. Coues makes no effort to un- 
tangle the web of conspiracy that was spread 
over the West at this time ; but surely it is a 
striking fact that William Clark, one of the 
leaders of the expedition whose history Dr. 
Coues edits, was brother of the man whose in- 
trigues with Michaux aroused Jefferson's sus- 
picions, and frustrated this earlier project. 
The personnel of the expedition is of fur-

ther interest, since its epitomizes the factors 
of Western advance. In the crossing of the 
continent the buffalo's trail followed the easiest 
lines of advance, the Indian followed the buf- 
falo, the trapper and fur trader followed the 
Indian, and the backwoods farmers and cattle- 
raisers followed the trapper. Through Cum- 
berland Gap in the Alleghenies, and through 
South Pass in the Rockies, went the same pro- 
cession. Now, when Lewis and Clark took 
their party to the Pacific they took with them 
an Indian woman, a captive from the Rocky 
Mountains, whose services as guide and inter- 
preter form one of the most picturesque ele- 
ments of the story ; they took French voya- 
geurs, or water-men, descendants of that lively 
adventurous throng whose canoeing songs had 
echoed along the forest-girt shores of the Great 
Lakes in the days of the old regime ; there were 
also backwoodsmen, with William Clark at 
their head a man of the hardy stock that had 
won Kentucky and ousted the British from the 
Illinois country, and who had himself fought 
with Wayne in the campaign that gave the far- 
mer the Northwest. Tidewater Virginia was 
personified in Captain Lewis ; and among the 
party were Yankees from New Hampshire and 
Vermont. Representatives of the Middle States 
were also there. Thus there marched in this 
company the elements that opened the West, 
and with them were representatives of those sec- 
tions that struggled for dominance there ; while 
in the person of York, Captain Lewis's negro, 
there passed through Missouri, and on to Ore- 
gon, the herald of many woes the prototype 
of Dred Scott. As the expedition ascended the 
Missouri it passed La Charette creek, the Mis- 
souri home of Daniel Boone ; and Clark's map 
of 1814 notes Boone's Salt Works. Thus the 
mind runs back to the history of this famous 
frontiersman, who in the first half of the eight- 
eenth century followed the traders from his 
Pennsylvania home along the Great Valley to 
the Yadkin in North Carolina ; next, led by 
traders' reports, crossed the Alleghenies and be- 
came the pioneer of Kentucky, and from there 
had gone to Missouri. His son was one of 
the earliest trappers of the Rocky Mountain 
passes, and camped on the site of Denver when 
it was a wilderness ; Kit Carson's mother was 
a Boone. In how few names can the history 
of the crossing of the continent be written ! 
When Clark returned to Saint Louis, one of 
his first letters, describing the passes he had 
discovered, was to his brother George Rogers, 
conqueror of the Illinois country and intriguer 



with France for the Mississippi Valley. Per- 
haps we cannot ask Dr. Coues to elucidate the 
broader historical phases of the expedition, but 
he should have reprinted this letter, so dra- 
matic in its bearings and so admirable in its 
resume of the expedition. It is to be regretted 
that the Doctor occasionally indulges himself 
in such remarkable lucubrations as this com- 
ment on the fact that the explorers named two 
streams " Wisdom " and " Philanthrophy " re- 
spectively, in commemoration of Jefferson's 
character : 

" To complete this system of geographical ethics, they 
should have discontinued the name of Jefferson for the 
main stream, and called this Paine river, whose main 
forks should have been Religion and Common Sense; 
for Thomas Paine's soul flowed into Jefferson's, bearing 
a precious quality of spiritual reasonableness, which in- 
formed and filled the mind of the greatest statesman 
America ever produced. What we owe to Jefferson is 
history what Jefferson owed to Paine is the very 
mystery of godlikeness. It is well to keep the reputed 
paternity of our country before the common people by 
the name of Washington, and uphold William Tell 
among the simple Swiss; but Washington's intellect 
shrinks out of sight before Jefferson's, and Jefferson's 
dwarfs in comparison with Paine's. Washington whipped 
some average British soldiery ; Jefferson was more than 
a match for Napoleon Bonaparte ; he gave us more than 
half our country with a stroke of his pen, without spill- 
ing a drop of blood; and the whole of our country has 
grown up on principles enunciated from the French jail 
where Thomas Paine lay languishing, dreaming dreams 
that we have awakened to realize." 

Nevertheless, it must be said that Dr. Coues 
has the devotion of an enthusiast, that he sat- 
isfies all the requirements of a careful bibliog- 
rapher and a sympathetic and well qualified 
editor of the geographical and natural history 
material of the volumes, and that he has given 
minute and apparently careful study to the 
manuscript journals which have fallen into his 
hands. The editorial notes, which quote the 
original words of the explorers, from which Bid- 
die wrote the narrative here reprinted, afford 
us glimpses of what Dr. Coues calls " an unex- 
ampled curiosity in literature." It is certainly 
to be hoped that Dr. Coues will at some day 
reprint the original text of the explorers, and 
that he will make use of the William Clark 
papers in the Library of the State Historical 
Society of Wisconsin. This will enable him 
to cast additional light on one of the two ex- 
plorers. He has already made a good begin- 
ning in his memoirs of Lewis and Clark which 
introduce the volumes.

dents and "hair-breadth 'scapes." The tur-

floods, the grizzlies, and the Indians, were 
often likely to have brought the leaders to an 
untimely end. Aside from the picturesque in- 
cidents, and the information of value to the 
geographer and naturalist, the volumes contain 
pictures of the Indian life of the farthest West 
that are of value to the student of ethnology 
and primitive institutions. The travellers were 
experts in Indian management and in knowl- 
edge of Indian character, and they occupied 
their winter waits by writing descriptions of 
the tribes they met. It is noteworthy, how- 
ever, that even in the remotest wilds they met 
no Indians unmodified by acquaintance with 
Europeans. As early as the beginning of this 
century, it was too late to study Indian life in 
its unmodified form. Nevertheless these chap- 
ters are among the permanently valuable fea- 
tures of the work. FREDERICK J. TURNER.

son. Such proclamations have not been uncommon 
during the past ten years, and the series of New 
Poets thus heralded, from the late James Thomp- 
son to Mr. William Watson, has included a number 
of names. In almost all the cases, however, these 
poets have shared the fate of the novae known to 
astronomers, and their fame has been hardly more 
that that conferred by the admiration of a coterie. 
We should, indeed, hesitate to admit that a New 
Poet, in the serious sense of that term, has arisen 
among men of English speech since Rossetti, in 
1870, published $he contents of that famous disin- 
terred manuscript. That the performance of Mr. 
Francis Thompson, whose poems are now somewhat 
sumptuously put forth, is of such a character as to 
lift its author above the minor poets that swarm in 
our day and generation we see no reason to allow. 
In the first place, it exhibits a perversity of man- 
ner that equals Browning and Mr. George Mere- 
dith at their worst, and that sometimes recalls the 
more extravagant imaginings of Blake. It is full 
of puzzles, and it evidently selects wprds (such as 
trepidant, purpurate, and thurifer) for their mere 
oddity. This alone would be an obstacle in the way 
of general acceptance. But this is not all, for the 
work is weighted with false rhymes (stir and hair, 
able and babble), bad grammar (' must have took," 
" my hand hath shook"), and cacophonies, of which 

" In statelier state thou us'dst to go" 
is one example out of many. We quote a charac- 
teristic stanza : 

" Dream-dispensing face of hers ! 
Ivory port which loosed upon me 

Wings, I wist, 

Whose amethyst 
Trepidations have forgone me, 
Hesper's filmy traffickers." 

This sort of thing is ingenious, but, when its slight 
meaning has been worked out by the intellect, the 
heart remains untouched. It is the sort of thing 
that Mr. George Meredith has been doing, in both 
verse and prose, for many years. But we may say 
per contra that Mr. Thompson, like Mr. Meredith, 
has lapses into a more natural manner. He can 
even, upon occasion, sing as simple and sweet a song 
as " Daisy," from which we must do him the justice 
to quote: 

" Oh, there were flowers in Storrington 

On the turf and on the spray ; 
But the sweetest flower on Sussex hills 
Was the Daisy-flower that day. 

" Her beauty smoothed earth's furrowed face ! 

She gave me tokens three : 
A look, a word of her winsome mouth, 
And a wild raspberry. 

" A berry red, a guileless look, 

A still word, strings of sand ! 
And yet they made my wild, wild heart 
Fly down to her little hand. 

" For standing artless as the air, 

And candid as the skies, 
She took the berries with her hand, 
And the love with her sweet eyes." 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



83 



To do Mr. Thompson entire justice, we must also 
make an extract from " A Fallen Yew," a poem in 
which his imaginative powers are at their best, yet 
wherein expression does not go far beyond what is 
legitimate. 

" It seemed corrival of the world's great prime, 
Made to un-edge the scythe of Time, 
And last with stateliest rhyme. 

*' No tender Dryad ever did indue 
That rigid chiton of rough yew, 
To fret her white flesh through : 

" But some god like to those grim Asgard lords, 
Who walk the fables of the hordes 
From Scandinavian fjords, 

" Upheaved its stubborn girth, and raised unriven, 
Against the whirl-blast and the levin, 
Defiant arms to Heaven. 

" When doom puffed out the stars, we might have said, 
It would decline its heavy head, 
And see the world to bed." 

If these two latter extracts were representative, 
rather than exceptional, it might almost be said of 
their author that he had in him the making of a 
New Poet. 

A lyrical utterance finer and truer than may be 
detected in Mr. Thompson's verse inspires the sheaf 
of songs just given to the public by Mr. Robert 
Bridges. His exquisite song of " Nightingales " has 
caught something of the music of the greater poets. 

" Beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come, 
And bright in the fruitful valleys the streams wherefrom 

Ye learn your song : 

Where are those starry woods ? might I wander there 
Among the flowers, which in that heavenly air 

Bloom the year long ! 

" Nay, barren are those mountains and spent the streams : 
Our song is the voice of desire, that haunts our dreams, 

A throe of the heart, 

Whose pining visions dim, forbidden hopes profound, 
No dying cadence nor long sigh can sound, 

For all our art. 

" Alone aloud in the raptured ears of men 
We pour our dark nocturnal secret ; and then, 

As night is withdrawn 

From these sweet-springing meads and bursting boughs of May, 
Dream while the innumerable choirs of day 

Welcome the dawn." 

This is not quite the careless rapture of the Eliza- 
bethans, although others among the songs of Mr. 
Bridges have nearly caught that. And " The Hu- 
mours of the Court," the play that fills the greater 
part of his volume, is curiously Elizabethan both in 
spirit and treatment. What memories of Fletcher 
or of Massinger are evoked by such a passage as 

"Oh, I could sit 

And sigh beneath that window all the night ; 
Is there not wondrous softness in the thought, 
That she one loves is sleeping ? " 

Mr. Bridges has based his play upon Calderon's 
" El Secreto d Voces," and pieced it out with a 
scene from Lope. But the process has been trans- 
mutation, not translation. 

With increasing frequency, of recent years, the 



Canadian Muse has brought its quota of song to the 
collections of current verse that we have had occa- 
sion to pass under review. The group of volumes 
characterized in the present article has also its Cana- 
dian representatives, first among which we may 
mention " In Dreamland, and Other Poems," by 
Mr. Thomas O'Hagan. Mr. O'Hagan's allegiance, 
however, is not wholly given to the Dominion, for 
Ireland, as well as Canada, claims his tribute, and 
the sense of a divided duty is ever with him. So 
we find upon one page such lines as these : 
" Dear native land, we are but one 

From ocean unto ocean ; 

1 The sun that tints the Maple Leaf ' 

Smiles with a like devotion 

On Stadacona's fortress height, 

On Grand Pr4's storied valley, 

And that famed tide whose peaceful shore 

Was rocked in battle sally, 
My native land ! " 

While on another is expressed the hope 

" That Ireland, dear old Ireland, 

Should evermore be free, 
And her patriot sons in union 
Drive the Saxon o'er the sea." 

The effort to " weave in one garland the Maple and 
Shamrock" does not seem to result in a very sat- 
isfactory sort of patriotism. Nor does it result 
(which is more to our purpose) in verses that rise 
above a low level of the commonplace. 

Mr. Bliss Carman, although a sojourner in "these 
States," must be reckoned with the interesting group 
of Canadian poets, and takes a high place among 
them. We have more than once had occasion to 
mention Mr. Carman's work, although his first col- 
lected volume is now put forth. The volume is not 
entirely representative of the writer for the reason 
thus stated by him : " It seemed better to bring to- 
gether between the same covers only those pieces of 
work which happened to be in the same key, rather 
than to publish a larger book of more uncertain 
aim." This restraint was perhaps wise, although it 
makes us miss for the present certain pieces of more 
enduring value than any here published. The note 
of the present collection is lyrical, and the key is 
predominantly minor. From "The Vagabonds," 
one of the strongest of these poems, we may make 
a characteristic selection: 

" In the beginning God made man 

Out of the wandering dust, men say ; 
And in the end his life shall be 

A wandering wind and blown away. 

" We are the vagabonds of time, 

Willing to let the world go by, 
With joy supreme, with heart sublime, 
And valor in the kindling eye. 

" We have forgotten where we slept, 

And guess not where we sleep to-night, 
Whether among the lonely hills 
In the pale streamer's ghostly light 

" We shall lie down and hear the frost 
Walk in the dead leaves restlessly, 
Or somewhere on the iron coast 
Learn the oblivion of the sea.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



" It matters not. And yet I dream 

Of dreams fulfilled and rest somewhere 
Before this restless heart is stilled 
And all its fancies blown to air. 

" Had I my will ! . . . The sun burns down 
And something plucks my garment's hem ; 
The robins in their faded brown 
Would lure me to the south with them. 

" 'Tis time for vagabonds to make 
The nearest inn. Far on I hear 
The voices of the Northern hills 
Gather the vagrants of the year." 

These verses have a haunting quality from which 
there is no escape. They are also felicitous in 
their choice of epithet and musical in their verbal 
arrangement, which cannot be said of all Mr. Car- 
man's pieces. A poem in some respects stronger and 
more finely imaginative than the one just mentioned 
is called " Pulvis et Umbra," yet it is not a little 
marred by words to which a forced employment is 
given. But the author has certainly caught the 
true poetic accent, although he stammers now and 
then in its use. When at his best, as the above ex- 
tract shows, he speaks in his own tongue, and from 
the heart. His future work will be awaited with 
interest by all who concern themselves with the cur- 
rent development of pure literature. 

" Behind the Veil " is a poem found among the 
manuscripts of the late James De Mille, and now 
given to the public by Professor Archibald Mac- 
mechan. It appears in rather sumptuous quarto 
form, with an etched portrait of the author. It tells 
us how the author, in a dream or trance, "saw the 
Vision of the World, and all the wonder" not 
that should be, but that has been. In other words, 
the scroll of history was rolled back before his gaze. 
We quote one stanza as an example of the form and 
spirit of the poem. 

" Golden gleams on fields of azure, 
Worlds on worlds arose in Space, 
Numbers more than thought or measure ; 
There each Sun careering onward held its planets in their 

place ; 

Flashed the meteor ; flared the comet ; speeding in its head- 
long race." 

The work is a rhapsody upon a familiar plan, and 
of doubtful poetic value. 

Mr. C. H. Crandall publishes a volume of " Way- 
side Music " that is notable for clear technique 
and reasonably successful accomplishment of modest 
aims. It is marred occasionally by commonplace 
phrases, by hackneyed rhythmical devices, and by 
strained expressions (such as " yachts of God " for 
clouds) ; but the general impression is pleasing. 
"The Golden Age" is a pretty lyric. 

" My love and I laugh o'er the page. 

That tells the varied story 
How love ran in the Golden Age 
We care not for its glory. 

" Idly we read how earthly maids 

Entangled Jove, the mighty, 
Or how Adonis in the glades 
Played with fair Aphrodite. 



" Pan the sweet river-nymph may woo, 

Pygmalion, Galatea ; 
Our love is just as sweet and true 
As theirs by blue -<Egea. 

" Nor lacks it the enchanting power 
That blends divine with human ; 
My love will change at any hour 
To goddess or to woman ! 

" Thus love's eternal heritage 

Illumes our modern portals. 

Cupid and Psyche know not age, 

And we, too, are immortals." 

Mr. Crandall, it will be remembered, is the editor 
of an excellent selection of American sonnets, pre- 
faced by a historical essay upon the sonnet ; and it 
is consequently not surprising that the best of hia 
work should be in that form of verse. Better, in 
our judgment, than " Waiting " and " Adelaide Neil- 
son " the two sonnets selected for his own collec- 
tion are " Woman," " Sleep's Conquest," " The 
New Year," and " Sunset on the Palisades." We 
quote the first of these four : 

" Fairer than all the fantasies that dart 

Adown the dreams of our most favored sleep, 
Thy lovely form since Eden's day doth keep 

The constant pattern of a perfect art ! 

Yet more do we admire thy better part, 
The spirit strong to smile when others weep ; 
And well know we who sail life's ocean deep 

There is no haven like a woman's heart. 

" Thus, often weary ere the victory 's won, 

Tired with my task, my head I fain would lay 

In some good lady's lap as did the Dane, 
And watch the action of the world go on, 
Knowing 'tis but a play within a play, 
The fleeting portion of an endless plan." 

It is unfortunate that one defective rhyme should 
have crept into this otherwise admirable poem. 

" In Various Moods " is a thin volume of vers de 
societe with a tendency toward exotic metrical forms. 
Some of them are very pretty, a good example ^be- 
ing the roundel " A Shower of Gold." 

" A shower of gold ? Let none declare 
He would not try to catch and hold 
Some part, if Fate with him would share 
A shower of gold. 

"Not like frail Danae's of old, 
But sunlight-clear, divinely fair, 
A joy and glory to enfold. 

" For sordid pelf he would not care, 
Who had the fortune to behold 
One glimpse of her (my lady's) hair, 
A shower of gold." 

We must not fail to quote a trifle called " At "the 
Flower Show." 

'' ' Du hist wie eine Blume," 1 
I whispered in her ear. 
Say, wilt thou grace my garden, 

maid, most sweet and dear ? 

" Full soft and low her answer : 
' O reckless youth, beware ! 
Alas ! I'm not an orchid ; 

1 cannot live on air ! ' " 

A sense of rhythm so faulty as to make many of 
the verses read like prose is the one noticeable de- 
fect of this volume.

A second edition has been published of the poems 
of Daniel Dawson, and the recent death of the 
writer makes a few words of characterization ap- 
propriate at this time. His verse is strained, arti- 
ficial, over-sensuous, and pays tribute to strange 
gods ; yet it has interludes of musical utterance 
that seize the attention, and imaginative passages 
that cause at least a momentary thrill. Over it all, 
however, is the trail of bohemianism, and its pas- 
sion is more theatrical than real. The following 
stanza is from a piece in which, emulous of Brown- 
ing, the writer discourses of Childe Roland and the 
Dark Tower : 

" It peers somewhere between the pointed hills, 

Builded of old by Merlin in the waste ; 
The giant there his fateful ward fulfills, 

Until the chosen of the world shall haste, 
Through wood and wold, o'er fell and field and fen, 
To bide the battle for the sons of men." 

There is much excellent stuff in Dawson's work, but 
it is crudely presented, and the light that falls upon 
it is garish. 

A selection of the poems of the late Thomas 
William Parsons has recently been published, and 
is one of the most welcome books of the season. 
The original editions have long been out of print, 
and many of the poems have never before been pub- 
lished at all in the strict sense, or at least have 
made but a furtive previous appearance in the col- 
umns of newspapers or the pages of magazines. 
The new collection is far from complete, but it is 
representative, and includes most of the author's 
best work. We should say all, did we not look in 
vain for " Saint Peray," which should have been 
included in the scantiest of selections, and the trans- 
lation of Manzoni's " Cinque Maggio " ode, which 
should have accompanied the " Proem," in spite of 
the rule barring out other than original work. Com- 
paring the collection with the volume of 1854 (the 
only one that was published in this country), we 
find it to contain nearly twice the amount of mat- 
ter and more than twice the number of pieces. 
There are great inequalities in these poems, and it 
is astonishing how trivial the poet of " Paradisi 
Gloria " and the verses " On a Bust of Dante " 
could be at times. But Parsons at his best was a 
writer not likely to be forgotten. He was a poet 
for poets rather than for the public, and his most 
finished work has much of the quality that also made 
Landor appeal rather to the select than to the gen- 
eral audience. " The hermit thrush of singers " he 
is happily styled by the young fellow-poet who has 
paid a graceful tribute to his memory. Besides the 
comparison with Landor, comparisons with Gray 
and with Collins have been suggested, and are not 
without justification. Speaking of Landor, we note 
that the " Epistle " addressed to that poet is now 
entitled a " Letter from America to a Friend in 
Tuscany." We have always been puzzled by this 
poem, with its familiar 

" Dear Walter, in our Eton days," 
and its statement, 



" Since thou and I pursued our mountain way, 
Twenty Decembers have disrobed the trees." 

If this is to be taken literally, the " mountain way" 
in question was pursued by a youth of fifteen and 
a sexagenarian. And even then the Eton puzzle is 
unexplained. 

A companion volume to the " Poems," and the 
more precious boon of the two, represents, in the 
words of a publishers' note, " the great poetic pas- 
sion of the man." In other words, it gives us 
the translation by Dr. Parsons of the Sacred Song 
of Dante. The " Inferno " is complete, and the 
" Purgatorio " nearly so, but of the " Paradiso " we 
have only a few fragments. The cantos of the sec- 
ond Canticle have been collected from scattered 
numbers of " The Catholic World," to which they 
were from time to time contributed during a long 
period of years. Professor C. E. Norton provides 
the volume with a preface, and Miss Guiney writes 
a " Memorial Sketch " which is sympathetic enough, 
but stilted in expression. It is curious, indeed, that 
the simple, direct, and almost classical style of the 
translator should have so appealed to an editor who 
could write: "An unrevised life-labor, plucked for 
the public while yet green upon the bough, bears 
itself meekly, and hopes for consideration." But 
Miss Guiney's sketch betrays flashes of insight for 
which we should be grateful ; such, for example, 
as the following : " Above all, Dr. Parsons can be 
trusted, with a touch so light it is often unsuspected, 
to dispel a vagueness or insert some little clarifica- 
tion, and to deal firmly with paraphrase where the 
prodigious force of the Tuscan idiom is such that 
the best English threatens to break under it." As 
for the translation, which usually has the form of 
Gray's " Elegy " except for the division into stan- 
zas, Professor Norton is safe in saying that " as a 
rhymed version in English of the ' Divine Comedy ' 
it has no superior." We are inclined to go still 
further, and to claim for it at least parity with, and 
possibly superiority over, the best of the unrhymed 
metrical versions. It certainly produces the effect 
of an English poem, as Longfellow's bare transla- 
tion does not, and this without venturing as far as 
Gary in the direction of paraphrase. As Professor 
Norton says, " Without knowledge of the original, 
one may read it with ease and pleasure, and with 
little sense of any hampering conformities to a for- 
eign original. There are many parts in which the 
translation reaches so high a level of natural poetry 
that the reader may readily forget that the English 
poet is following an Italian model." As an exquis- 
ite example of this we may take the meeting with 
Beatrice (Purg. XXX., 67-75): 

" Although the veil which from her forehead fell, 
Girt by that frondage of Minerva's tree, 
Suffered me not to see her features well, 
Queenly she looked, and yet upbraided me, 
Continuing thus, with sweet restraint of style 
As 't were she kept her warmer words behind : 
' Behold me well. The one I was erewhile 
Good sooth I am : I am thy Beatrice ! 
So, hast thou deigned then to approach the hill ? 
Didst thou not know man findeth here his bliss.' "

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



This, beyond a doubt, is good English poetry, but 
it is not quite Dante. Besides the expansion of the 
verse 

" Guardami ben ; ben son, ben son Beatrice " 

into two, which even the the felicitous " good sooth " 
does not justify, there are, as Professor Norton 
says, qualities of essence, of poetic nature, of style, 
and of tone, that differentiate the version from the 
original. Or, taking one of Matthew Arnold's 
chosen examples of the grand style in Dante (Inf. 
XVI., 61-3) : 

" Lascio lo fele, e vo pei dolci pomi 

Promessi a me per lo verace Duca ; 

Mafino al centre pria convien ch'io tomi," 

and turning to read in Parsons : 

" Leaving the gall, I seek the pleasant fruit 
Promised to me by this my faithful Guide ; 
But to the centre first must sink my foot," 

we are confronted by the same subtle differentia- 
tion. The style of the translation is pleasing, har- 
monious, and dignified, yet it is not the grand style. 
But we doubt if anyone will ever come nearer than 
Parsons did to a reproduction in English of the es- 
sential qualities of Dante's manner. 

Mr. G. A. Greene's volume of translations from 
the "Italian Lyrists of To-Day" is a work of ex- 
ceptional value, both on account of its biographical 
and critical notices of thirty-four among the Italian 
poets now living, and on account of the remarkable 
faithfulness and high poetic quality of the transla- 
tions offered. The work begins where the " Modern 
Italian Poets " of Mr. Ho wells leaves off, and there 
is no name common to the two works. Mr. Greene's 
lengthy introduction speaks of the decline of Ital- 
ian literature during the period between 1860 and 
1870, and of its remarkable resurgence during the 
past quarter-century. He accounts for the decline 
by saying that literature had been so long in pol- 
itics that, after the achievement of national unity, 
it had lost the power to deal with anything else. 
Romanticism, moreover, had spent its force, and 
the time was not quite ripe for the classical re- 
action. When that reaction came, with Signor 
Carducci as its leader, it had things its own way, 
and " saved literature in Italy." This poet, of 
course, more than any other, gets attention in Mr. 
Greene's volume, and his revival of classical metres 
is discussed with much intelligence. The matter is 
so important that we quote Mr. Greene's quotation 
from one of Signor Cavducci's disciples : " We have 
no quantity ; but we can render in Italian verse the 
sound of Latin verses, as it appears to strike our 
1 barbarous ' ears. That is to say : since we, when 
reading Horace, hear in his odes our own five-syl- 
lable, seven-syllable, nine-syllable, and hendecasyl- 
labic metres, so we can construct, by means of these 
metres, strophes which apparently correspond to his. 
For instance: 

' Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume,' 

sounds to our Italian ears as though it were com- 
posed of two quinarii, the first simple, the second 
sdrucciolo ; and therefore for 



' Eheu fugaces | Postume, P6stume,' 
Carducci writes 

' Oh quei fanali 1 c<5me s'inse'guono.' " 

These innovations have had to fight their way, and 
they have won acceptance but for what they really 
pretend to be (as explained above), not for what 
their opponents have misrepresented them as claim- 
ing. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and 
the proof of the poem is in its effect upon the intel- 
lectual palate. The following is undoubtedly poetry : 

" deviata verde solitudine 
Lungi dal rumor degli uomini ! 
Qui due con noi divini amici vengono 
Vino ed amore Lidia," 

and it remains little less than poetry in Mr. Greene's 
" O now so long desired, thou verdurous solitude, 
Far from all rumor of mankind ! 
Hither we come companioned by two friends divine, 
By wine and love, Lydia." 

Here is an example of the translator's Carduccian 
sapphics : 

" Cypresses solemn stand on Monte Mario ; 

Luminous, quiet is the air around them ; 

They watch the Tiber through the misty meadows 

Wandering voiceless." 

The translation from which we make this extract 
could not easily be equalled. " Stecchetti " and the 
young Gabriele d'Annunzio are the poets next in 
importance to the one just discussed, and get a large 
share of Mr. Greene's attention. His versions of 
poems by the latter are exquisitely done, and should 
be reprinted did space permit, as well as the " Pre- 
lude " from "Stecchetti's" " Postuma," "The Ban- 
quet " of Signor Pascoli," and the " Florentine Mem- 
ories" of Signor Marradi. But Mr. Greene's book 
must tell the rest of the stoiy. 

Professor Goldwin Smith's "Bay Leaves" is a 
small volume of translations from ten Latin poets ; 
Lucretius, Catullus, Ovid, Horace, and Martial get- 
ting most of the translator's attention. "The trans- 
lator of Latin poetry," says Professor Smith, " has 
the comfort of knowing that he is separated from 
his authors by no chasm of thought and sentiment, 
such as that which separates the translator from 
Homer, or even from JEschylus." This is particu- 
larly true of the Latin poets of the Empire, and 
hardly less true of Lucretius. The translations are 
free, smooth, and tasteful. With Horace, " whom, 
for some occult reason, one loves the better the older 
one grows," the translator has been peculiarly hap- 
py, as in the Otium divos rogat 

" For ease the weary seaman prays 

On the wild ocean, tempest tost, 
When guiding stars withhold their rays, 
When pales the moon in cloud-wrack lost. 

" For ease the Median archers sigh, 

For ease the Thracian warrior bold ; 

But ease, my friend, nor gems can bay, 

Nor purple robes, nor mighty gold." 

Two companion volumes, each of twice the thickness 
of " Bay Leaves," are devoted to the same transla- 
tor's experiments with Greek tragedy in English

blank verse. The choruses have, as a rule, been 
avoided, and a prefatory note displays a curious 
lack of feeling for the poetic beauty of the lyrical 
passages in the tragedies. One of the volumes gives 
extracts from JEschylus and Sophocles, "The Sup- 
pliants " being the only play not represented. In 
the other we have scenes from twelve of the plays 
of Euripides. 

Miss Swanwick, whose translation of the first part 
of "Faust" was published more than forty years 
ago, now offers the work to the public in a revised 
form, changed particularly in the lyrical passages, 
to many of which the double rhymes have been re- 
stored. The work in its present form is highly 
creditable, although still inferior to Taylor's, as 
may be illustrated by the Chorus, " Hat der Begra- 
bene," a crucial test. Miss Swanwick gives us: 

" He whom we mourned as dead, 
Living and glorious, 
From the dark grave hath fled, 
O'er death victorious ; 
Almost creative bliss 
Waits on his growing powers ; 
Ah ! Him on earth we miss ; 
Sorrow and grief are ours." 

Taylor did much better when he translated : 
" Has He victoriously 
Burst from the vaulted 
Grave, and ail-gloriously 
Now sits exalted. 
Is He, in glow of birth, 
Rapture creative near ? 
Ah ! to the woe of earth 
Still are we native here." 

The Retzsch outline illustrations appear with this 
volume, and are not a happy addition. 

Gottfried Kinkel, whose "Tanagra" has been 
put into English verse by Mrs. Frances Hellman, 
was one of the more important literary personalities 
of his time, and has a peculiar interest for Ameri- 
cans as the friend and fellow-revolutionist of Herr 
Carl Schurz. Both were combatants on the side of 
liberty in 1849, and both were captured by the 
Prussians and imprisoned at Rastatt. Herr Schurz 
made his escape through a sewer soon after his cap- 
ture, arid fled to Switzerland. Secretly returning 
in the following year, he aided Kinkel to escape, 
and both took ship for England. Kinkel remained 
in England for some fifteen years, visiting the United 
States in 1851, and, in 1866, accepted a post at Zu- 
rich, where he lived until his death in 1882. In an 
age when Germany has produced only minor poets 
he was one of the most popular of them all, and 
the list of his productions is lengthy, including not 
only poems, but stories and contributions to the lit- 
erature of aesthetics. " Tanagra," which is an epic- 
idyll upon a Greek theme, was the last and the 
ripest of his poems. Mrs. Hellman's translation, 
which is in couplets, produces a slightly pedestrian 
effect, but is pleasing. It is published in gift-book 
guise, with illustrations by Mr. E. H. Blashfield, in 
which the artist does not seem to have been at his 
happiest. 



Of the gift-book type are also the two exquisite 
booklets which introduce the "Bibelot" series to 
the public. One of them, " Old World Lyrics," is 
a selection of translations, mostly from the French, 
by Mr. Andrew Lang and others. They are trans- 
lations such as Mr. Dobson's "Ars Victrix," Mr. 
Lang's versions of Ronsard, and Rossetti's render- 
ing of Villon's most famous ballad to be read 
almost as much for their own sake as for that of 
the originals. Two or three of the selections are of 
such a nature that the book cannot well be offered 
to the Young Person. "Songs of Adieu" is the 
other of these booklets, and proves to be a tasteful 
selection of valedictory and mortuary lyrics from a 
wide range of recent English writers. One Amer- 
ican, the late Paul H. Hayne, figures in the collec- 
tion. The book is particularly acceptable because 
it brings together a number of charming lyrics other- 
wise not easily accessible. 

We cannot better close this article than with a 
few words of praise for the new Cambridge edition 
of Longfellow's poems. The contents of six vol- 
umes of the Riverside edition (with some condensa- 
tion of the notes) are here put into a single volume 
of nearly seven hundred pages, and the result, from 
the mechanical point of view, is a masterpiece even 
among the publications of the house whence it issues. 
The paper is thin but opaque, the dimensions are 
excellent, and the cover is in faultless taste. The 
collection has a biography by Mr. Scudder, more 
than enough notes for most readers, and a chrono- 
logical list of the poems. It will doubtless remain 
for many years to come the standard one-volume 
edition of our most widely-read poet, and his friends 
could not have wished for his work a more satisfac- 
tory setting. The volume should find its way to 
every home in the land.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



A new and 
profound study 
of Goethe. 



Most writers, in the minds of most 
people, act as merely external influ- 
ences, and are, upon reflection, easily 
to be differentiated as such. But a few among the 
very greatest of writers appeal to the inmost con- 
sciousness ; their thought becomes incorporated with 
the very framework of the mental structure, woven 
in the very warp and woof of its fabric. This is 
particularly true if we make their acquaintance at 
the early age when introspection does not as yet 
largely enter into the mental process. Afterwards, 
we do not give these men their due ; their thought 
has become so indubitably our own that we cannot 
imagine it ever to have been something external to 
ourselves. The assimilation of Shakespeare, for ex- 
ample, by many generations of English-speaking peo- 
ple has been so complete that many men will read 
with mingled wonder and incredulity such a state- 
ment as that made by Mr. Ruskin when he says : 



88 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



" The intellectual measure of every man since born 
in the domains of creative thought may be assigned 
to him according to the degree in which he has been 
taught by Shakespeare." An influence almost com- 
parable with that of Shakespeare has been exerted 
upon the thought of the present century by Goethe, 
yet few among those whose thought has been shaped 
by the author of " Faust " and " Wilhelm Meister " 
could balance their account with Goethe off-hand. 
It is the peculiar merit of Mr. J. R. Seeley's " Goethe 
Reviewed after Sixty Years " (Roberts) that it helps 
us to realize the magnitude of our intellectual debt 
to Goethe, that it shows us how startlingly different 
some of our ideals might now have been had we not 
felt the contagion of his spirit, directly or indirectly. 
Mr. Seeley's book is a small one, but its analysis 
includes all the essentials. In this respect it reminds 
us of his " Napoleon the First," which it equals in 
weightiness. The author strikes deep when, for ex- 
ample, he says : " It is the strenuous energy with 
which Goethe enters into the battle of life, and fights 
there for a victory into which others may enter, that 
makes him great, that makes him the teacher of these 
later ages, this, and not some foppish pretension of 
being above it all, of seeing through it and despising 
it." And allied with the above passage is the fol- 
lowing pregnant suggestion, taken from a discussion 
of Goethe's struggle for self-culture : " Here is the 
refined form of selfishness of which Goethe has been 
so often accused ; and undoubtedly the phrase is one 
which will bear a selfish interpretation, just as a 
Christian may be selfish when he devotes himself to 
the salvation of his soul." These are words to be 
seriously weighed before passing judgment upon 
Goethe's life, or assuming to set forth its ethical 
implications. It would be difficult sufficiently to 
praise Mr. Seeley's essay for its insight, or for its 
philosophical setting forth of the meaning of Goethe's 
life and work. 

The use of book-plates, or book- 
ook-Varks labels, originated with Hans Igler in 

Germany sometime before the close 
of the fifteenth century. Albert Dttrer engraved a 
book-plate for one Bilibald Pirckheimer in 1524. 
Elizabeth Pindar was the first English woman to 
use a book-plate (1608), and another English wo- 
man, a Miss Jenkins, of Bath (1820), is the first 
known collector of these bibliographical curiosities. 
These particulars are well worth noting, now that 
the book-plate has arrived at a position of no small 
dignity. In France there is an Ex Libris Society, 
and this society publishes a Journal. England 
also has its Ex Libris Society, and we understand 
that America is threatened with a like invasion. It 
is a harmless mania, this collecting of book-tickets, 
at least so long as it does not mean the destruc- 
tion of books. Sir Leicester Warren (now Lord de 
Tabley) was the first Englishman to write a book 
on the subject, we believe, called " A Guide to the 
Study of Book Plates." We now have a work of 
liberal proportions, written by Mr. W. J. Hardy, 



entitled " Book-Plates," and published in the series 
of " Books about Books," imported by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. There are " styles <' in 
book-plates, as in furniture and book-bindings ; and 
to be au fait one should know how to discriminate 
as between the " Armorial," " Jacobean," " Chip- 
pendale," and " Allegoric" or " Symbolic." Some 
awkward blunders have been made, even in En- 
gland, in the selection of an armorial design; as, 
for instance, when the Countess-Dowager of Bath, 
being a widow, should have " borne her arms in a 
lozenge," but didn't. Mr. Hardy tells us he has 
aimed at giving in his handbook " an historic sketch, 
however unpretentious, of the different styles adopted 
in designing book-plates, from their first introduc- 
tion " down to the early years of the present cen- 
tury, "after which no distinctive style can be said 
to exist." In the work of modern designers he 
finds only a few noteworthy examples, but these 
form " a refreshing oasis in the desert of wild ec- 
centricity." The chief merit in an old-style plate, 
it seems to us, is found when the engraver has hap- 
pened to be a Dttrer, a Hogarth, a Vertue, or a 
Morghen ; but detached examples of the more am- 
bitious work of these artists are still obtainable, so 
in place of the English and Continental armorial 
book-plates let us have the "wild eccentricities." 
Examples of these, we believe, are promised in the 
forthcoming books of Messrs. Castle and Allen. 

" Travels in America 100 Years Ago" 

American life . p 

and character (Harper s " Black and White series) 
is the record of the American impres- 
sions of one Thomas Twining, an intelligent Anglo- 
Indian who visited the United States almost at the 
beginning of our national existence. As Mr. Twin- 
ing was, the time and his nationality considered, a 
singularly liberal and unbiassed observer, his jot- 
tings are of value. Sailing from Calcutta Dec. 9, 
1795, in the American ship "India," of three hun- 
dred tons burthen, he reached Philadelphia April 7, 
where, he records, " I stepped ashore without even 
the aid of a plank," and was at once greeted with. 
" How dost thou do, friend ? I am glad to see thee." 
Mr. Twining visited the chief cities during his stay, 
and met many people of note. Especially interest- 
ing is his account of a visit to General Washington, 
who was then living at Philadelphia " in a small red 
brick house on the left side of High Street, not much 
higher up than Fourth Street," and next door to a 
hair-dresser's. Mr. Twining was received by Mrs. 
Washington, " a middle-sized lady, rather stout ; her 
manner extremely kind and unaffected." Presently 
" the door opened, and Mrs. Washington and myself 
rising, she said, ' The President,' and introduced 
me to him. Never did I feel more interest than at 
this moment, when I saw the tall, upright, venerable 
figure of this great man advancing to me to take me 
by the hand. There was a seriousness in his man- 
ner which seemed to contribute to the impressive 
dignity of his person, without diminishing the con- 
fidence and ease which the benevolence of his coun- 



1894.]

tenance and the kindness of his address inspired. 
There are persons in whose appearance one looks in 
vain for the qualities they are known to possess, but 
the appearance of General Washington harmonized 
in a singular manner with the dignity and modesty 
of his public life. So completely did he look the 
great man he really was, that I felt rather respect 
than awe in his presence, and experienced neither the 
surprise nor disappointment with which a personal 
introduction to distinguished individuals is often ac- 
companied. ... In person he was tall, well-propor- 
tioned, and upright. His hair was powdered, and 
tied behind. Although his deportment was that of 
a general, the expression of his features had rather 
the calm dignity of a legislator than the severity of 
a soldier." There is a portrait of the author. 



Shakespeare 
portrayed in 
modern comedy. 



The writing of a play with the great- 
est of all play-writers as its central 
figure and controlling spirit is cer- 
tainly a novel and adventurous task. This is what 
has been attempted by Mr. Harry B. Smith in " Will 
Shakspeare, a Comedy," published in an elegant 
private edition in Chicago. Writers of historical 
dramas have usually chosen subjects that afforded 
them a foundation of attested fact to build upon ; but 
this advantage has not been enjoyed by the writer 
of this little play, who has had to pick his material 
bit by bit from the mass of scraps and fragments, 
partly biography but more largely tradition and 
conjecture, that constitute about all we know of 
Shakespeare outside of his own works. Perhaps 
the meagreness of exact information has in one way 
been an advantage in this case, as it has left the au- 
thor greater freedom and independence in following 
his own insight and working out his own conception 
of his hero's character. It is to be noted, as a prime 
merit of this ingenious production, that the author 
has really succeeded in making Shakespeare real to 
us as a man and in giving to his character a genu- 
ine human interest. We see him as the roystering 
young fellow about Stratford, joining a party of 
strolling players and going off with them to Lon- 
don ; as a boon companion and reveller among the 
wits of the Mermaid Tavern, with Ben Jonson, 
Fletcher, Burbage, and other choice spirits of that 
time and place ; and, lastly, as a player at the Globe 
Theatre on the Bankside, beginning to concern him- 
self with matters of stage management, and taking 
the character of Hamlet in the ancient play which 
he had just re-written for the stage. These scenes 
and episodes are set forth with sympathy and pen- 
etration, and enlivened with much genuine humor. 
So admirably is the little three-act comedy con- 
structed, with such dramatic skill and so fine and 
sure a literary touch that it brings the character and 
environment of Shakespeare more vividly before 
us than volumes of mere biography or commentary 
could do. The play has, withal, much vivacity and 
spirit, with a number of capital situations which can 
of course be properly estimated only on the stage, 
to which it manifestly will find its way. 



Within College Walls " (The Baker 
& Ta y lor Co.) is a collection of ten 
short papers on matters pertaining 
to the college. The author is President Charles 
Franklin Thwing, of Adelbert. The tone of the 
book is religious and ethical; its real subject, the 
college as a Christianizing agency. The author is 
of course right when he dwells on the importance 
of the college in developing character, on its possi- 
ble influence in leading to faith and to a sustaining 
trust in things divine. But just as distinctly he 
seems wrong when he insists that all this is the un- 
derlying principle and definite purpose of the col- 
lege's existence. Every college, indeed, stands or 
should stand for the right; but its real aim is to 
assist in the search for truth. Its religious and 
moral influence is a means, not an end. This dis- 
tinction between truth and right as the first aim of 
an institution of learning is not a verbal quibble. 
Its practical test lies here : build up your college as 
President Thwing would have it, and you run no 
end of risks. For instance, in engaging a professor, 
choose a good religious man who doesn't know his 
subject, in preference to a scholar who is less holy 
but more erudite ; ask this new professor to make 
character - building his main work in the class- 
room: will this, or will it not, approximate toward 
the ideal college? The author thinks it will. But 
the fact is that this plan has been tried disastrously 
over and over again. The scores of small and strug- 
gling denominational colleges that have followed 
the scheme contrast pitifully with the no less strug- 
gling state universities to which the plan was im- 
possible. Could the plan be fairly tried, the relig- 
ious would at once crowd out the scholarly ; and in 
the present system of our great universities the 
scholarly has never once crowded out the ethical. 
Lofty, then, as is the author's aim, it is the aim of 
the man who sees but one side of the question, and 
that, tested by theory and experience, the unsafe side.

e " The English Religious Drama 

Religion* Drama. ( Macm iu a n & Co.) is one to be com- 
mended. Few besides special students know much 
about this subject, the manuals of English Litera- 
ture commonly dismissing it with brief mention, as 
having but little relation to the more important sec- 
ular drama by which it was followed. Miss Bates 
does not so regard it, but considers the Miracle 
Plays to have been the training school of the ro- 
mantic drama. She finds them, despite crudities, 
prolixities, and absurdities of detail, to have ren- 
dered very important service to the Elizabethan 
drama. They not only bequeathed to it scope and 
freedom, large constructive principles, reality of 
characterization, and intensity of passion, but they 
paved the way for its reception and recognition. 
They made England a nation of actors and theatre- 
lovers, who would be content with no such learned 
and elegant trifling as amused the court and uni- 
versity, but demanded range, earnestness, life.

Many of these Mystery cycles were probably lost ; 
but four important groups York, Towneley, Ches- 
ter, and Coventry remain in completeness, and to 
the description of these, with some citations and a 
critical chapter on their dramatic values, the larger 
portion of Miss Bates's book is devoted. A con- 
cluding chapter on the Moralities is only less inter- 
esting because the subject is in itself a dull one. 
Taken as a whole, the subject is treated with fulness 
and accuracy, and in a style so pleasing and pictur- 
esque that the volume will find many appreciative 
readers. 

Professor Clinton Scollard's " On 
An American poet gunny Shores" (Webster), a series 

motherlands. J . \ '' 

of sketchy Meiseoitaer, forms a fit- 
ting complement to his previously-published " Under 
Summer Skies." Starting at the banks of the Wye, 
the author touches at Ambleside and the Isle of 
Wight, tramps down the Neckar, tarries a space in 
the Tyrol, crosses the Splilgen, idles a day or so at 
Bellaggio, Milan, and Verona, thence, touching en 
route at Greece, fares to Syria, and after "doing" 
the Cave of Adullam, Mar-Saba, and Mt. Hennon, 
pulls up rather fagged, one fancies in "A Da- 
mascus Garden." Professor Scollard conveys his 
impressions of each halting-place with a few rapid 
touches, and, when the muse proves propitious, 
drops into poetry, with pleasing results. There are 
many pen-sketches by Margaret Landers Randolph, 
and the book is prettily bound in violet cloth, with 
side-stamp of white and gold. 

The "Mermaid Series" of Eliza- 
The plays of bethan plays, of which the publica- 

JSen Jonson. , i 4 i IP 

tion had been discontinued for two 
or three years, is now resumed with the plays of Ben 
Jonson (Scribner). Three volumes, edited by Dr. 
Brinley Nicholson, are to be given to this dramatist ; 
and the first of the three, with an admirable critical 
essay by Professor C. H. Herford, has just appeared. 
" Every Man in His Humor," " Every Man out of 
His Humor," and " The Poetaster " are the plays 
included. The mechanical execution of this volume 
is inferior to that of the sixteen volumes previously 
issued. But we are glad to have the series contin- 
ued in any form, as it provides a working selection 
from the Elizabethan drama, at slight cost to the 
student, and with a full and carefully-edited text. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" The Jews of Angevin England " is published in the 
very useful series entitled " English History by Contem- 
porary Writers " (Putnam). The contents of these vol- 
umes consist of strictly original materials, extracted from 
the chronicles, state-papers, and other documents of the 
time, and translated into English. Mr. Joseph Jacobs 
is the industrious compiler of the present volume, which 
includes " every scrap of evidence I could find in the 
English records, whether printed or unedited, that re- 
lates to the Jews of England up to the year 1206." 
Many of the passages are translations from the Hebrew. 



In his "Saskia, the Wife of Rembrandt" (Crowell), 
Mr. C. K. Bolton essays the rather hopeless task of 
writing a Life in the face of an almost entire lack of 
data; evolving his heroine, as it were, largely from the 
" vasty deep " of his own inner consciousness. Next to 
nothing is absolutely known of Saskia, and Mr. Boltou 
seems to have unearthed no fresh facts concerning her. 
His little book is, however, readable enough in its mod- 
est way, and the copious plates (mostly portraits and 
studies, more or less plausibly presumed to be Saskia), 
after Rembrandt, lend it an element of positive interest. 

Louise Creighton's " A First History of France " 
(Longmans), from Caesar's conquest down to the fall 
of the Second Empire, is a satisfactory outline sketch 
for the use of young readers. The little book may be 
used to advantage as a brief preparatory study to Mrs. 
Gardiner's capital text -book on the French Revolu- 
tion, issued by the same house. The work is well printed 
and judiciously illustrated, and it contains the needful 
maps. 

" The Court of Louis XV." and " The Last Years of 
Louis XV.," the eighteenth and nineteenth volumes of 
M. de Saint- Amand's "Famous Women of the French 
Court " (Scribner), will be welcomed by readers of this 
extremely readable series. The books are quite unique 
in their way; and literary workers will find in them a 
useful storehouse of literally-quoted extracts from mem- 
oirs, letters, diaries, etc., of the period covered. The 
present volumes, embracing the fortunes of those lights 
of the royal seraglio, Mmes. de Pompadour and Du 
Barry, should prove popular. 

We are glad to note the appearance, in a single vol- 
ume (Burt), of the selections from Schopenhauer's 
" Parerga and Paralipomena " which Mr. T. Bailey 
Saunders made and translated into English about two 
years ago. The present publication appears in a " Li- 
brary of the World's Best Books," and, for a wonder, 
it distinctly belongs in a collection thus named. Mr. 
Saunders's introduction is readable, but imperfectly sym- 
pathetic, and his translation is admirable. The book is 
full of meat, and one needs no fondness for metaphys- 
ics to extract from it both enjoyment and profit. For 
lack of proper presentation to the English-reading pub- 
lic, Schopenhauer has come to occupy .the position of 
being more talked about and less read than any other 
modern Continental philosopher of "importance. We 
hope the present volume will cause him to be more read 
and less talked about. 



NEW YORK TOPICS. 



New York, January 24, 1894. 

Anyone who observes the work done by illustrators, 
American and foreign, in the periodicals of the time, 
cannot fail to be impressed with the amount of genius 
and technical ability which they bring to their task. The 
immense advance in the art of illustrating which has 
taken place within the past few years has lately been 
emphasized by the publication of numerous books treat- 
ing of illustrators and their designs. But to me the most 
significant piece of illustration observed in last year's 
periodicals was an instantaneous photographic view of 
the sinking of H. M. S. Victoria, reproduced by process 
in one of the London illustrated weeklies. This photo- 
graph was taken by a British officer on board one of the 
accompanying vessels, and, while small in size and not

very distinct, conveys a striking impression of the event. 
There can be no question that it was the great and in- 
creasing interest in amateur photography which made it 
possible for this officer to have his camera at hand, to 
understand its use, and to grasp the occasion on the mo- 
ment. Possibly fifty imaginative pictures of this disaster 
have been drawn for the periodical press, but none of 
them has appealed so strongly to the imagination as this 
actual view of the event itself. 

These suggestions came to mind in looking over a 
copy of Mr. Alexander Black's " Photography Indoors 
and Out," just published by Messrs. Houghton, and bear- 
ing for its sub-title "A Book for Amateurs." The little 
volume has met with exceeding favor in the press, and 
is likely to prove a valuable manual for all beginners in 
photography. Mr. Black has been for some years the 
literary editor of the Brooklyn (N. Y.) " Times." He 
devotes a great part of his spare time to the study and 
practice of photography as a fine art, and frequently lec- 
tures on the relations of photography to its sister arts. 

The announcement of an article on Nikola Tesla, by 
T. C. Martin, in the February number of "The Century 
Magazine," calls attention to the fact that Tesla is already 
acknowledged in the electrical world as a sort of junior 
Edison. Mr. Martin recently issued a volume entitled 
" The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola 
Tesla," which contains a description of the inventor's 
discoveries and his principal lectures delivered before 
electrical societies. Mr. Tesla is a native of Servia, and 
has, I believe, received from that country a decoration 
in recognition of his achievements. 

The article in the last number of THE DIAL entitled 
" The Star' System in Periodicals" comes very appropri- 
ately at a time when this system, having been " worked " 
to the furthest possible point, seems to show signs of an 
early death. One amusing phase of the system is its 
adoption by the advertising fraternity. So it caused no 
great surprise to pick up in some little shop a pamphlet 
entitled " The Story of My First Watch: Told by Emi- 
nent Americans." Surely, thought I, this is the latest 
venture in the composite-article field; but on turning 
over the leaves I found that it was nothing more or less 
than the advertising device of a shrewd manufacturer of 
watches, who had induced fifteen or twenty of the public 
men and women whose names appear most prominently 
in " The ' Star ' System in Periodicals " to write from a 
quarter to half a page descriptive of how they came in 
possession of their first watches, the whole made up into 
a pamphlet, with portraits of the writers, some of whose 
stories were extremely interesting. The advertisers of 
the day are indeed quick to seize upon new ideas, but it 
appears to me that their adoption of the " star system " in 
vogue among various periodicals will compel the latter, 
in turn, to seek for some other novelty. Nevertheless, 
for a while it has seemed as if the great American public 
was more deeply interested in how our leading authors 
wrote their first books than in the books themselves an 
injustice to the books in a majority of cases. 

Mr. William Young, the poet and dramatist, whose 
comedy, " The Rajah," made such a successful run at the 
Old Madison Square Theatre, and whose blank verse 
tragedies, " Pendragon " and " Ganelon," were so artist- 
ically produced by the late Lawrence Barrett, is spend- 
ing the winter in Washington, engaged in perfecting 
arrangements for the production of his new comedy 
dealing with Revolutionary times. He has written for 
the forthcoming number of " The Cosmopolitan " a little 
poem entitled " The Beggars," which deals with the 



quarrel between the rich man and the poor man from a 
socialistic point of view. 

Talking with Dr. Edward Eggleston the other day, I 
was interested to learn that the old straw chair in his 
library at "Joshua's Rock," Lake George, was woven 
by an ex-slave of John Randolph, when about ninety 
years of age. .The chair has been in use for more than 
twenty years, and in it the Doctor has written all his 
novels, from " The Hoosier Schoolmaster " to " The 
Faith Doctor." The desk in the same room is one that 
belonged to Dr. Eggleston's great-grandfather in Co- 
lonial times. 

Much interest is taken in the authors' reading, or ma- 
tine"e, soon to be given in Boston. The proceeds will 
be devoted to the relief of the suffering poor. The 
list of patronesses includes both prominent society ladies 
and ladies prominent in the literary world a combina- 
tion, perhaps, devoutly to be desired, but not yet con- 
summated, in New York. Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, Col. 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Mrs. Louise Chandler 
Moulton, Mrs. Julia C. R. Dorr, and others have prom- 
ised to read, and a large sum of money will be obtained 
for the charitable purposes of those concerned in man- 
aging the affair. From Boston also comes news of the 
death in Rome of Mrs. William Wetmore Story, the wife 
of the sculptor-poet. She was a Miss Eldredge, of Bos- 
ton, and her son, who married Emma Eames, is Julian 
Story. Mrs. Story, it is said, was a woman of uncom- 
mon intellectual attainments, of lovely character, of high 
social distinction, and in her early years was considered 
a great beauty. 

By the death of Prof. Edward T. McLaughlin, Yale 
University suffered as great a loss in her professorial 
staff as she has met with in recent years. The univer- 
sity has always been greatly hampered in its literary 
department by financial inability to provide a sufficient 
number of instructors. The incumbent professors, with 
Mr. McLaughlin, have accomplished what they could, 
but the latter's youthful enthusiasm will be greatly 
missed by them. One of his specialties was the study 
of mediaeval life and literature, and a volume on these 
subjects, the manuscript of which he had completed, will 
shortly be published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons.

JjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

On February 6, Professor Haeckel will reach his six- 
tieth birthday, and it is proposed to celebrate the occa- 
sion by placing a marble bust of him in the Zoological 
Institute at Jena. 

Mr. Frederick Douglass has written an introduction 
for a translation of the life of Toussaint L'Ouverture 
by the late M. Victor Sehffilcher. The translation will 
be by Mr. Theodore Stanton. 

Renan's library, we are told, will be sold in a few 
weeks. The catalogue, now in preparation, will contain 
about 7,000 titles, being the pick of the collection. The 
unimportant books have already been weeded out and 
disposed of. 

M. Emile Terquem, who represented the French pub- 
lishers at the Columbian Exposition, sends us a copy of 
the report made by him to the Paris Cercle de la Librai- 
rie. He expresses great satisfaction with the success of 
the exhibit, even from the point of view of sales actually 
made, since he found it necessary to take back only

exhibition. Of the very attractive catalogue issued by 
him 1500 copies were distributed. 

The following words have a melancholy interest as 
being the last written for publication by Professor Tyn- 
dall, and the fact that they were written as a Christ- 
mas message to his friends in America doubles their 
interest for us on this side of the Atlantic : " I choose 
the nobler part of Emerson, when, after various disen- 
chantments, he exclaims, ' I covet truth ! ' The gladness 
of true heroism visits the heart of him who is really com- 
petent to say this." One cannot help thinking of the 
motto veritatem dilexi that Renan desired should be 
engraved upon his tombstone. 

The report of Commissioner Harris on the Common 
Schools of the United States shows an enrollment for 
1891-92 of over thirteen millions of pupils, the average 
daily attendance being about eight and a half millions. 
A quarter of a million women and half that number of 
men were engaged in teaching these children for an av- 
erage of 137 days in the year. The total expenditure 
was in excess of one hundred and fifty millions. The 
school term is slowly lengthening and the annual expend- 
iture is increasing. The noticeable replacement of men 
by women as teachers is an unfortunate symptom in view 
of the great disproportion already existing. 

The University of Chicago has recently purchased 
what is claimed to be the most complete collection in 
existence of the public documents of the United States. 
There are from four to five thousand volumes. The pur- 
chase includes, besides nearly three thousand volumes of 
Senate and House executive documents, complete sets of 
the American Archives from 1774 to 1776, American 
State Papers from 1789 to 1828, Journals of Congress 
from the first in 1789 to 1891, Executive Journals from 
1789 to 1869, the Annals of Congress from 1789 to 1822, 
the Congressional Debates from 1822 to 1837, the Con- 
gressional Globe from 1833 to 1873, and the Congres- 
sional Record from 1873 to 1892. 

The following particulars concerning the new French 
review are taken from the "Athenaeum": "Although 
a fortnightly review, of the external type of the ' Revue 
des deux Mondes,' in some respects the 'Revue de 
Paris ' will be more akin to our great English month- 
lies. There will be no chronicle of art, literature, 
music, the drama, contributed by an established staff; 
but on all questions of the hour the ' Revue de Paris ' 
will address itself directly to the writers, French or for- 
eign, most capable of treating them. It will have no 
definite bias, religious or political ; the names of Prince 
Henri d'Orle*ans, Prince Roland Bonaparte, and M. Gode- 
froy Cavaignac are a guarantee of its political inde- 
pendence. Historical articles are promised for the forth- 
coming numbers, from the pens of MM. Sorel, Gaston 
Paris, Jusserand, A. Vandal, and others. M. Sully Prud- 
homme will write on Pascal's method, M. Pierre Loti 
on Loyola, Arvede Barine will discuss the ethics of 
Ibsen, M. Emile Faguet the talent of M. Brunetiere, M. 
Jules Lemaitre 'La Chanson au XIX. Siecle.' M. 
Jules Simon will contribue his souvenirs of M. Ernest 
Renan, while the review has secured an unpublished 
chapter of M. Ernest Renan's on Philo of Alexandria. 
It is not less fortunate in fiction. It will open with a 
novel by M. Anatole France (' Scruples de Femmes') 
to be followed by ' Deux Jeunes Filles ' by M. Ludovic 
Hale*vy, and ' Idylle Tragique ' by M. Paul Bourget. 
Gyp will contribute ' Le Mariage de Chiffon,' Alphonse 
Daudet ' Quinze Ans de Manage.' The younger nov- 



elists, MM. Paul Margueritte, Paul Hervieu, Marcel 
PreVost, Maurice Barres, and J. Ricard will also be 
represented. We believe it is an open secret that the 
editorship will be shared by MM. Louis Gauderax and 
James Darmesteter, and that the well-known publisher 
M. Paul Calmann LeVy is the principal shareholder." 
The initial number is promised for the first of February. 



CONSTANCE FENIMORE WOOLSON. 

By the death of Miss Constance Fenimore Woolson, 
which occurred at Venice, Italy, January 24, America 
lost one of the best of its fiction writers. She wrote 
a great many short stories and sketches, besides a half 
dozen or so extended novels ; the last of these, " Horace 
Chase," was lately published as a serial in " Harper's 
Monthly," and will soon appear in book form. Miss 
Woolson was born at Claremont, N. H., in 1845, her 
mother being a niece of Fenimore Cooper. From an 
authentic sketch of her life, written by Mr. Arthur 
Stedman, and published in " The Book Buyer " for Oc- 
tober, 1889, we make the following extracts: 

" While yet a child, Miss Woolson was taken by her 
parents to Cleveland, Ohio, her father's business interests 
having become centred there. She was educated at a 
Cleveland young ladies' seminary and at the famous 
French school of Madame Chegaray in New York. Her 
summers were chiefly spent, while a girl, on the island 
of Mackinac, in the straits connecting Lakes Huron and 
Michigan. She often, however, accompanied her father 
on his business trips to the shores of Lake Superior, 
through the farming districts of the Western Reserve, 
and up and down the Ohio Valley, until she became 
familiar with a great part of the country that includes 
the great lakes and the Central States. 

" Her father's death, in 1869, and the consequent 
breaking up of the family, cast a shadow on her life, 
and urged her to serious pursuits. She had been brought 
up strictly in the Episcopal faith, and at this time had 
published a number of articles in periodicals of that de- 
nomination. . . . Her literary field soon extended, and 
stories, sketches, and poems appeared in profusion in 
'Harper's' and other leading magazines. Selected 
stories relating to the region of the great lakes were 
published as Miss Woolson's first book, in 1875, with 
the title, 'Castle Nowhere: Lake-Country Sketches.' 

" In the fall of 1873, her mother's failing health ne- 
cessitated a trip to Florida. There, at St. Augustine 
and on an island in the St. John's River, Mrs. and Miss 
Woolson remained for five winters, the summers being 
spent in the mountains of North Carolina and Virginia, 
in South Carolina and Georgia, and later with their rel- 
atives at Cooperstown. The literary results of this long 
stay in the South are readily to be discerned. 

" The death of her mother in February, 1879, caused 
a complete change in Miss Woolson's plans, and the 
same year she sailed for England. Since then she has 
been in America but once, and for a very short time. 
Her winters have been passed chiefly at Florence, though 
she has resided for long periods at Rome and Sorrento. 
In summer she has lived at Venice, and at various re- 
sorts in Switzerland and Germany. . . . Since the be- 
ginning of 1887 Miss Woolson has lived at the Villa 
Bricchieri, just outside the Roman gate of Florence, the 
same locality that is mentioned in Mrs. Browning's 
' Aurora Leigh,' 
" ' I found a house at Florence on the hill of Bellosguardo.' 

" Miss Woolson is not a rapid composer. Her novel,

' Anne,' was nearly three years in the writing, a worthy 
example to novelists of the day. Her first book, and 
the second collection of stories, 'Rodman the Keeper: 
Southern Sketches,' published in 1880, had attracted 
attention to the new author, but the appearance of 
' Anne ' in book form, in 1882, placed her at once 
in the front rank of American prose writers. This 
volume has been followed by 'For the Major, 1883; 
'East Angels,' 1886; and 'Jupiter Lights,' 1889, the 
last of which, the ' London Spectator ' thinks, bids fair 
to rival ' Anne,' which it calls ' one of the best novels 
America has produced for the last quarter of a century.' 
Our novelist is intensely American. All of these books 
deal with the life and adventures of Americans in their 
own country, though of widely differing types, and in 
Avidely separated districts."

THE DIAL-ITS FIELD AND WORK. 



THE DIAL was established in 1880 as a monthly 
journal of Literary Criticism only, remaining such 
until September, 1892, when, by its change to semi- 
monthly publication, and by enlargement of its scope 
so as to include the broader interests of Literature, 
of Education, and of Higher Culture generally, it 

entered upon a new career of 

THE DIAL is the best . a . T, 

publication of its kind influence and prosperity. Its 
in this country .JOHN chief features are : Carefully 
written Editorial Articles up- 
on prominent literary, educational, and allied sub- 
jects ; Contributed Articles by well-known writers, 
upon timely and important topics ; occasional short 
Poems upon literary themes; the discussion of spe- 
cial subjects in Communications ; extended Reviews 
of the important books of the day, more exhaustive 
and elaborate than appear in any other American 
critical journal, and signed by the writers, usually 
well-known specialists and recognized authorities on 
the subjects discussed ; briefer but carefully written 
Criticisms of a great variety of New Books ; a full 
department of Literary Notes, News, and Miscel- 
lany ; an Index to Topics in 
current 



THE DIAL, in my opin- 
ion, is the best critical 
journal in this country, and a complete List of the 
-HJALMAR H. BOYE- New Books o f the f ortn ight, 

carefully classified in depart- 
ments, with full details of size, price, etc., by which 
the reader is kept fully informed as to the import- 
ant new books in all departments of literature. A 
trained and efficient editorial staff, and a list of 
contributors representing the faculties of over thirty 



universities and colleges, including many of the fore- 
most American scholars and specialists, guarantee 
the high quality of THE DIAL'S contents, and justify 
its claim to its distinctive position as the foremost 
"Journal of Literary Criticism, Discussion, and In- 
formation" in America. Its elegant typography and 
paper especially commend it, 
and combine, with carefully 
can literary periodicals, prepared contents, to make it 
Francisco* 00 " AUT> ^ an agreeable literary compan- 
ion and an invaluable aid to 

all who would keep abreast of the rapidly moving 
literary current. THE DIAL is not local or sectional 
its field and work are constantly broadening. 
During 1893 the first complete year since it be- 
came a semi-monthly its progress was such as to 
mark a distinct epoch in its history. The circula- 
tion has rapidly increased, and its geographical dis- 
tribution shows the national character and influence 
attained by the journal. While the great West and 
Northwest are most prominently represented, its 
constituency embraces many names in every State 
and Territory of the Union.

indispensable." Boston Journal.

THE PASQUIER MEMOIRS. 

Edited by Due D'AUDIFFKET-PASQUIER. With Portraits. In 3 vols., 8vo. Vol. I. now ready. $2.50. 

"Memoirs which promise to be among the most valuable ever published concerning the Napoleonic period. Pasquier's account of the 
Empire is surely one of the best that any contemporary has left us. It will be found rich in material concerning the imperial regime, and in 
portraits of Napoleon's family and associates." Atlantic Monthly. 

"Pasquier lived through the Revolution, the Consulate, the Empire ; he held office under every regime ; he became the Chancellor of 
France ; he was intimate with Napoleon and Talleyrand in short, of all Frenchmen save Talleyrand himself, he was the best equipped to write 
the history of his time. How well he has done this it is as yet too early to say ; but he has done it admirably should the remaining two vol- 
umes of the work equal in interest the first, now before us." Philadelphia Press. 

PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY FRANCE. 

By ROBERT FLINT, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the University of Edinburgh, author of " Theism," " Anti-Theistic 

Theories," etc. 8vo, $4.00. 

" The volume makes up a large octavo of 705 pages, and is replete in interest to the philosophical student of history. It is both historical 
and critical, and it aims to show the rise and progress of reflection and speculation in human developments. It is a valuable and entertaining 
book. The thoughtful scholar will find the volume a rich mine of thought." Chicago Inter Ocean. 

CIVILIZATION DURING THE MIDDLE AGES. 

Especially in Relation to Modern Civilization. By GEORGE B. ADAMS, Professor of History in Yale University. 8vo, $2.50. 

"Professor Adams's work is lucid in plan and style, comprehensive in its survey of the field, and has the additional merit of being highly 
interesting. " Prof . GEORGE P. FISHER. 

" This volume, we are confident, will be found one of the notable books of the year just begun. Professor Adams proceeds on the assump- 
tion that the facts of history are known. It is with the sequence and philosophy of these facts he deals, and it is here that his work has its 
great value." Boston Daily Advertiser. 

REMBRANDT: HIS LIFE, HIS WORK, AND HIS TIME. 

By EMILE MICHEL. Edited by FREDERIC WEDMORE. With more than 320 Photogravures, colored Plates, and text 

Illustrations. 2 vols., royal 8vo, $15.00. 

" Let us say at once that the book is admirable, and, considering what it contains, astonishingly cheap. M. Michel is one of the leading 
authorities on Rembrandt and his works, and hag written a monumental, and, we should think, nearly definitive life. Hardly too much can b< 
said in praise of the illustrations." The Nation.

THE USES OF BOOKS. 

Those who have written in the praise of 
books, from Richard de Bury and Petrarch to 
Emerson and Carlyle, have mostly been con- 
tent with the assumption that books are meant 
to be read. The other use of books, that made 
by the student, who considers them as the im- 
plements or apparatus of his work, has been 
largely ignored by such eloquent panegyrists of 
literature as those above named. In spite of 
an occasional suggestion, such as that made by 
Bacon when he tells us that " some books are 
to be read only in parts," the second function 
of literature has been left for the modern bib- 
liographer fully to recognize, and even he has 
by no means reached as yet the general con- 
sciousness of the intelligent public. Dr. Will- 
iam Frederick Poole, the veteran librarian, 
whose faith and works have gone hand in hand 
for nearly half a century, has done as much as 
anyone among modern bibliographers to call 
attention to the uses of books for reference 
rather than for reading, to their employment 
as intellectual tools rather than as means of 
mere gratification. The subject has been re- 
called to us by a little book just published by 
Dr. Poole, and a few remarks upon so inter- 
esting a theme may not be inappropriate. 

Dr. Poole's book is a university address, and 
has to do with the relations of the library to 
educational work. Its essential plea is thus 
stated : " I wished to show that the study of 
bibliography and of the scientific methods of 
using books should have an assured place in 
the university curriculum ; that a wise and pro- 
fessional bibliographer should be a member of 
the faculty and have a part in training all the 
students ; that the library should be his class- 
room, and that all who go forth into the world 
as graduates should have such an intelligent and 
practical knowledge of books as will aid them in 
their studies through life, and the use of books 
be to them a perpetual delight and refresh- 
ment." All this is admirably put, and we give 
it the most cordial assent. But possibly the au- 
thor does not quite realize the extent to which 
the aims which he thus outlines have already 
reached fulfilment. Although he gives due 
credit to the bibliographical work done in some 
half a dozen of our leading universities, he is 



100 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



evidently still haunted by recollections of his 
own student years, when " Yale College Li- 
brary might as well have been in Weathers- 
field or Bridgeport as in New Haven, as far as 
the students in those days were concerned." 
Certainly the state of things in which " books, 
outside of the text-books used, had no part in 
our education " no longer exists in any Amer- 
ican college having any standing at all. At 
that time, we read, books " were never quoted, 
recommended, nor mentioned by the instruct- 
ors in the class-room." To-day, it is safe 
enough to say that in our higher institutions of 
a progressive sort, books of reference are men- 
tioned, quoted, and recommended to an extent 
that must help compliant students to enter 
into the feelings of a Strasburg goose. And in 
the Seminar, rapidly becoming naturalized in 
our better universities, the work done is almost 
wholly of the sort that Dr. Poole pleads for. 

Yet it would be possible to progress one step 
further in this direction, and the gist of Dr. 
Poole's address may be found in what he says 
upon this point. The class-room lecture, with 
its frequent references to the literature of the 
subject dealt with, and the graduate Seminar, 
which brings the student into actual contact 
with that literature, and sets him to delving 
in it, are praiseworthy as far as they go, but 
their effect (from the bibliographical stand- 
point) remains special, and therefore incom- 
plete. Dr. Poole dreams of a time when the 
student may be given the keys, not only of his 
own subjects, but of all others that he may pos- 
sibly at some time in the future wish to make 
his own. Not, we are told, " that he should 
learn the contents of the most useful books," 
but " that he should know of their existence, 
what they treat of, and what they will do for 
him." And the author goes on to say : " He 
should know what are the most important gen- 
eral reference books which will answer not 
only his own questions, but the multitude of 
inquiries put to him by less-favored associates 
who regard him as an educated man. If a 
question arises as to the existence, authorship, 
or subject of a book, an educated man should 
know the catalogues or bibliographies by which 
he can readily clear up the doubt. The words 
Watt, Larousse, Graesse, Querard, Hoefer, 
Kayser, Hinrichs, Meyer, Ham, and Vapereau 
should not be unmeaning sounds to him. He 
should know the standard writers on a large 
variety of subjects." 

There is no doubt that a certain amount of 
this sort of knowledge would prove a useful 



equipment to the educated man, whatever his 
specialty ; and there is likewise no doubt that 
the process of getting it for one's self unaided 
is a laborious task. We believe, with Dr. 
Poole, that every university having a library 
should also have a librarian, and that cata- 
loguing and custodianship should be but a part 
of his duties. His rank as a member of the 
faculty of instruction should be undisputed, 
and he should act not only as a general ad- 
viser to students, but also as the teacher of his 
specific subject. He should be both a compe- 
tent professional bibliographer and a man of 
the broadest general culture, familiar with the 
outlines of many subjects, and conversant with 
the literature of the languages of culture. From 
such an instructor the student might get a 
knowledge of the resources of the general li- 
brary sure to stand him in good stead upon 
many occasions, and by such a colleague even 
the department professor might often be di- 
rected to sources of information that would 
have escaped his own search. The true func- 
tion of the university librarian has already been 
apprehended in some of our higher institutions 
of learning, but he claims a far more general 
recognition than has yet been accorded him, 
and we are glad that Dr. Poole has given us 
this opportunity to supplement his own vigor- 
ous and convincing appeal made in behalf of 
the bibliographical educator. 



MAXIME DUCAMP, member of the French Acad- 
emy, died in Paris on the ninth of this month. He 
was born in Paris February 8, 1822. When a young 
man, he made a journey in the East, which he de- 
scribed in his " Souvenirs et Paysage d'Orient " 
(1848). In the insurrection of 1848 he fought in 
the ranks of the National Guard and was decorated. 
Sent by the government upon a second Eastern 
journey, which occupied the period 1849-51, he re- 
turned to write of his experiences in " Egypte, Nu- 
bie, Palestine, et Syrie" (1852), and Le Nil, 
Egypte, et Nubie " (1854). He devoted the fol- 
lowing years to the composition of poems and novels. 
In 1860, the conservative of 1848 had become 
radical enough to take part in the Sicilian expe- 
dition of Garibaldi and the Thousand. This was 
written up in his " Expedition des Deux-Siciles." 
Another volume of travel, " Orient et Italie," ap- 
peared in 1868. His greatest work, "Paris, Ses 
Organes, Ses Functions, et Sa Vie " (1869-75) fills 
six volumes. Next in importance is "Les Convul- 
sions de Paris," a history of the Commune, in which 
he again figured as a conservative, and earned the 
hatred of the radicals. He was a realist in art, and as 
a student of history and society had pronounced affi- 
liations with Taine, who held him in high regard.

ENGLISH AT COLUMBIA COLLEGE* 

In a small college a professor of English is called 
upon to give instruction in three or four distinct 
subjects, in the use of the English language, ordi- 
narily termed rhetoric, in the history of the English 
language, in the history of English literature, and 
often also (if he should happen to be ambitious) 
in the history of the development of the more im- 
portant literary forms (the drama, for example, and 
the novel) in other literatures as well as in English. 
In a large college, and in a university where much 
graduate work is carried on, these four subjects are 
divided among different professors, each of whom, 
whatever the title of his chair, in reality gives in- 
struction in those divisions of the subject in which 
he takes most interest. At Columbia College we 
have a Professor of Rhetoric and English Com- 
position, Mr. George R. Carpenter, with several as- 
sistants. We have a Professor of English Language 
and Literature, Mr. Thomas R. Price, and an Ad- 
junct Professor of English, Mr. A. V. Williams 
Jackson. We have also two Professors of Litera- 
ature, Mr. George E. Woodberry and myself. 

In the department of rhetoric, Prof. G. R. Car- 
penter and his chief assistant, Mr. Baldwin, lecture 
to the lower classes on the principles of English 
composition. As the best way to teach students to 
write is to have them write freely and frequently, 
they are called upon to express themselves on topics 
in which they are interested and often of their own 
choice. Their written work for other professors is 
often submitted also to the instructors in rhetoric. 
These essays are criticised by the instructors in pri- 
vate talks with every individual student. The gen- 
eral tendency of the instruction is affirmative rather 
than negative. In other words, instead of telling 
the student what he must not do and of dwelling 
on the faults he should avoid, the aim of the in- 
structors is to show him how to express himself 
easily and vigorously. As this is Professor Car- 
penter's first year at Columbia, the courses in rhet- 
oric are not yet fully developed ; next year they 
will be enlarged and increased. Certain courses 
given by other professors really belong in the de- 
partment of rhetoric. One of these is Professor 
Price's course (two hours a week throughout the 
year) on the " Laws of Prose Composition in En- 
glish." Another is my own (one hour a week through- 
out the year) on " The Art of English Versification," 
an attempt to give practical instruction in metrical 
composition. 

The instruction in the history of the English lan- 
guage is as distinct as may be from the instruction 
in the history of English literature. In the depart-

ment of the Germanic languages, of which Prof. H. 
H. Boyesen is the head, he and Prof. W. H. Car- 
penter offer courses in Icelandic, in Gothic, in Mid- 
dle High German and in Old High German, all 
of which would be useful to a student of English 
philology. Professor Jackson has one course (two 
hours a week throughout the year) in " Anglo-Saxon 
Language and Historical English Grammar " ; an- 
other (two hours a week, half the year only) on 
" Anglo-Saxon Poetry " ; a third ( two hours a week, 
half the year only), on " Early and Middle English 
from the Twelfth to the Fifteenth Century." Pro- 
fessor Price has a course (two hours a week through- 
out the year) on " Anglo-Saxon Prose and Historical 
English Syntax." 

In the history of English literature, Professor 
Price has three courses (each two hours a week 
throughout the year), one on "Shakespeare: lan- 
guage, versification, and method of dramatic po- 
etry "; another on " Chaucer : language, versifica- 
tion, and method of narrative poetry "; and a third 
on "The Poetry of Tennyson, Browning, and Mat- 
thew Arnold." A course on the " English drama 
to the closing of the theatres (1640) exclusive of 
Shakespeare" (two hours a week throughout the 
year) is given conjointly by Professors Jackson and 
Woodberry. Professor Woodberry gives four other 
courses; two (each one hour a week for half the 
year) on "Spenser and the Elizabethan poets, ex- 
clusive of drama," and on " Milton and the Caro- 
line poets "; and two (each two hours a week through- 
out the year) on "Eighteenth Century Literature" 
and on "Nineteenth Century Literature." This last 
course considers only British authors, and therefore 
it conflicts in no way with my own course (two hours 
a week throughout the year) on " American Litera- 
ture." 

Perhaps these three divisions, rhetoric, English 
language, and English literature, include all the 
courses which can fairly be called English; but 
closely allied to the first and to the third of these 
divisions is literature, literature at large, inde- 
pendent of any given tongue, just as linguistics is 
independent of any given language, and going from 
one tongue to another, just as linguistics goes from 
one language to another. In this sense, the study 
of literature is the tracing of the evolution of liter- 
ary form and of the development of criticism as 
masterpieces came into existence. In this depart- 
ment Professor Woodberry has two courses, one 
(two hours a week throughout the year) on the 
"History and Theory of Criticism; Plato, Aris- 
totle, Horace, Quintillian, Sidney, Boileau, Dry- 
den, Lessing, Coleridge "; and another, open only 
to students who have taken the first, on " The Prac- 
tice of Criticism," a review of the greater works of 
literature, with specific original inquiries in partic- 
ular epochs. And I have two courses also, one ( two 
hours a week throughout the year) on "The Epochs 
of the Drama: Greek, Latin, Spanish, English, 
French, German "; and another (one hour a week

From the foregoing paragraphs the reader can 
see how fully English is treated at Columbia Col- 
lege, and from how many sides it is approached ; 
and he can judge for himself whether there is any 
unjust discrimination against either the linguistic 
half of the subject or the literary. I have to add 
only that in no course in the history of English lit- 
erature, or in the history of literature, is any text- 
book used so far as I am aware. All the profes- 
sors are agreed in insisting that the student shall 
get at first hand his knowledge of the authors con- 
sidered in turn, and that he shall from time to time 
prepare essays of his own involving individual re- 



search.

SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It would be premature to estimate the influence of 
the " Report of the Committee on Secondary School 
Studies," discussed editorially in your issue of January 
16, but it is not too soon to indicate some of its char- 
acteristics that justify misgivings. Those happy ones 
who can forget their securom agere cevom long enough 
to become aware of the total depravity of secondary 
education, and to conceive a missionary zeal for its sal- 
vation, should begin by understanding the causes of its 
present unregenerate condition; yet these causes are 
just what the Committee and the Conferences ignore. 
Some of us do not agree that " the most defective part 
of our education is that of secondary schools "; we be- 
lieve that it is incomparably the most important and the 
most unmanageable part, and that we who are engaged in 
it understand its deficiencies and its difficulties far bet- 
ter than the Committee and the Conferences are ever 
likely to note them; and we despair of any effectual 
growth in grace until true causes are recognized and 
true remedies are applied. Our conviction is that, tak- 
ing into consideration the relative conditions and pro- 
portionsage, maturity, and training on the pupil's 
side, and independence, facilities, control, incentives, on 
that of the college the result in real education as dis- 
tinguished from technical skill in any given case is 
more largely due to the secondary school than to the 
college a result proceeding from the fact that, in spite 
of all their peculiar difficulties, from which colleges are 
exempted, the schools do teach and the colleges do not. 
In this general connection, the Minority Report of the 
Committee is very significant as exhibiting the astound- 
ing theory of educational values accepted by the Com- 
mittee and as intimating the haste with which such con- 
clusions were reached. 

More potent than defects of method, lack of coordi- 
nation, and incompetence of teachers, are the "evil times" 
on which we are fallen. An ever-lessening school-year, 
multiplying holidays, interrupted health of pupils, "prac- 
tical" considerations, social distractions, everything 



in the air is against the serious work of schools, public as 
well as private, provincial as well as metropolitan, with of 
course some difference in degree.* Comparisons with 
the systems of foreign countries are irrelevant and mis- 
leading, because they are not thorough-going: in fact, 
as cited they do not necessarily prove their point. In 
the United States at present, a forty-weeks' programme 
anchored to abstractions is a very different thing from a 
forty-weeks' programme dependent on distractions. 

Speaking broadly, and with some exception as to 
strictly graded schools, secondary education is what col- 
leges have begotten or adopted: colleges have brought 
the schools to do, and now they flout them too. Some 
comments and suggestions of the Conferences, whether 
intentionally or not, imply this recognition; but the Com- 
mittee of Ten, who, as auditors and interpreters, might 
have been expected to collect and organize these hints, 
weighing their significance and pointing the appropriate 
moral, are too scientific for " traces," too dignified for 
innuendo, too blithe for self-reproach; and we look in 
vain for the desiderated nos consoles desumus. Yet it 
is absolutely just for schools that have long felt the 
cramping conditions of college requirements, operating 
as almost the only definite standards of higher (as dis- 
tinguished from " practical " or technical) education, to 
insist on having their results criticised in accordance 
with the number and volume and character of those re- 
quirements as used for examination purposes. 

This accountability of colleges is amply illustrated in 
this document. Of the members of the Conferences, 
forty-eight were college-men and forty-two were school- 
men. The easy assumption of propriety in this distribu- 
tion is enough in itself to show that, in the eyes of our 
Colossi, we must be underlings even in the measure of 
our authorized aspirations ; but our subserviency is far 
greater. Of the forty r two school-men, almost two- 
thirds were principals; so that it is fair to assume that 
not more than half of the total number of school-men 
have been actual teachers so recently and so largely, or 
have otherwise lived in such close and unbroken rela- 
tions with the real work of teaching, as to be teachers in 
any true sense. The proper ratio would have been 
far different: there was need of only enough college- 
men to formulate their special observations from vari- 
ous points of view of weakness in school-work, their ex- 
pectations for the proper prosecution of college studies 
as conceived and designed, their remorse for past igno- 
rance and indifference as to the work and the embarrass- 
ments of schools, and their acquiescence in a reasonable 
adaptation of their own crotchets to the possibilities of 
secondary education at the present time. Decisions 
and recommendations of practicability should have been 
left to actual teachers of tried success as such, disposed 
by education and experiences and sympathy to aspire 
even when constrained to temporary contentment. Teach- 
ing is a practical matter, with conditions of system and 
sequence and completeness and repetition and illumina- 
tion, from one or all of which most college-teachers' 
(though not otherwise as excusable as Lowell in Dante) 
consider themselves exempted by a change of venue 
never open to actual teachers, who are accountable to 
tests they can seldom forecast and often consider irra- 
tional, and who are to a great extent dependent on suc- 
cess in arbitrary examinations for livelihood and repu- 
tation. 

" The Sun " of Feb. 12 represents certain New York physi- 
cians as insisting that schools should not begin their daily 
sessions till 10 o'clock.

It is to be hoped that, at President Baker's recom- 
mendation, the National Council will hold itself respon- 
sible for further investigation of the data furnished by 
the Conference. Meantime, these remarks are offered 
from a private school: if this Report has more specific 
application to public schools and trusteed academies, 
their condition reflects seriously on the recent argument 
of that member of the Committee who insists on the 
public supervision of all institutions of learning.

"THE 'STAR' SYSTEM IN PERIODICALS" AGAIN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With the rest of your readers, I greatly enjoyed the 
article entitled " The ' Star ' System in Periodicals," in 
your issue of Jan. 16. But there is one point waiting 
to be touched upon, it seems to me; another abnormal 
development of the " star " system, not referred to in 
the paper. It wittily describes the contributions of the 
specialist; but what is to be said when the specialist in 
one field poaches upon the domain of another ? Let 
the distinguished and erudite Professor Pterodactyl dis- 
course as profoundly and as prosily as he will upon his 
chosen subject of Palaeontology; and let the discussion 
between himself and the equally distinguished Profes- 
sor Trilobite wax hot and incomprehensible: there are 
students of the subject, doubtless, self-disciplined suf- 
ficiently to follow on, albeit afar off, with some degree 
of interest and appreciation. But, sad to relate, some 
fatal morning the eminent Pterodactyl receives a flat- 
tering note from the editor of a prominent Review, con- 
taining an urgent invitation to contribute to it a paper 
upon " The Situation in Hawaii," with an exposition of 
his views on annexing the Antipodes, and a few prac- 
tical suggestions relative to queens and the sugar bounty. 
Upon the self-same evil day the learned Trilobite finds 
in his morning's mail a polite letter from the editor of 
a rival Review requesting that he participate in a sym- 
posium with three other distinguished gentlemen (they 
are, it appears, an M. C. from Missouri, a prominent 
English brewer who happens to be temporarily in this 
country looking about with an eye to speculation, and a 
very celebrated major-general who since " the late un- 
pleasantness " has spent most of the time in African 
travel and exploration) who are to discuss severally and 
collectively the present attitude towards Realism in Fic- 
tion. The editor is certain that the views of such dis- 
tinguished men upon a subject of so much popular in- 
terest cannot fail to suggest much of value to the great 
reading public of America. These two excellent and, up 
to this time, entirely respectable professors are at first a 
trifle shocked by these suggestions; recovering duly, 
they smile a dreary smile of conscious frailty, ponder, 
conceive, labor, and are delivered respectively of anom- 
alous and grotesque monstrosities, which, together with 
similar hapless productions from other sources, disfigure 
and obscure the pages of the magazines. Now this is 
very absurd, and should of course be touched upon in 
any discussion of the " star " system. Many of our pe- 
riodicals now advertise the name of their contributors 
rather than the titles of the articles; and the competi- 
tion of editorship is in some quarters largely a smart ri- 
valry in securing noted names. This is legitimate enough 
when the author and his work may be identified as re- 
lated; but to-day, in authorship as in every department 
of human industry, man's field is not the world. Spec- 



ulation of course invades the sanctum, and brilliant Na- 
poleons of editing assure us that there is everything in 
"a name." Is this a phase of development, or is it a 

f ad? WILLIAM EDWARDS.

THE DECUMAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his recently published letters (Vol. II., pp. 55- 
56) Mr. Lowell refers to the difficulties of some of his 
critics in relation to a word occurring in " The Cathe- 
dral,"- 

"... shocks of surf that clorab and fell, 
Spume-sliding down the baffled cfectraan," 

and attempts the genealogy of the word, finding it in 
several Latin writers (fluctus decumanus*), but being 
unable to name any English author who had used it in 
this sense. " I think I shall probably come across the 
word somewhere in English again," Mr. Lowell writes, 
" where I no doubt met with it years ago. A word 
that cleaves to the memory is always a good word 
that's the way to test them." 

It will interest readers of Lowell to note that the 
word decuman, meaning the tenth wave, is given in the 
new " Century Dictionary " with quotations from two 
minor English writers. The locus classicus in English, 
however, for the discussion of the phenomenon itself, is 
in that delightful repository of all questions strange and 
wonderful, the Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Vulgar Er- 
rors, of Sir Thomas Browne. See his works (ed. Wil- 
kin (London, 1878, II., 269-271), where quotations in 
illustration of the topic from several more modern 
writers also are given by the editor. I find elsewhere 
also a quotation ascribed to Burke: 

" At length, tumbling from the Gallic coast, the victorious 
tenth wave shall ride like the boar over all the rest." 
And in Tennyson (" The Coming of Arthur ") there is 
a reference to the ninth wave a variation doubtless 
due to the two different methods of enumeration, whether 
inclusive or exclusive: 

"And then the two 

Dropt to the cove, and -watch'd the great sea fall, 
Wave after wave, each mightier than the last, 
Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep 
And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged 
Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame." 
But probably the allusion is not an unusual one in 
English poetry. FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER.

A TIME-HONORED MISPRINT. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

In your issue of Jan. 16 a zealous Scotchman uses the 
word " willie-waught " in a poem in honor of Burns. 
Alas ! our carelessly-printed editions of Burns have de- 
ceived one of the very elect. Cuthbertson's Complete 
Glossary to Burns knows nothing of the word. Mr. 
William Scott Douglas says in his edition of Burns (Vol. 
II., p. 175), at the close of a discussion of this "ghost- 
word " : " In short, < willie-waught ' is nonsense, but ' gude- 
willie ' or ' ill-willie ' is a compound adjective in every- 
day use."

" And we '11 tak a right gude-willie wanght."

RECOLLECTIONS AXD SKETCHES OF 
SOME LITERARY FOLK.* 

Mr. Francis Espinasse's volume of " Recol- 
lections and Sketches " forms an exceedingly 
entertaining and valuable collection of literary 
memorabilia perhaps the freshest and best 
one, all in all, that has come to our notice of 
late. The author, a Frenchman by blood, a 
Scot by birth, and a Londoner by adoption, 
seems to have had a sort of genius for falling in 
with people who, as Mrs. Leo Hunter phrased 
it, " are celebrated for their works and talents." 
Fortunately, a turn for noting and mentally 
storing up salient personal traits and pungent 
odds and ends of talk has enabled him to make 
the most of his Boswellian opportunities in a 
Boswellian way. Nearly two-thirds of the book 
are devoted to " The Carlyles and a Segment 
of their Circle," the remaining captions being : 
" The British Museum Library Fifty Years 
Ago, and After," " Concerning the Organiza- 
tion of Literature," " George Henry Lewes 
and George Eliot," " James Hannay and his 
Friends," " Leigh Hunt and his Second Jour- 
nal," " Literary Journalism," " Lord Beacons- 
field and his Minor Biographers," etc. The 
contents of the volume are based on a series of 
articles, which appeared monthly in "The Book- 
man " during the two years from its commence- 
ment in 1891. These have been considerably 
enlarged ; and the chapters entitled " Literary 
Journalism" and "Later Edinburgh Memoirs" 
are now printed for the first time. 

In his opening chapter, which is devoted to 
Early Reminiscences, the author recounts his 
boyish impressions of certain celebrities of a 
past generation, among them Sir Walter Scott, 
Thomas Campbell, and Wordsworth. Of Sir 
Walter he is at least able to say Virgilium 
vidi tantum, having enjoyed a fugitive glimpse 
of the author of " Waverley " while a pupil at 
the Melrose preparatory school : 

" One day I was out walking with a governess or 
other female guardian, when an open carriage, with an 
elderly gentleman sitting in it reading, and a boy on a 
pony trotting by its side, was seen coming along a bend 
in the road, so that we had them in full view. ' Look,' 
said my companion, ' that is Sir Walter Scott and his 
grandson.' Look I did at the author of my favorite 
' Tales of a Grandfather,' and especially at the enviable 
,boy for whom they were written, to whom they were 
addressed, and who seemed to me more or less de- 
formed." 

* LITERARY RECOLLECTIONS AND SKETCHES. By Francis 
Espinasse. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co.| 



Of Campbell he obtained a nearer view. It 
was during the poet's final visit to Edinburgh, 
where, as a distinguished bard and a " brither 
Scot," he was much feted and caressed by the 
higher order of Amphitryons, as well as by 
members of the Town Council and the like 
" bit burgher bodies." One of the latter class, 
a Bailie, having asked Campbell to dinner, the 
author, as a lad of known parts and enthusiasm 
for poetry and poets, was invited to put in an 
appearance with the dessert, that he might 
feast his eyes on the Bard of Hope. There 
seems to have been the usual disparity between 
the young ideal and the actual : 

" The guests were chiefly Edinburgh ministers of the 
Kirk, one of them being the long-headed, pawky Dr. Lee, 
then in charge of one of the most important city churches, 
and afterwards Principal of the University of Edin- 
burgh. Among them, and a striking contrast to his 
fellow-guests, sat the poet, a spruce little gentleman, 
with finely-cut features, in a gay and talkative mood, 
which became more so as he made an end of glass upon 
glass of brandy and water. He told amusing story after 
story, to the great delectation of his listeners. Young 
as I was, I noticed that some of the poet's anecdotes 
verged on the improper, and that in these cases, Dr. 
Lee's countenance wore an embarassed look, as if, while 
bound to smile, he as a cleric fell; it to be his duty to 
look grave. So the evening wore on until Campbell 
had told his last story, finished his last glass of brandy 
and water, and it was time for seniors, much more for 
juniors, to take their homeward way." 

It was during a holiday sojourn at Kendal, 
in the Lake District, that Mr. Espinasse en- 
countered Wordsworth. He made the usual 
pilgrimage to Rydal Mount, and was amiably 
received by the proprietor, whom he describes 
as being then a man of near seventy, hale and 
erect, and looking, when he had donned his 
Tam-o'-Shauter bonnet and plaid, like a Low- 
land farmer of the better class. Of Words- 
worth's features, that which struck the young 
visitor most was his nose a member massive 
enough to have captivated Mr. Walter Shandy 
himself. Altogether, concludes Mr. Espinasse, 
" His countenance had not to my mind that refinement 
which is visible in his portraits. . . . Before we parted, 
something that I said may have betrayed a hankering 
after a literary life. At any rate, he warned me against 
it, and spoke of what he had known of suffering among 
friends of his drudging for and dependent on ' book- 
sellers.' He advised me to be a 'surgeon.'" 

It was in 1841 that Mr. Espinasse was first 
drawn, as it were, into the Carlylean orbit. 
He had read with delight the " French Revo- 
lution," " Sartor Resartus," and the more mys- 
tical deliverances on the literature of Germany, 
and had been led thereby into certain mild dab- 
blings in German philosophy. The upshot of 
it all was that (despite the ministrations of

*' long-headed, pawky Dr. Lee " of the Kirk) 
he became disquieted about his soul. The half- 
digested Hegelism, Fichteism, Schellingism, 
assorting ill with his home-bred Calvinism, 
brought on a fit of spiritual indigestion, and 
he determined forthwith to consult Mr. Car- 
lyle as the man best fitted to resolve his meta- 
physical doubts. Surely, he perhaps reflected, 
one who had written so finely and prophetically 
of " the Immensities," " the Silences," " the 
Abysmal Nothingnesses," " the Eternal Vera- 
cities," could say much to the purpose ; so he in- 
dited a note to the Sage of Ecclefechan asking 
him plumply " for a solution of the mystery of 
existence." Nor was the oracle silent. Thomas 
Carlyle was, perhaps, of all men of his time, 
the one most profoundly and painfully con- 
vinced of the hopelessness of the question so 
artlessly put to him. But the confidence shown 
by his unknown disciple was flattering, not to 
say touching ; and to the surprise and delight 
of the petitioner there presently came a letter, 
kindly and helpful, though scarcely satisfac- 
tory as a " solution " of the " mystery " afore- 
said. We subjoin what seems to be the pith 
of the philosopher's reply : 

" It is many years since I ceased reading German or 
any other metaphysics, and gradually came to discern 
that I had happily got done with that matter altogether. 
By what steps, series of books, and other influences such 
result was brought about, it would now be extremely 
difficult to say. Few books stand prominently with me 
above the general dimness. ... I may say further 
that after all the Fichteisms, Schellingisms, Hegelisms, 
I still understand Kant to be the grand novelty, the 
prime author of the new spiritual world, of whom all 
the others are but superficial, transient modifications. If 
you do decide to penetrate into this matter, what bet- 
ter can you do than vigorously set to the Kritik der 
reinen Veznunft, a very attainable book, and resolutely 
study it and re-study it till you understand it ? You 
will find it actually capable of being understood, rigor- 
ously sequent, like a book of mathematics; labor that 
pays itself; really one of the best metaphysical studies 
that I know of. Once master of Kant, you have at- 
tained what I reckon most precious, perhaps alone pre- 
cious in that multifarious business of German philos- 
ophy: namely, deliverance from the fatal incubus of 
Scotch or French philosophy, with its mechanisms and 
its Atheisms, and be able perhaps to wend on your way 
leaving both of them behind you. . . . For the rest, 
let it be no disappointment if, after all study, you do 
not learn ' what we are ' ; nay, if you discover that met- 
aphysics cannot by any possibility teach us such a result, 
or even that metaphysics is a kind of disease, and the 
inquiry itself a kind of disease. We shall never know 
' what we are ' ; on the other hand, we can always 
partly know what beautiful and noble things we are 
fit to do, and that is the grand inquiry for us. The 
Hebrew Psalmist said, I am fearfully and wonderfully 
made.' No Kant or Hegel, as I take it, can do much 
more than say the like, in the wider, complicated dia- 
lect we now have." 



That Carlyle's estimates of the British men 
of letters who were his contemporaries did not 
err on the side of over-appreciation is manifest 
in Mr. Espinasse's chapter on his " Literary 
Table-Talk." Some of the most popular of 
them were poets and novelists, and Carlyle, de- 
spite his reverence for Goethe, Schiller, and 
Jean Paul, waged perpetual war against metre 
and fiction. So far did he carry this dislike 
(real or feigned) that the author heard him 
one day grumbling because the pleasure he had 
hoped to derive from a translation of some In- 
dian drama, by " a man of strong Hindoo gen- 
ius," had been " spoilt " by a metrical render- 
ing. " Mainly, perhaps," shrewdly observes 
Mr. Espinasse, " this aversion from poetry and 
fiction was due not merely to Carlyle's love of 
reality, but to his own comparative failure in 
both." 

Carlyle did not, it seems, rate Wordsworth 
very high as a poet, whatever his opinion of 
him as a man may have been. " Put ^iEschy- 
lus among those hills," he exclaimed, " and he 
will say something worth listening to ! " Mr. 
Espinasse surmises that his general depreciation 
of Wordsworth was partly the result of a son- 
net of the poet's evidently directed against him- 
self and his " The French Revolution,"* for he 
adds, 

" Great as was Carlyle's intellectual integrity, his es- 
timates of his contemporaries, literary and unliterary, 
were often in a perceptible degree colored by personal 
feeling." 

Certainly, however, no inimical feeling of 
that kind influenced him in his inadequate rat- 
ing of Tennyson's exquisite verse. For Ten- 
nyson, the man, he had a real affection, "though 
he liked him as a companion chiefly because, 
he told me, he found ' Alfred ' thus he always 
spoke of him ' an intelligent listener.' '" Pa- 
tient and much-enduring " listener " were per- 
haps nearer the mark. Of the fine " Princess," 
Carlyle said curtly that it " had everything but 
common-sense " (a stricture, by-the-bye, which 
an eminent Frenchman has since passed on his 
own " French Revolution "), and our author 
found him, one forenoon, 

"Deep in the Acta Sanctorum, and full of the story 
of the dealings of an early Christian missionary with 
some Scandinavian and heathen potentate. ' Alfred,' 
he declared, ' would be much better employed in mak- 
ing such an episode interesting and beautiful than in 
cobbling his odes,' the occupation in which, when visit- 
ing him sometime before, Carlyle had found him en-

Reckless audacity extol, and jeer 
At consciences perplexed with scruples nice," etc.

gaged, and with the futility of which he had then and 
there reproached him." 

Mrs. Browning, it seems, did not take so 
quietly as Tennyson the philosopher's rather 
meddlesome protests against verse-making. 
Having received from him a letter adjuring her 
to forsake the evil of her poetical ways, she 
wrote him so touching and sensible a rejoinder 
that " I had," Carlyle confessed, " to draw in 
my horns." 

For that limb of the " Dandiacal Body," the 
author of "Pelham," Carlyle evinced much 
contempt, calling him a " poor fribble," and 
approving his own plain-spoken spouse's still 
more vigorous epithet, " a lanthorn - jawed 
quack." For Dickens, on the other hand, he 
had much personal liking. He declared that he 
was the only man of his time in whose writings 
genuine cheerfulness was to be found, and com- 
pared favorably his sunny geniality with the 
" terrible cynicism " of Thackeray. 

Mr. Espinasse notes a curiously characteris- 
tic judgment of Carlyle's respecting Ranke 
whose elaborate Neun Bilcher JPreussischer 
Geschichte he pronounced " a complete fail- 
ure." He had, it seems, once seen Ranke rum- 
maging among the manuscripts in the Brit- 
ish Museum, and had noted, with his usual 
keen eye for personal defects, 
" That something, either congenital or the result of ex- 
ternal injury, was so much the matter with an upper 
section of Ranke 's dorsal region that he had to link the 
peccant parts together with an iron hook." 

So, agreeably to a pet theory of his as to the 
bearing of a man's bodily peculiarities upon 
his intellect, he at once pronounced the emi- 
nent Teuton " a broken-backed man," and pro- 
ceeded to draw inferences from his physical 
affliction to his book. " Broken-backed man," 
ergo, weak-backed book, seems to have been 
the not very sequent enthymeme. Oddly 
enough, in Mr. Carlyle's own case, a kindred 
analogy is often drawn, the maligned world 
professing to have found much of the dyspep- 
tic censor's stomach in his writings. Our au- 
thor himself rather neatly observes, " Much in 
Carlyle and what flowed from him was, as 
Goethe said of Schiller, ' pathological.' ' 

Carlyle's oral criticism on the opening vol- 
umes of Froude's History was curt and pithy : 
" Meritorious, but too much raw material "; 
while the impression left upon him by Thiers's 
" French Revolution " was that its author was 
" a man without a conscience." That his lat- 
ter-day literary judgments were sometimes at 
variance with his early enthusiasms is attested 



in the case of Fichte whom he once charac- 
terized in his Essays as " a colossal and ada- 
mantine spirit, standing erect and clear like a 
Cato Major among degenerate men, fit to have 
been the teacher of the Stoa, and to have dis- 
covered beauty and virtue in the groves of 
Academe." Twenty years later, however, says 
Mr. Espinasse, when 

" He had been reading a new volume in a series of 
translations from Fichte's works, he pronounced, to my 
great astonishment, the lauded Fichte of earlier years 
to be ' a thick-skinned fellow ! ' " 

His appreciation of and gratitude to Kant, on 
the contrary, remained unimpaired. " Kant," 
he declared, " taught me that I had a soul as well 
as a body " a tribute which, to say the least, 
was not flattering to the logic of his own pre- 
Kantian spiritual pastors and masters. 

Owing to his prophetic character Carlyle was 
much tormented by counsel-seeking bores, by all 
sorts of people asking all sorts of questions 
with all the confidence shown by Captain Cut- 
tle in the oracular Bunsby. The most pesti- 
lent pilgrims to the Chelsea tripod were, we re- 
gret to learn, Americans, a fact which led their 
victim to write his famous sentence about the 
millions of transatlantic bores who had been 
brought into the world with unexampled rapid- 
ity. One American cleric, our author remem- 
bers, 

" Half-forced his way into the house to insist on Car- 
lyle's explaining to him difficulties which had occurred 
to him in studying ' the moral character of Goorty ' 
such, according to Carlyle, was his pronunciation of 
Goethe's name. All he got out of Carlyle was a recom- 
mendation to restudy, in ' Goorty's ' own writings, the 
' moral character,' the anomalies of which had perplexed 
him." 

Of A. Bronson Alcott's historic visit to Car- 
lyle we find no mention in this unflattering 
connection ; but he certainly must have pro- 
pounded some " unmitigated staggerers " to the 
oracle. 

From Alcott to Emerson the mental transi- 
tion is easy ; and we shall pass on to our au- 
thor's capital chapter on " Emerson in En- 
gland." His manner in the lecture-room, says 
Mr. Espinasse, was one of perfect serenity : 

" To the public success or failure of his lectures he 
appeared to be profoundly indifferent, a mood to which 
his experiences in American lecture-rooms had habit- 
uated him. He told me, with perfect equanimity, that 
at home he was accustomed to see hearers, after listen- 
ing to him a little, walk out of the room, as much as to 
say that they had had enough of him." 

Perhaps the " perfect equanimity " was the 
fruit of the lecturer's Platonic opinions as to 
the capacity for higher truth of his vanishing

auditors. Emerson would seem to have chosen, 
on the whole, rather an odd circle of associates 
while in England. Before leaving Manchester 
he gave a dinner party to which he invited 
" A strange collection of mystics, poets, prose-rhap- 
sodists, editors, school-masters, ex-Unitarian ministers, 
and cultivated manufacturers, the only bond of union 
among them being a common regard and respect for 
Emerson. . . . After the prandial and post-prandial 
babblement, to which our host as usual contributed noth- 
ing, he gave a serene close to the evening by reading to us 
his lecture on Plato." 

It may be added that one of the guests on this 
hilarious occasion was a vegetarian, an apos- 
tle of what Carlyle once called the " dom'd 
potato-gospel," for whom a separate dinner 
of herbs was considerately served. The account 
of this " function " prepares us for our author's 
statement that the Englishman in whom Em- 
erson seemed most interested was one Thomas 
Taylor, Platonist and Neo-pagan, a crack- 
brained enthusiast whom some visitors once 
found kneeling before a silver shrine of Mer- 
cury ! 

" Taylor lived in Walworth, whither Emerson told 
me that he made a pilgrimage the only literary pil- 
grimage which I knew him to make in London in 
search of memorials of this reviver of the worship of 
the gods of antiquity." 

Carlyle used to relate with much amusement 
an incident reported to him by a friend who 
had visited " the seraphic man " at Concord : 

" Emerson's little boy being very fretful and tearful, 
the optimistic parent took the urchin in his arms, and 
said, caressing him, ' I will love the devil out of him.' 
Garlyle evidently thought that for such an extrusion a 
sterner mode of treatment would have been more effect- 
ive or appropriate." 

Possibly something in the way of a sound birch- 
ing would have been the Ecclefechan mode of 
exorcism. 

Mr. Espinasse had a long talk with Carlyle 
about one of Emerson's Edward Street lectures. 
*' When I spoke," he says, 

" Of the high ethical ideal which Emerson held up to 
us, Carlyle replied that Emerson's ethics consisted chiefly 
of < prohibitions.' . . . Mrs. Carlyle was more dissatis- 
fied than her husband with Emerson's ethics. Dilating 
in his high-flown optimistic way on the ultimate triumph 
of good over evil, the lecturer went to the length of 
saying that even when in a haunt of sensual vice, un- 
mentionable to ears polite (though Emerson called it by 
its plain English name), ' man is still tending upwards,' 
or words to that effect. Mrs. Carlyle's moral indigna- 
tion at this statement knew no bounds, and for some 
time she could scarcely speak of Emerson with patience." 

On the much-discussed, if not very import- 
ant, relations between Carlyle and his wife our 
author has little to say, but that little is to the 
point. Men are rarely heroes to their valets, 



or, a fortiori, to their wives who enjoy, it 
will be admitted, even better opportunities for 
close observation ; and the wife, in the present 
case, happened to have an unusually keen eye 
for contrasts between theory and conduct. Mrs. 
Carlyle did not, in fact, always take her dog- 
matical spouse as seriously as he liked to be 
taken ; and our author notes her readiness to 
tell " before company " anecdotes of him which 
made him appear just a little ridiculous : 

"Carlyle was full of inconsistencies, especially in the 
contrast between his doctrine of the sacredness of silence 
and his own incessant talk. This gave Mrs. Carlyle a 
handle, of which, when irritated, she was not slow to 
avail herself, for comment on the difference between 
her husband's preachment and his practice. Once when 
he was declaiming against the love of perpetual loco- 
motion, and insisting on the duty of staying where you 
are, the little lady bowled him out very neatly by citing 
two lines from his own translation of a distich in Wil- 
helm Meister's Wanderjahre 

' To give room for wandering is it 
That the world was made so wide.' " 

The key to Mrs. Carlyle's occasional petu- 
lance, is not, perhaps, far to seek. The author 
recalls the " emphasis " (" it seemed afterwards 
a little significant," he adds) with which she 
once refused his request to sing " Auld Robin 
Gray." 

We have done scant justice to the range and 
variety of Mr. Espinasse's book, which we once 
more commend as a capital collection of liter- 
ary anecdotes and ana.

GREEK POETRY AND LIFE.* 

Criticism has long since exhausted the vo- 
cabulary of approbation in appraising the suc- 
cessive performances of Professor Jebb. He 
is the ideal product of the English system of 
education, and he easily bears away all the first 
prizes. His faculty of assimilation is unparal- 
lelled, and like Mr. Andrew Lang, he has set his 
mark on everything. He has written the best 
copy of Greek verses (his Bologna Ode), the 
best imitation of Tacitean prose, the best book 
on the Attic Orators, the best Introduction to 
Homer, the best volume in the " English Men 
of Letters " series (the Bentley), and the best 
and only edition of Sophocles. We are waiting 
to hear that he has given the best University 
Extension Lecture and made the best speech 
in Parliament. Meanwhile he sends us a pleas- 
ant reminder of his recent visit to this country,

in the shape of the best course of lectures on 
Greek poetry the lectures which he delivered 
in 1892 on the Percy Turnbull Memorial Foun- 
dation in the Johns Hopkins University. The 
eight lectures fill one neat little volume. On 
the fly-leaf the author has set a pretty Greek 
elegiac stanza, which may be roughly Englished 
as follows : 

Like to a rose that withers in the leaf 

Thy death the ninth spring's threshold not yet crossed. 
Now to the Muse each spring thy parents' grief 

Offers this wreath in memory of the lost. 

A brief preface expresses the desire that this 
volume may take its place in a series deriving 
unity from the Turnbull foundation, the series 
initiated by Mr. Stedman's " Nature and Ele- 
ments of Poetry," and to be continued next 
spring by Mr. Norton's eagerly anticipated lec- 
tures on Dante. 

We have the author's warrant for turning 
first to the last chapter, on the " Permanent 
Power of Greek Poetry." It is the lecture 
which he selected to read before the Twentieth 
Century Club in Chicago, and for publication 
in the "Atlantic Monthly." Its leading thought 
is an idea already illustrated by Professor Jebb 
in his " Attic Orators." The truth, the variety, 
the permanent power of Greek poetry and ora- 
tory are due in large measure to the fact that 
they grew up in immediate and vital contact 
with the life of the people. All other litera- 
tures (with the possible exception of the Eliz- 
abethan drama) have been produced by a cul- 
tivated class, a literary remnant dwelling as 
sojourners and aliens among toiling millions 
who knew them not. They have been the ex- 
pression of schools, cliques, and coteries. The 
literature of Greece only was truly autoctho- 
nous. The poets and orators of Athens could 
repeat, in respect of the rich soil of human life 
in which they had their roots, that proud Athen- 
ian boast : 

"All races but one are as aliens engrafted or sown, 
Strange children and changelings, but we, our mother, thine 
own." 

Let not the heralds of a free untrammelled lit- 
erature of the Mississippi Valley, broad as our 
prairies and untamed as our buffaloes, derive 
comfort from this thought. If literature and 
life are to meet in fruitful contact, the people 
must come half-way. The average man whom 
the Athenian poets and orators addressed sur- 
passed in mental power, according to Mr. Gal- 
ton's estimates, the average Member of Parlia- 
ment. When he sat on a jury he did not need 
to be propitiated by the quaint mixture of slang 
and " highfalutin " which a distinguished ex- 



governor of Massachusetts thought it necessary 
to employ in a recent celebrated case in order 
to separate himself from sophistical " literary 
fellers " in the minds of the twelve good men 
and true. And to amuse him in the theatre it 
was not necessary to resort to " Texas Steers," 
" Holes in the Ground," or " Mr. Barnes of 
New York." Don't be afraid to make fine 
points, the chorus cry, in the " Frogs " of Aris- 
tophanes ; the audience are clever enough. 

Thus, as Professor Jebb elsewhere finely 
says, the poetry of the Greeks was the index 
of their capacity, and not merely like the po- 
etry of the English-speaking race, the flower 
of their spirit. It was not only inspired by life, 
but it was also regulated by life ; and to this it 
owes its immunity from affectation and unre- 
ality, and from the false sentiment which "may 
pass muster in the study, but which is inevit- 
ably betrayed by its own un veracity when it is 
spoken aloud before witnesses whose minds are 
sane." " In such an art we find lessons which 
no lapse of time can make obsolete and which 
no multiplication of modern interests can make 
superfluous." 

In a few brief pregnant paragraphs, Pro- 
fessor Jebb goes on to contrast this quality of 
classical Greek literature with the artificial 
product of Alexandria and Rome, pausing only 
to pay a tribute of warm enthusiasm to The- 
ocritus, the last genuinely inspired poet of 
Greece. He then touches lightly but suggest- 
ively on the Hellenic influences in modern lit- 
erature, in Goethe, Schiller, Milton, Keats, and 
Mr. William Morris, and on the too familiar 
antithesis of Hellenism and Hebraism. Keats, 
he truly says (after Arnold), is essentially an 
Elizabethan ; " his manner, even in treating 
Greek themes, was not Greek except occasion- 
ally and for brief spaces." One hesitates to 
differ from Professor Jebb ; but it is not easy 
to accept the dictum that the most Greek thing 
in Keats is " his vivid spontaneous sympathy 
with the life of eternal nature " as shown, for 
example, in the " Ode to a Nightingale." Surely 
Keats's interpretation of nature is " Celtic," as 
Arnold would say, rather than Greek. The 
truly Greek element in Keats's work, I think, 
is a certain monumental plasticity of style re- 
vealed in occasional touches only ; the too rare 
expression of a mood borne in on him when he 
contemplated the Elgin marbles, and contrasted 
their everlasting superhuman calm with the 
breathing human passion that left his own heart 
high-sorrowful and cloyed. Such lines, I mean, 
as these : 



1894.]

" And charioting foremost in the envious race 
Like a young Jove with calm uneager face." 

Or these : 

" She would have ta'en 
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck, 
Or with a finger stayed Ixion's wheel." 

Or these : 

" What little town by river or sea shore 
Or mountain built with peaceful citadel 
Is emptied of this folk this pious morn ? " 

Or the second stanza of the " Ode to Autumn," 
which, but for a touch of Elizabethan luxuri- 
ance, might have been taken directly from 
Theocritus. 

Very admirable, too, is Professor Jebb's 
sketch, in the introductory lecture, of the " Dis- 
tinctive qualities of the Greek race as expressed 
by Homer," shown on a dark background of the 
pre-Hellenic Egyptian, Assyrian, and Phoani- 
cian civilization of the tenth century B. C. The 
Greek is free, natural, and human, from the 
moment of his first appearance on the stage of 
history a large-eyed Miranda-like child, look- 
ing out upon the brave new world that hath 
such people in it. The free expansion of his 
spirit was never checked by thralldoin to priests, 
kings, or conventions. And although, as the 
old Egyptian priest says in the " Timseus," 
this young people possessed no store of vener- 
able tradition that could vie with the hoary wis- 
dom of the East, they soon bettered their in- 
struction and left their teachers far in the rear. 

In reading the six more special chapters that 
fill up the body of the book, one must confess 
to a slight sense of disappointment. The feel- 
ing is an unjust one. Nowhere is there to be 
found a clearer or juster statement of the es- 
sential facts of the development of Greek poetry 
from Homer to Euripides. If there are few 
novelties and little spirit-stirring eloquence, it 
is because the writer's sober taste and unerring 
scholarship reject the tinsel of Mr. Syinonds's 
rhetoric and the wilful exaggerations of bril- 
liant partial fancies that enliven the pages of 
Mr. Ruskin, or Mr. Ernest Myers, or even oc- 
casionally of Matthew Arnold. 

What, within these limits, could Professor 
Jebb have told us of Homer that has not already 
been said by Arnold, or in his own incompara- 
ble little introduction to the study of Homer ? 
How could he write of the Greek lyric poets 
in one chapter more succinctly and soundly 
than he has done in his excellent primer, or 
more eloquently than Mr. Symonds in his 
44 Greek Poets " ? How could he hope to sur- 
pass in one lecture his own admirable paper on 
Pindar, published in the " Journal of Hellenic 



Studies " a few years ago ? What could he tell 
us about Sophocles that is not more adequately 
expressed in his great edition, and how could 
he improve on his own model article on Euri- 
pides in the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " ? He 
is in the position of the orator Isocrates, vainly 
striving to compete with his own earlier work. 
" The Panegyricus has beggared him." 

Here and there, however, one finds bits of 
criticism that deserve the emphasis of special 
notice ; as, for example, the spirited portrait- 
ure of the character of Achilles a blending 
of suggestions taken from Hegel and Mr. Rus- 
kin ; the remarks on the exquisite art with 
which Homer combines the human and divine 
agencies in the scene where Achilles pursues 
Hector around the walls of Troy ; and the sub- 
tle observations on the peculiar instinct for 
the picturesque which partly compensates in 
the " Odyssey " for the dramatic force of the 
" Iliad." The chapter on Pindar, who is natur- 
ally one of Professor Jebb's favorites, contains 
some fine renderings of four or five of the great 
tonic passages which every student of Greek lit- 
erature ought to know by heart. Pindar, Pro- 
fessor Jebb beautifully says, shows us the epic 
heroes under a new light, " neither that far-off 
though clear light, as of a fair sunset, which 
the lay of the minstrel shed around them in the 
palace of Alcinous, nor yet that searching sun^ 
shine of noontide which fell upon them in the 
theatre of Dionysus." The nearest analogue of 
a Pindaric ode in the manner of affecting the 
hearer, he tells us, is an oratorio such as the 
' ' Messiah " or " Israel in Egypt. ' ' We are happy 
to find one English scholar who does not tell us, 
like Cicero and Mr. Mahaffy, that we cannot 
know how the metres of Pindar sounded. The 
following words should be set up in letters of 
gold in every class-room where pedants drawl 
out Greek verse by the metronome and the rule 
of thumb: " For in the higher poetry, especially 
when it employs the grand style, the movement 
of every modern language is slower than the 
Greek." 

Professor Jebb has learned much from Mat- 
thew Arnold, as all his writings show. Why 
will he condescend to captious criticism of the 
great critic ? He must know that when Arnold 
describes Pindar as " the poet on whom above 
all other poets the power of style seems to have 
exercised an inspiring and intoxicating effect," 
he does not in the least intend to imply " a cer- 
tain absence of due self-restraint." Else how 
could he have taken Pindar for a type of the 
grand style in simplicity ? And what can a 



110

[Feb. 16, 



writer who uses words with Professor Jebb's 
habitual precision mean by the affirmation that 
the style of ^Eschylus is always the grand style ? 
The style of ^Eschylus is, in passages, as vicious 
as Shakespeare's : 

" Till that Bellona's bridegroom lapped in proof 
Confronted him with self-comparisons." 

Professor Jebb should leave it to the critics 
who think Arnold was " running down " Shake- 
speare to confound grand style and great poet. 

The most noteworthy thing in the chapters 
on the Drama is the acute and sensible sum- 
ming up of the controversy as to the merits of 
Euripides. It would perhaps have been more 
amusing if Professor Jebb had " taken sides," 
and either rehabilitated Euripides with Brown- 
ing and Mr. Mahaffy, or denounced his plays 
as " shapeless abortions " with Mr. Swinburne. 
Instead of this, he shows us, by an admirable 
critical analysis, just why Euripides, though 
he failed as an Hellenic artist, became the ideal 
poet of the Hellenistic world, and appeals with 
a legitimate attraction to the troubled romantic 
modern spirit. He is a "fascinating poet," 
the author of a " dazzling compromise," and the 
" peculiar gift which his genius has bequeathed 
to the modern world " shows a " blending of 
Hellenic light, though its light is declining, with 
the incipient promise of Eomance." In spite 
of this scrupulous judicial fairness, it is easy 
to feel that Professor Jebb is too good a Greek 
not to prefer for himself the pure "Hellenic 
light." His private and intimate feeling would, 
if I mistake riot, be that of Professor Jowett, 
recently communicated by Mr. Swinburne in 
his " Recollections ": " I have been reading 
Euripides lately, and still retain my old bad 
opinion of him sophist, sentimentalist, sensa- 
tionalist no Greek in the better sense of the 
term." Professor Jebb is too urbane to disa- 
ble the judgment of Euripides' admirers, but 
it is not difficult to apprehend his real meaning 
when he writes : " The degree in which a mod- 
ern enjoys Sophocles is not necessarily a meas- 
ure of his feeling for poetry ; but it may fairly 
be taken as a measure of his sympathy with 
the finest qualities of the Athenian genius." 

In conclusion, I wish to call attention to one 
distinctive excellence which this interesting lit- 
tle volume possesses in common with all the 
work of its author. It will not mislead the 
English reader. Greek literature is coming to 
be studied more and more in translations, ex- 
positions, compendiums. There is no lack of 
such aids, and they are multiplying every day. 
But it is not easy to find books that may safely 



be recommended to serious students who desire 
truth and just opinions as well as entertainment 
and mild titillation of the intellectual palate. 
Even when gross inaccuracies as regards ex- 
ternal fact are avoided, there is apt to be some- 
thing limited, arbitrary, fantastic, exaggerated, 
or wilfully perverse, in the expositions of Greek 
life and thought written for the general reader. 
The picture is slightly out of drawing, the ob- 
jects are out of focus, the values are not rightly 
given, and there is a haze of false sentiment 
over all. It is not the least of the many merits 
of Professor Jebb's work that it is free from 
these defects. And the English reader may 
almost employ it as a touchstone by which to 
test his other helps. p AUL SHOREY> 



ARCHITECTURE, PAST AXD FUTURE. * 

A very interesting field of study might be 
found in the principles, if there be any, that 
should govern the naming of books, or per- 
haps the variations of fashion in book-naming. 
If Mr. Van Brunt's book entitled " Greek 
Lines " had been published a century ago, it 
would probably have been called " An Inquiry 
into the Present State of Architecture, espe- 
cially in the United States ; with some Observ- 
ations upon the Nature of the Architectural 
Art and its Connection with Poetry." Such, 
at any rate, are the subjects chiefly considered 
in his book, which takes its name from the title 
of the first essay. 

" Greek Lines " is a collection of studies on 
architectural subjects ; but not merely a gath- 
ering together of separate papers, for the au- 
thor has collated the essays so as " to form a 
sequence in which from first to last there should 
be evident a more or less orderly development." 
Being, then, the presentation, in a somewhat 
systematic form, of opinions concerning the 
present state of architecture and of principles 
concerning architecture in general, by one of 
the eminent practical architects of the day, the 
book certainly commands attention ; and it 
must at once be said that it well repays any- 
one who is interested in the matter, for it is 
original and scholarly and refined. 

The present state of architecture is a very 

interesting subject. On the one hand, we have 

jeremiads on the part of such as point out that 

we have nowadays no distinctive style ; on the 

i other just at present, at least we have

the joyful paeans occasioned by the successful 
beauty of the World's Fair buildings. We see 
every day much that is distressing, and in our 
mind's eye we look forward on future beauties 
flushing in the glow of hope. Meanwhile we 
have an enormous amount of building, espe- 
cially in the West ; a number of young gentle- 
men in Paris learning how it should be done ; 
and too many other people engaged in doing it. 

Mr. Van Brunt is by no means discouraging. 
His book is in sjood part an exposition of the 
motto, " Good Architecture, but not a Style." 
The motto is perhaps daring, and yet it seems 
as though something of the sort were necessary, 
when we think of the Gothic revival, the Queen 
Anne revival, even of the Richardsonian Ro- 
manesque. Good Architecture, of course ; but 
why not also a Style ? Why not an American 
style (to go, let us say, with our American 
school in music, painting, literature), or a 
Western style, or even a World's Fair style ? 
Well, for one thing (I believe I am practically 
quoting Mr. Van Brunt), because to have a 
style we must have a national feeling, an artis- 
tic tradition, and a comparative ignorance of 
other styles. And even if the first two of these 
possessions were ours, the last is practically im- 
possible. 

But if we are not to have a style, what then ? 
Mr. Van Brunt's answer to this question is, to 
-a layman at least, exceedingly instructive, both 
as to what a style is and as to what American 
architecture can achieve. In his different Es- 
says he treats the question in various ways ; he 
shows the value of an appreciation of the spirit 
of Greek art, he points out the value of con- 
science in modern architecture, he insists on 
the possibility of in some way manipulating the 
cumbersome knowledge of the present day into 
work that will be good. His treatment through- 
out is on a high plane, and one gets ideas even 
when disagreeing. 

In his more general views on architecture, 
Mr. Van Brunt propounds many opinions which 
it would be a pleasure to debate with him. 
The notion of Aphrodite, or the personification 
of the great creative principle " as lying at the 
root of all high art," for instance, or the view 
of architecture as the most human of the arts, 
these and other views, did only time and 
space permit, would in discussion lead to beau- 
tiful and interesting variations. To one mat- 
ter Mr. Van Brunt has devoted more than a 
passing notice ; namely, the analogy between 
Architecture and Poetry. The analogy be- 
tween the arts has given rise to various pleasant 



fallacies nowadays. Why cannot " the emotions 
awakened in the mind of an intelligent expert 
by the contemplation of a work of pure archi- 
tecture " be awakened, at least in some degree, 
in other minds by poetry ? Mr. Van Brunt can- 
not see why such a thing should not be natural ; 
he comments upon architecture in the poets, 
and finally offers an experiment of his own. 
" The Church Door : a Study in Romanesque," 
is a sweet and pleasing poem, and it would be 
somewhat ungracious to take it as offered in 
proof of the point. I incline to compare it with 
Sir Edwin Arnold's Introduction to " With 
Sa'di in the Garden." But that effort to pre- 
sent the impression of the Taj Mahal was by 
no means the most poetical part of the book ; 
and its two most poetical passages were two 
that had hardly any reference to architecture.

SOME RECENT BOOKS OF TRAVEL,.* 

Mr. Frederick Diodati Thompson has given to 
the world, in his " In the Track of the Sun," the 
most sumptuous itinerary of travel ever placed be- 
fore the American public. Gorgeously bound in 
the colors of the Orient, in scarlet, green, and gold, 
perfect in typography, exquisite in illustration, the 
book is a delight to the eye. The first thought in 
reading it is that, since Mr. Thompson has told his 
story so well, we wish he ha,d spent a much longer 
time in each place ; for nowhere did " the dust grow 
old upon his sandal-shoon." He was but seven 
months in making the entire trip round the world. 
But we have Biblical authority for the assertion that 
he who runs may read. When we note Mr. Thomp- 
son's cheerfulness, his fresh interest in everything, 
we recall Byron's lines in " Don Juan ": 
" There is nothing gives a man such spirits, 

Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry, 
As going at full speed no matter where its 

Direction he, so 'tis but in a hurry."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Everything seemed to come to this globe-trotter, 
just as he went to everything ; he had a perfect 
genius for travelling. Earthquakes did not over- 
look him, nor did he omit being tattooed. He must 
have been exceptionally vigorous in health and alert 
of eye to have accomplished so much ; but it all 
would have been as naught, he would have been but 
one of Lord Bacon's "land-lopers,"had he not also 
such a simple, unaffected, but thoroughly well-poised 
literary style of telling what he saw, and telling it 
with point and humor. His good taste is also shown 
in the illustrations chosen for his volume, which are 
extremely beautiful, and many of them novel, even 
to the eye of a traveller. We might especially note 
the views in Japan and India. For its illustra- 
tions alone the book would be eagerly welcomed as 
offering a method of exhibition of foreign pictures 
much more convenient than the ordinary burden- 
some and expensive collection of photographs gath- 
ered in travel. 

Mr. Thompson says very frankly : " Almost every 
writer seems to have his own method of spelling not 
only the Hindoo names, but also other words not 
entirely relating to India, which is exasperatingly 
confusing." This may account for some unusual 
spellings in the book Knas for Khas, Ledia for 
Sedia, and Munataz for Mumtaz ; or these may be 
simply errors in printing. One is impressed with 
Mr. Thompson's care in relating his wondrous tales, 
his evident intention to give as facts solely what 
that seventeenth century traveller James Howell 
called his " owne Optique obseruations." We have 
the full confidence, too, that the author saw more than 
he told, but remembered and exemplified Schiller's 
line, "The artist may be known by what he omits." 

But one regret arises in reading the book : it 
emphasizes the fact that we have now found the 
day of Seneca's prediction there is no longer any 
"Ultima Thule." 

A few of the beautiful head and tail pieces through- 
out the volume are accompanied with no significant 
description, notably that of a very good-looking 
man in a fez, who makes his bow on the last page 
of the book. Of his personality, we can, to use Sir 
Thomas Browne's phrase, hazard a wide solution : 
he might be Captain Parsell, whose name occurs on 
that same page ; or Abdul-Hamid II., to whom the 
volume is dedicated. But we hope it is the " coun- 
terfeit presentment " of the author, the alert, clear- 
eyed traveller, to whom we say, as did an admirer 
to another traveller, Captain John Smith of Vir- 
ginia, centuries ago : 

" Thou to passe the worldes foure parts dost deeme 
No more than 'twere to goe to bed or dreame." 

Some portions of Mr. Richard Harding Davis's 
wanderings near the Mediterranean followed in 
the steps of Mr. Thompson ; but Mr. Davis's de- 
scriptions, in " The Rulers of the Mediterranean," 
are much fuller, he tells much more of surround- 
ing circumstances and of his own impressions, and 
with that ease and finish that comes from art, not 
chance. His chapters relate to " The Rock of Gib- 



raltar," " Tangier," " From Gibraltar to Cairo," 
" Cairo as a Show Place," " The English in Egypt," 
"Modern Athens," and "Constantinople." The 
one on " The English in Egypt " is a thoughtful, a 
powerful exposition of the condition of the govern- 
ment of Egypt to-day, wonderfully concise and 
pointed in expression, yet perfectly and interest- 
ingly explanatory ; it is a chapter to set one think- 
ing. The account of Modern Athens is appropri- 
ate ; the style is suited to the theme. The book is 
well illustrated. 

The steamer that bore Mr. Davis to Gibraltar 
carried another traveller, a far older one, who had 
visited the Mediterranean shores four times before, 
and who was to write a book called "The Barbary 
Coast," the Rev. Dr. Henry M. Field, the editor 
of " The Evangelist." It affords much amusement 
to read Dr. Field's chapters on Gibraltar, Tangier, 
etc., after reading Mr. Davis's. I am bound to say 
that on the whole the two travellers agree very well 
in their stories ; nor can I wholly decide which 
gives the better account. I will follow the exam- 
ple of the ambassador of France when asked by Queen 
Elizabeth which danced the better, the Queen of 
Scots or herself. He answered, " The Queen of Scots 
doth indeed dance most gracefully, but your Maj- 
esty dances more high and disposedly." Mr. Davis 
wields certainly a most graceful pen, but the cler- 
gyman writes " more high and disposedly," he tells 
more details of the various subjects. For instance, 
in his chapter on Gibraltar he devotes eight pages 
to the history of the Black Watch becoming, in- 
deed, somewhat discursive thereon. 

Howell, in his book on "forreine travail," tells 
of purblind travellers, whom he compares to Jonah, 
who travelled much and saw little. Dr. Field is 
none of these ; he saw everything, and with clear 
and discriminating eye. " The common man," says 
Richter, "is copious in Narrative, and exiguous in 
Reflection ; only with the cultivated man is it re- 
verse-wise." It may be said of Dr. Field that he 
is copious both in narrative and reflection. He has 
an almost perfect narrative style ; he is a most dis- 
passionate observer of mankind ; he has wonderful 
depth of penetration into the character of men of 
various nationalities, and much facility in the ex- 
pression of his observations. His chapter on " Lights 
and Shadows of African Life " is a profound study ; 
and that on " How the Islams Fast and Pray " is a 
most sympathetic one. A single sentence of Dr. 
Field's shows his character and the spirit of his 
book : " I never condemn a man without afterward 
trying to clear him from my own condemnation." 

The illustrations in Dr. Field's book are very 
fine ; some of them are very remarkable. There is an 
absplutely unique and deeply interesting portrait of 
the Sultan of Morocco, showing a noble countenance 
full of the melancholy so characteristic of the Ori- 
entals. A scene in the street of Algiers, a view of 
an Arab school, one of the lighthouse at Cape Spar- 
tel, one entitled " An African pet," are particularly 
striking.

Books on Northern Africa abound and are widely 
read, but Father Ohrwalder's " Ten Years' Captiv- 
ity in the Mahdi's Camp " will scarcely find the cir- 
culation in America that it has had in England, 
where it has been through nine editions within a 
year. Ninety pages have been struck out for the 
American public, for which we are very grateful, 
for there is enough of the book as it now stands to 
satisfy each and every reader, no matter what he 
seeks. But there is much that is interesting in it ; 
many pages also that are dull ; still more that are re- 
volting ; many that are pathetic ; some that are 
incomprehensible and bewildering. No Arabian 
Nights tale ever was more romantic, apparently 
more impossible, than this story of the life of El 
Mahdi. No martyr of old suffered more or longer 
than did these Romish missionaries and sisters dur- 
ing those years of captivity ; and so long as Gordon 
and Hicks still live in the hearts of their fellow- 
countrymen, or rather of the entire world outside 
of the Soudan, as emblems of patriotic heroes and 
martyrs, so long will such books as this be of liv- 
ing though gruesome interest. But the book is not 
" pretty reading," nor soothing to the nerves, nor 
has it any alluring literary qualities ; and for my- 
self I shall rejoice in what Carlyle calls " the tri- 
umph of the Decency-principle," when such blood- 
curdling details are not given to the reading public. 

To one who in days of his youth has pored en- 
chanted through many an hour of dim twilight and 
firelight over what a friend designated as the " mlion 
mpalm mtesai massegai-filled pages " of Bruce, 
Baker, and Burton, of Speke and Livingstone, and 
of other more or less tergiversating African explor- 
ers, who has in later days greeted with delight 
even Rider Haggard's fairy tales of the Dark Con- 
tinent, the volume of " Adventures in Mashona- 
land " is as welcome as fresh news from an old 
friend ; and it has also an additional zest of novelty 
in that the news has an unusual and somewhat fem- 
inine cast, albeit a professional one the view taken 
by a trained hospital nurse. The book is written 
in a vigorous, hearty style, with much plainness of 
speech, though never flippant, and with no flowers 
of rhetoric, though thoroughly graphic. The authors 
are, on the whole, not very complimentary to the 
African clergy. They found the Bishop "young, 
pleasant, persuasive, with an exceptional talent 
for getting out of the room well. He evanesced 
rather than left, and left behind him a little hush." 
This talent for getting away was displayed by the 
Bishop on other occasions, in leaving the sisters 
in a most critical point on the road ; and in promptly, 
on the day of the death of their first patient, leav- 
ing Mashonaland, and then Africa altogether, and 
going to England to collect money. He seems to 
have had a fine apostolic presence, with but little 
else. Of a rowdy ball at Johannesburg, their first 
African home, they write : 

" A Church of England clergyman played the fiddle 
in the orchestra. He was attired in the usual swallow- 
tail, and wore tight black knee-breeches, silk stockings, 



shoes and buckles. The next day his ungrateful flock 
commented in the papers on the thinness of his legs." 

The Manica pastor they depict thus : 

" He wore a helmet, a flannel shirt, and coarse blue 
trousers much too short, of the type dear to navvies. 
These were held in place by a large, scarlet handker- 
chief, which, however, did its work so indifferently that 
Mr. Sewall was always hitching up his trousers like a 
comic sailor in a pantomime. I may state here that the 
following Easter Mr. Sewall, to use his own expression, 
' chucked his orders ' and went into partnership with a 
Jew tavern-keeper." 

Sociological observations were little noted by 
these nurses. Living for two years in a land where 
polygamy and polyandry were practised, and hav- 
ing unusual opportunities of insight into the effect 
of those institutions on the lives of native women 
of all stations, from the queen to her slaves, they 
might have contributed much to our knowledge of 
primitive marriage customs ; yet the pages are bar- 
ren of these facts. Perhaps they felt as did another 
woman traveller, two centuries ago, that such things 
were not " Proper to be Related by a Female pen." 

Contrary to the reports of many travellers in 
Mashonaland (Mr. Bent being one), but confirming 
the stories of Mr. Selous, these nurses found plenty 
of lions and wild beasts. At one point of the jour- 
ney they write : 

"The lions, coming down to drink at the swampy- 
pool just in front of the huts, made such a terrific 
noise that the earth seemed to shake with their roar- 
ing. It was a strange sensation to find ourselves so 
near all these wild creatures, with not even the slender- 
est door or mat to shut them out of our hut." 

Lions were bold enough to make inroads into 
Umatili, the town, where two were killed, " one in 
High Street and one near the oven of our friend 
the baker," and their spoor was found everywhere. 
The authors tell of the death of many natives through 
lions ; one horrible story of an attack and siege of 
two Englishmen in their remote hut, and the piti- 
ful death of one Mr. Teal. When the nurses them- 
selves were lying seriously ill with a fever, a great 
leopard tried to spring in through the upper half 
of the door, which was open to admit air. 
Of their meeting with Mr. Selous, we read : 
"We were much afraid we should miss Mr. Selous, 
but he sent us word that he would come as soon as he 
could get his shirt washed. When we received this 
message we felt sure he was a delightful person; and 
our instincts did not deceive us. Mr. Selous appeared 
to be a man about eight and thirty, light, active, and 
giving one an impresssion of presence of mind and re- 
source. Of his personal appearance it is impossible to 
remember anything but his eyes, which are extraordi- 
narily clear and limpid. He is known throughout Africa 
as the man who never tells a lie. What a splendid re- 
putation to have anywhere, but especially in Africa ! 
He told us he had shot twenty-three lions with his own 
gun, and helped to put an end to nine others. He said 
our mode of travelling, sleeping about in the open beside 
dim fires, was extremely foolhardy, and we should pro- 
bably have suffered for it had not the country been so 
well stocked with game."

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



The chief nursing done by these two heroines 
was in cases of fever ; and we cannot wonder that 
fevers were so violent and fatal in Mashonaland 
when we read of the climate, and of the vast amount 
of bad whiskey that is consumed there. The book 
shows, without ostentation or demand for sympathy 
or laudation, the noble life of self-sacrifice led for 
two years by these devoted Englishwomen among 
most unwonted and even repulsive surroundings; 
and proves that women will cheerfully endure, for 
love of God and their fellow-men, many privations 
that men will shrink from, even though lured on 
by the all-powerful love of gold. 

The jesting and vivacious account of a visit to 
Corsica, " A Wild Sheep Chase," sparkles with that 
ironical French gaiety first made known to us in 
the writings of Rabelais, and since familar to us 
almost too familiar in the more or less successful 
imitations and variations seen in the works of many 
successive French authors. Though the hero of this 
tale chases, of course he never catches, or even sees, 
the wild sheep, the mouflon ; but the recounting of 
the elusions and illusions of the chase affords him a 
felicitous opportunity to display for our amusement 
and edification many clever anecdotes and vivid 
descriptions, and much half-serious information ; to 
give, indeed, as a whole, a most spirited picture of 
life in Corsica a life which exhibits a simplicity 
that will inevitably be soon altered, as there is now 
a railroad across the island. Doubtless in the Na- 
poleonic renaissance of the day. this account of the 
birthplace of Napoleon will be much read. The 
laughing by-play of wit suffers in the translation, 
as does nearly all humorous writing when rendered 
into another language than its native one. Some- 
how the laughter, even in the original, seems a lit- 
tle forced, and the eccentricities of style somewhat 
monotonous. Pages peppered with exclamation 
marks and interrogation points abound to satiety ; 
and, altogether, we close the book feeling we are 
not as amused as we ought to be. 

It is a long way from Africa to the Arctic seas, 
but the same glamour of novelty, of strangeness, 
hangs around both lands. " My Arctic Journal," 
the interesting book of Mrs. Peary's life in the 
Arctic regions, written only after much persuasion, 
opens with a tender and manly preface from her 
husband, Lieutenant Robert E. Peary, and ends with 
an account written by him of " The Great White 
Journey." Though her publishers announce that 
the fair traveller has made a valuable contribution 
to ethnological learning, I think the book is in some 
points of ethnological study somewhat disappoint- 
ing; notably so in information about the women 
of the isolated Eskimo tribe among whom she re- 
sided. A year's residence among them should have 
given her a close insight into their lives ; but she 
seems (and who could blame her?) to have care- 
fully avoided seeing too much of the "huskies." 
Some of her information is curious, and all that she 
gives is interesting. She writes : 



" The native method of treating the skins of all ani- 
mals intended for clothing is first to rid them of as 
much of the fat as can be got off by scraping with a 
knife; then they are stretched as tight as possible and 
allowed to become perfectly dry. After this they are 
taken by the women and chewed and sucked all over 
in order to get as much of the grease out as possible; 
then they are again dried and scraped with a dull in- 
strument so as to break the fibres. Chewing the skins 
is very hard on the women, and all of it is done by them; 
they cannot chew more than two deerskins per day, and 
are obliged to rest their jaws every other day." 

She tells of hiring a chewer for one seamstress too 
old to chew for herself. The work is held by the 
seamstress with her feet and legs. The thread is 
made by splitting narwhal sinews moistened in the 
mouth. Mrs. Peary does not describe the thimbles 
used. I know nothing in the book more fairly pa- 
thetic than her description of what she endured 
through the odor emanating from these seamstresses 
who must indeed "smell to heaven " and her 
invariable and necessary cleansing of person and 
room with alcohol and corrosive sublimate, to be rid 
of the parasites shed by the dirty chewers. The 
Chicagoized Esquimo wives and their villainous 
children make one fully believe Mrs. Peary's tale. 
The book is illustrated from interesting photo- 
graphs taken by the Pearys. Some of the prints 
are half -tinted, and prove very satisfactory in effect ; 
the one entitled "The Sunset Glow" is especially 
beautiful with its opalescent tints. The chief thought 
that rises upon reading this book is whether, after 
all, Mrs. Peary's experience was " worth the while." 
When the courageous explorer visited one Innuit 
igloo, she was met by a very aged and oily Eskimo 
woman, who scrutinized her closely, and then said 
slowly, " I have lived a great many suns, but I have 
never seen anything like you." May we live a great 
many suns ere we see any other woman like her 
ere we see any refined, intelligent, gently nurtured 
woman going unnecessarily upon any exploring ex- 
pedition, in peril of her health, her comfort, her 
life ; and at the additional peril of being a hind- 
rance, in emergencies, to the success of the explor- 
ing party. And yet, what the hospital nurses did in 
Africa for love of Man, 'Mrs. Peary did in Greenland 
also for love of man for love of her husband !

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Prof. Romanes* Professor Romanes has, perhaps 
Studies in Organic more than any other writer in this 
Evolution. country or in England, interested 

himself in the critical examination of publications 
relating to the subject of organic evolution. He has 
written voluminously on all its phases, and is a 
sort of guardian of the faith, examining and pro- 
nouncing on all heresies and schisms. For this 
function he is eminently fitted by his intimate per- 
sonal acquaintance with Darwin's modes of thought, 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



115 



as well as by his wide acquaintance with the liter- 
ature of the subject and by his experimental knowl- 
edge in certain lines. In " An Examination of 
Weismannism " (The Open Court Publishing Co.) 
he has attempted only an examination seriatim of 
Professor Weismann's essays on this subject since 
1886, including his latest theory of Amphimixis. 
The work is a keen scrutiny of all the positions 
taken by the Freiburg Professor, and a testing of 
these in the light of facts. In a general way we 
may say that Professor Romanes finds it impossible 
to assent to the doctrine of the continuity of germ- 
plasm, and appears to be inclined to advocate in its 
stead Gallon's idea of " Stirp," a continuous but 
open succession, which does not exclude from time 
to time new accessions capable of being grafted 
upon the ancestral stock, though due to the direct 
action of the environment of the structure of the 
parent. Though the present work is not an attempt 
to defend any thesis on the subject, but, rather, 
merely an examination of the structure reared by 
another, there is no lack of glimpses of the Dar- 
winian notion of " gemmules," and some defences 
of the same against the entirely opposite doctrine 
of germ-plasm continuity. Of this doctrine our 
author says : " Beautiful though it may be in its 
imposing elevation, this drawing of the architecture 
of the germ-plasm must be regarded as a work of 
the artistic imagination rather than as one of sci- 
entific generalization." This position will strike the 
reader of "The Germ-Plasm " as hardly fair, since 
the latter work, though highly speculative in its char- 
acter and in some respects doubtless in error, is never- 
theless as genuine an attempt to interpret the hidden 
facts of nature from the patent ones as are many 
of the notions passing current in biology and other 
sciences. Though Professor Weismann shall be 
proved to be wrong in regard to the absolute sta- 
bility and perfect continuity of the germ, this will 
not compel the rejection of his notion of the nuclear 
structure. The central idea of this theory is the 
definite structure of the nucleus, whereby it is able 
to sort and distribute structural units whose devel- 
opment will produce a new organism. This notion, 
according to Professor Romanes, is not proven. 
The further position of Professor Weismann is that 
the nuclear material has been derived from an ovum 
of the preceding generation which before its own 
development set this aside as the nuclear material 
of the succeeding generation. On this conception 
of the structure and history of the nucleus, heredity 
is the result of the continuity of nuclear material, 
or, as Professor Weismann calls it, " germ-plasm." 
Darwin's idea of the history of the ovum was en- 
tirely different. He supposed that all the cells of 
an adult animal or plant throw off minute particles 
called by him " gemmules," some of which are at- 
tracted together from all cells to constitute the 
ovum, so that this is a sort of epitome of the body 
to be developed. This, Professor Weismann also 
supposes ; but he views the egg-cell nucleus, not as 
a new formation in each generation, but as one car- 



ried along continuously from a generation to the 
next. The final structure, by whichever route at- 
tained, may be much as Professor Weismann has 
formulated it. Professor Romanes, however, does 
not admit this. But his main contention is upon 
the absolute stability of the germ-plasm, which no- 
tion he considers incompatible with the facts of both 
heredity and evolution. If the germ-plasm, though 
very stable, be still capable of alteration through 
the effects of influences, coming directly to it from 
the organism, such as gemmules thrown off from 
various parts, then we should have the substance of 
Galton's theory of " Stirp." This latter seems more 
probable ; and Professor Weismann seems to be 
drifting in this direction, without, Professor Ro- 
manes contends, sufficiently acknowledging the pri- 
ority of the theory of Galton. In this work Pro- 
fessor Romanes does not appear sufficiently to ap- 
preciate the value of Professor Weismann's efforts 
to arrive at a notion of the real structure of the 
nucleus ; but he does point out truly the limitations 
of the germ-plasm theory as held by Professor Weis- 
mann in the domain of Evolution. 



Tennysonian 
Studies and 
Criticisms. 



"Tennyson, Poet, Philosopher, Ideal- 
ist," by Mr. J. Cuming Walters (im- 
ported by Scribner), is the work of an 
enthusiast, generally in full sympathy with his sub- 
ject, not exaggerated in its estimates, but possessed 
of slight critical, as distinguished from expository, 
value. Although it does not claim to be a biog- 
raphy of Tennyson, it nearly amounts to that, for 
the history of the poet's works is really the history 
of his life. A few features of the book are the 
fine engraved portrait (from one of Mrs. Cameron's 
photographs), the chapter on Tennyson's literary 
characteristics, the study of his suppressed and re- 
vised poems, the note on Tennysonian volumes and 
manuscripts, and the careful chronology. The book 
is also noticeable for the anecdotes which it gathers 
from out-of-the-way sources, and for its numerous 
selected passages from the earlier criticism made 
upon the poems. But why, in this connection, the 
author should have done Hain Friswell the honor 
of quotation, as he does upon three or four occa- 
sions, passes comprehension. If ever man wrote 
himself most unmistakably an ass, it was this same 
Hain Friswell when he set forth the reasons why 
Tennyson should not, in his estimation, be held a 
great poet. Mr. Walters has gleaned an occasional 
new fact, as when he discovered that Thomas Sun- 
derland of Trinity was the subject of "A Character," 
and has made an occasional mistake, as when he 
states that Mr. Frederick Tennyson wrote but one 
of the " Poems by Two Brothers." At least four of 
them are acknowledged by him. Like many of 
Tennyson's otherwise intelligent critics, Mr. Walters 
joins in the, cry against the dramas. He calls 
" Queen Mary " " incomparably ponderous and 
dull," "The Falcon" "unmeet for serious criti- 
cism," and makes other no less inapt observations. 
But he subsequently bestows so much praise upon

the dramas taken in detail that these preliminary 
depreciations lose most of their effect. He pretends 
to praise these details without heing " antilogous," 
but this we cannot admit. And it is difficult to un- 
derstand how any true Tennysonian could have said 
that the twenty-three poems of the posthumous vol- 
ume would not have made any poet's fame. To our 
mind, almost any single poem of that volume would 
have won fame for its author had he heen hitherto 
absolutely unknown. To recur to the plays once 
more, the question of their fitness for the stage has 
never been fairly tested. " Queen Mary " has been 
highly successful in Australia ; " Becket" and "The 
Foresters" in both England and America. The 
fact that "The Cup" and "The Falcon" and "The 
Promise of May " have been rejected by the pub- 
lic simply shows that they failed to find their proper 
audience when the first attempt was made. We 
may say, in conclusion, that, although a better book 
planned upon the same lines might be easily con- 
ceived of, the book that Mr. Walters has made is 
one that the student of English poetry can hardly 
go without. 

The saying " better late than never " 
is well verified in " Seventy Years of 
Irish Life " (Macmillan), a racy col- 
lection of Hiberniana by Mr. W. R. Le Fanu, who 
now makes his literary debut at the age of seventy- 
eight. The author, a brother of J. Sheridan Le 
Fanu, sketches with a light and rapid hand various 
phases of life in Erin, fairs, wakes, factions, duels, 
and what not, the whole agreeably enlivened by the 
sparkle of the national wit and the whack of the 
national blackthorn. Touching that popular Hiber- 
nian social " function " the faction fight, Mr. Le 
Fanu declares that the story that the row begins 
" by one man taking off his coat and trailing it behind 
him, saying i who dare tread on that ? ' is a myth. 
I have seen many a faction fight, every one of which 
began in the same way, which was thus : one man 
' wheeled,' as they called it, for his party ; that is, 
he marched up and down, flourishing his black- 
thorn, and shouting the battle-cry of his faction, 
' Here is Coffey aboo against Reaskawallahs ; here 
is Coffey aboo who dar strike a Coffey ? ' 'I 
dar,' shouted one of the other party; 'here's Reas- 
kawallah aboo,' at the same instant making a whack 
with his shillelagh at his opponent's head. In an 
instant hundreds of sticks were up, hundreds of 
heads were broken," etc. Once, just after one of 
these little affairs, the author saw " an elderly man 
running after a young fellow of two or three and 
twenty, every time he got near striking him on the 
head with a heavy blackthorn, and at every blow 
setting the blood streaming from his head. ' Why,' 
said I, ' does that young fellow let the old man beat 
him in that savage way ? ' ' Ah, sure, your honor,' 
said he, ' that's only his father that's chastisin' him 
for fighting.' " Here is a good story of a witty 
priest no rara avis, by the way, in the Green 
Isle : " A farmer once asked the well-known Father 



Tom Maguire what a miracle was. He gave him 
a very full explanation, which, however, did not 
seem to satisfy the farmer, who said ' Now do you 
think, your raverence, you could give me an exam- 
ple of miracles ? ' ' Well,' said Father Tom, ' walk 
on before me, and I'll see what I can do.' As he 
did so he gave him a tremendous kick behind. ' Did 
you feel that ? ' he asked. ' Why wouldn't I feel 
it ? ' said the farmer, rubbing the damaged place, 
'Begorra, I did feel it, sure enough.' 'Well,' said 
Father Tom, ' it would have been a miracle if you 
didn't.' " This demonstration a posteriori seems to 
have proved sufficient. Mr. Le Fanu's book will 
help to while away an evening or two very pleas- 
antly. 

Two more volumes of the " Collected 

Collected Essays of f p rofessor Huxley have 

Professor Huxley. . . v 7 i_vi J/A i ^ \ r\ 

just been published ( Appleton). One 
of them, " Darwiniana," reproduces the lectures and 
essays written in defense of " The Origin of Spe- 
cies," beginning with an essay which dates from the 
very year (1859) of that epoch-making work, and 
ending with an obituary notice written in 1888 for 
the Proceedings of the Royal Society. This is now 
all ancient history, yet not undeserving of preserva- 
tion. Professor Huxley did yeoman service for the 
cause of natural selection, and bore, more than any 
other one man in England (except the Great Dis- 
coverer himself), the brunt of the battle. And he 
must, in collecting these essays for republication, 
look back with peculiar satisfaction to his share in 
forcing the general public to its acceptance of the 
essential Darwinian doctrines. The volume is 
pieced out by a series of six lectures to working- 
men " On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phe- 
nomena of Organic Nature." The lectures date 
from 1863, but many audiences might still profit 
by them. " I am not without some grounds for 
suspecting," says the author, " that there yet re- 
mains a fair sprinkling even of ' philosophic think- 
ers ' to whom it may be a profitable, perhaps even 
a novel, task to descend from the- heights of spec- 
ulation and go over the A B C of the great biolog- 
ical problem as it was set before a body of shrewd 
artisans at that remote epoch." In " Science and 
Education," the other volume now published, we 
have no less than seventeen pieces, most of them 
relating to the place of science in educational 
schemes. The author appears in a less favorable 
light than usual in this volume, for the zeal with 
which he champions science leads him to say some 
very indiscreet things about the humanities. We 
are all glad that, thanks largely to Professor Hux- 
ley's efforts, science has obtained ample recognition 
in the school and the college, but the exaggerated 
claims made by him (and by Mr. Spencer) in its 
behalf at a time when it was struggling for recog- 
nition will not bear the test of sober examination. 
Even the Darwinian polemic has more of permanent 
value than this collection of addresses, however use- 
ful they may have been in their time.

THE DIAL

Literary 
anecdotes and 
reminiscences. 



A readable and commendably con- 
cise volume of literary and other 
reminiscences is Camilla Crosland's 
"Landmarks of a Literary Life 1820-1892 " 
(Scribner ). Mrs. Crosland's pages are well studded 
with eminent names Edmund Kean, Malibran, 
Thomas Moore, Jenny Lind, Leigh Hunt, the Brown- 
ings, the Howitts, Charlotte Cushman, Margaret 
Fuller, etc. and her stories are mostly fresh and 
crisply told. She met Hawthorne in 1854, and gives 
the following impressions of him : " In society he 
was one of the most painfully shy men I ever knew. 
I never had the pleasure of an unbroken tete-h-tete 
with him, and am under the impression that with a 
single listener he must have been a very interesting 
talker ; but in the small social circle in which I first 
met him it really seemed impossible to draw him 
out. We were only five or six intimate friends, sit- 
ting round the fire, and with a host remarkable for 
his geniality and tact ; but Hawthorne fidgeted on 
the sofa, seemed really to have little to say, and 
almost resented the homage that was paid him." 
Not so reticent was Mrs. Stowe, who " did not ignore 
the fact that she had done an important piece of 
work in the world, but showed neither mock humil- 
ity nor self-laudation on the subject." Notwith- 
standing "the strong Yankee twang of her dialect," 
thinks Mrs. Crosland, " there was a very charming 
simplicity about Mrs. Stowe." Here is an amusing 
story of her : " She was being entertained at one 
of the ducal residences, and the occasion was a large 
dinner-party. In a momentary lull of conversation, 
Mrs. Stowe, who had been gazing somewhat earnestly 
at her hostess, exclaimed in a voice that everyone 
could hear ' Duchess, however do you fix your 
hair ? ' ' You must ask Louise,' replied the Duchess 
of Sutherland, with a smile that in no way betrayed 
astonishment or rebuked her guest." Apropos of 
this British analogue of the episode of Ajax and 
the lightning, Mrs. Crosland is good enough to add, 
" In glancing at the eccentricity of manners of a 
past generation of Americans, it is only fair to ac- 
knowledge how vastly they have impi'oved of late 
years" largely, it seems, through much contem- 
plation of John Bull, the Chesterfield and the " Tur- 
veydrop " of national types, whose urbanity and un- 
failing tact are a byword among nations. 

Old English and That . ^ historical study of English 
Middle English is gaining ground in this country is 
in one handbook. attes t e d by the large number of Old 
English text-books that have appeared in America 
in recent years. Prominent among these are Pro- 
fessor Cook's translation of Professor Eduard Sie- 
vers's "Grammar of Old English" and Dr. Bright's 
41 Anglo-Saxon Reader." The latest American pub- 
lication in the department of English philology is 
Professor MacLean's " Old and Middle English 
Header" (Macmillan), which deserves to be ranked 
with the best of its kind. The book " is primarily 
&n attempt to provide for the learner in Old and 
Middle English helps similar to those which have 



been furnished in the best Greek and Latin text- 
books." " It is based on Professor Zupitza's Alt- 
und Mittelenglisches Ubungsbuch zum Gebrauche 
bei Universitdts- Vorlesungen" and " like its orig- 
inal, it is emphatically an Exercise Book. Like 
that, it is concise and comprehensive. Unlike its 
original, in order to meet the requirements of En- 
glish-speaking teachers and pupils, it is supplied 
with illustrative etymologies, cognate words, phon- 
ological equations, necessary historical and literary 
introductions, and bibliographical references." The 
Introduction gives information as to the Old and 
Middle English dialects, and contains a special in- 
troduction to each of the selections, with much val- 
uable bibliographical detail, and critical notes on 
the text. A chapter on Versification, from the pen 
of Mr. O. L. Triggs, M.A., of the University of Chi- 
cago, gives, in concise and clear form, the most nec- 
essary information on this important subject. The 
Selections are thirty-four in number, fifteen illus- 
trating Old English, and the rest Middle English. 
For schools in which both the Old and the Middle 
English periods are to be studied in one year or less, 
Professor MacLean's book is doubtless the best now 
available in this country. 

Dr. Murray'* Part VIII v Section I., of Dr. Mur- 
New English ray's "New English Dictionary" 
Dictionary. (Macmillan) is a thin quarto of about 

one hundred pages, and extends from Crouchmas to 
Czech, thus at once completing the letter C and the 
second volume of the colossal work. Volume Three 
will include D and E, Dr. Murray assuming respon- 
sibility for the former letter and Mr. Bradley for the 
latter. The "C " volume complete fills 1308 pages, 
C being next to S in dictionary dimensions, and 
including 29,295 main words, nearly as many as 
belong to S. The ten smallest letters, X, Y, Z, Q, K, 
J, N, U, V, and 0, taken together, might be brought 
into a volume of hardly greater dimensions than 
those of the volume now completed, whence we may 
see that the work will make greater apparent pro- 
gress in the future than it has up to the present 
time. Those who wax impatient at the leisurely 
advance of the work may take comfort from the 
story of the " Dictionnaire Historique de la Langue 
Francaise." That monument of erudition, begun 
by the Academy nearly fifty years ago, has just 
completed the letter A. Renan once prophesied 
that the work might be done in about twelve cen- 
turies, whereupon M. Bergerat made the skeptical 
comment: "M. Renan tells of only twelve centuries 
as being enough for the purpose, in order to keep 

up our spirits." 

"The Book of the Fair" (Bancroft) 

An elaborate . . , 

Memorial of the continues to appear in parts, and we 
World's Fair. have thus far received eleven of them. 
Beginning with number six, we note the completion 
of the chapter on the Manufacturers' exhibits, and 
the first pages of the chapter on the Liberal Arts. 
This chapter runs well into number seven, and gives 
an intelligent account of the Educational exhibit.

[Feb. 16, 



The Woman's department is next taken up, and gets 
rather more attention than Education. Machinery 
takes us well into part nine, where it is succeeded 
by Agriculture, which runs nearly through the tenth 
part. Part eleven is devoted to Electricity and Hor- 
ticulture. These parts of a very attractive work 
are abundantly supplied with processed illustrations, 
to which the text is really subordinated. The paper 
is heavy, smooth of finish, and receives the impres- 
sion well. There are to be twenty-five instalments 
of the work, which will form, when complete, a 
highly satisfactory memorial of the great undertak- 
ing to which it is devoted. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

There are many editions of Boswell, but for a com- 
bination of scholarly editing with inexpensive compact- 
ness, the two-volume set just published by Messrs. T. 
Y. Crowell & Co. deserves special commendation. Mr. 
Mowbray Morris is the editor. He has given all of 
Boswell's notes and a few of his own in addition. The 
typography is clear and the paper is good, while the 
price is low enough for most purses. 

The " Ariel " Shakespeare (Putnam) has been com- 
ing to ns in instalments of seven booklets to a box. To 
the seven " Comedies " and the seven " Histories " pre- 
viously published must now be added a series of seven 
" Tragedies " in the same neat form of issue. A second 
set of seven " Comedies " will soon follow, and the nine 
plays remaining will appear in due time. The " Poems " 
will eventually be added to the set, and the " Ariel " 
Shakespeare will be complete. 

We recently noticed the abridgment, by Colonel Al- 
fred Pearson, of the late J. A. Symonds's history of 
the Italian Renaissance. Our notice had reference to 
the English edition of that work, and now requires to 
be supplemented by mention of an American edition 
(Holt), published in neat form, and at less than half the 
price of the other. Those who wish to take their Sy- 
monds condensed (or perhaps pruned) will do well to 
possess themselves of this book. 

A pretty little volume, of vest-pocket dimensions, 
with flexible leather covers, of " The Thoughts of the 
Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus " in Long's trans- 
lation, has been edited by Mr. Edwin Ginn, and is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The editorial part of 
the booklet comprises a preface, a biography, an essay 
on the philosophy of the imperial sage, and an index. 
The biography and the essay are condensed from Long. 
A similar edition of Epictetus is promised by Mr. Ginn. 

" HazelPs Annual " for 1894 (imported by Scribner) 
covers the year 1893 up to the close of November, and 
remains one of the most useful of books for ready ref- 
erence to topics of current interest. The present issue 
contains a number of maps, such as Siarn, Matabeleland, 
and the Pamirs ; a lot of new biographies, such as 
Messrs. W. W. Astor, T. F. Bayard, W. E. Henley, 
William Watson, and Miss Ada Rehan; and timely ar- 
ticles upon such subjects as the Behring Sea question, 
the Home Rule Bill, Bimetallism, Influenza, and the 
World's Fair. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have just published Dr. 
C. A. Buchheim's school edition of the first four books 
of Goethe's " Dichtung und Wahrheit." The apparatus 



of notes is very full and satisfactory. The same pub- 
lishers also send us a " Complete Graded Arithmetic," 
in two volumes, by Mr. George E. Attwood; and, in 
their " Pedagogical Library," a two-volume treatise, by 
Mr. George Ricks, on " Object Lessons and How to 
Give Them." The parts of the two works just men- 
tioned are designed, respectively, for primary and gram- 
mar schools. 

"The Blind as Seen through Blind Eyes " (Putnam), 
translated from the French of M. Maurice de la Sizer- 
anne by Dr. F. Park Lewis, gives an excellent idea of 
the intellectual and moral character of those who have 
lost their sight, an account of the special methods em- 
ployed in their education, and a suggestion of the va- 
rious avenues (more numerous than one would suppose) 
open to such of them as must become self-supporting. 
A considerable part of the work is devoted to the life 
and labors of Valentine Haiiy, the French founder of 
schools for the blind. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish an abridged 
edition of Vigny's " Cinq-Mars " in their series of mod- 
ern language texts. Mr. Charles Sankey is the editor. 
The book is cut down to rather less than half-size, and 
provided with an excellent historical introduction. From 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. we have " Brigetta," one of Auer- 
bach's " Erzahluugen," edited by Dr. J. Howard Gore;, 
and " Popular Science," a volume of French readings 
edited by Dr. Jules Luquiens. The latter work consists 
of seven chapters, by such writers as MM. Maxime du 
Camp, C. Flammarion, and E. Re"clus. 

" The Significance of Names " (Whittaker), by Mr. 
Leopold Wagner, is a volume of roughly classified and 
curious information about the proper and other names 
comprised under such heads as " Nicknames of American 
States," " Titles of Honor," " Schools of Philosophy," 
and " Cordials and Beverages." The information given 
is sometimes astonishing, as when we read of Chicago: 
" It is called the White City, from the general aspect 
of its houses and public buildings, and the Windy City, 
owing to its exposed situation on the margin of a great 
lake." Other amusing trouvailles await the explorer of 
these pages. 

Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge's "The Mummy: Chapters 
on Egyptian Funeral Archaeology" (Macmillan) is a 
handsome volume issued by the Cambridge University 
Press. Its scope is considerably more comprehensive 
than the title would indicate, for it iflcludes Egyptian 
history and chronology, and a full account of the forms 
of Egyptian writing. The story of the Rosetta Stone is 
told at length, and the conflicting claims of Champol- 
lion and Young to the honor of its decipherment are 
carefully and dispassionately discussed. The work is 
abundantly illustrated. There are Egyptian gods, pyra- 
mids and other monuments, reproductions of notable 
inscriptions, and lists of hieroglyphs, scarabs, and royal 
cartouches. The work is thoroughly scientific and up 
to date. 

Under the title " The Evanston Colloquium," Messrs. 
Macmillau & Co. publish the "Lectures on Mathe- 
matics " delivered last summer at the Northwestern 
University, by Professor Felix Klein, of Gottingen. 
This course of lectures was given as a sort of annex to 
the proceedings of the Mathematical Congress given 
under the auspices of the World's Congress Auxiliary. 
The lectures are published from a report made by Pro- 
fessor Alexander Ziwet, and are followed by Professor 
Klein's historical sketch of " The Development of Mathe- 
matics at the German Universities." Among the sub-

jects discussed in the lectures are Clebsch and Sophus 
Lie, ideal numbers, and recent work in the non-Euclid- 
ean geometry. 

Since Mr. Stevenson published his " Child's Garden 
of Verse " there has been no such book of rhymes for 
the little ones as Miss Rossetti's "Sing-Song " (Macmil- 
lan). Here is an example: 

" The city mouse lives in a house ; 

The garden mouse lives in a bower, 

He's friendly with the frogs and toads, 

And sees the pretty plants in flower. 

" The city mouse eats bread and cheese ; 
The garden mouse eats what he can ; 
We will not grudge him seeds and stalks, 
Poor little timid furry man." 

The same publishers also send us an illustrated edition 
of " Goblin Market," Mr. Laurence Housman being the 
designer. He has happily seized the spirit of that fan- 
tastic and remarkable poem. 



YORK TOPICS. 

New York, Feb. 10, 1894. 

Sundry hints have reached me from time to time to 
the effect that the brief description, in an earlier letter, 
of the recently published " Liber Scriptorum " was not 
sufficient for the purposes of THE DIAL, and I have 
been asked to review the " Book of the Authors Club " 
for that journal. Probably the makers of this request 
scarcely realized its formidable nature. To sit in judg- 
ment on the work of one hundred and nine writers, and 
in a single article at that, is something which even Kit 
North might have shrunk from doing. Then again, if 
I am rightly informed, the " Liber Scriptorum " has 
not been offered for review to any periodical whatever, 
but the committee in charge of its publication, Mr. 
Rossiter Johnson, Mr. John D. Champlin, and Mr. 
George Gary Eggleston, have very gladly shown copies 
to representatives of papers which have wished to print 
articles about it. Some description of the volume and 
its contents is all that can be attempted. 

It is now nearly two years since the idea of publish- 
ing such a book was first proposed to members of the 
Club. The suggestion met with immediate favor, but 
it has taken a great deal of time to obtain the articles 
contributed, to have the sheets printed and signed by 
the contributors, to have the hand-made paper manu- 
factured in Holland, and to design and prepare the spe- 
cial binding used. Passing over details mentioned in 
my former letter, it is perhaps well to say that the com- 
pleted books, in every feature of printing and binding, 
are the sole work of the De Vinne Press, the managers 
of which have spent much time and thought in their 
preparation. The handsome volumes are bound in dark 
maroon leather, with gilt tops and uncut edges, and are 
sold at $100 each. Most of the edition of 250 copies 
has been disposed of, and Mr. Henry T. Thomas, the 
publisher, of 13 Astor Place, New York, who is a per- 
sonal friend of many members of the Club, has taken 
charge of the sale of the remainder, thereby relieving 
the committee of their long trusteeship. 

Now, the only practical arrangement of the contribu- 
tions to such a work is alphabetically, according to the 
names of the writers. This arrangement gave first 
place to my friend, Mr. Henry Abbey, the poet, of 
Kingston, N. Y., who would be very loth to seek such 



prominence of his own accord. But he responded nobly 
to the occasion, and, indeed, has written one of the finest 
things in the book, a sonnet embodying the sentiment of 
its writers. I take the liberty of quoting it in full. 

" TO BAFFLE TIME. 
" To baffle time, whose tooth has never rest, 

And make the counted line, from page to page, 
Compact, fulfilled of what is apt and best, 

And vibrant with the key-note of the age, 
This is my aim ; and even aims are things ; 

They give men value who have won no place. 

We pass for what we would be, by some grace, 
And our ambitions make us seem like kings. 
But never yet has destiny's clear star 

For aimless feet shed light upon the way. 
So have I hope, since purpose sees no bar, 

To write immortally some lyric day, 

As Lovelace did when he informed the lay 
Inspired by his Lucasta and the war." 

Each author being at liberty to write what he pleases, 
we find Dr. Felix Adler contributing an interesting study 
of Sir Thomas More, while Mr. Henry M. Alden, of 
" Harper's Magazine," has prepared a " fireside study," 
" Flammantia Mcenia Mundi," in his most mystical 
vein. It is not surprising to find Mr. Poultney Bige- 
low writing about " Russian Rule as It Is Felt by Ten 
Millions of the Unorthodox," and no one will look for 
complimentary references to Russia and the Russians 
in such an article. It contains some of his interesting 
personal experiences while in Poland. From San Fran- 
cisco, Mr. John Vance Cheney sends a dainty little 
poem, " Noon in the Hills," while Major Joseph Kirk- 
land tells the story of Jean Baptiste Pointe de Sable, 
whose identity need not be explained to Chicagoans. 
From England Mr. Harold Frederic and Mr. Henry 
Harland contribute a story and a poem respectively. 
Mr. Harland's poem, entitled " The King's Touch," is 
quite Browningesque in style, and is the first from his 
pen which I remember to have seen. Poems by Colonel 
Hay, Mr. Gilder, and Mr. Howells lend to the distinc- 
tion of the volume, and a pathetic story by Mark Twain, 
" The Californian's Tale," shows how completely each 
contributor has followed his own impulse in writing for 
" Liber Scriptorum," rather than the expectation of the 
reader. 

Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie gives free play to his deli- 
cate fancy in " My Search for the Goddess," following 
next to Dr. Ludlow's sketch, " Afloat on the ^Egean." 
Prof. Josiah Royce contributes a long and thoughtful 
essay on " Tolstoi and the Unseen Moral Order." Some 
of the lighter articles are Mr. Warner's " Literature in 
a Dress Suit," Mr. Hopkinson Smith's " How to Train 
Our Wives and Children," and Mr. Stockton's " Pomo- 
na's Club." Pomona is made to preach so clever a ser- 
mon on a burning literary question of the day that I 
cannot forbear quoting the most of it. 

"The human race [Pomona says] is divided into women 
and men, and literatoor is divided into romantickism and real- 
istics. And the great trouble with both of them is that some- 
times there is too much of one and not enough of the other. 
Everybody knows that we can't git along without realistics, 
that is, a certain amount of 'em ; but if a boy puts too 
much rag-tag and bobtail to his kite, he can't make it fly. 
There's times when you might git a kite up into the air with- 
out any tail, though it would be apt to spin about in an un- 
certain way. But nobody could make a tail fly without any 
kite. 

" In ray opinion, the worst thing about facts is that they 
are too common. Everybody's got 'em piled up around 'em 
and all over the ground. . . .

"But when the beautiful snows of romantickism come 
floatin' down and cover up all them facts, and spread a lovely 
white veil, like the icin' on a pound-cake, over all nature and 
art, then them facts is of some use ; they make a foundation 
for the snow and keep it from bio win' away. And what was 
perfectly horrid a little while ago becomes like dazzlin' 
mounds, and domes, and minarets a-sparklin' in the sun." 

Bravo, Pomona ! One question is settled at last. I 
half forget whether your views coincide with those of 
Mr. Howells or with those of Mr. Quiller-Couch. It 
must be one or the other, for Pomona never takes mid- 
dle ground with anyone or anything, be it lightning-rod 
peddlers or literature. On second thoughts, it must be 
Quiller-Couch. 

It is, then, only possible to mention a few of the con- 
tributors to "Liber Scriptorum." They have cheer- 
fully done their part, in the hope that a sufficient fund 
might be obtained to provide their democratic little or- 
ganization with permanent quarters. Their expectation 
is about to be realized. The Authors Club is now in a 
most flourishing condition, and those who founded it 
and held to it during its early progress have been re- 
warded by the great benefits resulting to the writing 
guild in social and even professional directions. 

The original manuscripts of all the articles contributed 
to " Liber Scriptorum " have been inlaid in uniform 
sheets, and bound up in three large volumes in crushed 
Levant morocco. They have been on exhibition all this 
week in Tiffany's window, Union Square, and have at- 
tracted crowds of people all day long, being opened at 
the autographs of some of the best known writers. The 
three volumes will be sold, as one lot, to the highest 
bidder. ARTHUR STEDMAN. 



LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



Mr. Walter Besant is soon to publish two volumes of 
miscellaneous papers, entitled, respectively, " Literary 
Essays " and " Social Essays." 

Mrs. Humphry Ward's new novel, " Marcella," will 
appear very soon. The author's recent illness has pre- 
vented earlier publication of the work. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. will publish early in 
March a work by Mr. Edward Porritt, of London, on 
the various departments of the municipal and national 
life of England. It bears the comprehensive title of 
"The Englishman at Home: His Responsibilities and 
Privileges." 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons announce that they are 
now printing the seventh thousand of the authorized 
American edition of Miss Harraden's clever story, 
" Ships that Pass in the Night." Of the English edi- 
tion, over 17,000 copies have been sold. To meet the 
popular demand for the book, Messrs. Putnam propose 
to issue immediately a railroad edition in paper covers. 

The London " Athenseum," summing up the English 
literature of 1 893, remarks that the year has been " given 
over almost entirely to the younger writers, who have 
discovered one another throughout its course with unani- 
mous and touching enthusiasm. The older men have 
been silent, while the juniors have enjoyed the distinc- 
tion of limited editions and the luxury of large sales." 

Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. will publish some 
time in March the first number of a quarterly magazine 
of bibliography. It will consist of a series of papers by 
writers of authority on various points of book-lore. A 



novel departure has been taken in fixing beforehand 
that the magazine is only to last for three years, end- 
ing, no matter what its success, with the appearance of 
the twelfth number in December, 1896. Subscribers 
will thus know from the first when their set will be com- 
plete. 

It is stated by a correspondent of the New York 
" Evening Post " that the editorship of the new " Revue 
de Paris " was offered to M. Brunetiere before he was 
elected by the stockholders of the " Revue des Deux 
Mondes." His election was opposed by M. Pailleron, 
who has even threatened legal proceedings to oust him. 
M. Brunetiere was elected by the influence of Mine. 
Buloz. M. Pailleron, who is a son-in-law of Mme. Bu- 
loz, wished the novelist, M. Victor Cherbuliez, to occupy 
the editorial chair of the great semi-monthly. 

According to "The Bookman," there is to be a 
" Kelmscott " Shelley. Mr. Morris has consented to 
print an edition of the poet's works, which will be ar- 
ranged and edited by Mr. F. S. Ellis, whose edition of 
Keats has just been completed for the press. The 
" Shelley " is to be issued in three volumes, which will 
contain the whole of the longer works, together with 
most of the lyrics and other minor poems. Mr. Ellis 
intends to omit all the translations and comicalities 
(such as " Peter Bell " and Swellfoot the Tyrant "), 
and also the fragments and unfinished work generally. 

The Trustees of the Columbia University Press have 
made an arrangement with Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 
of New York and London to act as the publishers of 
the Press for a term of years. By this arrangement 
the works which shall bear the imprint of the Columbia 
University Press will profit by the unusually ample fa- 
cilities of distribution possessed by Messrs. Macmillan 
& Co., not only in the United States and Great Britain, 
but also on the continent of Europe and in the British 
colonies. It is to be noted also that Messrs. Macmillan 
& Co. have recently published or have now in prepara- 
tion works by a number of Columbia instructors, in- 
cluding Professor Boyeseu, Professor Cattell, Dr. Eg- 
bert, Prof. Brander Matthews, Professor Perry, and 
others. 

MR. LESLIE STEPHEN ON MATTHEW ARNOLD. 

From Mr. Leslie Stephen's recent article on Matthew 
Arnold, in " The National Review," we make the fol- 
lowing pithy extract: 

" Putting on a mask, sometimes of levity, sometimes 
of mere literary dandyism, with an irony which some- 
times is a little too elaborate, but which often expresses 
the keenest intelligence trying to pass itself off as sim- 
plicity, he was a skirmisher, but a skirmisher who did 
more than most heavily-armed warriors against the 
vast oppressive reign of stupidity and prejudice. He 
made the old dragon Philistine (to use his phrase) wince 
at times, and showed the ugliness and clumsiness of the 
creature; and after all he did it in a spirit as of one 
who recognized the monster was after all a most kindly 
monster at bottom. He may be enlisted in useful serv- 
ice if you can only apply the goad successfully; and 
made effective, in his ponderous way, like the Cartha- 
ginian elephant, if only you can mount his neck and 
goad him in the right direction. No single arm is suf- 
ficient for such a task; the dragon shakes himself and 
goes to sleep again in a stertorous and rather less com- 
placent fashion, let us hope ! and we feel that the strug- 
gle will too probably endure till we have ceased to be 
personally interested. 

" I cannot, indeed, get it out of my head that we

slow-footed and prosaic persons sometimes make our 
ground surer; and that, for example, poor Bishop Col- 
enso, whom Arnold ridiculed as the typical Philistine 
critic, did some good service with his prosaic arithmetic. 
There are cases in which the four rules are better than 
the finest critical insight. But there is room for poets 
as well as for arithmeticians; and Arnold, as at once 
poet and critic, has the special gift if I may trust my 
own experience- of making one feel silly and tasteless 
when one has uttered a narrow-minded, crude, or un- 
generous sentiment; and I dip into his writings to re- 
ceive a shock, unpleasant at times, but excellent in its 
effects as an intellectual tonic." 



THE DUTY ON BOOKS : A LETTER FROM HON. 
WILLIAM EVERETT, M. C. 

The House of Representatives having failed to re- 
spond to the appeal made by the educated classes for the 
removal of the stupid duty on imported English books, 
the missionary efforts of the friends of culture should now 
be directed upon the Senate, and it is yet quite possible 
that the reform may be accomplished. Meanwhile, the 
following letter addressed to President Gates of Am- 
herst College by Dr. William Everett will be found in- 
teresting. Dr. Everett took an active part in urging 
upon the Ways and Means Committee the desirability 
of the reform, and stood sponsor for a large number of 
THE DIAL'S petitioners, among whom were President 
Gates and the faculty of Amherst. 
President Merrill E. Gates, LL.D., Amherst College, 

Mass.: 

" MY DEAR SIR: I had the honor to present to the 
House of Representatives, for the consideration of the 
committee on ways and means, the petition of yourself 
and your associates for the removal of the duty on 
books printed wholly or in part in the English language. 
Similar petitions came in through myself and others, 
from many universities and colleges, and from individ- 
uals of the first consideration who understand the in- 
terests of literature and education. I am absolutely 
in sympathy with the petition. I called the attention 
of more than one member of the committe on ways and 
means to the propriety of removing what, with you, I 
consider an inexcusable burden on a heavily burdened 
and ill-paid class. I had hoped to see free books in the 
bill; I dwelt on the subject in my speech; and I duly 
filed with the chairman of the committee of the whole 
an amendment in accordance with your petition. I am 
sorry that this and others could not have been presented 
at an earlier stage, though I am afraid its success was 
problematical. 

" There was one fortnight devoted to amendments, 
as the chairman recognized their proposers. Far the 
greater part of this time was absorbed in lengthy dis- 
cussions on amendments offered by the committee on 
ways and means. The rest of the time was given, after 
eager competition, to the representatives of various im- 
portant industrial interests, who felt that their constit- 
uents were injured by the bill as it stood. The chair- 
man was anxious to be perfectly fair in recognizing the 
proposers of amendments; but their number was be- 
yond satisfactory arrangement. I found very early that 
it was almost impossible for me to get in the amend- 
ment for free books in time and so it ultimately proved. 
Even if I had got it in, it would have been subject to 
serious opposition from influential quarters. That I 
should have been willing to try to overcome; but I saw 
more than one amendment, boldly and skilfully sup- 



ported, fall before the simple opposition of the committee 
on ways and means, who admitted the force of the ar- 
gument, but declared that after careful consideration 
they believed the duty should be retained. Under the 
circumstances, I was obliged, slowly and painfully, to 
renounce the hope of presenting and advocating the 
claims of my own guild a set of quiet modest men and 
women, scattered all over the country, working under 
heavy burdens for inadequate pay, and yet with this 
extra burden on what are for them the tools of trade. 
" I trust you will not fail in pressing the objects of 
your petition in all public and private ways, and I can 
assure you of my sympathy, which shall take a practical 
form at every moment that I see a practical opening. 
Most respectfully yours, WILLIAM EVERETT." 



ELABORATION IN POETIC ART. 

A recent critique, by Mr. Theodore Watts, in " The 
Athenaeum," includes the following considerations upon 
the labor limce of the poet : " The subject of elabora- 
tion in poetic art, especially by Rossetti and Tennyson, 
remains still to be adequately handled by the poetic 
critic. Improvisatorial poetry, so easy in Italian, is 
impossible in a language so rich in rhyme-emphasis, 
and yet so comparatively restricted in rhymes, as En- 
glish. But while it may be said that in English the 
warring between the emphasis natural to the rhymed 
structure and the emphasis natural to the subject-mat- 
ter of the poem cannot be appeased offhand, it must 
also be said that the very cause which makes it more 
difficult to rhyme in English than in Italian is really 
one of the causes of the superiority of English rhyming 
over Italian rhyming. In Italian, where so many of 
the words rhyme with each other, the rhyme lends none 
of that sting to the thing said which is lent by English 
rhyme. It was this stinging effect of the rhyme-em- 
phasis of English poetry which gave Chaucer his ad- 
vantage over Langland's work in the great struggle be- 
tween the scansion of alliterative bars and the scansion 
of the rhyme-pause which we have before alluded to. 
No good rhymed verse can exist in English, however, 
without more or less elaboration on the part of the poet. 
It is mainly in their methods of manipulation that poets 
differ in this matter. And it would be easy to show 
that in this respect English poets have to be divided 
into three classes: those who elaborate the material in 
their own minds, and bring it to perfection, or almost 
to perfection, before setting down the words on paper; 
those who jot down their verses in the rough, but begin 
to change them before ever the ink is dry; and those 
whose elaborations are mainly effected after the verses 
have passed into type. To some poets the sight of their 
verses in manuscript produces that sense of finality 
which to others only comes by the sight of their verses 
in type. To others, again, not even type itself produces 
the sense of finality. 

" The nearest approach to improvisatorial work was 
that of Byron; but then, great as was Byron's poetic 
energy, his verses are so loose that, as regards the 
merely artistic qualities, they are not much more than 
poetry in solution. Judging from what we know of 
the rarest fruit of the genius of Keats, the 'Ode to 
a Nightingale,' Keats seems to have belonged to those 
who have the power of elaborating the verses in the 
mind and then rolling them over the tongue, so to speak, 
before setting them down on paper. But spontaneous 
as seems this glorious ode, no one will contend that it 
has more apparent spontaneity than Shelley's Ode to 



122 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



the West Wind ' or his < Skylark,' and yet if Shelley 
were to be judged by the state of some of the manu- 
script he left behind he would be ranged among the 
least spontaneous of poets. Dr. Garnett tells us of en- 
tire sheets of manuscript so cut about that in some cases 
one line only would be finally left to stand upon a page. 
From this it would appear that while in Keats's case 
the passage of the line or sequence from its first crude 
form to perfection was partly achieved in the poet's 
brain before the pen was taken in hand, in Shelley's 
case this process went on during the very act of writing. 
" There is, however, as we have hinted above, a third 
class of poets to whom neither manuscript nor type has 
any suggestion of finality, and to this class Rossetti be- 
longed. Although he did undoubtedly make altera- 
tions in his verses while in manuscript, it was when they 
lay before him in the sharpness of type that he saw how 
far from, or how near to, his ideal of poetic expression 
he had brought himself. And yet, howsoever great had 
been the corrections he had introduced in his proofs, 
the printed page never did suggest finality to him. 
From the first appearance of ' Sister Helen,' when the 
poet was not much more than a boy, down to the year 
preceding that of his death, the ballad was subject to 
changes. And in this, as in certain other matters, he 
was like Coleridge, that his changes were almost always 
improvements."

THREE NOTEWORTHY BOOKS. 



THE EVE OF THE FRENCH 
REVOLUTION. 

By EDWARD J. LOWELL. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

" We find his book to be as thorough as it is read- 
able. ... A better exposition of the proximate causes 
of the Revolution and a more trustworthy account of 
the political and social institutions of the age that pre- 
cede it need not be desired." New York Examiner. 

" A penetrating, subtle, and comprehensive review of 
the ante-revolutionary situation." The Literary World. 

"A book of conspicuous ability and interest." The 
Scotsman, Edinburgh. 

THE SON OF A PROPHET. 

By GEORGE ANSON JACKSON. 16mo, $1.25. 

" We do not hesitate to rank this story in respect 
to both interest and power with < Ben-Hur ' and ' The 
Prince of India.' It resembles them, especially the 
former, so much that the reader recalls them at once, 
and that must needs be a remarkable work which does 
not suffer by such a suggested comparison. But this 
one does not suffer." The Congregationalist, Boston. 



SAM HOUSTON 

And the War of Independence in Texas. 

By ALFRED M. WILLIAMS, author of " The Poets 

and Poetry of Ireland." With a Portrait and 

Map. 8vo, $2.00. 

" In this very attractive and fascinating volume Mr. 
Williams has performed a really important service to 
American history." Philadelphia Times. 

" In the literary excellence of Mr. Williams's literary 
work, as well as in the subject he has treated, we have 
one of the most valuable contributions of the year to 
American history and biography." Boston Traveller. 

" The deepest impression his book makes on the per- 
sonal side is that of absolute truthfulness." Chicago 
Journal. 

"A good book upon a man whose like will probably 
never be seen again in this country." N. Y. Tribune. 

" A very readable and interesting book, a real con- 
tribution to American history and biography." Charles- 
ton News and Courier.

in judgment and vividly pictorial in style." Philadel- 
phia Public Ledger.

Discovery of Lakes Rudolf and Stefanie: 

An Account of Count SAMUEL TELEKI'S Exploring and Hunting Expedition in 
Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1887 and 1888. 

By his Companion, Lieutenant LUDWIG VON HOHNEL. Translated by NANCY BELL (L. d'Anvers). 

" Sport, discovery, and science contribute in this narrative to form a book of surpassing interest. . . . The result is that a book which is full 
of exciting adventures with wild beasts and wild men in a strange country yields also in every chapter matter which the geographer, the natur- 
alist, and the anthropologist will account of solid and peculiar value." Scotsman. 

" A splendid book of travel. . . . The illustrations are themselves of the highest interest. No such series of pictures have we ever found ii> 
a book of travel ; full of life and vigor they are, and without an apparent element of exaggeration, though many of them make the nerves thrill 
with a sense of almost personal danger. . . . From all points of view general interest, scientific value, exciting adventure, and perfect illustra- 
tion Lieutenant von Ho'hnel's work is not far from the best that have been produced out of the Dark Continent." Daily Chronicle.

"A romance which will rank among the masterpieces of modern fiction" ADVERTISER, Boston. 

A Gentleman of France: 

Being the Memoirs of Gaston de Bonne, Sieur de Marsac. 

By STANLEY J. WEYMAN, author of " The House of the Wolf," etc. With Frontispiece and Vignette by 

J. H. FORD. 12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 



" One of the best novels since 'Lorua Doone.' It will be read and 
then re-read for the mere pleasure its reading gives. The subtle charm 
of it is not in merely transporting the nineteenth-century reader to the 
sixteenth, that he may see life as it was then, but in transforming him 
into a sixteenth-century man, thinking its thoughts and living its life 
in perfect touch with sympathy." N. Y. World. 



"No novelist outside of France has displayed a more definite com- 
prehension of the very essence of mediaeval French life, and no one, 
certainly, has been able to set forth a depiction of it in colors so vivid 
and so entirely in consonance with the truth. . . . The characters in 
the tale are admirably drawn, and the narrative is nothing less than 
fascinating in its fine flavor of adventure." Beacon, Boston. 



" A romance after the style of Dumas the elder, and well worthy of being read by those who can enjoy stirring adventures told in true 
romantic fashion. . . . The great personages of the time Henry III. of Valois, Henry IV., Rosny, Rambouillet, Turenne are brought in skil- 
fully, and the tragic and varied history of the time forms a splendid frame in which to set the picture of Marsac's love and courage. . . . The 
troublous days are well described, and the interest is genuine and lasting, for up to the very end the author manages effects which impel the 
reader to go on with renewed curiosity." The Nation, N. Y. 



A New Novel by Miss DOUGALL. 

What Necessity Knows. 

By Miss L. DOUGALL, author of "Beggars All." Crown 8vo, cloth, $1.00. 

Miss Dougall's new novel is a careful study of Canadian life and character, and has much of the originality and much of 
the intellectual and spiritual elevation which have made the success of her first story, " Beggars All." 

" Miss Dougall, in this, her latest production, shows a ripeness of thought, fertility of invention, and surety of method even superior to those 
qualities as they were exhibited in ' Beggars All. ' . . . ' What Necessity Knows ' is one of the novels that must be read. It is easy to predict for 
Miss Dougall a very distinct place among the writers of English fiction." Boston Beacon. 

" We think we are well within the mark in saying that this novel is one of the three or four best novels of the year. The author is eminently 
thoughtful, yet the story is not distinctively one of moral purpose. The play of character and the clash of purpose are finely wrought out. . . . 
What gives the book its highest value is really the author's deep knowledge of motive and character. The reader continually comes across keen 
observations and subtle expressions that not infrequently recall George Eliot. The novel is one that is worth reading a second time." Outlook, 
New York.

THE DIAL'S

The Annual Spring Announcement Number of 
THE DIAL will be issued March 16, and will con- 
tain the usual classified list of the books to be is- 
sued this Spring by the American publishers. This 
Announcement Number, and a similar one in the 
Fall, have become a well-known feature of THE 
DIAL, and proved to be among the most important 
issues of the year. No pains will be spared to make 
the forthcoming List of Spring Books as complete 
and accurate as possible ; and to this end publishers 
are requested to send full and prompt information 
which will, of course, be printed without charge. 
It is desired that all houses in the regular trade 
shall be represented the smaller no less than the 
larger ones ; since the former are apt to suffer some- 
what from lack of their own advertising announce- 
ments, and hence their often meritorious publica- 
tions are more likely to be overlooked by readers 
and the trade. It is intended that none shall be 
excluded from this Spring List save by their own 
neglect.

entertaining anecdotes and introspective apercus of character." ] 

London Telegraph.

may well dispense with the perusual of previous authorities. . . . 

His work, on the whole, is comprehensive, conscientious, and eminently 

fair." London Chronicle. 

THE ROMANCE OF AN EMPRESS. 

Catharine II. of Russia. By K. WALISZEWSKI. With Por- 
trait. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

" Few stories in history are more romantic than that of Catharine 
II. of Russia, with its mysterious incidents and thrilling episodes ; few 
characters present more curious problems. . . . This volume, in which 
the Empress is the grand central figure, gives striking pictures of the 
condition of the contemporary Russia which she did so much to mold 
as well as to expand. . . . Indeed, with her vices, and with all her 
faults, as M. Waliszewski has sketched her portrait, we can hardly 
help liking as well as admiring her." London Times. 

THE BRONTES IN IRELAND.

General Wright's book is a work of popular interest. The 
subject is one of the most picturesque and impressive to be 
found in our military history, and the author, in availing him- 
self of the latest authorities, has produced a book which seems 
likely to be accepted as a standard work in its class. 

THE FAUNA OF THE DEEP SEA.

Cambridge. A new volume in the Modern Science Series, 
edited by Sir JOHN LUBBOCK, Bart. With 23 illustrations. 
12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" Our present-day knowledge of the physical conditions of the bot- 
tom of the deep sea and the animals that dwell there is by no means in- 
considerable. ... It is the object of this little book to bring together 
in a small compass some of the more important facts and considerations, 
and to present them in such a form that they may be of interest to 
those who do not possess a specialist's knowledge of genera and species. "

number of readers of his popular astronomical works that this

HOW TO STUDY AND TEACH HISTORY, 

With Particular Reference to the History of the United States. 
By B. A. HINSDALE. Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of the Sci- 
ence and the Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan, 
author of " Schools and Studies," etc. Vol. 25, Interna- 
tional Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The aim of this book is practical, and it was written with 
particular reference to the needs of elementary and secondary 
teachers, although it will be found of interest and value to 
teachers and students of all grades. It is one of the most im- 
portant and valuable volumes in the series. 

BENEFITS FORGOT. 

By WOLCOTT BALESTIER, author of " Reffey," " A Common 

Story," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This is the story which attracted such wide-spread atten-

novel of American life, combining a command of incident and 
movement with a rare power of analysis and observation.

By Mrs. ALEXANDER, author of "The Wooing o't," "For 
His Sake," etc. No. 134, Town and Country Library. 
12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

The author of " The Wooing o't " needs no introduction to 
American readers. In her next book she offers a most sym- 
pathetic study of a woman's character, with a picture of an 
unconventional hero, the whole forming a story of sustained 
interest and merit.

MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING 
AND SPRACHMEISTEREI. 

The friends of modern language instruction 
have reason to congratulate themselves upon 
the progress made during recent years in that 
department of education. Nearly every Amer- 
ican college of any standing has a corps of 
trained instructors in French and German at 
least, if not in Italian and Spanish also. That 
these instructors take their work seriously is 
shown by the grammatical and philological 
manuals, and by the carefully-edited modern 
language texts that they have been preparing 
in such numbers since 1880, and that pub- 
lishers have found it profitable to produce. 
Twenty years ago, the only manuals availa- 
ble for the use of the instructor in this coun- 
try were works of the Ahn-Otto-Fasquelle- 
Ollendorf type, and texts of a very few among 
the most hackneyed of the classics. Now, the 
instructor has his choice among many scien- 
tific manuals, and among still more attractive 
and interesting texts. Moreover, those of our 
teachers who take seriously the work of modern 
language instruction have now carried on for ten 
years an association the Modern Language 
Association of America which has been justi- 
fied by its works, and which stands in the front 
rank of the learned societies of this country. 

The pedagogical section of this Association 
held a meeting a few weeks ago for the discus- 
sion of the important subject of methods of in- 
struction. Mr. E. H. Babbitt reported this 
meeting for the February " Educational Re- 
veiw," and from his report we extract a passage 
that we have read with peculiar satisfaction : 
" Dr. Rambeau made the point that in Ger- 
many the Sprachmeister, whose business is to 
impart a practical knowledge of the spoken 
language, is classified with the music and danc- 
ing master, where he belongs, and has no more 
to do with the work of liberal education than 
they. There is even more reason why he should 
be so classified in this country; the /Sprach- 
meister and his methods have no more place 
in our higher schools and colleges than teach- 
ers of piano-playing and type-writing. But 
the fact is, that when a generation ago modern 
languages were first thought of among us as a 
factor in a liberal education, the Sprachmeister 



130 



[March l r 



were the only people in the country who could 
teach them, and had to be taken to do the work 
in the colleges. Some of them rose to the oc- 
casion and became real educators, with a true 
sense of the relations of their work, but many 
more did not, and so the modern language in- 
struction in this country is still tinged with 
Sprachmeisterei to an extent which seriously 
impairs its usefulness and dignity." In con- 
nection with these remarks Dr. Rambeau fur- 
ther stated that " the public, even the educa- 
tional public, still believes that the only end 
and aim of studying a modern language is the 
ability to speak it," and the following surpris- 
ing note is attached : " In a paper on the edu- 
cational value of modern languages, read re- 
cently before the Middle States Association of 
Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the view re- 
ferred to was taken apparently as a matter of 
course, and no one challenged it in the discus- 
sion which followed." 

That the condition of things in the Middle 
and Western States is not quite as desperate 
as would appear from the note above quoted 
may be illustrated by the fact that a similar 
School and College Conference was held at the 
University of Chicago last November, and that 
the paper read upon the subject of modern lan- 
guage teaching (to which subject the Confer- 
ence was largely given over) expressed views 
entirely in agreement with those of Dr. Ram- 
beau. These views, while they evoked dissent 
from a few belated educators (mostly from the 
country districts), seemed to meet the approval 
of the majority of those engaged in the Con- 
ference. The paper in question has just been 
published in " The School Review." A per- 
tinent passage in this paper states the difficulty 
that our modern language instructor (at least 
below the college) has as yet hardly begun to 
overcome, and that should be made the object 
of a persistent and unwearying crusade on the 
part of all who have at heart the success of this 
important branch of education. The passage 
speaks of " that great divergence of educated 
from common opinion which every educator 
must squarely face, for the popular verdict says 
that students of a foreign language should learn 
to speak it, while the educator as emphatic- 
ally asserts that they should learn to read it, 
and that it makes little difference whether they 
learn to speak it or not." This is the educa- 
tional, as distinguished from the Sprachmeister, 
view of the question, and it will take a great 
deal of hammering to get it into the heads of 
the well-meaning but not highly-intelligent pub- 



lic upon which most of our lower schools, and 
many of our colleges, depend for their support. 
There are few departments of our secondary 
instruction in which reform is more needed than 
in that now under consideration, for the waste 
of time and energy at present going on is sim- 
ply enormous. The serious objects of modern 
language teaching are being neglected in a vast 
number of high schools, in order that children 
may be taught to chatter upon a limited range 
of useless subjects in a language that nine- 
tenths of them will never have any real occa- 
sion to employ. As long as our schools pre- 
tend to be educational institutions, it is their 
business to educate, and not to encourage 
merely ornamental accomplishments ; to keep 
in view the needs, not the vanities, of the human 
soul. The real objects of modern language 
work are, of course, to get access to a new lit- 
erature, and to reach a better realization, by 
translation and comparative study, of the his- 
tory, the resources, and the force of English 
speech. The recent report of the Committee 
of Ten very properly emphasizes these objects, 
and the influence of the Modern Language As- 
sociation is almost wholly in the direction of 
their accomplishment. But the inertia of the 
public consciousness should be reckoned with,, 
and educational effort must not relax. Every 
year our universities are sending out young men 
and women who understand what modern lan- 
guage teaching should be, and who are compe- 
tent to undertake it. It is the business of our 
schools to secure these people as teachers, impos- 
ing no vexatious restrictions upon their work, 
and to relegate the Sprachmeister to his proper 
function of coaching people who wish to go 
abroad or to shine in a society which accepts 
the gilding for the pure metal. He certainly 
has no business in the school unless he is will- 
ing to abandon the methods demanded of him 
by his private pupils, and rise to the educa- 
tional occasion offered by connection with an 
institution for serious training. 



THE SUPPRESSION OF "FOREIGN 
IDEAS." 

The educated opinion of this country is practically 
unanimous in favoring a removal of the stupid tariff 
upon English books, but Mr. Henry Carey Baird 
(of Philadelphia) is "agin it." Some of his ob- 
jections are stated in a letter to " The Publishers' 
Weekly," which journal recently placed itself in 
very distinct terms upon the side of free books. We 
quote a significant passage from Mr. Baird's letter : 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



131 



" The idea that taxation is necessary to the very ex- 
istence of society, and that no productive industry in a 
country can escape it, seems to be wholly overlooked 
and ignored by those theorists, like yourself, who would 
benefit students and others while sacrificing the fun- 
damental rights of domestic producers. ... In a 
word, the policy which you advocate is highly unjust, 
because it would discriminate against the American pub- 
lisher. As for the student himself, and for the State, 
it may be said with entire truth that many of these for- 
eign books, which you would allow him the privilege of 
importing free, would teach him doctrines which are 
utterly antagonistic to the best interests of American 
society, such free importation, in that case, thus being 
against public policy. The fact is, this country, through 
the medium of the college, is being honeycombed and 
our civilization is being threatened with destruction, by 
reason of the absorbing of foreign ideas, especially En- 
glish, and of an economic character. Rather would I 
put a prohibitive tariff on books containing such ideas 
than admit those books free of duty." 

Partisans of Mr. Baird's type are not usually as out- 
spoken as this. As a rule, while mentally carrying 
to its logical conclusion their fundamental assump- 
tion that all ideas not in accordance with their own 
should be suppressed, they contrive to cover their 
intolerance with the veil of some sort of rhetorical 
verbiage. But Mr. Baird scorns such subterfuges, 
and the expression of his fanaticism is refreshingly 
frank. In spite of his protest, and of his curious 
notions of "public policy," we imagine that the 
honeycombing work of enlightenment will go on, 
whatever superstructure may suffer from the pro- 
cess. The age and country in which he lives must 
seem sadly out of joint. He should have been born 
a Chinaman or a Mohammedan. As the latter, he 
would have gloated over the destruction of all books 
that did not agree with the Koran; and as the 
former, he would have occupied the most approved 
patriotic standpoint in seeking to protect his nation 
from the deadly invasions of foreign culture. As an 
American Mr. Baird is distinctly misplaced, and as 
a modern he is as decidedly out of date. Our tariff 
laws have been made to accomplish many purposes 
besides that of providing revenue for the govern- 
ment, but this is the first time, to our knowledge, 
that anyone has proposed that they should also as- 
sume the function of an intellectual censorship. 



ENGLISH AT HARVARD* 

During the present year the teachers of English 
at Harvard are three professors, two assistant pro- 
fessors, three instructors appointed for terms of 
more than one year, five instructors appointed for

one year, and seven assistants, a total of twenty. 
During the present year these teachers have in 
charge nine courses and seventeen half-courses. A 
whole course at Harvard meets three hours a week 
throughout the year; and a half -course either three 
hours a week for half the year, or once a week for 
the whole. In addition to the courses actually in 
progress, one course and seven half-courses an- 
nounced by the department of English are not given 
this year, but have been given in the past, and will 
be given in the future, alternating with some of 
those now in hand. Statistics as to the number of 
students enrolled this year are not readily available. 

The forthcoming report of the Dean of the Faculty 
of Arts and Sciences shows that the state of affairs 
last year, which may be taken as typical, was as fol- 
lows : In nine full courses, including the English 
Composition prescribed for Freshmen which num- 
bered 499 there were 52 Graduate Students, 113 
Seniors, 119 Juniors, 136 Sophomores, 377 Fresh- 
men, 88 Special Students, 62 Scientific Students, 
1 Divinity Student, and 3 Law Students, a total 
of 952 enrollments. In thirteen half-courses in- 
cluding the courses in English Composition pre- 
scribed for Sophomores and for Juniors, which to- 
gether numbered 648, there were 58 Graduate 
Students, 188 Seniors, 382 Juniors, 281 Sopho- 
mores, 12 Freshmen, 51 Special Students, 25 Scien- 
tific Students, 1 Divinity Student, 3 Law Students, 
and 1 Student of Agriculture, a total of 998 en- 
rollments. No statistics are available as to how 
many of these students were enrolled in more than 
one of the courses under consideration. These figures, 
then, are valuable chiefly in showing the amount of 
teaching, in terms of courses and half-courses, actu- 
ally demanded from the teachers. It may be added, 
however, that no Freshman is commonly admitted 
to an elective course in English, while for the reg- 
ular half-course in English Composition prescribed 
for Sophomores there is an alternative elective full 
course in the same subject, in which last year 122 
Sophomores were enrolled. The full course in En- 
glish Composition prescribed for Freshmen, and the 
half-courses in the same subject prescribed for the 
two years following, comprise all the required work 
in English at Harvard. 

In the course prescribed for Freshmen, Professor 
A. S. Hill's " Principles of Rhetoric " is used as a 
text-book. Lectures based thereon are given, and 
also lectures dealing with some aspects of English 
Literature. Of these lectures students are required 
to write summaries. Besides this written work, 
every member of the class writes a composition in 
the class-room once a week ; and these compositions 
are carefully criticised by the teachers. In the half- 
course prescribed for Sophomores, lectures are given 
on Exposition, Argument, Description, and Narra- 
tion ; and during the year the students write twelve 
themes, of from five hundred to a thousand words. 
These are carefully criticised by teachers, and gen- 
erally rewritten by the students, with this criticism 
in mind. In the half-course prescribed for Juniors 



132 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



there are lectures on Argument ; and the students 
make one formal analysis of a masterpiece of argu- 
mentative composition, and write four arguments 
known as " f orensics " of from a thousand to fif- 
teen hundred words. Each of these is preceded by 
a brief, which is criticised by a teacher before the 
forensic is written. The forensics themselves are 
also carefully criticised, and frequently rewritten. 
All teachers engaged in these courses keep frequent 
office hours for personal conference with their pupils. 

Apart from these courses, all the work in English 
at Harvard is elective. This year the English pre- 
scribed for Freshmen is divided into three distinct 
courses, somewhat differing in detail. This leaves 
six elective courses and fifteen elective half-courses 
to be accounted for. Of these, only one an ele- 
mentary half-course in Anglo-Saxon can be called 
purely linguistic. Three courses and five half- 
courses may be described as both linguistic and lit- 
erary. These deal with various specimens of En- 
glish literature from Beowulf to Milton, in each 
case attending both to the literary meaning of the 
matter in hand and to grammatical details in the 
broadest sense of the term. One full course and 
five half-courses may be described as literary, de- 
manding a great amount of reading and critical 
work, but paying no attention to linguistic detail. 
These deal with various periods of English Litera- 
ture, from the Sixteenth Century to the present 
tune. In the broader sense of the term, all these 
courses linguistic and literary alike may be called 
philological. Of the remaining work, two courses 
and two half-courses are in English Composition ; 
one half-course is in Elocution ; and one consists of 
oral discussion of topics in history and economics. 

There is no sharp distinction, then, between lit- 
erary courses and linguistic. In the past, however, 
the faculty has held that a full course should gener- 
ally involve some linguistic study. The single full 
course given this year in literature apart from lin- 
guistics is a division of a very advanced one in 
special research. Of the teachers, one professor, 
one assistant professor, and one instructor concern 
themselves wholly with the work classified as both 
literary and linguistic. All the remaining teachers 
concern themselves more or less with Composition, 
either prescribed or elective. The courses in liter- 
ature apart from linguistics are this year in charge 
of four of these teachers one professor, one assist- 
ant professor, and two instnictors. 

Last year the largest elective courses were in 
Composition, when the most elementary numbered 
154, and the next 148. The largest course among 
those both linguistic and literary was one in Shake- 
speare, which numbered 111 ; the largest half- 
course in literature, which dealt with the Eighteenth 
Century, numbered 122. In general, the courses deal- 
ing either linguistically or otherwise with the earlier 
periods of English Literature were small and mature. 
One, which dealt with Early English Metrical Ro- 
mances, numbered only six, all graduate students. 



In the courses in Composition, prescribed and 
elective alike, little importance is attached to theo- 
retical knowledge of rhetoric as distinguished from 
constant practice in writing under the most minute 
practicable criticism. In the two full elective courses 
given this year, the students write both daily themes 
of about a hundred words, and fortnightly themes 
of from five hundred to a thousand words. This 
work is frequently discussed in person with the teach- 
ers, who for this purpose keep office hours,- quite 
distinct from regular class-room appointments, 
averaging five hours a week. It will be seen, then, 
that the use of text-books, as distinguished from 
personal instruction, is reduced to a minimum. The 
text-books actually in use have been written for the 
purposes in hand by the teachers who use them. 

Of the courses in linguistics and in literature 
alike it may be said that no text-books are generally 
used. In linguistics the student must naturally 
provide himself with a good standard copy of the 
text under consideration ; but the better part of the 
comments on these texts is supplied by the actual 
teachers. In literature the student is always sent 
directly to the works of the writers under considera- 
tion. Of these he is often required to read so much 
as to make the purchase of the works in question 
impracticable. In such event students commonly 
read in the college library, where as many copies 
as possible of the works under consideration are re- 
served for their use. In no course in literature is 
any regular text-book employed. 

In the matter of methods, it has long been held 
by the teachers of English at Harvard that each 
teacher's best method is his own. When a course 
is given into a man's charge, then, he is absolutely 
free to conduct it in any way he chooses. The 
natural result is such wide divergence of method in 
detail that no valuable generalization concerning 
such detail can be made. One man finds recita- 
tions useful, generally interspersed with frequent 
comment ; another lectures ; a third prefers per- 
sonal conference ; a fourth finds the best results 
coming from properly directed discussions of special 
topics by his class, and so on. Furthermore, in 
certain cases, the methods of the same teacher may 
greatly vary with different classes and at different 
times. On only two points, perhaps, may definite 
agreement among the teachers be asserted : the first 
is that a candidate for honors in English, in addition 
to very high proficiency in six elective courses, ought 
to know at least the elements of Anglo-Saxon, ought 
to have made some study of pure literature, and 
ought to write respectably; the second is that the 
best educational results are attainable by such free 
and mutually cordial efforts of teachers differing 
widely in attainment and temperament as we at 
present enjoy. 

It may be added that the Secretary of Harvard 
University will gladly send to any applicant a pam- 
phlet describing in detail our courses in English ; 
and that any teacher of English at Harvard will

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE "PURE SAXON" OF BURNS'S "COTTER." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his article on Transplanted Genius," page 72 of 
THE DIAL for February 1, Mr. S. R. Elliott writes: 

" Certain critics have assumed that Burns was a poet who 
could write in two languages, and was not, therefore, limited 
to his original field ; and they assume this because the same 
hand that drew the masterpiece ' Tam-o-Shanter ' was also 
responsible for one of the sweetest idyls in the English lan- 
guage, 'The Cotter's Saturday Night,' written in the purest 
Saxon and in the Spenserian stanza. But ah ! it was the same 
Bobby Burns writing of the same people, and trying to show, 
for once, that his pathos needed no dialect to give verisimili- 
tude. The scenes he describes are everywhere familiar to his 
boyhood and throughout his brief manhood ; in short, he never 
wrote save of what he knew too well." 

The pure Saxon " of The Cotter's Saturday Night " 
is to be found in the dedication, which fills the first 
stanza, in the reflections that fill stanzas nine and ten, 
and in the concluding stanzas. The body of the poem, 
the description of the cotter and of his family, begins 
with the second stanza, which reads: 

" November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh ; 
The short'ning winter day is near a close ; 
The miry beasts retreating f rae the plough ; 
The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose : 
The toil-worn Cotter frae his labor goes." 
This is very far from being "pure Saxon." If, as 
some have been wont to assert, the passages composed 
in pure English are decidedly inferior to the others, the 
poem furnishes an instance in confirmation of Mr. El- 
liott's thesis. It shows that, to do his best, Burns must 
needs use his mother-tongue, as well as handle familiar 
subjects. This makes Mr. Elliott's paragraph the more 
inexplicable. A c BARROWS

In reading this morning of the burning of the Colon-

tion on the adjacent obelisk was thereby removed from 
the public gaze. Here follows the interesting text:

EDWIN BOOTH IN BERLIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In Mr. Bispham's deeply-interesting selections from 
Mr. ^Booth's letters, published in the December " Cent- 
ury," he refers to the great actor's " meager account of 
his German experiences." I was in Leipzig during the 
winter of 1882-3, and can testify to the wonderful 
enthusiasm his acting created wherever he went." In 
my diary for that winter, under date of January 13, 
1883, I find the following entry: 

'' It is a little odd to American eyes to see, in the 
amusement columns of the Berlin newspapers, adver- 
tisements setting forth that 'Mr. Edwin Booth, the 
American tragedian ' is playing Hamlet ' at the Resid- 
enz Theater. But that is just what he is doing; and 
winning a gratifying triumph. The opening performance 
of his two weeks' engagement took place last Wednes- 
day evening, and was attended by a large and bril- 
liant audience. The American colony was out in full 
force, with Minister Sargent and Mrs. Sargent at the 
head. The Crown Prince was also present, and remained 
until after the scene with Ophelia, when he withdrew, 
expressing to the manager his regret at not being able 
to see the rest of a performance which had given him 
such intense pleasure.' But he made it up by coming 
the next evening and sitting out the play. 

" Mr. Booth's conception and rendition of Hamlet ' 
(a play, be it remembered, by no means unfamiliar to 
German audiences) have completely captured the critics 
and the critical public in Berlin. He was repeatedly 
recalled during the progress of the play; at the close of 
the performance he had to appear four times and ac- 
knowledge the enthusiastic greetings. As for the press, 
it is unanimous in its praise. The Norddeutscher Zeitung 
says : Mr. Booth's Hamlet is a creation of flesh and blood ; 
not such as we have been accustomed to in Germany. 
What he did last night was sufficient to show that he is 
fully entitled to the great reputation which has pre- 
ceded him. The noblesse and retiring modesty with 
which he received all manifestations of favor made a 
winning impression.' His repertoire, I hear, will be en- 
tirely Shakespearian. He had thought of having ' Riche- 
lieu ' translated, but has been dissuaded therefrom by 
his friend Friedrich Haase, who convinced him that it 
would be a mistake." JogIAH R g MITH

LOWELL'S "BAFFLED DECUMAN." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The reference by your correspondent (DlAL, Feb. 16, 
p. 103) to Lowell's use of the word decuman in his poem 
" The Cathedral," and the puzzlement of his critics on 
its first appearance twenty years ago, has brought to 
mind a paragraph in the facetiee department of a prom- 
inent periodical of that time, which might have amused 
Mr. Lowell as a curiosity of criticism, and as such may 
be worth reprinting: 

"The other evening, in returning home, what time 
our streets and sidewalks were glare with ice, we ob- 
served a chap endeavoring to scale an inclined plane, 
and at the same time he gave evidences of an uneasy 
stomach. Hailing him, we asked, ' What are you about ? ' 
Whereto he replied, in the language of Lowell, 

'Spume-sliding down the baffled decuman.' 
He evidently was the first to interpret the line ! "

Ax EARNEST 



It is a dozen years since Arthur Penrhyn 
Stanley, much loved and honored, sank to rest 
in the Deanery at Westminster. His biography 
has been delayed by a series of misadventures. 
His closest friend, Hugh Pearson, who might 
have written it, followed Stanley within a 
twelvemonth. His travelling companion and 
frequent co-worker, Sir George Grove, found 
the pressure of other duties incompatible with 
the task which the Dean had hoped that he 
would undertake. Mr. Walrond, to whom the 
work fell, died while arranging and assimilat- 
ing his superabundant materials. Dean Brad- 
ley began a Life on so prodigious a scale that 
he was compelled to abandon it. Finally, Mr. 
Rowland Prothero was put in possession of 
Dean Bradley's notes and Dean Stanley's pa- 
pers, with the result which lies before us. It 
proves well worth waiting for. At first one is 
tempted to suspect that less space might have 
been occupied. The humors of the Tractarian 
controversy on both sides of it have had un- 
usual publicity, and may fairly be considered 
to be exhausted. Mr. Prothero's comments 
upon Stanley's career, elucidative and sympa- 
thetic as they are, might sometimes be short- 
ened. A smaller number of Stanley's letters 
might have as clearly revealed his delightful 
personality. A reviewer must find fault some- 
where, and so it may be said that the board 
sometimes groans under the profusion of the 
banquet. That may be taken for an official 
judgment. But personally the critic has read 
and rejoiced in every page from title to finis, 
and holds with the French gourmand who said 
" Too much is not enough." 

It is curious that Stanley, living and dead, 
should have had almost the first and almost 
the last word in the long debate between Tract- 
arianism and Broad Churchmanship, between 
the men who looked backward and those who 
looked forward for the golden age of the Church. 
Half a century ago the premature death of Dr. 
Arnold gave his favorite pupil an opportunity 
to choose his part and impress his master's mind 
on the more earnest and thoughtful spirits of 
the generation which to-day has nearly passed

from the stage. The fifty years are ended, and 
it is a life of Arnold's biographer which sums 
up the gains and losses of the long campaign. 
To be sure, there remains a Memorial of Jow- 
ett to be written, and Pusey's Life is incom- 
plete. But we know from the volumes already 
issued what Dr. Pusey's Life is likely, and un- 
likely, to give us ; and Dr. Jowett, as scholar 
and educator rather than ecclesiastic or theo- 
logian, has been on a side-track rather than the 
main line. But Stanley all his days was in the 
thick of everything. Whatever the event or 
spectacle of his period, he was either on the 
stage as an actor, or an eager participant as 
spectator in the front row of seats. 

Born in the highest ranks of English society, 
the son of a clergyman who was to become 
Bishop of Norwich in Stanley's early youth, 
from the first Arthur Stanley was an unusual 
child, of a highly nervous organization and an 
almost feminine sweetness of nature. He was 
known at home as "the little sylph " and "Prince 
Pitiful." Sent to a private school at nine years 
old, his heart was in his books rather than his 
play. He read Southey and Dryden and Shake- 
speare and Plutarch, from copies bought with 
his pocket-money. He wrote odes to 

" The humming-bird bright, 
The screech-owl of the night, 
And the stork snow-white." 

He " screamed with rapture " at the first sight 
of big waves at sea, and fairly " danced in 
ecstasy " at the vision of a mountain peak above 
the clouds. He had an early reputation as a 
teller of stories, and the gift probably stood 
him in good stead when he entered Rugby, a 
slim and delicate boy, at the age of thirteen. 
Dr. Arnold had just been made Head-Master, 
and Arthur came at once under his influence. 
A word from one of Stanley's schoolmates sug- 
gests the secret of Arnold's gift as an in- 
structor. 

" "What struck me was the way in which Arnold re- 
ferred to ' the upper boys ' on matters of criticism, or 
points of history. ' Stanley, what do you think about 
that ? ' ' Vaughan, how would you construe that ? ' fold- 
ing his gown and leaning upon the table and looking 
towards them with such respect, shown in the very tones 
of his voice." 

Happy in such a teacher, Arthur quickly rose 
in the ranks of the school ; prize after prize fell 
into his hands ; and when, having won the Bal- 
liol scholarship, he came up for his last award 
for Greek verses, he had the delight of hear- 
ing from his revered master's lips : " Stanley, 
I have now given you from this place every 
prize that can be given, and I cannot let it

pass without thanking you for the honor you 
have reflected upon the school." The tone of 
unfeigned " respect " is very audible. Masters 
like Arnold are very apt to secure pupils like 
Stanley. 

Before going to Oxford, Stanley visited Ar- 
nold at Allan Bank, and the Hares, his kins- 
folk, at Hurstmonceaux. He saw Wordsworth, 
an old man, rather untidily dressed, with a face 
of great mildness, who talked of trees and 
shrubs, told merry stories, was not dictatorial, 
and did not engross the conversation. He 
saw John Sterling, and heard him preach, "very 
fine, the next best to Arnold." He read Cole- 
ridge's " Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit," 
still in manuscript, and judged its merits and 
defects very wisely. He heard read aloud some 
verses from a fledgeling poet, just flayed by the 
"Quarterly," Alfred Tennyson. He caught 
the reforming temper of his hosts at Hurst- 
monceaux, and wrote to Vaughan : 

" Alas, that a church that has so divine a service should 
keep its long list of Articles. I am strengthened more 
than ever in my opinion that there is only needed, that 
there only should be, one, viz., < I believe that Christ is 
both God and Man.' " 

That was the mood of Arthur Stanley always. 
On that brief platform he was ready to stand 
with all believers. 

It was in October, 1834, that he went up to 
Oxford. The first Sunday he heard Dr. Pusey 
upon the Song of Solomon. " It was very long 
and disproportioned ; most of it learned and 
clever." The length and the learning and the 
disproportion are all quite credible. Pusey 
was already a recognized leader. The Tract- 
arian movement had begun, and the more earn- 
est minds of the University were mainly drawn 
to it. It attracted Stanley, who respected 
Pusey, loved to quote Keble, and admired New- 
man. The spell of Arnold was no longer as 
dominating as it had been. Stanley was grow- 
ing in independence, beginning to measure and 
judge those whom most profoundly he rever- 
enced. He could disapprove of the temper of 
Arnold's fierce diatribe upon " The Oxford 
Malignants." He was becoming less a student 
of books, more an observer of men. For this 
reason, perhaps, his university career was less 
brilliant than that at Rugby had been. It was 
only on the third trial that he won the Ireland 
scholarship, though he took his " first-class " 
and gained a fellowship, not in his own college. 
It had been hinted to him that his opinions 
were under suspicion, and that failure there 
was probable. He was at this time in " a strait 



betwixt two " as to his theological position. He 
was drawn to Newman, he was still held by Ar- 
nold. " A magnificent and consistent system " 
of Sacramentarian teaching appealed to his 
imagination and historic sense, while " the voice 
of St. Paul's Epistles " called him, " loud and 
clear," in the opposite direction. The struggle 
was brief and decisive. The earliest fathers 
once for all triumphed over any later authori- 
ties. A Tory and High Churchman by his 
nerves, his affections, his sympathies, Stanley 
was a liberal in Church and State by virtue of 
his reason and conscience. When his feelings 
led one way and his sober judgment another, 
Stanley knew where to go, however painful the 
wrench of the decision. But finding, as he said 
a little later, the character of the Liberals 
" miserably unsatisfactory," and " to act with 
the Newmanites impossible," he struck across 
country for himself, and from the hour of Ar- 
nold's death called no man master. That death 
occurred in June, 1842. Stunned by the aw- 
ful shock at first, Stanley roused himself to 
comfort the desolated household. Presently, 
at their request, he threw himself heart and soul 
into the work of preparing Arnold's biography. 
To be entrusted with it had been a dream of 
his boyhood. He entered on his task with a 
fine prescience as to what the record of such a 
life might be. For two years, his toil was great, 
almost " an agony." The result was adequate. 
He produced one of the half-dozen best biog- 
raphies in the English tongue. It is singularly 
free from the faults of an unpractised writer. 
It is more reserved and sober in style than any 
of Stanley's after works. Its author was not 
yet thirty years old. 

Meanwhile, after some scruples as to the 
damnatory clauses of the Athanasian creed and 
the strictness of clerical subscription, Stan- 
ley had been ordained deacon and priest, and 
appointed college lecturer and tutor at Oxford. 
The atmosphere of the University was at this 
time dense with storm and overcharged with 
electricity. The fall of the Whigs, the issue 
of " Tract No. 90," the suspension of Dr. Pusey, 
the publication of Ward's " Ideal Church," the 
degradation from his doctorate of its author, 
the stir about Hampden's lectures, the volcanic 
eruption of party spirit on his nomination to 
the See of Hereford, the lapsing of Ward and of 
Newman to Rome, made the life of an Oxford 
fellow at this period a series of shocks and 
jars and surprises, most uncongenial to Stan- 
ley's pacific temperament. Yet, for all his love 
of peace, he would not slink out of the field of 



136

contest where only sure and lasting peace was 
to be won. He was a chivalric champion of 
most diverse causes. Show him a victim of 
injustice anywhere, forthwith, sword in hand, 
though with olive-branch always waving upon 
his crest, he would spring to his rescue. He 
stood by Ward and Pusey as gallantly as he 
stood by Arnold and Hampden. His foes were 
never men, but falsehoods and cruelties and 
wrongs in whatever armor. Always he held 
with those who sought for the widest liberty 
and the most generous inclusiveness. He would 
ever strive to make the visible and the invisible 
Church coterminous. As much as might be, he 
passed out of the arena of controversy and 
busied himself with his books and his pupils. 
He knew how to make the page of his text- 
book " glow with the light of wisdom and po- 
etry." The charm of his teaching was " sim- 
ply irresistible." He gave his students " his 
heart and his best gifts," as well as large pe- 
cuniary aid, freely and delicately bestowed upon 
those who needed it. It is curious to know 
that the ready and copious writer of after-years 
at this time shrank from sermonizing, declaring 
that he " could see his way to twelve sermons 
and no more." He had not yet discovered, as 
a naive student once said, " what a surprising 
number of good texts there are in the Bible ! " 
His flow was a little checked, perhaps, by feel- 
ing himself under suspicion from a clerical gen- 
eration which dreaded German theology in the 
lump and knew no distinction between Strauss 
and Ewald. There are men to-day who draw 
no line between Voltaire and Renan. .For his 
own part, Stanley was " fearless, and could af- 
ford to be bold." Assuming no party badge, 
uttering no clamorous war-cry, fighting with 
his own sling and stone, he found few to stand 
beside him. Detesting, as Arnold did and 
Paul did, the spirit of party, there was danger 
that he might become " a bigot against intol- 
erance." Mr. Prothero says that he did ; but 
the epigram is not quite just. Stanley would 
allow no diversities of temper or opinion to 
sever him from anyone who followed Christ, as 
the Way, the Truth, and the Life. When 
Dr. Liddon and Dr. Pusey would hardly own 
that Maurice and Jowett and Stanley were dis- 
ciples of their Christ, still Stanley urgently of- 
fered them the pulpit of the Abbey to freely 
preach their Gospel. His charity could span 
all chasms of opinion. He had no doubt that 
truth would prevail. 

In 1849 Bishop Stanley died, sincerely 
mourned throughout his diocese. His son had 



learned to honor a father with whom he had 
not overmuch in common. " The crash, the 
gloom, the uprooting, and the void " left by the 
death were at first overwhelming. Stanley for 
a season was driven forth from his books into 
practical business cares for his mother and sis- 
ters in the breaking up of their home, and 
learned " to sympathize more than ever before 
with the working part of the world in every- 
day life." The burden soon grew heavier. 
Within three months both his brothers died, 
and, succeeding to the small family estate, he 
could no longer hold his fellowship. He had 
just declined the deanery at Carlisle. He was 
presently glad to accept the post of Canon at 
Canterbury, and make his home there for half 
a dozen years. 

Before this, all England was shaken with the 
Gorham controversy. For Stanley it was not 
a question of the meaning of baptism, but of 
the right of his clerical brethren to resist a test 
imposed by a Bishop without color of law, and 
the larger question still, should the English 
Church be rent and a large body of its devoted 
clergy be driven forth from it. He took his ar- 
dent part in the struggle, fighting, as always, 
for what he believed to be liberty and peace. 
But he recognized that " no man ever threw 
himself into controversy without regretting the 
plunge." " I have had some misgivings," he 
wrote, "about my article [in the " Edinburgh"] . 
I fear St. John would hardly have approved of 
it " ; and " I am a real St. John's man,'' he 
might have added, in the words of our own 
Muhlenburg. Yet St. John was at times nota- 
bly plain of speech. There are junctures when 
charity does not forbid even an apostle to say 
"thou fool" or "this is the deceiver and the 
antichrist." Stanley's conscience was a sensi- 
tive organ. How droll his scruples must seem 
to some modern hammerers of heresy, who, shar- 
ing the temper of the Puritans without their 
convictions, are ready to hew Agag in pieces 
before the Lord, in the columns of church 
newspapers ! So intense is their zeal for the 
inspiration of the Bible that they even trans- 
mute its warnings into examples, and when it 
says, as in the ninth commandment for exam- 
ple, " Thou shalt not," reply thankfully " I will, 
Lord." It were not strange if Stanley's gen- 
tle tolerance should supply them a fresh occa- 
sion to blaspheme. 

From this time on, Stanley's life at Can- 
terbury from 1851 to 1857, at Oxford as Pro- 
fessor of Ecclesiastical History until 1863, and 
for the eighteen years that followed at West-

minster, was mainly that of the ardent stu- 
dent and brilliant writer of Church History. 
There were frequent episodes of travel, there 
were dashes into the arena of Convocation, there 
were the diversions of society. He accom- 
panied the Prince of Wales to Egypt and Pal- 
estine. He married the Duke of Edinburgh 
in the Imperial Chapel at St. Petersburg. He 
visited America, and was the guest of Phil- 
lips Brooks. But mainly he was scholar and 
author. Having written the best religious biog- 
raphy in our language, he proceeded to write 
brilliant volumes upon Canterbury as its Canon 
and upon Westminster as its Dean. He wrote 
the best volume extant in English upon Sinai 
and Palestine. He wrote luminous lectures 
on the Eastern Church and the Scottish Church, 
and traced the whole course of Hebrew history 
from Abraham to the Maccabees, treading in 
Ewald's steps and anticipating some of Kenan's 
conclusions. He made the Old Testament a 
living book. Men of all schools profit by his 
labors. His volumes, with their clear, rich, 
flowing style, and wealth of illustration, have 
become classics. Everybody helps himself to 
their contents without shame, knowing that 
the theft will be recognized, condoned, and im- 
itated. Those who regard their author as anath- 
ema still illuminate their sermons with his 
glowing descriptions, and pay unwilling tribute 
to his fame. 

For a few years the Dean's life at West- 
minster was brightened by a late but most for- 
tunate marriage. Then the brief blessing was 
withdrawn, and Stanley, the lonelier for the 
experience of a perfect companionship, lived 
on and labored on, somewhat wearily. Loving 
friends ministered to him. Travel and society 
more or less dulled his pain. It was after his 
wife's death that he visited this country, and 
found a tonic influence in (what Bryce noted 
afterwards) the special hopefulness of Amer- 
ican life. But his work was done. The causes 
he had championed had won their way. Men 
spoke their thought with freedom and were 
tolerant of differences that once had sharply 
divided them. The progress of the higher crit- 
icism had made what had been heresies received 
opinions. The Bible which he loved, the He- 
brew history which he had illuminated, were 
become more familiar and more precious for 
his labors. Their inspiration was altogether 
unimpaired, though he had brushed away the 
dust and cobwebs from the covers of the sacred 
volume and recognized the existence of fly- 
specks on its ancient and precious pages. The 



Church of England was the less imperilled be- 
cause he had done his best to lift its life a little 
above the moods of party ; to interpret its 
formularies largely, in the spirit rather than 
the letter ; to draw representatives of opposed 
opinions into a bond of peace ; to free church- 
men from the overbearing weight of hard ec- 
clesiasticism ; to uphold the Living Spirit 
against spectres evoked from the darkest ages 
of Christian history ; to point courageously 
forward, not with melancholy backward, for the 
ideal of the Church. 

What a rich life it had been rich in love 
and honors, in service and reward ! The boy 
who won all hearts and all the prizes, kept on 
winning them to the end. The Queen's friend, 
the favored guest of princes, the cherished com- 
panion of scholars and men of letters, won the 
devotion of the working-men, whom he loved to 
lead through the aisles of the Abbey, interpret- 
ing as they went its monuments and descant- 
ing on its history. Did he ever make an en- 
emy ? If he did, he probably soon converted 
him into a friend. Canon Wordsworth pro- 
tested against his appointment as Dean of 
Westminster. He avenged himself by paying 
tribute in his earliest sermon to good work 
which the protesting Canon had done. His 
Chapter sometimes opposed him, but they could 
not make him quarrel with them. He respected 
their consciences, while asserting firmly the 
right of his own. 

He had his faults, like other men. He be- 
wailed his "fatal irresolution," but it only dis- 
turbed himself and his inner circle. He per- 
haps loved peace even idolatrously, and in his 
concern for charity risked seeming indifference 
to truth. He would refuse to see the great gulf 
fixed between him and those over against him, 
which narrower eyes saw very well. He too 
much identified the English Establishment with 
the Church of Christ. His ministry was more 
to the Church at large than to individual men. 
An aristocrat by temper and circumstance, he 
was more optimistic than if his lot had been less 
favorably cast. He was curiously dependent 
upon others in all his minor habitudes. There 
was a " quaint, pathetic helplessness " about 
him, half vexing, half endearing. With all 
his gentleness he was pugnacious, and thought 
peace worth seeking at the cannon's mouth. 
But he enriched the life and literature of his 
time. In all his encounters he never dodged, 
nor struck an unfair blow. He spared his en- 
emies, he championed his friends. Those who 
scarce confessed him a disciple were won by

his works, though they had been frightened by 
his words. The churches of all English speak- 
ing lands are the better for his living. The 
heresies of the hour become the orthodoxy of 
the ages. The memory of Arthur Penrhyn 
Stanley will endure and be precious so long as 
men love and value tolerance and peace. And 
some do still. c. A. L. RICHARDS. 



THE MYTHICAL, WELSH DISCOVERY or 
AMERICA. * 



f The question of the Welsh discovery of 
America has engaged the attention of the pub- 
lic more or less for the last three hundred years. 
The theory was first enunciated by Humphrey 
Lloyd, in the sixteenth century ; and since then 
there have been continually-recurring discus- 
sions of the subject, both in the native press 
of Wales and elsewhere. In the exhaustive 
bibliography prepared by Mr. Paul Barren 
Watson and published in the writer's " Amer- 
ica not Discovered by Columbus," Mr. Watson 
gives no less than fifty-one books and essays 
on " Discovery by the Welsh " ; and this list 
does not include the vast amount of literature 
on the subject which has appeared from time 
to time in Wales. 

The work of Mr. Stephens was written for 
competition at the celebrated Llangollen Eis- 
teddfod, held on September 21, 1858, and the 
three following days. The subject for compe- 
tition was announced in these terms : " For the 
best essay upon the Discovery of America in 
the twelfth century by Prince Madoc ap Owain 
Gwynedd, prize 20 and a silver star." Six 
essays were sent in, five of which assumed the 
truth of the Welsh tradition. In the remaining 
essay, under the assumed name of " Gwenerth 
Engydlym," Mr. Stephens, after presenting an 
almost exhaustive summary of the literature of 
the subject, and marshalling all the evidence 
usually cited for and against the Cambrian 
story, subjected them to a rigid criticism, and 
finally declared himself a disbeliever in the tale, 

" How Madoc from the shores of Britain spread 
The adventurous sail." 

It is this essay which is now given to the pub- 
lic in a sumptuous volume. The Eisteddfod 
committee to award the prize being aware of 
the existence of this negative essay, decided 
that, it being not on the Discovery but on the

AP OWEN GWINEDD, in the Twelfth Century. By Thomas 
Stephens. Edited by Llywarch Reynolds. New York : Long- 
mans, Green, & Co. 



Non-discovery of America by Madoc, it was 
not on the given subject, and must therefore 
be excluded from the competition. This led to 
a bitter contest, the echoes of which are still 
reverberating in the world's press. The most 
competent member of the committee, the dis- 
tinguished scholar Silvan Evans, resigned, and 
disgraceful scenes took place at the Eisteddfod. 
The fourth centenary celebration in honor of 
Columbus seemed an opportune time for giving 
the manuscript of Mr. Stephens to the public ; 
and this has been done through the capable ed- 
itorship of Mr. Llywarch Reynolds, the author 
having carefully revised the work before his 
death. 

The book is divided into three parts, the 
first presenting all the literature of the subject, 
and leaving the statements, without note or 
comment, to make their own impression on the 
reader ; the second passing in review the opin- 
ions of the various writers who have treated the 
subject pro and con, and thus exhibiting the 
impressions produced by the facts upon other 
minds ; and the third giving a critical discus- 
sion of the whole subject by the author. By 
this method there is of course involved no lit- 
tle diffuseness, the same facts being marshalled 
for three different purposes ; but the result is 
that the subject is discussed in all its bearings, 
and the treatment made absolutely exhaustive. 

A personal reference at this point may be per- 
mitted. In 1874, when 1 prepared my little 
book on the Norse disco vei*y of America in the 
tenth and eleventh centuries, I had examined, 
though rather superficially, some of the writers 
who held the discovery of Madoc to be a dem- 
onstrated fact ; and while I had no means of 
making a thorough study of ' the question, I 
came to look upon the Welsh claim as not only 
possible but even probable, and accordingly 
stated in that work that " It is generally be- 
lieved, and not without reason, that the ances- 
tors of the Welsh, under the leadership of 
Madoc, made a settlement in this country about 
the year 1170." But after reading Mr. Ste- 
phens's exhaustive work, with its overwhelming 
weight of argument, I am bound to revise my 
former opinion, and to say that he has not left 
a single shred of supposed evidence unrefuted. 
I believe no candid reader can rise from the 
perusal of " Madoc " with any other impression 
than that the story is not founded on facts. 
The supposed discovery is not an historic nar- 
rative, but merely a legend which has had its 
day and must henceforth be put in its proper 
place in the list with the Welsh " Mabinogion."

The Welsh, on whose minds the Madoc story 
has taken a firm hold and has had all the force of 
a patriotic sentiment, should not regret that it 
has at length been effectually relegated to the 
domain of fiction. Mr. Stephens's work, with all 
its iconoclasm, shows that the Welsh race pos- 
sesses men capable of self-analysis and histor- 
ical criticism. And, indeed, the Welsh have 
an abundance of other things of which they may 
well be proud. They speak one of the parent 
languages of the world, a language which holds 
an enviable position in comparative philology. 
They have an ancient literature, which scholars 
in every land are translating and illustrating. 
They have an honorable history, much of which 
yet lies hid in bardic materials. The Welsh 
furnished the Norman Trouveres with the ma- 
terial for the Arthurian and British romances. 
Spenser found among the Welsh the materials 
for "The Faerie Queen"; and without Welsh 
traditions Shakespeare could not have written 
his immortal " Lear " or " Cymbeline." While 
Welshmen can lay no claim to the glories and 
renown that belong to Leif Erikson and Co- 
lumbus as discoverers of America, they have 
secured many a place of honor in the annals of 
the United States. The clinging to the Madoc 
legend in the future can only tend to lower 
Welshmen's reputation as truthful men, and 
thus injure their credit as a people of sterling 
worth. Mr. Stephens's verdict must be ac- 
cepted as final. RASMUS B. ANDERSON. 



REMBRANDT AGAIN.* 



The oft-told story of Agassiz reconstructing 
the skeleton of a rare fish from one small bone 
brought to him by a fisherman, is applicable 
to the new life of Rembrandt by Emile Michel. 
There are only one or two bones in the whole 
life of Eembrandt, but M. Michel has made a 
complete skeleton from them, and not only put 
blood and brains into it, but has clothed it with 
moral, social, and religious qualities. Unfor- 
tunately, M. Michel's historic method is not so 
satisfying as Agassiz's scientific method ; and 
the reader may indulge in some doubts about 
the basic statements which start as guesses and 
finally end up as un controverted facts. 

" Perhaps " Rembrandt learned a great deal 
about Bible story from his mother's knee ; but

Emile Michel. From the French by Florence Simmonds.

because he painted his mother with a Bible in 
her hand, in lieu of some other book, is not 
sufficient proof to warrant any such inference, 
or to account for the fact that Rembrandt so 
often painted Bible stories in his pictures. 
Would M. Michel argue that all painters who 
painted religious pictures were " pious brought 
up " at their mothers' knee, we wonder? And 
if the argument hold good, why was not Rem- 
brandt's mother a pagan Greek teaching Greek 
mythology to her son, since he painted myth- 
ological as well as Biblical subjects ? There 
are a great string of these " perhapses " and 
" probablys" running through the first volume, 
which are interesting enough as speculations, 
but the pity of them is that the next writer 
of a Rembrandt life will put them down as ab- 
solute facts, and in a few years we shall have 
a house-of-cards history of Rembrandt that will 
eventually have to be knocked down just as M. 
Michel has knocked down the Rembrandt his- 
tories of the past. That is the way history and 
biography are made, and it accounts very well 
for the continual re-making that has been go- 
ing on since the world began. 

And, after all, what is the use of all this 
study into the minutiae of a life like Rem- 
brandt's ? People are interested in him as a 
painter, not a man of the world. His was not 
a life of action, or of any great social or polit- 
ical importance. He was not a Napoleon, a 
Mirabeau, or even a romantic Anton ello da 
Messina, or a travelled Rubens. His life was 
quiet, sedate, and thoroughly Dutch, not dif- 
fering essentially from that of his contempo- 
raries. Born of middle-class parents, at Ley- 
den, in 1606, he was the fifth of six children. 
We know nothing of his boyhood, and little 
more of his education. He was sent to the uni- 
versity, but at fifteen he had decided to become 
a painter and was a pupil of Swanenburch. In 
1624 he went to Amsterdam, and for about six 
months was a pupil of Lastman. This ended his 
apprenticeship at painting ; and as for his skill 
as an etcher, no one knows who taught it to 
him or whether he just picked it up through 
native genius. He returned to Leyden, estab- 
lished himself as an independent artist, and 
soon rose to fame, money, and some pupils. 
Then, in 1631, he went back to Amsterdam, 
to live there permanently and to become the 
people's painter of the time. In 1634 he mar- 
ried Saskia van Uylenborch, a young woman 
of better family and more money than he pos- 
sessed, with whom he lived happily up to the 
time of her death. In 1639 he bought, and

fitted up with many objects of art, the much- 
talked-about house in the Breestraat. He was 
then at the height of his fame, making money 
and spending it lavishly, devoted to his art and 
his wife, and to all appearance serenely happy. 
In 1642 Saskia died, leaving Rembrandt a year- 
old son, Titus, and the bulk of her property, 
which was considerable. From that time began 
the decline of his fame and his prosperity, but 
not of his art. He worked on in the Breestraat 
house, and took for a mistress and model his 
house-servant, Hendrickje Stoffels. Careless- 
ness and extravagance in money matters fol- 
lowed, and in 1656 he was declared a bank- 
rupt and sold out of house and home the art 
collections going for a song to the Jews and 
hawkers. He then wandered from pillar to 
post about Amsterdam, domiciled in various 
places, and protected from his creditors in a 
measure by the efforts of Titus and Hendrickje. 
About 1664 Hendrickje died, and in 1668 Ti- 
tus too passed away. The painter, outclassed 
in popular esteem by the peddling little men of 
the paint-brush who had arisen, steeped in pov- 
erty and comparative obscurity, aged and quite 
forsaken, at last gave up the struggle and died 
in 1669. 

Such are the bare facts of a commonplace 
life ; and the only thing that makes them at 
all interesting to us is that this life was led by 
one of the greatest painters of any time or 
country. Undoubtedly his sorrows and trials 
had their effect upon his art, for he was a man 
of much feeling, and herein lies the answer 
to our previous question and the chief value of 
M. Michel's extensive researches. He has fol- 
lowed chronologically Rembrandt's life and 
work, showing his varying styles of art and 
their probable origin in the varying circum- 
stances of his life. Some of this is strained in 
inference to the breaking point, and still more 
is mere over-subtile conjecture ; but it is read- 
able, and often suggestive. There is. matter 
more pertinent in the discussion of dates, and 
attributions, and all that, because M. Michel 
had the pictures to work from. Besides this, 
the author has brought together an exhaustive 
mass of shrewd criticism reviewing every im- 
portant work that Rembrandt ever etched or 
painted, and illuminating it not only by the 
text, but by a vast number of plates and repro- 
ductions. Probably no one was better qualified 
to do this work than M. Michel. He was in 
perfect sympathy with his subject before he 
began to write, had studied it for years, was 
surrounded and saturated with Rembrandt's 



art, and from the art drew the character of the 
man. If his sympathy has sometimes made 
him a partisan, it is not to be wondered at, since 
his cause was a good one. 

For Rembrandt was a remarkable man in 
the annals of art, a superb etcher and a su- 
preme painter, whose like it is not probable we 
shall see again. Primarily he was a portrait 
painter. The single figure was more consonant 
with his art-methods than the composed group. 
That was probably due to several causes. He 
was no lover of the traditional or academic, 
and never followed school formulae in compo- 
sition to any extent. His composition was his 
own, and it was sometimes good and sometimes 
bad. He had not a particle of what has been 
called " style," had no care for line as line, and 
was uniquely individual in the picturesque* 
With peculiar methods that became dominant 
in his art and were opposed to classic compo- 
sition, he often distorted lights and shadows, 
and built up certain portions of a composition 
by dragging down other portions ; and this, 
while a forceful method of procedure with the 
single figure, as his portraits attest, was not 
perhaps the best method of handling composed 
groups, as a number of his large figure-pieces 
attest. His mastery of light-and-shade rather 
militated against his composition, just as it 
bleached and often falsified his color. Fine in 
many instances as a colorist, he was prone to 
destroy the purity and value of tones by sub- 
ordination ; and, positive as he was in hand- 
ling, he at times lapsed into heaviness and inef- 
fectual kneading. 

Mentally, he was a man keen to observe, as- 
similate, and synthesize. His conception was 
localized with his own people -and time (he 
never built up the imaginary or followed Italy), 
and yet into types taken from the streets and 
shops of Amsterdam he infused the very larg- 
est humanity through his inherent sympathy 
with man. Dramatic, even tragic, he was at 
times, and yet showed it less in vehement ac- 
tion than in passionate expression. He had a 
way of striking universal truths through the 
human face, a turned head, bent body, or out- 
stretched hand, that was powerful in the ex- 
treme. His people have great dignity and 
character, and we are made to feel that they 
are types of the Dutch race people of sub- 
stantial physique, slow in thought and impulse, 
yet capable of feeling, comprehending, enjoy- 
ing, suffering. His landscapes, again, are a 
synthesis of all Dutch landscape, a grouping 
of the great truths of light, space, and air.

Whatever he turned his mind upon was treated 
with that breadth of view that overlooks the 
little and grasps the great. He painted many 
subjects, dating from 1627 to the time of his 
death, and at first was a little sharp in detail 
and cold in coloring. After 1654 he grew much 
broader in handling and warmer in coloring ; 
tending, toward the end of his life, to rather 
hot tones. His domestic troubles served only 
to heighten and deepen his art, and perhaps 
his best canvases were painted under stress of 
circumstances and in sadness of heart. His 
life is another proof, if needed, that the great- 
est truths and beauties are to be seen only 
through tears. Too bad for the man ! but the 
world the same ungrateful, selfish world that 
has always lighted its torch at the funeral pyres 
of genius is the gainer. 

These two quartos are handsomely gotten up 
in the matter of paper, printing, and binding : 
and the upwards of three hundred illustrations 
are a mine in themselves, giving as they do the 
best of the master's work. Both as a readable 
book and as a book of reference, no Rembrandt- 
lover's library can be complete without it. Mr. 
Frederick Wedmore has edited it, and compiled 
for it several serviceable indexes, with knowl- 
edge and discrimination ; and the task of trans- 
lating from the French seems to have fallen 
into good hands. J OHN C> y AN DyKE> 



THE RELIGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES.* 



To inaugurate a series of denominational his- 
tories illustrative of the religious development 
of our country, Dr. H. K. Carroll has under- 
taken to give, in a handsome octavo volume of 
440 pages, entitled " The Religious Forces of 
the United States," some of the results of his 
investigations on behalf of the Eleventh United 
States Census. He anticipates to some extent 
the eleven volumes which are to follow his and 
give the history of twenty more or less flour- 
ishing religious denominations ; but, deriving 
his material wholly from the Census bulletins 
(not yet published), his purpose is " to describe 
and classify all denominations so as to give a 
clear idea of the character and strength of the 
religious forces of the United States." Thus 

* AMERICAN CHURCH HISTORY. VOLUME I., THE KEU- 
GIOUS FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES, Enumerated, Clas- 
sified and Described on the Basis of the Government Census 
of 1890. With an Introduction on the condition and character 
of American Christianity. By H. K. Carroll, LL.D., in charge 
of the Division of Churches, Eleventh Census. New York : 
The Christian Literature Co. 



the author and compiler sets out upon the most 
interesting portion of his volume, the introduc- 
tion, embracing fifty-two pages and divided into 
fourteen sections, wherein, after sketching the 
effort made, amid the greatest difficulties, to 
develop the ecclesiastical department of the late 
Census, he comments upon the " Variety in 
Religion," " Denominational Titles," and the 
" Causes of Division." He does this with con- 
siderable humor, though he furnishes much 
food for sober reflection for those whose minds 
are fixed upon the subject of Christian Unity. 
It is to lighten the statistician's labors by se- 
curing a scientific nomenclature, that Dr. Car- 
roll chiefly favors reunion ; and he drolly adds : 
" And why such reunion has not taken place 
in scores of instances, I cannot explain, except 
by the prevalence of the doctrine of the perse- 
verance of saints. It must be that the saints 
of the sects think they ought to persevere in 
sectarian division." 

One must needs have a well developed sense 
of humor to deal statistically, and without losing 
temper, with the difficulties presented in having 
to classify four distinct bodies of " Brethren," 
popularly known as, yet disclaiming the name 
of, " Plymouth Brethren " (who can only be 
distinguished by the Roman numerals I., II., 
III., IV.), twelve varieties of Presbyterians, 
thirteen of Baptists, and seventeen of Method- 
ists. And among them all, the only denomi- 
national title which Dr. Carroll finds to be 
really definitive is that of the " Old Two-Seed- 
in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists." By re- 
ducing the one hundred and forty-three denom- 
inations he encounters to " denominational fam- 
ilies," he still has forty-two such families on 
his hands, while we venture to assert that many 
of the members of these families would repu- 
diate the parentage he has assigned to them. 
His attempt to create a " Catholic " family to 
include the Roman Catholics, the Greek Cath- 
olics (Uniates), the Russian Orthodox, the 
Greek Orthodox, the Armenians, the Old Cath- 
olics, and the Reformed Catholics, and leaving 
out the "Protestant Episcopalians " (who daily 
assert their belief in the Holy Catholic Church, 
and frankly admit that if their church be not 
Catholic it has 110 right to exist), is a curious 
blunder. 

As might be expected, Dr. Carroll brings 
to light many religious curiosities. He includes 
in his Census Report one denomination with 
as few as twenty-five members ; and with re- 
luctance excludes one with twenty-one members, 
because unorganized, its twenty-one members

being in three different States. If the author's 
ability to maintain such absolute impartiality, 
in his dealing with the various denominations, 
as not to betray his sympathy with any partic- 
ular one, were the grounds upon which the 
Superintendent of the Eleventh Census made 
choice of Dr. Carroll to take charge of the Divi- 
sion of Churches, the choice is fully justified 
by the book before us. But there are other 
indications of the wisdom of the selection ; and 
while we await the appearance of the Census 
Report, this summary furnishes some racy as 
well as some more serious (though always en- 
tertaining and instructive) reading.

THE FRESHEST VOICE AMOXG LATIN 
POETS.* 



English students of Catullus have hitherto 
been dependent chiefly on the two learned and 
costly volumes of Mr. Robinson Ellis. For 
class-room use there has been available a se- 
verely sifted selection of the most proper verses, 
with useful notes, by Mr. F. P. Simpson, in 
the ugly little scarlet covers of Macmillan's 
Classical Series. There was a strongly-felt 
need for a complete edition of moderate size 
and agreeable form. We think Professor Mer- 
rill's work will satisfactorily fill this need. It 
is especially pleasant to welcome an edition of 
a classic, by an American scholar, which is 
neither " based on " nor translated from any 
German book. This pleasure has, unhappily, 
the added charm of extreme rarity. Mr. Mer- 
rill has also the courage of his individuality, 
and usually prefers to state his own under- 
standing of his author, rather than to compile 
from earlier editors. Further, he appreciates 
the fact that Catullus lives as a poet, and as 
such he interprets him, with sympathy and 
hearty interest. Of course the requirements 
of a school-book, and especially of a series, set 
limits to this latter quality of an editor, but it 
shines through in frequent brief comments 
and especially in the cautious reconstruction of 
Catullus's life and poetic development, which 
fills pp. xii.-xxxvi. 

It is well known that we are dependent for 
this poet upon copies of a single old MS. which 
was discovered early in the fourteenth century, 
and subsequently disappeared again. Pro- 
fessor Merrill gives (pp. 227-263) a careful 

* CATULLUS. By Elmer T. Merrill, of Wesleyan University. 
Boston : Ginn & Co. 



list of the readings in the two oldest of these 
copies, from which he evidently believes alt 
others are in turn derived. That will appar- 
ently suffice, at least for all who accept this 
theory as to the younger copies : which theory 
is, however, vigorously combatted by Mr. Ellis 
in the last edition of his work. Almost any col- 
lege student will doubtless be more than satis- 
fied with this much apparatus criticus. 

The book is, then, timely, attractive, and 
apparently by a competent hand. It is likely 
to restore Catullus to college curricula, much 
more widely than he is now read. This is a 
pleasant prospect, for his voice is far more di- 
rect, genuine, human, so to speak, than any 
other that has reached us from the Roman 
world. As has been said of him before, he 
also represents, more fully than perhaps any 
other poet, what youth can accomplish and 
what it cannot. He arouses in almost every 
youthful reader a feeling which the other Latin 
poets rarely call forth : enthusiastic sympathy. 
All this gives us the better right to qualify 
our welcome with frank criticism of certain 
minor details. 

We find no statement at all of the relation of 
this edition to its predecessors. But Ellis, in 
particular, like Mayor for Juvenal and Munro 
for Lucretius, has so preempted Catullus in 
a monumental work, that an English editor 
should at least either acknowledge a heavy in- 
debtedness, or claim independence in explicit 
words. There are valuable German investi- 
gations (like those of Schwabe) which Pro- 
fessor Merrill undoubtedly utilized largely, and 
also useful school editions (by Riese and others) 
which he should have consulted. If this silence 
is a rule of the series, so much the worse. 

Certain qualities of Catullus his audacity, 
his fiery rebelliousness against authorities and 
dignitaries, his irrepressible sense of the gro- 
tesque, his fury in love and hate, are so om- 
nipresent that no poem, no line, can be safely 
interpreted where they are left out of the ac- 
count. Few among our expounders of the 
classics are fitted by age and temper to appre- 
ciate such qualities fully. Perhaps Professor 
Merrill does not always give them due weight. 
Thus, on the famous poem of seven lines de- 
voted to Marcus Cicero (c. 49), we are told 
with full assurance : " It is, however, mistak- 
enly understood by many critics to be iron- 
ical in tone." We venture to assert that every 
wide-awake lad who reads those seven verses, 
or has ever read them, joins in the grin they 
were meant to call forth. 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



143 



And first, a priori. Did Catullus ever else- 
where show respect, simple and sincere respect, 
to anyone ? To the greatest generals and po- 
litical powers e. g., Pompey and Caesar ? The 
terrible scars left by the verses of No. 29 are 
the answer. Or to his dearest friends and 
to himself ? The foul and extravagant figures 
of 28 lie close at hand. To the woman that 
had dominated his life? Here it is surely 
needless to quote. " Odi et amo" he could 
say, if ever any soul incarnated might. The 
meaning of tc Diligo " he never learned. What 
father can read without something like disgust, 
remembering what the loves of Catullus and 
Clodia had really been, his worse than auda- 
cious words : 

" Then my regard for thee 
Was such as is a father's for his sons ! " 

That Catullus's poems were circulated when 
written, can be proved, if need be, from Sue- 
tonius's statement : " Caesar, conscious that he 
was himself indelibly branded by the verses," 
etc. The " catchy " heudecasyllables of the 
audacious young Provincial were surely laughed 
over in clubs, if not set to music and sung in 
the streets. Thus the poem No. 21 has no 
other purpose than to call down ridicule upon 
a rival in love : 

" Aurelius, sire of starvelings thou, 
Nor only those existing now, 
Of all who lived in ages gone, 
Or shall until the years are done." 

(The rest is abusive words which our speech 
cannot render.) Shortly after, in a brief poem 
to the young Juventius, over whose charms the 
quarrel with Aurelius had arisen, he repeats 
the refrain : 

" Of all Juventii thou'rt the flower : 
Nor only of this present hour : 
Of all who lived in ages gone, 
Or shall until the years are done." 

(And a rival is assailed, somewhat less coarsely, 
in the few remaining verses of this poem also.) 
With another day comes a less reprehensible 
grievance. " What injury has the great orator 
done you, Catullus ? " " He has tried to pa- 
tronize the impecunious young Transpadane, 
a thing no man shall ever do ! And the town 
shall hear me thank him ! " To cut off all 
doubt, the freshest voice among Latin poets 
chooses to employ a third time the tag all Rome 
knew by heart : 

" Most eloquent, Marcus Tullius, 

Art thou of the sons of Romulus ; 

Of all who lived in ages gone, 

Or shall until the years are done. 

Catullus thanks you heartily : 

The wretchedest of poets he ; 

As far of poets wretchedest, 

As thou'rt of all men patron best." 



As evidence that in private, at least, among 
the enlightened, the absurd side of the Rom- 
ulus-myth was appreciated and familiarly han- 
dled, we need only cite Cicero's own expression 
(Atticum, act II. 1-8) : " Cato talks as though 
we were living in Plato's Utopia, and not, as 
we are, in the rogue's asylum of Romulus." 
(Jeans.) 

As to "pessimus poeta" our editor says : 
" Catullus also speaks of himself with excess- 
ive modesty in addressing his patron Nepos in 
I." Well, yes. He makes his bow to his ma- 
ture, eminent, learned friend (not without a 
mocking sigh over the learning) : 

" This dainty little hook and new, 
Just polished with the pumice, who 
Shall now receive ? 

Cornelius, you ! 

" For these my trifles even then 
You counted of some value, when 
You only of Italian men 

" Into three volumes dared to cast 
The story of all ages past : 
Learned, oh Jupiter, and vast ! " 

Perhaps there is a touch of Shelley's royal mod- 
esty, as he slips the little roll into Nepos' hand, 

" So take it, prize it as you may "; 
but the murmured prayer as he turns, 
" And, gracious virgin, this I pray : 
That it may live beyond our day ! " 

is surely a far cry from "pessimus poeta" 
is less blunt than the assurance of Catullus's 
distant kinsman, 

"Nennt man die grossten Namen, 
So wird auch der meine genannt," 

but Catullus, like Heine, sinned little through 
self -depreciation. Possibly modest Mark Tully 
smiled indulgently, and thought the compli- 
ment not ill-turned ; but certainly the bad boys 
laughed so loudly, perhaps, that even pater 
patriot had an uneasy suspicion, as he passed 
on, that the fast young cantores Euphorionis 
sometimes made game of pompous dignitaries. 
But we have a more serious final exception 
to take. Catullus, of all men, never hesitated 
to say what he meant. It is perilous for a 
commentator to assume that he does not mean 
the thing he says. Exempli gratia : the poem 
in honor of the yacht which had brought her 
master safe home from the Black Sea is a 
general favorite. Now this voyage may have 
been in 56 B. c. Catullus's death is generally 
set about 54, though only because no later al- 
lusions can be positively cited from his poems. 
Dean Smith has discussed this poem in " Har- 
vard Studies" (Vol. III.), with great inge- 
nuity and thoroughness. He insists that the 
craft could not be spoken of as " growing old " 



144 



THE DIAL

only two or three years after her first voyage. 
Alas, the Dean surely never owned a yacht, 
then ! Again, the voyage began at Amastris 
on the Euxine ; while in another poem Catul- 
lus takes leave of his fellow-officers at Nicaea, 
two hundred and fifty miles nearer home. This 
is as if an Englishman returning home from 
Bangor should take ship at New York ! Hence 
Professor Smith puts the voyage back into the 
generation before the poet, assigning it to some 
roving friend of Catullus's father. The chief 
objection to all this is that it destroys the only 
sentiment and significance the poem ever had. 

Professor Merrill praises, and rejects, this 
presentation by his editor-in-chief, and puts 
forth another theory, presumably a new one. 
The poem, he tells us, is a dedicatory inscrip- 
tion, written not for the real yacht, but for a 
miniature model thereof, consecrated in a tem- 
ple of Castor and Pollux, as a thank-offering. 
Both scholars deny that the poet could have 
brought his vessel home to his beloved Sermi- 
one on the Lago di Garda, because it would 
have been extravagant, and Catullus came home 
from Bithynia poor. 

As to the sentiment of the matter, I appeal 
with confidence to lovers of poetry and of 
yachting. But on matters of fact, we have just 
one source of information : the verses of Cat- 
ullus. He does jest elsewhere of his purse-full 
of cobwebs, of his mean and stingy commander- 
in-chief in the Orient, etc. But the poverty of 
this lord of several country-seats, this leader of 
young Rome, is of the jaunty and gentlemanly 
sort. Of course his income is narrow. He 
craves a fortune to fling away on a banquet, 
an amour, a pearl. 

Catullus clung to his Italian promontory 
especially when far away from it. He loved that 
yacht at least in retrospect. He would have 
them together. It would be costly, difficult, 
unheard of, to work her up the Po and Mincio 
to Garda ? Reasons enough, surely, these, why 
the thing must be done ! What old Assian, 
staid and stout and come to forty year though 
he be, would not give more than he can afford 
to see the dear unmanageable old Mezethra rot- 
ting at a Yankee wharf-side, instead of by the 
mole of Mitylene? 

But the poet was rarely at home on Sermi- 
one, rarely at leisure to sail when there ; and 
Garda was but a landlocked millpond to the 
craft built to brave the Pontus's storms and the 
cliffs of the Propontis. And so " Senet quiete" 
" In peace she's growing old." If he built a 
shrine to the Sailors' Friends upon his windy 



promontory, and, anchoring under its shadow, 
dedicated his craft to them, she was so much 
the safer and fitter to bear the " pious bard." 
This, we submit, Catullus says plainly enough. 
Who shall correct him ?

RECENT FICTION.* 



Among the novels accumulated during the past 
few weeks there is no difficulty in selecting the one 
that stands out above all the others, and comes as 
near to being a masterpiece as this degenerate age 
of English fiction will permit any novel to do. And, 
strange to say, although written in English, it is 
not the work of an English novelist at all, but of 
that genial Dutchman who calls himself " Maar- 
ten Maartens," and whose name was absolutely 
unknown to the literary public of four years ago. 
"The Greater Glory" is an ambitious work, but 
in performance it justifies both the scale upon which 
it was planned and the aims which it sought to ac- 
complish. Let us hasten to say, lest the words just 
used should be misunderstood, that the story is not 
didactic in any narrow or obtrusive sense, but that 
it merely exhibits the moral purpose of all great 
fiction, and seeks to set the realities of life over 
against the conventions and the shams, to contrast 
its superficial aspects with its profound inner sig- 
nificance. Readers of "God's Fool" will remem- 
ber how effectively the author had already pui-- 
sued this method, how distinctly he had kept this 
contrast in view. "The Greater Glory" produces 
the same general impression, and has the advantage

of dealing with more natural conditions. There 
was a trace of the repulsive in the former story, 
and the attention of its readers was too much di- 
verted by the curious psychological questionings 
that could not fail to be suggested by the character 
of the reine Thor who was the hero. The hero of 
" The Greater Glory " has all five of his senses, and 
is none the less a hero in the spiritual sense. Lov- 
able in childhood as in manhood, his growth from 
the one stage to the other is depicted with subtle 
psychological insight. As for the Baron, with his old- 
world notions of faith and duty and honor, we pity 
the reader who can stand by his deathbed with un- 
dimmed eyes, or without feeling the better for having 
lived with him. He is instinctively enshrined in the 
memory along with Colonel Newcome and the good 
Bishop of Hugo's best known novel. " The Greater 
Glory " is far from being a perfect work of fiction 
there are few such in the world and its defects 
are easily discernible. It is confused in structure, 
and its architectural analogue would be some irreg- 
ular Gothic cathedral with unrestrained grotesque 
ornamentation. In style, also, it is lacking, being 
over-colloquial and addicted to mannerism. But it 
gives us such a picture of manners and morals as 
only the greater novelists are capable of drawing, 
and it is informed throughout with a nobility of 
sentiment that makes of it a singularly helpful and 
wholesome piece of literature. 

Is there something in the atmosphere of the Ba- 
learic Islands to stimulate the imagination and in- 
cite to the spinning of wild and preposterous yarns ? 
Twice within a few months we have read novels 
having their scene in those islands, and in each case 
the plot has been something distinctly out of the 
common. " The Recipe for Diamonds " was, ac- 
cording to Mr. Cutcliff e Hyne, formulated by no less 
distinguished a character than Raymond Lully, and 
by him intrusted to the keeping of an underground 
Minorcan vault. To this spot certain modern ad- 
venturers, taking their cue from an ancient manu- 
script, were led, and the secret was caught by a pho- 
tographic plate. The original inscription being then 
destroyed, the undeveloped plate remained in sole 
possession, and this plate, unfortunately, lost the 
record forever by exposure. So the reader is left 
none the wiser for it all, and the adventurers get 
nothing for their pains but a small jar of diamonds, 
made by the aforesaid Raymond Lully, and buried 
with the recipe as evidence that it had been a real 
working formula. This outline of the story gives 
but a slight notion of its exciting character, and no 
notion at all of the cleverness with which its char- 
acters and its incidents are fitted together. It is as 
good, in a way, as many of Mr. Kipling's many in- 
ventions, and there is not a little art in its elaborate 
artlessness. It brings one into contact with life 
itself, which is a more worthy task than that of 
making reflections, however subtly analytical, about 
life. The reader may be assured that his interest 
will not be permitted to flag, if he once takes up 
the book for the amusement of an idle hour. 



" Catharine Furze " is a book written under the 
stress of religious emotion, and will appeal to the 
reflective mind. Yet it may hardly be described 
as a novel with a purpose, unless we admit as a pur- 
pose its tacit plea for the importance of the relig- 
ious motive as a determining factor in everyday 
life. It is a simple and depressing story of English 
village people and ways half a century ago. There 
is something of strength in its delineation of the 
titular character, and of one or two others, but the 
book claims more attention for its obvious sincer- 
ity than for any artistic quality of structure or char- 
acterization. 

In reading " A Gray Eye or So " one is struck 
by the lack of development in the characters. They 
are absolutely the same from first to last, although 
the narrative covers time enough to affect their des- 
tinies very materially, and although it is the privi- 
lege, if not the duty, of the novelist to foreshorten 
both in time and space. The gravest defect of the 
story is offered by the hero, who commits an act of 
unspeakable villainy quite out of keeping with the 
general tenor of his character. This is bad enough, 
and that he should have been forgiven for it is worse 
still. A pervasive element of dry satire contrib- 
utes not a little to the interest of this book, for it 
is interesting, although it must be condemned by 
any exacting standard of literary art. The con- 
trasted types, fixed though they are, supply an ex- 
cellent diversity, and the conversations are nearly 
always cleverly managed. If one will forget for 
an hour his critical standards, he may extract much 
entertainment from the book. 

Miss Harraden's " Ships that Pass in the Night " 
is a novel, or rather a nouvelle, that is fairly de- 
serving of the success that it has already obtained. 
It is well-written, and excellent in characterization. 
There are but few figures on the canvas only two 
of any consequence and they are essentially vital 
in delineation. In the character of the hero, Miss 
Harraden has attempted the task so triumphantly 
performed in Charlotte Bronte's " Villette ": that 
of leading us finally to understand and to admire a 
man who is at first, and to a superficial observer, 
almost repellant. Her title is suggested by the 
quatrain, 

" Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing, 
Only a signal shown, and a distant voice in the darkness ; 
So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another, 
Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and silence." 

And it might almost equally well have taken for a 
text Matthew Arnold's more beautiful lines : 
" Yes ! in the sea of life enisled, 
With echoing straits between us thrown, 
Dotting the shoreless, watery wild, 
We mortals million live alone. 
The islands feel the enclasping flow, 
And then their endless bounds they know." 

Readers who can feel the pathos of either passage 
will understand the motive of Miss Harraden's En- 
gadine idyl without reading it. We should not, 
however, advise them to take it thus vicariously, 
for it is well worth an hour's attention. 



[March 1, 



A Woman of Forty " is not, a priori, the most 
prepossessing of heroines, but Miss Stuart has made 
such a heroine interesting, although we are glad 
that the metal more attractive of a maiden less el- 
derly by half finally wins the day, and carries off 
the allegiance of the young New Zealander who is 
given us for a hero. The story is a very slight 
structure, not unpleasing as a sketch of English so- 
cial life, but written in a style that is often diffuse 
and slovenly. On the third page we find such a 
sentence as, " They demeaned themselves to beg 
that their special pictures might be one of his ex- 
hibited portraits." One does not often trap so in- 
excusable a vulgarism and so gross a solecism within 
the limits of one brief phrase. 

Mrs. Campbell-Praed's latest novel is an excit- 
ing but vastly improbable tale. The characters, 
from the Australian heroine to the least of her 
mimerous devoted admirers, are stilted and unnat- 
ural in most of their actions, and few of them suc- 
ceed in arousing either sympathy or respect. The 
padding of the book takes the form of drawing- 
room and dinner-table conversation, always on tap 
for the novelist of impoverished ideas ; and, con- 
sidered as mental food, about as satisfactory as 
sawdust to the physical appetite. Perhaps the best 
thing in this novel is the sketch of a fashionable 
London painter, whose conversation is a delightful 
burlesque of the jargon of his guild. 

Mr. Battershall's story, "A Daughter of the 
World," combines a psychological problem, a study 
in villainy, and a social sketch, and does not very 
happily weld together these disparate themes. Its 
leading motive remotely suggests Tourgue'nieff's 
" Faust." The heroine is a young woman who has 
lost her mother in childhood, and who lives a se- 
cluded life with her father, in his country home. 
The latter, knowing his daughter to have inherited 
an unusually sensitive and emotional nature, seeks 
to secure for her a tranquil future by keeping her a 
child. With this object in view, he entrusts her 
education to a priest, who is really a disciple of 
Molinos and a mystic, who becomes her sole teacher 
and guide, and whose system is directed towards 
the one end of repressing her natural instincts, and 
of leading her in the ways of quietism. The plan 
bids fair to prove successful, when a disturbing ele- 
ment enters her life in the shape of a young man, 
whom first sympathy, and afterwards love, impels 
to save her from the consequences of this unnatural 
discipline. In this effort he is successful, but the 
outcome is not tragic, as in the Russian masterpiece 
that has been mentioned. The young woman, after 
a period of storm and stress, during which she dis- 
appears from view, becomes a successful singer, and 
in this character once more meets the man who 
stood at the turning-point of her life years before. 
The end is both natural and commonplace. We 
think the writer has weakened his story by super- 
adding upon its fundamental structure the stock 
situations and incidents that mostly make up the 



latter half of the book. We could spare both the 
villainy and the social complications that have been 
so incongruously attached to the promising central 
theme. The character of Father Axon, the mystic, 
is impressively presented, although with a certain 
tinge of the melodramatic that does not add to its 
strength. The hero is a somewhat colorless creatior , 
but the heroine is interesting enough to make up 
for his defects. 

One of the minor characters in Miss Long's "Ap- 
prentices to Destiny " is a woman who writes novels. 
Speaking of the problems of her profession, she re- 
marks : " For one thing, there is the little fact that 
book-reviewers are mostly men and the readers 
mostly women. If you write with an eye to getting 
good notices your book isn't read, and if you write 
for readers the superior critics sniff at you." This 
is amusing, if exaggerated, but we ventui-e to con- 
tribute a trifle towards the disproof of the proposi- 
tion. For Miss Long's story is clearly written for 
readers, even for the most feminine of them, yet far 
from us be the thought of "sniffing" at so clever 
and genuine a book. There are, indeed, two or 
three characters that are imperfectly developed, that 
have not been properly fitted into the economy of 
the structure, and there are some wordy pages that 
a more experienced writer would have condensed or 
omitted ; but Miss Long displays so unquestionable 
a talent for enjoyable and wholesome narrative that 
we are not disposed to carp at her defects. One of 
the characters, however, the woman who rejects the 
man whom she loves to marry him whom she ab- 
hors, we find hard to accept. The motives that 
might impel to such conduct are not distinctly enough 
displayed to make it seem reasonable. The book 
toys with socialism to a certain extent almost 
enough to make it a novel of tendency, but the 
dangerous fascination of that subject for generous 
and over-emotional minds has not, in the present 
case, precluded the other interests that are needful 
for variety's sake, nor has it greatly distorted the 
writer's sympathies from a just appreciation of the 
social problem. 

A volume of stories by Mr. Bret Harte easily 
takes precedence over any other collection of fiction 
in miniature likely to be included in a two months' 
survey of current novelists' work. There are six 
stories in Mr. Harte's new volume, five of them Cal- 
ifornian, and the other Glaswegian (let us say) in 
theme. The Californian stories are a little thin, 
perhaps, but they have the incomparable freshness 
and interest that the author can give to the simplest 
sort of a tale. Jack Hamlin and Yuba Bill are 
old friends of ours, and the other characters are of 
sufficiently familiar type. " The Heir of the Mc- 
Hulishes " is a story in which the author has turned 
to account his experiences as our consular represent- 
ative in Scotland, and his light sure touch is shown 
at its best in this delightful sketch. 

The stream of Mr. Harte's stories, we have every 
reason to expect, may flow on forever, but Dr.

THE DIAL 



147 



Doyle's stories, as far as they relate to one Sher- 
lock Holmes, appear to have reached an end with 
the volume of " Memoirs " now published, for the 
artistic and imaginative detective finds his match at 
last in the person of a villain bearing the appropri- 
ate name of Moriarty. The cliff by the Swiss Falls 
of Reichenbach are the scene of the closing catas- 
trophe, which ends the careers of both Sherlock 
Holmes and the only man who ever successfully 
outwitted him. The story of this disaster is the 
last of the dozen contained in the new volume, 
which is quite as thrilling as any of its predecessors. 
Apropos of this closing story, we notice that Mr. 
J. M. Barrie has recently published an amusing 
skit, scare-headed as follows : " The Late Sherlock 
Holmes. Sensational Arrest. Watson Accused of 
the Crime." The following is a characteristic ex- 
tract from Mr. Barrie's jeu d 'esprit : 

" The public cannot have forgotten that Holmes used 
to amuse himself in this room with pistol practice. He 
was such a scientific shot that one evening while Wat- 
son was writing he fired all round the latter's head, 
shaving him by the infinitesimal part of an inch. The 
result is a portrait on the wall in pistol shots of Watson, 
which is considered an excellent likeness. It is under- 
stood that, following the example set in the Ardlamont 
case, this picture will be produced in court. It is also 
in contemplation to bring over the Falls of Reichenbach 
for the same purpose." 

We may also hope, after all, that the rumor re- 
ported by Mr. Barrie, according to which 
" Mr. Sherlock Holmes, at the entreaty of the whole 
British public, has returned to Baker Street, and is at 
present solving the problem of ' The Adventure of the 
Novelist and His Old Man of the Sea,' " 

is not wholly without foundation. 

Of Mr. Henry Harland's five stories, that which 
comes first on the title-page, " Mademoiselle Miss," 
far outranks the others. It is a variation upon the 
text, to the pure all things are pure, for it tells how 
an English girl, happily innocent of any other than 
Ollendorfian French, falls among a set of etudiants 
and etudiantes in a most disreputable pension of 
the Latin Quarter, lives with them in a joyous cama- 
raderie unsullied by the consciousness of any evil, 
and by her very artlessness subdues them into as 
devoted a band of worshippers as ever gathered 
about a pure girl's shrine. The story is a little im- 
possible, but it is very charming. Of the others, 
" The Funeral March of a Marionette " is a char- 
acter study of some subtlety, and "A Sleeveless 
Errand " a semi-humorous sketch with a sadly cyn- 
ical moral. 

Seven of Mr. Stockton's stories, each having its 
quota of delicious absurdities and matter-of-fact 
statements of the unexpected, make up a volume 
that cannot fail to amuse. The story of " Asaph," 
the village loafer who works with his head, is irre- 
sistibly droll, and hardly less so is that of " The 
Watchmaker's Wife," who so unexpectedly comes 
down from the skies, or that of " The Knife that 
Killed Po Hancy," and afterwards inoculates its 



possessor with the predacious instincts of its whilom 
owner. It would take a reader of unusual alertness 
to anticipate the twists and turns of Mr. Stockton's 
fancy, or to forecast the outcome of one of his en- 
tertaining inventions. 

We have often wondered why the inimitable short 
stories of M. Ludovic HaleVy should have been 
missed by the busy tribe of translators. With the 
possible exception of " La Famille Cardinal " (which 
ought, perhaps, to be left in the original as an in- 
centive to the mastery of the French language, if 
not for other reasons), they richly deserved putting 
into English, and we are glad that a selection of 
them has now been gracefully done by Edith V. 
B. Matthews. Nine stories are included in this 
volume, which is one of the " Odd Number " series. 
We find, among others, "Only a Waltz," "The 
Most Beautiful Woman in Paris," " The Insurgent," 
and "In the Express." Professor Brander Mat- 
thews supplies a brief introduction, which happily 
sketches the literary portrait of M. HaleVy, placing 
stress upon his dramatic faculty, his amiable irony, 
and his gentle optimism. The whole thing, introduc- 
tion and translation, is exceptionally well done, and 
the volume ought to prove the most popular of the 
series to which it belongs.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Ancient authorship In these da y s o contention, perhaps 
as studied by a over-contention, about the relations 
modem publisher. o f p u bii s h e rs and authors, and their 
rights and wrongs as regards each other, it is pleas- 
ant to see one who has acquired experience and 
standing as a publisher essaying also the role of 
authorship, thus identifying himself, at least in feel- 
ing, with both classes, and by his widened range of 
sympathies and experience helping to bridge the 
gap that too often separates them or makes their 
attitudes antagonistic. In the case of Mr. George 
Haven Putnam, our present instance, there is little 
enough chance of disagreement, since the author is 
his own publisher, and the relations are presumably 
those of entire harmony ; yet the gain from broad- 
ened experience and standpoint must still be pres- 
ent. Mr. Putnam is already well known as a 
writer on copyright and other practical literary sub- 
jects ; and his present volume, " Authors and Their 
Public in Ancient Times," is the expansion of a 
monograph by him in the cause of International 
Copyright, to which he has been much devoted. 
The work is a complete and compendious history 
of authorship before the introduction of printing. 
Beginning with the earliest graphic forms of liter- 
ature, as traced in the tablets of baked-clay found 
by Layard in the ruins of the palaces of Sennacherib 
and Asshurbanipal ( Sardanapalus ) in ancient Nin- 
eveh, he follows its later records in the papyri 
found in Egyptian tombs and preserved by the

THE DIAL

Greeks when they had Egypt under their control, 
and thence traces its development onward through 
the more familiar achievements of Greece and Rome. 
This current of progress he follows step by step, 
until (the Hebrew and Christian literature inter- 
vening) the monkish rule cast its shadow over the 
stream, and classic glory was all but blotted out by 
the destroying hand of bigotry a hand strong, 
grimy, and relentless in its killing grasp. The 
record closes with the fifteenth century, when the 
invention of printing from movable types vanquished 
priestly hierarchy and put a stop to its avowed pol- 
icy of suppressing reason in the interests of blind 
faith ; and thus a new literature began its enduring 
sway, part of its task being to gather up and pre- 
serve the scattered fragments of the older writings. 
In this beneficent task, Mr. Putnam's book takes 
its modest but indispensable part. It covers a field 
hitherto unreaped or reaped but scantily, and offers 
many curious and suggestive results of the author's 
research. The long struggle for the mere physical 
materials with which to perpetuate thought forms 
in itself a most interesting story. The baked-clay 
was awkward, crude, and cumbersome ; hieroglyphs 
on exposed surfaces are enduring only in the dry 
unchanging air of Egypt ; papyrus has its season 
of decay, and its insect enemies ; parchment will 
mould, and mice will eat it ; brass plates are costly, 
and will rust at last. Only paper frail, perishable 
paper, the dried pulp of vegetable fibres forms 
man's true dependence ; for its cheapness makes it 
plentiful, and by its plentifulness the copies of writ- 
ings become scattered far and wide, so that though 
one copy a year may perish, an edition of six thou- 
sand copies may endure for a period outlasting re- 
corded time. Other chapters in the history are not 
less interesting. They are often enlivened with 
anecdotes and pat quotations, of which the follow- 
ing is an illustration : " ' You have not treated me 
fairly,' writes Alexander to Aristotle, 'in including 
with your published works the papers prepared for 
my instruction. For if the scholarly writings by 
means of which I was educated become the common 
property of the world, in what manner shall I be 
intellectually distinguished above ordinary mor- 
tals ?" How, indeed ? might well be echoed by 
devotees of the modern "limited edition." The 
method of treatment renders Mr. Putnam's volume 
eminently readable, while the story that it tells 
gives one a new sense of the value of that best and 
cheapest thing in the world, a printed book. 

Dr. William Frederick Poole, in ac- 
C6 P tin S the invitation of the North- 
western University to deliver the Phi 
Beta Kappa address of last June, chose for his sub- 
ject "The University Library and the University 
Curriculum." The address is now published (Revell) 
in book form, and makes excellent reading, as those 
acquainted with THE DIAL hardly need to be told. 
Dr. Poole could not write a dull page if he tried, 
and these particular pages are in his most vigorous 



and breezy manner. They open with a plea for 
the university study of books from a bibliographical 
point of view, which naturally leads to the question 
of finding room for such additional work. This 
gives the author an opportunity to assail existing 
methods, especially in the teaching of the classical 
languages. At this point the Mather family are 
brought in, and their example does yeoman service 
for the argument. Within eighty years, eight of 
them were graduated from Harvard, having entered 
at the average age of less than thirteen. They all 
had to speak Latin as an entrance condition, and 
most of them spoke Greek and Hebrew as well. 
Cotton spoke all three when he entered college at 
the age of eleven and a half, and besides this " he 
had composed many Latin treatises, had read Cicero, 
Ovid, Virgil, and Terence ; had finished the Greek 
New Testament; and had read portions of Homer 
and Socrates." More than six hundred books were 
printed by members of the Mather family, and (here 
the bibliophile appears) " their cost in the markets of 
the world exceeds that of the writings of any other 
five families which have ever lived in America." The 
substance of Dr. Poole's charges against the clas- 
sical instruction of to-day is that Greek and Latin 
are not taught as living languages, but are made a 
sort of stalking-horse for the investigation of syn- 
tactical complexities and philological niceties. He 
probably goes too far in assuming that a language 
(ancient or modern) to be really known must be 
learned as a spoken language. We believe the 
speaking of a foreign language to be a mere knack, 
superadded upon the real knowledge obtained from 
its study, but hardly bringing a perceptible incre- 
ment of culture, or of penetration into the meaning 
of the language in question. But there are many 
ways of making a language seem dead to its stu- 
dents besides that of getting along without the du- 
bious aid of viva voce chatter, and it is against these 
ways in general that the author invokes the wrath 
of the Goddess of Common Sense. At all events, 
Dr. Poole is a stanch defender of the classics, and 
his reply to those who call them fetiches is, in sub- 
stance : Begin to study them earlier, and learn them 
more thoroughly than you now do. One other point 
in this address calls for a word of comment. The 
argument against existing college methods is rein- 
forced by some statistics of college attendance, 
which seem to show a decline in the ratio of stu- 
dents to total population. As far as Dr. Poole's 
figures go they are substantially correct, but they 
do not go far enough. He gives figures for the pe- 
riod from 1840 to 1880, showing a decline of nearly 
fifty per cent in college attendance relative to pop- 
ulation. He then adds : " The disparity is doubt- 
less greater now." But a recent investigation of 
this subject made by Mr. Merritt Starr shows a re- 
markable reaction. The decline in (relative) col- 
lege attendance kept on until 1887, but since then 
there has been a steady annual gain, and the figures 
for 1892 bring the record up to the point that had 
been reached in 1860. In a word, the losses of a

quarter-century have been offset by the gains of five 
years. Perhaps the moral of all this is that the 
more vital educational methods championed by Dr. 
Poole already have a stronger hold upon the col- 
leges than he imagined, and that his attack is made 
upon a system already moribund, if not defunct.

reason to be grateful for the efforts 
made to supply his shelves with compendia of the 
world's knowledge. But he should welcome the new 
series of volumes entitled " Periods of European His- 
tory" (Macmillan), for they will provide him if 
the names of their authors count for anything, and 
if the volume now published may be taken as a meas- 
ure of those to follow with a compact and readable 
narrative from the fall of the Western Empire to the 
present time. The volume first published covers the 
period from 476 to 918 ; that is, to the accession to 
the German throne of Henry the Fowler, which 
marked the turning-point in Teutonic (and conse- 
quently European) fortunes or misfortunes. Mr. 
Charles Oman is the author of this volume, being 
peculiarly fitted for the task by his previous work 
as historian of the Byzantine Empire. Its special 
features are, perhaps, besides the attention paid to 
Byzantine annals, its account of the Lombard kings, 
and its story of the Mohammedan invasions of Italy 
and Sicily in the ninth century. If we may judge 
from this opening volume, English history is not to 
come within the scope of the work. At all events, 
there is hardly any mention of Britain in Mr. Oman's 
pages. Professor Tout has undertaken the second 
volume, which will take us to the year 1272. The 
others are in the hands of scholars almost equally 
well known. 



Mre essay* by 
Mr. Birrell. 



We need scarcely bespeak a welcome 

f M August i ne Birrell's latest 



sheaf of essays, " Men, Women, and 
Books" (Scribner), an alluring little volume, gen- 
erally similar in form and contents to his " Obiter 
Dicta " and " Res Judicatae." We own to a hearty 
liking for Mr. Birrell for his wholesome views, 
for his neat and pointed way of putting them, and 
for his ability to say a sensible, even a wise, thing 
in a light and humorous way. In the present vol- 
ume there are in all nineteen titles, " Dean Swift," 
"Dr. Johnson," "Sterne," "John Gay," "Hannah 
More," " Marie Bashkirtseff," " Poets Laureate," 
etc.; rather hackneyed themes some of them, but 
one does not mind that with Mr. Birrell. The pa- 
per on Hannah More, though a little caustic, is de- 
licious almost as good as Lamb. The author 
starts out by saying that Hannah "is one of the 
most detestable writers that ever held a pen," and 
that " she flounders like a huge conger-eel in an 
ocean of dingy morality," after which he proceeds 
to depict the " class " to which she belonged : " This 
class may be imperfectly described as ' the well-to-do 
Christian.' It inhabited snug places in the country, 



and kept an excellent;, if not dainty, table. The 
money it saved in a ball-room it spent upon a green- 
house. Its horses were fat, and its coachman in- 
variably present at family prayers. Its pet virtue 
was church twice on Sunday, and its peculiar hor- 
rors theatrical entertainments, dancing, and three- 
penny points. Outside its garden wall lived the 
poor, who, if virtuous, were forever curtsying to the 
ground or wearing neat uniforms, except when ex- 
piring upon truckle-beds beseeching God to bless the 
young ladies of the Grange or the Manor House, as 
the case might be." In another paper Mr. Birrell 
says a few sensible words touching the importation 
of " McKinleyism " into literature : " The fact is, 
it is a weak point in certain American writers ' of 
the patriotic school ' to be forever dragging in and 
puffing the native article, just because it is native 
and for no other reason whatever ; as if it mattered 
an atom whether an author whom, whilst you are 
discussing literature, you find it convenient to quote 
was born in Boston, Lincoln, or Boston, Massachu- 
setts. One wearies of it indescribably." One does' 
indeed ; and we suspect most of our readers will 
go on preferring Wordsworth and Tennyson to Joel 
Barlow, and Holmes and Lowell to the " Sweet 
Singers " of their own respective townships, na- 
tional and local patriotism to the contrary notwith- 
standing. 

A study of ^* Charles Bourgeaud's "Etablisse- 

written inent et Revision des Constitutions 

constitutions. en Amdrique et en Europe " (Paris : 
Thorin) is a solid piece of work that won in 1892 
(and well deserved) the Rossi Prize of the Paris Fac- 
ulte" de Droit. It is now published in a series that in- 
cludes translations from the English of the principal 
works of Maine and Sir Frederick Pollock, so that 
it has no reason to complain of its company. The 
work is a study of the written constitutions of his- 
tory, from the Connecticut " Fundamental Orders " 
of 1639 to the latest experiments of the Latin- 
American republics, with reference to their estab- 
lishment and the provisions made for their amend- 
ment or revision. After an introductory discussion 
of the written constitution, mainly illustrated by 
early American examples, the constitutions of the 
present century are taken up seriatim. The funda- 
mental division made by M. Bourgeaud is between 
the group of charters or " constitutional facts " and 
the group of truly popular constitutions ; that is, 
constitutions which start out from popular sover- 
eignty as an admitted principle. Under the first 
head are discussed the German, Latin, and Scan- 
dinavian constitutions ; under the second, the con- 
stitutions of France, Switzerland, and the United 
States. The author is to be particularly commended 
for having made a careful study of State constitu- 
tions in this country. Most foreign writers ignore 
them altogether, although they are in many respects 
more instructive than the Federal Constitution it- 
self. In connection with his analysis of the Amer- 
ican constitutional convention and its functions, the

author quotes from Jameson and from Professor 
von Hoist's criticism of Jameson's work. He adds 
in a note that Professor von Hoist, having ac- 
cepted a chair in the University of Chicago, "va 
pouvoir lire ailleurs que dans ses livres." The En- 
glish Constitution, heing unwritten and at any time 
amendable by mere act of Parliament, does not 
come within the scope of M. Bourgeaud's work. 
But the fact that his attention is confined to the 
written constitution does not blind him to the fact 
that there are many things, even in the fundamen- 
tal law of a country, to be sought outside the text 
of any constitutional document. In a pregnant pass- 
age he asserts " que les constitutions e"crites ne sont 
pas 1'unique mesure des institutions politiques d'un 
pays, qu'elles formulent plus qu'elles ne cre'ent, et 
qu'il ne faut pas chercher dans leurs articles toutes 
les normes constitutionelles." And he continues 
as follows : " La declaration des droits de 1'homme 
et du citoyen n'est pas inscrite en les lois de 1875. 
Aucun de'cret de 1'Assemblee de Versailles ne 1'a 
confirme'e. Qui oserait soutenir cependant qu'elle

A Summer ^ captivating little book of English 

ut-of-<ioors origin, that seems as one reads it 

in England. to ex h a l e the odors and reflect the 

hues of the fields and hedgerows, parks and gar- 
dens, through which its author leads us, is John 
Davidson's " A Summer Itinerary " (Boston : Cope- 
land & Day). In it Mr. Davidson presents, with 
much felicity of phrase and fancy, " some notes and 
impressions of the remarkable spring and summer 
of 1893." The " Itinerary " embraces Blackheath, 
Greenwich, Epping Forest, the parks and rural en- 
virons of London in general, the banks of the Lea, 
Kew Gardens, the Chilterns, etc.; and the volume 
closes with A Ballad of a Musician," a production 
which, like the prose, has a savor quite its own. 
Mr. Davidson's writing bears throughout the hall- 
mark of originality, and it has a charm, born partly 
of thought and partly of diction, that is hard to de- 
fine. There is, perhaps, at times a hint of self- 
consciousness, of phrasing that is the fruit of rep- 
etition and experiment ; but we need not quarrel 
with that. Even Ik. Walton, the type of literary 
innocency, has been caught, once at least, hammer- 
ing out his "artless" phrases with all the fore- 
thought and deliberation of a Donne. A fair sam- 
ple of our author's director descriptions is his pic- 
ture of a lark not so poetical, certainly, as Jeremy 
Taylor's or Walton's, but graphic enough : " Then 
came a withered heath ; and out of it, almost from 
between the itinerant's feet, a lark with hissing 
wings shot up like a rocket. Right underneath it 
he watched its ascent ; he had never had such an 
opportunity before. It wedged its way up spirally ; 
and as distance gradually hid the corkscrew motion, 
it seemed to be climbing a stair, moving from side 
to side like a skater. At a certain height the di- 



rect ascent changed to an oblique one ; the lark 
had ceased drilling a passage through the air, and, 
impelled by the momentum acquired in its long 
involved race up the skies, it slid without effort 
high into the blue. The descent was a continua- 
tion of the ascending slide, its wings remaining mo- 
tionless, until, near the earth, they were employed 
as brakes to avoid destruction. And all the while 
the powerful song went on, filling the air." The 
passage has a ring of the observant Jefferies, and 
the reader may profitably compare it with Shelley's 
and Wordsworth's immortal Odes to this " pilgrim 
of the skies." The little book is artistically made, 
and there is a frontispiece fairly rivalling in oddity 
the quaint eccentricities of Madox Brown and E. 
Burne-Jones. 

Complete edition The first volume of the four in which 
of the writings of Mr. Moncure D. Conway intends to 
Thomas Paine. pu bli 8 h "The Writings of Thomas 
Paine" (Putnam) has, after a considerable delay, 
been published, uniform with the biography of Paine 
by the same hand. It includes papers written be- 
tween 1774 and 1779, the most important of them 
being " Common Sense " and " The Crisis." These 
are so well known that mere mention of their in- 
clusion is sufficient. Less familiar are the essays 
reprinted from "The Pennsylvania Magazine" and 
other periodicals of the time. They include " Af- 
rican Slavery in America," Paine's first essay, 
claimed by Mr. Conway to give Paine the title of 
"the first American Abolitionist"; "The Maga- 
zine in America," introductory of " The Pennsyl- 
vania Magazine," which Paine edited for fifty 
pounds a year ; " The Life and Death of Lord 
Clive"; "The Forester's Letters"; and Paine's 
letter of May 16, 1778, to Franklin in Paris. As 
the editor remarks, " No apology is needed for an 
edition of Thomas Paine's writings, but rather for 
the tardiness of their appearance." The work of 
collecting them has not been easy, and their value, 
to the student of American history alone, is hardly 
exaggerated by Mr. Conway when he says that 
" there was no witness with better opportunities of 
information, one more sleeplessly vigilant, or more 
thoroughly representative of public sentiment dur-

A substantial volume called "Deutsch 

German literature in Amerika " (Chicago : Eyller) is 

vn, America. . ,\ < T 

a first instalment or " Beitrage zur 
Geschichte der Deutsch- Amerikanischen Literatur," 
by Dr. G. A. Zimmermann, Superintendent of Ger- 
man in the public schools of Chicago. This volume 
is devoted to " Episch-Lyrische Poesie." It is really 
but the beginning of a comprehensive work (under- 
taken by the Germania Mannerchor of Chicago) 
which is intended to illustrate the achievements of 
the German-American not only in literature, but in 
music, painting, sculpture, and architecture as well. 
Dr. Zimmermann's introductory sketch of German 
literature in America is very interesting. The

THE DIAL

history of the subject begins with 1520, when a 
German adventurer who came over in the train of 
Cortez wrote an account of his experiences. The 
manuscript of this " Zeitung aus Yucatan " was 
discovered about forty years ago, and published at 
Amsterdam. The next date recorded is 1532, when 
Nikolaus Federman described his adventures in Ven- 
ezuela. This work was actually printed in 1536. 
Three other sixteenth-century writings are chron- 
icled, all dealing with South America. These facts 
are curious, but they do not directly concern the 
subject of the work before us, which deals essen- 
tially with the literary production of Germans who 
have settled in America. In the work proper, three 
periods are distinguished : a religious, from 1625 to 
1825 ; a political, from 1825 to 1850 ; and the 
period of immigration subsequent to the latter date. 
The religious period was barren, and three names 
serve to illustrate it. The political period gives us 
a score of " Vor-achtundvierziger," and half as many 
more of the " Achtundvierziger " themselves. Franz 
Lieber, Friedrich Hassaurek, Niklas Muller, and 
Eduard Dorsch are among the better known names 
of this period. In the closing period, about a hun- 
dred and fifty names are represented. The life of 
each author is briefly told, and from one to half a 
dozen of his poems are printed. The work is one 
of much interest, and its preparation must have re- 
quired great industry. 



The latest volume in the " Heroes of 
Henry IV. and the Nations " series (Putnam) is an 

the Huguenots. < \ TI c XT 

excellent account of " Henry of Na- 
varre and the Huguenots in France," by Mr. P. F. 
Willert. A pervert and traitor in the eyes of the 
Protestants and a victim to the knife of a Catholic 
fanatic, Henry the Fourth presents a character dif- 
ficult to judge fairly and calmly. Mr. Willert's 
estimate is just and appreciative. He sees in the 
great Bourbon neither an impossible hero nor an 
unprincipled voluptuary, but a coarse vigorous man 
of action, versatile, daring, and honestly desirous 
of the welfare of his kingdom, with an openness of 
manner and an unfeigned humanity that led even 
his enemies to confess that he had " sublime vir- 
tues." " There was that about him which, what- 
ever he did, prevented his appearing mean or hate- 
ful, and it is not without reason that, of all kings 
who have occupied the French throne, Henry of 
Navarre still retains the first place in the memory 
and affection of his people." 



A new life of 
Catherine IT. 
of Russia. 



Lack of the conventional ingredients 
of romance will scarcely be predi- 
cated of R. Waliszewski's " Romance 
of an Empress " (Appleton), a Life of Catherine II. 
of Russia. Materials for a detailed study of the 
northern Semiramis have only of late years been 
forthcoming ; now, out of the seventy-two volumes 
of documents published by the Russian Imperial 
Historical Society, there are scarcely twenty not 
directly bearing on the history of her reign. The 



author, we learn, has availed himself of these and 
other hitherto unexplored sources with a freedom 
of selection and expression that has resulted in the 
prohibition of his book in Russia from which it 
would seem that the national ability to digest the 
political facts of Russian history is in rather a weak 
and infantile stage as yet. Catherine's personal 
record would certainly bear fumigating ; but we 
find nothing in M. Waliszewski's book especially 
provocative of dynamite. Human society presents 
no more pitiful spectacle than this of a government, 
secular or religious, slinking perpetually into the 
shadow, blinking the light of advancing knowledge, 
and striving to perpetuate its outworn or partly out- 
worn rule by blindfolding the eyes of its depend- 
ants to discreditable truths in its past history. M. 
Waliszewski is a lively and graphic narrator, and 
he has been acceptably translated. There is an in- 
teresting frontispiece portrait of Catherine. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

There seems to be no doubt that Thoreau has become 
an American classic. The fact is emphasized by the " Riv- 
erside " edition of his writings, now complete in ten vol- 
umes ( Hough ton. ) The last of these volumes to be pub- 
lished are " Excursions in Field and Forest " and " Mis- 
cellanies." The former includes " A Yankee in Canada " 
and one or two pieces not before printed in book form. 
The latter opens with Emerson's sketch, which is fol- 
lowed by a number of essays representative of " the 
somewhat less known Thoreau, the student of human 
life, of literature, and religion." Last of all, the vol- 
ume presents translations from ^Eschylus and Pindar, 
and a few original poems. The index to the entire edi- 
tion, which appears in this volume, doubles the useful- 
ness of the work to the student. 

Mr. William R. Jenkins has published three useful 
books for teachers of the French language. Perhaps 
the most valuable of the three is M. A. de Rougemont's 
" Manuel de la Litte'rature Fran^ais," which covers, cur- 
sorily, the last three centuries, and includes extracts, 
biographies, notes, and questions. M. Paul Bercy's 
" French Reader " is designed for advanced classes, and 
is made up of complete stories to the number of thirty, 
by Such nineteenth century authors as Mendes, Mau- 
passant, Coppe'e, HaleVy, Droz, Daudet, and Bourget. 
The third publication is a "College. Preparatory French 
Grammar," by M. Charles P. Du Croquet. It includes 
lessons for a year's work, selections, and all sorts of ex- 
ercises, winding up with a number of specimen college 
examination papers. 

Volume XXXVI. of the "Dictionary of National 
Biography " (Macmillan) opens with an article on Mal- 
thus, by Mr. Leslie Stephen, and carries us through the 
Masons, of whom William, the poet, is also discussed 
by Mr. Stephen's competent pen. The most noticeable 
of the literary biographies is Mr. Sidney Lee's " Mar- 
lowe," which fills ten pages. Even this liberal measure 
is exceeded, however, by Mr. T. F. Henderson's " Mary 
Stuart," which gets no less than eighteen pages, and is 
much the longest biography in the volume. Volume 
XXXVII. of the " Dictionary " extends from Masque- 
rier to Millyng. Mr. Robert Boyle writes on Massinger ;

R. T. Glazebrook, F.R.S., on James Clerk Maxwell;

C. H. Herford on Thomas Middleton, the dramatist. 

"Pictures from Greek Life and Story" (Putnam) is 
the title of the latest of the popular books on ancient 
history which Mr. A. J. Church continues to send forth 
with a regularity that would weary a less facile book- 
maker. In this volume the author succeeds fairly well 
in the attempt to " present a few picturesque scenes 
from Greek story " in the period between Solon and 
Epamiuondas, although the picturesqueness is sometimes 
more apparent in the titles of the sketches than in the 
narrative itself. There are numerous illustrations after 
the antique. 

It is gratifying to see that the renewed interest in 
Greek institutions aroused by the discovery of Aris- 
totle's treatise on the Constitution of Athens has again 
borne fruit in America, this time in a monograph by 
Dr. George Willis Botsford on "The Development of 
the Athenian Constitution," recently issued as the fourth 
number of the Cornell Studies in Classical Philology 
(Ginn). Taking the patriarchal family as the starting- 
point of his work, Dr. Botsford describes in detail the 
constituent elements of Greek society, and traces their 
development at Athens down to the beginning of the 
Peloponnesian war. The material is discussed in a care- 
ful and scholarly manner, and the study deserves a 
creditable place in the rapidly growing literature of the 
subject. 



THE "ANTIGONE" AT TORONTO. 

The representation of a Greek play in its native dress 
is not yet so common an event as not to excite unusual 
interest, though apparently it is becoming a more fre- 
quent occurrence in spite of the growth of a tendency 
to look upon Greek as an obsolescent and useless study. 
It is less than a year ago that the " Antigone " was 
brought out at Vassar College; and the recent celebra- 
tion of the quarter-centennial of the University of Ne- 
braska was made academic by the rendering of scenes 
from the " Electra " and the " Antigone." 

When we saw, a fortnight ago, large placards posted 
about the streets of Toronto, announcing the perform- 
ance of the " Antigone " in Greek by students of the 
University, under the special patronage of the Governor 
General and the Countess of Aberdeen, we wondered 
whether the Zeitgeist would applauding look on with- 
out receiving at least a sop to placate him. The rep- 
resentation, which was given on three successive even- 
ings before large audiences in the Academy of Music, 
was successful in so many ways, and the concessions to 
the notions of the modern stage manager were so few, 
that the University and its friends have good reason for 
self-gratulation. 

Those of us who were from " the States " could not 
be expected to admire the English sound of the Greek 
vowels ; but this might be regarded as a matter of pro- 
vincial prejudice. What seemed more strange to us 
was the peculiar rhythm by which the iambic trimeter 
was given the effect of the choliambus verse, the last 
syllable of the line being treated as short, giving the 
verse an unexpected close as though it were lame. The 



scenery was borrowed from the Vassar representation, 
and the text was furnished by Messrs. Ginn & Company. 
As at Vassar, the chorus and the actors stood on the same 
level, the Greek orchestra serving at the same time 
as the proscenium. No one will claim that the " Antig- 
one " affords a fair test of the soundness of the Dorp- 
f eld theory of the Greek stage as applied to the natural- 
ness and effectiveness of the representation ; yet all, we 
think, will be ready to admit that even in such a play 
as this, in which chorus and actors do not come into 
what may be called hand to hand contact, the pathos and 
power of many of the scenes would be diminished were 
the hero or heroine to be separated from those who are 
appealed to for sympathy and counsel by the space re- 
quired for the Vitruvian stage. 

The well-trained Chorus of fifteen elders was aided 
in the singing by an effective supplementary chorus of 
forty voices. Mendelssohn's music, written for Dou- 
ner's German translation and adapted to the Greek by 
Professor Ramsay Wright, was admirably rendered. 
The Chorus proper indicated by pantomime the senti- 
ment of the odes perhaps too palpably. How far the 
Greeks employed pantomime and action in the choric 
stasima is a matter of conjecture. The hyporchema, 
in which Dionysus is celebrated as a patron god of 
Thebes, was a very realistic Bacchic dance ; it was well 
done, possibly too well done, and here more than any- 
where else there was an appeal to the modern love of 
the spectacular. 

In the absence of stage directions, there is always 
room for differences of interpretation; and if we had 
such directions, would these differences be any the less ? 
Many interpreters make the guard too much of a clown, 
over-emphasize the wrath and excitement of Teiresias, 
and make colorless the thrilling narrative of the messen- 
ger who announces the self-inflicted death of Eurydice. 

The simple dignity and true pathos of this noble 
drama asserted their power over minds accustomed to 
the complex and unnatural realism of the sensational 
drama. Again was proof given of the eternal human- 
ness of " our Sophocles, the royal," who could bring un- 
der the spell of his genius a company of " barbarians " 
to whom the accents of his Attic tongue were as unintel- 
ligible as the confused and harsh cries of the birds that 
flocked about Teiresias on the seat of augury.

When the decease of Tyndall was announced, no fewer 
than six editors of magazines telegraphed to Professor 
Huxley for an article. Mr. Knowles, of " The Nine- 
teenth Century," was slightly quicker than the rest, and 
secured the prize. 

Of 352 cities and towns in the State of Massachu- 
setts, no less than 234 have free public libraries con- 
trolled by the municipality. Libraries partly or wholly 
under private control exist in 74 more of the towns, 
leaving only 44 with no public libraries at all. 

The Converse medals of the Pennsylvania Academy 
of the Fine Arts have been awarded to Mr. D. Ridg- 
way Knight and Mr. Alexander Harrison. Messrs. 
Whistler and Sargent are the fortunate recipients of 
the Temple medals which were awarded by the same 
institution. 

Mr. Henry Harland will act as literary editor of " The 
Yellow Book," the new quarterly to be published in 
London by Messrs. Mathews and Lane. Each number 
of this magazine will be a 320-page book, having the 
outward guise of a French novel. Subjects of the day 
will be expressly excluded from the pages of this enter- 
prise, and only untimely topics will find favor with the 
editors. 

While Hungary was engaged, a few weeks ago, in 
celebrating the fiftieth year of Jokai's literary produc- 
tivity, Spain was engaged in bestowing all sorts of hon- 
ors upon Seiior Nunez de Arce. He was dined by the 
Sociedad de Escritores y Artistas of Madrid, and toasted 
by Seiior Echegaray. Deputations from all over Spain 
were sent to him, together with wreaths of gold, silver, 
and laurel. His early plays were revived in the thea- 
tres, and streets in Toledo and Valladolid were rechris- 
tened with his name. Altogether, he must have been 
highly gratified by the numerous evidences of his popu- 
larity. 

Among the many Spring announcements of Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co., we notice with peculiar interest Mr. 
A. W. Pollard's edition of "The Canterbury Tales"; 
the second volume of Professor Bryce's "American 
Commonwealth"; "Katharine Lauderdale," a novel by 
Mr. F. Marion Crawford; a two- volume edition of "The 
Letters of Edward FitzGerald"; Professor Freeman's 
Oxford lectures on Western Europe in the fifth and 
eighth centuries; "Chronological Outlines of American 
Literature," by Mr. Selden L. Whitcomb; a translation 
of Wiilcker's "History of Anglo-Saxon Literature"; 
and the nine volumes in the dollar edition of Dickens, 
making the series complete. 

Mr. Coulson Kernahan, a young English writer, pub- 
lished not long ago " A Book of Strange Sins," which 
a great many people bought in the expectation of find- 
ing something racy. The contents of the book were, in 
fact, perfectly inoffensive, but it seems that one of its 
critics (possibly one who reviewed it by title) described 
it as unfit for publication. Mr. Kernahan's way of 
meeting the attack is novel. Instead of bringing suit 
for libel, he offers to submit his work to the arbitration 
of six Wesleyan Methodist ministers, agreeing that if 
two out of six say there is anything in it which " ought 
never to have seen the light " he will pay 100 to some 
charitable institution. This shows Mr. Kernahan to be 
of an exceedingly peaceful and conciliatory disposition ; 
it also shows him to have an eye for a good advertise- 
ment. 

Mr. Charles S. Peirce, of Milford, Pa., issues a pros- 
pectus of a work in twelve volumes (each distinct) en- 



titled " The Principles of Philosophy ; or, Logic, Phys- 
ics, and Psychics, considered as a Unity, in the light of 
the Nineteenth Century." The first volume, now ready 
for the press, will be " A Review of the Leading Ideas 
of the Nineteenth Century." Mr. Peirce also issues a 
prospectus of a limited edition, to be printed in two 
colors, of " The Epistle of Pierre Pelerin de Maricourt 
to Sygur de Faucaucourt, Soldier, On the Lodestone." 
The original treatise dates from 1269, and " occupies a 
unique position in the history of the human mind, being 
without exception the earliest work of experimental 
science that has come down to us." The transcript of 
Peter Peregrinus's text has been made afresh from a 
contemporary MS. in the Paris Library, and is repro- 
duced in black-letter, together with a translation and 
notes. 

After a private and somewhat vicarious existence of 
seven years " The Hobby Horse " has been granted a 
new lease of life, and will continue to be issued quar- 
terly in a limited edition to subscribers only. It will 
be under the editorship of Mr. Herbert P. Home, and 
besides its illustrations the magazine will contain arti- 
cles upon Literature, Music, Painting, Sculpture, Archi- 
tecture, and the Decorative Arts; Poems; Essays; Fic- 
tion; and original designs, choicely printed in quarto 
form upon handmade paper. In its list of contributors 
we find such well-known names as Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, 
Sir E. Burne-Jones, Mr. Austin Dobsou, Sir Frederick 
Leighton, Messrs. W. M. Rossetti, John .Ruskin, J. H. 
Shorthouse, Frederick Wedmore, and Oscar Wilde. The 
American market will be supplied by Messrs. Copeland 
& Day, 69 Cornhill, Boston. Number 1 of the new 
series contains, among other articles, a short story by 
Mr. Ernest Dowson; essays "In the Life of Inigo 
Jones," by the editor, and the "Musical Instruments of 
the Angels in Early Italian Art," by Mr. A. J. Hipkins; 
and poems by the editor, Mr. Selwyn Image, and Mr. 
Laurence Binyon. 

EARLY LITERARY DAYS IN CALIFORNIA. 

Mr. Bret Harte gives the following example of liter- 
ary criticism as she was wrote in California some thirty 
years ago. Mr. Harte had just published a volume of 
selected verse from Calif ornian writers: " A well-known 
mining weekly, which I here poetically veil under the 
title of the Red Dog 'Jay Hawk,' was first to swoop 
down upon the tuneful and unsuspecting quarry. At 
this century-end of fastidious and complaisant criticism, 
it may be interesting to recall the direct style of the 
Calif ornian 'sixties': 'The hog wash and "purp"-stuff 

ladled out from the slop-bucket of Messrs. & Co. 

of 'Frisco, by some lop-eared Eastern apprentice, and 
called "A Compilation of California!! Verse," might be 
passed over, so far as criticism goes. A club in the 
hands of any able-bodied citizen of Red Dog and a steam- 
boat ticket to the Bay, cheerfully contributed from this 
office, would be all-sufficient. But when an imported 
greenhorn dares to call his flapdoodle mixture " Cali- 
fornian," it is an insult to the State that has produced 
the gifted " Yellow Hammer," whose lofty flights have 
from time to time dazzled our readers in the columns 
of the " Jay Hawk." That this complacent editorial 
jackass, browsing among the dock and thistles which 
he has served up in this volume, should make no allu- 
sion to California's greatest bard, is rather a confession 
of his idiocy than a slur upon the genius of our esteemed 
contributor.' I turned hurriedly to my pile of rejected 
contributions the nom deplume of 'Yellow Hammer'

did not appear among them; certainly I had never heard 
of its existence. Later, when a friend showed me one 
of that gifted bard's pieces, I was inwardly relieved." 

VERSES BY MR. SWINBURNE TO MR. WILLIAM MORRIS. 

Mr. Swinburne's forthcoming volume of poems is in- 
scribed to Mr. William Morris by a copy of verses in 
the poet's best dedicatory manner. We reprint the 
closing stanzas, about one-third of the entire poem: 

"Truth, winged and enkindled with rapture 

And sense of the radiance of yore, 
Fulfilled you with power to recapture 
What never might singer before 
The life, the delight, and the sorrow 
Of troublous and chivalrous years 
That knew not of night or of morrow, 
Of hopes or of fears. 

" But wider the wing and the vision 

That quicken the spirit have spread 
Since memory beheld with derision 

Man's hope to be more than his dead. 
From the mists and the snows and the thunders 

Your spirit has brought for us forth 
Light, music, and joy in the wonders 
And charms of the north. 

" The wars and the woes and the glories 

That quicken and lighten and rain 
From the clouds of its chronicled stories, 

The passion, the pride, and the pain, 
Whose echoes were mute and the token 
Was lost of the spells that they spake. 
Rise bright at your bidding, unbroken 
Of ages that break. 

" For you, and for none of us other, 

Time is not : the dead that must live 
Hold commune with you as a brother 

By grace of the life that you give. 
The heart that was in them is in you, 

Their soul in your spirit endures : 
The strength of their song is the sinew 
Of this that is yours. 

" Hence is it that life, everlasting 
As light and as music, abides 
In the sound of the surge of it, casting 
Sound back to the surge of the tides, 
Till sons of the sons of the Norsemen 

Watch, hurtling to windward and lee, 
Round England, unbacked of her horsemen, 
The steeds of the sea." 



BROWNING'S "LOST LEADER." 

Who was Browning's " Lost Leader " ? is a question 
that crops out as regularly as " Who are the characters 
in Tennyson's ' Dream of Fair Women ' ? " Its latest 
appearance is in the London "Literary World," where 
it elicits a number of communications, one of which is 
interesting enough to quote. It is a letter written by 
Browning in 1875. 

"Dear Friends, Your letter has made a round to 
reach me, hence the delay in replying to it, which you 
will, therefore, pardon. I have been asked the question 
you put to me though never asked so poetically and 
so pleasantly I suppose a score of times, and I can 
only answer, with something of shame and contrition, 
that I undoubtedly had Wordsworth in my mind, but 
simply as a ' model ' ; you know, an artist takes one or 
two striking traits in the features of his ' model,' and 
uses them to start his fancy on a flight which may end 
far enough from the good man or woman who happens 
to be ' sitting ' for nose and eyes. 



" I thought of the great poet's abandonment of Lib- 
eralism at an unlucky juncture, and no repaying conse- 
quence that I could ever see. But once call my fancy- 
portrait Wordsworth, and how much more ought one to 
say ! There is my apology, dear friends, and your ac- 
ceptance of it will confirm me. Truly yours, 

EGBERT BROWNING." 

Since the anxious inquirer in this latest case was par- 
ticularly troubled by the reference to the " mild and 
magnificent eye " of the " Lost Leader," and could not 
reconcile the description with what he knew of Words- 
worth, another correspondent contributes this passage 
from Hazlitt: 

" His manner of reading his own poetry is particu- 
larly imposing; and in his favourite passages his eye beams 
with preternatural lustre, and the meaning labours slowly 
up from his swelling breast."

BILL NYE'S HISTORY OF THE

$2.00. 

Mr. Nye has taken out all the dry and unmistakable husks 
of history, and told in his own language the story of a nation's 
birth and growth. The book is the most careful and meri- 
torious piece of literary work ever done by this popular au- 
thor, and is a rare combination of information and entertain- 
ment. The artist, by his humorous sketches, has added to 
the attractiveness of the volume.

TWO OFFENDERS. 

By OUIDA. 12mo, cloth, $1 .00. 

" This volume contains two stories, named respectively ' An Ingrate ' 
and ' An Assassin.' They are intensely dramatic in plot, and are tragic 
in their climaxes. ' Ouida ' is always interesting, and in this volume 
is particularly so, because of the vigorous character-studies she pre- 
sents in the heroes of these tales. There is little here of the hard cyni- 
cism and of the pessimism that have been the distinguishing marks of 
her books, while in the qualities of picturesqueness and of world- 
knowledge the volume shows her at her best." Boston Gazette.

VIII. THE GAME OF FARO. IX. PREPARED CARDS. X. DICE. XI. HIGH BALL POKER. XII. ROULETTE AND

***This book will constitute a complete exposure of the methods and devices employed in cheating at the present day, and a revelation of 
the whole of the secrets of the modern gaming sharp. It will be a work absolutely unique of its kind, nothing at all approaching it having ever 
before been published in any language. 

Apart from its value as a warning to those who are addicted to any form of gambling, it is a book which will prove, it is hoped, of the utmost 
interest to the general public, showing, as it does, the capabilities of trickery. Swindling of any kind is only rendered possible by the fact that 
the public have so little knowledge of what can be accomplished by unfair means, and this applies more particularly perhaps to unfair practices in 
play than to any other subject.

CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS. 

By JOHN BEATTIE CROZIER. 

REVISED AND ENLARGED, AND WITH NEW PREFACE. 
More fully explaining the nature of the New Organon used in the solution of its problems. $4.50. 



The Rev. H. R. HAWEIS, M.A., says : 

" This is the most remarkable and important work of the last twenty 
years. It is not too much to say that Mr. Crozier can enter the lists with 
men like Carlyle, Comte, Herbert Spencer, and John Stuart Mill, all of 
whom he treats sympathetically, and hold his own." 
The SPECTATOR says : 

" The book of a very able man. . . . The testimony which we are 
compelled to give to the high ability of this ambitious work is com- 
pletely impartial. . . . Full of original criticism. . . . Great liter- 
ary faculty. . . . A book far less superficial than Mr. Buckle's." 



Mrs. LYNN LYNTON says : 

" The book seems to me to be one of the most original and remark- 
able of the present day. There is not a dry page from cover to cover." 

" KNOWLEDGE" says: 

"No one can rise from the perusal of this work without the convic- 
tion that its author has established a claim to stand high among the 
most profound and original thinkers of the day. He has set himself an 
ambitious task, and he has very narrowly indeed escaped entire suc- 
cess. . . . Will repay perusal and re perusal."

Ready March 2J}. 

Brave Little Holland, and What 
She Taught Us. 

By WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS, D.D., author of "Ja- 
pan," " The Lily among Thorns," [a book of great 
interest on "Solomon's Song"], "Matthew Cal- 
braith Perry," etc. 16mo, with Illustrations, 
$1.25 ; small 16mo, in Riverside Library for 
Young People, 75 cents. 

By three visits to Holland and careful study of Dutch- 
American archives, Dr. Griffis has gained material for a 
very interesting account of Holland and the debt we owe 
her for her contribution to American liberty and order. 

Bayou Folk. 

By KATE CHOPIN. 16mo, $1.25. 
A tasteful book of tales drawn from life among the 
Creoles and Acadians of Louisiana. They represent 
with fidelity and spirit characters and customs unfamil- 
iar to most readers; they are admirably told, with just 
enough dialect for local color; and they can hardly fail 
to be very popular. 

A Bird - Lover in the West. 

By OLIVE THOBNE MILLER, author of " In Nest- 
ing-Time," " Bird-Ways," "Little Brothers of the 
Air," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

This book relates Mrs. Miller's experiences and ob- 
servations of birds in Ohio, Utah, and Colorado. The 
freshness of the field, the new varieties of her beloved 
" Little Brothers of the Air," and her charming skill in 
describing them, make her new book very delightful.

SPRING PUBLICATIONS. 



Oliver Cromwell : A History. 

By SAMUEL H. CHURCH. This work, while presenting as much 
of the history of Cromwell's time as is necessary to show 
his connection with the course of events, attempts, more 
particularly, to be a complete and vivid biography of the 
man, rather than an inquiry into his influence upon the his- 
tory of his time. The work will contain a portrait of Crom- 
well, and battle plans of Naseby and Marston Moor. 8vo, 
$3.00. 

The Writings of Thomas Paine. 

Political, Sociological, Religious, and Literary. Edited by 
MONCURE DANIEL CONWAY. With Introduction and Notes. 
To be complete in four volumes, uniform with Mr. Conway's 
" Life of Paine." Price per volume, $2.50. 
Volume II. now in press. 

The first volume covers the period of the American Revo- 
lution, beginning with the year 1775. It therefore opens with 
Paine's anti-slavery essay and his philosophical or moral es- 
says while editing the "Pennsylvania Magazine," these being 
followed by the great revolutionary, political, and controver- 
sial pamphlets which made such a profound impression on the 
country. 

Piers Plowman 1363-1399. 

A Contribution to the History of English Mysticism. By J. 
J. JUSSERAND, author of " The English Novel in the Time 
of Shakespeare," "English Wayfaring Life in the Middle 
Ages," etc. 12mo, $3.50. 

Random Roaming. 

By the Rev. AUGUSTUS JESSOPP, D.D., author of "The 
Coming of tl^e Friars," "Arcady," "Trials of a Country 
Parson," etc. 12mo, $1.75.

AND THE FALL OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC. By Prof. J. L.

tions Series.) With maps and illustrations. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50 ; half leather, $1.75. 

Tennyson : 

His Art, and His Relation to Modern Life. By the Rev.

The Story of Margredel. 

By a NEW WRITER. Being the Fireside History of a Fife- 
shire Family. Copyrighted American edition, uniform with 
"Ships that Pass in the Night." 12mo, cloth, $1.00. (Ready 
March 3.) 

The story will absorb the attention of the reader until the 
end, but he will desire to wander back again over its pages for 
the pleasure of re-reading the many charming bits of philoso- 
phy and character sketches. The Baillie is excellently por- 
trayed, and the generous nature of the times is admirably re- 
presented by the member of the Crocodile Club, who, with 
the full authority of the club, translated "Dramatis Per- 
sonce," as "a dram for each person." 

American Song. 

A collection of representative American poems, with analyt- 
ical and critical studies of their writers. By A. B. SiM- 
MONDS. 12mo, $1.50.

requirements of higher-grade classes in literature.

WILLIAM FREDERICK POOLE. 

In the death of Dr. Poole, which occurred 
on the first of this month, American history 
has lost one of its best equipped and most pains- 
taking students, the profession of librarianship 
one of its foremost exponents, and THE DIAL 
one of its stanchest friends and most valued 
contributors. Although he had made his home 
for some years past in the university suburb of 
Evanston, a few miles from Chicago, his work 



was done in this city, which has for the past 
twenty years reckoned him among its most dis- 
tinguished citizens. The number of persons 
who, in this great community, are identified 
with intellectual rather than with material in- 
terests is still relatively so small that the dis- 
appearance from our midst of so commanding 
a figure as that of Dr. Poole is a public loss 
more grievous than it would be in many other 
places. His death leaves a social vacancy not 
easily to be filled, even from the public point 
of view ; from that of the friends who have 
loved and honored him for so many years, the 
mere suggestion of its ever being filled is a 
mockery. 

William Frederick Poole was born at Salem, 
Massachusetts, December 24, 1821, thus being 
at the time of his death seventy-two years of 
age. The annals of his career may be briefly 
chronicled. He entered Yale College in 1842, 
and was graduated in 1849. This period in- 
cludes an interregnum of three years spent in 
earning the money needed to complete his col- 
lege education. President Timothy Dwight, 
of Yale University, was one of his classmates. 
From the time of graduation from college to 
the close of his career, the story of his life, 
viewed externally, is little more than a state- 
ment of the various libraries that he was 
called upon to direct or to organize. He was 
an assistant librarian in the Boston Athenaeum 
from 1850 to 1852 ; Librarian of the Boston 
Mercantile Library from 1852 to 1856 ; Li- 
brarian of the Boston Athenaeum from 1856 
to 1869 ; and Librarian of the Cincinnati Pub- 
lic Library from 1869 to 1874. Called, in 
1873, to the work of organizing the Chicago 
Public Library, he entered upon that task early 
in 1874, and remained at the head of the Chi- 
cago institution until 1887, when he was called 
upon to undertake the task of organizing the 
reference library endowed by the late Walter 
L. Newberry, of Chicago, and known by the 
name of its generous founder. During the 
nearly seven years that he lived to act as the 
director of that institution, he collected for its 
uses nearly one hundred thousand volumes, and 
superintended, not many weeks ago, their trans- 
fer to the magnificent new building which is 
to be the permanent home of the Library.

the past twenty years become one of the learned 
professions ; that it has become so is due in 
very great measure to the efforts of Dr. Poole. 
To secure for his fellow-workers the recogni- 
tion accorded to the clergyman, the lawyer, and 
the physician ; to substitute the trained bibli- 
ographer for the mere custodian of books ; to 
establish professional schools of librarianship ; 
to make the public familiar with the principles 
of rational library architecture ; to facilitate 
access to collections of books, and to enlarge 
their usefulness by library helps prepared by 
the cooperation of bibliographers these were, 
briefly stated, the aims towards whose accom- 
plishment he devoted, for a full half-century, 
an exceptionally active and industrious life. 
He was a member of the New York Conven- 
tion of Librarians held in 1853, the first con- 
vention of the sort ever held anywhere. He 
helped organize the American Library Asso- 
ciation in 1876, was one of the Presidents of 
that body, and attended all but one of its an- 
nual meetings. He represented this country 
at the first International Conference of Libra- 
rians, held in London in 1877, and was, in 
1893, at the head of the World's Congress 
Auxiliary Literary Congresses, one of which 
was an International Congress of Librarians. 
The papers published by him upon professional 
subjects are very numerous, but are difficult 
of access. These papers ought to be collected, 
for they contain much material of permanent 
value. 

As a librarian, Dr. Poole's methods were 
characterized by sagacious practicality and clear 
common sense. He mistrusted the elaborate 
scientific systems now in vogue with our younger 
bibliographers ; systems which are excellent for 
the uses of the librarian, but sadly perplex- 
ing to most of the people for whom libraries 
are collected. His methods of classification and 
catalogue-making were to a certain extent em- 
pirical, and not a little is to be said on behalf of 
empiricism in such matters. He never lost sight 
of the fundamental principle that books are 
meant to be used ; that their chief end is not at- 
tained when they are catalogued and shelved. 
He wanted the public to use the books under his 
charge, and encouraged such use in many ways. 
He welcomed the work of University Extension, 
and tried to make the public library a helpful 
adjunct to that work. And long before Uni- 
versity Extension was talked about in this 
country, he sought to bring the school into 
more intimate relations with the library, and 



arranged for bibliographical talks to students, 
illustrated by the literature of the subjects 
talked about. 

Such a collection of Dr. Poole's bibliograph- 
ical papers as we have suggested would be a 
worthy monument to his memory. But a still 
worthier monument already exists in the shape 
of the great " Index to Periodical Literature." 
The author began this important work as a 
student, when he was acting as librarian of 
a college society. Its first edition was printed 
in 1848, making an octavo of 154 pages. In 
1853 it reappeared in an octavo of more than 
three times the thickness of the earlier volume. 
In 1882 ("the author having meanwhile secured 
the cooperation of a number of his fellow- 
librarians) it made its third and final appear- 
ance, again multiplied threefold as to the num- 
ber of pages, and much more than that as to 
the quantity of matter. Two supplements have 
since been published, with the cooperation of 
Mr. W, I, Fletcher, bringing it down to 1892. 

As a student of history, Dr. Poole devoted 
himself chiefly to subjects connected with the 
early settlement of this country. His " Anti- 
Slavery Opinions before 1800 " is a valuable 
contribution to the history of the " peculiar in- 
stitution " in America. His paper on " The 
Popham Colony" discussed certain conflicting 
claims between Maine and Massachusetts as to 
priority of settlement, deciding in favor of the 
latter. He investigated the history of the 
Northwestern Ordinance and the connection 
therewith of Manasseh Cutler, making him- 
self the recognized authority upon that impor- 
tant subject. He pricked the bubbles of the 
Pocahontas story and of the Mecklenburg De- 
claration so effectively that they were relegated 
to the realm of myth, and are not likely again 
to find serious defenders. He published valu- 
able studies in the history of the early North- 
west. Most important, perhaps, of a'll his stu- 
dies were those relating to early Massachusetts 
history, and especially to the Mathers and the 
subject of witchcraft. These subjects were as- 
signed to him in " The Memorial History of 
Boston," and were frequently discussed by him 
elsewhere. He did much to correct the erro- 
neous popular estimate of Cotton Mather, 
showing him to have been learned, sagacious, 
and tolerant, free from responsibility for the 
witchcraft delusion, and a commanding figure 
worthy of the respect and admiration of poster- 
ity. In this, as in other instances, Dr. Poole, 
himself a descendant of the Puritans, stoutly 
defended his ancestors against the misrepresen- 



1894.]

tations under which they have suffered. An- 
other piece of historical work, possibly the most 
important done by him, was his lengthy his- 
torical and critical introduction to the reprint 
of Captain Edward Johnson's " Wonder- Work- 
ing Providence of Sion's Saviour in New En- 
gland." These numerous historical studies, no 
less than those devoted to the professional work 
of the librarian, are so scattered as to be diffi- 
cult of access, and richly deserve collection and 
publication in permanent form. 

Many of Dr. Poole's historical papers were 
contributed to the journal upon which now de- 
volves the sad task of paying a tribute to his 
memory, and it was through his good offices 
that the contents of THE DIAL were, from the 
start, included in the great " Index." The first 
number of THE DIAL appeared in May, 1880, 
and the first article in that number was a re- 
view, by Dr. Poole, of the new edition of Hil- 
dreth. His latest contribution, which appeared 
only last month, and which was probably the 
last piece of work done by him, was that vigor- 
ous defense of the Puritans of which our read- 
ers will hardly need to be reminded upon this 
occasion. Between these two contributions, 
upwards of thirty others from his pen appeared 
in the pages of THE DIAL ; contributions de- 
voted, with a single exception, to subjects in 
American history. Whatever might be his 
subject, the forcible and picturesque qualities 
of his style could not fail to be impressive, 
and the pages that he wrote, however aggressive 
and tending to excite opposition, always held 
the attention, and were never invaded by any- 
thing remotely suggestive of dulness. 

The bibliographer and the historical student 
combined in William Frederick Poole were 
known to the world ; something better than 
these, the man himself, was known to his friends. 
The brusqueness of his manner, at first a little 
repellant to those who came into contact with 
him, was soon seen to be but the outward ex- 
pression of a mental habit of the rarest sincer- 
ity. And upon those who had the privilege of 
his intimacy was made the impression, domi- 
nant above all others, of his absolute integrity, 
intellectual and moral. They realized that here 
was a man who simply could not think one 
thing and say another, or swerve by so much 
as a finger's breadth from what he believed to 
be the right course, were the matter in ques- 
tion great or small. Such men are none too 
common in the world, and when one of them 
leaves it, his place, for those who have really 
known him, is not likely to be filled again. 



THE INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH AT 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY* 

In order to understand the purposes and methods 
of the English courses at the Leland Stanford Jr. 
University, it is necessary to know something about 
our system of what is technically called " major sub- 
jects." At the beginning of his second year in the 
University every student is expected to elect a spe- 
cialty, to which he shall devote at least a third of 
his time throughout his undergraduate course. So 
soon as the specialty, or major subject, has been 
chosen, the professor of that subject becomes the 
student's official adviser, and no degree is granted 
until the course pursued by the student shall have 
been in all respects satisfactory to the professor. It 
will be seen that this system combines the advan- 
tages of great freedom of election on the part of 
the student, with those of direct, close, and friendly 
supervision on the part of an expert. Thus, for 
example, if a student upon entering the University 
chooses English as his major subject, he is expected 
to report every semester to one of the professors of 
English, whose approval he is bound to secure for 
the course he elects. Should the student see fit to 
elect certain subjects not approved by his major 
professor, he is perfectly free to do so, the probable 
result being that his residence at the University is 
so much the more prolonged. If, therefore, a stu- 
dent is willing either to prolong his residence or to 
renounce the hope of obtaining a degree, his free- 
dom of election is conditioned only upon his com- 
petency to get on in the studies elected. The usual 
result of the system is simply this: The student 
takes the five or more hours of work in English (if 
that be his specialty) ; several more hours in col- 
lateral subjects, such as Latin, French, German, or 
History, are recommended by the professor ; and 
the student is left free to choose for himself such 
other subjects as may attract him. 

The practical working of this system has hitherto 
proved very satisfactory. Students elect for the 
most part only such subjects as they have taste or 
talent for, and professors have the pleasure and in- 
spiration of working with earnest and enthusiastic 
men and women. The organic quality of a course 
thus planned from semester to semester by the inter- 
ested student, under the advice of his professor, turns 
out to be far superior to that of the conventional 
college curriculum. Under the system here de- 
scribed, the graduate finds himself pretty thoroughly 
grounded in some science, or in some group of related 
languages, and goes out into the world, not indeed 
master of a specialty, but at least interested in some 
branch of rational research, and versed in the appar- 
atus and methods essential to its further pursuit.

Teaching of English at American Colleges and Universities,

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



I can scarcely define the aims of the courses in 
English better than I have done in the following 
sentence from the University Register: "(1) To 
give training in the formulation and expression of 
thought; (2) to impart a scientific knowledge of 
the English Language and of literary history, En- 
glish and European ; (3) to acquaint the student 
with a juster and more liberal method of literary 
criticism ; (4) to introduce him to literature as an 
art, to cultivate a refined appreciation of what is 
best, and thus to reveal unfailing sources of pure 
enjoyment." 

Before proceeding to describe the courses, it may 
be well to advert briefly to the English preparation 
exacted for admission to the University. The re- 
quirements for admission were at first modelled 
upon those of the University of California, which 
are similar to those of the New England Asso- 
ciation of Colleges : namely, a play or two of Shake- 
speare, the Sir Roger de Coverley Papers, a story 
of Thackeray, and a few of the masterpieces of En- 
glish and American poetry. Under this system the 
examination consists mainly in a test of the ap- 
plicant's ability to quote readily, to explain allusions, 
to write outlines and abstracts, and in various ways 
to show upon paper that he has read and digested 
the works in question. While this system is a great 
advance upon the old practice of requiring an ac- 
quaintance with rhetoric and the formal side of 
grammar and composition, experience shows it to 
be not quite sufficient. The tendency is to encour- 
age the " getting up " of a certain number of books, 
and the cramming of a modicum of information 
about words and etymologies, rather than the at- 
tainment of such a practical acquaintance with the 
vernacular as a student needs in order to take a col- 
lege course successfully. We have therefore thought 
it wise to lay more stress upon a student's prepar- 
ation in composition than has hitherto been custom- 
ary in our secondary schools. While there has been 
no nominal increase in the requirements for admis- 
sion in English, it has become, as a matter of fact, 
more difficult for the graduates of high schools and 
other secondary schools to satisfy our requirements. 
Thus, out of perhaps a hundred and fifty applicants 
for admission in English at the beginning of the 
present year, only some forty wrote satisfactory pa- 
pers. It is hoped that our course in adhering rig- 
idly to the relatively high, but really very moder- 
ate, standard of admission in English will have a 
salutary effect upon secondary instruction in Cali- 
fornia and elsewhere. All that we really ask on the 
side of style is that the student be pretty familiar 
with the mechanical details of composition, spell- 
ing, punctuation, correct sentence structure, para- 
graphing, and the like, and that he be able to ex- 
press himself with some idiomatic fluency. 

During the first two years of the short history of 
the English department here, the professors were 
worn out with the drudgery of correcting Freshman 
themes, work really secondary and preparatory, 
and in no sense forming a proper subject of colle- 



giate instruction. This year, in accordance with the 
program sketched above, we have absolutely refused 
to admit to our courses students unprepared to do 
real collegiate work. The Freshman English course 
in theme-writing has been eliminated from our pro- 
gram, and has been turned over to approved teach- 
ers and to the various secondary schools. Had this 
salutary innovation not been accomplished, all the 
literary courses would have been swept away by the 
rapidly growing inundation of Freshman themes, 
and all our strength and courage would have been dis- 
sipated in preparing our students to do respectable 
work at more happily equipped Universities. As it 
is, no student is admitted to the course in English 
composition until he has acquired the proficiency 
above indicated. Instead, therefore, of requiring 
the undivided attention of a half-dozen professors, 
the work in English composition now occupies most 
of the time and strength of two. It is plain, how- 
ever, that one or two additional instructors in this 
important division of the work will be necessary 
next year. It would be bad policy to allow any in- 
structor to devote the whole of his attention to the 
work in English composition ; for however great a 
man's enthusiasm for such work may be, it is inci- 
dent to human nature that no man can read themes 
efficiently for more than three hours at a stretch, 
and that the professor does his theme-reading more 
intelligently and more humanely when a portion of 
his time is spent in research preparatory to higher 
instruction. 

At the outset of his University career, the student 
of English is advised to begin or continue an ac- 
quaintance with one or two, at least, of the chief 
foreign languages, ancient or modern. It is also 
suggested that he make himself proficient in some 
one of the natural or physical sciences, in order that 
he may not remain entirely a stranger to the great 
currents of positive research and philosophy. 

Apart from the advanced work in English com- 
position and forensics, intended to qualify the stu- 
dent to express with idiomatic grace and logical 
cogency whatever he may have to say or to write, 
the first work which confronts the student of En- 
glish at Stanford is a careful study of some of the 
prose writers of the nineteenth century : such as Ma- 
caulay, De Quincey, Carlyle, Savage Landor, Cardi- 
nal Newman, Matthew Arnold. It is a fact that the 
majority of students enjoy good prose at an earlier 
stage of their culture than is requisite to the real 
appreciation of poetry. It is, moreover, observed 
that such a study of the best prose writers gives the 
instructor a fine opportunity to become acquainted 
with his students and to throw out suggestions that 
may help them to correct or cure their illiteracy. 
Moreover, this course proves an invaluable adjunct 
to the course in composition, inasmuch as nothing 
conduces more to the mastery of a good style than 
an intimate acquaintance with the best models. 

The majority of our students come to the Uni- 
versity with little Latin and less Greek ; and even 
those who come to us with thorough training in the 



1894.] 



THE DIAL

rudiments of one or both of these Cultur-Sprachen, 
come entirely innocent of anything in the nature of 
a comprehension of their literary masterpieces. It 
has therefore been thought wise to offer courses in 
ancient and foreign classics, treated through the 
medium of translations. Professor Newcomer is 
now conducting such a course in Homer and Dante, 
devoting one semester to each of these great poets 
whose works, Mr. Lowell has recently told us, 
count among the five indispensable books of the 
world. These courses are largely attended by in- 
terested and earnest students, some of whom are 
acquainted with the classical languages, but most 
of whom are not. I may say that Professor Moul- 
ton's a priori views as to the advantage of courses 
like this are fully borne out by our experience so far. 
If anything like a systematic and thorough reading, 
even of the five indispensable authors enumerated by 
Mr. Lowell, is to be secured on the part of the ma- 
jority of educated men and women in this busy mod- 
ern world, it must be by some such means as this. 
At all events, from the standpoint of the English 
teacher merely, we count the time not lost that is 
spent in acquainting students, as thoroughly as may 
be through translations, with at least a few of the 
masterpieces of the ancient and mediaeval world. 

Possibly some may find it difficult to understand 
why authors belonging to such remote times and 
diverse languages are to be included in courses in 
English. But how can one study modern poetry 
without knowing something, for example, of 
" Thebes and Pelops' line, 
Or the tale of Troy divine " ? 

And how can an aquaintance with these great quar- 
ries of imaginative literature be better obtained, on 
the part of the non-classical student, than by the 
study of a good translation of Homer and of trans- 
lations of a few typical masterpieces of the Athe- 
nian stage ? These last are not neglected. The 
course in the Ancient Classical Drama, studied from 
translations, is similar in aim to the course in Ho- 
mer and Dante, the latter being introductory to 
Spenser and Milton especially, the former to the 
general study of Shakespeare. In the succeeding 
semester an introductory course in Shakespeare is 
Undertaken, which is not only an attempt at an in- 
ductive study of methods of dramatic construction, 
but also a general survey of Shakespeare's life and 
times, his art and his thought. 

In what follows, in order to prevent confusion, I 
shall designate the courses by the numbers by which 
they are known to us. 

Course 26 is a critical study of a few plays of 
Shakespeare, involving a collation of such of the 
quarto and folio editions as may be obtainable in 
cheap reprints. At present, for example, the class 
is engaged in the task of constructing a text of Ham- 
let based upon Victor's reprints of the first and sec- 
ond quartos and the first folio (1623). Members 
of this class are advised to make no use of the work 
of modern editors, but to do their best to form from 
the original editions such a text as the author him- 



self would have approved, thus putting themselves 
back into a time immediately succeeding the au- 
thor's death and the publication of the first collected 
edition of his writings. The value of such work as 
this for the acquirement of a sense of what Shake- 
spearean scholarship means, and, still better, for the 
attainment of fine taste and discrimination in mat- 
ters of textual criticism, should be too obvious to 
require comment. Of course such a class as this 
must necessarily be small, both for the attainment 
of the best results and because only the more ad- 
vanced undergraduates are capable of profiting by 
work of such critical character. Indeed, as matters 
stand at present this course is better suited to the 
graduate student than to any but the more thor- 
oughly trained undergraduates. 

Among the courses preliminary to this more ad- 
vanced Shakespearean study I should have men- 
tioned Course 16, devoted to the Pre-Shakespearean 
Drama and to the Contemporaries of Shakespeare,, 
as well as to a more cursory review of the Growth 
and Development of the Modern European Drama,, 
especially in Spain, Italy, and France. In like- 
manner, Course 17 is in a sense introductory to the 
study of Milton, being a survey of the Minor Poet* 
of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, from 
Tottel's Miscellany to the death of Dryden. As at 
present conducted by Professor Lathrop, this course 
is, however, by no means elementary, involving as it 
does the study and the attempted solution of many 
obscure and vexed questions of literary history. 

Course 18 involves a review of the more note- 
worthy Literary Masters of the English Literature 
of the Eighteenth Century, together with a some- 
what philosophical treatment of the uniquely inti- 
mate and extremely interesting relations between 
literature and life in that time, a time which more 
than any other rang out the old and rang in the new. 

Courses 19 and 20, given by Professor Hudson 
in alternate years, are respectively a comparative 
study of the chief mgvements and tendencies of 
contemporary Literature, and a review of the novel- 
ists of the present century, together with a brief 
treatment of the earlier development of the novel. 

Courses 24 and 25, given in alternate years, are 
respectively devoted to the study of Edmund Spen- 
ser and of John Milton. In the case of Spenser a 
critical examination is made of his chief poems, 
with special reference to their literary and ethical 
qualities, and to the influence of Spenser upon other 
poets ; and in the case of Milton the additional ef- 
fort is made to realize his character and the rela- 
tion of his activity to the time in which he lived. 

Course 27 is a reading course, devoted to the 
somewhat cursory but not necessarily superficial 
reading and interpretation of characteristic longer 
and shorter poems by Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, 
Keats, and Coleridge. 

Course 21, to which three hours a week through 
the year are devoted, is a study of the history of 
American literature and of the most significant 
works of representative writers. In this, as in all 



170 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



other courses in literature, students are in every way 
incited to possess themselves of the complete works 
of the principal masters studied. 

Professor Flugel's undergraduate work consists 
of one elementary course in Anglo-Saxon, and one 
in Chaucer, both three hours weekly through the 
year. The main aim of the former is to introduce 
the student to the spirit of Anglo-Saxon literature, 
and to give him facility in translating, less stress 
being laid upon phonological and grammatical de- 
tails. Inasmuch as all students who make English 
their " major" are required to take this course, and 
as better results may be gained in smaller classes, 
this first year's class in Anglo-Saxon will be divided 
into two sections, in charge of two recently appointed 
assistants. 

From the foregoing outline it will be noted that 
relatively considerable attention is given to the di- 
rect study of the texts of the great classic authors 
who illustrate English literature ; and that, although 
literary history is by no means neglected, it is nearly 
everywhere made subordinate to the supreme aim 
of introducing the student largely to the best litera- 
ture. It seems almost superfluous to add that, 
while every professor employs his own method of 
instruction, no one employs the text-book method. 
Independent first-hand study, and candor in the 
statement of the results gained by such study, are 
invariably encouraged. 

A word in conclusion with reference to that por- 
tion of our work which, from the scholar's stand- 
point, is most interesting if not most important: 
namely, the Philological and Literary Seminaries 
for graduate students. It should be noted that 
a considerable proportion of the undergraduate 
courses are adapted to the needs of graduates of 
other colleges, and of graduates of the University 
in other courses than English ; but for the attain- 
ment of the advanced degrees of Master and Doc- 
tor in English Literature and Philology, every such 
student is required to become a member of the two 
Seminaries. It is impossible here to enter into de- 
scriptive details with respect to this branch of the 
work. At present all of the five professors of En- 
glish are so largely engrossed with the numerous 
undergraduate courses that too little time is left to 
devote to the needs of advanced students ; still, the 
Seminary course is by no means entirely neglected. 

The advanced courses in philology consist of lec- 
tures on Historical English Grammar, on Old and 
Middle English Literature, and on Beowulf (Sem- 
inary). With these will be given in alternate years 
a Seminary course on King Alfred and his time 
(four hours weekly through the year) ; a course in 
Early English Lyrical Poetry from the Anglo- 
Saxon times to the Reformation (three hours through 
the year) ; and a History of Early English Metrics. 

An additional course is given on Early English 
Palaeography intended as a general introduction to 
the " Schrif twesen " of Old England, to the reading 
of English MSS., and to studies in textual criticism. 
Skeat's Facsimiles, and a number of photographs of 



Old English MSS., prepared especially for this class, 
are placed in the student's hands. 

The Literary Seminary is conducted in two di- 
visions : one, under the charge of Professor Hud- 
son, is devoted this year to the development of 
the modern novel ; the other, conducted by myself, 
is now pursuing a comparative study of the chief 
works of Tennyson and Browning, and, incidentally, 
of the predecessors of Tennyson, that is, of the 
authors to whom Tennyson seems either stylistic- 
ally or spiritually most indebted. It should be un- 
derstood that the subjects of the Seminary courses 
vary from year to year, and that, even when it 
seems best to deal with the same subject in two suc- 
cessive years, the method of treatment and the se- 
quence of topics is such that the same individual 
may continue the study with profit. 

I have been requested to add a few statistics. 
Last year six professors gave instruction in thirty 
English courses, to a total of seven hundred and sev- 
enty students, counting by class registration. The 
total number of individuals receiving instruction in 
English was not far from four hundred and fifty. 
The total number of hours per week occupied by the 
lectures of these six professors was fifty-one in the 
first and fifty-six in the second semester. The num- 
ber of lectures or recitations per week required of 
each professor varies from eight to ten. The number 
of students receiving instruction this year is smaller 
than last year, owing to the severer requirements 
in English composition. The number of professors 
is now five : a professor of English Literature, a 
professor of English Philology, an associate profes- 
sor of English Literature, and two assistant pro- 
fessors. There are also two " assistants in English," 
and additional appointments are contemplated.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"TO PART FROM" AND "TO PART WITH." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On these phrases, referred to below as A and B, I 
purpose to remark briefly. 

With B, denoting relinquishment, A was, for a con- 
siderable time, occasionally made one in signification. 
Of producible proofs of this, here are four followed by 
a quotation in which " part from " is noticeably ar- 
chaistic : 

" From all parts of the Hand the people come unto us, bring- 
ing all such things as they had, to wit, sheepe, cockes, etc. 
(from hennes they would not part), and divers sorts of fruits 
and rootes," etc. (Sir Richard Hawkins [died 1622], "The 
Hawkins' Voyages" [1878], p. 228.) 

" And. as it [a chain] was giuen mee with a great deale of 
loue, so did it exceedingly grieue mee that I must shortly part 
so unkindly with it. I would, if I could, haue kept it rather 
than my life, and never haue parted from it." (Rev. James 
Mabbe, Trans, of " Aleman's The Rogue" [1622], Vol. II., 
p. 99.) 

" Some condemned his resignation as an unadvised act ; as 
if he had first parted from his wits, who would willingly part

from a Kingdome." (Rev. Dr. Thomas Fuller, "The His- 
torie of the Holy Warre " [1639], p. 159, ed. 1647.) 

" It being certain, and confirmed by Common Practice, that 
he that voluntarily parts from his right may do it on what 
terms he thinks fit," etc. (Rev. Thomas Creech, "Lucre- 
tius" [1682], Notes, p. 54, ed. 1683.) 

" Their pride tenaciously grasping the shadow of power, 
whilst their poverty constrained them to part from the sub- 
stance," etc. (Anon.," The Minstrel " [1793], Vol. III., p. 30.) 
For B, importing, contextually, personal separation, 
as in " I parted with him," I have at hand quotations, 
dated from before 1600 to our own day, numbering up- 
wards of a hundred. From first to last, however, among 
authors of mark, few have employed it at all freely, while 
many such authors have shunned it wholly. In Gold- 
smith, negligent as he is in his diction, I have noticed 
it but once, and but once in the thousands of pages be- 
queathed to us by Southey. Yet Mr. R. O. Williams, 
in THE DIAL for Jan. 1, roundly avers that it "has 
been classical English for three centuries." There are 
industrious and observant students that know better. 

Dr. O. W. Holmes writes, " I remember a young wife 
who had to part with her husband for a time." Object- 
ing to " part with " here, I have said that " part from " 
should be substituted for it; and because of my having 
said so, Mr. Williams pronounces that " sometimes " my 
judgments " seem arbitrary." My objection was made 
two and twenty years ago. 

Fashions in language change rapidly; and, therefore, 
it does not surprise me that, 1894, 1 find myself obliged 
to alter, in part, my criticism of 1872. 

Though, as I could show from books, " part from " 
him, or her, etc., was common at that date, one very 
rarely hears it now-a-days, at least in English society. 
Indeed, it is, apparently, on the way to become, before 
very long, almost as outworn as " part from " a place. 
They parted," etc., that is to say, mutually, is, how- 
ever, still as current as ever. 

The humbler class of people hereabouts, including 
the most illiterate, continue, as might have been ex- 
pected, to use what Mr. Williams calls a " pedantic af- 
fectation," namely, " I parted from him," and practically 
ignore "1 parted with him." 

I think it worth mentioning, too, that, in a batch of 
680 essays which I have had occasion to go through 
within a few weeks, I came on the like of " I parted 
from him " and " I parted with him " only once each, but 
on " we parted," etc., repeatedly. 

In fact, so infrequent at present is " part with " for 
leave," " take leave of," " be absent from," " go away 
from," etc., and so infrequent has it been for the last 
fifty years, more or less, that it must be ranked, as is 
41 never so," among those second-rate archaisms which 
the best writers of recent times have generally avoided. 
I am convinced, moreover, that any wide and heedful 
reader of English literature will share this opinion with 
me. As to the distinction which Mr. Williams professes 
to have discovered between " part from " and " part 
with," he may be assured that, when he has investi- 
gated further, he will see it to have no foundation but 
fancy. Neither of the combinations, by the by, occurs 
anywhere in the Bible. 

The approved uses of " part with " may here appro- 
priately be enumerated. Primarily, it is a material thing 
that is parted with, by which is meant that one divests 
oneself of it by gift, sale, or loan. Further, one speaks 
of parting wit h a servant; and Lord Macaulay writes of 
James II. that "he parted in anger with his Parlia- 
ment," when he dispensed with it by prorogation. One 



may say, too, with Tom Jones, " I feel my innocence, 
my friend; and I would not part with that feeling for the 
world." Nor, again, need one hesitate to copy the ex- 
pression of Tom Jones, where, alluding to the prospects 
of his odious rival, Blifil, he protests to Sophia Western, 
"Indeed, I can never part with you; indeed, I cannot." 
Permissible, finally, is " part with," for " have done 
with," in the ensuing quotation, concluding this tedious 
letter: 

"I shall only tell you, before I part with this city, . . . 
that as I was one day coming forth from my Inn," etc.

THE EDUCATIONAL VIEW OF MODERN 

LANGUAGE TEACHING. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

I have read with peculiar interest and gratification 
your excellent editorial on " Modern Language Teach- 
ing and Sprachmeisterei " in the last issue of THE DIAL. 
It will be encouraging to modern-language men to know 
that they have the moral support of your journal in 
their efforts to educate "the well-meaning but not 
highly-intelligent public " up to the educational view of 
this question. More than college instructors must the 
less fortunate teachers in the schools contend with the 
rather crude, one might say stubborn, belief that the 
chief aim of the studying of a modern language is the 
ability to speak it. This ability is, however, not to be 
scorned; but the attempt to acquire it, if it must be ac- 
quired in this country, may be relegated to " conversa- 
tional clubs," quite apart from the regular class-room 
instruction and Seminar conferences. The really pro- 
gressive teachers in this profession hold that the study 
of foreign languages and literatures should not only give 
us an insight into the best that has been thought and 
said by other nations, but that, among other things, it 
should lead us to a better conception of humanity and 
consequently to broader human sympathies.

" COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION LATIN." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The correspondent in your last issue who found con- 
solation for the recent fire at the World's Fair grounds 
in the supposed destruction of the Egyptian Obelisk, 
whose Latin inscription has so affronted his scholarly 
sensibilities, will regret to learn that he was premature 
in his rejoicings. The obelisk still stands; and its of- 
fending inscription which moves your correspondent 
to remark that a Freshman in one of his college classes 
would be " sent out of the room " for offering such work, 
and that the Exposition Commissioners responsible for 
it might do well to " get themselves edited " before they 
again " set up a monument to be read by the nations of 
the earth" is still plainly to be read: so plainly, in- 
deed, that a comparison of it with the version given by 
your correspondent reveals no less than eleven errors 
made by him in copying. Is it unseemly to suggest" 
that not alone Exposition Commissioners, but even col- 
lege professors, may on occasion find it advantageous to 
get themselves edited " ? COMMISSIONER.

SOME PICTURES OF NAPOLEOX THE MAN.* 

M. Arthur Levy's "The Private Life of 
Napoleon," essentially a collection of logically- 
ordered extracts taken verbatim from the au- 
thorities and welded into a continuous narra- 
tive in the style of M. Saint- Amand's popular 
books, should prove no less attractive to the 
general reader than useful to the special stu- 
dent. It is a really important work labor- 
saving and vastly entertaining. Picturesque, 
varied, brimming with the piquant gossip of a 
rarely interesting coterie and period, it presents 
in the compass of two moderate octavos facts 
hitherto sown broadcast in sources not always 
familiar or easy of access. M. Levy has cer- 
tainly not written without bias ; but his admir- 
ation for Napoleon has not, so far as we have 
observed, resulted in a Procrustean treatment 
of facts. 

Of Napoleon's early life an unusually satis- 
factory picture is given ; and in these opening 
chapters our confidence in M. Levy is at once 
awakened by the fact that he sensibly declines 
to see in the molehills of his hero's boyhood 
mountains prophetic of his future greatness. 
Every historian, according as he has taken 
upon himself the character of apologist or de- 
tractor, has represented Napoleon during his 
school-days either as a prodigy of youthful gen- 
ius, or as a sullen and obstinate child fore- 
shadowing the ferocious despot. As a matter 
of fact, no child would seem to have been less 
father of the man than was the little appointee 
to the royal school at Brienne. Napoleon was, 
said Chateaubriand, " a boy neither more nor 
less distinguished than his fellows." Socially, 
his position among his schoolmates was not an 
agreeable one. Timid in the use of a language 
imperfectly learned during his three prepara- 
tory months at Autun, a native of a country 
but recently made French a country, more- 
over, then as now marked for peculiarity of 
manners, the little Corsican appeared odd to 
his comrades, and he displayed reserve towards 
those whom he knew to be above him in rank 
and fortune. 

" I was," the Emperor once observed to Caulaincourt, 
" the poorest of all my school-fellows. They always 
had money in their pockets; I never. I was proud, 
and was most careful that nobody should perceive this.

... I could neither laugh nor amuse myself like the 
others. Bonaparte the schoolboy was out of touch with 
his comrades, and he was not popular." 

Thus isolated by his poverty and by circum- 
stances of birth and manners, the boy naturally 
became, for a time at least, a chosen mark for 
the witticisms of the other pupils. The ingen- 
uity of schoolboys in the arts of petty raillery 
is proverbial, and the Brienne young gentle- 
men seem to have been, in this respect, no whit 
behind their kind. They called their victim 
" the Corsican," showered upon him a thousand 
small indignities, nicknamed him (humorously 
enough) "Paitte-au-nez " a variant of the na- 
tive pronunciation of his Christian name Na- 
poleone. No doubt the child was, as Bourrienne 
records, " rendered bitter by the mockery of 
his comrades " ; but the bitterness did not en- 
gender meanness, and we learn from the same 
authority that Napoleon, victim as he was of 
all sorts of bullying, always " preferred going 
to prison himself to denouncing his comrades 
who had done wrong " on days when, being on 
duty, he was charged with some special super- 
vision. Much has been made by hostile histo- 
rians of his threat (at the age of ten), " I will 
do your French people all the harm I can ! " M. 
Taine, with his occasional penchant for remote 
corollaries, has turned this childish outburst ta 
account in a way that recalls his famous logical 
flight from the moist climate of England to 
the " huge feet " of the natives, " like those of 
wading birds, admirable for walking in mud.' r 
That Napoleon's sojourn at Brienne had it* 
bright side appears in the following anecdote, 
though perhaps the story merely illustrates the 
truth that the scenes of one's life, like work* 
in mosaic, are beautiful only from a distance t 
" As the First Consul was walking one day with Bour- 
rienne in the garden of Malmaison, he heard the chim- 
ing of some bells, which always had a remarkable effect 
on him. He stopped, listened delightedly, and said in 
a broken voice: 'That reminds me of my first years at 
Brienne; I was happy then ! '" 

There is abundant evidence that these ten- 
der recollections bore good fruit for his old tu- 
tors and school-fellows. No single petitioner 
whose claim upon the Emperor dated from the 
days at Brienne seems to have remained empty- 
handed or unsatisfied. Even the surly porter 
of Brienne was handsomely installed in the 
lodge at Malmaison ; and a Madame de Mon- 
tesson, who at school had placed upon Napo- 
leon's brow his first (and his most unsullied) 
crown, was summoned to the Tuileries, and 
her property, which had been confiscated, was 
restored to her.

When the young provincial arrived at Paris 
it was certainly not in the guise of the future 
conqueror of the world. He looked like a 
new-comer ; he gaped at everything he saw, and 
stared in rustic amazement at the wonders of 
those streets and boulevards which he was one 
day to sweep of the threatening hordes of fac- 
tious sans-culottism with a murderous discharge 
of grape-shot and the next to fill with the 
signs of imperial magnificence. " His appear- 
ance," said Demetrius Comneno, a Corsican 
compatriot, "was that of a man whom any 
scoundrel would try to rob after seeing him." 
Unlike the goblin Marat and the titanic Dan- 
ton, Bonaparte was not cast by nature in a 
mould suited to the role he was to play. Of 
his first appearance in uniform, M. Levy tells 
an amusing story : 

" While awaiting his orders to join his regiment, he, 
in the highest spirits, as beseems a sub-lieutenant of 
sixteen, put on his uniform, from which all unnecessary 
smartness was excluded, as the state of his fortune only 
permitted what was absolutely requisite. His boots 
were so inordinately large that his legs, which were 
very small, disappeared in them completely. Proud of 
his new outfit, he went off to seek his friends the Per- 
mons. On seeing him the two children Cecilia and 
Laura (the latter was afterwards Duchesse d'Abrante's) 
could not restrain their laughter, and to his face nick- 
named him ' Puss in Boots.' He did not mind, it ap- 
pears, for, according to one of these little wits, the Lieu- 
tenant took them a few days after a toy carriage con- 
taining a puss in boots, and a copy of Perrault's fairy- 
story." 

Napoleon's employment, in 1795, by the all- 
powerful Committee of Public Safety may be 
taken as the real starting-point of his career. 
His condition at this period was, despite his 
services at Toulon and in Italy, sufficiently un- 
promising. He was morally and physically 
wretched. One met him, says the Duchess 
d'Abrantes, wandering about the streets of 
Paris, shabby, awkward, ungainly, his round 
hat thrust down over his eyes, and with his 
curls (known at that time as oreilles de chien) 
badly powdered, half combed, falling in elf- 
locks over the collar of the historic iron-gray 
coat that was one day to serve in some sort as 
an oriflamme or Navarre-plume to the grena- 
diers of Marengo and Austerlitz ; his hands, 
long, thin, and without gloves, because, as he 
said, these were a needless expense ; his boots 
ill - made and ill - cleaned. " But his glance 
and his smile," adds the Duchess, with a fem- 
inine eye for the lights of the picture, " were 
always admirable, and helped to animate an 
appearance always sickly, resulting partly from 
the yellowness of his complexion, which deep- 



ened the shadows projected by his gaunt, an- 
gular, and pointed features." That this triste 
and sombre figure, haunting the streets of Paris 
like an embodiment of the national poverty and 
unrest, was to leap, as it were, in a day from 
want and obscurity to the throne of Charle- 
magne, was a prediction which the Duchess 
does not claim to have hazarded. 

It was Boissy d'Anglas, a man whom he 
hardly knew, who saved Napoleon by commend- 
ing him to Monsieur de Pontecoulant, a mem- 
ber of the Committee of Public Safety, who 
was charged with the direction of military op- 
erations. Matters at the War Office were in 
great disorder at the time, and M. de Ponte- 
coulant made no secret of his perplexities. He 
was discussing them one day at the Convention 
with d'Anglas, when the latter said : 

" I met yesterday a General on half -pay. He has 
come back from the army of Italy, and seemed to know 
all about it. He might give you some good advice.' 
'Send him to me,' said de Ponte*coulant. Next day 
there came to his room on the sixth floor the leanest 
and most miserable-looking creature he had ever seen 
in his life ' a young man with a wan and livid com- 
plexion, bowed shoulders, and a weak and sickly ap- 
pearance.' Boissy d'Anglas had told him that his man 
was called General Bonaparte, but M. de Pontdcoulant 
could not remember this extraordinary name, but he 
thought that this being, notwithstanding his curious ap- 
pearance, had good reasoning faculties. < Write down 
all that you have told me; put it into the form of a 
memorandum, and bring it me,' he said. A few days 
later, M. de Ponte'coulant, meeting Boissy d'Anglas, said 
to him: ' I have seen your man, but he seems to be mad. 
He has not been near me again.' ' The reason is that 
he thought you were laughing at him. He expected 
you would make him work with you.' ' That need not 
be a difficulty; tell him to come back to-morrow.' . . . 
Bonaparte returned next day. After arguing upon the 
statements made in his report, the Minister said to him : 
' Would you work with me ? ' ' With pleasure,' replied 
the young man, seating himself at a table." 

History has recorded the services rendered 
by Napoleon to Pontecoulant, as well as his 
meagre requital at the hands of the Ministry. 
But his star was now in the ascendant ; and the 
13 Vendemiaire saw his final emergence from 
the cloud of poverty and neglect that had 
so long darkened his fortunes. His bearing 
at that crisis so momentous to France recalls 
Bossuet's expression : "In his bold leaps and 
light movements he resembles some vigorous, 
bounding animal that neither mountains nor 
precipices can arrest." In tendering Bonaparte, 
on the eve of this death-grapple with the sec- 
tions, the command of the forces of the Con- 
vention, Representative Barras, says De Segur, 
gave him three minutes to reflect. Of the 
paths offered him, the one led to fortune, the 



174

other to obscurity perhaps to the guillotine, 
whither nearly all possible political roads had 
so long converged ; but the ends of the paths 
were hidden. In three minutes he said to 
Barras, " I accept, but I warn you that, once 
my sword is out of the scabbard, I shall not 
replace it till I have restored order." This 
scene occurred on the 13 Vendemiaire, at one 
o'clock in the morning, when scarcely a man 
had been placed or a gun mounted to repel the 
insurgents. Before daybreak every avenue to 
the Tuileries bristled with cannon ; and when 
the insurgent sections, 30,000 strong, advanced 
along the quays of the Seine, the rue Saint- 
Honore, and other approaches to the scene of 
their former triumphs, they were met by a mur- 
derous discharge of grape that sounded the 
knell of the long Jacobin apotheosis of rags, 
ignorance, and human degradation in France. 
The scanty remnant of French law and order, 
rallied by a man of action, was at last in a 
posture of defence ; and less than an hour of 
actual fighting secured the victory to the Con- 
vention. History can point to ew victories 
so entirely due to the agency of one man. 
With the futile rising of the 13 Vendemiaire 
the history of the Revolution ends, and the 
epoch is in sight when the wearied peasantry, 
welcoming the rule of a strong hand, said, 
" Now we have rest, thanks to God and Bona- 
parte." Unfortunately, the " rest " proved as 
illusory as the coalition. 

Splendid in his new rank, and with the pres- 
tige of victory, the hero of the 13 Vendemiaire 
made a triumphal entry into those drawing- 
rooms where hitherto, small and humble, 
marked from the rest only by his needy ap- 
pearance, he used to come and try to please 
the guests of his patrons. It was shortly be- 
fore the 13 Vendemiaire that he was presented 
to Madame Tallien, and of all who composed 
her salon he was perhaps the least remarkable, 
the least favored by fortune. One evening, 
assuming the guise of a fortune-teller, he seized 
Madame Tallien's hand, and " poured out end- 
less nonsense." The picture is a striking one : 

" The future conqueror of Europe, small and thin, his 
face hollow and pale, like parchment, as he said him- 
self, long hair on either side of his forehead, the remain- 
der of his hair unpowdered, tied into a queue behind, 
clothed in a threadbare uniform, reading the hand of 
her who was called ' the beautiful Notre Dame de Ther- 
midor.' " 

Notable among the amused witnesses of this 
odd scene was a woman " dark-haired, lan- 
guishing, full of listless indifference" whose 
fortunes the young officer's subtlest palmistry 



would scarcely have divined. In five months 
she was to become the wife of the soothsayer ; 
in three years she was to become quasi-sovereign 
of France ; and, in time, the Pope himself was 
to journey to Paris to crown her Empress of the 
French. It was at Madame Tallien's that, after 
the 13 Vendemiaire, Napoleon again met Jo- 
sephine de Beauharnais ; and he " fell in love 
with her," says an eye-witness, " in the fullest 
sense of the word, in all the force of its fullest 
acceptation." Josephine's early attitude toward 
her admirer may be inferred from a letter to 
one of her friends : 

"You have seen General Bonaparte at my house. 
Well, it is he who is good enough to act as stepfather 
to the orphans of Alexaudre de Beauharnais, as husband 
to his widow ! Do you love him ? you ask me. No . . . 
I do not. Then you dislike him ? No ; but my state 
is one of tepidity towards him that is displeasing to 
me, and which, from a religious point of view, would 
shock the goody people more than anything else." 

Josephine, says M. Levy, was of medium 
height, and perfectly proportioned not so 
faded as the caustic Marmont has it. 

" All her movements had a kind of undulating sup- 
pleness, which naturally fell into careless attitudes, and 
imparted to her person a sort of exotic languor. Her 
pale complexion, which gleamed like thin sheets of ivory, 
became slightly animated under the softened reflections 
of large deep-blue eyes, with long lashes slightly curled. 
Her hair, of a shade of chestnut, with a wonderful sheen 
on it, escaped in small curls from a net fastened over it 
with a gold clasp, and the wayward locks added an in- 
definable charm to a countenance whose mobility was 
excessive, but always attractive. Her toilette contrib- 
uted to heighten the ethereal charm of her person. 
Her gown was of Indian muslin, and its exaggerated 
amplitude fell around her body in cloud-like folds. The 
bodice, draped in large pleats across the bosom, was 
fastened at the shoulder by two lion's heads enamelled 
in black. The sleeves were short, and puckered over 
very beautiful arms, ornamented at the wrists with two 
little golden buckles." 

With this charming portrait we shall take 
leave of M. Levy, who certainly merits the 
gratitude of all who desire the data to work 
out for themselves a fair estimate of Napoleon 
the man. Mr. Simeon's translation, while it 
lacks polish, is generally acceptable, and the 
material features of the book leave little to be 
desired. The lack of an index is only partially 
supplied by a copious table of contents.

Walden Pond which, although we have never before 
known it to be classed with American " thinkers," was 
the " friend and helper " of so many of them.

THE DIAL 



PROBLEMS OF MUNICIPAL, REFORM.* 

The republication in book form of Mr. Glad- 
den's series of magazine articles on " The Cos- 
mopolis City Club " gives one a good oppor- 
tunity to consider the position there taken on 
the vital problems of municipal reform. Mr. 
Gladden assumes, in the form of a story, that 
five directors of a public library, viz., a me- 
chanic, a clergyman, a lawyer, a teacher, and a 
business man, finding it impossible to secure 
intelligent consideration of appropriations for 
their institution from the city council, deter- 
mine on municipal reform. They call together, 
by personal invitation, about forty others, rep- 
resentative of the best professional, business, 
and artisan classes, and through committees of 
this body they receive from week to week val- 
uable reports of the good and bad conditions 
of the police, street, educational, and other de- 
partments of the city government. Newspaper 
reporters publish the proceedings, and the com- 
munity becomes stirred up at the revelations 
made. The committee of forty proposes such a 
change in the executive branch of the city gov- 
ernment as to lodge responsibility in a few men 
subject to popular control, instead of its being 
divided up, as in most American cities, among 
aldermen and commissioners. Thereupon the 
self -constituted committee drafts a new charter, 
giving to the mayor the appointment and re- 
moval, without control by the council, of a chief 
of police, of water service, and of every other 
department excepting education. These chiefs 
are to have similar power over their subordi- 
nates, but can appoint none that are not rec- 
ommended by a civil-service board. The objec- 
tion that this is a one-man power is met by the 
statement that the public at present is bereft 
of as much power as in the proposed scheme, 
only that at present the public can hold no one 
responsible for abuse of power and give no re- 
wards for its proper use, since it is impossible 
to fix responsibility. The book further as- 
sumes that the charter meets with such popu- 
lar endorsement that the legislature is obliged 
to grant it, and that under it a pure civil gov- 
ernment is secured, at least for the time being. 
It closes with the prediction that constant vig- 
ilance will be found necessary under any ma- 
chinery, and holds that municipal parties of 
the future will and ought to disagree on ques- 
tions as to the degree of societary or socialistic 
activity in matters of natural monopolies and

in the control of abuses in competitive business. 
As Dr. Gladden remarks in the preface, lit- 
tle is said upon the importance of reforming 
our legislative as well as our executive depart- 
ments. This reform can hardly come until we 
have fewer wards in the large cities, and men 
elected on a general ticket in small cities, so as 
to secure larger constituencies and thus render 
probable the election of men of higher stand- 
ing in the community ; and, also, until we have 
some system of proportional or minority repre- 
sentation. In this way minorities often coin- 
posed of reform elements can be represented 
in the council, which at present is even more 
corrupt than the executive department. 

This interesting book admirably fulfils its 
purpose of presenting practical suggestions for 
the inception of reform work. It is assumed 
that the knowledge of corruption in street con- 
tracts, for example, and the failures to enforce 
gambling and liquor laws, etc., will call forth 
an efficient demand for reform from the vast 
mass of the people. It is to be hoped that 
time will prove the truth of this, but doubts will 
sometime arise as to whether the influential 
classes of any large city really want any better 
government than they have, unless it gets so 
exceedingly outrageous as just now in Chi- 
cago ; for such better government must mean 
less evasion of taxation by the wealthy and 
less profits from public franchises. It is sig- 
nificant to note how the efforts at reform made 
by the mayor of Detroit have been opposed by 
a large portion of the leading people of that 
city. 

Without the hearty cooperation of the best 
classes of our business men, it is not likely that 
the reforms suggested by our author can be ac- 
complished unless associated, almost from the 
start, with demands for economic reform which 
will appeal to the wage-workers and the small 
property-owners sufficiently to arouse not merely 
their sympathy, but their active cooperation. A 
large portion of these classes do not care much 
for civil-service reform, or for securing fewer 
saloon-keepers and more men of business prom- 
inence in public office, unless they can see in 
this a direct stepping-stone to city ownership 
and reduced charges for light and street trans- 
portation, the abolition of the contract system 
on public works, taxation of everybody accord- 
ing to his ability to pay, the prevention of child- 
labor and long hours, and similar reforms. It 
is noticeable that in Dr. Gladden's book these 
demands of the masses are supposed to wait on 
the attainment of administrative purity. This 



176

[March 16, 



is all well and good, provided municipal purity 
can be thus secured. To secure a sufficient 
popular support, however, it would seem as if 
the small home-owner and wage-worker must 
first be convinced that those working for polit- 
ical reform are in hearty sympathy with the ef- 
fort to obtain industrial reforms. To carry out 
many of these reforms, any very large city will 
doubtless require strong ward as well as cen- 
tral organizations, committed to the use of all 
the reputable portions of the Tammany meth- 
ods of organization. A great service has been 
done the public by this little book, which has 
already contributed much to the development 
of the promising, though yet untried, Civic

AN AMERICAN WARRIOR-BISHOP.* 

There is no lack of warlike prelates in the 
annals of the early Middle Ages ; but a warrior- 
bishop in the nineteenth century, and in our 
own country, is an anomaly sufficient in itself 
to justify the writing of his biography. There 
were circumstances attending the acceptance, 
by one of the Southern Bishops, of a commis- 
sion in the Confederate army which make his 
biography an important contribution to the 
apologetic literature of the Confederacy. It is 
significant of the widespread conviction of the 
truth and justice, even holiness, of the cause 
for which the South went to war, that the head 
of the Confederate government, and the South- 
ern people, could set aside all conventional 
ideas of the Christian ministry and urge a 
Bishop to take up arms in defense of a prin- 
ciple ; and that the Bishop himself, who had 
twenty years before declared it incompatible 
with his high calling for a Christian minister 
to bear arms even for self-defense against rob- 
bery on the wild Western frontier, should con- 
sent to lay aside the Episcopal robes and take 
up the sword. We can scarcely imagine any 
other circumstances in which, in the selection 
of military leaders in a great crisis, attention 
would be turned toward the Episcopate. The 
fact that Leonidas Polk was a soldier by he- 
redity and education scarcely relieves these cir- 
cumstances of their strangeness. It is a sig- 
nificant fact, observable in this connection, that 
at the end of the struggle, many of the Con-

M. Polk, M.D., LL.D. In two volumes. New York: Long- 
mans, Green, & Co. 



federate officers turned to the sacred ministry ; 
and as the general officers received one recruit 
from the Episcopate, at the outbreak of the 
war, the Episcopate has since received several 
from that army which fought for and lost a 
great cause. These circumstances are worthy of 
consideration, and should have the effect of 
modifying our judgment of the motives of the 
South in secession. Of the patriotic convic- 
tions of the Confederate leaders, there should 
be no longer any question. Perhaps the time 
has arrived when the people of the North can 
calmly consider this phase of the subject, and 
give due credit ; and should the life of " Leon- 
idas Polk, Bishop and General," secure atten- 
tion to these circumstances, the delay in the 
preparation and publication of these volumes 
(only partly accounted for in the preface) will 
not have been in vain. 

Leonidas Polk was born in Raleigh, North 
Carolina, April 10, 1806. He entered the 
University of North Carolina in 1821, and two 
years later received an appointment to a cadet- 
ship at West Point, whence he was graduated 
in 1827. During his cadetship he came under 
religious influences virtually for the first time, 
and was so deeply impressed that he chose for 
himself a career far different from that of the 
soldier; and in November, 1828, entered the 
Theological Seminary at Alexandria, Virginia, 
to begin active preparations for the ministry. 
He was ordered deacon on Good Friday, 1830, 
married shortly afterwards, and was ordained 
a priest the following year, being then twenty- 
five years of age. Delicate health compelled 
his spending a year in European travel, and 
several years subsequently upon patrimonial 
estates in Tennessee, his time -being divided 
between the improvement of his estate and min- 
isterial duties at Columbia, Tennessee. In 
1838 he was elected Missionary Bishop of the 
Southwest, and was consecrated December 9 
in that year. His jurisdiction embraced Ala- 
bama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, 
and Indian Territory. In 1841 he resigned 
this jurisdiction to become Bishop of the then 
newly-created Diocese of Louisiana. Remov- 
ing his family to Leighton, an estate which he 
purchased in Louisiana, he began a life prob- 
ably common to the Southern Bishops of that 
time. 

That Bishop Polk was an indifferent eccle- 
siastical scholar, his biographer admits ; but he 
was in other respects a model Bishop. The 
task of organizing and building up the Church 
in Louisiana was faithfully performed, and its

affairs were skilfully administered. His abil- 
ity was severely tested by the events of 1861. 
His chief anxiety was the effect of secession 
upon the Church of which he was the chief 
pastor in an important diocese. His view of 
the situation, set forth in a pastoral proclama- 
tion declaring that the constitution of the Pro- 
testant Episcopal Church in the United States 
was dependent upon the integrity of the nation, 
and that the right of a State to secede being 
established, each diocese had the right to se- 

o 

cede from the general organization, and declar- 
ing that Louisiana was therefore an independ- 
ent diocese, was severely criticised by the South- 
ern Bishops as well as at the North. The 
provisional establishment of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of 
America was the result of the discussion that 
ensued, and the complete reunion of the South- 
ern dioceses with those of the North, at the 
close of the war, was one of the happiest events 
in the ecclesiastical history of our country. As 
a matter of fact, however, and from force of 
circumstances, Louisiana remained an inde- 
pendent diocese until after the war. 

Scarcely had the affairs of the Church been 
arranged, when the demand was made upon 
the Bishop for his services in the field. His 
interest in the defense of the Mississippi Val- 
ley having been enlisted, he visited Richmond 
and the camps in the neighborhood, and saw 
the President of the Confederacy and members 
of his cabinet. He was, on all sides, urged to 
take service in the Confederate army. The 
President twice tendered him a Major-Gen- 
eral's commission. The commission was finally 
issued to him, June 25, 1861. He set out at 
once for Memphis, where he took command of 
the military department entrusted to him. From 
that time forth he performed no Episcopal func- 
tions, and, excepting the baptism of two fel- 
low officers, abstained from the performance of 
even priestly offices. He hoped, however, soon 
to be relieved of his military duties and to re- 
turn to his " cherished work." The phrase in 
which he was wont to justify his course in ac- 
cepting the military commission, and to express 
his anxiety to return to his pastoral work, he 
repeated a few days before his death : " I feel 
like a man whose house is on fire, and who has 
left his business to put it out. As soon as the 
war is over I shall return to my proper calling." 
But this was not to be. He occupied Colum- 
bus with his troops ; participated in the battles 
of Belmont, Shiloh, Perryville, Stone Ridge, 
and Chickamauga, and in the Meridian and 



Atlanta Campaigns. On June 14, 1864, while 
reconnoitring upon Pine Mountain, Georgia, 
a cannon-shot from the Federal lines crashed 
through his breast, and left him dead in the 
arms of his faithful friends, General Hardee 
and General Joseph E. Johnston. 

It was a wise provision to divide Folk's biog- 
raphy into two volumes, the first relating the 
career of the Bishop, the latter devoted wholly 
to that of the General. The biographer is the 
son of the Bishop, and was a participant in the 
war from the beginning to the end. His sym- 
pathies are clearly with the military rather than 
with the Episcopal career. He calls other 
hands to his aid in portraying the latter. It is 
wise historic foresight which devotes so much 
time and space to the founding of the Uni- 
versity of the South, whose present assured suc- 
cess justifies the gathering up for careful pres- 
ervation of all that can be learned concerning 
the inception of that grand scheme. The biog- 
rapher restrains a natural tendency to produce 
a memorial volume, filled with eulogy, and lim- 
ited in its interest. He provides an enduring 
contribution to the history of the times, care- 
fully verifying his statements by authoritative 
and official documents. In many cases his 
biography becomes a vindication of his sub- 
ject's military theories and plans, where they 
have been called in question ; and it is likely to 
strengthen the opinion which many now hold, 
that, with greater unanimity among the Con- 
federate leaders, the struggle for the Confed- 
eracy might have eventuated far otherwise than 
it did. 

In only one case can the biographer's sense 
of proportion be said to have failed. To the 
early history of the Polk family, belonging as 
it does to the Revolutionary period, too much 
space is devoted. And family pride prompts 
him to declare for the authenticity of the much- 
disputed Mecklenburg Declaration of Inde- 
pendence of May 20, 1775. Unfortunately, 
the evidence which he adduces is now generally 
conceded to refer to an altogether different 
document. 

The volumes are substantially bound, clearly 
printed (the only typographical errors observed 
occur in two footnotes in the first volume), 
and are furnished with an admirable index. 
The illustrations consist of steel portraits of 
Lieutenant-Colonel William Polk (the Bishop's 
father), of the Bishop at the age of forty-four 
and again at the age of fifty-five, and of Lieu- 
tenant-General Polk two years later, in Con- 
federate gray, full-bearded and looking grizzled

POPULAR STUDIES ix LANGUAGE.* 

Ever since Dean Trench published his sug- 
gestive but wholly unscientific studies in lan- 
guage, a very general popular interest has been 
taken, both in England and this country, in 
etymology. This has shown itself in the wild 
etymological guesses of the newspaper and the 
pulpit, which have so roused the righteous 
wrath of Professor Skeat, in the general im- 
provement of our dictionaries with regard to 
derivations, and last but not least in the pub- 
lication of independent works on various lin- 
guistic problems. At first, these excursions in 
the realm of words were of the same aimless 
character as those of the imaginative Dean of 
St. Paul's ; but during the past ten years or 
more, under the inspiration of advanced Ger- 
man thought, many of them have assumed a 
more serious and systematic character. 

The latest of these serious attempts to pop- 
ularize the results of philological research, and 
also one of the most successful, is Professor 
Clark's " Manual of Linguistics." While the 
author states as his object " to produce a vol- 
ume that will, with fair completeness and in 
moderate compass, present the main results 
of modern phonology," he has " also sought to 
round it off by the addition of such supple- 
mentary matter as may usefully accompany 
the main theme." It is this " supplementary 
matter," so modestly referred to in the pre- 
face, that gives to the book its chief interest 
and value for the general reader ; and hav- 
ing the general reader rather than the amateur 
phonologist in mind, it is this supplementary 
matter that will receive special attention here. 
The main phonetic problems discussed in the 
several chapters are Sound Eelations in Indo- 
European, Analogy, Ablaut and Accent, 
Grimm's Law, and Sound Relations in English. 
Accompanying these are separate indexes of 
the words quoted from the different languages, 
together with a separate index of the English 
words referred to in the last two chapters. 

But even for those for whom the signs and 
symbols of phonology have no charms, there is 

* MANUAL OF LINGUISTICS. By John Clark, M. A. New 
York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



ample material in the opening chapter, which 
deals with that much-abused people, the Ary- 
ans, their language and culture. Disposing of 
the " idyllic, but certainly also idealized, pic- 
ture of the ancient Aryans," with which a past 
generation of scholars has made us familiar, 
the author proceeds to state briefly but clearly 
the latest and most plausible theory with re- 
gard to the primitive state of the Indo-Euro- 
pean peoples : 

" It must not be supposed that the original tribes 
dwelt as next-door neighbours within circumscribed lim- 
its, for they dwelt at long distances, though still in 
touch with one another. They observed various atti- 
tudes towards the sound-norms, had certainly much in 
common, but were also predisposed to change in differ- 
ent degrees and along different lines. Each family of 
languages, each system of sounds, had its own idiosyn- 
crasies. 

" These statements assume the truth of the wave or 
transition theory of Schmidt, approved by Brugmann, 
Paul, and Schrader. This theory has supplanted the 
old or pedigree theory of former writers, according to 
which there was one homogeneous Ursprache, with some- 
thing approaching to a dead level of uniformity, spoken 
by one people dwelling together in unity of speech- 
sound and speech-bent, from whom there hived off 
swarms, which, on geographical disjunction began to de- 
velop differences in language that separated them from 
the other members of their stock, swarms, however, 
which still comprised two or more peoples that for a 
long period were linguistically one." 

To understand this theory we must imagine 
the various Indo-European tribes as occupying 
different but adjacent territories, the spaces 
between being occupied by " transition dialects, 
which gradually shaded off into one another and 
into the main languages that bounded them. 
These have died out with little or no record, and 
left the abrupt transitions we now encounter." 

Apart from its scientific value, this theory 
must commend itself to the ordinary non-lin- 
guistic mind on account of its eminent common- 
sense. It assumes for the primitive languages 
the same general principles that govern lan- 
guage growth as it is going on at the present 
day. It gives to dialectic peculiarities the sig- 
nificance that modern methods claim for them. 

The discussion of the culture of our ances- 
tors is too long and involved to permit of more 
than a very brief summary here. It is hardly 
necessary to state, however, that its results dif- 
fer widely from those referred to by our author 
in his opening words. They show, among other 
things, that the Aryans probably knew none of 
the metals save copper, that their weapons were 
of a very rudimentary kind, that they were not 
acquainted with the art of agriculture, that their 
dwellings were windowless huts " made of such

materials as wood, clay, and plaited twigs, and 
perhaps sunk into the earth for protection." 
Their first clothing was probably hides, to which 
were later added garments made of wool. They 
" were flesh-eaters, and further possessed some 
knowledge of cookery." 

Of special interest is the author's account of 
the Indo-European family relations, and here 
the idealism of the earlier picture is replaced 
by a realism of the most extreme Zola type. 
As in many savage tribes of our own time, 
" Wives were procured, in the very early days of Aryan 
life, when the various wandering households observed 
a semi-hostile attitude to each other, by capture. After- 
wards, when milder manners obtained, purchase was sub- 
stituted." 

As regards the early home of the Aryans, 
our author wisely contents himself with stating 
the various arguments in favor of a European 
and an Asiatic site, and leaves the choice to his 
readers. He seems to show, however, a leaning 
towards Schrader's selection of Eastern Iran. 

The discussion of the origin of speech, with 
which the introductory chapter closes, is, as 
the author himself admits, " slight and frag- 
mentary." It seems a pity that so careful and 
satisfactory a treatment of linguistics should 
be weakest in this so important and much dis- 
cussed point. It is to be hoped that in a later 
edition this defect may be remedied. The book 
would be further improved by the addition of 
a subject index, as the table of contents is not 
sufficiently full to take its place. Let us not 
forget, however, to be grateful for all the good 
things that are offered here, and most of all for 
the development of a more rational general in- 
terest in philological problems which this work 
seems to indicate.

THE GREEXLANDER AT HOME.* 



A most interesting sketch of the life of an 
interesting people is furnished in Nansen's 
" Eskimo Life." Nansen, well known in con- 
nection with the first crossing of Greenland, 
knows the Greenland Eskimo at near quarters. 
He writes : " I dwelt in their huts, took part 
in their hunting, and tried, as well as I could, 
to live their life and learn their language." 
The tarrying for one winter among any people 
cannot give us full knowledge of them, but 
Nansen was a clear-sighted observer and sym- 

* ESKIMO LIFE. By Fridtjof Nansen. Translated by Will- 
iam Archer. New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



pathetic to an unusual degree. The result is 
that he gives us a sketch of unusual fidelity. 
Nansen loves Greenland : 

" It is poor, this land of the Eskimo which we have 
taken from him : it has neither timber nor gold to offer 
us it is naked, lonely, like no other land inhabited by 
man. But in all its naked poverty how beautiful it is ! 
[f Norway is glorious, Greenland is in truth no less so. 
When one has once seen it, how dear to him is the rec- 
ollection ! I do not know if others feel as I do, but for 
me it is touched with all the dreamlike beauty of my 
childish imagination. It seems as though I there found 
our own Norwegian scenery repeated in still nobler, 
purer forms. It is strong and wild, this Nature, like a 
sage of antiquity carved in ice and snow, yet with moods 
of lyric delicacy and refinement. . . . Everything in 
Greenland is simple and great, white snow, blue ice, 
naked black rocks and peaks, and dark stormy sea. 
When I see the sun sink glowing into the waves, it re- 
calls to me the Greenland sunsets, with the islets and 
rocks floating as it were on the burnished surface of the 
smooth softly-heaving sea, while inland the peaks rise 
row on row, flushing in the evening light. And some- 
times when I see the saeter-life at home, and watch the 
sseter-girls and the grazing cows, I think of the tent-life 
and the reindeer herds on the Greenland fiords and up- 
lands: I think of the screaming ptarmigans, the moors 
and willow copses, the lakes and valleys in among the 
mountains where the Eskimo lives through his brief 
summer." 

Few descriptions of any people, in our En- 
glish language, are so scientifically good as this 
of Eskimo life ; yet it is also delightful popu- 
lar reading. There are many reasons why 
the ethnologist finds the Eskimo interesting. 
Scarcely elsewhere is there a race-type, pure 
through so great an area. The Eskimo of 
Greenland and of Western Alaska are physic- 
ally the same. So little variation is there in the 
language that a Greenlander might probably 
travel from his home to Behring's Strait and 
make himself everywhere understood. Life is, 
in general, the same over the whole region. 
The same traditions and beliefs are found 
among the tribes. Of course there are vary- 
ing details. If we compare the Greenlander 
whom Nansen describes with the Central Es- 
kimo of Boas and the Point Barrow Eskimo of 
Murdoch, we shall find many interesting little 
differences ; but these disappear before the won- 
derfully conserved similarity in generalities. 

Look the world over, and we shall nowhere 
find such an example of perfect adaptation to 
environment. We cannot here discuss how 
such adaptation conies : it is there. It shows 
itself in every detail. Notice the skin gar- 
ments, the kayak, the winter house of stones 
and earth, the summer tents of skins, the spears 
and harpoons, the spear throw ing-stick, these 
are but a few examples of adjustment between 



180

[March 16, 



the Greenlander and his surroundings. The 
food he eats, his smoking lamps, the summer 
excursions along the coast, all these are exactly 
proper to his conditions of life. To change 
these adjustments is a misfortune ; to introduce 
new tastes and needs and life is a crime. 

Consider one invention the kayak. A 
problem was presented the Eskimo for solution. 
Wanted a hunting boat, easy to manage, re- 
quiring the least force for its propulsion, light 
but strong, easily righted if upturned by the 
billows. The Eskimo struggles with the prob- 
lem : he produces the kayak a light frame- 
work of wood ; a covering of sealskin usually 
fitted raw and drawing tightly. In the upper 
side an opening only large enough to allow the 
man to pass his legs and lower body through. 
Perhaps six yards in length, its greatest breadth 
may be but eighteen inches ; its depth is little 
more than six or seven inches. Narrowing fore 
and aft from the centre, it ends in sharp points. 
There is no keel. Across the kayak deck, in 
front of the ring surrounding the central hole, 
are perhaps six thongs, while behind there may 
be three to five more. Under these are inserted 
weapons, each in its proper place most conven- 
ient to the hand. To these thongs, too, the 
game is fastened. The boatman, carefully slip- 
ping into the kayak through the hole above, 
sits on the bottom, with a bit of skin for seat, 
cross-legged. With his two-bladed paddle held 
at the middle, and dipping into the water on 
each side in turn, he shoots the slender craft 
ahead rapidly. He wears the half-jacket, or 
the jacket, fastened to himself and to the kayak 
ring in such a way that dashing waves may 
sweep the deck without water leaking in. The 
kayak, with all its appurtenances, is so light 
that it is easily carried on the head. 

But the kayak is no more remarkable than 
the beautiful series of harpoons and spears that 
the Eskimo has devised. The throwing-stick, 
for hurling darts of all kinds, is ingenious. The 
modes of dressing skins, so simple in them- 
selves but so wonderful in their results, are ad- 
mirable. Quaint is the method of preparing 
bird-skins by chewing with the teeth. Only 
recently we have seen one of those marvellous 
robes of eider duck breasts, now such favorites 
in Denmark. It is a work of beauty and of 
art. No doubt, however, every skin has been 
chewed in the mouths of Greenland women. 
Teeth are worn down almost to the gums in 
such work. We cannot even refer to other in- 
genious or interesting arts and industries of our 
Eskimo. 



Rink has made a special study of the tradi- 
tions and superstitions of the Greenland Es- 
kimo. Nansen depends largely upon him for 
the brief sketch he presents of this subject. 
He points out that there has been a profound 
European (Scandinavian) influence upon these 
stories and ideas. Scientific in this compari- 
son, our author is less so when he traces analo- 
gies, often fanciful, between the Greenland 
tales and those of Africa or Polynesia. Very 
interesting is the great prevalence of witch- 
craft among Greenlanders, although Boas finds 
little of it among the Central Eskimo. Surely 
here we find some European influence. In 
witchcraft, human bones, flesh from corpses, 
skulls, snakes, and spiders, are used. Of won- 
derful power is a tupilek, prepared in pro- 
foundest secrecy of various animal bones, skins, 
bits of the anorak (jacket) of the man to be 
injured or, if it cannot be secured, bits of 
seals he has caught all wrapped together in 
a piece of skin and tied. It is brought to life 
by singing charms over it. Then the ilitsitsok, 
or wizard, seats himself on a bank of stones 
near the mouth of a river. He puts his anorak 
on hind-side foremost, draws his hood over his 
face, dangles the tupilek between his legs. This 
makes it grow, and when it has gained its size 
it glides away into the water and disappears. 
It can transform itself into all kinds of ani- 
mals and monsters, bringing ruin and death 
upon the man against whom it is despatched, 
but reacting upon the sender if it fails. 

The character of the Eskimo is singularly 
happy. With no true chiefs, and no marked 
classes, all men are truly equal. The brother- 
hood of man is an axiom practically recognized. 
Time was, before white man- taught avarice 
and personal advancement, when an individual 
could not starve or seriously want. A tribe 
might die for want of food ; but while one had, 
all could claim a share. Crime was rare. Mor- 
ality prevailed, although not by our standard. 
(Much of the moral depravity now existing is 
due to the demoralizing influence of white vis- 
itors.) Even in Greenland we have harmed 
all that we touch. There are regions remote 
from the settlements where Eskimo life still 
goes on in the old and happy way. Nansen's 
chapter on " The Eskimo at Sea " gives vivid 
pictures of it. We can give but one quotation : 

"It is a gallant business, this kayak-hunting: it is 
like a sportive dance with the sea and with death. 
There is no finer sight possible than to see the kayak- 
man breasting the heavy rollers that seem utterly to 
engulf him. Or when, overtaken by a storm at sea, 
the kayaks run for the shore, they come like black 



1894.]

storm-birds rushing before the wind and waves, which 
like rolling mountains sweep on in their wake. The 
paddles whirl through air and water, the body is bent a 
little forwards, the head often turned half backward to 
watch the seas; all is life and spirit while the sea 
around reeks like a seething cauldron. And then it 
may happen that while the game is at its wildest a seal 
pops its head up before them. Quicker than thought 
the harpoon is seized and rushes through the foam with 
deadly aim; the seal dashes away with the bladder be- 
hind it, but is presently caught and killed, and then 
towed away. Everything is done with the same mas- 
terly skill and with the same quiet demeanor. The Es- 
kimo never dreams that he is performing feats of hero- 
ism." 

Our author frequently bemoans the fate of 
the Greenland Eskimo, and mourns that the 
settler and the missionary have wrought havoc 
to his happy life and ancient ways. Truth to 
tell, we agree with him. Most sympathetic 
non - philanthropic visitors to any barbarous 
race which is being made over into civilized 
white men wonder whether, after all, good is 
being done. Nansen says many vigorous things 
in this direction. We quote but one, and that 
quite mild : 

" And lastly comes this question : Can an Eskimo 
who is nominally a Christian, but who cannot support 
his family, is in ill health and is sinking into deeper 
and deeper misery, be held much more enviable than a 
heathen who lives in spiritual darkness,' but can sup- 
port his family, is robust in body, and thoroughly con- 
tented with life ? From the Eskimo standpoint, at any 
rate, the answer cannot be doubtful. If he could see 
his true interest the Eskimo would assuredly put up 
this fervent petition: God save me from my friends; 
my enemies I can deal with myself." 

Seldom do we lay down a book so reluctantly 
it tells so much so well. No thoughtful per- 
son can fail to find it suggestive and helpful. 
Of course, as a piece of bookwork it is well 
done. The illustrations are unusually good. 
The translator, too, deserves no little praise. 
So well has he done his work that he really 
disappears from view, and we forget that the 
author was a Norwegian, and that we are not 
reading his very words, fresh from his pen.

JAPANESE HISTORY AND CIVILIZATION.* 

No intelligent person can, in these days, af- 
ford to be ignorant of the history of Japan, 
and of the manner in which the unique civili- 
zation of that country has been developed.

HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN ( official ) . Yokohama : 
Japan "Mail "Office. 



The Japanese are our neighbors across the Pa- 
cific, which is not an Oceanus dissociabilis to 
" separate " Japan from America, as it is ex- 
pressed in geography, but is a connecting link 
to bind the two peoples in the closest ties. 
Japan was " opened " by the United States ; 
has been materially, politically, socially, edu- 
cationally, and morally assisted by American 
influences in her wonderful career of progress ; 
and appreciates the kindness and friendliness 
of our people. We, in turn, ought to know 
more of our rapidly developing protege ; and 
undoubtedly we learned much during the 
World's Columbian Exposition, in which the 
completeness and the beauty of the Japanese 
exhibits elicited almost universal surprise and 
admiration. These object lessons may also 
have aroused a desire to know still more about 
Japan and the Japanese. 

A book has just been published which satis- 
fies this laudable desire. It comes in clear type 
from the Knickerbocker Press, and is the thirty- 
eighth volume in that admirable series, " The 
Story of the Nations." There has also been 
issued recently from the press of the " Japan 
Mail," of Yokohama, an official history, com- 
piled under the direction of the Department of 
Education, and translated into English by the 
scholarly editor (Captain Brinkley) of the 
" Mail." It is a good-sized book of more than 
four hundred pages, in large type ; it has a neat 
Japanese cover, and contains reproductions of 
pure Japanese illustrations, as well as numer- 
ous collotypes. It is a valuable work ; but as 
it is not easily procurable in this country, and 
is comparatively expensive, its circulation on 
this side of the Pacific will probably be limited. 

True it is, " and pity 'tis 'tis true," with ref- 
erence to Japan, that of making many books 
there is no end "; but " The Story of Japan " 
clearly has a raison d'etre. It cannot, of course, 
take the place of larger and more detailed 
treatises, like those of Griffis, Adams, Eein, 
and others ; but it fills a long-felt want of an 
interesting and accurate connected history of 
Japan, of moderate size and price. The book 
contains some typographical errors, even slips 
in sentence-structure, and a few statements of 
doubtful accuracy ; but as the faults are com- 
paratively insignificant and superficial, while 
the merits are numerous and profound, the 
work stands as a trustworthy guide for the 
reader. The author acted for several years as 
Adviser to the Japanese Minister of Education, 
and rendered excellent service in remodelling 
the system of education along modern lines.

Very appropriately, he puts this residence in 
Japan as " most important " among the sources 
of his material. And it is very evident, not 
only from the perusal of his own work, but 
also from comparison with the above-mentioned 
official history, that he made use of the best 
native ("as well as foreign) authorities. Thirty- 
five appropriate illustrations, including two 
maps, add instruction and interest to the fif- 
teen chapters of text ; and four appendices are 
inserted to give such valuable material as the 
"list of Emperors," "list of year -periods," 
" list of Shoguns," and " laws of Shotoku 
Taishi," a great reformer of the seventh cent- 
ury A. D. The index can be improved ; but the 
titles of the chapters are, in the main, well- 
chosen, and make a suggestive table of con- 
tents. The object of the book is " to trace the 
story of Japan from its beginnings to the es- 
tablishment of constitutional government " ; 
and that story is well told. 

But the writer of Japanese history is con- 
fronted, at the outset, with a serious difficulty. 
In ancient times the Japanese had no literary 
script, so that all events had to be handed down 
from generation to generation by oral tradition. 
The art of writing was introduced into Japan, 
from China probably, the latter part of the 
third century A. D.; but it was not used for 
recording events until the beginning of the fifth 
century. All these early records, moreover, 
were destroyed by fire ; so that the only " re- 
liance for information about . . . antiquity " 
has to be placed in the Kojiki, or " Records of 
Ancient Matters," and the Nihongi, or "Chron- 
icles of Japan." The former, completed in 711 
A. D., is written in a purer Japanese style ; the 
latter, finished in 720 A. D., is " much more 
tinctured with Chinese philosophy " ; though 
differing in some details, they are practically 
concordant, and supply the data upon which 
the Japanese have constructed their " history." 
It is thus evident that the accounts of the B. c. 
period must be largely mythological, and the 
records of the first four centuries of the Chris- 
tian era must be a thorough mixture of fact 
and fiction, which it is difficult carefully to sep- 
arate. According to Japanese chronology, the 
Empire of Japan was founded by Jimmu Tenno 
in 660 B. c.; according to foreign scholars, 
who have sifted the material at hand, the first 
absolutely authentic date in Japanese history is 
461 A. D. If, therefore, the Japanese are given 
the benefit of more than a century, there yet 
remains a millennium which falls under the sac- 
rificial knife of the historical critic. But, while 



we cannot accept unchallenged the details of 
about a thousand years, and cannot withhold 
surprise that even the constitution of New Ja- 
pan maintains the " exploded religious fiction " 
of the foundation of the Empire, we must ac- 
knowledge that the imperial family of Japan 
has formed the oldest continuous dynasty in 
the world, and can probably boast an " un- 
broken line " of eighteen or twenty centuries. 

Dr. Murray, in "The Story of Japan," fol- 
lowing the illustrious example of Arnold in 
Roman history, treats this mythological period 
in a reasonable way. He says : " Yet the events 
of the earlier period . . . are capable, with 
due care and inspection, of furnishing import- 
ant lessons and disclosing many facts in regard 
to the lives and characteristics of the primitive 
Japanese." These facts concerning "native 
culture " pertain to the mode of government, 
which was feudal ; to food, clothing, houses, 
arms, and implements ; to plants and domestic 
and wild animals ; to modes of travel ; to read- 
ing and writing, which were unknown ; to va- 
rious manners and customs ; to superstitions ; 
and to "religious notions," which found ex- 
pression in Shinto, itself not strictly a " reli- 
gion," but only a cult without a moral code. 
" Morals were invented by the Chinese because 
they were an immoral people ; but in Japan 
there was no necessity for any system of morals, 
as every Japanese acted rightly if he only con- 
sulted his own heart " ! So asserts a Shinto 
apologist. And from the fact that so many 
myths cluster around Izumo, it is a natural in- 
ference that one migration of the ancestors of 
the Japanese from Korea landed in that prov- 
ince ; while the legends relating to Izanagi and 
Izanami, the first male and female deities, since 
they find local habitation in Kyushu, seem to 
indicate another migration (Korean or Malay?) 
to that locality. These different migrations 
are also supposed to account for the two dis- 
tinct types of Japanese. 

The continental influences form an impor- 
tant factor in the equation of Japanese civil- 
ization, and are emphasized by Dr. Murray. 
The Japanese "have been from the begin- 
ning of their history a receptive people," and 
are indebted to Korea and China for the be- 
ginnings of language, literature, education, 
art, mental and moral philosophy (Confucian- 
ism), religion (Buddhism), and many social 
ideas. At first the government of Japan was 
an absolute monarchy, not only in name, but 
also in fact ; for the authority of the Emperor 
was recognized and maintained, comparatively

unimpaired, throughout the realm. But the 
decay of the imperial power began quite early 
in " The Middle Ages of Japan," as Dr. Mur- 
ray calls the period from about 700 to 1184 
A. D. The emperors themselves, wearied with 
the restrained and dignified life which, as " de- 
scendants of the gods," they were obliged by 
etiquette to endure, preferred to abdicate ; and 
in retirement " often wielded a greater influ- 
ence and exerted a more active part in the ad- 
ministration of affairs." This practice of ab- 
dication frequently brought a youth, or even 
an infant (of two years, for instance), to the 
throne, and naturally transferred the real power 
to the subordinate administrative officers. This 
was the way in which gradatim the "duarchy," 
as it is sometimes called, was developed, and 
in which seriatim families and even individ- 
uals became prominent. 

First came the Fujiwara family, which for 
about 400 years " monopolized nearly all the 
important offices in the government," but was 
finally deposed by the so-called " military fam- 
ilies." The first of these was the Taira, who, 
after only a short period of power (1156- 
1184), were utterly overthrown and practically 
annihilated. Next came the Minamoto, rep- 
resented by Yoritomo, whose authority was 
further enhanced when the Emperor bestowed 
on him the highest military title, sei-i-tai-sho- 
ffun (barbarian-expelling-great-general). And 
from this time (1191) till 1868 the emperors 
are practically non-entities, and great generals 
actually govern the empire. The Japanese 
Merovingians, however, are never deprived of 
their titular honor by the " Mayors of the 
Palace." 

But the successors of Yoritomo in the office 
of Shogun were young and sensual,* and gladly 
relinquished the executive duties to their guard- 
ians of the Hojo family, who ruled " with re- 
sistless authority " and " unexampled cruelty 
and rapacity," but yet deserve credit for de- 
feating an invading army of Tartars sent by 
Kublai Khan. The great patriots, Kusunoki 
and Nitta, with the aid of Ashikaga, finally 
overthrew the Hojo domination in 1333 ; but 
the Ashikaga rule succeeded and continued till 
1573. It was, however, an Ashikaga Shogun 
who encouraged the quaint tea - ceremonial, 
called cha-no-yu ; it was " in almost the worst 
period of the Ashikaga anarchy " that, in 1542, 
" the Portuguese made their first appearance in 
Japan "; and it was only five years later when 

*" A general has no [worthy] offspring," says a Japanese 
proverb. 



Francis Xavier arrived there to begin his mis- 
sionary labors. . 

The next few decades of Japanese history 
are crowded with civil strife, and include the 
three great men, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and 
lyeyasu, each of whom in turn seized the su- 
preme power. The first named was favorable 
to Christianity ; the other two interdicted it. 
Hideyoshi, who " rose from obscurity solely by 
his own talents," is regarded by Dr. Murray 
as "the greatest soldier, if not the greatest 
man, whom Japan has produced." If this 
statement can be successfully challenged, the 
palm will certainly be awarded to lyeyasu, who 
became the virtual ruler of the Empire in 1600. 
He founded a dynasty (Tokugawa) of Sho- 
guns, who, for more than two hundred and 
fifty years, ruled at Yedo, surrounded by faith- 
ful vassals, and who at least gave the empire 
a long period of peace. His successors de- 
stroyed Christianity by means of a fearful per- 
secution ; prohibited commercial intercourse, 
except with the Chinese and the Dutch, and 
allowed it with these only to a limited extent ; 
and thus crystallized Japanese civilization and 
institutions. It may be true that "Japan 
reached the acme of her ancient greatness dur- 
ing the Tokugawa dynasty "; but it is also 
true that by this policy of insulation and se- 
clusion she was put back two and a half centu- 
ries in the matter of progress in civilization. 

It was in July, 1853, that Commodore Perry 
entered Yedo Bay for the purpose of deliver- 
ing to the Tokugawa Shogun (then supposed 
to be the Emperor) President Fillmore's letter 
asking for a few tradal privileges ; and on the 
last day of this present month of March it will 
be just forty years since the first treaty be- 
tween the United States and Japan was signed 
at Kanagawa by the representatives of the two 
nations. This, of course, brought about, in a 
short time, the utter ruin of the policy of se- 
clusion ; for the negotiation of similar treaties 
with many other nations followed. This was 
also the occasion of the overthrow of the Sho- 
gun (" Tycoon ") in 1868, and of the central- 
ization once more of the actual power in the 
hands of the Emperor. The real causes, how- 
ever, of the revolution were internal, and con- 
sisted partly of jealousy, and partly of a gen- 
uine impulse toward imperialism. This im- 
pulse had been fostered by a study of Japan- 
ese history, which revealed the fact that the 
Shogun, originally only the imperator, had 
usurped most if not all of the governmental 
functions. Thus the old Japanese spirit of in- 



184

tense loyalty to their " divinely-descended " 
ruler once more triumphed in the restoration 
of the imperial authority. 

But the revolution of 1868 did not mean 
the restoration of the absolute despotism and 
the oppressive feudalism of the past. The lat- 
ter institution, by and with the consent of al- 
most all the feudal lords themselves, was abol- 
ished by an imperial edict in 1869 ; and twenty 
years later (February 11, 1889) the Emperor 
promulgated a constitution, by which he vol- 
untarily relinquished to his people many of his 
hereditary and time-honored powers. With 
this gracious act of His Imperial Majesty, Mu- 
tsuhito, the 122d Emperor " in unbroken line " 
from Jimmu Tenno, not inappropriately closes 
" The Story of Japan." For with this ends 
the old Oriental absolute monarchy and begins 
the new constitutional and representative gov- 
ernment. "The King is dead ; long live the

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The Lover's 
Lexicon. 



It was a happy thought that led Mr. 
Frederick Greenwood to write " The 
Lover's Lexicon" (Macmillan). We 
must recognize as genuine literature this collec- 
tion of graceful essays, which is further described 
as " a handbook for novelists, playwrights, philos- 
ophers, and minor poets ; but especially for the en- 
amoured." There are upwards of a hundred brief 
chapters upon such subjects as "Affection," "Be- 
trothal," " Constancy," " Fickleness," " Marriage," 
" Rapture," " Sweetheart," and the like ; each an 
essay in itself, combining wisdom, wit, and the 
charm that comes from a sympathetic presentment 
of high ideals. Both in style and in subtlety the 
book suggests Mr. Stevenson's "Virginibus Puer- 
isque " essays, and should stand beside that volume 
upon the shelf. The quality of the book must be 
set forth by illustration; no description could do it 
justice. The article on " Flirtation " is thus intro- 
duced: "A pastime which, like card-playing, is in- 
nocuous only when nothing is staked that can be 
missed if lost, while it is most harmful when the 
stakes are abstracted from partnership capital. The 
game is usually played by the ruder sex for amuse- 
ment alone, its chief pleasure being the titillation 
and excitement of vanity. By the other it is played 
for amusement too ; but also for practice in various 
kinds of fascination, and to satisfy curiosity as to 
the inner nature of men." Here is an extract from 
the article on " Love-making ": " The effect of mu- 
sic on the passions is not to be measured by beauty 
of melody or cultivation of ear. In half-barbarous 
lands a moaning chant, a twanging of the guitar, 
will raise storms and languishings unsurpassed in a 



German beer-garden ; and then would a man en- 
slave the fair, let him sally forth and stab another 
man for love of her. In more savage countries 
hearts are won in simpler fashion, though much the 
same. The lover goes head-hunting, and on his re- 
turn silently but tenderly leads his beloved to view 
his trophies in a basket. We have amongst our- 
selves a survival from similar kinds of love-making 
in a chastened preference for military men." The 
article on " Dolls " yields this choice bit : " Very 
few girls, however, wish to be thought dolls and 
nothing else. Even those who are nothing else 
have moments of conviction that to be pretty, to be 
bright, to be brainless and useless, puts them at a 
disadvantage everywhere except at picnics, at water- 
parties, and at church." The article " Eros " is 
brief enough to permit of quotation in full : " The 
Greek name for the God of Love, who was much 
better known in England as Cupid till about the 
end of the seventh decade of the present century. 
' Cupid ' then fell out of favor with the literary 
genius of the age ; which, being of a warmer tem- 
perament than preceding geniuses, or desirous of 
seeming so, and conceiving that ' Eros ' stood for a 
bolder, wilder, more faun-like and abandoned sort 
of passion, determined that the god should have 
no other name either in prose or verse. So far, 
however that is to say, up to the date of the 
present publication the change has been coldly re- 
ceived by a public already prejudiced against cer- 
tain derivations of 'Eros' (See art. 'Erotic')." 
Last of all, we will reproduce the close of the arti- 
cle " Love-Pledges ": " Yet there must be no mis- 
prising of love-gifts. They are a need, a grace, a 
propriety ; and whatever the first may be, it should 
be supplemented at the earliest convenience by a 
copy of that useful book, ' The Lover's Lexicon,' 
with a votive kiss on the 'Constancy' page." In 
which suggestion we heartily concur. 

Society and " The Realm of the Habsburgs " 

politics of the (Lovell, Coryell & Co.) , by Mr. Sid- 
Aush-ian Empire. ney whitman, is a singularly compe- 
tent and acute study of the society and the politics 
of the Austrian Empire. That Empire puzzles the 
casual observer in many ways, and a number of 
writers, headed by the late Professor Freeman, have 
for a long time been somewhat frantically insisting 
that it has no rational right to exist. But it con- 
tinues to exist, although its raison d'etre is thus 
questioned, and that wonderful dynasty of the Habs- 
burgs, with its curious power to adapt itself to the 
age without sacrificing the essentials of its tradition, 
acts as a cohesive element no less surely than the 
race spirit or the centralized political structure of 
other nations. Mr. Whitman's sympathetic sketch 
of the present Emperor helps us to understand much 
of his influence, and to wish that other monarchs 
might have preserved more of the tradition of nob- 
lesse oblige that still shines out in the example of 
the Habsburgs. Such an anecdote as that of his 
telegram to the Holy Father, after the tragic occur-

rence that recently darkened his life, speaks vol- 
umes for his character. The Austrians, in Mr. 
Whitman's account, appear to have preserved, bet- 
ter than their fellow-Europeans, those Old World 
virtues that go far to justify paternalism. Loyalty, 
simplicity of life, the sense of honor, and cheerful 
acquiescence in the order of things, are character- 
istic of few other peoples as they are of present-day 
Austrians. But the author, while bestowing due 
praise for these things, is not sparing in his criti- 
cism of the national faults. Nor does he fail to 
give the necessary prominence to the race-elements 
that make up the composite Empire. The Magyar, 
the Czech, and the German are discussed, each on 
his own account, and the discussion is thus summed 
up : " If the Germans of Austria may be said to 
typify the past, the Slavs a possible future, the Hun- 
garians are, politically and economically at least, 
eminently characteristic of the present day." We 
do not quite understand why Mr. Whitman should 
imply that Berlin, however much more important 
politically, is a more beautiful and impressive cap- 
ital than Vienna. In our opinion, the Danubian 
Kaiserstadt still keeps its ancient prestige, as far as 
outward show is concerned, and the days are by no 
means "gone by when the easy-going Austrians 
were literally justified in singing": 

" 'Sgiebt nur a Kaiserstadt, 
'Sgiebt nur a Wien." 

It is, however, interesting to be reminded that the 
Viennese have themselves recognized the claims of 
the Spree Kaiserstadt by adding a couplet to their 
old song : 

" 'Sgiebt nur a Rauberstadt, 
Und das is Berlin." 

Mr. Whitman's book is one to be read with pleas- 
ure, mingled with regret that he should not have 
worked upon a larger scale. 



Beginnings of the "^h 6 interest that attaches to the skil- 
Engiish Romantic ful treatment of a subject in itself 
uninteresting is aroused by The 
Beginnings of the English Romantic Movement " 
(Ginn), a work by Mr. William Lyon Phelps. This 
book is a study in one of the most arid periods of 
our literature, but is itself redeemed from aridity 
by an exceptionally attractive form of presentation, 
by a discriminating use of texts and authorities, and 
by a scholarship that is accurate without being pe- 
dantic. In preparing the book, the author has gone 
through a course of "desperately dull reading," as 
he hardly needed to assure us, but the result justi- 
fies the pains (certainly to the reader, and we hope 
to the author no less), and every student of English 
literature should be grateful for a piece of work so 
thoroughly well done. The study covers a period 
of over half a century (1700-1765), and seeks to 
trace to its obscure and varied sources the roman- 
ticism that was swelling towards full tide at the 
dawn of the nineteenth century. After a prelim- 
inary examination of romanticism itself, and of the 
Augustan spirit as the soil in which the seed of 



romanticism was sown, Mr. Phelps proceeds to dis- 
cuss the reaction from the couplet form which cul- 
minated in the Spenserian revival (nearly sixty 
Spenserian imitations, from 1706 to 1775, are listed 
in an appendix), the Miltonic influence, the revival 
of interest in medievalism and mythology, and the 
appeal of the old ballad literature to the gradually 
awakening romantic consciousness. A final chap- 
ter is devoted to Gray, and a very striking series 
of extracts illustrates the growth of the romantic 
movement as epitomized in his work. Mr. Phelps 
has taken great care in the matter of dates and like 
minutiae. Incidentally, he corrects a number of 
the blunders of Mr. Gosse ; for that plausible essay- 
ist does not, as Mr. Churton Collins pointed out 
some years ago, err in the direction of an over pe- 
dantic accuracy. An appendix puts together the 
facts, old and new, about the famous ballad of 
" William and Margaret," and constructs an emi- 
nently reasonable theory of the way in which Mal- 
let got for himself the credit of having written it. 

" Stelligeri " is the first one of half- 
*** *y* ** Prewar Bar- 
rett Wendell has collected into a vol- 
ume (Scribner). In the old Harvard catalogues, 
the names of deceased graduates were marked with 
a star. It is of these star-bearers stettigeri, in 
the quaint Latin of the Quinquennial that the in- 
itial essay is written. The other papers are occa- 
sional lectures on American topics. The author is 
entirely right in thinking that the papers possess a 
unity, although they are written on unconnected 
subjects. Lowell as a teacher, Whittier as a poet of 
the Quakers, a new theory about the Salem witches, 
the Puritans, these are some of the themes. The 
essay on American Literature is a remarkably sym- 
pathetic yet dispassionate attempt to decide whether 
we have yet made an independent and permanent 
contribution to English literature. The decision 
probably the decision of every careful student is in 
the negative ; the crucial test being this : " Have we 
lasting expression of the meaning of the past periods 
of American life, in words which have added either 
thought or phrase to the literature of the English 
language ? " Professor Wendell has written a book 
that is pleasant to read. His style is marked by 
careful lucidity, pointedness, and easy movement. 
His clearness is especially admirable when one takes 
into account the difficulties of some of the tasks he 
set himself. It could not have been easy, for in- 
stance, to interpret so plainly the leading traits of 
" Four American Centuries " in terms that should 
be intelligible to a child at school ; and yet it was 
to the school children of Worcester that the address 
was delivered. The writer's phrases are sometimes 
very happy, and his analysis is often marked by 
keen insight. His comments on American humor 
are both apt and searching. It is not profound 
humor, he says ; it is fresh, wholesome, extravagant, 
but " at bottom, after all, extravagance is only an- 
other term for cheerful neglect of stern reality."

Throughout the book there is an intelligent patriot- 
ism that is at once a contrast and an antidote to bla- 
tant spreadeagleism. The volume, indeed, is a con- 
tribution to American patriotism, as well as a dis- 
tinct addition to our none too abundant store of 
true information about ourselves. 



Complete and After a vear?s dela y> thel ; e has a P~ 

beauiifui edition peared, in the Dent edition (Mac- 
oj Landor. millan), the second volume of " The 

Longer Prose Works of Walter Savage Landor." 
This volume completes the edition of Landor for 
which we have given thanks upon several past oc- 
casions. There are six volumes of " Imaginary Con- 
versations," two of poems, and two of the longer prose 
works a practically complete edition of a writer 
who will live as long as the English language, and 
whose audience will increase with every new gener- 
ation. We have previously expressed regret that 
some of Landor's poems should have been left un- 
published, but the new edition, as a whole, includes 
enough matter not collected by Forster to make it 
fully as desirable as its predecessor, while in me- 
chanical attractiveness it easily takes the first place. 
The volume now published gives us a novelty in 
the shape of a frontispiece-portrait of a bearded 
Landor. The text includes the " Pentameron "; five 
additional "Conversations," four of them now for 
the first time reprinted from the " Examiner "; the 
three essays on Theocritus, Catullus, and Petrarca, 
first published in the "Quarterly Review " ; and an 
index. This index, which fills seventy-five pages, 
and covers the ten volumes of the edition, has been 
prepared by Miss Lucy Crump, and its " object has 
been to indicate as far as possible allusions to Lan- 
dor's own life scattered throughout the volumes, and 
to illustrate his opinions." It is difficult to be (in 
words) sufficiently grateful for this intelligent and 
helpful adjunct to the edition. Landor's opinions 
concerning men and things are always interesting 
and often weighty, but his work is of so miscella- 
neous a character that the search for some particular 
but vaguely-remembered allusion is almost a hope- 
less task. From the burden of that task the liter- 
ary worker is henceforth freed. If he wishes to 
know all that Landor wrote of Plato or Dante or 
Milton, of Greece or Italy, of kings or priests or 
religion, he has but to consult this index, which 
promptly reveals to him the volumes and the pages 
to be consulted. Would that such an index might 
accompany the collected works of every writer ! 

Mr. Charles F. Lummis's " The Span- 
Spanith Pioneers igh pi onee rs " (McClurg) is a con- 

tn Amerwa. . ? i 

cise popular narrative, based on re- 
cent historical investigation, of the part borne by 
Spain in American discovery and exploration. All 
will probably agree with Mr. Luinmis that our his- 
tories and text-books have not sufficiently empha- 
sized the importance of Spanish pioneering in the 
New World. Yet we cannot but think that he has 
been led by his love of fair play to overrate, if not 



the valor and endurance, at least the character and 
motives of the Spanish leaders men with whom 
gold-hunting, not colonization or the advancement 
of knowledge, was the predominant impulse, and 
the record of whose treatment of the native races 
we must still regard as one of the blackest chapters 
in the annals of man's inhumanity to man. Co- 
lumbus was, to quote from a recent brilliant mono- 
graph on American history, "the father of a line 
of adventurers who, like himself, were gold-seekers 
or seekers of lucre, gilding their rapacity with the 
same profession of zeal for the extension of relig- 
ion, who sacked Mexico and Peru, trampled to 
pieces there, under the hoofs of conquest, the high- 
est development of Indian civilization, worked to 
death the soft inhabitants of the American islands, 
and replaced them by the importation of African 
slaves. None of these adventurers looked upon 
America as a new home, or thought of founding a 
nation." The deductions indicated being made, Mr. 
Lummis's work will be found as accurate and in- 
forming as it is readable ; and the style, barring a 
slightly declamatory and dogmatic tone at the out- 
set, is suitable and agreeable. For those seeking 
a compact popular manual embodying the latest con- 
clusions on the subject treated, we can point to no 
better book. 

Mr. W. J. Linton's biography of 
y Whittier in the "Great Writers Se- 
ries" (Scribner), reads like a labor 
of love. There can be no doubt as to the author's 
admiration for his subject. The familiar story of 
the poet's life the boyhood on the farm, the first 
attempts at literature, the devotion to the abolitionist 
cause, the part played during war-time, the long and 
revered old age, all this is well told and well in- 
terpreted. The poetical history is accompanied by 
a running comment on the poems themselves, and 
special stress is laid on certain interesting points 
among other things, on the influence of the New 
England landscape in moulding Whittier's genius. 
The literary criticism is earnest and straightfor- 
ward independent rather than original. Mr. Lin- 
ton's forcible depreciation of Poe when compared 
with Whittier readily suggests our writer's point of 
view. It is uncatholic. Whittier, assuredly, can 
be praised, and to no man's detriment. In summing 
up his critical opinions, Mr. Linton discards orig- 
inality altogether, and quotes page after page from 
other writers. The last two chapters are little more 
than a compilation of the critical estimates of Stod-

(Century Co.), by Miss Margaret 
Symonds, daughter of the late J. 
Addington Symonds, is a very charming piece of 
descriptive writing. The Doge's Farm is situated 
at Vescovano, near the east of the great Lombard 
plain, and in the shadow of the Euganean hills. It 
is an estate that has for centuries been in possession

THE DIAL

of the Pisani family, and is now owned and man- 
aged by the English widow of a Pisani who died 
many years ago. Upon this estate Miss Symonds 
has been repeatedly a guest, and her book gives a 
simple and graceful account of everyday life at Ves- 
covano, of the country-people and their ways, and 
of the untiring energy of the Englishwoman who 
has made a garden out of a desert, and who per- 
sonally directs, to the minutest detail, the affairs of 
her little kingdom. The book tells us of village 
festivals and of mountain excursions, of life indoors 
and out, and of the various operations of agricul- 
ture, from ploughing to harvest. In this latter con- 
nection, Miss Symonds pays a worthy tribute to the 
magnificent Lombard oxen, whose gray and digni- 
fied forms are so characteristic of the landscape, 
whom Carducci celebrated in his " T'amo, pio bove," 
and whom the traveller always remembers, whatever 
else he may forget. Miss Symonds has illustrated 
her book by many sketches, and she draws as well 
as she writes. In both cases she has an eye for 
the essentials, and the quality of the picturesque 
appears no less in her literary than in her graphic 
manner. 

General Strong in 1850 was first 
brought into contact with the Indians 
of the Pacific Coast, and for six years 
thereafter he " travelled with and among them." 
The interest thus aroused in the native Americans 
has continued, and now shows itself in the book en- 
titled " Wah-kee-nah and her People " (Putnam). 
Wahkeenah is a Yakima girl whose story the author 
relates. On one occasion she saved him from dan- 
ger of death. Knowing the Indians intimately, he 
loves them, and desires to present their cause from 
their point of view. He finds the Indian, when first 
brought into contact with the white man, ever kind, 
just, hospitable ; only after he has suffered wrongs 
does he become warlike, treacherous, revengeful. 
Starting with this idea, the author passes the vari- 
ous groups of tribes in review, sketching their daily 
life, their character, their grievances. The book, 
although not critical or scientific, will interest, per- 
haps instruct. - 

Mr. J. B. Bury's History of the 
Roman Empire from its Foundation 
to the D eatn of Marcus Aurelius," 
just issued in Harper's Student's Series, is devoted 
to a period of which there has hitherto existed no 
compact and scholarly account in English. Mr. 
Bury's book is useful and in many respects excel- 
lent. Its author knows at first hand the most im- 
portant original sources, and has made himself ac- 
quainted with the views of the principal modern 
writers on the field he traverses. He has a clear 
apprehension of the significance of the period, and 
sees its relations to the earlier and later history 
of Rome. His judgment is in the main sound, and 
he has an evident desire to be fair to the emperors 
and the imperial system. Unfortunately, these mer- 
its are obscured by an abrupt and unattractive style. 



of the Roman 
Empire. 



The facts are set forth clearly and concisely, but 
they are not combined so as to arouse interest or 
always to leave a definite and lasting impression 
on the reader's mind. 



"The Humor of Holland " (imported 
.. b y Sc'ibner), Volume V. in the Li- 

brary of Humor " series, is an amus- 
ing number, and it has the special merit of taking 
us into a comparatively new field. In the matter 
of broad, homely fun, the writers of Holland seem 
to be no whit behind her jovial painters Jan Steen, 
Teniers, Brouwer, and the rest. It is indeed sin- 
gular that men who live on cabbage and wear six 
pairs of breeches should be capable of wit ; but the 
ways of nature are inscrutable. The volume is fur- 
nished with a critical introduction by the translator, 
A. Werner, and there are amusing sketches by Dud- 
ley Hardy and others. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A new edition of Bayard Taylor's " History of Ger- 
many " (Appleton) comes to us, with an additional 
chapter by Mrs. Taylor, and a portrait of the German 
Emperor. The new chapter is brief, and the work re- 
mains substantially as it came from the hands of its 
author. It is, we need hardly say, an excellent book 
both for school purposes and for the general reader. 
Mrs. Taylor's additions have been based mainly upon 
Professor Muller's " Politische Geschichte der Gegen- 
wart." 

Mr. Walter Crane's Eight Illustrations to Shake- 
speare's ' Tempest ' " (Copeland & Day) are published 
in an edition limited to 650 copies, each signed by the 
artist. Mr. Crane's designs have been engraved in fac- 
simile by Mr. Duncan C. Dallas, and the effect is highly 
satisfactory. The plates are not bound, but each is 
printed upon Japanese paper, mounted and framed in a 
mat. A neat box comes with them. Mr. Crane's draw- 
ings are always interesting, and these examples of his 
work are strongly characteristic both of his manner and 
his mannerisms. 

Mr. Justin Huntly McCarthy has translated nearly 
a hundred and fifty " Ghazels from the Divan of Hafiz " 
(Imported by Scribner) into English prose, and pleas- 
antly dedicated the volume to Mr. W. E. Henley. 
Prose translations are well, even from the Persian, but 
it is hard to put up with 1 them after FitzGerald and all 
the others who have delved in the riches of the East, 
and have really given us poetry for poetry. But Mr. 
McCarthy's work is pleasing, and has clearly been a 
labor of love. 

There is considerable contemporary history, especially 
of Turkey and the Balkan States, in Mrs. Latimer's 
compilation about "Russia and Turkey in the Nine- 
teenth Century " (McClurg), and the work may be found 
useful for reference to recent events. It has been 
largely prepared by means of the scissors and the paste- 
pot, but the writer contrives to put her material to- 
gether in an attractive way, and has made a fairly con- 
tinuous narrative. A number of portraits, from Madame 
de Krudener to Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria, add ma- 
terially to the interest of the book.

[March 16, 



" Lewis Carroll " has just published " Sylvie and 
Bruno Concluded " (Macmillan) in a volume illustrated, 
as was its predecessor, by Mr. Harry Furniss. Since 
the author informs us that he never reads the published 
criticisms of his writings, he, at least, will bear us no 
grudge for saying that the new volume is far from being 
worthy of the best writer of nonsense in the English 
language. In spite of such verses as, 

" He thought he saw an Argument 
That proved he was the Pope : 
He looked again and found it was 
A bar of mottled soap. 
' A fact so dread,' he faintly said, 
' Extinguishes all hope I '" 

which occasionally enliven the pages, there is a sad de- 
cline from the story of Alice, and even from the first 
volume of the work now concluded. We imagine it will 
be caviare to most children, and will find its most inter- 
ested readers among adults. 

" The Building of the City Beautiful " is a rhapso- 
dical prose romance by Mr. Joaquin Miller, published 
in very tasteful shape by Messrs. Stone & Kimball. 
But our spirits are a little dashed at finding upon the 
first page of the text one of the most familiar of Mat- 
thew Arnold's stanzas reprinted with no less than three 
mistakes. The author provides the other chapters with 
headings from his own verse, which he may misquote as 
much as he pleases, but we object to having a great 
poet treated in this fashion. 

Recent publications of the State Historical Society 
of Wisconsin are " A Brief History of the Elective Fran- 
chise in Wisconsin," by Miss Florence Elizabeth Baker ; 
" The Financial History of Wisconsin Territory," by Mr. 
Matthew Brown Hammond ; and " The Significance of 
the Frontier in American History," by Professor Fred- 
erick J. Turner. We have also received a syllabus of 
a course of six University Extension lectures on " The 
Making of Wisconsin," by Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites. 
This syllabus illustrates an excellent sort of work in lo- 
cal history that might profitably be undertaken in every 
State of the Union. Our people know far too little, as 
a rule, of the history of their own States, and anything 
calling closer attention to the subject deserves com- 
mendation. 

Three numbers of " Indiana Historical Society Pub- 
lications " (Bowen-Merrill) are before us. The first is 
an " oration for the Columbian year " on the subject of 
" The Man in History," by Mr. John Clark Ridpath. 
It is rhetorical, after the manner of orations, but not 
without interest. Another of these pamphlets is called 
"Ouiatanon: A Study in Indiana History," and is by 
Professor Oscar J. Craig. It gives the story of the 
ancient trading-post named in the title. " Reminiscences 
of a Journey to Indianapolis in the Year 1836," by Judge 
C. P. Ferguson; and a "Life of Liba Foote," by Mr. 
Samuel Morrison, make up the contents of the third of 
these pamphlets. 

"Historic Green Bay, 1634-1840," by Ella Hoes 
Neville, Sarah Greene Martin, and Deborah Beaumont 
Martin, a neatly-appointed volume of 224 pages, con- 
tains "the history of Green Bay from its earliest days 
until the organization of Wisconsin as a territory." The 
little book is soberly and intelligently written, and the 
authors have evidently taken due pains to make it ac- 
curate and full. There are maps and illustrations, and 
a commendatory Preface is furnished by Mr. Reuben 
Gold Thwaites, Secretary of the Wisconsin State Hist- 
orical Society. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS. 



The books to be issued this Spring by American pub- 
lishers are given below in the usual carefully arranged 
and classified summary which has become a regular 
semi-annual feature of THE DIAL. It is to be noted 
that books already issued and received are not here an- 
nounced, they being entered, instead, in the List of New 
Books on page 195; hence both lists are to be included 
in a survey of the products and activities of the pub- 
lishing season. This survey will be a matter of peculiar 
interest at this time of general commercial depression. 
It is somewhat surprising to find that instead of show- 
ing a falling off as compared with previous years, the 
present list is considerably longer than that of a year 
ago, which was the most extensive Spring list we have 
ever published. There is shown also, we think, an ad- 
vance as regards the general interest and importance of 
the works included. From a trade standpoint, the list 
is of marked significance, exhibiting as it does the pre- 
dominance of a few old and strong houses, while many 
of the smaller and newer houses are but slightly rep- 
resented, and some of the more sensational houses are 
not represented at all. The publishing trade as a whole, 
however, is certainly to be congratulated on showing so 
few signs of the prevailing business depression.

YORK TOPICS. 



New York, March 9, 1894. 

Eighteen of the thirty parts of " The Art of the World 
Illustrated in the Paintings, Statuary, and Architecture 
of the Columbian Exposition," published by Messrs. D. 
Appleton & Co., have now appeared, and all who have 
seen them have had an opportunity to judge of the 
work's success as an aesthetic undertaking. The names 
of the official contributors to the descriptive text, Pro- 
fessor Ives, Director Burnham, and others, are well 
known to THE DIAL'S readers. That of Mr. Ripley 
Hitchcock, who has designed and edited the work, 
may not be so well known to some of them, and it 
seems desirable to give a little synopsis of his life and 
work. 

Ripley Hitchcock is the son of the late Dr. Alfred 
Hitchcock, a distinguished physician of Fitchburg, 
Mass., and was born in that city. He graduated at 
Harvard in 1877, and, his interest having already turned 
to the fine arts, he remained at Cambridge for a grad- 
uate course under the direction of Prof. Charles Eliot 
Norton. Removing to New York, he soon began to 
write, and after filling minor positions on the " Trib- 
une " he in 1882 became art critic of that paper. From 
this time on he became identified with the art movement 
in his adopted city. He has not, however, confined him- 
self exclusively to art-criticism in his writings. Much 
of his summers has been spent in travelling through 
all parts of North America, and these journeyings have 
resulted in many descriptive articles. He has also writ- 
ten a good deal about out-door life and sports. It was 
in 1885 that the " Century Magazine " commissioned 
Mr. Hitchcock to visit the Western cities of the country, 
and report upon art conditions as he found them. His 
" The Western Art Movement " was the result of this 
trip, and proved to be a revelation of the progress of the 
fine arts in the West. This work was translated and 
republished in L'Art. Besides his earliest and his latest 
works, Mr. Hitchcock has published " Etchings in Amer- 
ica," " A Study of George Inness," " American Water 
Color Painting," and several kindred volumes. In 1890 
he resigned his position on the " Tribune " to accept that 
of literary adviser to the firm of Messrs. Appleton & 
Co., and since that time has been manager of this firm's 
departments relative to the acceptance and publication 
of books. 

Messrs. Appleton & Co. publish next week the " Life 
of Edward L. Youmans," by Prof. John Fiske, a book 
which will at once find its way to every library in the 
United States pretending to a department of science. 
The extracts from Professor Tyndall's letters to Pro- 
fessor Youmans, printed in THE DIAL just after the 
former's death, were taken from this volume. As foun- 
der and editor of the " Popular Science Monthly " and 
originator of the " International Science Series," Pro- 
fessor Youmans was almost the first in this country to 
bring science to the knowledge of the masses. For 
many years the professor and his talented wife, who has 
survived him, were conspicuous figures in the limited 
literary circles of New York, and naturally his personal 
presence and social abilities are greatly missed by those 
who knew him. He was succeeded as editor of the 
" Popular Science Monthly " by his brother, Mr. William 
Jay Youmans, the present editor. 

That charming Arcadian, Ernest Rhys, who came over 
from England a few years ago, and lectured in a quiet 
way on literary subjects new and old in Boston, New 



York, and other Eastern cities, may not have carried 
back with him so many American dollars as some of the 
gentlemen who have since visited us under the expan- 
sive auspices of the veteran manager, Major Pond, but he 
entered the houses of most of our (really) " best peo- 
ple," and made numerous warm friends. These will be 
interested to learn that having married and settled down 
in Hampstead Vale, in the northwest of London, Mr. 
Rhys is meditating various literary ventures, some of 
which are approaching completion. His first volume 
of poems is already announced for publication, " A Lon- 
don Rose, and Other Rhymes," which will be brought 
out in all the luxury of printing and binding which per- 
tains to the house of Elkin Mathews and John Lane. 
Besides a little cycle of London poems, a love sequence, 
etc., Mr. Rhys's volume will contain some rhymes and 
ballads of Wales, in which he has made some new ex- 
periments with Kymric measures in English verse. Of 
the limited edition one hundred and fifty copies are in- 
tended for the American market. Mr. Rhys, it will be 
recalled, is the editor of the " Camelot Classics " series. 
I remember his telling me that he belonged to a little 
London society, yclept " The Rhymesters," the members 
of which met every week and were obliged to produce 
a poem on a given subject, and how he planned an un- 
pleasant " impromptu " surprise for them one evening 
in the shape of a stinging satire on their alleged " smug- 
ness," and how they rose up as one man and drove him 
out into the rain, hatless and umbrellaless, to find his 
way home as best he could. 

There is just such a club in Philadelphia, called " The 
Pegasus," whose members have periodical meetings for 
the same purposes. One of these gentlemen, Mr. Har- 
rison S. Morris, the poet, was recently invited to lecture 
before the Browning Society of Boston. Mr. Morris is 
himself a member of the Philadelphia Browning Society, 
but he has a realizing sense of the master's occasional 
failings. So he treated his audience to what the Boston 
papers styled a " scathing analysis " of " A Blot on the 
'Scutcheon," and stirred up considerable discussion 
thereby, doubtless to the benefit of the down-east dilet- 
tanti. Oddly enough, I saw not long since an announce- 
ment of Mr. Morris's first volume of poems, to be brought 
out by the Lippincotts in dainty style next fall. So these 
two young Arcadians seem to have much in common, 
though so widely separated. 

Mr. Paul Leicester Ford has varied his labors on the 
Putnam edition of Jefferson's writings, now going 
through the press, with the editing of a new and, as far 
as possible, complete edition of the writings of John 
Dickinson, the " Penman of the Revolution." The work, 
in three volumes, will be published by the Historical 
Society of Pennsylvania. Two volumes will contain the 
political writings, and a third will be devoted to Dick- 
inson's correspondence, which, with many political papers 
now first collected, has been gotten together by Mr. 
Ford during five years of research. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker, who has been visiting us, has writ- 
ten from Mexico announcing his safe arrival in that city, 
and his intention of returning to New York by way of 
Havana and Florida. I learn from Messrs. Stone and 
Kimball, of Chicago and Cambridge, that Mr. Parker's 
fine sonnet-sequence, "A Lover's Diary," which I had 
the good fortune to see in manuscript, will soon be out. 
Messrs. Appleton & Co. have announced his new novel, 
" The Trespasser," for the last of March.

TjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 



Messrs. Gopeland & Day will soon publish a volume 
of " Vagabond Poems," by Mr. Bliss Carman and Mr. 
Richard Hovey. 

"The Bookman" makes the astonishing statement 
that no book of Mr. Ruskin has ever been translated and 
published in a foreign language. 

" La Patrie," a French Canadian paper, has recently 
been threatened with the ban of the church for announc- 
ing "Monte Cristo" as a feuilleton. 

Mr. Evelyn Abbott, a Fellow of Balliol College, and 
well known as the author of a history of Greece, will 
prepare the biography of the late Benjamin Jowett. 

Colonel T. W. Higginson has nearly completed his 
" Military and Naval History of Massachusetts," writ- 
ten under appointment from the Governor of the State. 

A good story is told by Alphonse Daudet, illustrating 
the attitude of the French Academy toward him. " It 
often happens," he says, "that letters from foreign 
countries are addressed to me at the French Academy, 
in the supposition that I am one of its members. These 
letters are almost always returned to the post office with 
the remark, ' Unknown to the French Academy,' writ- 
ten on the envelope. There is no harm in this, since the 
post office knows where to send my correspondence. But 
the formula is droll. I have often given evidence of its 
authenticity." 

Messrs. Stone and Kimball make the very important 
announcement of a complete edition of Poe, in ten vol- 
umes, with critical introductions to the several works 
by Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman, and a biography by 
Professor George E. Woodberry. It gratifies one's 
sense of the eternal fitness of things that just these two 
men should have agreed to cooperate in the production 
of this edition. There will be a portrait and fac-simile 
illustrations, and, in the case of the large-paper edition, 
eight drawings by Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. There never 
has been even a respectable edition of Po, but the one 
now promised is likely to be everything that could be 
desired. 

Reference has already been made in these columns 
to the fine bronze monument provided by Mr. George M. 
Pullman to commemorate the Chicago Massacre of 1812, 
and erected on the site of that historic incident the 
lake shore at Eighteenth street. The monument was 
formally unveiled in June last; and an account of the 
ceremonies has, very appropriately, been published by 
the Chicago Historical Society, to whose charge the 
monument was transferred by Mr. Pullman. The most 
important feature of the volume is the address of Mr. 
E. G. Mason, the President of the Society. It is a care- 
fully-studied and spirited account, in small compass, of 
the tragic occurrence and the causes that led to it. The 
volume contains, also, the address of ex-President Har- 
rison, delivered on the same occasion ; and there are 
some excellent views of the monument in photogravure. 
The new Chaucer, upon which Professor W. W. Skeat 
has been at work for twenty-five years, will be published 
in six volumes, to appear in rapid succession during the 
present year. The work represents the unremitting 
labor of a quarter of a century. It is a complete edi- 
tion of all the genuine works of Chaucer, whether in 
prose or poetry. It contains an entirely new text, 
founded upon the best manuscripts and the earliest 
printed editions. It is the first modern edition (not 
counting mere reprints from the old black-letter copies) 



which contains the whole of Chaucer's works. Various 
readings are recorded wherever they have any interest 
or value. The requirements of metre and grammar 
have been carefully considered throughout. Besides 
these, the phonology and spelling of every word have 
received particular attention, the spelling being, in fact, 
a fair guide to the true old pronunciation. The present 
edition is therefore the first that adequately represents 
the author's words. A complete commentary accom- 
panies the whole, in which Chaucer's indebtedness to 
Boccaccio, Statius, Ovid, Boethius, etc., is duly pointed 
out. In the notes every difficulty has been considered. 
The glossary is of exceptional fulness ; and all necessary 
indexes are appended. The English price of the vol- 
umes is fixed at sixteen shillings each, but subscriptions 
for the set, with advance payment, may be made for 
three guineas. 

The American Folk-Lore Society is about to under- 
take an extensive scheme of publication, under the name 
of "Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society." 
The first volume of this series, to be published in March, 
will be "Folk-Tales of Angola," by M. Heli Chatelain. 
The work, which, together with an explanatory intro- 
duction, will give in original text and literal translation 
the oral literature of the West African Coast, will be 
the first published representation of the ideas, emo- 
tions, and moral sentiments of races from which has 
been derived a great part of the negro population of 
the Southern States, and will therefore have an im- 
portant bearing on American history. Among other 
works intended to continue the series are collections of 
the French Creole tales of Louisiana, and of the Cur- 
rent Superstitions still found in great mass among the 
English-speaking population. Persons interested in the 
work of the Society will gladly be received as mem- 
bers, the annual fee being three dollars, giving the right 
to a copy of the organ of the Society, the " Journal of 
American Folk-Lore " (quarterly). A subscription of 
ten dollars to the publication fund will include the 
membership fee, and entitle the subscriber to all the 
publications of the Society, including the Memoirs, of 
which it is proposed to issue several numbers annually. 
Persons wishing to become members, or subscribe to the 
publication fund, should address the permanent secre- 
tary, Mr. W. W. Newell, Cambridge, Mass. 

A NEW STORY OF PROFESSOR JOWETT. 

Prof. N. M. Butler, in " The Educational Review," 
tells the following story of Professor Jowett: "A few 
years ago he was one of those who extended an invita- 
tion to the Extension students to meet at Oxford. De- 
siring to find lodgings for some of them at Balliol Col- 
lege, he suggested to the dons that it would be a grace- 
ful thing for them to vacate their rooms for a fortnight, 
and allow him to assign the rooms thus set free to the 
visitors. The dons demurred, looking upon such a prop- 
osition as an invasion of their ancient and honorable 
privileges. The Master, however, had other weapons 
at his disposal besides persuasion. He had sole control 
of the chapel services and of the buttery. The former 
he lengthened very considerably, and the resources of 
the latter were reduced to the lowest ebb by his con- 
nivance. This policy had the desired effect, and the 
dons began to leave town for a holiday. As the last of 
them disappeared in the direction of the railway station, 
weighed down with hand-luggage, the Master rubbed 
his hands and said: 'This kind goeth not out but by 
prayer and fasting.' "

seventh of last month, was a woman of rare character 
and accomplishments. She was the daughter of Mr. 
Fernando Jones, one of the earlier among the Chicago 
settlers. Much of her life was spent abroad, and few 
women have compassed so varied a social experience 
within so brief a term of years. Her acquaintance with 
people of literary, artistic, and other sorts of distinction, 
in England, France, and Italy, as well as in this country, 
was extraordinary in its range. She was the founder of 
the Twentieth Century Club of Chicago, and acted as its 
secretary from its beginning in 1889 to the time of her 
death. She was an occasional contributor to THE DIAL, 
one of her articles being a review of the " Journal " of 
Marie Bashkirtseff, made particularly interesting by the 
fact of her acquaintance with the young Russian artist. 
Her literary work was of a fugitive sort, and but the 
earnest of what she might have accomplished had she 
lived. As it is, she will live chiefly in the memory of 
her many friends, but they will not easily forget her 
winsome disposition, her bright clear intelligence, or the 
never-failing charm of her presence and her conversa- 
tion. 

BLESSING A NEWSPAPER ESTABLISHMENT. 

The office of " The Triluvian," a newspaper published 
at Trois Rivieres, in Lower Canada, has recently been 
blessed in regular form by the authorities of the Church. 
The ceremony is thus described by the paper concerned: 
" His installation being almost completed and the re- 
pairs which he had to make to our establishment being 
ended, our proprietor, Mr. P. V. Ayotte, like a man 
careful of his responsibilities, and being conscious of his 
duties as a master who believes and acts accordingly, 
invited his Grace of Three Rivers to come and bless 
his different workshops. Monsignor acceded with good 
grace to the desire, and, with that perpetual goodness 
which tempers the austerity of his life and the author- 
ity of his word, he called us together all around him in 
the editorial office of this paper. Monsignor, who was 
accompanied by Canon Cloutier, cure" of the cathedral, 
after having recited the customary prayers, made the 
tour of the different departments, which he blessed 
while he said the ' Miserere.' " The idea is a good one, 
although our own newspapers would not take to it 
kindly. To be " blessed " is the last thing that most of 
them would wish for. 

A WORD FROM MR. BESANT ON CHICAGO AND THE WEST. 

Mr. Walter Besant, writing in the London " Author," 
makes the following comment apropos of our recent effort 
to secure the free importation of English books : " THE 
DIAL of Chicago has made an attempt to ' enlist the 
friends of culture, irrespective of party, in an effort to 
secure the removal' from the United States tariff law 
of the duty on books in the English language. The 
editor sent round in various directions a large number 
of blank petitions, which were filled with signatures and 
presented to the House of Representatives. It must be 
remembered that this kind of work is far more arduous 
than it would be in this country on account of the great 
distances, and the difference in the .average of culture 
in the several States. For instance, not to be invidious, 
no one would expect in Texas the same intellectual stan- 
dards as in Massachusetts. The result of the petitions 
is not yet apparent ; probably they were only expected 
to clear the way for another and a bolder attack. It is, 
however, remarkable though not astonishing that this 
movement should originate in Chicago. We may look 



I firmly believe to the West, of which Chicago is 
the natural centre, for many great things in literature 
and in art. The youth and vigor of the place; the suc- 
cess of the place ; the resolve of the young men and 
maidens to achieve what can be achieved by study and 
effort ; the wealth of the place, which secures all that 
can be obtained in learning and teaching; even the sep- 
aration of the place from the old continuity of English 
literature; the things that have already come from the 
place all lead me to look on Chicago as a centre of 
literature and art in the immediate future." 



BALLADE OF MAISTRE FRANCOYS RABELAIS. 

The following "ballade," by Mr. Showell Rogers, is 
reprinted from the London " Author." 

" Over a jolly chapter of Rabelais." 

R. BROWNING, in "Garden Fancies." 

" Come down, old friend ; too long you've lain 

On yon high shelf. You're dusty ? Phew ! 
Certes, I hear you answer plain, 
' A judgment for neglect, pardieu ! ' 
Ne'er fear, you'll always get your due, 
Tho' times go not the easy way, 

When lusty clerics gave the cue ; 
Eh ? Master Francois Rabelais ? 

" Fair abbey gardens of Touraine 

Long spoil'd, bloom in your page anew ; 
Old France unrolls her wide champaign 

For great Gargantua's jovial crew, 

Sly Panurge, Pantagruel too, 
And proud Thelema's mad array : 

Their legend ' What thou Wilt, that Doe ' 
Yours, Master Francois Rabelais. 

" And tho' you seek your shelf again, 

Happier with dusty tomes than new, | 1 j%&l 
Know this : whate'er new lights may reign,^ 

You'll find fit company tho' few. 

Tho' prudes with pain your volumes view, 
Whate'er folk unco' guid may say, 

The world will have its laughter through 
With Master Frangois Rabelais. 

Envoy. 
" Doctor, Franciscan, tho' tis true 

Bookmen have all, like dogs, their day ; 
Long lease of life belongs to you, 
Good Master Francois Rabelais." 



MR. GOLDWIN SMITH ON A " SCHOOL OF ENGLISH 
LITERATURE." 

Professor Goldwin Smith comments upon the new 
Oxford School of English Literature in the following 
not over-enthusiastic terms: " The last new project is 
a School of English Literature. In English literature 
are included, we must presume, all the great English 
writers, grave or gay. What is to give shape or sub- 
stance to such a school ? Is Anglo-Saxon to be its 
backbone ? Anglo-Saxon is a proper subject for the pro- 
fessorial chair, which is at present most worthily filled, 
but as a general study it is meagre, having for peo- 
ple in general little more than an etymological value, 
nor does it seem likely to be effective in the way of 
intellectual training. It was said by a Member of Con- 
gregation that the School of English Literature would 
be, in the American phrase, 'a soft option.' But Ox- 
ford dreads unpopularity and the imputation of being 
behind the age. This is partly the nemesis of her op- 
position to progress in her Tory and High Church days. 
The cat was probably let out of the bag by the Mem- 
ber of Congregation who advocated the creation of the 
school in the interest of ' the ladies.' "

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 1894. 



QINN AND COMPANY PUBLISH : 



The Athenaeum Press Series. 

This series is intended to furnish a library of the best English literature from Chaucer to the present time, in a 
form adapted to the needs of both the student and the general reader. The works selected are carefully 
edited, with biographical and critical introductions, full explanatory notes, and other necessary apparatus. 
Already issued: Sidney's "Defense of Poesy," edited by Albert S. Cook of Yale, Jonson's "Timber," edited 

by Felix E. Schelling of Yale University, and " The Essays of Jeffrey," edited by Lewis E. Gates of Harvard 

University. 

The Classic Myths in English Literature. 

Based chiefly on Bulfinch's Age of Fable. Accompanied by an Interpretative and Illustrative Commentary. 

Edited by CHARLES MILLS GAYLEY, Professor of the English Language and Literature in the University of 

California. 12mo, cloth, xxviii-539 pages. $1.65. 

The work is elaborately illustrated with a large number of specially prepared new cuts and reproductions from 
the antique and from recent authoritative publications. The whole M^>rk will be found eminently satisfactory from 
both the literary and artistic points of view, and as a manual* of ready reference, being elaborately indexed, will 
prove itself invaluable. 

Albert S. Cook, Professor of the English Language and Literature, Yale University : It is scholarly, attractive, stimulat- 
ing, and refining. The quotations, and the detailed references to English literature, contribute much to the value of the book, 
and will make it seem indispensable to many who are familiar with the myths themselves. 

Dante Handbook. 

By GIOVANNI A. SCARTAZZINI. Translated from the Italian, with Notes and Additions, by THOMAS 

DAVIDSON, M.A. 12mo, cloth, xii-315 pages. $1.25. 

This Handbook, written by the first of living Dante scholars, contains everything necessary to enable the stu- 
dent to study intelligently the supreme Christian poet "The voice of ten silent centuries." It is divided into 
two parts, the first treating of Dante's Life, the second of his works. To every section is appended a valuable 
Bibliography. 

L. Clark Seelye, President of Smith College : It seems to me to meet a real need of both teachers and students of Dante. 
The notes by Mr. Davidson add much to the value of the book. 



The Psychic Factors of Civilization. 

By LESTER F. WARD. 8vo, cloth, xxi-369 pages. $2.00. 

This book is a new presentation of the whole subject of 
social progress, written from a scientific standpoint, but in a 
popular style, and carrying the reader from the most funda- 
mental principles up to their application to the living issues 
of the times. MIND, instead of brute force, is made the basis 
of political economy. 

Public Opinion : It bears a fundamental relation to the great social 
problems that are now forcing themselves on public attention, and no 
one who would properly prepare himself adequately to grapple with 
these problems can afford to neglect Professor Ward's latest contribu- 
tion to the elucidation of their underlying principles. 

The Mark in Europe and America. 

A REVIEW OF THE DISCUSSION OF EARLY LAND TENURE. 
By ENOCH A. BRYAN, President of Washington State Agri- 
cultural College. 12mo, cloth, vii-164 pages. $1.10. 
This book will appeal to all who are interested in any of 
those sociological questions which are connected with the his- 
tory of land-holding, and especially to teachers and students 
of history and economics. 

Boston Herald : This work is a good summing up of writings dealing 
with the subject, and also contains much matter tending to explode 
certain theories which are very attractive, but which lack authentic 
data to prove them. 



Handbook of Historic Schools of Painting. 

By Miss DERISTHE L. HOYT, Instructor in the Massachusetts 
Normal Art School. 12mo, cloth, 210 pages. $1.00. 

This book gives in a concise and systematic manner the most 
important facts regarding the principal schools of painting, 
both ancient and modern, the most noteworthy masters, and 
the most celebrated pictures, with many other points that 
every well-informed person desires to know. 

Unity, Chicago : It deals with facts, not criticism, yet its groups of 
characteristics of the various schools are clear and strong. 

Footprints of Travel ; 
or, Journeyings in Many Lands. 

By MATURIN M. BALLOU, author of "Due West," "Due 

East," "Due North," "Under the Southern Cross," etc. 

Illustrated, 12mo, cloth, 370 pages, $1.10 ; boards, 80 cts. 

In this book the author depicts foreign countries and fa- 
mous cities, describing land and ocean travel all over the 
world ; and yet he writes of no islands, continents, or seas, no 
remarkable monuments or interesting localities, which he has 
not personally visited. 

N. Y. Independent : It is compact, rapid, and sketchy, but written 
in a good and spirited style. 



* Any of these publications will be sent by mail, postpaid, on receipt of the prices given above.

A History of the United 
States Navy. 

From 1775 to 1894. By EDGAR ST ANTON M ACL AY, 
A.M. With Technical Revision by Lieut. ROY C. 
SMITH, U. S. N. In two volumes. Vol. I. With 
numerous Maps, Diagrams, and Illustrations. 8vo, 
cloth; price, $3.50 per volume. 

For nine years the author has devoted himself to the task 
of supplying the want of a complete history of our navy. His 
researches in France, with the assistance of Admiral Aube, 
Minister of the Colonies and the Marine, and in England with 
the aid of the late Sir Provo Wallis and others, together with 
the use of private papers and unpublished documents in this 
country, the aid of descendants of naval heroes, and the sug- 
gestions of naval officers who have taken part in some of the 
events described, render the results of his diligent labor com- 
plete and authoritative. The appearance of a standard his- 
tory of the navy is a peculiarly happy accompaniment of the 
development of our new navy. 

(Vol. II. will be published next month.) 

Symbolic Education. 

By SUSAN E. BLOW. Volume 26, International Edu- 
cation Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.

the philosophy of Froebel as found in "The Mothers' Songs 
and Games " Mutterund Koselieder and shows in a clear 
manner the significance of the kindergarten and its claims for 
the important place of corner stone of education. It is em- 
phatically a book for mothers as well as for teachers, as it 
gives the desired aid and interpretation of the actions, feel- 
ings, and thoughts of infancy, and unfolds the true method 
of training as taught by Froebel.

large one to cover, and the author does not claim that he has omitted 
nothing. Bnt he has put a great deal of exceedingly useful material 
into 520 pages, and has condensed his matter so intelligently that no 
space is wasted." Chicago Tribune.

With 23 illustrations. 12rao, cloth, $1.00. 
" It is practically only within the present century that any exact 
knowledge has been obtained of the deep sea fauna. . . . This volume 
is an admirable report of what has been so far discovered. ... It is 
a very fascinating subject which Mr. Hickson deals with in his scholarly 
little book." Boston Herald.

Stories from Life. By SARAH GRAXD, author of " The 
Heavenly Twins," " Ideala," etc. No. 136, Town and 
Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, with 
portrait of author, $1.00. 

In these stories the author of ' ' The Heavenly Twins ' ' shows 
some of her strongest and most impressive work. The great 
number of readers who have been charmed with her previous 
books will not fail to discern in this new volume the qualities 
which have gained for her such prompt and widespread rec- 
ognition. 

A Costly Freak. 

By MAXWELL GRAY, author of " The Silence of Dean 
Maitland," " An Innocent Impostor," etc. No. 137, 
Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; 
cloth, $1.00. 

This story demonstrates that the author's power to hold 
her readers' closest attention has not diminished since the ap- 
pearance of " The Silence of Dean Maitland." It is a novel 
which compares more nearly to that remarkable book than 
does any other of her writings.

THE APPROACH TO LITERATURE. 

An excellent educational method, much in 
vogue among the more progressive of modern 
teachers, is based upon the principle of pro- 
ceeding from the near and the familiar to the 
strange and the remote. It is a method that 
may be pushed to extremes, but it is funda- 
mentally sound. In geography, for example, 
a child starts with the schoolhouse, the village, 
and the surrounding country made familiar by 
his wanderings, and afterwards extends to 
scenes unvisited the construction thus begun. 
In history, the happenings of the day, as nar- 
rated in the newspapers and talked about by 
his acquaintances, provide the starting-point. 
In seeking to arrive at a comprehension of the 
nature and workings of government and the 
organization of society, his attention is first di- 
rected towards the town-meeting, which he has 
possibly seen at work ; towards the policeman 
or the constable, whom he has learned to rec- 
ognize as the embodiment of executive author- 
ity before having learned the meaning of that 
term ; or towards the tax-collector, about whose 
visits certain ominous associations have clus- 
tered, before the function of that persona non 
grata has been realized. 

Is there not in the method thus illustrated 
a suggestion worth putting to the uses of liter- 
ature ? May not the young be led to a true 
perception of literary values by just this pro- 
cess of smoothing the ways that - lead to a cor- 
rect taste, this device of fitting the conscious 
achievement to the earlier unconscious one ? 
Those having occasion to observe young peo- 
ple who are going through the educational mill 
know that literary taste and a genuine delight 
in " the authors " are not common, that they 
are the exception rather than the rule. Yet 
most children have, in the earlier stages of 
their school life, some germ of literary appre- 
ciation that needs nothing more than careful 
nurture to be brought to flower in the later 
stages. But when they come to the serious 
study of literature in school or college, it pre- 
sents itself to them as a part of the " grind "; 
it must be pursued in a certain prescribed way, 
which is likely enough the wrong way ; it is 
treated as if it were geometry or linguistics ;

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



and the needs of the individual are lost sight 
of in the application of the system. 

It seems to us a fundamental principle that 
anything like rigidity in the methods employed 
for the teaching of literature and the develop- 
ment of literary taste will necessarily prove 
fatal to success. In physics or in philology, the 
" course " is a perfectly rational device ; it is 
of the essence of training in such subjects that 
the work should be logical in its development. 
The path of least resistance is in them the 
same, or nearly the same, for all normally con- 
stituted minds. It is obviously the path to be 
followed, and the treatment of a class en bloc 
becomes not only possible but desirable. With 
literature the case is very different, and the 
path of least resistance must be discovered for 
each individual separately. The imagination 
is a wayward faculty, and atrophy is likely to 
follow upon the attempt abruptly to divert it 
into channels other than those it listeth to seek. 
The facts of literature may be apprehended by 
the intellect thus constrained, but that emo- 
tional accompaniment which makes of litera- 
ture a personal message to the individual, which 
enshrines it, along with music and religion, in 
the most sacred recesses of the soul, is not to 
be coerced. Mere didactics are as powerless 
to impart the message of literature as they are 
to impart the message of music or of religion. 
The reward of such an attempt may be theology 
or counterpoint, formal rhetoric or literary his- 
tory ; but not that spiritual glow which is the 
one thing worth the having, that kindling of 
the soul which comes, perhaps when least ex- 
pected, with the hearing of some ineffable 
strain, or the reading of some lightning-tipped 
verse. 

There are many, no doubt, poor in emotional 
endowment, and unresponsive to the finer spir- 
itual vibrations aroused by the masterpieces of 
verbal art, to whom literature has hardly more 
meaning than nature had for the yokel of 
Wordsworth's hackneyed ballad. To one of this 
class, if he do not actually look upon Homer 
from the standpoint of Zoilus, or share in lago's 
view of the character of Othello, it is at least 
true that the last agony of Lear is nothing 
more than the death of an old man ; for him 
the solemn passing of QEdipus 

" To the dark benign deep underworld, alone " 

is only a sort of hocus-pocus, and his ears are 
deaf to the 

" Sudden music of pure peace " 

wherewith the stars seal the successive divis- 
ions of Dante's threefold song. 



But even for such as these the case is not 
altogether hopeless. The appeal of literature 
to the human soul is so manifold that it must 
find in every nature some pipes ready to be 
played upon. Dull though the sense may seem, 
it is at some point waiting to be quickened. 
For literature is life itself, in quintessential ex- 
pression ; how then can it fail, in some of its 
many phases, to have both a meaning and a 
message for every human being ? The earliest 
responsive vibrations may be rudimentary in 
character, and combined in the simplest of 
harmonies. The heart may first be stirred by 
some bit of sentiment that would be accounted 
cheap by a refined taste ; the imagination may 
first be fired by some grotesque M'drchen, or by 
some wildly improbable tale of romantic ad- 
venture. The ripest literary taste has such be- 
ginnings as these, and the surest appreciation 
of literature is built upon such a foundation. 
Between the child, made forgetful of his sur- 
roundings by the spell of " Robinson Crusoe " 
or the " Arabian Nights," and the man, find- 
ing spiritual refreshment in Cervantes or Mo- 
liere, renewed strength in Milton, or solace 
from grief in Tennyson, there is no real break ; 
the delight of the child and the grave joy of 
the man are but different stages of the same 
growth, and the one is what makes possible the 
other. 

How far this development may go is a prob- 
lem to be worked out for each individual sep- 
arately ; and there are doubtless, in each case, 
distinct limitations. What we have sought to 
emphasize is just this individual nature of the 
problem, and the fact that regimentation offers 
no solution that can be accounted satisfactory. 
The approach to literature is, in our current 
educational systems, hedged about with so 
many thorny obstructions that not a few young 
persons start bravely upon it only to fall by 
the way, disheartened at sight of the forbid- 
ding barriers erected by historical, linguistic, 
and metrical science, for the purpose of taking 
toll of all wayfarers. Whatever the useful- 
ness for discipline of such subjects, the spirit 
of literature is not to be acquired by making 
chronological tables, or tracing the genealogies 
of words, or working out the law of decreasing 
predication. We may even sympathize to some 
extent with those who so revolt from all such 
methods as to refuse literature any place in the 
educational scheme. Turn the young person 
loose, they advise, in a well-stocked library, 
and let him develop his own tastes in nis own 
way. He will make mistakes, they admit ;

THE DIAL

there will be false starts not quickly righted ; 
but there will be, in the long run, a wholesome 
development of taste, and a steady ascent to 
higher levels of appreciation. In any case, as- 
similation will not be forced, and conventional 
judgments will not be made to parade as per- 
sonal convictions. This view has the one great 
merit of allowing full scope to individualism, 
but to admit that it speaks the last word would 
be to abandon altogether the position that ed- 
ucational theory is bound to maintain. That 
the young may profit by the guidance of the 
older and wiser is as true in literature as it is 
in any other of the great intellectual concerns. 
But the needs of the individual must be rec- 
ognized as they are not now recognized, if lit- 
erature is to play its proper part in education. 
Each case must be made the subject of a spe- 
cial diagnosis and a special prescription. We 
might apply to this problem the favorite form- 
ula of one of the schools of modern socialism : 
" From every man according to his ability ; 
to every man according to his needs " al- 
though it is curious to see a socialist precept 
doing service in an individualist cause. 



ENGLISH LITERATURE AT CORNELL 
UNIVERSITY* 

At Cornell University, lectures are given on En- 
glish Literature, poetical and prose, from the four- 
teenth to the nineteenth century inclusive, in eight 
groups, of which Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, 
Milton, Dryden, Pope, Wordsworth, Browning, and 
Tennyson, are made the central figures. The lec- 
tures are given daily, except Saturday, and to the 
same class, so that there are about two hundred lec- 
tures given during the academic year. A large 
portion of the class are special students who have 
come to devote most of their time to English Liter- 
ature. They, accordingly, do a great deal of read- 
ing in connection with the lectures. It is made a 
special object of the lectures to bring the students 
into direct relationship with the authors treated, and 
hence much reading is introduced. The literature 
is presented mainly in its essential character, rather 
than in its historical, though the latter receives at- 
tention, but not such as to set the minds of students 
in that direction. It is considered of prime import- 
ance that they should first attain to a sympathetic

ing of English at American Colleges and Universities, of 
which the following have already appeared in THE DIAL:

appreciation of what is essential and intrinsic, be- 
fore the adventitious features of literature fea- 
tures due to time and place be considered. What 
is regarded as of great, of chief importance, indeed, 
in literary study, in some of our institutions of learn- 
ing, namely, the relations of works of genius to their 
several times and places (miscalled the Philosophy 
of Literature), is of the least importance, so far as 
culture, in its truest sense, is concerned. Litera- 
ture is thus made chiefly an intellectual and phil- 
osophical study ; its true function, namely, to quicken 
the spiritual faculties, is quite shut off. An exclu- 
sively intellectual attitude is taken toward what is 
a production of the whole man, as a thinking, emo- 
tional, imaginative, moral, and religious being, a 
production which can be adequately responded to 
only by one in whom these several attributes are, 
in some degree, active ; and literary education should 
especially aim after their activity; should aim to 
bring the student into sympathetic relationship with 
the permanent and the eternal with that which 
is independent of time and place. 

There is danger, too, in presenting literature to 
young people in its historical relations, and in " phil- 
osophizing " about it, of turning out cheap and pre- 
mature philosophers. A work of genius renders 
the best service when it is assimilated in its abso- 
lute character. All great works of genius are inti- 
mately related to the several times and places in 
which they were produced ; and it is important to 
know these relations, in the proper time when the 
" years that bring the philosophic mind " have been 
reached, not before. But it is far more important 
to know the relations of these works to the univer- 
sal, to the absolute, to that which is alive forever- 
more, by virtue of which alone they continue to 
live. Mrs. Browning, in her " Aurora Leigh," 
speaks of great poets as " the only truth-tellers now 
left to God the only speakers of essential truth, 
opposed to relative, comparative, and temporal 
truths ; the only holders by His sun-skirts, through 
conventional grey glooms." 

The mode in which genius manifests itself, at cer- 
tain times, in certain places, and under certain cir- 
cumstances, may be explained to some extent ; but 
the genius itself cannot be explained. Environ- 
ments stimulate or suppress, they do not and can- 
not make genius. The causes which bring it nearer 
to the essential world than men in general are 
brought, we cannot know. The explanation which 
can be given of its mode of manifestation should 
be called the Physiology, not the Philosophy, of 
Literature. 

And how is the best response to the essential life 
of a poem to be secured by the teacher from the 
pupil? I answer, by the fullest interpretative vocal 
rendering of it. f On the part of the teacher, two 
things are indispensable : first, that he sympathet- 
ically assimilate what constitutes the real life of 
the poem ; second, that he have that vocal cultiva- 
tion demanded for an effective rendering of what 
he has assimilated. Lecturing about poetry does

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



not, of itself, avail any more for poetical cultivation 
than lecturing about music avails, of itself, for mu- 
sical cultivation. Both may be valuable, in the 
way of giving shape to, or organizing, what has pre- 
viously been felt to some extent ; but they cannot 
take the place of inward experience. Vocal inter- 
pretation, too, is the most effective mode of culti- 
vating in students a susceptibility to form that 
unification of matter and manner upon which so 
much of the vitality and effectiveness of expressed 
spiritualized thought depend. 

There is no true estimate, among the leaders in 
the educational world, of what vocal culture, worthy 
of the name, costs ; and the kind of encouragement 
which it receives from them is in keeping with their 
estimate. A system of vocal training should be in- 
stituted in the lower schools which would give pu- 
pils complete command of the muscles of articula- 
tion, extend the compass of the voice, and render 
it smooth, powerful, and melodious. A power of 
varied intonation should be especially cultivated, as 
it is through intonation that the reader's sympa- 
thies are conducted, and the hearer's sympathies 
are secured. 

The reading voice demands as much, and as sys- 
tematic and scientific, cultivation, for the interpre- 
tation of the masterpieces of poetical and dramatic 
literature, as the singing voice demands for the 
rendering of the masterpieces of music. But what 
a ridiculous contrast is presented by the methods 
usually employed for the training of the reading 
voice, and those employed, as in conservatories of 
music, for the training of the singing voice! 

To return to the other wRrk in the Department 
of English Literature at Cornell: 

Readings are given by me every Saturday morn- 
ing, throughout the academic year, from English 
and American prose writers. These are open to all 
students and to any visitors who may wish to avail 
themselves of them. The attendance is generally 
large. The selections read are chiefly such as bear 
upon life and character, literature and art. The 
present year they have been, thus far, from essays 
of George Eliot, Professor Dowden, Mr. Ruskin, 
Mr. Leslie Stephen, Matthew Arnold, Emerson, 
Lowell, Frances Power Cobbe, and some other es- 
sayists. The regular members of the class after- 
wards read for themselves the compositions entire 
from which the selections are made, and many are 
inspired to read further from the same authors. 

There are four English Literature Seminaries, 
devoted, severally, to nineteenth century prose not 
including novels, seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
tury prose not including novels, novelists of the 
nineteenth century, and novelists of the eighteenth 
century. The seminaries are open to graduates, spe- 
cial students, and to undergraduates who have main- 
tained a high rank in the lecture courses. A work 
is assigned to each member of a seminary, of which 
he or she makes a careful study, and embodies the 
result in a paper which is read in the seminary and 
afterward discussed by the members, each member 



having been required to read in advance the work 
in hand. The papers bear chiefly, almost exclu- 
sively, on what is understood by their authors to 
constitute the life, the informing spirit, the moral 
proportion, the motives, of the works treated. The 
merely technical is only incidentally, if at all, 
treated. The present year, essays have been read 
on all the novels of George Eliot, and her poem 
" The Spanish Gypsy," the seminary consisting of 
twenty-seven members. All the essays have been of 
high merit, showing much insight into George Eliot's 
"interpretation of life." 

It should be added that twelve Plays of Shake- 
speare are read by me during the present academic 
year, so cut down as to occupy two hours each in 
the reading. It is purposed so to read, in a sep- 
arate course, next year, the thirty-seven Plays, two 
hours a week to be devoted to each play. I would 
also add that by the end of the present year I 
shall have read entire, with requisite comment, to 
an outside class composed of graduate and special 
students, Browning's " The Ring and the Book." 
The educating value of this great poem is of the 
highest character, embodying, as it does, the poet's 

ideal of a sanctified intellect.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MR. HENRY CAREY BAIRD AND FREE BOOKS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I think THE DIAL departed from its usual fairness 
and courtesy in its criticism of Mr. Henry Carey Baird, 
in the issue for March 1. 

1. It is hardly to be assumed that such a man as 
Mr. Baird would advocate a measure which could prop- 
erly be characterized as " stupid." 

2. May not Mr. Baird's opinion be based on the ob- 
vious fact that since the organization of this government 
its legislation has been consistently based on the idea 
that it should favor the citizens of this country in pref- 
erence to the rest of the world, while during all that 
time English books have persistently and urgently ad- 
vocated the reversal of this practice, and argued that 
the legislation should operate on all alike should favor 
the foreigner as much as the American; and that such 
has been their influence that one of the great parties of 
the country is trying to reverse the legislation of a cen- 
tury ? May not this induce Mr. Baird to oppose grant- 
ing this literature special favors ? 

3. As an abstract proposition, may not Mr. Baird be 
unable to see any good reason why the products of the 
English printing-presses and publishing-houses should 
be admitted free of duty, that does not apply as well 
to products of her looms and workshops ? 

JOHX J. JANNEZ. 
Columbus, Ohio, March 15, 1894, 

[Not to appear insensible to the good opinion of 
our correspondent, we give space to his communica- 
tion. We had not thought of charging Mr. Baird with 
a penchant for stupid measures, nor, on the other

hand, can we go quite so far in our correspondent's 
way of thinking as to believe that a stupid meas- 
ure, in Congress or elsewhere, becomes divested of 
its stupidity by the mere fact of Mr. Baird's ap- 
proval. And of all possible reasons for prohibiting 
the importation of foreign books, we think the very 
worst one is that given by our correspondent as 
held by Mr. Baird, viz., that because certain books 
contain ideas and doctrines that happen to be dis- 
tasteful to one class of citizens, the use of these 
books should be forbidden to citizens of all classes ; 
and not these books only, but every kind of books 
science, history, poetry, fiction, or religion com- 
ing from the offending country. Even the Russian 
system of literary censorship could hardly equal 
this. It may be true we are afraid it is that 
Mr. Baird is " unable to see any good reason " for 
making a distinction between books and scientific 
apparatus the means and implements of scholar- 
ship and knowledge and mere material manufac* 
tures. But this can hardly be offered as a reason 
why such a distinction should not be seen by others, 
nor why it should not be generally recognized by 
the enlightened sentiment of this and other civil- 
ized countries. EDR. DIAL.] 



MISPRINTS IN THE TEXT OF BURNS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On page 103 of your issue of February 16, a corre- 
spondent calls attention to a " time-honored " misprint 
in the text of Burns. Unfortunately, most of the edi- 
tions of Burns are full of misprints, owing largely, it 
would seem, to the fact that one of the earliest and 
most complete collections of the poet's works was set 
up in London by men who evidently were unfamiliar 
with the Scottish language. I refer to Currie's edition 
in four volumes ( 1801 ) . 

The words " gude-willie " and " waught," referred to 
by your correspondent, are fully explained in Jamieson's 
" Dictionary of the Scottish Language " ( 4 vols. quarto. 
1808-25 ). 

" Auld Lang Syne " was not printed in any of the edi- 
tions of the poet's writings issued during his life. 

Paterson, N. J., March 10, 1894. 

P. S. On page 72 of your issue of February 1, Mr. 
S. R. Elliott writes of "Bobby" Burns. Elliott is a 
good border name, and it is a little surprising that any- 
one bearing it should apply to " Rantin' Rovin' Robby " 
so misplaced a cognomen as " Bobby." 



"COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION LATIN" ONCE MORE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With deep pain I am reminded that I have done some 
injustice to our Columbian obelisk-inscription, which 
an inscrutable Providence has saved from the threaten- 
ing element. Heaven forbid that even that vagary of 
the stone-cutter should suffer wrong at my hands. The 
furnishing of a copy was intrusted to a friendly news- 
paper reporter. Of the " eleven errors," ten have 
merely to do with the graphic form of a single charac- 
ter, and in no wise with its value or meaning. Not of 
this nature were the indicated solecisms which drove 
their iron into my soul. My informant reported con- 



fidently an error in gender which did not exist ; but 
the Commissioner will surely absolve from malice a 
transcription which omits one combination even more 
impossible than those noted. Without compromising 
my rigorous ideals of scholarship, I say frankly that I 
conceived nobler uses of my time than in collating that 
sort of material with the minuteness of an Umpf enbach's 
Terence. But let not my Freshman screen himself be- 
hind such a tu quoque " as a defense. Out he shall go ! 

Evanston, III., March 26, 1894. JAME8 T ' HATFIELD " 



TYCHO BRAKE IN ENGLAND. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

One is so accustomed to regard the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica as an almost unquestioned authority on all 
subjects treated in its columns, that I was surprised re- 
cently on reading the article on Tycho Brahe to find a 
number of mistakes, both as to facts and spelling. It 
is stated there that " on the death of his father his uncle 
sent him in April" 1559, to study Philosophy and Rhet- 
oric at Copenhagen," whereas the father died in 1570. 
It was in this latter year, too, that Tycho returned from 
Germany, and not in 1571, as stated in the article. The 
pension granted to Tycho Brahe by the King was not 
of 2000 crowns, but 500 Rixdalers (1000 crowns). 
Among the orthographical slips may be noted Kunds- 
torp for Kundstrup, Schonen for Shaane, and Roschild 
for Roskilde. The spelling of the astronomer's island, 
Huen, while not perhaps incorrect, seems to be less de- 
sirable than the Danish form Hven or Hveen.

PROFESSOR EDUARD ZELLER, who succeeded to the 
chair of philosophy at Berlin on the death of Trendelen- 
burg in 1872, reached his eightieth birthday on January 
22. He has retired from active service as a professor, 
Dr. Karl Stumpf, formerly of Munich, having accepted 
a call to take the place thus left vacant. Professor Zel- 
ler's career has been a remarkable one in many ways. 
With the single exception of Lotze, perhaps no teacher 
of philosophy in Germany since Hegel and Herbart has 
exercised an influence equal to his. And yet he pro- 
fessed to teach no system of his own, but rather to ex- 
pound and criticise by the historical method the main 
problems of philosophy and the answers proposed to 
them. His literary style is remarkably good, and as a 
lecturer, while monotonous in his manner of delivery, 
he is decidedly interesting. Like Schelling and Hegel, 
Baur and Strauss, he is a Suabian. His early training 
was largely theological, and both Baur and Strauss 
were among his earliest university teachers. Baur's in- 
fluence and example led him to the study of early Chris- 
tianity, and from that it was a short step to the history 
of Greek philosophy. The latter subject, originally 
taken up as a means to an end, proved to be his life- 
work. His " Philosophic der Griechen " in six volumes 
all of which have passed through three editions, and 
some through as many as five is a recognized stan- 
dard. Its accurate scholarship, wide research, and con- 
stant subordination of speculation to interpretation, com- 
bine to make it in many ways a model of good historical 
writing. Some of his most important critical contribu- 
tions to modern philosophy are contained in his "Vor- 
trage und Abhandlungen," of which three volumes have 
appeared.

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



MEMORIALS OF Two ENGLISHWOMEN.* 

Matthew Arnold's expression, " the eminent 
fine spirit of our type of aristocratic perfec- 
tion," becomes fairly intelligible and specific as 
one reads the new work entitled " The Story 
of Two Noble Lives," three comely volumes 
containing the memorials of two amiable, beau- 
tiful, and gifted, if scarcely illustrious, sisters, 
Charlotte, Countess Canning, and Louisa, Mar- 
chioness of Waterford. The author, or rather 
the editor, Mr. Augustus J. C. Hare, preludes 
his rather copious and rambling account of his 
heroines' ancestry with an anecdote which may 
be quoted for its humor, if not exactly as an 
illustration of Mr. Arnold's phrase : 

" Lady Elizabeth Lindsay was one of a strange pro- 
cession of children who were met in a desolate road in 
Scotland, walking in single file, headed by the eldest 
boy, who was carrying the baby, gipsy-fashion, on his 
back. They were the eleven children of Anne, Coun- 
tess of Balcarres, making their escape from her harsh 
treatment, and going forth to seek their fortunes in the 
world. One of the younger boys had displeased his 
mother, and she had ordered a footman to throw him 
into the pond in front of the house. He managed to 
scramble out, and she desired that he might be thrown 
in again. Once more he clambered out, and she shouted, 
' Throw him in again,' when, with comic solemnity, the 
child looked up in her face and exclaimed, ' Woman, 
wad ye droon your ain son?' and she desisted, but 
forthwith the children determined to make their escape." 

Despite the Spartan severities of their mother 
(whom the radical reader will naturally at once 
set down as a type of her class), Lady Bal- 
carres's children, including, one hopes, the 
hero of the horse-pond " grew up wise, clever, 
cultivated, and God-fearing men and women." 
One of the daughters was the Lady Anne Bar- 
nard, celebrated as the author of that most pa- 
thetic of Scotch ballads, " Auld Robin Gray." 
The song made the greatest sensation at the 
time, its popularity extending even to France : 

" ' Voila Vauteur dufameux roman de " Robin Gray," ' 
people used to say in Paris when Lady Anne visited it. 
When she had written most of the poem she could not 
tell how to bring the climax about, and read it to her 
sisters. <Mak the coo dee,' said her little sister Eliza- 
beth." 

This inventive sister, Lady Elizabeth Lind- 
say, was married, in 1782, to Philip Yorke, 
third Earl of Hardwicke, son of the great Chan- 
cellor, and, from 1801 to 1806, Lord-Lieuten-

terford. By Augustus J. C. Hare. In three volumes, with

ant of Ireland. Lord and Lady Hardwicke's 
third daughter, Lady Elizabeth Yorke, mar- 
ried, in 1816, Lord Charles Stuart, British 
Ambassador at Paris, afterwards Lord Stuart 
de Rothesay ; and this brings us down to Mr. 
Hare's heroines proper, Charlotte and Louisa 
Stuart, children as the epitaphs phrase it 
" of the above." Into these genealogical de- 
tails our author plunges with a zest, a parade 
of titles, and a general reverential suggestion 
of Mayfair, Belgravia, Burke's "Peerage," and 
the like exalted matters, that might, perhaps, 
have drawn the fire of Mr. Thackeray, and will 
doubtless prove seductive to not a few Ameri- 
can readers. 

It was, we learn, a matter of surprise to their 
friends that the daughters of the plain Lord 
Stuart de Rothesay and his plainer wife should 
turn out so beautiful. In celebrating the charms 
of the younger sister in particular, Mr. Hare 
is prodigal of adjectives, but it must be ad- 
mitted his raptures are fairly borne out by the 
portraits submitted. At seventeen Louisa Stu- 
art was duly " presented at Court," and about 
the same time her mother took her to be painted 
by Hayter. The courtly painter used after- 
wards to describe the effect produced on him 
when Lady Stuart de Rothesay " took off her 
daughter's bonnet and let down her hair." " I 
was," he said, " dazzled by a vision of the most 
supreme loveliness, robed in a rippled vestment 
of golden hair, reaching far below her knees." 
So far, however, from being spoilt by the ad- 
miration she excited, Louisa Stuart would seem 
to have been surprisingly unconscious of it. 
" It is recalled," says our author, " as an in- 
stance of her entire absence of self-conscious- 
ness at this time, that one evening, going up a 
stair-case to a ball, she exclaimed, ' Mamma, do 
look at that girl with the handsome profile,' 
when her mother saw with amusement that she 
had not recognized her own reflection in a mir- 
ror." One would like to believe that story. 

While hardly a Penelope in point of suitors, 
Lady Louisa seems to have had the usual quota, 
among them the Duke of Hamilton, " the hand- 
somest man of his day," and a certain rhym- 
ing Lord Maidstone, who, on meeting her again 
many years after the day on which she had sent 
him away disconsolate, penned the following 
lines. They have a pleasant ring of the old 
Annuals, with their " sweet L. E. L.'s," and 
" Persons of Quality." 

' ' And after many years we met, 

And we were all alone ; 
I looked into her glorious face 
As one gazes on a stone. 



1894.]

" The vision of my youth was flown, 

The silver cloud was rent, 
The wheel was broken at the fount, 
The strong delusion spent." 

More fortunate than Lord Maidstone was 
the Marquis of Waterford, whom Miss Stuart 
met at a tournament in Scotland, in 1839. He 
had been known in youth as the " wild Lord 
Waterford," and, devoted as he was to hunting 
and sport, he seemed to have little in common 
with the spirituelle art-loving daughter of Lord 
Stuart de Rothesay. " But from the moment," 
says our author, " when her glorious beauty 
flashed upon him at the Eglinton tournament, 
he was her devoted knight, and only lived to 
win her." Like many men of his type, Lord 
Waterford was extremely diffident, and he 
shrank from a proposal till his sister had paved 
the way for him by a letter to Lady Stuart de 
Rothesay : 

" ' I have had the most extraordinary letter, Loo, 
from Lady Sarah Ingestre,' said Lady Stuart one day; 
'it is a proposal for you from her brother, and, of 
course, I must lose no time in writing a refusal'; and 
much was she astonished when her daughter said, Oh, 
but . . . wait a little ; I should like to think about it 
first." 

The tenor of the young lady's reply certainly 
leaves little doubt as to the sequel. The mar- 
riage took place on June 8, 1842, in the royal 
chapel of Whitehall, and Mr. Hare presents 
the details of the ceremony, and the imposing 
roll of titled personages who graced it by their 
presence, with becoming unction. Touching 
the appearance of the bride, a young girl who 
was present wrote, prettily enough, to Lady 
Hardwicke : 

" It was Louisa, who at that moment appeared in 
sight. By some accident her mother had moved from 
her side, and she sk>od alone, like a glorious picture of 
a poet's bride, in the arch of the chapel door, which had 
the effect of framing the costly picture. There she 
stood motionless, with her white robes and her long 
bridal veil, which covered her from head to foot. It 
was impossible to distinguish a feature, but the form 
was that of a marble statue of Beauty veiled. . . . She 
looked extremely pale, and for a moment seemed to have 
lost all consciousness of what was before her. Every- 
one said softly, ' Look ! Look ! ' the gentle music of 
the organ commenced a hymn of praise, and we held 
our breath lest the least earthly sound should make 
that heavenly vision glide away." 

The account of Lord and Lady Waterford's 
administration of their vast estate of Curragh- 
more forms, we need scarcely say, a bright 
chapter in the annals of Irish landlordism; and 
towards the lovely bride that he had won, the 
knight of the Eglinton tournament never wav- 
ered in the most loyal and chivalrous devotion. 
There was no cloud upon their married life. 



Forgetting his irregular past as if it were a 
dream, the "wild Lord Waterford" entered 
hand in hand with his wife into all her schemes 
for ameliorating the lot of those about them, 
and their efforts were crowned with success. 
Lady Waterford's whole heart was in Curragh- 
more. Not less than six hundred men found 
employment on the estate, and to these men 
and their families she was ever the Lady Boun- 
tiful, the wise and unobtrusive instructress, the 
ministering angel in the house of suffering 
and want. Mr. Hare details many of her use- 
ful works and benevolences, of her lesser chari- 
ties done in that Christian wise in which the 
left hand knoweth not what the right hand 
doeth. 

" To introduce habits of cleanliness into the Irish cab- 
ins, she would often go thither to make the beds herself, 
to show how it ought to be done, and would give per- 
sonal lessons in cleaning the rooms. . . . She gave them 
lime to whiten their walls, seeds for their gardens, and 
prizes for the best vegetables and most neatly-kept 
houses, whilst supplying their wants in many other 
ways. ... To beautify the houses of the Irish poor, as 
well as to make them more wholesome and comfortable, 
was one of Lady Waterford's greatest wishes." 

Lord Waterford's tragic death, in 1859, was 
a severe blow to the Curraghmore tenantry. 
A victim at last to his ruling passion, he was 
killed by a fall from his horse in the hunting- 
field, near Castlemorris, County Kilkenny. The 
injury was at first thought to be slight, for he 
lay, said his groom, " in his hunting-dress quite 
unbruised and beautiful "; but it was soon seen 
to be fatal, and this truly worthy and generous 
nobleman breathed his last on the spot where 
he fell. 

" { Oh, then,' said the faithful groom, ' there was an 
awful wail, though we would none of us believe it. ... 
Dr. O'Ryan rode on to break the terrible news to my 
Lady, and he met her driving her two white ponies up 
to the door, all gay and happy, and told her at first 
that my Lord had broken his thigh-bone and was very 
much hurt; but she saw by his face that it was worse 
than that, and said so, but he could not speak to her. 
Then she went away to her own room and locked herself 
in. When she knew by the cries and sobs in the court- 
yard that my Lord had been brought home, and when 
night was coming on, she ordered everybody away from 
her, and she looked on his face once more : but what 
my Lady did that night we none of us knew.' " 

There were those, however, who knew what 
Lady Waterford did that night, and the nights 
following, when the body lay in state in one of 
the state bedrooms of the castle. Throughout 
the week she remained locked in her chamber 
by day ; but when the night came, and the 
watchers were gone, taking her palette and 
brushes, " she stole down the silent passages to

the room where he lay, and she painted her 
dead husband in his last sleep," patiently and 
lovingly transferring his features to the can- 
vas, till the coffin-lid shut them away from her 
forever. A letter written at this time by Lady 
Waterford is a touching example of Christian 
resignation, and faith in the transitoriness of 
even the last of these earthly partings. 

" I must tell you how merciful God has been to me, 
how tenderly He has dealt at this terrible time. I can 
say with truth that He has let me rest myself on His 
pitying breast. ... I can feel that God has ordered all 
things rightly, and that I owe Him only the deepest 
thankfulness for the many happy years He gave me, 
and the recollections that I love to dwell on, and, in 
the fatal moment, how much mercy too. I feel sure 
there was no suffering; there were no hopeless hours of 
agony; and oh ! his beautiful dead face ! Dear Jenny, 
you never saw such an expression of peace and happi- 
ness, and not a scar only a calm and lovely sleep, the 
face in perfect health, not even the hue of death." 

Soon after the burial of her husband, Lady 
Waterford left Curraghmore forever, taking 
up her residence at Highcliffe, in Hampshire, 
and afterwards at her seat of Ford Castle, in 
Northumberland, where her last years were 
spent, and where she died May 11, 1891. The 
good works begun at Curraghmore had been 
carried on at Ford ; and after her death they 
wrote from there of how her coffin was borne 
to the churchyard on the shoulders of her own 
laborers. " When her things were being dis- 
tributed, the distributors were surprised to hear 
that ' the odd man ' most earnestly begged for 
something : it was for her old sealskin jacket. 
It was thought a singular request at first, but 
he urged it very much : he ' should treasure 
the jacket as long as ever he lived.' ' The 
" odd man," it seems, had once been walking 
by her donkey-chair in the road, when they 
found a female tramp lying in the ditch, ill 
and deserted. Lady Waterford at once got 
out of her chair, and helped the man lift the 
poor woman into it. Then she took off her 
own jacket, and put it on the sick woman, and 
walked home by the side of the chair, " tend- 
ing and comforting her all the way." " But 
it was not," said the " odd man," " it was not 
my lady's putting her jacket on the woman that 
I cared about, but that she did not consider 
her jacket the least polluted by having been 
worn by the tramp -for she wore it afterwards 
herself" 

In sketching, in a slight way, the career of 

this truly good Samaritan, we have lost sight of 

the elder sister, Lady Canning a character no 

ss worthy of Mr. Hare's liberal encomiums. 

Her husband, Charles John, Viscount Canning, 



was Governor-General of India at the time of 
the mutiny, and her letters and journals cov- 
ering that period are of considerable dramatic 
and historical interest. 

We subjoin a letter (which is not without 
its analogies for the American reader) regard- 
ing the course of the Anglo-Indian Press at a 
time when tact and a soothing of popular anx- 
iety might well seem even to the promoters 
of a " commercial enterprise " to rise to the 
dignity of a public duty. 

" The English Press has been very bad civil enough, 
usually, to C. himself, but running down others. That, 
however, is not the mischief: it points out all sorts of 
imaginary reasons and grievances as causes for mutiny, 
it spreads alarm, and shows up weakness, and gives in- 
formation, which, translated, may do untold mischief 
among the natives. . . . Treachery is not worse than 
such exceeding folly." 

The following extract is not without a cer- 
tain tragico-humorous aspect : 

" Dr. Leckie was on board the second flat to-day, and 
saw one of the American ( Presbyterian ) missionaries 
from Allahabad. Four of these and their wives were 
saved by taking refuge in the fort. They had a print- 
ing-press, and large schools. The printers, Moham- 
medan boys they brought up themselves, smashed the 
whole concern to atoms with delight ! and hunted out 
the native Christians, and a great many, who were em- 
ployed as servants, were killed." 

To the varied mass of letters and journals 
entrusted to him, Mr. Hare has supplied a 
thread of sympathetic, at times eloquent, nar- 
rative ; and his work as a whole affords a close 
and a very attractive view of English upper- 
class life, manners, and character. A feature 
of the work is the illustrations, several of them 
after original drawings from the gifted pencil 
of Lady Waterford.

is made striking and novel by the accompani- 
ment of the successive maps of the times. It 
is fascinating to follow upon these maps the 
slow development of correct ideas of the geog- 
raphy of our country, and to note the strange 
delusions in regard to it which so long held 
sway over the minds of men. By the aid of 
these charts can be realized, more forcibly per- 
haps than in any other way, the infinite toil and 
pains by which the truth was reached at last. 
With curious sensations one beholds the appear- 
ance and disappearance of rivers and lakes, 
their sudden shifting of locality, the upheaval 
and subsidence of mountains, and other start- 
ling changes of the map-makers, which seem 
to belong to the era of the formation of the 
globe and to be geological rather than histor- 
ical. And almost with a feeling of awe do we 
trace the development in human thought of the 
image of a New World from the chaos in which 
it lay, almost without form and void, to the par- 
tial perception of its magnificent proportions. 
At first believed to be only a group of islands 
on the shores of far Cathay, then but a barrier 
to the ocean approach to Asia almost as con- 
tracted throughout as at the Panama Isthmus, 
again simply a narrow rim of land inclosing a 
vast interior sea or an immense archipelago 
filled with channels, later a part of the Asiatic 
continent, and for almost two centuries deemed 
chiefly important because possibly affording a 
water-way to China, even in Count Frontenac's 
time the main outlines of the region east of the 
Mississippi alone were known, and the vast ter- 
ritory west of the Father of the Waters re- 
mained for later days to explore. 

It may be, as Mr. Winsor suggests, that Co- 
lumbus, at his death in 1506, was not ignorant 
that the geographical conditions revealed by 
his discovery were those of a new continent ; 
although the evidence seems hardly sufficient 
to establish this. At all events, the compre- 
hension of the fact came very slowly to his suc- 
cessors. The two great valleys of the Missis- 
sippi and the St. Lawrence, leading to the very 
heart of the New World, and practically unit- 
ing where Chicago now stands, lay invitingly 
open ; yet it was full forty years after the land- 
ing of Columbus before either stream was as- 
cended. The Spaniard Pineda, seeing the mouth 
of the Mississippi in 1519, did not enter it, 
because it was too far from the tropics to find 
gold therein. French and Portuguese fisher- 
men, and English sailors as well, made some 
claims to a knowledge of the St. Lawrence very 
early in the sixteenth century, but our author 



does not consider them well founded. We ar- 
rive at certainty only when we come to the voy- 
ages of Jacques Cartier, who made the circuit 
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and mapped its 
shores in 1534, and ascended the river St. 
Lawrence as far as Hochelaga, the site of Mon- 
treal, in 1535, giving the name by which both 
river and gulf came to be known to a bay on the 
northern shore of the latter. Nine years passed 
before there was any recognition of Cartier's 
discoveries in a printed map, and for the rest 
of the century there was little addition to the 
knowledge he brought back to Europe. Many 
maps were put forth based upon his descrip- 
tions and embodying various theories. One of 
these, published in 1570, was by a famous 
Flemish geographer, Abraham Ortelius. A 
copy of this, lately presented to the Chicago 
University, has attracted attention because sup- 
posed to have a name like that of Chicago in- 
scribed near the site of our city. It is evident, 
however, that the word in question Chilaga 
is derived from Hochelaga ; and it is placed on 
Ortelius's map near the junction of the Ottawa 
and St. Lawrence, in the neighborhood in 
which Cartier found the Indian village of that 
name. 

Champlain's era in Canada, from 1615 to 
1635, added the Ottawa route, the upper St. 
Lawrence, the region of Lake Champlain and 
Lake Huron, to the cartography of the period. 
Champlain visited what is now Boston Harbor 
in 1604, and believed from the accounts of the 
natives that the River Charles extended to the 
land of the Iroquois. Accordingly this stream 
appears, from his map of 1612, as flowing from 
a source southwest of Lake Champlain and 
well within the present state of New York. His 
great map of 1632, representing Lakes Cham- 
plain, Ontario, and Huron, also shows the Sault 
Ste. Marie, a great lake beyond it, and the be- 
ginning of the Straits of Mackinac, but with 
Green Bay moved to the north Side of Lake 
Huron. Lake Erie, for a long time after Lakes 
Ontario and Huron were well known, eluded 
the explorer and the geographer. Champlain's 
earlier maps ignored it ; his later ones made 
it a narrow river. This conception of it was 
accepted by Ogilby and other English cartog- 
raphers for many years. Jolliet, in return- 
ing from Lake Superior in 1669, was the first 
of white men to follow its northern shore, 
which Galinee's map, drawn in that year, de- 
picted, but left its southern shore a blank. Jol- 
liet's maps of 1674 fairly show its whole out- 
line; but Hennepin in 1683, and even in 1697,

extended it southward across the Valley of the 
Ohio. Franquelin showed it correctly in 1684, 
but it was hardly relegated to its proper posi- 
tion in the general understanding until the sev- 
enteenth century had nearly closed. Cartier 
and Cham plain both seem to have heard of the 
Falls of Niagara, but there was no adequate 
idea of their magnitude until Hennepin saw 
them in 1679. He atoned for any shortcom- 
ings of his predecessors by making them 500 
feet high ! The journeys of Nicolet to the Wis- 
consin country in 1634 ; of the daring coureurs 
de bois, Grosseilliers and Radisson, to Lake 
Superior and the upper Mississippi in 1658-60; 
of Jolliet and Marquette in 16735, and those 
of La Salle and Tonty and others of lesser note, 
are all chronicled in this volume. By degrees 
the information obtained by these venturesome 
explorers reached the cartographers and cor- 
rected their work. One of these was Jean Bap- 
tiste Louis Franquelin, at that time residing in 
Quebec, where he held the post of King's hy- 
drographer, in which Jolliet succeeded him. 
In 1684, Franquelin, who zealously gathered 
every discoverer's accounts, made a great map 
of the interior of North America, which Park- 
man considered the most remarkable of all the 
early maps of that region. On this the Chi- 
cago river is shown with the word " Cheagou- 
meman " at its mouth, with a building resem- 
bling a chapel, and the inscription " 80 h," 
doubtless referring to the number of Indian 
lodges there. In 1688 he reproduced this map, 
with some changes, and one of these is to note 
a " Ft. Chicagou " located on the same river. 
It is known that there was a fort on the site of 
Chicago as early as 1685, and it probably was 
built in that year, as it does not appear on 
Franquelin's earlier map. 

Many other things of interest to all who ap- 
preciate the momentous and romantic history 
of the interior of North America might be no- 
ticed in the text and cartographical illustrations 
of this handsome volume, did space permit. It 
is summed up in the author's inscription of his 
work to President Angell of the University of 
Michigan, which describes it as relating to " the 
great valley shared by the American people 
with others in the North, and the greater val- 
ley of the interior, all their own, almost becom- 
ing one with the other at various points, which 
carry the streams of national life back and 
forth between the gulf which Cartier opened 
and that other gulf which Columbus failed to 
comprehend."

DEMOCRITUS REDIVIVUS. * 



An old friend of the seventeenth century 
comes back to us in very fresh and sumptuous 
apparel. Mr. A. H. Bullen, who has lived 
on familiar terms with the Elizabethan and 
Jacobean worthies, accompanies him and rein- 
troduces him to a generation that might have 
forgotten the old scholar's face. With words of 
rare pleasantness, as one performing no formal 
duty but speaking from his heart, he presents 
this capped and gowned ancient as his life-long 
friend. A favorite with sturdy Samuel John- 
son, and with the capricious humorist, Charles 
Lamb ; an author who gave an impulse to the 
muse of Milton ; whom Fuller praised for " va- 
riety of much excellent learning "; of whom 
Wood of the A then se Oxonienses said, " Gentle- 
men ' who are put to a push for invention ' may 
furnish themselves with matter from him," a 
hint which Sterne took, plundering from these 
"sumless treasuries" the out-of-the-way lore 
that ballasts the whimsies of " Tristram 
Shandy," this contemporary of Shakespeare 
and Bacon still finds, in the age of Browning 
and Darwin, those who relish him. His sci- 
ence is all grown obsolete, his facts are useless 
without laborious sifting, his multitudinous 
quotations quite smother and obstruct his own 
wit and sense ; but his curious learning, his sim- 
ple earnest rational religion, his generous and 
hospitable temper, his sub-acidulated, arch, and 
playful humor, his keen insight into human 
nature in scholar and divine, cloistered recluse 
and man of the world, hysteric girl and boy 
" deep in the dumps," and his multifarious ref- 
erences to authors that only "live one day 
more " because Burton has seen fit to quote 
them, all these things, combined with a 
shrewd, manly, pithy style, not, as one might 
have feared, deformed with undue mixture of 
latinisms, make the "Anatomy of Melancholy " 
as good a book to lie on the window seat, or 
on the bedside table with a match and a shaded 
candle handy, as any in the range of the whole 
library. Not Ho well, nor Montaigne,, nor Cer- 
vantes, not "Elia" and not " Yellowplush," 
nor our own " Easy Chair," nor " Parson Wil-

his pillow. Schoolboys have thumbed its pages, 
who needed a dictionary to decipher its endless 
stores of choice and doubtful latinity, and 
lacked experience of life to understand its un- 
dercurrents of humor. Scholars have vexed 
themselves to conjecture where in the wide field 
of literature might lurk a line quoted, without 
the usual clue in the crowded footnotes. One 
such scholar, the editor of this edition, has 
tracked, as with hawk or hound, numberless 
evasive fugitives to their lair in classic, patris- 
tic, scholastic, or renaissance folios. Had not 
ill-health forbade him to continue his chase, he 
had doubtless brought home many another 
brush in triumph. A very full index has light- 
ened the labor of all future explorers, who, 
not content with straying over the fragrant 
meadows, desire to go deeper and make a study 
of this curious treatise. The three volumes, 
very unequal in bulk, each containing one of 
the " partitions " of the work upon the causes 
and the cure of Melancholy in general, and 
upon Love Melancholy and Religious Melan- 
choly in particular, are admirably printed. 
Very many of the passages of his own and 
other writing which our author, from negli- 
gence or caution, left in their native Latin, 
have been for the first time pithily Englished. 
And many an ancient worthy may turn to his 
neighbor on the page emerging from three cen- 
turies of obscurity, and cry " Bless thee, Bot- 
tom, thou art translated ! " The above men- 
tioned schoolboys will be frankly, and some 
other readers, whose " old Italian," as the Au- 
tocrat calls it, has grown rusty, will be covertly 
grateful. We all read Latin like English, but it 
is still pleasant to see another scholar's version 
of it. If Mr. Shilleto's health had not failed 
him, doubtless the work in this regard had been 
completed, and some lack of consistency in the 
placing of these translations been avoided. 
None the less, the present issue, if not the 
" definitive edition " which Mr. Bullen is dis- 
posed to demand from Oxford scholars, may 
be pronounced by far the most elegant and ser- 
viceable edition now to be procured of one of 
the treasures of English literature. 

To be sure, Hazlitt did not relish the " Anat- 
omy of Melancholy," and doubtless many a 
nerveless reader will shelter himself behind 
that great critic's shield. But Hazlitt was fas- 
tidious and whimsical. His eccentric taste, his 
queasy appetite, found no savor in what others 
relished, while detecting a special tang that 
allured his palate in viands that were caviare to 
the multitude. I know that many a listless 



ruffler of the pages of the novels and magazines, 
the thin essays and compressed abridgements, 
of this present generation, will feel lost in the 
dense growths of Burton's jungle, and sigh for 
barren asphalt or clear-swept cobblestones. I 
know that this stout haggis with its " deal of 
fine confused feeding " will be to many a one 
as the cold sirloin and strong tankard of good 
Queen Bess's table, offered at breakfast-time 
to a modern club-man, as he sips his tea and tri- 
fles with his toast, a puny trencherman, over his 
morning paper. I know that there are those 
who will quote, at the expense of this enor- 
mous and catholic quoter, the words of his 
great contemporary, and tell him that he has 
been " at a feast of languages and stolen the 
scraps," that his table is laden with cold vic- 
tuals begged all round the welkin. I recognize 
the relief that the modern mind, impatient of 
parentheses, with small leisure for loiterings, 
cannot but feel when Burton lets his own cur- 
rent flow unimpeded, nor delays to irrigate his 
crops by opening endless floodgates and letting 
on the rush of authorities from fifteen Chris- 
tian, and some earlier, centuries. One is often 
tempted to say to him, as to some modest and 
kindly host, who persists in drawing out each 
of the guests, not all of his own calibre, about 
his table, " Will you not talk yourself, dear 
sir, and let these minor fires flicker on, or out, 
without the persuasion of your hospitable bel- 
lows? Give us Burton in undiluted potency. 
We can spare for a while Fuchsius, and Fer- 
nelius, and Hercules de Saxonia. Cardan and 
Paracelsus are workers of magic, but there is 
a certain Rector of Segrave and scholar of 
Christ Church to whom we would listen gladly. 
A sentence from his mouth will be as weighty 
as if uttered by Cappivaccius or Jason Pra- 
tensis." 

What an odd fantastic company of forgot- 
ten worthies the " Anatomy of Melancholy " 
brings before us ! True, Virgil and Ovid, 
Tully and Plato, have seats at the table ; but 
what a throng of unnoted wits and doctors be- 
side! As one might dine to-day with some 
whimsical Amphitryon who loves to collect 
" characters " about his board, and set their 
queer tongues wagging with his out-of-the-com- 
mon vintages, and surprise his chance guest 
with contact with persons whom one "never 
meets in society," so a reader opens his Bur- 
ton to find himself cheek-by-jowl with writers 
nowhere else to be encountered. As the As- 
syrian invader tauntingly inquired, " Where are 
the Kings of Harmath and Arpad, and of the city

of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivah ? and where 
are the peoples of Gozan and Haran and Re- 
zeph, and the children of Eden which were in 
Thelasar ? " so we are tempted mockingly to 
ask, Who are these imposing authorities that are 
dumped upon us by the dozen and the score as 
men of substance and consequence ? They are 
like Rembrandt's furred and bearded Burgo- 
masters, of tremendous presence, but of no rec- 
ognized potency. Who is Rodericus a Castro, 
to be distinguished from Rodericus a Fonseca ? 
Who are Prosper Calenus and Trincavellius and 
Zanchius Guianerius and Hildesheim and John 
Baptista Silvaticus and Laelius a Fonte Eu- 
gubinus, that great doctor? Who has read 
Saint Briget's revelations, or the dialogues of 
Caesar Vanninus, or that pleasant tract of 
Machometes Bragdedinus, or the Hodaepori- 
cons of Jod. a Meggen ? The very names take 
a modern man's breath away. They suggest 
more than mortal wisdom. Yet their sayings 
are no such mighty things. John Smith and 
William Jones in their time have said better 
ones. We nudge our neighbor and ask, Who is 
yon ancient sage who sits beside you ? " Never 
set eyes on him before, I assure you," is the 
answer. " One meets strange comrades here. 
All is fish that comes within the range of our 
good Burton's drag-net." You consult the en- 
cyclopaedias and the biographical dictionaries. 
Ten to one, there is no entry of the famous 
name, or some such record as this : " A Dutch 
physician referred to in the ' Anatomy of Mel- 
ancholy.' " Ten to one, also, that if by chance 
a fact or two to mark the man remains, he 
proves no longer half so weighty as Burton 
himself, and when you turn back to his saying 
it proves neither epigram nor oracle, and you 
wonder why with all his haul of bigger fishes 
the author should have picked out this sprat 
or smelt and sent it to the frying-pan, and 
served it in his lordly dish. 

All that is true enough ; but presently your 
insignificant neighbor at the board mentions 
carelessly that at " Hammel in Saxony, on the 
20th day of June, A. D. 1484, the devil, in 
the likeness of a pied piper, carried away one 
hundred and thirty children, who were never 
after seen," and at the word the Pied Piper of 
Hamelin town is making his magic music in 
your ears, and you know that Robert Brown- 
ing has sat at that rich table, and repeated its 
stories afterwards in his own wonderful way. 
Or you catch a chance illusion to Macbeth and 
Banquo, and prick up your ears for something 
wicked to come your way, and find it is not 



Shakespeare who is quoted, nor even Hollin- 
shed's Chronicles whence the Avon poet drew 
his plot, but Hector Boethius not by any 
means the Boethius from whom Hollinshed 
drew the story first. As you listen, what de- 
licious old-time phrases fly about you ! You 
hear of circumforanean rogues, of turgent and 
stupend titles, of pasquils and compellations, 
of parats and foliots, of kells and tunicles. 
You hear " indecorum " and " catastrophe " 
used with an air of apology, italicised as not 
yet fairly good English, not at all " ingenite " 
in the language, but only " acquisite " of late. 
If you offend, you may be bidden to " go woll- 
ward," but, while trembling at the awful un- 
known penalty, receive " so gentle and bart- 
able a pardon " that you fear no more, and in 
the " obnubilation " from the burning of Sir 
Walter's new plant from the Americas, the vis- 
ion vanishes, and you are back in the nineteenth 
century again. 

If you are a comfortable Latinist you have 
needed no interpreter. 'The Saxon and the 
Roman speech will serve. With all Burton's 
varied and recondite learning, he makes little 
use of any other than the universal language 
of scholars and his own vernacular. In read- 
ing with care nearly or quite half his treatise, 
the reviewer has come across no single Spanish 
or Italian or German citation, but a dozen 
words of Greek (could Burton have read his 
Plato or Thucydides with a " pony " ?), and but 
two briefest phrases from the French, which 
any lad might have picked up from some trav- 
eled neighbor or monsieur in exile, sans argent 
and a la mort. But anything extant in choice 
or dubious Latin, anything on Burton's own 
crowded shelves or in the alcoves of the Bod- 
leian, may Jbe drawn upon at any time, with 
quite undistinguishing regard. 

I do not think it was often the beauty, the 
fancy, the imagination of the passage that 
brought it to Burton's mind. Like many an- 
other master of style, he was comparatively in- 
sensitive to the charms of style was seeking 
not for ornament but use. The line of Ovid 
or the sentence of Livy was no more welcome 
than the passage from Struthius or Curio. If 
it was in the line of his thought, that was all 
he cared for. The seeker for epigrams, for 
gems of verse or prose is not often gratified. 
Burton quotes to confirm what he has said or 
to lead up to what he wants to say. The wit- 
ness may talk twattle if he will only testify to 
the one point in question. 

For in those days, a book was per se an au-

thority. What got in print was gospel until 
at least a conflicting gospel was revealed. There 
was a certain presumption in its favor, how- 
ever questionable that which it contained. An 
author was still not far removed from his old- 
time priesthood. It was not yet credible that 
words in type conveying the observations of 
learned men might be as valueless as old crone's 
tales. The sifting, discriminating, critical judg- 
ment of science, that tests all things, that tries 
each antecedent plausibility by repeated exper- 
iment, that proceeds by cautious induction from 
selected facts, and not by brilliant deduction 
from axiom or postulate, was not yet in vogue. 
The contemporaries of Francis Bacon still 
bowed to the authority of Aristotle, and the 
author of the " Novum Organum " was still an 
unaccredited innovator. So Burton quotes, 
with varying emphasis indeed, and half sug- 
gestion of a hesitating credence, but on the 
whole with large acceptance, ancients and mod- 
erns, thinkers and pedants, philosophers and 
charletans, of Italy and Germany and France 
and England, and lets them bear their quite 
unequal testimony to all sorts of marvellous 
events and opinions. That melancholy men 
are witty, Aristotle is authority ; that blind 
men never blush, Dandinus says it ; that the 
devil is an expert physician, so Godelman bears 
witness ; that a Spanish Marquis made one of 
his slaves young again, as Renatum Morey de- 
clares, all these things Burton gravely re- 
cords, as what a sober mind would hardly deny, 
though an emancipated philosopher might hold 
his judgment in suspense as to some of them, 
where the doctors differ too widely. The me- 
diaeval identification of faith and credulity was 
not yet broken up. Burton, though suspicious 
of a pagan or a Jesuit miracle, still allowed oc- 
cult causes generous playroom within the lim- 
its of his large belief. 

The same deference to authority is visible in 
Burton's homage to the royal pedant who fid- 
getted uneasily in the great queen's seat. James 
I. had been eighteen years on the throne when 
the first edition of the " Anatomy of Melan- 
choly," with its queer enigmatic frontispiece, 
appeared. And Burton pays him tribute, not 
in a set dedication, a mere form of custom, 
courtesying even to small kings, but full in the 
body of the text, once as " Another Numa, a 
second Augustus, a true Josiah," and again as 
" our Amulet, our Sun, our Ptolemy, our com- 
mon Maecenas, Jacobus munificus, Jacobus pa- 
cificus, mysta Musarum, rex Platonicus, grande 
decus, columeuque nostrum." And when, thus 



belauded, that earliest English Stuart, with his 
tincture of honest scholarship but his unroyal 
pettiness of fibre, had gone over to the major- 
ity, in his next edition Burton improves the 
occasion, and adds, " But he is gone, this Sun 
of ours is set, and yet no night follows. We 
have such another in his room," and so makes 
his bow to that falsest of melancholy monarchs, 
Charles the First. 

Did shrewd and sturdy men like Burton an- 
atomize and decipher character no better than 
this ? Did they believe and hope such things, 
or only say such things, as we use unmeaning 
social forms to-day ? It is hard to tell. Per- 
haps in the eyes of a recluse of loyal Oxford, 
the divinity that doth hedge a King made such 
hyperboles of homage decent and credible. 
The turning of the compliment from James to 
Charles reminds us how a greater than Burton 
passed his plaudits on from Elizabeth to James 

"This bird of honour dies, this maiden phenix 
Her ashes new create another heir 
As great in admiration as herself 

" Who from the sacred ashes of her honour 
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was, 
And so stand fixed " 

transfixed, indeed, in sheer amaze at such an 
apotheosis. Shakespeare wrote in verse with 
all a poet's license, and his play was to be en- 
acted before the Court, which might account 
for florid adulation. But, after eighteen years 
of James's inglorious reign, the thing is strange 
in Burton, who surely was no courtier. 

It is strange also that with all his quoting, 
Burton should have made comparatively little 
use of the brilliant literature of the Elizabethan 
and Jacobean age. Had he read Shakespeare's 
immortal works ? There is a quotation from 
" an elegant poet of ours " in his " Rape of Lu- 
crece," and another from the "Venus and 
Adonis"; but the only reference to the plays is 
a quotation, mis-cited, of the doggerel couplet 
that ends the last scene of " Romeo and Juliet," 

" For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo." 

Of Francis Bacon we have three brief pas- 
sages ; while of Roger Bacon there are nine. 
Of Beaumont, of Fletcher, of Massinger, of 
Ford, of Middleton, there is not one. Daniel 
is more a favorite, and " the English Ovid " 
Drayton. Spenser, "our modern Maro," is 
quoted half a dozen times ; Sidney's "Arcadia " 
once. Marlowe is noticed several times. But 
a treatise upon melancholy could have found 
its richest illustrations in Hamlet and Mac- 
beth and Timon and Othello and King Lear, 
and all the world of diseased contemplations 



212

that make up the sum of the Elizabethan drama ; 
and Burton evidently hunted far afield, while 
regardless of much that lay close to his own 
door. After all, authors are not always " up " 
in the writings of their contemporaries. The 
" Fable for Critics " had been published half 
a dozen years before Emerson had come upon 
the passage that concerned himself. 

It is comforting to note in any one direc- 
tion a probable gap in Burton's omniscience. 
It is far easier to guess what he had not read 
than what he had. Make a list of Greek and 
Latin classics, of the Fathers of the Eastern 
and Western Church, of the Arabian sages, 
of the schoolmen, doctors seraphic and doc- 
tors angelic, of the voyagers on unknown seas 
and travellers in undiscovered countries, of 
the divines and the saints and the lawyers, 
the alchemists and the chemists, the physicians 
and metaphysicians of all lands and ages, 
then go to the index of " Burton's Anatomy " 
as the likeliest place to encounter them every- 
one. As we turn the pages we forget that they 
are but print and paper.. We seem to be seated 
on a magic carpet, or mounted on the horse of 
brass, and to be borne across the world from 
China to Peru, threading our way past Do- 
donian groves and Babylonian gardens, Egypt- 
ian temples and Roman palaces and Teutonic 
shrines, and listening to a Babel chorus of 
voices out of every nation under heaven. We 
cry, in Burton's own eloquent and Jeremy- 
Taylor-like outburst, " As a long-winged hawk, 
when he is first whistled off the fist, mounts 
aloft and for his own pleasure makes many a 
circuit ... so will I, having now come into 
these ample fields of air . . . awhile rove, 
wander round about the world, mount aloft to 
those etherial orbs and celestial spheres, and 
so descend to my former elements again." As 
we descend, these former elements seem dull 
and paltry. When again shall we ride Levia- 
than, behold the Phoenix, talk with Prester 
John, and live with the wits, the poets, the 
scholars of all time ? Only when once more 
we submit ourselves to Burton's mighty spell.

AMERICAN POTTERY AND PORCELAIN.* 



Mr. Barber, the author of " The Pottery and 
Porcelain of the United States," has been well 
known to china collectors for some years past 
as an indefatigable gatherer of items relating 
to the pottery and porcelain of this country. 
His little printed slips, asking for information 
and suggestions, are familiar to china-owners 
all over the country ; and the result of his un- 
wearied investigations may be found in this 
beautifully printed and illustrated book. As 
a work of the printer's art, it leaves nothing to 
be desired. The graceful and beautiful vases 
and jars, and the portions of table services so 
carefully and perfectly depicted therein nota- 
bly those of the Chesapeake Pottery and the 
Rookwood Pottery make one thrill with pa- 
triotic pride, and renew the sense of satisfaction 
felt at the Columbian Exposition at the sight of 
the beautiful exhibits of the American manu- 
facturers of pottery and porcelain. 

As in his preface Mr. Barber avows that 
one of " the main purposes of the work is to 
furnish an account of such of the earlier pot- 
teries as, for any reason, possess some histor- 
ical interest," it is to be deplored that the 
chapters on " Early Pottery in America " 
(seventeenth century) and " Potteries of the 
Eighteenth Century " are not fuller and more 
exhaustive. In the first-named chapter the 
author does not even refer to the possibility of 
pot-works existing in New England at that 
date. Yet in 1646 the General Court of Mas- 
sachusetts ordered that "tyle earth to make 
sale ware shall be digged before the first of 
9 mo, and turned over in the last or first be- 
fore it be wrought." In Connecticut and Mas- 
sachusetts, potters were frequently on the list 
of freemen. Higginson, writing of the town 
of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1629, said : " It 
is thought here is a good clay to make bricks 
& tyles and earthen-pot as may be. At this 
instant we are setting a brick kill to work." 
The Salem or Danvers kilns were certainly as 
early in operation as any pot-works in the col- 
onies. In Mr. Barber's chapter on eighteenth 
century works he scantily notices the progress 
of ceramic manufacture in the New England col- 
onies. The Danvers potteries, unnamed by him, 
had become important. Morse's Gazetteer of 
1797 says of this town : " Large quantities of

brick and coarse earthen ware are manufac- 
tured here." It is said there were twenty pot- 
works in Danvers at that date. On Long 
Island many potteries existed, though Mr. Bar- 
ber does not name them ; at Whitestone, Flat- 
bush, New Lots, and other Long Island towns, 
quite an extensive manufacture of coarse pots, 
pans, urns, etc., was carried on. That con- 
siderable pottery was made in other parts of 
Massachusetts, we cannot doubt. In the adver- 
tisements of the " Boston News Letter," as 
early as 1716, among the " servants to be dis- 
posed of " on board the ship on which these 
" redemptioners " came over, were "earthen- 
ware Pottery-makers." " Mangness " for the 
use of potters was an article of barter. By 
1769 much encouragement was given to the 
manufacture of various fictile wares, and good 
wages were offered to potters " Twenty Dol- 
lars per month, with Victuals, Drink, Washing 
and Lodging." And the Connecticut newspa- 
pers, of dates immediately previous to and after 
Revolutionary times, contain many references to 
pot-works and potters. Doubtless all this New 
England pottery was simple porous stoneware 
milkpans, jugs, and pipkins, but quite as 
worthy of extended reference as the pottery of 
Pennsylvania, of which Mr. Barber writes. 

I would also note, in passing, Mr. Barber's 
rather confusing arrangement. In the chapter 
entitled " The Eighteenth Century " he places 
manufactories and manufactures of much later 
dates some 1809 ; Sgraffiato ware marked 
1826 ; John Nases wares, 1812 and 1830, and 
even as late as 1847 ; Jacob Shell's wares, 
1831 ; and several others. The part of this 
chapter devoted to slip decorated and Sgraffiato 
ware is perhaps the most interesting portion 
of the book. The succeeding chapters on wares 
of our own times have been prepared with great 
care and intelligence, and appear to be very 
exhaustive. The one on china-marks will cer- 
tainly be valuable in future time, and the ones 
on tiles and decorative terra cotta are very in- 
structive. 

It is certainly praiseworthy to preserve in 
such handsome form the actual accomplish- 
ments of the pottery manufacturers of the 
United States to-day, for facts are quickly for- 
gotten ; the history of the much disputed 
Lowestoft ware may be held up as an example 
of the short length of time in which authentic 
data of a certain pottery manufacture may be 
lost. Still, the Lowestoft wares were made be- 
fore the days of trade catalogues, before the vast 
advertisement of all manufactured materials. 



It would seem that such a contingency could 
scarcely arise in the future with regard to our 
present productions. 

Though this book is very valuable as a cata- 
logue or manual, it need not be criticised as 
literature. Stopford Brooke says, " Writing 
is not literature unless it gives to the reader a 
pleasure which arises not only from the things 
said, but from the way in which they are said." 
Mr. Barber's "way of saying" his style is 
not interesting. This fact does not, of course, 
impair the worth as a book of reference. It 
might be argued that a technical work like this 
is usually rather dry reading ; but as an exam- 
ple of what such a book may be, or rather what 
a work on precisely similar lines is, let me call 
attention to Llewellyn Jewitt's " History of the 
Ceramic Art of Great Britain," a book univer- 
sally interesting even to the reader who cares 
nothing for china. 

Ruskin says, " Side - glimpses sometimes 
bring home better results than a broad stare." 
It is the side-glimpses at the potter's art of 
early times that we miss in Mr. Barber's book. 
We should like to have known a little of the 
amount of production and exportation of pot- 
tery and porcelain in England ; somewhat of 
the condition and number of foreign-born pot- 
ters in America at that day ; to be shown more 
fully why so little was made of American re- 
sources in pottery materials, why so slowly 
they were developed. But we have only a very 
broad stare at the blank facts of the manufac- 
ture of china in the United States. 

And yet some side-glimpses are given. For 
instance, we are told much of one Mr. Taylor ; 
that he served in the army in the war of the 
Rebellion, that he has been postmaster of his 
town, that he is a warm personal friend of Gov- 
ernor McKinley, etc., etc., all very estimable 
traits, and then, after the index at the end of 
the book, we have also a very pretty advertise- 
ment of Mr. Taylor's hotel ware. But these 
scarcely answer our notions of what might be 
said on such an art-subject as china.

STUDIES ix AMERICAN POLITICS AXD 
POLITICAL HISTOKY.* 



Mr. Daniel Greenleaf Thompson's " Politics in a 
Democracy "is an incisive study of some features 
in our American political life from a point of view. 
The author has very pronounced partisan prejudices, 
and he sees facts accordingly. His characteriza- 
tion of the modern Republican Party reads quite 
like the indictment which Callender or Benjamin 
Franklin Bache were wont to draw against the Fed- 
eralists. The trouble with any strong partisan is, 
not so much that he is blind, as that his eyesight 
gives out before the facts do. Mr. Thompson has 
a way of seeing quite clearly facts which are conven- 
ient. But one who reads his discussion of Tam- 
many is apt to wonder whether a realizing sense of 
the value of that remarkable institution to the for- 
tunes of a national party may not perhaps envel- 
ope the tiger in a somewhat mellowing atmosphere 
of sweetness and light. Mr. Thompson repeats 
some of the familiar things which Lalor's Cyclo- 
paedia has to say about Tammany Hall, adds a few 
other equally familiar facts, and then proceeds to 
chat and generalize in a very entertaining way. 
While he points out the evils of Tammany, still he 
spends a large proportion of his strength in show- 
ing the good features. And really he makes out a 
pretty strong case. As one closes the book one is 
apt to feel a dawning suspicion that the standards 
of judgment taught in the colleges and churches 
and magazines are perhaps rather artificial and su- 
perfine that these stalwart liquor-dealers who 
make up half of the Tammany executive committee 
are on the whole an honest and amiable set of fel- 
lows ; that in managing politics with an eye single 
to the emoluments of office and contracts, there is 
after all nothing vicious, but merely a tendency. 
Of course no moral quality inheres in a "tendency." 
And there may be something essentially mistaken

low-downness, and this is a democratic country, the 
only rational thing is to get down to the general 
level as soon as possible. 

But is it true that democracy and venality are 
inseparable ? If a man earns a living by driving 
a cart, is it so sure that he has more moral obtuse- 
ness and less rugged common-sense than his pol- 
ished neighbor in the brown-stone front? 

There are two things which Mr. Thompson makes 
plain, but the significance of which needs more em- 
phasis than he gives them. The essence of Tam- 
many Hall is venal politics. It is an organized con- 
spiracy to get and keep control of the public funds 
of the city of New York. All other matters 
sympathy with foreign-born citizens, affiliation with 
the Roman Catholic church, fellowship for the 
" common people," alliance with one national party, 
support of the liquor business all these are inci- 
dental and subordinate. Of course, controlling the 
city funds does not necessarily mean stealing them 
though Mr. Tweed showed quite plainly the pos- 
sibilities in that direction. But Tammany means, at 
best, getting the offices and the salaries and the con- 
tracts and the jobs of all sorts. How much more it 
means in that same line of pecuniary profit is one of 
those things, as Lord Dundreary would say, " which 
no fellow can find out." But before and above all 
else, Tammany is the incarnation of the spoils sys- 
tem in politics. If that is a good and a necessary 
system, then Tammany Hall is merely the natural 
and laudable efflorescence of our democratic society. 
If that system is radically needless and vicious, then 
Tammany is simply one of its sheet-anchors to wind- 
ward. 

This fact of the identity of Tammany with the 
spoils system has an immediate bearing on another 
consideration. Tammany cannot be overthrown by 
any mere revolt against the organization. An al- 
liance of anti-Tammany democrats with the Repub- 
lican organization of the city is no more than a tem- 
porary expedient. The victory of a rival machine 
such as Fernando Wood's "Mozart Hall," just 
before the war is merely the perpetuation of Tam- 
many methods under another name. In other words, 
the thing to attack is not the organization, but the 
system which is the life of the organization. Tam- 
many is not a disease ; it is merely a symptom a cu- 
taneous eruption indicative of poisoned blood. And 
if the system of spoils in city offices can be destroyed, 
Tammany Hall will vanish into the air. 

Whether such destruction is possible, may per- 
haps fairly be questioned. But it is quite sure that 
it will never be at all likely so long as city elections 
are conducted by the machinery of national politics. 
If we can get rid of national politics in local elec- 
tions, we may be able to find something better than 
the spoils system. If we can break down the spoils 
system, Tammany will at once become innocuous, 
and its braves may celebrate the season of flowers 
in peace. The ghost" of Tweed will be laid.

many is increase in righteousness. No doubt that 
would do. But it will take considerable righteous- 
ness to purify Tammany Hall. 

A new revision of Mr. Andrew Carnegie's " Tri- 
umphant Democracy," with the numerous figures 
adjusted to the census of 1890, is evidence that 
there is a demand for the canny Scotchman's op- 
timism, notwithstanding Homestead. Mr. Fuller, 
in " The Cliff Dwellers," speaks of a Chicagoan's 
favorite occupation as talking about his city to a 
stranger. And fully a half-century ago, young Mar- 
tin Chuzzlewit was meaningly informed by one of 
the solemn Western Americans of that day that 
" We has to be cracked up." Mr. Carnegie certainly 
pounds the drum and toots the horn with great skill 
and volume of sound. His theme is the general 
bigness of the Republic; and he piles up figures 
and rattles off adjectives with the enthusiastic aban- 
don of a Western real-estate agent. The late Mr. 
Disraeli once referred to Mr. Gladstone as " a so- 
phistical rhetorician, inebriated by the exuberance 
of his own verbosity." One is inclined to fit the 
coat on Mr. Carnegie, letting it out in spots : " A 
sophistical statistician, inebriated by the exuberance 
of his own statistical fecundity." He oozes figures 
at every pore. He points on nearly every page to 
totals so tall that it makes one dizzy to look at 
them. The reader feels inclined to sympathize with 
the honest Englishman who set out from New York 
to cross the continent, but came back having gone no 
farther than Salt Lake, explaining that he was dis- 
couraged by " the blarsted bigness of the country." 

Wendell Phillips, in his lecture on " The Lost 
Arts," reminds us of the German whom Coleridge 
met at Frankfort. He always took off his hat with 
profound respect when he ventured to speak of him- 
self. Mr. Phillips adds, " It seems to me the Amer- 
ican people might be painted in the chronic attitude 
of taking off its hat to itself." 

The achievements of the American democracy 
have been very great, no doubt. The world has 
never before seen a virgin continent occupied by a 
vast migration of civilized men armed with all the 
appliances by which human power has in these last 
decades been so vastly multiplied. There have been 
other historic race movements. But the German 
Franks who went out west so many centuries ago 
and preempted homesteads in Gaul did not have 
railroads or newspapers or steam threshing-machines. 
They created a great nation, to be sure ; but it took 
a thousand years to do it. We have created a 
greater nation, and it has only taken us a hundred 
years. And we do enjoy bragging about it. 

But are we quite sure that it is a greater nation 
which we have made ? Are we sure that we have 
the right unit with which to measure greatness ? If 
the unit is square miles, or millions of people, or 
dollars, it is all plain sailing. A little of Mr. Car- 
negie's arithmetic will do the business. And there 
is no manner of doubt that we do dearly love big- 
ness. Chicago has a greater area than London, 



has taller buildings than Paris, packs more hogs than 
Rome. Ergo . To be sure, the Louvre is lack- 
ing, and the British Museum. But we are big 
so big! 

Mr. Carnegie's book needs to be read with cau- 
tion. The truth is that in America our real tasks 
have just begun. To succeed with them we shall need 
all the rude strength which we have thus far lavished 
so prodigally and we shall need fineness of mind 
and delicacy of touch as well. We shall need all 
the wide diffusion of knowledge which our schools 
and newspapers afford but we need knowledge 
much deeper and more exact than come from either. 
It wouldn't hurt us if we had less bragging and 
more books less show and fuss and more honest 
living less pork and more scholars. An old defi- 
nition was, " Gentleman one who eats more than 
he earns." That fits exactly both extremes of our 
social organism the pauper tramp and the mil- 
lionaire tramp. The wise man will consider both 
with grave attention, not for themselves, but for 
what they mean. Material obstacles we have over- 
come easily. How will our materialistic democracy 
handle social difficulties which have perplexed the 
wisest men and the greatest nations ? 

A disputed question of our political history so re- 
cent as 1871 is the subject of an interesting little 
volume by Mr. Bancroft Davis. It will be remem- 
bered that at the organization of the Senate of the 
United States in March of that year, Charles Sum- 
ner, long the chairman of the Committee on For- 
eign relations, was displaced in favor of Simon 
Cameron. This act of the Republican majority in 
the Senate has been claimed by Mr. Sumner's friends 
to have been in revenge for that gentleman's stren- 
uous and successful opposition to President Grant's 
policy of annexation in San Domingo. On behalf 
of the President and of Secretary Fish, on the other 
hand, it has been asserted that Mr. Sumner was re- 
moved from the chairmanship on account of his rad- 
ical disagreement with the administration in refer- 
ence to the claims against England, the settlement 
of which was then pending. 

Mr. Sumner had insisted, in a speech in the Sen- 
ate in April, 1869, that the English recognition of 
Confederate belligerency was itself an act which 
made that nation responsible for any resulting dam- 
age in the United States. Then, in estimating the 
amount of damages, besides computing the direct 
value of the ships destroyed by the Southern cruisers 
fitted out in England at about $15,000,000, Mr. 
Sumner added a claim for our loss of the carrying 
trade, estimating that at about $110,000,000. And 
to cap the climax he declared that the action of En- 
gland had doubled the duration, and hence the cost, 
of the war. As that cost was about $4,000,000,- 
000, it followed that half that was justly due from 
England, if the theory was correct. 

Of course for the United States to insist on such 
claims would have meant that any peaceable settle- 
ment would be impossible. England would have 



216 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



incurred the risk of war with the United States 
rather than pay amounts so enormous. President 
Grant and Secretary Fish were content to place 
the English responsibility merely on official negli- 
gence in allowing the Confederate vessels to sail in 
the first instance, and on aid given them subsequently 
in British ports. The damages they did not desire 
to extend beyond the direct loss. 

But in January, 1871, when negotiations with 
Great Britain were assuming shape, Secretary Fish 
consulted the Massachusetts Senator to get a final 
statement of his views. These were embodied by 
Mr. Sumner in a memorandum dated January 17, 
1871. He retained emphatically the extreme ground 
he had already assumed, and now added the sugges- 
tion that the readiest solution of all matters in dis- 
pute would be for England to cede Canada, in 
short, u To make the settlement complete, the with- 
drawal should be from this hemisphere, including 
provinces and islands." Such a scheme of settle- 
ment might have been practicable had it come at 
the close of a victorious war against Great Britain. 
It was certainly chimerical under the conditions 
prevailing in 1871. True, English relations with 
Russia at that time were such as to make a settle- 
ment of troublesome disputes with the United States 
highly desirable*. But to secure India against a 
possible danger by the surrender of America, or to 
avert the cost of a contingent war by a contribution 
equal to the cost of an actual one, was hardly to be 
expected. 

Under these circumstances it certainly made for 
the success of a peaceful settlement to have another 
chairman at the head of the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. And Mr. Davis makes a plausi- 
ble case in showing the development of the breach 
between Mr. Sumner and the administration, and 
the apparently irreconcilable nature of those differ- 
ences. However, he does not attempt to prove 
which indeed might be difficult of proof that aside 
from this grave question of public policy the smart 
of the successful opposition to other administrative 
plans may have made it much easier for supporters 
of the President to realize the pressing importance 
of a change in the committee. And the precise fit- 
ness of Mr. Simon Cameron to succeed Mr. Sum- 
ner would be an interesting matter of inquiry. The 
political bearing of the quarrel between President 
Grant and a portion of the Republican party did 
not become quite obvious till much later. The 
grotesque nomination of Greeley in 1872 prevented 
present danger to Republican ascendancy. But yet 
this break in the party was the " beginning of woes." 
Ten years later it was followed by the second great 
quarrel among leaders. And these dissensions dis- 
rupted the party. The history of the Federalists 
in 1800 was repeated in 1884. 

As to Mr. Sumner's position on the main ques- 
tion, it must be admitted that it had the sympathy 
of the American people very generally. The un- 
friendly, selfish, and malicious conduct of Great 



Britain during our Civil War sank very deep into 
the public consciousness. There is no manner of 
doubt that the moral and material support which 
the South received from England did greatly pro- 
long the war, and did add largely to its cost in life 
and property. This was felt very bitterly at the 
North, and there was no time from 1865 until 1871 
at which a war with England would not have been 
an exceedingly popular measure. In fact, war 
would have been regarded by many as far prefera- 
ble to any money compensation. There are some 
injuries in private life for which it is commonly 
felt that law affords no adequate redress, and for 
which retribution in blood, stern and speedy, is the 
only possible atonement. This may not be the most 
advanced civilization, but it is an elemental instinct 
of human nature. And that feeling to this day 
modifies the regard of great masses of Americans 
for Great Britain. The settlement affected by the 
treaty of Washington was undoubtably a wise act 
of statesmanship. Imperfect as it was, it was bet- 
ter to accept it as final, and to close the account. 
National revenges are better unsatisfied. But it is 
not easy to forget. And Mr. Sumner in 1871 was 
a more accurate interpreter of the popular feeling 
than was Secretary Fish. 

Mr. Tuckerman's life of Judge Jay is a contribu- 
tion to the history of a peculiar phase of the aboli- 
tion movement. It exhibits the share in that move- 
ment taken by a man of excellent birth, of inherited 
wealth, of high religious and intellectual culture, 
and at the same time of great sanity and sweetness 
of character. Such men were not many among the 
agitators; and the course of Judge Jay throws in 
strong relief the erratic and fanatical tendencies 
which did so much to stamp the name Abolitionist 
with contempt. 

The son of Chief Justice John Jay, a graduate of 
Yale College in the year which witnessed the incep- 
tion of Jefferson's embargo, a churchman high in the 
counsels of the Protestant Episcopal church in the 
State of New York, a jurist of so great purity and 
ability that for a quarter of a century he was con- 
tinued on the bench by appointment from govern- 
ors irrespective of party, these are the outward 
features of the life of William Jay. Early inter- 
ested in the question of freedom for the slave, his 
pen was active in disseminating ideas of emancipa- 
tion. But he was from the outset firmly of the 
opinion that interference with slavery in the States 
in which it existed was wholly beyond the constitu- 
tional power of Congress. That power, he held, 
could be exerted only to abolish the institution in 
the District of Columbia and in the territories, and 
to put a stop to the inter-state trade in human beings. 

This constitutional doctrine was very conserva- 
tive in the view of the advanced abolitionists. It 
was essentially the ground on which the Republican 
party was formed later, and was the only possible 
ground for political action against slavery, short of 
revolution and civil war. But it was with great dif-

THE DIAL

ficulty that the American Anti-Slavery Society was 
held to this view of the question. Reformers tend 
to become extremists, and Judge Jay found his 
abolition associates becoming more and more rest- 
ive under any declaration of principles short of 
root-and-branch extermination. 

There was another difficulty. In the view of a 
variety of people, society needs reforming in a va- 
riety of ways. And a mind which has once for all 
adjusted itself to some radical social reconstruction 
has usually so effectually thrown itself out of adjust- 
ment with what is that it fits in readily with almost 
any scheme of alleged reform. And so all sorts of 
" isms " in which the decades before the Civil War 
were so prolific naturally attached themselves to 
the Abolition movement. Women's rights, dress 
reform, food reform, temperance, table-tipping, com- 
munism, all sorts of odds and ends of social vaga- 
ries, become thoroughly mixed up with Abolitionism. 
The resolutions of Anti- Slavery societies became 
more and more turgid and multifarious. And peo- 
ple in general came to associate the Abolition cause 
with the general domain of crankdom. All this 
must be taken into account in trying to understand 
the odium which attached to the name Abolitionist 
among so many excellent people. It was not pure 
wickedness which caused the violent opposition to the 
Anti-Slavery movement in New England and New 
York and other free States. If that cause could 
have been kept clear of " entangling alliances " with 
other " causes " good, bad, indifferent, immoral, 
whimsical, what not, Abolitionism would have 
quite a different savor. 

Judge Jay devoted all his large influence and 
clear intelligence to keeping opposition to slavery 
independent of other movements, and within consti- 
tutional lines. When he saw that the American 
Anti-Slavery Society was hopelessly in the hands of 
the professional " reformers," he withdrew, and 
aided in forming another association. He always 
opposed the disunion schemes of some Abolitionists 
and the "no government" policy of others. The 
Constitution, the Union, lawful methods these he 
held adequate to a reasonable movement against the 
system of human slavery. And his constant efforts 
were given to the effort to hold the friends of Abo- 
lition in this impregnable position. He lived long 
enough to see a great national party founded on his 
principles a party destined to destroy slavery with- 
out destroying the Union. His death in 1857 was 
too soon for him to share in the great events which 
at last made the Republic the home of free men. 
But it cannot be doubted that his was a powerful in- 
fluence in giving shape to that wise popular view of 
the case which in the end was able to deal with 
slavery. Jay and Lincoln and Seward, not Garri- 
son and Phillips and John Brown, represent the 
Anti-Slavery force which put the Thirteenth Amend- 
ment into the Constitution. 

Twenty-five years ago, but little attention had 
been given to the study of political history in 



America. Since then there has been a renascence 
of patriotic scholarship, and the scientific method 
has been applied with energy and intelligence to 
the study of our own institutions. The patient and 
minute work which has been encouraged at Johns 
Hopkins and Columbia has already sufficed to 
amass material which will be of priceless value to 
the historian. Three of these studies are before us. 
Mr. Bishop's " History of Elections in the Ameri- 
can Colonies " is a valuable compilation from the 
early laws and records, and will be of decided help 
in tracing the form taken by the elective franchise 
in our early State constitutions. Mr. Steiner's " His- 
tory of Slavery in Connecticut " is a contribution 
towards a systematic and scientific study of that in- 
stitution in the United States a work which still 
remains to be done. The study of " Local Govern- 
ment in the South and the Southwest," by Prof. E. 
W. Bemis and students of Vanderbilt University, is 
an example of what may be done by college stu- 
dents when their work is directed to a purpose. A 
more exact bibliography would add to the value 
of the work. Mr. Haynes' paper on " Popular 
Election of U. S. Senators " is an argument for that 
method. It should be timely reading just now in 
many quarters. HARRY PRATT JUDSON. 



BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS. 

Dr. William Wright's "The Brontes 
A graphic picture in i re i an a (Appleton) is a rarely 

oflnshhfe. . r i i I u 

interesting book, almost as much so, 
to our notion, as the best of the novels which have 
made the Bronte name famous. (And touching 
this name we may add that Dr. Wright decides 
once for all that it is and always was BrontS not 
" Brunty," or the still more ignominious " Prunty," 
as some authorities have it. " Brunty," however, 
seems to have been the local Irish pronunciation.) 
We have several Lives of the author of "Jane Eyre " 
Mrs. Gaskell's, Mr. Wemyss Reid's, and Mr. 
Birrell's, each capital in its way; but it has re- 
mained, we believe, for the present author to trace 
the current of Bronte life back to Ireland, and to 
explore its head-waters there. This he has done 
with patience, enthusiasm, and literary skill ; and 
the result is a book that is not only satisfactory 
from a biographical standpoint, but is a strikingly 
fresh and graphic picture of Irish rural life as well. 
The Doctor is a capital hand at a story. Thrilling 
indeed almost Homeric is his account of the 
combat between Welsh Bronte and Sam Clarke of 
Ballynaskeagh an era-making event even in County 
Down, and, in a way, the Hegira of the local cal- 
endar. " Women," he says, " would speak of their 
children as born or their daughters married so 
many years before or after the fight, and old men 
in referring to their ages would tell how they had 
been present when Welsh Bronte licked Sam. Clarke, 
and that they must have been of such an age at the

time." We are glad to record, to the Bronte honor, 
that the victor, more magnanimous than Achilles, 
bore the defeated Samuel home in his arms, and put 
him to bed for bodily repairs. Striking, too, is the 
picture of stern Hugh Bronte, Charlotte's uncle, as 
he prepared his new blackthorn and crossed to En- 
gland to wreak Irish vengeance on the scoundrel 
who traduced his niece's honor in the infamous 
" Quarterly " review of " Jane Eyre ": " Hugh had 
for many years been watching over the growth of a 
young blackthorn sapling, as if it had been an only 
child. It had arrived at maturity about the time 
the diabolical article appeared in the 'Quarterly.' 
The supreme moment of his life had arrived, and 
the weapon on which he depended was ready. . . . 
His first act was to dig up the blackthorn carefully, 
so that he might have enough of the thick root to 
form a lethal club. Having pruned it roughly, he 
placed the butt end in warm ashes night after night 
to season. Then, when it had become sapless and 
hard, he reduced it to its final dimensions. After- 
wards he steeped it in brine, or ' put it in pickle ' 
as the saying goes; and when it had been a suffi- 
cient time in the salt water, he took it out and 
rubbed it with shamois and train oil for hours. 
Then came the final process. He shot a magpie, 
drained its blood into a cup, and with the lappered 
blood polished the blackthorn till it became glossy 
black with a mahogany tint. . . . No Sir Galahad 
ever valued his shield, or trusted his spear, as Hugh 
Bronte cherished and loved his shillelagh." Dr. 
Johnson's memorable preparations for Ossian Mac- 
pherson were nothing to this. Dr. Wright adds an 
interesting chapter concerning the long-disputed 
identity of the rascally reviewer in question, and he 
seems to have solved the mystery satisfactorily. 
For the culprit's name, and for the degree of his or 
her responsibility in the case, we must refer the 
reader to the original. 

Historical Professor John Bascom's "Histor- 

interpretations ical Interpretation of Philosophy " 
of Philosophy. (p utn am) would make an excellent 
course of lectures for the senior class of a minor 
college, whom it was not desirable to feed on too 
strong meat. Are we mistaken in suspecting that 
much of the material of the book has already seen 
service in this way ? It presents a judicious but not 
burdensome selection of facts from Ueberweg, and a 
sensible pleasantly written commentary which warns 
the student against pernicious tendencies of thought, 
and directs him into the safe via media of an in- 
tuitionist realism, avoiding the dangerous extremes 
of monistic idealism and monistic materialism. The 
style is easy and flowing, and in places prettily fig- 
urative, reminding us occasionally of Dr. Martineau, 
to whom Professor Bascom will not object to be 
compared. The various systems passed in review 
are judged mainly by their tendencies, and approved 
of or condemned according as they approach or di- 
verge from the standard of what the author, although 
he nowhere defines it, clearly feels to be the true 



philosophy. It is asserted in the introduction that 
" all conclusions that lie beyond the primary con- 
victions of men will be found aberrations, vagaries." 
Punctilious historical accuracy was perhaps hardly 
compatible with the main design of the work. But 
it is a little startling to find Berkeley removed from 
his true position in the development between Locke 
and Hume, and classed with Lord Herbert of Cher- 
bury, Clark, and Dr. Martineau among the dissent- 
ers from the predominant school of English philos- 
ophy. The exigencies of Professor Bascom's method 
have led him, we fear, into unintentional injustice 
towards the estimable Locke. " He raised the ques- 
tion," we are told, " ' Does matter think ? ' Why 
not, pray, if the mind be material ? Can things fly ? 
Why not, if flying is being hurled from a catapult? " 
But surely Professor Bascom is aware that Locke 
never asserted the possibility of matter thinking as 
an ultimate metaphysical principle. He declared 
that, for aught we know, God might have arbitra- 
rily annexed to a certain arrangement of matter the 
power of thought, but he explicitly denied that the 
divine thought itself could result from any disposi- 
tion of material particles. In other words, he af- 
firmed that thought could ultimately originate only 
in mind. " Dear old Locke," as Professor James 
calls him, has often before been misrepresented 
upon this point, and is likely to be so again. 

" How to Study and Teach History," 
A practical look (Appleton), a duodecimo of three 

for history teachers. , v , , ' , , 

hundred and forty-six pages, appears 
in the " International Education " series, whereof 
Dr. William T. Harris is editor. This volume, by 
Professor Burke A. Hinsdale of the University, 
of Michigan, is introduced by a delicious bit of 
Hegelianism by Dr. Harris, and a brief preface 
by the author, who says that he has had in mind 
more particularly the needs of teachers in element- 
ary and in secondary schools, though he thinks much 
of the work should interest teachers of history in 
colleges. He calls it a practical work, " not indeed 
in the narrow mechanical sense of the word : no 
effort is made to tell the teacher just what he shall 
teach or just how he shall teach it." The wisdom 
shown in that statement appears throughout the 
book in many valuable suggestions of method,. the 
author recognizing the fact that every good teacher 
is his own method, while the best may learn from 
others. He discusses the educational value of his- 
tory ; its field ; its sources ; choice of facts ; organ- 
ization of facts into history : time, place, cause, and 
effect in history, both physical causes and spiritual 
or human. There are valuable chapters on histor- 
ical geography. Then, as the book is for the ben- 
efit of that large number of teachers who in that 
function are never called to go beyond the history of 
the United States, Professor Hinsdale proceeds to 
exemplify his methods and philosophy in one hun- 
dred and twenty-two pages on North America and 
the United States. There is an abundant suggestion 
of books to be read or consulted. We have thus

given an outline of the book as the best beginning 
of a criticism of it. For the ordinary reader, and still 
more for the teacher, it is a very valuable book. We 
have read with interest many of its pages, and young 
teachers will find all the book helpful and instruct- 
ive. The chapter on the Slave-Power shows in a 
good light Dr. Hinsdale's judicial qualities of mind. 
He writes good English, not ornate or rhetorical, 
but clear and forceful. We have found but a sin- 
gle sentence to alter: on page 122 he says the sea 
was " not too far off to prevent " trade : he means 
the opposite "not so far off as to prevent " trade. 
And surely on the next page he should prefer Aqui- 
leia to the rarer and hardly correct form Aquilia. 
When a new edition is called for, will he not favor 
us with a bibliographical index ?

She came as near, in fact, as any woman has done 
in this country to the maintenance of a salon in 
the Parisian sense. Her own literary work included 
a useful compendium of the history of general lit- 
erature, a considerable number of poems, and many 
productions of a more fugitive character. How 
happy she was in her friends appears from the list 
of those whose personal tributes make up the first 
half of this memorial volume. There are contribu- 
tions from Messrs. A. D. White, S. Parke Godwin, 
James A. Froude, Justin McCarthy, E. C. Sted- 
man, Charles Dudley Warner, R. W. Gilder, Mrs. 
Julia Ward Howe, Miss Edith M. Thomas, and 
many others. Professor Froude, for example, writes : 
" I have known many interesting women in my life, 
but about her there is a peculiar grace which I have 
never seen in any other person." This tribute may 
be taken as typical of all the collection, which leaves 
unstruck few notes in the whole gamut of possible 
praise. Mrs. Botta, among other good works, it seems, 
"discovered" Miss Edith M. Thomas. "When 
Miss Thomas presented herself at Mrs. Botta's door, 
she was entirely unknown ; but the portfolio of man- 
uscripts she had under her arm made it impossible 
for her to remain so any longer. Mrs. Botta de- 
tected the divine spark, and passed the poet on to 
that other poet, Helen Jackson ('H. H.'), who set 
herself to work at once to make Miss Thomas known 
to the world." The second half of this memorial 
volume includes letters to and from Mrs. Botta 
(among her correspondents having been Kossuth, 
Emerson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, George 
Ticknor, Frederika Bremer, and "Fanny Kem- 
ble "), and selections from her writings in prose and 
verse. The volume makes a pleasing impression, 
and enshrines a personality that was clearly of the 
most lovable sort. The editing has not always been 
done with accuracy, as is witnessed by the descrip- 



tion of Frederika Bremer as a " Norwegian," and 
by the curious reference (p. 203) to "Arnold's 
scholar, Gypsey." Messrs. J. Selwin Tait & Sons 
publish the work. 

A compact yet comprehensive Life 
^ tnat an " a kl e man an d, in his way, 
great painter, Sir Joshua Reynolds, 
has long been a desideratum. Such a life is that 
written by Mr. Claude Phillips, and imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Mr. Phillips is a 
competent art-writer, and his summary of Sir Joshua's 
merits is, on the whole, just and discriminating. 
He notes en passant the grain of truth in shrewd 
Horace Walpole's paradox contained in his par- 
allel between Sir Joshua and Allan Ramsay that 
"Mr. Reynolds seldom succeeds in women: Mr. 
Ramsay is formed to paint them." To say that 
" Reynolds seldom succeeds in women " is of course 
an over -statement. Says Mr. Phillips: "Where 
Reynolds approached nearest to greatness, and 
showed a measure of that much-abused word genius, 
was in the presentment of the great men who were 
his friends, and for observing whom, in every phase 
and every mood, he had all through his career op- 
portunities unequalled by those afforded to any 
artist of his time." Mr. Phillips's observation is 
a very just one. Gracious and charming as Sir 
Joshua's women and children nearly always are, 
they still fall short (not excepting even the superb 
" Nelly O'Brien ") of such masterpieces as the por- 
traits of Dr. Johnson, Sterne, Sir Joseph Banks, 
and, farthest of all, of the pathetic picture of Gold- 
smith, in which the artist has succeeded, without 
sacrificing truth, in conjuring away the traditional 
homeliness, whim, and absurdity, leaving for pos- 
terity the underlying kindliness, modesty, and worth. 
"I shall never think Dr. Goldsmith ugly again," 
said a lady after reading " The Deserted Village." 
Certainly no one could think him ugly after seeing 
Reynolds's portrait. Every face, the plainest, lights 
up at times, under the proper emotion, into a de- 
gree of beauty and dignity ; and Reynolds seemed 
to have the gift of evoking this look in his sitters, 
and of fixing it upon his canvas. Mr. Phillips's 
book combines biography, criticism, and anecdote in 
due proportion, and the photographic plates after 
Reynolds are pleasing and well-chosen.

A new edition . , 

of " The Social and inexpensive edition ot Rousseau s 
Contract." a g oc ial Contract " is a useful and, 

in a special sense, a timely publication. Professor 
Huxley and others have pointed out the fact that 
Rosseauism, so far from being dead, is coming to 
the front again, and bids fair once more to exert a 
grave influence on practical life. It is easy at this 
day to criticise, from the " hard fact " standpoint, 
the Contrat Social; to point out its contradictions, 
its impracticabilities, the hopeless disagreement with 
ascertained facts of its theory of society. It is no 
less easy to show that, underlying its errors of lit-

eral detail, is a ground-work of moral truth, a body 
of logically-flawless abstract principles that to the 
end of time will continue, in one foi-m or another, 
to justify revolt against social and political injus- 
tice. In proportion as the natural inequalities of 
men ripen into the iniquities of caste and tyranny, 
so will the gospel of Jean Jacques, or this or that 
rendering of it, grow in favor. Its errors of fact 
will finally be once more cast to the winds by those 
in need of a theoretical justification for the doing 
away of a greater by the perpetration of a lesser in- 
justice. Professor Huxley hints that Rousseauism, 
with modern variations, has been coming into fash- 
ion at a rather alarming rate of late. If this be 
true, there is no surer sign of the growth of abuses 
which pave the way for it and render it acceptable. 
Certainly readers of the present volume will not fail 
to note that the views of our modern political a-pri- 
orists essentially coincide with those held long ago 
by the Savoyard Vicar and applied by Robespierre 
and Saint Just with what results, immediate and 
net, the world knows. The present edition of " The 
Social Contract " is well translated by Miss Rose M. 
Harrington, and Professor E. L. Walter furnishes 
a really luminous critical and historical introduction. 

Dr. Walter B. Scaife's " Florentine 
23SSJ 1 LifedringtheRenaissance"(Johns 

Hopkins Press) is the work of an 
American who has spent some time abroad and 
been attracted by the charm which Florence has 
always possessed for " those who live by thought." 
The volume derives its interest from the material 
which it contains rather than from any special ex- 
cellence of style or method of treatment. The au- 
thor's style is awkward and at times obscure, and 
the generalizations which he deals out, in order to 
make the book " helpful amidst the trials and com- 
plications of modern life," are usually of a common- 
place and superficial sort. Authorities are not 
always used with proper discrimination ; Roscoe is 
frequently referred to, and in one case Webster's 
Dictionary is quoted as a better authority than 
Burckhardt. Even a slight acquaintance with the 
correspondence of the fifteenth century would have 
prevented such a mistake as occurs on page 84, 
where the use of the common form " I recommend 
myself always to you," at the close of a letter from 
the wife of Lorenzo de' Medici to her husband, is 
said to show lack of conjugal affection, and the 
phrase characterized as " an expression which a per- 
son seeking office or favor might adopt." 

William Blake was a man who in his 
character and in his poetry was so 
unlike an ordinary genius (if so an- 
omalous an expression may be used) that it seems 
extremely hard to write a biography or criticism of 
him that shall be impartial and sympathetic too. 
Especially does sympathy with his work incline a 
writer to hold a brief for him. Mr. Alfred T. 
Story's sympathetic study of his mystical subject is 



no exception to the rule. The book " William 
Blake : His Life, Character, and Genius " (Mac- 
millan ) is a special plea, full of animated super- 
latives whose very passion deprives them of per- 
suasiveness. The happenings of the poet's life are 
rather diffusely told, and the rest of the book is 
given to a running commentary on his poems. Mr. 
Story rightly praises the few beautiful things that 
Blake wrote, and interprets, probably as well as 
anyone could, the incoherent mass that remains. 
Waiving Blake's power as an artist, and thinking 
of him merely as a literary man, a reader who had 
previously deemed the mystic half-mad would rise 
from the perusal of the book deeming him three- 
fourths so. But that is only another way of saying 
that this book is not the final interpretation of the 
man. 

An attractive number of the pretty 
j* "Dilettante Library" series (Mac- 

millan) is Mr. Walter Jerrold's criti- 
cal and biographical study of Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
Mr. Jerrold writes with warmth as well as discrim- 
ination, and his pages are very liberally peppered 
with quotation and anecdote. From the verbal por- 
traits cited we select the following, which describes 
the Doctor as he appeared to a Scotchman who 
heard him lecture in the sixties : " Holmes is a plain 
little dapper man, his short hair brushed down like 
a boy's, but turning gray now ; a trifle of f urzy hair 
under his ears ; a powerful jaw, and a thick, strong 
underlip that gives decision to his look, with a dash 
of pertness. In conversation he is animated and 
cordial sharp, too, taking the word out of one's 
mouth." The last touch rather bears out " the land- 
lady's" view of her Autocratic boarder: "He was 
a well-behaved gentleman at table, only talked a 
good deal, and pretty loud sometimes, and had a 
way of turnin' up his nose when he did n't like what 
folks said, that one of my boarders, who is a very 
smart young man, said he couldn't stand, nohow, 
and used to make faces and poke fun at him, when- 
ever he see him do it." The volume contains a 
bibliography and a fair portrait.

first volume covers the first five letters of the al- 
phabet. Some expansion beyond the original plan 
is already manifest, since the early announcements 
contemplated but twelve or fourteen parts. As the 
several instalments of this work have appeared, its 
great usefulness has become more and more appar- 
ent. It does not conflict in any way with Cherbu- 
liez or with Lalor, its scope being more restricted, 
and its articles at once more numerous and more

relation in plan as is borne by the new Chambers's

" Paragraph- Writing," by Professors 
The art of writing Fred N> gcott and Joseph V. Denney 

paragraphs. . n 

(Allyn & Bacon), is one of the really 
practical books there are not many of them - on 
English composition. It is a book that has already 
stood the test of classroom use, and the theory on 
which it is founded must be deemed established. 
The theory is novel and definite : the way to learn 
to write English is first to learn to write paragraphs. 
To teach this art is the object of the book. Part I. 
deals with the nature and laws of the paragraph; 
first, as an independent piece of discourse the 
isolated paragraph, and second, the paragraph as 
one of a series. Part II. briefly discusses the theory 
of the paragraph ; and Part III. furnishes the teacher 
with an abundance of material for classroom work 
selected paragraphs, hints on teaching, a list of 
about two thousand subjects, and useful references 
of many kinds. It is a book that successfully illus- 
trates the three articles of the rhetorician's creed 
theory, example, and practice. 

The publication of Mr. Huxley's col- 
Two new volumes i ecte( j essays (Appleton) is continued 

from Mr. Huxley. i L j 

with two volumes devoted, respect- 
ively, to " Science and Hebrew Tradition " and 
" Science and Christian Tradition." These volumes 
contain all of the author's contributions to the con- 
troversy into which he has been drawn of late years 
by the over-zealous champions of an over-literal 
Christian theology. They exhibit the author's po- 
lemic at its best, and will doubtless have a certain 
permanence as examples of brilliant controversial 
writing. The popular and unscientific forms of the- 
ological belief towards which Mr. Huxley's attack 
is directed no longer, of course, claim the assent of 
really serious thinkers even among professional the- 
ologians, and it may be said that Voltaire suffit for 
all that sort of thing. But for the battle of truth 
with superstition each age must forge its own wea- 
pons, and Mr. Huxley has shown himself an accom- 
plished artificer. Each of these volumes has a 
preface written for the collective edition, that of the 
latter volume being considerably the more lengthy 
of the two. . 

The pleasantly- Mr- Richard Le GWlienne's account 
stated faith of " The Religion of a Literary Man 

of an optimist. (Putnam) is a pleasantly-written es- 
say, which shows the author to have thought seri- 
ously if not deeply upon the most important of hu- 
man concerns. This religlo scriptoris is a very un- 
dogmatic sort of faith, so vaguely expressed that the 
most liberal-minded will find little difficulty in ac- 
cepting it, if, indeed, it do not appear to be made 
up of the merest truisms. Occasionally the author 
registers a most amazing judgment, as when he calls 



Schopenhauer " a small philosopher," with an " in- 
effably petty and uncomfortable disposition." Un- 
comfortable, possibly, or rather uncomf orting, to the 
mild optimist of Mr. Le Gallienne's type, but not 
exactly petty. Such vagaries, however, are not of 
the essence of the author's doctrine, which is, for 
the most part, as sweetly reasonable as even Arnold 
could have wished. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. H. S. Salt's " Richard Jefferies " (" Dilettante 
Library," Macmillan) is a concise and soberly-written 
study, critical rather than biographical, which may be 
read to advantage in connection with Mr. Besant's de- 
lightful, if rather over-charged, " Eulogy." The author 
discusses, very briefly, Jefferies as " Man," as " Natural- 
ist," " Thinker," " Writer," etc., presenting what seems 
to be the net result of current criticism, with a due 
measure of shrewd comment and observation of his own. 
There is a useful appendix, and a portrait of Jefferies, 
the expression of which confirms in a way what has been 
said regarding his being a far less agreeable companion 
as a man than as a writer. 

M. Paul Gaulot's spirited Life of Count Fersen, Marie 
Antoinette's chivalrous Swedish ally and admirer, loses 
little if anything of its charm in Mrs. Cashel Hoey's 
capital translation, lately issued by Messrs. D. Appleton 
& Co. under the title " A Friend of the Queen." Re- 
cent disclosures have enabled M. Gaulot to throw addi- 
tional light upon the romantic episode upon which his 
narrative naturally hinges, as well as upon the charac- 
ters of those most concerned in it. The story of the 
ill-starred flight to Varennes is admirably told, and the 
book altogether forms a not unimportant contribution to 
the annals of the period. There are portraits of Count 
Fersen and the Queen. 

Professor Rawlinson's " Story of Parthia " (Putnam) 
is an adaptation and in many places a close paraphrase 
of his " Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy," which first ap- 
peared more than twenty years ago. The importance 
of the story lies in the clearness with which it brings 
out the character and position of the power which for 
three centuries " balanced Rome, acted as a counter- 
poise and a check, had to be consulted and considered, 
held a place in all men's thoughts, and finally furnished 
a not intolerable refuge to such as had provoked Rome's 
master beyond forgiveness." Such negative forces have 
an influence in history which we too often overlook. 

Mrs. Frances Elliot's "Old Court Life in France," 
which was published some twenty years ago, enjoyed a 
considerable popularity with readers who were not ex- 
acting as to accuracy of statement, and who liked to 
take their history well-diluted and strongly flavored 
with romanticism. The author now puts forth two vol- 
umes of "Old Court Life in Spain" (Scribner), similarly 
told, and likely to attract the same sort of audience. It 
tells us of the Moors, of Bernardo del Carpio and the 
Cid, and of various kings and other potentates down to 
the times of Ferdinand and Isabella. The manner of 
the telling is both incoherent and stilted, and serious 
readers will not care for the work. 

Modern language texts are multiplying at the usual 
rate. From the Cambridge University Press (Mac- 
millan) we have Delavigne's "Louis XL," edited by

The " Practical Business Book-keeping of Double En-

Boston English High School, appears to be an excep- 
tionally complete and up-to-date presentation of the 
subject, useful not only as a text-book, but also as a 
book of reference and as a self-instructor. The book 
is attractively printed and substantially bound. 

" Letters to Marco " (Macmillan), an attractive little 
volume of letters from George D. Leslie, R.A., to his 
friend H. Stacy Marks, R.A., should appeal to readers 
who love Nature for her own sake and can seek her 
precincts unallured by the proverbial Anglo-Saxon crav- 
ing to " go and kill something." Mr. Leslie's letters 
teem with original and curious observations on plant and 
animal life in the southern counties of England, with 
occasional " asides " on art topics and on the life bu- 
colic in general. The letters are crisply and pleasantly 
written, and there are many wood-cuts, mainly corrected 
reproductions of the original pen-and-ink scribbles. 

Mr. St. George Mivart's "Introduction to the Ele- 
ments of Science " (Little, Brown, & Co.) is a book in- 
tended for the general reader, and not at all like, for 
example, the " Elements of Science " of Professor 
Jevons, although having the same universal scope. 
Mathematics, mechanics, physics, biology, logic, and his- 
tory are the main subjects taken up. Neither Mr. Mi- 
vart's psychology nor his philosophy of history is likely 
to find general acceptance, for the personal equation of 
the writer gives them too marked a coloring; but in the 
simpler matters of physical and biological science he is 
a competent, and usually a trustworthy, guide. 



YORK TOPICS. 

New York, March 36, 1894. 

The publication of Mrs. Ward's " Marcella " will be 
the most significant literary event of the coming week. 
Doubtless this third work of importance will be made 
the criterion of Mrs. Ward's success as a novelist. The 
general impression seems to have been that "David 
Grieve" did not quite fulfil the promise of "Robert 
Elsmere." To my mind, " Marcella " is an a'dvanee, in 
the art of novel-writing, upon both of the former books. 
The story is more connected, and the characters as a 
whole are drawn with greater clearness, although there 
is no one character which equals that of the Squire in 
" Robert Elsmere." The girl of the period, either with 
or without a purpose, seems just now to engross the 
attention of the English-speaking race, and Mrs. Ward 
has hit the spirit of the times very happily with her 
"Marcella." The latter young woman is decidedly 
purposeful, and sets out to reform her part of the world, 



an English country village, along the lines of the new 
Socialism. An engagement to the son of a lord is not 
allowed to interfere with this work, and it is the en- 
gagement and not the work that comes to an end when 
interests clash. I am not sure, however, that Mrs. 
Ward makes the new Socialism attractive, or does it 
full justice. She seems to have studied it " from above," 
as Marcella accuses her lover of doing in the case of a 
condemned poacher. The book is quite as long as the 
two which preceded it, but it is well proportioned, in- 
teresting, and full of material for reflection. Mrs. 
Ward has evidently taken the advice of her critics, for 
the action of the story is not interrupted by long de- 
scriptions of unimportant characters or by digressions 
into the fields of religion and philosophy. 

Edgar Stanton Maclay, whose " History of the United 
States Navy " is just about to be published, is the son 
of the president of the Maclay Theological Seminary of 
Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Syracuse 
University in 1885, having devoted himself particularly 
to the study of history. Since his graduation he has 
been constantly engaged upon this history of the navy. 
He has spent much time in France, where the Minister 
of Marine opened the official archives to him, and also 
in England, where he was aided by the late Admiral 
Provo Wallis, a survivor of the Chesapeake-Shannon 
fight. In this country Mr. Maclay has been given ac- 
cess to many family papers and unpublished documents, 
and has been assisted by Admiral Jouett and other 
naval officers. Mr. Maclay will have an article de- 
scriptive of the cruise of the United States frigate " Po- 
tomac " for the chastisement of the Qualla Battooans 
in 1832, in the May " Harper's." 

In addition to the volumes of the " Ex Libris " series, 
edited by Gleeson White, already mentioned in this 
correspondence, Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce 
"The Decorative Illustration of Books," by Walter 
Crane, " Modern Book Illustration," by Joseph Pennell, 
and " Decorative Heraldry," by G. W. Eve. The in- 
terest in book-lore seems to have culminated with the 
proposed new English bibliographical magazine. 

Interest in Napoleon seems to increase with each suc- 
cessive work relating to his life and surroundings. The 
latest Napoleon volume is the " Memoirs of the Baron 
de Meneval," which Messrs. Appleton are about to pub- 
lish. As private secretary to the emperor from 1802 
to 1814, Baron de Meneval had, of course, special op- 
portunities for observation, which he did not neglect, as 
these selections from his diaries and notes plainly show. 
They have been edited by his grandson. 

The poems of the unfortunate Richard Realf are at 
last to be collected in a volume. Since his suicide at 
Oakland, California, in 1878, there have been several 
announcements of proposed volumes of his poems, but 
none of these has appeared. Meanwhile, Realf's liter- 
ary executor and former comrade, Col. Richard J. Hin- 
ton, has gathered together copies of all the poems that 
could be found, and has awaited a favorable opportunity 
for publication. This has now come about through the 
instrumentality of Col. Alexander T. Hawes, of San 
Francisco, also a comrade of Realf, having commanded 
a regiment in the Army of the Cumberland. " The Po- 
ems of Richard Realf," with a brief biography by Col- 
onel Hinton, will be issued in the Fall under the direc- 
tion of Colonel Hawes, to whose address in the Mills 
Building, San Francisco, subscriptions may be sent. A 
large number has already been received. Colonel Hin- 
ton has collected nearly two hundred poems by Realf,

verses originally published in London as " Guesses at 
Truth." There will be three portraits, one taken dur- 
ing the John Brown period in Kansas, another during 
the War, and the third at a later date. 

In "Joanna Traill, Spinster," Miss Annie E. Holds- 
worth, one of the most popular of the younger English 
novelists, has drawn an interesting picture of rescue 
work in the London slums. Much is expected of this 
book, which will be published in London and New York 
simultaneously on the first of the month. Mr. W. T. 
Stead, who is particularly interested in this author and 
her work, has said of the book, which he saw in manu- 
script, that " It is a tale of London life, painted from 
life, full of the pathos and tragedy and also of the 
brightness and vitality of modern London."

The following Blilow story is from " The Saturday 
Review": "It will be remembered how, some two or 
three years ago, the German Emperor in a speech re- 
ferred rather rudely to the < Grumblers ' (Norgler) at 
the existing regime, and advised all such to shake off 
the dust of the Vaterland's soil. The speech created 
an unusual stir in all circles, and there was a large con- 
tingent of officials and others who took the hint, and 
became known forthwith as Staubdbschuttler. Btilow, 
who had always something to say or to write, held his 
tongue this time ; but, at the first Philharmonic Concert 
he conducted in Berlin, as he stepped on the platform 
he took out a very large handkerchief and in full view of 
the audience began to dust his shoes, just to show that he 
was not satisfied with the existing state of things ! He 
took it also musically out of Count Hochberg when that 
amiable despot had him turned out of the Berlin Opera 
House. It was at a pianoforte recital at the Singacad- 



emie, where, by way of a prelude, Billow just played 
the first few bars of Figaro's aria, ' Se vuol ballare, Sig- 
ner Contino ! ' " 

Perhaps the most extensive literary work ever under- 
taken in this country is the military history now being 
produced by the government of the United States, un-

of the Official Records of the Union and Confeder- 
ate Armies." It was begun just twenty years ago, and 
will be practically finished at the end of the next fiscal 
year. The work when completed will embrace 120 large 
royal octavo volumes of 1000 pages each, and a gigan- 
tic atlas, and the ultimate cost will be something like 
$2,500,000 for the 11,000 copies printed. Up to this 
date eighty-nine serial volumes have been published, 
and about $1,800,000 has been spent in all branches of 
the work, or about $20,000 per volume. The printing 
and binding alone cost $10,000 per volume, while the 
previous preparation of each volume for the printer's 
hands cost an equal sum of $10,000. Something like 
a thousand copies of this work are offered for sale at a 
trifle above actual cost. The price of the eighty-nine 
parts now published is $56.10 in cloth, and $145.10 in 
half morocco. 

A remarkable literary find has been made by the 
American Press Company of Baltimore, in the shape of 
an original first edition of the poems of Edgar Allan 
Poe, one of the rarest books in the world. For many 
years this unique volume was sought in vain by collect- 
ors of rare books, the only copy known to be in exist- 
ence being an imperfect copy in the British Museum. 
Two years ago, a copy was offered at a book auction 
sale in Boston, and, after a lively bidding, was bought 
by a New York dealer for $1,850; it was then sold to 
a private buyer for $2,500, who sent the treasure to 
Paris, where it was exquisitely bound at a cost of $300. 
The copy just discovered by the American Press Com- 
pany was picked up at a second-hand bookstore some 
sixty years ago, and has since remained in the posses- 
sion of the purchaser. It is in an excellent state of 
preservation, and is worth its weight in gold ten times 
over. The title-page reads as follows: 
TAMERLANE, 

and 

Other Poems. 
By a Bostonian. 

Young heads are giddy, and young hearts are warm, 
And make mistakes for manhood to reform. Cowper. 

Boston : 
Calvin F. S. Thomas . . . Printer. 

. 1827. 

A new work by Mr. Ruskin is just being published, 
entitled " Verona, and Other Lectures," and illustrated 
with frontispiece and photogravure plates from draw- 
ings by the author. Of its five chapters, four were pre- 
pared to be delivered as lectures, during Mr. Ruskin's 
tenure of the Slade Professorship at Oxford. One has 
been written since his resignation. The lecture which 
gives its title to the volume, " Verona and Its Rivers," 
was delivered at the Royal Institution in 1870, and is 
now printed in extenso for the first time. The second, 
" The Story of Arachne," dealing with Greek mythology, 
was read at Woolwich in 1870, and has hitherto been 
represented only by a brief report in a daily newspaper. 
" The Tortoise of Aegina " was prepared for the Ox- 
ford course on Greek sculpture, known as " Aratra Pen- 
telici," but it was not delivered, and has remained until 
now in manuscript. The last two chapters of the book 
are connected with the projected series of " Our Fathers

[April 1, 



Have Told Us"; "Candida Casa, treating of the be- 
ginnings of Christianity in Britain," and " Mending the 
Sieve," a lecture on the Cistercians and their architec- 
ture, given at the London Institution in 1882. 

The Department of Philosophy and Education of Co- 
lumbia College announces the early appearance of the 
first of a series of contributions on philosophical, psy- 
chological, and educational subjects that are to appear 
under the editorship of the members of the Department. 
These contributions are not intended to interfere in any 
way with existing journals, to which the members of the 
Department will continue to lend their cordial support 
as heretofore, but the new series will contain: (1) the 
longer and more important dissertations submitted by 
advanced students in philosophy and education, in par- 
tial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of 
Doctor of Philosophy; (2), occasional longer and more 
technical studies by the professors and instructors them- 
selves; (3) reprints from other journals of contributions 
made to them by members of the Department of Phil- 
osophy at Columbia. The contributions will appear at 
irregular intervals, and will be numbered consecutively 
for binding and preservation. The editors propose to 
conform in every respect to the directions regarding 
such publications recently formulated by the Trustees 
of the Columbia University Press. The new contribu- 
tions will appear under the editorial direction of Pro- 
fessors Butler and Cattell and Drs. Hyslop and Far- 
rand. The first of the contributions to appear will be 
entitled " Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi : A Study in the 
Origins of German Realism," by Mr. Norman Wilde, 
A.M. The second will be " Kant's Inaugural Disserta- 
tion of 1770," including a translation of the dissertation, 
together with an elaborate introduction and notes, by 
Professor W. J. Eckoff of the University of Colorado. 
Orders for these numbers, or requests for information 
concerning them, should be addressed to the Department 
of Philosophy at Columbia College. 

THE EDITOR : A STUDY IN NATURAL HISTORY. 

The following notes upon that interesting specimen, 
the common editor, are taken from " The Author" of Lon- 
don: "The common editor is chiefly remarkable for the 
mixture of ferocity and cunning which he displays. He 
lives in a remote cave, or cell, situated in almost inac- 
cessible places, and extremely difficult to find. The 
approach to his lair is commonly invested with swarms 
of the Office-Boy Hornet (see Chapter LXIL), which 
do all in their power to prevent the intrusion of a 
stranger. Strychnine, done up in the form of chocolate 
drops, is probably the best means of destroying these. 
But even when they have been overcome, the zoologist 
is not unlikely to find the lair deserted ; for it is a habit 
of the editor to roam forth in search of food, which he 
does at frequent intervals. Those scientists who have 
made a determined effort to capture an editor, declare 
they have approached his den at all times, from eleven 
in the morning to late in the afternoon, and that they 
have been informed on each occasion that their prey has 
' just stepped out to luncheon,' and is not expected to re- 
turn for several hours. Another well-marked trait in the 
creature's character, and one upon which all writers are 
agreed, is his passion for unused postage stamps, which 
he obtains from innocent contributors in enormous quan- 
tities. Hence a learned Professor has conjectured that 
it is the habit of the editor to lie concealed in his den 
until such time as he has accumulated sufficient stamps 
to secure him a meal, and that he then sallies forth to 



spend these, after which he again rests in hiding until 
another supply of stamps has been obtained. When in 
his den, his favorite employment is tearing up manu- 
script, with the exception of a few especially worthless 
articles, which latter he uses for filling his paper. It 
is also a well-known fact that he puts all the poems he 
receives into a hat, and draws out one or two at random 
for vise from time to time; the rest he destroys. A 
further point observed by many zoologists is the edi- 
tor's fondness for cliques; they do not explain very 
clearly what these are, or how they are formed, but 
their existence is denounced by almost every writer on 
editors. Some facts concerning them will be found in 
a later chapter. It is sufficient to say here that they 
are represented as herds of selfish and incompetent 
monsters, whose only aim is to prevent any recognition 
being given to true genius."

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 1894. 



(READY APRIL IST.) 

Joanna Traill, Spinster. 



BY 



ANNIE E. HOLDSWORTH. 



Miss Holds-worth is one of the most popular 
of the younger English novelists, and in "Joanna 
Traitt, Spinster," she has treated the now widely 
agitated question of individual rescue work 
among fatten women with great power, and at 
the same time with delicacy. The booh presents 
a possible solution of the question, but is prima- 
rily a well-planned and interesting novel. 
Cloth, i2mo; price, $1.25. 



MARK TWAIN'S NEW STORY. 

(READY APRIL 15TH.) 

Tom Sawyer Abroad. 

By HUCK FINN. 
Edited by MARK TWAIN. 

Cloth, square oftavo, 240 pages, with 27 Illus- 
trations from original drawings by 
Dan Beard. Price, $7.50. 

Mr. Andrew Lang has called " The Adventures 
of Huckleherry Finn " the great American novel. 
Certainly there are no characters in modern fiction 
more popular with young and old than Tom Saw- 
yer, Huck Finn, and Nigger Jim. 

A Western professor invents a wonderful flying 
machine, and it is widely announced that on a cer- 
tain day he will make an ascension. Our three 
travellers are, of course, in the machine when it 
starts, and soon find themselves sailing over the 
Atlantic Ocean. They finally land in Africa. 

The opportunities for thrilling and humorous sit- 
uations can readily be imagined. The interest never 
lags, the humor is delightfully spontaneous, and 
there are many strong pathetic touches in the book.

This new book, by the author of those two popular volumes of 
travel, "Across Russia" and " Spanish Cities," gives Dr. Stoddard's

JOSIAH GILBERT HOLLAND. 

A Memoir. With portraits and illustrations. By Mrs.

Mrs. Plunkett's long friendship with Dr. Holland makes her spe- 
cially fitted for the task of describing the sources of his great and 
lasting influence with the "plain people." An unusual interest also 
attaches to the biographical narrative, which describes his early strug-

his own views of his aims and accomplishment, and the testimony 
of his contemporaries to their elevation and importance.

An Army Story. By GEORGE I. PUTNAM. 12mo, $1.25. 
Mr. Putnam's new army story is varied and adventurous in char-

fidelity an interesting picture of Army life on the plains.

A NEW NOVEL BY THE AUTHOR OP "ROBERT ELSMERE." 



MARCELLA. 



With new 



By Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, author of "The History of David Grieve," " Robert Elsmere," etc., etc. 
portrait. In two volumes, small 12mo, cloth, in a box, $2.00. 

" In ' Robert Elsmere ' and ' David Grieve ' a great talent was at work ; but the question whether behind the talent there was that originating 
force which we call genius, was left unanswered. In ' Marcella ' that question is answered beyond a doubt. . . . ' Marcella ' marks a long 
advance in the art of novel-writing. . . . Mrs. Ward has worked through her culture, and found herself ; she speaks at last, in clear, resonant 
tones, out of the depths of her own nature, and her voice is the voice of an artist by the grace of God as well as by the nurture of the schools. 
In ' Marcella,' as in the earlier stories, Mrs. Ward's task is to dramatize the strife of the soul with its inheritance and its conditions. . . . It is 
certainly no accidental interest in what are called burning questions which drew Mrs. Ward ... to that social problem which overshadows 
society, and lies on so many hearts not only as an intolerable mystery but as an intolerable burden. . . . Her real interest is in the problem of 
the personal life. ... In ' Marcella ' Mrs. Ward presents the question of the day in strict subordination to its influence on the nature and 
destiny of a girl of brilliant temperament, deep feeling, intense idealism, and noble but impetuous and untrained character. She exhibits the 
social revolution as it touches a personality of native force and artistic sensitiveness. ... It is with these subtler contacts . . . that art 
legitimately deals ; and it is these aspects of the modern problem which are set forth with marvelous vividness and power in the story of Mar- 
cella's career." Mr. HAMILTON W. MABIE, in The Forum for April. 



By Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD. 



MARCELLA. 



" So many words about the problem with which the story deals must not be suffered to convey the impression that ' Marcella ' is only another 
social study ; it is dramatic in the deepest sense from beginning to end, and more than once its dramatic movement rises to a great height. 
There are passages and scenes in it which in force and intensity come very near the greatest things in English fiction. Indeed, the special quality 
of the story is the passion which vibrates through it ; a passion for truth, a passion of sympathy, and at the end a passion of love. The narrative 
is full of strongly-drawn figures ; men who live in their emotions, no less than in their convictions and interests, and whose processes of thought 
are disclosed with a force and reality that constantly recall the masters of the novel." Mr. HAMILTON W. MABIE, in The Forum for April.

EDUCATED MEN IN THE FOREIGN 
SERVICE. 



The gravest of the charges brought against 
democracy declares it incapable of selecting 
suitable representatives for the performance of 
its public functions. This charge is no mere 
speculation, but rather an induction from suf- 
ficient experience to give it considerable weight. 
Our own experience of a century joins with the 
briefer but no less emphatic experience of the 
more democratic among the European com- 
munities in showing, or tending to show, that 
the rule of average opinion in a country results 
in putting the average man into public office, 
and that the average man is not often compe- 
tent to perform the delicate and highly spe- 
cialized work of administration. Even the 
Athenian democracy, at the time when its rep- 
resentatives were chosen by lot, was in better 
case than our more modern examples, for the 
average Athenian had a better training in the 
duties of citizenship than is got by the average 
Frenchman or American of to-day. If our 
modern democracy cannot solve the problem of 
making the common suffrage result in the se- 
lection of uncommon men for public office, its 
future is not promising, and its boastful pre- 
dictions will prove anything but justified. That 
the problem eventually will be solved, we firmly 
believe ; but the first step towards its solution 
must be taken by forcing the popular conscious- 
ness to a recognition of the fact that the prob- 
lem exists, by getting a healthful spirit of un- 
rest at work, instead of the complacent but 
deadly optimism that has come to be thought 
patriotic. 

Civil service reform is, of course, one of the 
agencies whereby thoughtful people expect to 
see brought about the performance of work for 
the public by persons selected upon a basis of 
fitness for the work to be performed. But 
what is at present practically understood by 
reform in the civil service is only the beginning 
of what must be accomplished before democracy 
can safely lay aside that problem to engage 
upon some of the others that will be certain to 
confront it. When we shall have found out 
how (or rather agreed, for we perfectly well 



'232 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



know how) to organize without any reference 
to politics the clerical forces of our municipal, 
state, and national governments, we shall still 
have to face the difficulty of getting the right 
men into the elective and higher appointive 
offices. If these are to remain what they now 
are, the stake of the professional politician and 
the sport of popular caprice, the cause of civil 
service reform, even if triumphant upon the 
lines now laid down by its devoted champions, 
will have won but a dubious and imperfect vic- 
tory. The stability of its triumph will, more- 
over, remain uncertain, constantly menaced by 
powerful adverse influences. 

It is because of these considerations that we 
welcome, as a step in the right direction, the 
bill for a reorganization of our diplomatic and 
consular service, just introduced into the United 
States Senate by Mr. Morgan. Our foreign 
service is not numerically important, but a 
great deal depends upon its efficiency, and it is 
peculiarly well fitted to serve as an object-lesson 
in administration. How completely demoral- 
ized it has been in the past, and still is, may 
be read in many a paper upon the subject (such, 
for example, as Mr. Wharton's recent review 
article), and illustrated from the recollections 
of every intelligent American who has kept an 
eye upon public affairs for a few years past. 
What it might become is well enough shown 
by a glance at the similar service of France, or 
England, or any other nation of the first class. 
Senator Morgan's bill proposes to take the for- 
eign service out of politics, and make of it a 
professional career that may be chosen by a 
young man just as he chooses law or divinity. 
It provides for a systematic classification of the 
diplomatic and consular posts, for entrance ex- 
aminations in foreign languages and such sub- 
jects as history and political science, for promo- 
tions based upon merit, and for fixity of tenure 
unless incumbents shall prove inefficient. Such 
an organization of our foreign service would 
certainly attract the best sort of men, for it 
would insure the proper qualifications, and 
would open as definite a career as is now of- 
fered by the military and naval services. The 
two highest grades of diplomatic appointments 
are not included within the proposed scheme, 
and it is not well that they should be at pres- 
ent. But twenty years from now, with such a 
reformed service in full operation for that pe- 
riod, there would be no good reason for going 
outside the ranks even for the selection of am- 
bassadors and ministers plenipotentiary. 

Such a plan as Senator Morgan contemplates 



has for many years been urged by all thought- 
ful persons having regard for our national dig- 
nity and honor. It is entirely practicable, for 
it is what every other important nation does as 
a matter of course, and what we ourselves do in 
the naval and military branches of our public 
service. We might criticise some of the details 
of the bill, such as the low scale of salaries pro- 
posed, the failure to recognize certain univer- 
sity degrees as evidence of fitness in lieu of 
examination, the proposition to examine exist- 
ing incumbents, and some aspects of the ma- 
chinery suggested for the work of reorganiza- 
tion and of examination. But the plan as a 
whole is so commendable, and its adoption would 
prove of such incalculable value to the nation, 
that we are not disposed to dwell upon minor 
objections. 

That almost anything would be better than 
the state of things existing in our foreign serv- 
ice is apparent to most serious people, and to 
all who have had occasion to observe the work- 
ings of that service in foreign countries. Our 
recent experiences with a South American re- 
public provided a humiliating object-lesson in 
the consequences of using diplomatic appoint- 
ments for the payment of political debts. Every 
American who has lived for any length of time 
in foreign capitals knows how we suffer as a 
nation from the frequent incompetency of our 
representatives. The American minister or 
consul and his queer doings furnish in almost 
every important European city the subject of 
a choice collection of anecdotes to which every 
newly arrived American colonist is called upon 
to listen with feelings of mingled amusement 
and shame. In some cities, the antics of a suc- 
cession of American representatives becomes 
fused into a sort of legendary epic, from which 
the type alone emerges, the individual being 
lost to sight. That he is not dear to the mem- 
ory of self-respecting Americans goes without 
saying. Of course, our haphazard system of 
pitchforking office-seekers into diplomatic and 
consular offices, with regard to neither their 
training, nor their culture, nor the peculiar re- 
quirements of the posts to which they are re- 
spectively assigned, sometimes results in a for- 
tunate selection. But in view of the whole 
measure of our offending, there is little conso- 
lation in the thought that we did contrive to 
send Taylor to Germany, Motley to Vienna, 
and Lowell to Madrid and the Court of St. 
James. And for the sake of having a body of 
thoroughly educated and cultivated gentlemen 
in our foreign service, of providing them with an

occupation that they might honorably select to 
follow as a life-calling, most of us would gladly 
consent to see even the highest posts filled by 
regular promotion from the ranks, and to re- 
nounce the privilege of occasionally honoring 
a distinguished man of letters by making him 
our officially accredited representative in some 
foreign capital. 



ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 

OF VIRGINIA* 
It has been pointed out by Professor March that 
the study of English in America may be traced to 
two men, Noah Webster and Thomas Jefferson. It 
is well known that as early as 1818 Mr. Jefferson 
included Anglo-Saxon " as a part of the circle of in- 
struction to be given to the students " of his pro- 
jected University. When the University of Vir- 
ginia was finally opened, in 1825, Anglo-Saxon was 
included in the courses offered, and from that day 
to the present it has always been given. But it was 
intrusted, along with some eight or ten modern lan- 
guages, to Dr. Blatterman, whose time must have 
been very fully occupied. After him, Dr. Kraitsir 
occupied the chair for two years ; and in 1844 Dr. 
M. Schele DeVere entered upon his distinguished 
career, which with the end of the present session 
rounds out its fifty years. It is computed that since 
the establishment of the University about seven 
hundred students have elected courses in Anglo- 
Saxon. But the influence of Jefferson was not lim- 
ited to the University of Virginia. Professor March, 
trained under the Websterian influence, but ac- 
quainted by residence in Virginia with the work of 
the University of Virginia, was called in 1857 to 
Lafayette College, where "English and Anglo- 
Saxon as a separate department of philological study 
coordinate with Latin and Greek " was first recog- 
nized. The influence that had previously led to the 
study of English at Lafayette was Jeffersonian. 
Professor March says : " Mr. Jefferson's plans for 
his University attracted attention through the whole 
country, and it was very likely on their suggestion 
that the founders of Lafayette College, which was 
chartered in 1826, made the study of Anglo-Saxon 
and English prominent in their proposed curricu- 
lum." 

There is a tradition how well-grounded it is 
impossible to say without further examination 
that the first distinctive course in English Litera-

ture ever offered in America was planned and car- 
ried out by three University of Virginia graduates, 
who were associated in the management of a school 
for young ladies. But the interest in the English 
language and literature, indicated by the import- 
ance attached to them by the founder of the Uni- 
versity and her sons, did not manifest itself in any 
very active development of their study. These sub- 
jects, at first assigned to the chairs of Modern Lan- 
guages and of Philosophy, and later grouped in part 
with History, were not recognized as a distinct de- 
partment until 1882, when Professor James M. Gar- 
nett was elected Professor of English Language and 
Literature. Ten years later, in 1892, the Board of 
Visitors created the Linden Kent Memorial School 
of English Literature. The establishment of this 
chair enables Professor Garnett to devote his entire 
time to English Language, while the new chair in- 
cludes Rhetoric and Belles Lettres besides English 
Literature. 

With the full freedom of election characteristic 
of this institution since its foundation, young men 
may pursue courses in either or both of these schools. 
In the School of the English Language, B. A., M.A., 
and Ph.D. courses are offered. A synopsis of these 
courses is herewith given: 

B.A. Course: Modern English. In this class, 
the study of the English drama and of the descrip- 
tive history of the language is pursued. Shake- 
speare is made a special subject of study. The 
critical study of one or two plays of Shakespeare, 
with private reading of about a fourth of the plays, 
is followed by similar study of selected works of 
other dramatic authors. Lectures on the history of 
the Elizabethan drama are given in connection with 
the study of Shakespeare. These treat the early 
dramatic forms prevalent in England, the rise of 
regular comedy and tragedy, the Pre-Shakespear- 
ian dramatists, the Shakespearian period, and the 
Post-Shakespearian dramatists to the close of the 
theatres in 1642. The study of the English drama 
occupies the first half-session ; that of the history 
of English treated from an elementary point of 
view, the second half-session. The course closes 
with the reading of some work in practical illustra- 
tion of the formation of English. The aim is to 
give such a knowledge of the history of the lan- 
guage as every educated man should possess. Three 
ectures a week are given. 

The object of the B.A. course is to treat specific 
jeriods of the language from both a philological and 
iterary point of view, stress being laid upon the 
r ormer ; and the Shakespearian period has been se- 
ected as that best suited to the beginner, and per- 
laps the most interesting. 

M. A. Course: Old and Middle English. In 
this class the historical and philological study of the 
anguage is pursued, the class beginning with its 
oldest forms, and tracing the language, by the 
study of specimens, through its different periods to 
he formation of modern English. After a thorough 



234

[April 16, 



study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and 
Middle English prose and poetry are read, with 
a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the 
origin and structure of English. Lectures on the 
position of English in the Indo-European family of 
languages, and on the history of the language, are 
also given. These treat in outline the other branches 
of the Indo-European family of languages, and in 
detail the Teutonic branch. Special stress is laid 
upon the development of the language during the 
Old and Middle English periods, and the infusion 
of the Romance elements which so greatly affected 
its character. The study of Old English (Anglo- 
Saxon) occupies the first half-session ; that of Mid- 
dle English the second half-session. In addition to 
what is read in class, assigned parallel reading of 
Old and Middle English works is also required. 
It is well for the student to have studied the his- 
tory of English as given in the class of Modern En- 
glish, or some similar course, before entering upon 
the study of the course in Old and Middle English, 
although this is not essential, as the two may be 
studied together. Some antecedent philological 
study is, however, necessary. The aim is to lay the 
foundation for more advanced studies in English 
Philology. There are three lectures a week. 

Ph.D. Course. In this course, to which the 
M. A. course is a necessary preparation, the method 
pursued is freer, and the taste of the individual stu- 
dent is consulted to a greater degree. The more 
advanced study of English Philology is the general 
subject ; and whether the students shall accomplish 
this by a more extensive reading of Old and Mid- 
dle English works, or by a study of Gothic as the 
basis for comparative study of the Teutonic lan- 
guages, is left to the student himself. In either 
case, encouragement to individual research is given 
by the requirements of a dissertation on some sub- 
ject cognate with the course pursued. In all classes 
the work is not limited to that assigned for class- 
preparation, but a course of parallel or private read- 
ing is prescribed, on which also the class is duly 
examined. 

In the Linden Kent Memorial School of English 
Literature, as in the School of the English Lan- 
guage, three courses are offered. 

B. A. Course. The class meets three hours a 
week throughout the session. For convenience of 
presentation, the course is divided as follows : 

1, Rhetoric. This comprises a careful study of 
the principles of style and of invention in prose dis- 
course, with exercise in essay-writing and in the crit- 
ical analysis of selected specimens of English prose. 

2, Versification. This course is based on the Pro- 
fessor's notes on Poetics. The lectures discuss the- 
ories and principles of versification, morphology of 
verse, history of verse forms, kinds of poetry, etc. 
Class exercises of various kinds are assigned from 
time to time. 

3, History of English Literature. This course 
comprises : (a) Lectures on the Development of 



English Literature prior to Chaucer ; (b) English 
Literature from Chaucer to Dryden ; (c) English 
Literature from Anne to Victoria. 

Besides general references published in the Cata- 
logue, numerous special references for authors, pe- 
riods, works, etc., are given throughout the course. 
In addition to the various written exercises of the 
class, five essays are required of each student ap- 
plying for graduation in the B. A. course. 

M. A. Course. In this course there are occa- 
sional lectures, but in general the exercises of the 
class are conducted by means of questions, conver- 
sations, and conference. Readings are assigned, 
independent investigations insisted upon, and writ- 
ten reports required from time to time. The stu- 
dents are encouraged to form their own judgments, 
and to express these orally and in writing. Refer- 
ences for each author or period studied are given, 
and the free use of the library in this and all courses 
is cordially recommended. There are four and a 
half hours a week. As an essential part of this 
course a dissertation showing independent and orig- 
inal work is required. 

Ph. D. Course. This course will be, in some 
measure, adapted to the needs of the students de- 
siring to pursue it. Its purposes will be to culti- 
vate more fully the love of letters, to encourage in- 
dependent and scholarly research, and to further 
the art of literary expression. It will include the 
study of some writer, or school of writers, or of 
some period or movement of literature, and will 
take into consideration the political, social, and lit- 
erary characteristics of the time under discussion. 

In conclusion it may be said that the relations 
existing here between students and professors is so 
cordial and frank that there is no lack of oppor- 
tunity for personal contact and conference. This 
enables the Professor of Rhetoric to supplement 
the written correction of essays and the general re- 
marks before the class by private conversation and 
individual advice. On the other hand, some of the 
best of these essays are published in the "Univer- 
sity of Virginia Magazine." This students' publica- 
tion and their weekly " College Topics " are appre- 
ciated adjuncts to the work in composition ; while 
the debating societies, in lieu of systematic training 
in oratory, give abundant opportunity for practice 
in speaking. 

The foundation for the library (now about 52,- 
000 volumes) was judiciously laid by the purchase 
of works of permanent and substantial value, and 
the wisdom which characterized the selection made 
by the first professors has in the main been exhib- 
ited by later literary committees. The library is 
stronger in English Literature prior to the nine- 
teenth century than it is in the products of this cen- 
tury or of our own country, but the deficiencies are 
fully recognized and the want is being supplied as 
fast as limited means allow.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE EARLY HOME OF THE ARYANS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your issue of March 16 contains a review of Clark's 
" Manual of Linguistics," under the heading of " Pop- 
ular Studies in Language," in which the following state- 
ment is made : " As regards the early home of the 
Aryans, our author wisely contents himself with stat- 
ing the various arguments in favor of a European and 
an Asiatic site, and leaves the choice to his readers. 
He seems to show, however, a leaning towards Schrader's 
selection of Eastern Iran." 

Knowing that Schrader abandoned the Asiatic theory 
a number of years ago (see his Sprachvergleichung und 
Urgeschichte, 1883), I was somewhat startled at the 
above statement, and upon examining Clark's work was 
surprised to find that the author not only showed no 
predilection for the Asiatic theory, but did not even rep- 
resent Schrader as favoring it. This the following ex- 
tracts from his book will show: 

" If it be right to locate, with Schrader, the original 
home in the district of the Middle Volga," etc. (P. xxix.) 

" The absence of common names for ass and camel 
does not suggest an Asiatic site for the original home." 
(P. liii.) 

" It falls now to utilize all that has been learnt regard- 
ing Aryan culture to assist in determining the scene of 
the joint-life. This used to be laid in Asia. The prim- 
itiveness of Sanskrit, the ancient civilization and tradi- 
tional antiqueness of the East, the reputation of Asia 
as the officina gentium, all tended to the allocation of an 
Asiatic site as the scene of the joint life. Primitiveness 
of language proves nothing as to primiti-ve home, and 
the presence of archaic traits in a language manifestly 
does not prove its speakers autochthonous in the dis- 
trict or zone." (P. Iviii.) 

Concerning Schrader's contention for a European ori- 
gin, Clark says: " Schrader's theory of the original home 
is plausible, well-reasoned out, and merits attention." 
After having given a brief account of it, he adds: "A 
good case is thus made out for the site tentatively 
chosen as the scene of the joint-life. The inductions 
that an examination of the language caused to be drawn 
are fairly well borne out by the objective realities of 
the steppe country of the Middle Volga." (P. Ixiii.) 
But the author goes on to say: "It seems to me that 
Hirt ('Die Urheimat der Indogermanen,' Brugmann's 
Journal, Vol. I., p. 464) has picked some holes in this 
theory. ... If this presentation of cognates is correct, 
the site chosen for the original home must be one where 
the four Indo-European trees (the birch, the willow, 
the pine, and the oak) grow together. Such a condi- 
tion throws out of count not only Asia, but Schrader's 
steppe country. The site must be European and wooded, 
and Hirt pitches on the country on the Baltic just out- 
side the N. E. corner of the beech zone." (P. Ixix.) 

Would it not seem from this that Clark rather has a 
" leaning towards " Hirt's selection of the Baltic country ? 

After having read Clark's book I was at first at a loss 
to account for Professor Dodge's slip, but I think the 
following sentence from Clark (p. Ixi.) will show what, 
in a hasty reading, has misled him : " The choice of 
Eastern Iran as the scene of the Indo-Iranian period 
of common culture has much to recommend it." Evi- 
dently he has read Indo-Iranian as being synonymous 
with Indo-European. 

Just a word more: Professor Dodge says that the 



author " wisely contents himself with stating the various 
arguments in favor of a European and an Asiatic site, 
and leaves the choice to his readers." Now, as a mat- 
ter of fact, Clark does not state the arguments in favor 
of an Asiatic site any more fully than is given in the 
extract from p. Iviii., and there only to pronounce against 
it. The time has come for repudiating the Asiatic the- 
ory. There is not one single indisputable argument to 
commend it. JULIUS E. OLSON. 

University of Wisconsin, April 5, 1894. 



Two jurists of the highest eminence, a great English 
orientalist, and a popular American novelist crowd the 
literary death-roll of the closing days of last month. 
Sir James Fitzjames Stephen (born in 1829) found time 
to do the work of a journalist for many years, contrib- 
uting, among other things, to " The Saturday Review " 
those remarkable historical papers that have recently 
been published in book form as "Horse Sabbaticse." 
He also wrote a profound treatise on " Liberty, Fra- 
ternity, and Equality," a " History of the Criminal Law 
of England," and " The Story of Naucomar," which lat- 
ter work showed the career of Warren Hastings in its 
true light, and relegated Macaulay's famous essay to 
the realm of fancy or of fable. George Ticknor Curtis 
(born in 1812) was the author of many legal works of 
standard value, as well as of biographies of James Bu- 
chanan and Daniel Webster, " John Charaxes, a Tale 
of the Civil War in America," and a " Constitutional 
History of the United States." William Robertson 
Smith (born in 1846) was of the first eminence as a 
student of Hebrew and Arabic. As the former, he pub- 
lished "The Old Testament in the Jewish Church," 
"The Prophets of Israel and their Place in History," 
"Lectures on the Religion of the Semites," and the 
Old Testament " article in the " Encyclopaedia Brit- 
annica," which brought him into bad odor with the or- 
thodox and into high esteem with scientific theologians. 
In Arabic, he succeeded the lamented Palmer at Cam- 
bridge, and occupied the chair of Arabic at the time of 
his death. Mrs. Jane G. Austin will be remembered 
as the author of a remarkable series of novels of early 
life in Massachusetts, "Standish of Standish" being 
perhaps the best of them, although many votes will be 
recorded for " A Nameless Nobleman." She depicted 
the Puritan life and character with both knowledge and 
sympathy, and endeared herself to all readers having 
New England blood in their veins. 

Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes is reported to have said 
in a recent conversation, apropos of his autobiography: 
" I work at the memoirs an hour or two each day, and 
am making satisfactory progress. That is, I have about 
one-half completed of all I shall write. Then I shall 
place the manuscript in the hands of my publishers, and 
they will keep it in their safe until I shall have passed 
away. My belief has always been that a man's memoirs 
should be distinctly posthumous, and I shall carry out 
that belief in my own case." 

Mr. Gladstone's Hawarden library, consisting of over 
twenty-four thousand volumes, having been placed in 
the iron building constructed for it, he has just issued 
a circular declaring it ready for the use of " students, 
lay and clerical, of any age, of inquirers, and of clergy 
or others desiring times of rest " ; and he does not de- 
sire the visits to it of mere sightseers. It is expected 
that students will reside in the hostelry adjoining.

IlEXRIK 



With respect to the fundamental classifica- 
tion of poets, the classification based upon the 
distinction between poetic form and poetic 
thought, between energy and beauty of expres- 
sion, Dr. Ibsen must be ranked with the in- 
ferior class, with the class of poets who aim 
to say things forcibly rather than to say them 
beautifully, with the Brownings rather than 
with the Tennysons. Like all the greater poets 
of this class, he offers abundant evidence of 
the ability to express himself in supremely ex- 
cellent form, but obviously does not care to 
make the effort except upon rare occasions. 
Nearly always his chief purpose is to say some- 
thing forcibly ; hence he uses prose or verse 
indifferently as the vehicle of expression. With 
what energy he is able to embody an idea, how 
provocative of thought and discussion is his di- 
rect and compact mode of speech, we have all 
seen in the little drama of "A Doll Home," and 
in the eager interest with which that compara- 
tively unimportant play was received a few years 
ago by our reading public. And it excited the 
same eager interest in the Scandinavian coun- 
tries when it first appeared. It is stated upon 
excellent authority that in Stockholm, the win- 
ter of the production of this piece, invitations 
to social gatherings often included a particular 
request that guests should abstain from dis- 
cussing " A Doll Home." How often we all 
wished that some such practice might obtain 
during the acute stages of the "Robert Els- 
mere " fever ! This incident shows very clearly 
how imperative is the demand made by Dr. 
Ibsen upon the attention of his readers. Far 
more, even, than the play mentioned do such 
works as " Brand " and " Peer Gynt," the 
poet's real masterpieces, rivet the attention and 
stimulate the thought. For their author is dis- 
tinctly a poet with a message. To borrow a 
phrase applied by Professor Royce to Hegel, 
and far more truly applicable to the subject of 
these remarks, he " is one of the most note- 
worthy of all the chosen instruments through 
which, in our times, the Spirit has spoken." 
Nearly all nineteenth century poetry has

Ibsen. Translated in the Original Metres, with an Introduc- 
tion and Notes, by C. H. Herford, Litt.D., M.A. New York :

been laden with some message. This is per- 
haps the chief characteristic of modern, as 
distinguished from earlier, poetry. Goethe's 
message was that the experience a man gets 
is the experience he needs, that we may find 
in our environment the means of the broad- 
est culture if we will but determine, once and 
for all, to do away with half-measures and all 
forms of incompleteness, and live with fixed 
resolve in the whole, the good, and the beauti- 
ful. Hugo's message was that of the Gospel 
repeated, of the brotherhood of man and the 
freedom of the soul. Shelley's message took 
the form of a dazzling dream of the future, 
held up for the comfort and the inspiration of 
men battling with the darkness and the folly 
of the present. Wordsworth's message was 
one of healing and consolation. Arnold shall 
tell us what it was : 

" He found us when the age had bound 
Our souls in its benumbing round ; 
He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears ; 
He laid us as we lay at birth 
On the cool flowery lap of earth, 
Smiles broke from us and we had ease ; 
The hills were round us, and the breeze 
Went o'er the sun-lit fields again ; 
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain. 
Our youth return'd ; for there was shed 
On spirits that had long been dead, 
Spirits dried up and closely furl'd, 
The freshness of the early world." 

It takes no Browning Club to discern what 
Browning's message was. We may find it any- 
where in his pages, and perhaps as well as any- 
where else in " Pippa Passes ": 

" God 's in his Heaven, 
All's right with the world." 

And Tennyson's message? That, too, seems 
clear enough. It is, if anywhere, in the sec- 
ond " Locksley Hall ": 

"Follow Light, and do the Right for man can half -control 

his doom 
Till you find the deathless Angel seated in the vacant tomb.'' 

Now, Dr. Ibsen's message may be described 
as an intensified form of Goethe's. The in- 
junction of both alike is to live wholly, to make 
life as complete as possible ; but Goethe lays 
more stress upon range, upon wideness and di- 
versity of interest. Dr. Ibsen, on the other 
hand, with all the emphasis at his command, 
enjoins an absolutely consistent and unflinch- 
ing persistence in some definitely chosen path 
of life. Both Goethe and Dr. Ibsen appeal to 
us to do away with incompleteness, with vacil- 
lation, with " halfness," to use the latter poet's 
favorite word ; but Goethe's meaning is that 
we should be broad and catholic in our view, 
while Dr. Ibsen's meaning is merely that we 
should follow out logically whatever course we

THE DIAL 



237 



have chosen. With him, the distinction be- 
tween good and bad is not half so important 
as the distinction between hesitancy and firm- 
ness, between the haphazard life and the life 
that has a purpose of some sort. 

" If pleasure's thrall 
Thou art, be that from year to year ; 
But be not that to-day, to-morrow, 
And then next year a prey to sorrow ; 
Be altogether what thou art, 
Be something wholly, not in part ! " 

We moderns bungle our lives so unspeakably 
because we are so ready to make concessions ; 
because we bow down to the spirit of compro- 
mise in order to get along comfortably with 
our fellow-men. What Dr. Ibsen says upon 
this point has no uncertain sound. Being a 
dramatist, his characters do not always give 
expression to his own opinions ; but we may be 
sure that Brand is speaking for the author when, 
after a vehement harangue addressed to the 
wavering multitude, he tells them that the Spirit 
of compromise is no other than Satan him- 
self. 

In other words, Dr. Ibsen stands for indi- 
vidualism first and last. A man's first duty to 
himself and to the world is to make sure that he 
is an individual ; not a thing of cross-purposes 
and wavering impulses, a caricature of human- 
ity. The modern State especially the mili- 
tary State with its paternalisms and its arti- 
ficial class distinctions, is the curse that rests 
upon individualism at present. Revolutions do 
not accomplish much, for they only substitute 
one form of machinery for another, and the in- 
dividual remains almost as trammelled as ever. 
The only revolution that ever amounted to any- 
thing, that was not hopelessly mismanaged from 
the start, was the Deluge ; and even that re- 
sulted in Noah's assumption of a dictatorship, 
affording a prototype for the action of the First 
Consul some thousands of years afterwards. 
Dr. Ibsen watched with much interest the de- 
velopments of the War of 1870 and the crea- 
tion of the new French Republic. Here at last 
seemed to be the opportunity for a new order 
of things. He wrote to a friend : 

"The old illusory France has gone to pieces; when 
the new actual Prussia likewise shall go to pieces, we 
shall advance with a leap into the coming age. Hej ! 
how ideas will tumble about us ! And it will be high 
time, in truth. For up to date we have been but living 
upon the crumbs from the revolutionary table of the 
last century, and that food has been long enough chewed 
and re-chewed. Our concepts call for new meanings 
and new explanations. Liberty, equality, and fraternity 
are no longer what they were in the days of the guillo- 
tine, of blessed memory. This is just what the politi- 
cians will not understand, and for that reason I hate 



them. Men still call for special revolutions for rev- 
olutions in politics, in externals. But all that sort of 
thing is trumpery. It is the human soul that must re- 
volt." 

But the Paris Commune came with its excesses; 
then the inevitable reaction, and the hopes thus 
expressed were rudely dashed to the earth. 

This plea for individualism, one of the strong- 
est that have ever been made, is chiefly embod- 
ied in two great dramatic poems, " Brand " 
and "Peer Gynt." Nothing could be more 
instructive than a detailed analysis of these two 
works ; but such an analysis would take us far 
beyond the limits of this brief paper. The 
barest outline must content us here. " Peer 
Gynt " is a semi-allegorical creation, suggestive, 
with its richness of incident and bewildering 
scene-shifting, with its variety of figures real 
and fanciful, of nothing so much as of the sec- 
ond part of Goethe's "Faust." Peer Gynt, 
like Faust, sees something of the lesser and 
the greater world, and works out a rude sort of 
salvation for himself ; although the certainty of 
any sort of salvation for him remains problem- 
atical enough at the end, for the drama closes 
with the menace of the melting-pot into which 
all souls that have frittered away their individ- 
uality are cast to be melted over for the sake 
of the raw material hanging over him, and 
the suggested possibility of redemption is, as 
with Faust, through the instrumentality of a 
woman's faith and unswerving devotion. For 
in Peer Gynt Dr. Ibsen has presented, with all 
the satirical energy at his command, what he 
conceives to be the essentially modern type of 
character : the soul that has stood for nothing 
positive, either good or bad, that has failed to 
assert its individual dignity, that has lived in 
dreams and in concessions, not in act and con- 
sistent purpose. 

In Brand, on the other hand, the poet pre- 
sents us with what is clearly his ideal type of 
character. He pictures him as a village priest, 
although he might just as well, for the purpose 
of the work, have pictured him as engaged in 
any other calling. But, since he is a priest, a 
priest he will be with all his heart and soul. 
" All or nothing " is the stern formula which 
sums up his creed, and in the light of which 
he shapes his own life. Thrown by chance or 
Providence into a little mountain village far to 
the north, he renounces the ambition that would 
impel him to seek a wider field for his activity, 
and devotes himself utterly to his mission. His 
mother lies at the point of death, but is un- 
regenerate, according to his strict interpreta-

tion of the divine behest ; he refuses to bear 
the consolations of religion to her bedside, and 
she dies in despair. His child falls a victim 
to the severity of the climate, but Brand will 
not forsake his mission for the chance of saving 
its life. Last of all, his dearly beloved wife 
pines away and dies in the struggle, strong in 
spirit but weak in the flesh. No amount of 
suffering can make him swerve one inch from 
the path of duty as he understands it. Yet 
he is not hard-hearted ; on the contrary, there 
is something quite ineffable in the depth and 
tenderness of his human feelings. But his call- 
ing demands absolute and unflinching devo- 
tion, and /shall have it as long as life endures. 
He cries in the hour of his anguish : 

" Be steadfast to the end, ray soul, 
All to renounce is victory's goal ; 
What we gain is ours never, 
What we lose we gain forever ! " 

And, contrasted with the splendid heroism, 
moral and physical, of his life, we have all the 
petty and provincial types of character that 
abound in such a village, and one by one they 
come under the lash of the poet's merciless 
satire. There is the sexton, the type of petty 
officialdom, who does not dare to exhibit ordi- 
nary human feeling 

" Not even he who would be can 
At once official be, and man." 

There is the bailiff, who has no conception of 
any higher life-purpose than that of perform- 
ing, with strict regard to rule, the functions of 
his office. And then there is the dean, Brand's 
ecclesiastical superior, who looks upon religion 
as a convenient instrument for the preservation 
of the social order, and upon the Church as 
being merely a part of the mechanism of the 
State. Against all these narrow theories and 
influences Brand pits himself, single-handed, 
and wages with magnificent energy and single- 
ness of purpose the hopeless fight. There are 
few more impressive things anywhere in litera- 
ture than the story of the words and acts of 
this man this type of what the poet conceives 
man could and might make himself, had he but 
the will to do so. To us, at least, this work 
has for nearly twenty years past been a source 
of consolation and inspiration. We have often 
recurred to it, and each time with a deepened 
sense of its almost matchless energy and eleva- 
tion. As a moral tonic, the work has few equals 
in literature. 

It is, then, with peculiar gratification that 
we welcome the English translation of "Brand" 
that has just been made by Professor Herford, 



and provided with notes and an elaborate in- 
troduction. The prose translation published 
by Mr. William Wilson two years ago, was, 
from the very fact of being in prose, hopelessly 
inadequate to embody the passionate energy of 
the original. Professor Herford's translation 
gives us both the substance and the form, and 
everyone acquainted with the original knows 
them to be inseparable. Moreover, he has re- 
produced the form with singular fidelity, al- 
though it is so difficult to put into English 
mould that we frankly admit having doubted 
the possibility of anyone doing at all what Pro- 
fessor Herford has now so triumphantly accom- 
plished. His version reads, for the most part, 
like an English poem, and many of its passages 
seem to us quite as strong and as beautiful as 
the original. We will not cavil about a few 
trifling defects here and there, when the work 
as a whole is deserving of such cordial com- 
mendation. To one slight matter, however, we 
must call a moment's attention. The two bits 
of macaronic verse that occur in the poem have 
been translated into plain English ; and we 
cannot but think that much of the intended ef- 
fect has thereby been lost. There is something 
too characteristic to be spared about Brand's 
last passionate cry : 

" Svar mig, Gud, i doden's slug ! 
Gselder ej et f relsens fnug 
Mandeviljens qvantum satis ? 

and the voice that calls from above, as the ava- 
lanche overwhelms him : 

" Han er deus caritatis ! " 
The ending is thus translated : 

BKAND. 

" God, I plunge into death's night, 
Shall they wholly miss thy Light 
Who unto man's utmost might 
Will'd ? 

A VOICE. 
" He is the God of Love." 

Since the translator has given us one macar- 
onic bit of his own devising 

" My worthy friend, I needs must hold 

His breeding scarcely quantum suff. 

For whom it is not great enough " 

he might have kept for us the Latin phrases 
that Dr. Ibsen saw fit to employ upon two crit- 
ical occasions. 

It only remains for us to exhibit the quality 
of Professor Herford's work by an extract or 
two. The satirical aspect of the poem appears 
to advantage in a conversation between Brand 
and the Bailiff (Fogden). The latter seeks to 
condone the degeneracy of his townsmen by 
recalling the fact that their ancestors made for 
themselves a name in history.

THE BAILIFF. 

" Now the land 's dwindled and decay'd, 
But our renown still lives in story. 
The days of our reputed glory 
Were when the great King Bele sway'd. 
Many a tale is still related 
About the brothers Wulf and Thor, 
And gallant fellows by the score, 
Went harrying to the British shore, 
And plunder'd till their heart was sated. 
The Southrons shriek'd with quivering lip, 

* Lord, help us from these fierce men's grip ' ; 
And these 'fierce men,' beyond all doubt, 
Had from OUR harbours sallied out. 
And how these rovers wreak'd their ire, 
And dealt out death with sword and fire ! 
Nay, legend names a lion-hearted 
Hero that took the cross ; in verity, 
It is not mentioned that he started 

BRAND. 

" He left behind a large posterity, 
This promise-maker ? 

THE BAILIFF. 

" Yes, indeed ; 
But how came you to ? 

BRAND. 
" O, I read 

His features clearly in the breed 
Of promise-heroes of to-day, 
Who take the cross in just his way." 

Satire gives way to indignant scorn, when, in 
the subsequent scene with the Doctor, Brand 
is told that to be humane is the first of the mod- 
ern commandments. 

" Humanity ! That sluggard phrase 
Is the world's watchword nowadays. 
With this each bungler hides the fad 
That he dare not and will not act ; 
With this each weakling masks the lie, 
That he '11 risk all for victory ; 
With this each dastard dares to cloak 
Vows faintly rued and lightly broke ; 
Your puny spirits will turn Man 
Himself Humanitarian ! 
Was God ' humane ' when Jesus died ? 
Had YOUR God then his counsel given, 
Christ at the cross for grace had cried 
And the Redemption signified 
A diplomatic note from Heaven ! " 

The height of passionate expression is reached 
in the last act, when Brand, spurned by the 
people whom he has sought to lead to a higher 
life, and driven out into the ice-bound moun- 
tain wilderness, reviews the past and forecasts 
the future in the magnificent soliloquy of which 
these are the closing verses (the particular his- 
torical reference being to Norway's virtual re- 
fusal to join with Denmark in repelling the 
Prussian and Austrian invasion of 1864) : 

" Direr visions, direr doom, 
Glare upon me through the gloom. 
Craft, the wolf, with howl and yell, 
Bays at Wisdom, sun of earth ; 
Cries of ruin ring to North, 
Calls to arms by fjord and fell ; 
And the pigmy, quaking, grim, 
Hisses : ' What is that to him ? ' 



Let the other nations glow, 
Let the mighty meet the foe, 
We can ill afford to bleed, 
We are weak, may fairly plead 
From a giants' war exemption, 
Need not offer All as meed 
For our fraction of Redemption. 
Not for us the cup He drank, 
Not for us the thorny wreath 
In His temples drove its teeth, 
Not for us the spear-shaft sank 
In the Side whose life was still. 
Not for us the burning thrill 
Of the nails that clove and tore. 
We, the weak, the least accounted, 
Battle-summons may ignore ! 
Not for us the Cross He mounted I 
Just the stirrup-slash's stain, 
Just the gash the cobbler scored 
In the shoulder of the Lord, 
Is our portion of His Pain ! " 

These extracts sufficiently illustrate the spirit 
and the manner of Professor Herford's trans- 
lation, and hardly less the spirit and the man- 
ner of the original poem. We may add that 
the translator's introduction is an admirable 
piece of thinking. This, for example, is a sin- 
gularly profound saying about Dr. Ibsen's 
work : " His most vehement teaching is apt to 
be coupled with the materials for criticising it. 
His most definite and dominant thoughts come 
to the surface laden with that tangle of counter- 
thought which gathers about every peremptory 
conclusion in the depths of a critical mind." 

Professor Boyesen's recent " Commentary 
on the Writings of Henrik Ibsen " consists of 
a lengthy introduction, followed by a dozen or 
more chapters upon as many separate plays. 
These chapters were originally written with lit- 
tle reference to one another, and published in 
THE DIAL and other periodicals. Taken sep- 
arately, they are interesting ; but taken as a 
whole, they do not make a very satisfactory 
book. There are many evidences of haste in 
the preparation of this " Commentary," and 
some of the verse translations interspersed are 
quite unworthy of the translator. Still, it is 
well that such a critical review of the whole of 
Dr. Ibsen's work should have been placed be- 
fore English readers, many of whom base a 
distorted notion of the Norwegian poet upon 
a few of the social dramas, these being, to one 
who knows his Ibsen, relatively unimportant. 
Occasionally Professor Boyesen says a notable 
thing, as when he remarks that in writing 
" Brand " and " Peer Gynt " the author polar- 
ized himself. And thoughtful readers of the 
great Norwegian will assent to our commenta- 
tor's closing words : 

" Though not always agreeing with Ibsen, I am greatly 
indebted to him for having kindled in my mind many

jects of vast concern which formerly I passed by with 
the Pharisee, and the Levite, and the rest of the re- 
spectable herd. He has the courage to look the ugli- 
est truths in the face without flinching, and to record 
what he sees and feels with a relentless disregard of

for babes; but to a mature mind it is wholesome and 
stimulating reading."

THEORIES CONCERNING ART.* 

The garden of art has been rather invaded, 
in these latter years, by the lovers of wisdom 
from the one side and by the lovers of man- 
kind from the other. The philanthropists have 
urged that the flowers be cut for baskets to 
send out to the hospitals, or else decocted into 
herb-teas for suffering humanity, or even that 
essences might be distilled from them for the 
making of panaceas. The philosophers, at first 
content with mingling reminiscences of the gar- 
den with their other dreams, have now conde- 
scended to more particular acts of usefulness. 
Some of them analyze the flowers after the 
most rigid botanical methods; others devise 
the most scientific means for improving their 
growth ; and others, finding the garden agreea- 
ble to such as happen past, explain to those for- 
tunates why such should be the case. As to 
the gardeners, they view this irruption in vari- 
ous ways. Some of them retire to their own 
private arbors, where they either forget the 
strangers entirely, or else (sometimes) call 
out injurious names at them or make faces. 
Others, however, are a good deal fascinated by 
the philanthropists, and busy themselves with 
the hospital baskets and the herb-teas. And 
others still take council with the scientists, and 
by means of their phosphates and nitrates pro- 
duce new blossoms of very strange loveliness. 
Meanwhile the world travels by on the high- 
way outside, enjoys the flowers to some extent, 
but does not allow itself to become painfully 
excited at what is going on within. 

At bottom there is good reason for all this. 
Ethics and science certainly have something 
to say here. A man cannot well make him- 
self independent of duty or of facts by being 
an artist. So, on the whole, good will come 
of the matter in some way or other. 

* ART IN THEORY. By George Lansing Raymond. New 
York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

PAIN, PLEASURE, AND ^ESTHETICS. By Henry Rutgers 
Marshall. New York : Macmillan & Co. 

LA SUGGESTION DANS L' ART. Par Paul Sonrian. Paris: 
Alcan. 



Leaving ethics on one side, as far as the 
present article is concerned, there are several 
books among the recent publications which are 
interesting from the scientific point of view. 
Just at present the scientific sesthetician is very 
scientific indeed. In fact, it is often quite im- 
possible for the average unscientific reader to 
understand a word of what he is saying. One 
is inclined at first to resent this difficulty, as 
Macaulay resented his inability to understand 
Kant : it may be that the reason is the same. 
Whether this be or no, Mr. Marshall, in his 
treatise on "Pain, Pleasure, and ^Esthetics," 
realizes the situation and provides against any 
such protest. His book is, first and foremost, 
# treatise in Psychology ; but, as he himself 
remarks, he hopes to interest the artist and the 
general reader. For these last, therefore, he 
has resumed the sum of each chapter in lan- 
guage that they can understand. Elsewhere 
he feels free to be technical ; but even here 
" the average reader " can sometimes follow 
him, although it must be confessed that he will 
often find himself beyond his depth. Mr. 
Marshall's book is a special treatise, and M. 
Souriau's " La Suggestion dans 1'Art " is an- 
other. But the latter, perhaps because the au- 
thor is a Frenchman, is not only expressed in 
terms comprehensible to the majority, but is 
written in a very agreeable manner. It is based 
on a theory quite fascinating in itself, and 
worked out into a very interesting presentation. 

More general in scope than either of these 
is " Art in Theory," by Professor G. L. Ray- 
mond. In this book the author's previous 
works are seen to have their place in a definite 
system, the general plan of which is now for 
the first time, I believe, made- public. This 
particular book, the third in publishing, would 
be the introductory volume. Next would come 
" The Genesis of Art-Form," which appeared 
last year ; a volume on " Rhythm, Proportion, 
and Harmony in Art " is promised ; and lastly, 
I should suppose, are special treatises on the 
various arts, of which that on Poetry was pub- 
lished some time since. But whatever be the 
order in which Professor Raymond arranges 
his work in his mind, he has done enough al- 
ready to show that he intends a systematic view 
of Art, both in its general characteristics and 
in particular. Of such a view "Art in Theory " 
supplies the standpoint. It is, in general, on 
the nature of the fine arts (including, of course, 
music and poetry), considering also, of neces- 
sity, the theory of beauty and the relation of 
the arts among themselves.

THE DIAL 



241 



Perhaps the first thing to be said of this book 
is that in general structure it is an exceedingly 
nice piece of argument and exposition. One 
may differ on particular points, one may even 
hold that the logic is not always severe, but I 
think every careful reader must be delighted at 
a handling of the subject at once so harmonious 
and symmetrical as well as natural. It is not the 
easiest of reading, naturally enough ; but there 
is a pleasure in considering the general plan of 
what one has read when it appears in a form 
which one may almost call artistic in itself. 

The basis of Professor Raymond's work is 
the idea that so long as we consider art as the 
mere representation of the forms of nature or 
as the mere expression of the conceptions of 
the mind, we take a view that is wrong, not 
only because it is partial but also because it is 
indiscriminating. And even if we recognize 
both elements, so long as we recognize them 
as independent we fail of a full understand- 
ing. The representation of nature in the arts 
involves the ideas of the mind, and the expres- 
sion through the arts of mental conceptions 
demands the forms of nature. The two are in- 
terdependent. On this basis is worked out a de- 
termination of the Higher Representative Arts. 
Here the subject divides. On the side of the 
forms of nature, we come to a consideration of 
beauty, and reach a definition involving a rec- 
ognition not only of nature but of the mind. 
On the other hand, in a study of the modes of 
representation as affected by the conditions of 
the mind we are led through a discussion of the 
characteristics of the different arts and their 
relations to each other. Here the treatment 
terminates as far as this particular book is con- 
cerned, but the two lines of study are continued 
in the other volumes of the series. 

One will hardly be expected, in an article like 
the present, to offer special criticisms. It must 
be enough if one can give a general notion of 
the purport of a book and indicate its relation to 
other lines of thought. Professor Raymond's 
work has one value which some systems of a3s- 
thetics by no means possess : that of laying out 
the ground in such a way that one can readily 
find a local habitation for such other notions as 
one may have on hand. This is an excellent 
thing ; until one has such a basis it is difficult to 
feel that one has any consistent ideas at all. It 
will be useful, therefore, to show what relation 
to Professor Raymond's theory is borne by the 
studies already mentioned of M. Souriau and 
Mr. Marshall. 

When Professor Raymond reaches the conclu- 



sion that the Fine Arts are arts which (among 
other things) represent the effects of nature 
upon the mind, he uses a phrase which, although 
necessary to his line of thought, rather veils 
an interesting branch of inquiry. If we said, 
rather, that art was the presentation of that 
which will cause in the mind of another the ef- 
fects which have been caused in the mind of 
the artist, we should at once see that it was of 
importance to know what it was that was pre- 
sented and how it caused its effects. This, re- 
marks Professor Raymond in a later part of 
his book, is the subject of other volumes of the 
series. It is also the subject of M. Souriau's 
book a book extremely interesting, compre- 
hensive, and entertaining. How do works of 
art induce in our mind the ideas which nature 
has called up in the mind of the artist ? For 
one thing, M. Souriau propounds a curious 
theory. The mental state caused by a work of 
art, he argues, is physiologically akin to the 
state of hypnosis : a state in which the imag- 
ination works powerfully while the will is re- 
duced. Hence, however art creates its effects, 
the matter is rendered more easy by the phy- 
siological condition of whomever is affected. 
But this idea, although it is wrought out in 
some detail in the book, is not necessary to the 
main theme, which is an inquiry into the means 
whereby the artist suggests (to use the word 
in the technical sense) to another mind such 
things as he desires. And here developes a 
most interesting study of the methods and ef- 
fects of the arts, which, unfortunately, can be 
followed no farther just here. 

M. Souriau's book, then, covers a field that 
is not treated in the present work of Professor 
Raymond. Mr. Marshall, on the other hand, 
studies some matters which Professor Raymond 
has treated very differently. " Pain, Pleasure, 
and Esthetics " is a special work in Psychol- 
ogy ; its general purport has for some time 
been known through the author's articles in 
" Mind." It will therefore call for no elab- 
orate notice here ; an indication of its drift will 
be enough for our purpose. Here we have a 
new theory of art, of beauty ; a theory which 
differs from Professor Raymond's in that it 
arises from a consideration of the causes of 
art and its effects, while Professor Raymond 
considers chiefly its character and conditions. 
Not that either view excludes the other ; in- 
deed, the theories may be compared. Accord- 
ing to Mr. Marshall, the impulse to art is an 
instinct that leads us to wish to attract others 
to ourselves, and beauty is that which causes 



242 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



in us pleasure which exists not only in the mo- 
ment but in revival. According to Professor 
Raymond, the impulse to art is an instinct that 
leads us to exercise our faculties in ways not 
needful to our existence (the so-called " play 
impulse "), and good art is that which gives us 
in a great degree apprehensible unity of varied 
effects upon the sensation or the imagination 
or upon both. Without going into details, it 
is not hard to see that where the two theories 
come into contact there is a clash (Marshall, 
pages 103-5, 332-3). Of the two, in spite 
of the value of Professor Raymond's basis, 
Mr. Marshall's is by far the stronger, and it 
is probable that when fully apprehended and 
applied it will prove the more vital and preg- 
nant. At present, however, it stands in great 
need of an interpreter before the public ; not 
on account of its technical expression only, but 
because its very ideas, both in premise and con- 
clusion, are such as can be fully appropriated 
by the psychologist alone. 

Interesting as the study of such books is, 
one is led in reading them to ask, What is the 
use of it all ? They are as a rule pretty hard 
reading, and it hardly seems as if an increased 
knowledge concerning the nature of art resulted 
in any increase in our enjoyment of art itself. 
Mr. Pater remarks that " the value of such at- 
tempts has most often been in the suggestive 
and penetrating things said by the way." If 
such were certainly the case, it would be a great 
saving of time if someone would go through 
the great tract of aesthetic writing in order to 
pick out the suggestive and penetrating things 
and make a little book of them. But it may 
be that such is not the only value. The intel- 
lectual exercise we may set aside, for the phil- 
osophy of art as philosophy gives no more 
pleasure and no less than other branches of 
the science. The question may be, rather, Is 
our power of artistic enjoyment made greater, 
more vigorous, by such reading ? There are 
certainly not a few who would say that the case 
was quite the reverse, that our power of artis- 
tic enjoyment was crowded to the wall and 
smothered by the force of scientific inquiry. 
To the point is the remark of Sir Joshua, who 
once said that a reason which lessened his af- 
fection for the study of criticism was that crit- 
ics, so he had observed, "debar themselves 
from receiving any pleasure from the polite 
arts, at the same time that they profess to love 
and admire them." I do not think he is right 
about all critics, but there is certainly some- 
thing in his view. 



Whether one gains greater artistic pleasure 
or not may be doubtful. What is not doubt- 
ful is that, whatever may be our artistic pleas- 
ure, we all love to talk about art. Rightly or 
wrongly, people cannot be restrained from talk- 
ing about it. And such being the case, it is, 
on the whole, a thing greatly to be desired ( if 
people are to be still allowed to talk to others 
on the subject or to write about it ) that they 
should talk or write sense instead of nonsense, 
which end may possibly be attained by the dif- 
fusion of a more accurate knowledge of the na- 
ture of beauty and of the conditions under which 
only the arts can be rightly pursued and en- 
joyed. In other words, we all tend to think 
about those things which delight us, and hence 
every real step toward clearer and surer thought 
on such matters is of some general interest.

by Mr. John M. Bonham. The author is earnest, 
thoughtful, and means to be candid; he has also a 
real contention : yet his oversight of the world the 
entire world to which we belong is so narrow that 
he has added one more book of dogma to the many 
books of dogma which he was striving to thrust aside. 
He understands by secularism, knowledge of the 
physical world which finds its most accurate expres- 
sion in physical science ; and he regards this knowl- 
edge, with the feelings and methods connected with 
it, as silently taking possession of the human mind 
to the ultimate exclusion of all other forms of thought. 
He accepts this tendency as both inevitable and de- 
sirable. " The hope of the theologian to make any 
final adaptation of theology which shall enable the- 
ology to remain permanently in such adaptation, 
must therefore be illusive " (p. 48 ). " The whole 
movement of her law determines that there is one 
path, and only one, which marks the course from 
ignorance to the highest attainable knowledge, and 
that this path lies in the line of the ultimate subjec- 
tion of all ideals to the tests of progressive knowl- 
edge " (p. 375). Is it not a little strange that one 
who believes that all labor devoted to theology and 
metaphysics is futile, that there is but one form of 
real knowledge that known as science, should add 
to these worthless discussions a volume of four hun- 
dred pages, containing hardly a trace of science, and 
resting exclusively on a philosophical basis ? This 
incongruity of method is hidden from the author by 
the superficial fact that his conclusions are negative 
in form. He is forgetful of the fact that it requires 
essentially the same knowledge to deny as to affirm, 
and that his entire method of reasoning, from be- 
ginning to end, is at one with that which he would 
reject as infinitely variable and wholly uncertain in 
its issue. The dogmatism of theology has often 
been battered ; he batters it once again, but seems 
utterly oblivious of the large candor which has taken 
its place in many minds. He has evidently felt the 
powerful drift of secularism, the force and value 
of which, in its own limits, we fully admit, but 
hardly at all the strength of those deeper under-cur- 
rents which are restoring the balance of our lives. 
He personifies theology, metaphysics, nature, sci- 
ence, in so positive a form that they seem to become 
malign and benign spirits in the world, having their 
way with it for good or for evil. He forgets that 
it is man alone, and precisely the same man, who 
has busied himself respectively with theology and 
science ; and that if man has made of theology that 
complete mess the author supposes him to have 
made, it would be a most unexpected result to find 
him wholly and finally right in his second inquiry. 
Here is a single leap from darkness into absolute 
light. There is a class of physicists who do not 
understand their own doctrine of evolution in its 
bearing on spiritual life ; and I know no better 
proof of the general validity of the spiritual move- 
ment among men than the way in which it con- 
stantly extends and renews itself. 

The volume entitled " Religion " is written with 



a very different estimate of faith from that which 
pervades " Secularism." " It is religion, rather than 
the aptitude to invent tools, that has created civili- 
zation " (p. 29). "If religion shows itself too 
obstinate in maintaining its traditions and pre- 
scriptions, science, in its turn, shows itself too 
eager to impose theories whose truth it has not- as 
yet verified, and practices whose morality is as yet 
doubtful" (p. 188). The author looks upon re- 
ligion as a permanent school of human thought, a 
most pervasive and powerful incentive in conduct, 
and one, in common with all other natural tenden- 
cies, slowly purifying and perfecting itself as civil- 
ization progresses. The discussion is clear, concise, 
and cool to the point of frigidity. It expresses the 
conclusion of one who looks upon religious evolu- 
tion in the world from the outside, but is not dis- 
posed to underrate the importance of the phenom- 
ena involved in it. It does not identify religion 
with any one faith, but treats in a critical way the 
successive phases through which it has passed, and 
the successive difficulties it has encountered. The 
discussion leads up to one conclusion the separa- 
tion of religion from the State as a necessary con- 
dition of its own liberty and highest development. 
The aloofness of the author makes the work the 
more effective in enforcing this one purpose the 
ultimate independence and freedom of religious life. 
It is a book that is local in its atmosphere, in the 
sense that it is fitted to enforce on Frenchmen the 
respect which is due to religious evolution, and the 
free form it is destined ultimately to assume. 

Dr. Sanday's lectures on " Inspiration " are com- 
prehensive and liberal. The author deals with the 
history and construction of the canon of the Old 
and of the New Testament with reference to a more 
definite and admissible doctrine of inspiration. He 
accepts, in a conservative way, the results of crit- 
icism as expressed in the works of Kuenen and 
Wellhausen. He thinks, however, that this criti- 
cism is pushed too exclusively in the interest of 
naturalism, and is not sufficiently free in recogniz- 
ing the divine element in the sacred history. Inspi- 
ration, in the author's view, finds its typical highest 
expression in the words of the prophets, and from 
this point shades down in various parts of the 
canon till it quite disappears. " How do we know 
that they are not projecting their own thoughts out- 
side themselves, and ascribing them to an external 
cause ? This is the heart of the matter. And the 
one point on which we must firmly take our stand 
is the belief that in this contention of theirs the 
prophets were not mistaken, that their utterances 
had a cause outside themselves, a real objective 
cause, not to be confused with any mental process 
of their own " (pp. 145, 146). The theory of the 
author would seem more consistent if he were con- 
tent to yield this objective source of inspiration and 
accepted the fact of inspiration on the personal side, 
with whatever limitations this may impose. The 
objective fact, whatever it may be, is very obscure, 
very troublesome, and very much out of harmony

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



with a truly spiritual method. The mind itself is 
the only medium of truth. Truth and the Spirit 
of Truth must finally work in and by it ; and we 
gain nothing by delaying the process. The object- 
ive declaration must submit itself at once, in its 
spiritual uses, to the mind that receives it. The 
spirit alone is the vehicle of truth ; it alone is ca- 
pable of a true inspiration, an elevation into the re- 
gion of spiritual light. God works under his own 
laws, according to his own methods, in quickening 
the thoughts of men ; and this process loses charac- 
ter rather than gains it by any objective constrain- 
ing cause whatever. Truth is not truth, nor inspi- 
ration inspiration, till the mind, by its own powers 
in its own right, grasps the revelation. We gain 
nothing whatsoever by delaying this consummation. 
The prophet is prophetic by virtue of his superior 
insight. The inspiration which blesses us is the in- 
spiration of Christ, which enabled him to lift the 
familiar texts of Scripture into a new meaning, and 
run his lines of exposition parallel, indeed, with fa- 
miliar ideas, but on a much higher level. The au- 
thor might the more readily make this concession, as 
he regards the Messianic prophesies not as historic 
foresights, but rather as spiritual insights, a fore- 
shadowing of the things sure to be contained in the 
providence of God. Whatever trouble the super- 
natural may give us elsewhere, it ought not to give 
us trouble in inspiration, since the natural is here 
the best possible vehicle of the supernatural. The 
truth can declare itself no otherwise than by its own 
medium, the human mind. 

The volume entitled " Speculum Sacerdotum " 
contains a series of addresses intended to present 
the true function and temper of the minister of 
Christ. The author is guided chiefly by St. Paul ; 
and under such titles as " Self-Denial," " Purity," 
" Long-Suffering," " Reputation," "Self-Surrender," 
he defines on various sides the spirit of service in 
holy things. The temper of the work is conven- 
tional, very devout, and fairly penetrative. The 
conventionalism of the book is real, though decis- 
ively of the better order. It is in a distinctively 
religious method, though in a broad way, that the 
author would render his word and work. The 
preacher is not to bring social and political truth, 
but divine truth to his hearers. The region has not 
been attained in which the two are inseparable. 
Sacred things are still to be spoken as sacred things, 
and secular things as secular. In this method, 
neither is well spoken. We must, like our Lord, 
have the parables of life on our lips, before we can 
either deeply see divine things, or adequately ex- 
pound them, or correct the world by them. 

The volume of Hulsean Lectures, by Dr. Hort, 
is one of genuine insight. The passage, "I am the 
way and the truth and the life," must return fre- 
quently to every spiritual mind as a most compre- 
hensive summation of the Gospel. Indeed, to me 
it seems a declaration so explicit, to put our faith 
so thoroughly and so exclusively within the range 



of an interior personal life, as to exclude all the for- 
mal doctrinal renderings of the words of Christ. 
He is the way and the life because he is the truth. 
He, in his thought, character, and action, becomes 
such a disclosure of the spiritual world that he is 
henceforth and forever a guide in it ; he deepens 
and widens all our experiences of it. Dr. Hort 
conceives very fully and tenderly the circumstances 
under which the words were called out ; th* sense 
of hopeless loss and confusion that was overtaking 
the disciples, as Christ, in bodily presence, seemed 
ready to slip away from them, leaving no sufficient 
clue, either to their thought or their action, by 
which they could follow him. Thomas, with dis- 
turbed and narrow vision, exclaims, '' We know 
not whither thou goest ; how then can we know the 
way ? " To lift the disciples off from a semi-sen- 
suous life into a purely spiritual one, was what 
Christ assayed to do in the words, " I am the way, 
the truth, and the life." His departure demanded 
the transition ; and the transition was secured by 
his departure. The spirit of this comprehensive 
text is rendered with great fulness, and often with 
much depth. The only criticism we make upon the 
book is that at times the connections of thought be- 
come thin and slight, and do not fully sustain the 
general force of the exposition. This may arise 
from the fact that the contents of the volume were 
first given as lectures. 

Something of the same difficulty appears in the 
next volume, " Natural Theology," also delivered 
on a lecture foundation. The lecturer spins his 
thread thin, a little according to his exigencies. One 
cannot now write profitably on Natural Theology 
without a truly scientific temper ; a thorough appre- 
hension of how the world has come together, part 
with part; and without also being quite free from 
a disposition to fall back readily on the supernatural. 
Professor Stokes, being thoroughly versed in physics, 
meets well the first requisite, and fairly well the 
second requisite. There are two tendencies that 
are barren, though not equally barren, in discussing 
physical things in their spiritual bearings: a dis- 
position to be satisfied with a mechanical explana- 
tion of them, leaving out of sight all the inner mys- 
tery of construction. The mind darts about, like 
a water-fly, just dimpling the surface of things, dis- 
turbing nothing and disturbed by nothing beneath. 
This tendency Professor Stokes wholly escapes, and 
is an earnest theist because of his deep sense of the 
ultimates our explanations are constantly reaching. 
The second impediment to any adequate growth of 
thought is an easy solution of all dependences by 
referring them at once to the will of God. I can- 
not feel that the author has come quite as fully into 
the light in dealing with the supernatural as in deal- 
ing with the natural. The two seem to remain some- 
what in collision with him, as they still do with 
most minds. A reconciliation of the natural and 
supernatural in one coherent system of thought is 
a very urgent demand. It is not unlike that by 



1894.]

which we unite in man causal and free dependences. 
The universe can no more have spiritual life with- 
out that immediate presence of the Divine Spirit 
which is shadowed forth by the supernatural, than 
the brain of man can be the seat of the soul of man, 
obeying no causes except physical ones. Professor 
Stokes thinks there is a different force of proof in 
the pleasing marking of flowers and birds from that 
found in the colors of the rainbow. That is, phy- 
sical law in its apparent necessity and permanence 
yields less proof, at least less impressive proof, than 
physical law in connections not involved in the en- 
tire system of things. The immanence of the mind 
of God the supernatural at the centre of the nat- 
ural seems to be overlooked by this opinion. The 
book, especially in its treatment of physico-spiritual 
questions, is one of insight and feeling. 

The volume by the Rev. Wilfrid Ward is made 
up of essays, published in English reviews. Though 
not formally united, they are united in their gen- 
eral drift. They are very able and interesting. 
This volume, like previous works by the same au- 
thor, has been called out by his intimate connection 
with the Catholic revival known as the "Oxford 
Movement." He aims to show, and does show, the 
extreme overruling force which a sceptical or ag- 
nostic movement for the moment acquires, leading 
to the oversight of truths and tendencies equally 
permanent and more powerful than those with which 
it itself is dealing. There is no disparagement of 
the critical temper, there is simply an assertion 
of the under counter-current that is deeper and no 
less inevitable. The work is well-fitted to awaken 
a more catholic temper by imparting a broader and 
more appreciative one. Its closing essay, "The 
Wish to Believe," is the longest one, and enters 
fully into those conflicting feelings which mingle 
with our beliefs and unbeliefs, inclining us to ac- 
cept or reject conclusions even in the very act and 
attitude of asserting the power of pure reason. In- 
deed, outside of mathematics there is no pure rea- 
son. Reason, as it deals with the facts of being, 
dissolves at once into feeling, as certainly as light 
breaks into color when it falls upon this changeable 
world of ours. As color brings additional disclos- 
ure, so do feelings help to give us the very terms 
in life with which we are dealing. Half our errors 
come from the want of those truly empirical data 
which are due to the emotions. This volume touches 
deeply, interestingly, and instructively that true spir- 
itual equilibrium that arises from both partaking of 
the spiritual world and thinking about it. It is a very 
admirable and instructive work, and cuts deeply 
into a great deal that is self-confident yet superficial 
in human thought. It puts a true logic of life over 
against the formal logic with which it is often con- 
fronted and apparently overthrown. 

The trial of Professor Briggs before the General 
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church proved less 
significant, less of a landmark in our progress to- 
ward liberal faith, than it gave promise of being. 



When it was first foreshadowed it seemed about to 
become one more sharp contention for religious lib- 
erty. It turned out rather a muddle, in which men, 
like disturbed bees, confusedly sought their enemy 
and inflicted their wounds at random. The some- 
what voluminous account of the trial, now before us, 
is written with perfect candor by one in full sym- 
pathy with Presbyterian belief, who is prompted to 
his task by the feeling that Professor Briggs in no 
material way departed from that faith. He is 
convinced that the Assembly misapprehended the 
grounds of contention and fell into an act of injus- 
tice. This conclusion is carefully, quietly, and thor- 
oughly presented. In tracing the history of the 
trial, we draw attention simply to the first charge, 
as indicating the kind of confusion which charac- 
terized it. This charge rested chiefly on the words 
in the inaugural of Professor Briggs. " There are 
historically three great fountains of divine author- 
ity, the Bible, the Church, and the Reason." Most 
men, inclined to accept liberal beliefs, looked upon 
this affirmation, when it was made, as a clear and 
earnest assertion of relatively independent lines of 
revelation in the minds of men, in human history 
and in the Scriptures. It was this conviction that 
aroused interest everywhere in the action of the 
Presbyterian Church toward so salient and suggest- 
ive a position. It is not strange that that church 
looked on the declaration taken in connection with 
the universal movement toward liberality as break- 
ing with the authority of the creed, and was dis- 
turbed by it. The only surprising thing is that this 
adverse prepossession was so strong ; that the As- 
sembly gave no weight to the words of Professor 
Briggs discarding explicitly and repeatedly the or- 
dinary interpretation, and putting in its place a 
rendering of the assertion to which the most rigid 
doctrinaire could hardly object without self-stulti- 
fication. The natural conclusion of the trial would 
seem to have been, " How great a matter a little 
fire kindleth." Events, however, did not take this 
turn. The Assembly was disposed to force on Pro- 
fessor Briggs's incautious expression the obnoxious 
meaning first attached to it ; and thus the trial 
added to its mediaeval character a touch of the 
ludicrous. The Assembly was in haste for the 
auto-ddrfe, and was not to be balked by any state of 
mind or change of mind on the part of its victim. 
It was in vain that Professor Briggs denied that 
he intended to assert any independence in these 
three sources of truth ; in vain that he affirmed the 
dependence of each and all of them on the spirit of 
God ; and in vain that he affirmed infallibility as 
attaching to the Scriptures alone. Instead, there- 
fore, of a stimulating contention for higher forms 
of truth, we have, in the trial of Professor Briggs, 
a peculiarly perverse presentation of the narrowness 
of the human mind. 

There has been, perhaps, no event on this con- 
tinent in the religious world so simple, so spectacu- 
lar, and so significant as the Parliament of Relig- 



246 



THE DIAL

ions. It was not a more thorough disclosure of 
facts nor a sharper enunciation of principles that 
made it remarkable ; but rather the direct address 
to the eye, ear, and heart, due to the spectacle of 
men from all parts of the world, and with great va- 
riety of faith, in warm and respectful conference 
with each other on the same platform before an en- 
thusiastic audience. This is a fact reached by many 
years of preparation, and one which will define a 
point for many subsequent years of fulfilment. The 
more conservative minds those who in cool relig- 
ious decorum held back from participation, or were 
not willing by implication to weaken the infallibil- 
ity of their own faith cannot fail to feel the gen- 
tle sympathetic stir of thought which has gone forth 
from that assembly to the very corners of the earth. 
The religious world is altered by it. Its hostilities 
are softened ; its spiritual penetration and power 
are enlarged. The call for a muster of the forces 
of faith, one and all, has been heard through all the 
land. 

Two works, now before us, spread out fully this 
great event, and preserve, as far as possible, by a 
detailed report and by many illustrations from far 
and near, its sensuous power. The same marvel- 
lous executive ability that was everywhere present 
in the Columbian Exposition was also present in 
full measure in the Parliament of Religions. Dr. 
John Henry Barrows, the efficient Chairman of its 
Executive Committee, has summed up and finished, 
in two affluent volumes, his great labor in devising 
and securing this assembly. 

The review by the Rev. L. P. Mercer necessarily 
suffers somewhat in the presence of the larger work. 
It has, however, a distinct purpose, and may meet 
the wants of many. It aims, by a careful analysis 
of the subjects involved in the speeches and papers 
presented, and by offering only those portions of 
them which bore most directly on these topics, to 
put in a brief, manageable compass the thought and 
intellectual force of this grand occasion. Those who 
are confused and wearied by the miscellaneous and 
multitudinous character of the complete event may 
be glad to sample it in this book. Those who wish 
the feast entire will prefer the larger volumes, even 
though they burden the table with 1600 compact 
pages. 

A book that has grown immediately out of the 
Parliament of Religions is " Heart Beats," by P. C. 
Mozoomdar. It opens with a brief but very in- 
teresting biographical sketch of its distinguished 
author. It is in all respects a spiritual gem. Mr. 
Samuel J. Barrows says of it, at the close of the 
biography, " To me it seems the most remarkable 
devotional book since that of Thomas & Kempis." 
The work is made up of brief detached spiritual 
experiences, carefully treasured as they have oc- 
curred in the life of the author. They denote a 
keen, incisive intellect, strong and delicate spiritual 
sensibilities, and a practical, proportionate bent of 
mind. They are widely theistic. They escape the 



warping force of dogma, and the perverting power 
of asceticism. They are the wholesome experiences 
of a healthy spirit, and yet of one that has the vis- 
ion and impulse of the prophet. They contrast 
very favorably with the carefully reproduced devo- 
tions of the good Bishop Hall. 

Another volume by Mr. Mozoomdar, entitled "The 
Spirit of God," gives expression to such a rhapsody 
of spiritual life that one needs to take it a little at 
a time, in an elevated mood. The soul is simply 
rising and riding, like a wide-winged bird on a 
strong wind. The immanent mind of God is most 
fully and freely present to the author under the 
term Spirit : Spirit in Nature, Spirit in Life, Spirit 
in Reason, Spirit in Christ, Spirit in History, Spirit 
in All Religions. Mr. Mozoomdar escapes mysti- 
cism more perfectly than most who are possessed 
of a like sweep and elevation of feeling. It is im- 
possible that some things should not seem mystical 
in an author whose experiences are so remote from 
those of the average man. His own firm hold on 
things is especially seen in the chapter on " The 
Spiritual Power of the Senses." The coherence of 
the volume does not lie in any nicety of delineation, 
any orderly accumulation of thought, but in the sin- 
gle centre to which the eye is always turning the 
spiritual glory of God in all his works. 

We have united these brief notices under the 
title, "The Natural and the Supernatural." The 
first volume, " Secularism," rests very flatly on the 
physical world. The last volume, " The Spirit of 
God," rises very freely and serenely into the empy- 
rean of spiritual life. Naturalism is the soul of 
the one; Supernaturalism of the other. Are these 
two things antagonistic ? Not if our vision is single 
and wide. The supernatural is the inner force of 
the natural ; the natural is the clear, definite expres- 
sion of the supernatural. We have the same para- 
ble in many forms. Life does not work beyond 
the chemical and physical powers at its disposal ; 
yet it disposes them in a way all its own. The mind 
of man does not transcend the nervous conditions 
which are its instruments ; but it uses these condi- 
tions, wields this instrument, for objects hidden in 
itself alone. The world is God's chosen rational term 
of expression ; but it is only an expression. The sub- 
stance of spiritual being lies deeper in the mind of 
God. The natural is thoroughly supernatural, not 
a bar to it, nor restraint upon it. When the super- 
natural pushes farther than it is wont, it is in no 
way other than itself. It is still the visible made 
vital by the invisible. Our first author has no more 
right to deny as hallucination the experiences of our 
last author, than the unpoetic mind has to charac- 
terize the impressions of the poetic mind as idle 
rhapsodies. The worlds in which the two live are 
very distinct, yet one world ; no more distinct, nor 
less distinct, than are the dark day dying out in 
the cold gray light of evening, and the morning 
breaking through a golden and roseate mist on the 
earth which it claims as all its own. The one au-

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Astronomical The results of Professor J. Norman 
significance of Lockyer's studies on the construc- 
Egyptian Temples. t j on> or i enta tion, and astronomical 
significance of the Egyptian Temples, written in 
the form of lectures delivered to classes in the 
School of Science at South Kensington, have now 
appeared in book form with the title " The Dawn 
of Astronomy" (Macmillan). The work opens up 
a wide field for speculation and for legitimate sci- 
entific research ; but one cannot escape the feel- 
ing that of the many points put forth, only a few 
are really established. Its outcome tends to show 
that the ancient Egyptian Temples, or at least some 
of them, were erected for an astronomical purpose ; 
and Professor Lockyer finds that different temples 
were erected for observing the rising and setting 
of different objects at certain seasons of the year. 
Since the Egyptian Temples are very numerous, 
and are oriented in all possible directions, it follows 
that they could not all be Temples of the Sun. 
Hence the author concludes that the various shrines 
were sacred to their respective deities, which were 
represented in the heavens by certain stars or con- 
stellations. In order to make his theory fit the 
facts, he takes account of the effects of Precession 
in changing the amplitudes at which the stars rise, 
and in this way, by taking stars small enough and 
spaces of time long enough, he can find some ex- 
planation of the orientation of nearly all the im- 
portant temples in Egypt. The whole argument 
seems to proceed upon the supposition that the tem- 
ples were erected mainly for astronomical purposes. 
But it will be evident to those who are at all fa- 
miliar with the religions of antiquity that this view 
is untenable. It is certain that the temples were 
erected mainly for religious purposes ; but since, in 
later times, the priesthood became a learned hier- 
archy, it is natural to suppose that some of the tem- 
ples served incidentally to secure astronomical ob- 
servations, and thus enabled the priests to discover 
the length of the year, and to institute the calendar, 
so that the religious and state festivals might be 
regularly observed. Most of that part of the work 
which treats of the year, the calendar, the Sothic 
period, etc., appears to be reasonably sound. It 
will also readily be conceded that a number of the 
temples may have been so oriented as to receive on 
their sacred altars (at sunrise) the light of the sun 
at the equinoxes or solstices. And it may be that 
some of the temples were so oriented as to receive 



the light of certain bright stars, such as Vega, Arc- 
turus, the Pleiades, Aldebaran, Sirius, and Canopus ; 
but when Mr. Lockyer contends that the Egyptians 
oriented temples to such small stars as a Ursae 
Majoris, and g Draconis, his argument can hardly 
be deemed worthy of serious consideration. It is 
known that the Egyptians worshipped the sun under 
the name of Ra, because they were aware that the 
whole world depends upon the light and heat of 
the sun ; they also worshipped Sirius under the name 
of Isis-Sothis, because the heliacal rising of Sirius 
heralded the rising of the Nile, upon which all life 
in the Nile Valley depended. It would therefore 
be natural to expect to find temples oriented to 
these fundamental celestial objects ; but Mr. Lock- 
yer's logic would imply that the temple-builders 
were primarily astronomers, and secondarily priests. 
Hence we may remark that while a number of the 
suggestions in " The Dawn of Astronomy " are in- 
teresting, and some of them doubtless correct, many 
of them are hypotheses pure and simple. The idea 
that astronomical considerations entered into the 
orientation of the Egyptian Temples is by no means 
new, and it had been treated in a scientific manner 
at an earlier date by Professor Nissen (" Reinisches 
Museum fur Philologie" 1885). Mr. Lockyer, 
however, deserves credit for presenting in a popu- 
lar form the results of scientific research, and for 
personally inspecting the temples and securing rough 
measures of their orientation, in some cases where 
such data were wanting. It is unfortunate that the 
book is somewhat permeated by small incidental 
errors, which would of themselves prevent the work 
from taking high rank as a scientific contribution. 
For instance, on page 8, the author says : " Plato, 
on the ground that the cube was the most perfect 
geometrical figure, imagined the earth to be a cube, 
the part of the earth known to the Greeks being on 
the upper surface." It has long been recognized by 
all critical scholars that Plato fully understood that 
the figure of the earth was spherical (Zeller's 
Grundriss der Geschichte der Griechischen Phil- 
osophie, page 131) ; the same was known to Par- 
menides and many other philosophers who preceded 
Plato. Mr. Lockyer's work does not treat of the 
beginning of the Greek Astronomy ; and since this 
is the real source of Astronomy proper, which de- 
pends upon exact observation and measurement, 
many will think that the title of the work should 
have been less comprehensive. It is well recognized 
by such authorities as Professor Zeller that Greek 
philosophy originated in Greece, and was not im- 
ported from the East, as the early and obscure tra- 
ditions declared. In like manner, contrary to gen- 
eral opinion, it has been shown by Whewell and 
others that Astronomy proper did not arise from 
the Astrology of Babylonia and Egypt ; Astronomy 
originated with the Greeks, at Athens and Alex- 
andria, whence it was spread throughout the Roman 
Empire. We conclude, therefore, that whilst Mr. 
Lockyer's work is not critical or exact, it deals with

investigation, and the general reader will find in it 
a fairly complete presentation of the results of the 
studies of Egyptologists.

by Mr. Richard Harding Davis, is 
sure of its welcome. Mr. Davis is an entertaining 
writer, clever, off-hand, pungent, not profound cer- 
tainly, yet not exactly superficial. No good ob- 
server is superficial ; and Mr. Davis is, after the 
rapid journalistic fashion, a very good one. If 
asked to define Mr. Davis's special genre, we might 
say that he is, in current parlance, an eminently 
"up to date " writer in phrase, tone, and equip- 
ment. Certainly the trait goes far to explain his 
vogue with the younger generation, whose literary 
dulce decus he now seems to be. They have de- 
cided unanimously, if not elegantly, in their figur- 
ative way, that Mr. Davis is " no back number "; 
which is high praise. He is master of their shib- 
boleths, knows their ways, understands their ideals, 
and embodies them (say in "Van Bibber") to an 
iota ; therefore they rejoice in him, and read him. 
They might do worse. In the present volume Mr. 
Davis presents the literary results of his recent 
jaunt to England, and it must be admitted he hits 
off John Bull remarkably well. He writes of En- 
glish Race Meetings and General Elections ; of the 
Oxford Undergraduate, the London Season, and 
the West and the East Ends of London ; and his 
sketches are brimful of incident, local color, and 
character. Especially good are the reproductions of 
dialect. Here is a sample of oratorical " chaff " 
from two rival clothes-dealers in " Petticoat Lane ": 
" Go on," one of the men will cry from the back of

liar, and 'is clothes is moth-eaten 

cholera blankets, robbed from 'ospitals and made 
over." To which the accused "'Ammerstein" (on 
the next cart), cheerfully replies: "You musd egs- 
cuse dot jail-birt on the nexd cart. He vas a clerk 
of mine, but he stole oud of der till, und I dis- 
charged him, und he feels bat aboud id." In the 
capital paper describing a General Election, Mr. 
Davis says, apropos of the part taken by women in 
the canvass : " I have seen women of the best class 
struck by stones and eggs and dead fish, and the 
game did not seem to me to be worth the candle. 
I confess that at the time I was so intent in admir- 



ing their pluck that it appeared to me rather fine 
than otherwise, but from this calmer distance I can 
see nothing in the active work of the English wo- 
man in politics which justifies the risks she volun- 
tarily runs of insult and indignity and bodily injury. 
A seat in the House would hardly repay a candidate 
for the loss of one of his wife's eyes, or of all of his 
sister's front teeth, and though that is putting it 
brutally, it is putting it fairly." Mr. Davis's book 
is a long way the brightest and freshest one of its 
kind that we have seen of late, and it is capitally 
illustrated. 

Until the appearance of Mr. Fal- 

con . er Madan ' s " Books in Manu - 

script " (imported by Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons), we had nothing on the subject, in handy- 
volume form, that served as adequate guide to the 
amateur. As Lecturer in Mediaeval Palaeography 
in the University of Oxford, and Bibliographer to 
the Bodleian Library, Mr. Madan has placed his 
rich store of knowledge at the service of those who 
wish to study the subject, and in the appendices 
to his book he has given us an ample bibliography 
compiled with great care and discretion. A list of 
Public Libraries that contain more than four thou- 
sand manuscripts each ; another of Printed Cata- 
logues of Manuscripts in European languages in the 
British Museum, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, 
the Cambridge University Library ; and still an- 
other list of books useful for the study of manu- 
scripts, enable us in a moment to find reference to 
the most minute and out-of-the-way information 
bearing on the subject. The printed book has so 
completely supplanted the work of the scribe that 
it is hard for us in the new world to realize what a 
wealth of manuscript material still rests in the de- 
positories of the eastern hemisphere. With the 
thousands upon thousands of printed books in 
American libraries, we are somewhat startled, on 
referring to Mr. Madan's work, to find we have 
no place in his list of Public Libraries containing 
more than four thousand manuscripts each. That 
there are manuscripts in the Lenox and Astor Li- 
braries of New York, and in our own Newberry 
Library, as well as in our private libraries, goes 
without saying ; but our poverty would be appar- 
ent on comparison with the British Museum and 
its 52,000 manuscripts, the National Library of 
Paris and its 80,000, or the Vatican and its 25,600. 
The manuscript treasures housed in the great in- 
stitutions of learning in the British Isles constitute 
one of the richest legacies left to an ungrateful pos- 
terity. A single instance of the wonderful human 
interest possessed by some of these relics of art and 
letters, described by Mr. Madan, is the " Book of 
Kells," the chief treasure of Trinity College, Dub- 
lin. The book takes its name from the Monastery 
of Kells, founded by St. Columba, and was written 
apparently in the seventh century. To abridge Mr. 
Madan's description, " the volume contains the 
Four Gospels in Latin, ornamented with extraor-

dinary freedom, elaboration, and beauty. It ex- 
hibits, both in form and color, all the signs of the 
full development and maturity of the Irish style, 
and must of necessity have been preceded by sev- 
eral generations of artistic workers, who founded 
and improved this particular school of art."

Co., the witticisms ot Sidney Smith 
and R. B. Sheridan making up the first, and " potted " 
puns by Charles Lamb and Douglas Jerrold the 
second. The third volume is devoted to Theodore 
Hook and Samuel Foote. Mr. Aubrey Beardsley 
decorates the margins of these comely volumes with 
"grotesques," and Mr. Walker Jerrold provides 
introductions. George Eliot has said that " a dif- 
ference of taste in jests is a great strain of the 
affections." But there is sufficient variety here. 
Sheridan's dictum was that " a true-trained wit lays 
his plan like a general," but one of his best sal- 
lies was made in the coffee-house as he watched the 
burning of his theatre : " Surely a man may take a 
glass of wine at his own fireside." Wit bubbled 
from Sidney Smith and Charles Lamb, as from a 
spring. Their Irish bulls had not been " calves in 
Greece." When Mrs. Grote, wife of the historian, 
entered a drawing-room with a rose-colored turban 
on her head, Sidney Smith at once knew the " mean- 
ing of the word grotesque." He tells us that Lady 
Cork was so moved by his sermon on the subject 
of charity that she begged a guinea of him for her 
contribution, and then spent the money on herself. 
Carlyle found Lamb's fun a " strain of the affec- 
tions," but this verdict will hardly be assented to by 
readers of these volumes. The publishers have done 
well in putting them into portable form ; either of 
them may be recommended for one's vest-pocket 
to be taken as medicinal pellets, " as often as needed." 

Mr. Brander Matthews's " Studies 
of the Stage" (Harper), though a 
book small as to size, is not small or 
insignificant as to contents, since it deals with some 
of the most interesting subjects now under discus- 
sion in relation to dramatic art. Professor Mat- 
thews announces in a prefatory note that he is 
" quite willing to have this little volume considered 
as an argument in favor of the contention that dra- 
matic literature must approve itself as drama first, 
before it need be discussed as literature." The first 
of the ten essays composing the volume considers 
the subject of " The Dramatization of Novels," and 
shows the reasons why a good novel frequently fails 
to make a good play ; in fact, how the difficulty in 
dramatizing it is increased in proportion to its del- 
icacy and delightf ulness in workmanship, its subtlety 
in psychology, and its fineness of treatment. The 
dramatist works under much greater limitations 
than the novelist. He is restricted as to subject, 
since he is obliged to choose such an one as will in- 
terest the broad public ; as to treatment, since he

must adopt that which the broad public will accept ; 
as to dimensions, since his work must be bulky 
enough to last*from half-past eight to half -past ten 
at the shortest, or from eight to eleven at the long- 
est ; as to characters, since there must be so many 
that no one shall seem unduly obtrusive, and, al- 
though sharply contrasted, most of them must be 
sympathetic with the spectators ; and, above all, he 
is restricted as to external aids, since neither de- 
scription nor comment nor analysis is available to 
him for showing the progressive and well-nigh im- 
perceptible disintegration of character under the 
influence of its environment or circumstance. But 
the drama, notwithstanding these metes and bounds 
in fact, because of them has always had a fas- 
cination for the literary artist ; it is really the no- 
blest form of literature, because the most direct. 
Other important subjects discussed by Professor 
Matthews are : " The Dramatic Outlook in Amer- 
ica," which is regarded as highly favorable ; " The 
Old Comedies "- which seem less wonderful than 
they are commonly considered, when we note that 
only about twenty-five survive to-day, out of a list 
of five thousand written during the century and a 
half preceding our own generation ; and two de- 
lightful bits of comment and analysis of the two 
French theatrical critics, M. Francisque Sarcey and 
M. Jules Lemaitre. 



Venetian 
painters and 
paintings. 



Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have 
made an exceedingly pretty volume 
o f Mr Bernhard Berenson's essay 
on "The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance." 
Mr. Berenson's essay owes its origin to his belief 
that Venetian painting is the most complete expres- 
sion in art of the Italian Renaissance ; and in order 
to keep his main idea clearly before the mind of 
the reader he has written as succinctly as possible, 
pruning away all matter not strictly relevant to his 
thesis. The main points once grasped and con- 
nected with the more important painters, the reader 
will find little difficulty in seeing the proper place 
of any given work by a great master, or the relative 
importance of second-rate and third-rate painters of 
whom no special mention has been made. Apart 
from its purely critical value, the work makes a 
useful handbook to Venetian painting to which 
end lists are appended of the chief works, in and 
out of Italy, of the Venetian school. There is an 
especially attractive frontispiece after Giorgione's 
" Shepherd " at Hampton Court. 

Two books about insects, intended for 
popular reading, have recently been 
published. The first of them, entitled 
" Romance of the Insect World " (Macmillan ), is the 
work of Mr. L. N. Badenoch. In half a dozen pleas- 
antly-written chapters the author treats of the food, 
the homes, and the metamorphoses of insects, and of 
the various cases of protective mimicry that so puz- 
zled the observer until Darwin supplied the key to 
the mystery. The other book is by Mr. Edward A.

Butler, and has for its subject " Our Household In-

evidently views them as interesting objects of study 
rather than as obnoxious things to get rid of, and 
the housewife who is incapable of rising to the 
scientific plane of observation will have no use for 
this book. But amateur naturalists will find it both

Contemporary 



J n a handsomely-printed volume, lim- 
ited to an edition of 250 copies, Mr. 

of Washington. Wm}am g pohn Baker hag collected 

from many sources the " Early Sketches of George 
Washington" (Lippincott). The first account of 
Washingtbn that may fairly be called a biography 
was compiled by Thomas Condie, and published 
at Philadelphia in 1798. Mr. Baker's collection 
comprises only accounts anterior to this publication, 
the most important of them (by John Bell and 
Jedidiah Morse) having been freely used by Condie. 
They range from 1760 to 1795, the first being from 
a letter written to a friend in Europe by Captain 
George Mercer, descriptive of Washington's per- 
sonal appearance at twenty-eight. Among the 
sketches are some from Tory pens ; and it is inter- 
esting, for example, to read in one of them that 
Washington's " total want of generous sentiments, 
and even of common humanity, has appeared no- 
toriously in many instances." 

An altogether capital sheaf of war 
stories, each by one specially quali- 
ified to tell it, is the Century Co.'s 
" Famous Adventures and Prison Escapes of the 
Civil War." The papers, seven in number, are re- 
printed, with the original cuts, from the Century 
Magazine. Notably graphic and stirring are the 
accounts of " The Locomotive Chase in Georgia," 
" Morgan's Rough-riders," and " Colonel Rose's Tun- 
nel at Libby Prison." The last named paper, by 
Frank E. Moran, gives, we believe, the only accu- 
rate and circumstantial account yet published of 
this most ingenious and daring escape an adven- 
ture before which the half-mythical feats of Jack 
Sheppard and Turpin sink into insignificance. The 
book should prove specially fascinating to younger 
readers, and it is wholesome and accurate into the 
bargain. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The " Athenaeum Press " series, published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co., " is intended to furnish a library of the 
best English literature from Chaucer to the present 
time, in a form adapted to the needs of both the stu- 
dent and the general reader." This is perhaps a trifle 
misleading as an account of a series of books which, if 
we may judge from the one now before us, would be 
better described as a series of critically edited texts se- 
lected from the best English literature, and mainly use- 
ful for college study. The volume just issued is a " Se- 



lection from the Essays of Francis Jeffrey," and is ed- 
ited by Mr. Lewis E. Gates, of Yale University. It 
probably contains all of Jeffrey that the general reader, 
or even the student, will want. 

Two or three books of popular science call for brief 
mention. " Some Salient Points in the Science of the 
Earth," by Sir William Dawson (Harper) has all the 
charm of that accomplished writer's earlier books for 
the general reader. Some of his conclusions are over- 
conservative, and will gain little assent from the younger 
geologists; but no one can question the great ability of 
the writer, or his high rank among the scientists of a gen- 
eration that has now nearly passed away. " The Fauna 
of the Deep Sea " (Appleton) is a popular treatise by 
Mr. Sidney J. Hickson, and brings together a good many 
scattered facts of recent determination. The govern- 
ment scientific expeditions of recent years have furnished 
the writer with the bulk of his material. " According 
to Season " (Scribner) is a little book by Mrs. William 
Starr Dana, and is made up of " talks about the flowers 
in the order of their appearance in the woods and fields." 
It is charmingly written in entirely untechnical language. 

For many years, the Rev. T. W. Webb's " Celestial 
Objects for Common Telescopes " (Longmans) has been 
in use by astronomical amateurs, who have found it 
helpful if not indispensable in their work. The new 
(fifth) edition of the book has been prepared by the 
Rev. T. E. Espin, the author having died nearly ten 
years ago. It will occupy two volumes, of which the 
first, devoted to the solar system, has just appeared. 
The new editor (or author) has called a number of spe- 
cialists to his assistance, and made the book far more 
valuable than ever, which is as high a compliment as we 
know how to pay it. 

Volume by volume, the proceedings of the World's 
Congress Auxiliary of 1893 are getting into print, and 
the outside world is becoming acquainted with the range 
and weight of the discussions held upon that occasion. 
The latest publication of this sort takes the shape of 
two large volumes from the International Congress of 
Charities (Johns Hopkins Press). " Hospitals, Dispen- 
saries, and Nursing " are the allied subjects dealt with 
in the thicker of these volumes, which is edited by Dr. 
John S. Billings and Dr. Henry M. Hurd. It contains 
many plates illustrative of hospital architecture. The 
other volume deals with " The Organization of Chari- 
ties," and is edited by President Gilman of the Johns 
Hopkins University. The two volumes taken together 
contain over eleven hundred pages of matter, most of 
it of the highest practical value. 

The Bishop of Peterborough's great " History of the 
Papacy during the Period of the Reformation " (Long- 
man's) has reached its fifth volume, which is devoted 
to the German revolt of the decade 1517-1527. Luther 
is, of course, the chief figure of this portion of the his- 
tory. The concluding chapter describes the sack of 
Rome in 1527. An appendix reprints a number of im- 
portant contemporary documents, the most important 
of them being the letters of Gambara, Giberti, and Guic- 
ciardini. 

In " Sunny Manitoba: Its Peoples and Its Industries " 
(Unwin), Mr. Alfred O. Legge writes with temperate 
enthusiasm of the Canadian Northwest. His book, 
which has both a map and pictures, will be found use- 
ful by the intending visitor or settler, and not uninter- 
esting by the general reader. It contains a good deal 
of practical and up-to-date information.

NEW YORK TOPICS. 

New York, April 10, 1894. 

Readers of " Scribner's Magazine " will remember a 
notable article in one of the earlier numbers, in 1887, 
I think, on " The Ethics of Democracy," written by Mr. 
Frederic Jesup Stimson, who is a lawyer and a writer 
of law books as well as of novels. In the course of his 
studies it had devolved upon him to examine and com- 
pare all the statute books of the United States. This 
examination and comparison bad called his attention to 
certain socialistic tendencies in our legislation, and led 
him to the conclusion that " measures of universal social- 
ism, although in no case yet enacted, appear to be on the 
verge of a trial "; also, to " the perhaps unforeseen result, 
that democracy, when crowned with power, seeks rather 
what it considers the well-being of the community than 
the liberty of the individual." This article of Mr. Stirn- 
son's created a good deal of discussion at the time. It 
was quoted in the House of Commons, and it brought 
the author a complimentary letter from Mr. James 
Bryce, who was then just completing his " American 
Commonwealth." The enormous success of Mr. Ed- 
ward Bellamy's " Looking Backward " in the following 
year would seem, in a certain way, to have confirmed 
Mr. Stimson's discovery. 

Without expressing any opinion as to the merits or 
demerits of universal socialism, it is interesting to state 
that Mr. Stimson will have in the May " Scribner's " 
another equally pertinent article on the same subject. 
He has examined and tabulated all the laws passed by 
all the States and Territories during the years 1889 and 
1890 with reference to their socialistic character. Leav- 
ing out all private laws, regulative acts, etc., which in- 
volve no principle of social science, he has examined 
some twelve hundred laws, and of these he finds that 
almost thirty per cent are distinctly socialistic in char- 
acter. The percentage varies, according to the section, 
from twenty per cent in the New England States to 
over forty per cent in the North and Northwestern 
States. In the light of these facts, Mr. Stimson asks, 
Are we still in possession of our liberty ? " Yes," he 
writes, " we are still free. But no candid mind can 
rise from the perusal of these twelve hundred laws 
which a single period of two years brings upon us with- 
out the desire to call attention, if not to warn." Grant- 
ing Mr. Stimson's premises, his article is extremely in- 
teresting. 

" Chronological Outlines of American Literature," by 
Mr. Selden L. Whitcomb, which Messrs. Macmillan & 
Co. will bring out late in the Spring, is, I am told, the 
first really scientific work of the kind yet published. 
It is, of course, uniform with Ryland's " Chronological 
Outlines of English Literature," and it contains tables 
of comparison with English and Continental literature 
as well as with historical events. Mr. Whitcomb is a 
fellow in literature at Columbia College, and Prof. 
Brander Matthews of that institution has written an in- 
troduction for the volume. Professor Mattbews's own 
book, " Vignettes of Manhattan," will be published later 
in the season, from the press of the Harpers. Some of 
these " Vignettes " appear first in the magazine, but 
there are twelve of them in all, the aim being to pre- 
sent a picture of New York for each month in the year. 
Mr. Luther J. B. Lincoln's " Uncut Leaves " readings 
end the season with next Saturday's meeting, when Mrs. 
Burnett will give her first reading in New York, and 
other writers will take part. This has been the most 



successful year of " Uncut Leaves " yet, and what at 
first seemed a slightly unpractical plan has turned out 
to be eminently practical and the means of bringing 
together under pleasant circumstances a large number 
of highly cultured people. 

A few friends of the English poet and novelist Mr. 
William Sharp have received from him copies of his 
last book, "Vistas." It is composed of a series of dra- 
matic sketches, in which the descriptive text occupies 
as much space as the dialogue. " Vistas " is the second 
volume of the " Regent Library," a series of books of 
romance by various authors, which deal with human 
emotions and passions in an unconventional spirit. Mr. 
Sharp in his dedication speaks of " Vistas " as " ce livre 
d'ame et de reve," and this description is wonderfully 
accurate. The succeeding volume of the " Regent Li- 
brary " will be Pharais " by Fiona Macleod, the scene 
of which romance is laid among the lonely islands which 
lie between the Hebrides and Argyll. It seems that a 
" Celtic Renaissance " is now in progress in England, 
and this book is a manifestation of the Scottish side of 
the movement, the Welsh side of which is represented 
by the experiments of Mr. Ernest Rhys in Kymric pros- 
ody, already mentioned in this correspondence. The 
Cymmrodorion Society has, I learn, just reprinted Mr. 
Rhys's paper on " Welsh Bards and English Reviewers," 
which created some discussion on its original delivery, 
and in which there is a prediction of the brilliant ca- 
reer open to Celtic literature under modern conditions. 

A long-time literary friend of Constance Woolson 
has asked a lady now visiting in Rome to place a wreath 
for him on Miss Woolson's grave in the Protestant cem- 
etery. The letter he received in reply is so interesting 
that I have obtained permission to quote a few lines 
from it: 

"The cypress-sentineled garden, with the filtered golden 
light caught up by the new green of the budding willows be- 
neath, the heavy velvet fall of violets flung everywhere, can 
never be more beautiful than it was this afternoon. The 
flowers here are as plentiful as dust anywhere else, and our 
man caught our idea and made a lovely thing, all violets, 
white azaleas and camellias, with an outer fringe of fern and 
white hyacinth. . . . Her grave is purple with the violets 
that flood everything they flow up like waves over each new 
wreckage. . . . I send you two from Shelley's grave under 
the shadow of the crumbling wall two from your friend's, 
and the box leaves from Keats', most touching of all with its 
piteous epitaph, but very beautiful, almost joyous, in the royal 
Italian sunshine. Over the ripe old wall, and all along the 
foot of the Aventine Hill, the almond and cherry trees are in 
bloom, and still the west wind ' sends sweet buds like flocks 
to feed in air.' "

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard is to make his not very 
youthful debut as a lecturer this spring at Cleveland, 
the subject of his course being " English Lyrical Poetry." 

Miss Elizabeth Robins, who has played in several of 
Dr. Ibsen's dramas with much success, is to visit this 
country, and will probably appear in " Hedda Gabler," 
" The Master Builder," and other dramas. 

Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co. announce " The 
Royal Natural History," to be edited by Mr. Richard 
Lydekker, in thirty-six monthly parts, each to contain 
two colored plates and many other illustrations. 

Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman, late United States consul, 
has assumed business and editorial charge of "The 
Overland Monthly." Miss Shinn will remain " some- 
what closely connected with the literary management." 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. are to publish a sympo- 
sium, edited by Mr. Thomas Mackay, on " A Policy of 
Free Exchange "; "A Yellow Aster," by Mrs. Manning- 
ton Caffyn ; and the memoirs of the Baron de Meneval, 
Napoleon's private secretary. 

Some of the friends of the late Theodore Child have 
raised a sum of over seven hundred dollars to be used 
for a memorial. It has been sent to the American Pres- 
byterian Mission in Tabriz, Persia, where Mr. Child was 
cared for during his illness with the cholera. Probably 
it will be used to establish a hospital room or bed, to be 
known by his name. 

The Clarendon Press announces a posthumous vol- 
ume of Freeman's "History of Sicily," covering the 
period from the tyranny of Dionysios to the death of 
Agathokles. It has been edited from his MSS. by his 
son-in-law, Mr. Arthur J. Evans, who has also added 
supplements and notes. It will be illustrated with maps 
and a plate of coins. 

It is understood that one of the most prominent mem- 
bers of New York society is shortly to make a debut 
in literature. The name of the coming author is known 
throughout the country and the book is certain to at- 
tract general attention. It appears that the writer has 
devoted much time to scientific studies, and the book is 
said to be a romance of the future showing remarkable 
knowledge and ingenuity in the development of the pos- 
sibilities of science. 

As an outgrowth of the Parliament of Religions of 
last September, an American Congress of Liberal Reli- 
gious Societies will be held May 22-24, at Sinai Tem- 
ple, Chicago. The call for this Congress is signed by 
many Unitarian, Universalist, and Jewish clergymen, 
as well as by such well-known laymen as Professor 
John Fiske, President J. G. Schurman, Dr. Paul Carus, 
Mr. Henry D. Lloyd, and Mrs. Potter Palmer. Dr. H. 
W. Thomas is chairman of the committee in charge, 
and may be addressed at 175 Dearborn street, Chicago. 

Mr. Francis P. Harper, New York, announces that 
he will have ready early in April a new edition of the 
" Memoirs of King Richard the Third, and some of his 
Contemporaries," by John Heneage Jesse, who has been 
called the " Francis Parkman of English History." It 
will be published in two volumes, post octavo, with illus- 
trations printed on Japan paper. The same house makes 
the announcement that Dr. Elliott Coues is editing Ma- 
jor Z. M. Pike's " Explorations and Discoveries through 
the West and South- West during the years 1805-1806- 
1807." The work will be published uniform with the 
edition of Lewis and Clark. 

The " Phormio " of Terence is to be given at Har- 
vard on the nineteenth of this month (Concord Day). 



The libretto (Cambridge: Sever) includes the text, an 
English prose translation (highly vernacular) by Mr. 
M. H. Morgan, a prologue in verse (Latin and English) 
by Jac. Br. Gronovius (in such guise does Professor 
James B. Greenough masquerade for the occasion), and 
a series of twenty-six miniatures reproduced from a 
tenth century manuscript. This manuscript is one of 
the treasures of the Vatican, His Holiness the Pope 
having consented to a reproduction for the present pur- 
pose of these curious illustrations. This book of the 
play is well worth preservation on its own account. 

The following quatrain is from " London Nursery 
Rhymes for Novelists": 

"John Oliver Hobbes, with your spasms and throbs, 

How does your novel grow ? 
With cynical sneers at young Love and his tears, 

And epigrams all in a row." 

The following Southey autograph, recently sold in 
London, is contributed to " Poet-Lore " by Mr. W. G. 
Kingsland :

OUTLOOK IN THE PUBLISHING TRADE. 

The following interesting remarks on " The Spring 
Outlook " are quoted from a recent editorial in the 
" Publisher's Weekly " : 

" The book trade through all the panic has suffered 
less than almost any other branch of trade from which 
we have had reports. Publishing activity during the 
past six months, or, more strictly speaking, up to within 
two months, has been without abatement ; if anything, 
it has been a trifle more than normal. Since the begin- 
ning of February there has been a tendency to put on 
the brakes, which can but be considered a healthy sign. 

" We think there has been decidedly too much un- 
healthy activity in the publishing world here as well as 
abroad. A few weeks ago we gave a glimpse of the 
conditions of the book trade and literature in France. 
They are not much better in England, nor anywhere 
else, excepting possibly in Germany, where a rigid trade 
organization, and more conservative and scientific pub- 
lishing methods generally tend to preserve the equilib- 
rium. 

" The tendency of modern publishing, as in other 
trades, has been towards over-production, without re- 
gard to the capacity for consumption. This has brought 
about a congestion that has entailed unnumbered hard- 
ships upon the bookseller, has rendered the public apa- 
thetic, and is beginning to react on the publisher. 
So, for instance, during the past season the publishers 
have had no trouble in disposing of the new books the 
fads of the hour while their best books of previous 
seasons rested idly in their bins. There is no overlook- 
ing the fact that books require leisure to read, and that 
the publisher who markets a few books well will in the 
end fare better than the one who indifferently tumbles 
many into the market."

THE DIAL'S CONTRIBUTORS. 

The following list of THE DIAL'S contributors is published for the purpose of showing how varied are the intel- 
lectual interests represented by the review, and how serious and authoritative its contents. It will be noticed that

reason to be proud of a list that includes the chief justice of the United States, presidents or professors of some 
thirty colleges and universities, and many of the most distinguished private scholars in the country.

A Journey in Other Worlds. 

A Romance of the Future. By JOHN JACOB ASTOR. 

Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In this romance the author develops the possibilities of sci- 
ence in the year 2000. He describes a new force which en- 
ables the hero and his friends to visit Jupiter and Saturn, 
where they make some remarkable discoveries and have va- 
rious surprising adventures. As a romance the book is most 
interesting, and it is also most stimulating in its suggestive- 
ness regarding the possible results of the science of the future. 
The author has devoted himself to scientific subjects, and the 
ingenious use which he makes of his knowledge will be cer- 
tain to enlist the interest of readers. Mr. Dan Beard, work- 
ing in perfect sympathy with the text, has produced a series 
of unusually effective illustrations. 



Ladies in the Field. 

Edited by the Lady GREVILLE. Articles on Sport by 
the Duchess of Newcastle, Diane Chasseresse, Mrs. 
Chaworth Musters, Miss Anstruther, Lady Greville, 
Mrs. Martelli, Lady Boynton, Mrs. Pennell, Miss 
Leale, Mrs. Jenkins, and Miss Salaman. Crown 8vo, 
cloth, $2.00. 

" The book has our heartiest praise. No sportswoman should deny 
herself its perusal. . . . Written with a lively sense of the delights of 
the sport each is concerned with." Black and White. 

" Here are all the sports in which women engage, or nearly all. Be 
interested in which you please, a glance will tell you just how far wo- 
men have got i. ., just how far timider women may with all propriety 
follow. ... It comes with the authority of good names, and there is 
something engagingly modest, businesslike, and simple in the way each 
author has addressed herself to the description of her favorite pastime." 
London Chronicle. 



A Short History of the Crusades. 

By J. I. MOMBERT, D.D., author of " Charles the Great," 
etc. With Two Maps. 12mo, pp. 300, cloth, $1.50. 
This work presents to busy people a narrative of the grand 
drama of the Crusades. It traverses the whole ground, de- 
picting on contemporary authority, and in the light of impar- 
tial criticism, the character and motives of the actors, the 
kernel and worth of their deeds. 



A History of the United States 

Navy. 

From 1775 to 1894. By EDGAR STANTON MACLAY, 
A.M. With Technical Revision by Lieut. ROY C. 
SMITH, U.S. N. In two volumes. Vol.1. With nu- 
merous Maps, Diagrams, and Illustrations. 8vo, 
cloth; price, $3.50 per volume. 

" No better excuse for this important work could be desired than 
that a navy with such a brilliant career on the whole as has the Amer- 
ican navy is without a full and continuous record of its achievement. 
. . . The author has important new facts to tell, and he tells them in 
a clear and graceful literary style." Hartford Post. 

"Mr. Maclay has deservedly won for himself an enviable place 
among our American historians. . . . His researches have been ex- 
haustive and his inquiries persistent, and he has used his wealth of ma- 
terial with a proper appreciation of historical value." Boston Ad- 
vertiser. 



The Trespasser. 

By GILBERT PARKER, author of " The Translation of a 
Savage," "Pierre and his People," etc. No. 141 , 
Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; 
cloth, $1.00. 

"Mr. Parker is in a very high degree vigorous and fresh both in 
subject and manner of writing, and it is to these qualities solely that 
his success is due and is deserved." The Outlook. 

" Mr. Gilbert Parker is one of those fortunate writers who leap into 
estimation at a single bound." London Literary World. 



A Policy of Free Exchange. 

Essays by Various Writers, on the Economical and So- 
cial Aspects of Free Exchange and Kindred Subjects. 
Edited by THOMAS MAC KAY, editor of " A Plea for 
Liberty." 8vo, cloth, $4.00. 

Vital economic questions of the day are treated in this vol- 
ume by recognized authorities. Among the chapters of thi& 
important work are : " The Coming Industrial Struggle," by 
William Maitland ; " National Workshops," by St. Loe Stra- 
chey ; "The State in Relation to Railways," by W. M. Ac- 
worth ; "The Principle of Progression in Taxation," by Ber-

Hon. Alfred Lyttelton.

Life, with Selections from his Published Writings 
and Extracts from his correspondence with Spencer, 
Huxley, Tyndall, and Others. By JOHN FISKR. 
With two Portraits. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

" His was a life at once inspiring and interesting. His career gave 
to manhood in America an ornament as well as a potent example. 
While he lived he helped to enrich thousands of lives. Now that he 
has gone, Prof. Fiske's beautiful biography not only shows us how noble 
the man himself was, but how great was the public loss, and how pre- 
cious must remain the possession of such a memory." New York 
Times. 



Aphorisms from the Writings 
of Herbert Spencer. 

Selected and arranged by JULIA RAYMOND GINGELL. 

With Portrait. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
"These selections arranged under appropriate topics, have been 
made with great care, and were submitted to Mr. Spencer for his ap- 
proval before publication. They offer good illustrations of the style 
and thought of the philosopher, and will give many persons who do not 
care to study them deeper an intelligent idea of his writings." New 
York Observer. 



Memories of My Exile. 

By Louis KOSSUTH. Translated from the orginal Hun- 
garian by FERENCZ JAUSZ. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 
The present widespread interest in the life of the great

CAN A DIAN LITERA TURE. 

Our esteemed contemporary over the north- 
ern border, " The Week " of Toronto, has re- 
cently been publishing a series of letters from 
Canadian writers of more or less repute, upon 
the subject of the Canadian literature which 
they unite in thinking ought to result from the 
literary activity of the younger generation, but 
which they regretfully admit to have given as yet 
hardly any signs of existence. The term litera- 
ture has many meanings, but we are now using 
it (as these anxious inquirers seem to use it) 
for the purpose of designating such writings as 
produce a distinct impression upon the mass 
of the people in whose language it is written. 
In this sense, no production of merely local 
interest or appeal may be called literature, how- 
ever vehemently its friends may put forward 
a claim to the title. In this sense, the United 
States has not yet produced any great quantity 
of literature, while Canada and Australia have 
produced, we may almost say, none at all. En- 
gland can still claim most of the writers whose 
audience is coextensive with the English-speak- 
ing world ; there are a few names from our 
own country, such as those of Emerson and 
Longfellow, upon the list ; the other English- 
peopled lands remain unrepresented. 

The test that we have suggested is doubtless 
a severe one, and there is no other language 
whose literature must, as a condition of success, 
answer to the wants of so many communities 
geographically so far apart. On the other hand, 
there is no language comparable with our own 
in the compensations which it offers to the suc- 
cessful man of letters. He who gains the ear 
of the English-speaking world commands an 
audience so vast that the imagination does not 
easily grasp it, and his reward, whether in profit 
or in fame, is proportional to the numbers of 
those whom he addresses. It is vain to deny 
the unifying effect of a language upon the com- 
munities that share its use ; however alien the 
race - elements concerned, a common bond of 
speech must make them one in sympathy and 
in ideals. 

Looked at from this point of view, the ques- 
tion of Canadian literature is very simple. 
There are not many Canadians altogether (for 



260 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



the French are not to be included in this cal- 
culation), and it is only within a very few years 
that the conditions have been found under which 
the very existence of literature is possible. 
When the " epic passion " of a people has to 
vent itself in the felling of forests and the 
building of cities, there is little chance to cul- 
tivate the rather exotic flower of literature, and 
poets are likely to be of the inarticulate sort so 
dear to Mr. Carlyle. Other reasons for the 
non-existence of a Canadian literature are fur- 
nished by the contributors to "The Week." 
One of these reasons is found in the fact that 
there is no recognized intellectual centre for 
English Canada. Toronto comes nearer than 
any other city to being such a centre, but To- 
ronto is still so provincial, we are told, that it 
seems to have a prejudice against books pro- 
duced outside of Ontario. Another reason is 
the absorption of Canadian literary talent by 
the publishers and magazine editors of the 
United States. Still another reason is the ten- 
dency of Canadian writers to produce hasty 
and slovenly work. This is brought forward 
by Dr. Bourinot, who certainly speaks with 
authority. But no reasons are really needed 
to explain so natural a fact as that of a small 
and struggling community, as yet hardly in- 
fused with national feelings, having produced 
no distinctive literature of its own. 

Of course we do not ignore the fact that 
many Canadian writers have done excellent 
work in prose and verse. Haliburton and De 
Mille, for example, among those who have 
passed away, Professor Roberts and Mr. Car- 
man, for example, among the younger men, are 
widely known, as widely in this country as in 
their own. And Canada has at least half own- 
ership in that great scholar and profound polit- 
ical thinker, Professor Goldwin Smith. But 
these excellent writers, and a dozen more whose 
names at once occur to any well-informed per- 
son, are not enough to make a literature, at 
best they add but a slender rill tributary to the 
broad stream of English letters. 

One thing is quite certain : Talking about a 
national literature and the desirability of hav- 
ing one will not do anything to stimulate its 
emergence. Literature is almost never the pro- 
duct of self-consciousness ; self-conscious pe- 
riods in the life of a nation may precede or fol- 
low periods of productivity, but the two are 
not likely to coincide. Some day, when our 
Canadian friends have ceased to scan the hori- 
zon for the coming literature, and have turned 
to thinking about other things, they may make 



the happy discovery that a literature has been 
growing up unnoticed in their midst. But we 
do not expect it for some time, and we are sure 
that it will not come with observation. There 
is a good deal in this discussion of " The Week " 
to remind us of discussions not unfamiliar in 
our own country. With us the question is 
somewhat more complicated, for we have not 
only loud outcries for an American literature, 
but still louder and more blatant demands for 
a Western, or a Southern, or a Mississippi 
Valley, or a Pacific Coast literature. 

Reduced to this absurdity, the contention be- 
comes merely amusing, and is made none the 
less so by the efforts of our too-zealous section- 
alists to decry the work done in older and more 
cultivated intellectual centres, and to exalt, by 
all the devices of the clique for mutual admir- 
ation, every petty local performance. We are 
not even sure that the demand for a distinct- 
ively national literature of our own is a justi- 
fiable one, and we may certainly be permitted 
to doubt the wisdom of a similar demand for a 
Canadian literature. One of the " Week" corre- 
spondents speaks of certain causes which " tend 
to intensify the general movement towards 
literary centralization throughout the English- 
speaking world, and to choke the independent 
literary life of the smaller communities." In- 
stead of deprecating this tendency, as the 
writer seems to do, we are inclined to think it 
a fortunate one. The best literary life for the 
small community is likely to be a life fed from 
the best sources of inspiration, and drawing its 
nourishment from the common stock of English 
literary achievement. It seems to us that no 
other than a stunted literary life would be pos- 
sible for a community that should seek a strictly 
independent development. The great tradition 
of expression, as embodied in the five centuries 
of our literary production since Chaucer first 
fashioned English speech for the purposes of 
art, is too splendid a heritage to be disdained 
or lightly cast aside. There is but one English 
literature at present, and we hope that there 
will never be more than one. Of the many 
things that make for unity among all English- 
speaking people, literature is the most import- 
ant, and experience affords no warrant for the 
apprehension that unity may ever generate into 
mere uniformity. 

" In der Beschrankung zeigt sich erst der 
Meister," said Goethe. For the literary artist 
who has as a medium of expression the English 
language, whether he live and work in the 
United States or in Canada, in Africa or in 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



261 



Australia, the lesson of this dictum must be 
that truth to himself will always mean truth to 
the English literary tradition, coupled with a 
recognition and a cheerful acceptance of what- 
ever limitations that tradition may be found to 
impose. 



ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF ILLINOIS.* 



The courses in English at the Illinois State Uni- 
versity being at present confined to the undergrad- 
uate classes, an account of the work must differ ma- 
terially from one dealing with the full university 
curriculum. The aim of such a course is, or should 
be, the development of general culture rather than 
the preparation for later scientific research. It aims 
to be, as far as possible, complete in itself. 

Keeping this end in view, we devote the whole 
of the first year to a general survey of English and 
American literature, dwelling particularly on the 
great names and the significant periods. From this 
as a centre all the subsequent courses are made to 
radiate. Those students, furthermore, who wish to 
devote only a single year to the subject are thus 
given a bird's-eye view, which, while necessarily in- 
complete and superficial, is the best substitute for 
an extended course. In connection with this sub- 
ject, as with all others, much outside reading is re- 
quired. 

In the three succeeding years the time is divided 
as equally as possible between two subjects, so that 
the students may have variety without distraction. 
In the junior and senior years the line is drawn 
between language and literature, and anyone so de- 
siring may elect only one of these. As might be 
expected, the preference in the large majority of 
cases is given to the latter subject. This compara- 
tive unpopularity of language-study suggests the 
advisability of providing a special course of one or 
two terms in elementary Old English (Anglo- 
Saxon) grammar and prose for literary students. 
This is the more desirable as the earliest period of 
our literature cannot satisfactorily be included in 
the general survey, and yet some knowledge of it is 
essential to a comprehensive knowledge of our lit- 
erary development. It is also a serious question 
whether Chaucer should be studied in the language 
course, as at present. But in any case, stress should 
be laid, in an ordinary college course such as ours, 



* This article is the seventh of an extended series on the 
Teaching of English at American Colleges and Universities, 
of which the following have already appeared in THE DIAL : 
English at Yale University, by Professor Albert S. Cook 
(Feb. 1); English at Columbia College, by Professor Bran- 
der Matthews (Feb. 16) ; English at Harvard University, by 
Professor Barrett Wendell (March 1) ; English at Stanford 
University, by Professor Melville B. Anderson (March 16);

(April 1) ; and English at the University of Virginia, by Pro- 
fessor Charles W. Kent (April 16). [DB. DIAL.] 



upon his artistic and ethical qualities, rather than 
upon the language in which these find expression. 

But of far greater importance is the question of 
how to approach Shakespeare. It is bad enough to 
confine ourselves to the grammatical forms of Chau- 
cer ; it is little far from criminal to do so with our 
mighty dramatist. Not that the grammatical and 
linguistic side shall be ignored ; it must, however, 
be reduced to a minimum, as a means to a greater 
end. Richard Grant White to the contrary, Shake- 
speare requires much annotation of various kinds, 
in order that the study may yield its full return. 
Our Shakespeare class devotes two hours a week 
throughout the year to the detailed investigation of 
four plays a comedy, an historical play, a tragedy, 
and one of the so-called romances. One hour a week 
during the first term is devoted to the pre-Shake- 
spearian drama, and the same time during the last 
two terms to the reading of eight or ten of Shake- 
speare's plays in the order of Furnivall's chronolog- 
ical table, bearing chiefly in mind the development 
of the author's genius. In these " Hamlet " is in- 
variably included. Free discussion by the members 
of the class is heartily encouraged. Special stress 
is laid upon the different conceptions of characters 
and situations by leading actors, and upon the stage 
requirements of the plays, the student being never 
allowed to forget that Shakespeare wrote primarily 
for the stage and not for the closet. Textual crit- 
icism is treated even more sparingly than grammat- 
ical study, its proper place being in the advanced 
courses. The results of this method of Shake- 
speare study have been very encouraging, many of 
the pupils seeming to develop from it a real love 
for the subject, which it is to be hoped may be car- 
ried still further outside of the college walls. 

The other courses offered are the prose of the 
nineteenth century, the poetry of the nineteenth 
century, special stress being laid in the former on 
the novel, in the latter on "Wordsworth, Browning, 
and Tennyson, eighteenth century literature, the lit- 
erary study of history, and Old and Early English, 
including Chaucer. There is also a special course 
of one year for scientific and engineering students, 
consisting of a general survey of the literature, En- 
glish grammar, and the critical study of scientific 
prose. 

In addition to the instruction in language and lit- 
erature, which is elective, a certain amount of work 
is required in rhetoric and theme-writing of all mem- 
bers of the university, the object of which is the 
practical one of endeavoring to give training in the 
use of English. Much freedom is left to the stu- 
dents in the choice of subjects, and satisfactory ar- 
ticles in the college paper and the various college 
societies are accepted as equivalents for the regu- 
lar class themes. This latter plan has yielded ad- 
mirable results this year, the first of its trial. 

It may be added that while, as has been stated, 
no attempt has yet been made to offer systematic 
instruction in English for graduates, provision is

INTERPRETATIONS OF IBSEN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the recent review of Ibsen's " Brand " in THE 
DIAL there are two statements that to my mind do not 
quite do justice to the work, nor to Ibsen himself. It 
is not always possible for foreigners, even if they are fa- 
miliar with a language, to appreciate its nature thor- 
oughly; and thus it may be permitted me to express a 
different opinion concerning some things stated in the 
review. For example, at the beginning, where the dis- 
tinction is made between authors of poetic form and 
those of poetic thought, Ibsen is classed with the lat- 
ter, and somewhat categorically denied beauty of form. 
Now, to all Norwegians, nay, to all Scandinavians, with- 
out exception, Ibsen is the master of form par excel- 
lence; none of our poets being, as is he, the absolute ar- 
tist that bends and shapes the language into perfect 
rhyme and perfect rhythm alike. Surely he is no Ten- 
nyson; he carries the sword rather than the wreath of 
roses; but his weapon is as finely- wrought and well- 
tempered a blade as any masterpiece of Damascus. 
The question of his superiority of form may safely be 
left with his people, who have long deemed him beyond 
criticism on that point. The English-speaking nations 
naturally have a standard of form of their own, but it 
would be rather unfair to apply this to other languages. 
Besides, the miserable translations in which Ibsen's 
works have suffered in almost every foreign tongue 
have done their utmost to obscure the excellence of his 
style. Those that understand his " Terje Viken " and 
his " Comedy of Love " know better what to think. 
The Norwegian tongue, with its stock of good dialect 
words, is capable, we are proud to say, of expressing 
whatever an artist may choose to confide to it; and Ib- 
sen has been able not only to use it with virtuosity, but 
also to increase even further its capacity of expression. 
But as the tongue is spoken by only two millions of 
people, students of European literature, naturally, do 
not generally take the trouble to learn it; but in order 
to gain some acquaintance with the leading ideas in 
works that have caused such stir as have Ibsen's, they 
turn to translations that are often translated from other 
translations, both alike being misrepresenting and poor. 
Another remark concerning the idea and bearing of 
" Brand." The author justifies his hero less, perhaps, 
than the reader is apt to think. Ibsen is anything but 
dogmatic; his satire is entirely too keen and clear- 
sighted for that, or, as the translator so well puts it, 
" His most definite and dominant thoughts come to the 
surface laden with that tangle of counter-thought which 
gathers about every peremptory conclusion in the depths 
of a critical mind." We wish the reader could always 
keep these lines in mind. Humanity has no heroes to 
Ibsen, unless it be his women ; but there he is probably 
influenced from other sources. The figures are never 
seen with a naive, admiring glance, but rather with a 
searching eye, in order to bring out their whole charac- 



ter, to give us the sense about them, if you will. Neither 
does the poet so absolutely "stand for individualism 
first and last," as the reviewer seems to think; that 
sounds a little too much like celebration of egotism, 
and to this Ibsen is vehemently opposed. His demand is 
much more strictly ideal. He asks for the true man as 
" God saw him in his mind on the day of creation," the 
man with character and yet humble, the man that 
knows his will and is still obedient, the man that has 
learned and broadened his spirit and grown in mind and 
body. Herein is his point of contact with Goethe. That 
he does not remain in this serene tranquillity and men- 
tal elevation that characterizes the teaching of Goethe, 
but wages incessant warfare, is due to the critical fault- 
finding and active idealism of his spirit. In this, per- 
haps, is found the reason of his chief distance from the 
great Olympian father and the source of his own abund- 
ant originality: that where Goethe is always synthetic, 
Ibsen is the born revolutionary and analyst. But to 
return to " Brand." 

The book itself dates from the period of the great 
pietistic movement in Norway, and is in the widest 
sense a poetical-philosophical summary of the interest 
for life of such a wave of strong religious feeling and 
fanaticism as that period witnessed. This great ques- 
tion certainly touched Ibsen's searching mind more than 
any other man's, far and wide. It is with the glaring 
light of his Diogenes' lantern that he reveals the scene 
as it is stereotyped in " Brand." If any moral sentence 
should be the motto of the book, it might be that of 
Goethe : " Licht, mehr Licht I " Broader views, better 
understanding ! Ibsen is here questioning the right and 
value of the spiritual supremacy that some ardent na- 
tures claim (in religious matters) over their fellow- 
beings, and he shows the form such spiritual supremacy 
takes when the mind is powerfully agitated. Brand is 
the type of a leader, a prophet, a spiritual fire, as his 
name indicates, the reformer that will strike down and 
annihilate by the blaze of his wrath the dull and vicious 
vermin that poison the world and infect the pastoral 
herd, and will put up instead a new altar and establish 
a new devotion to God. He means to wake them up 
with his word as well as with his example. He is of 
unflinching belief in his right and his mission, a zealot 
with as narrow a view of Christianity as any of the fa- 
natics fostered in those valleys where the mountains 
crowd out the sky and the hardships of life seem to lie 
in wait for one's very soul. As severe as is existence 
are the views of all those that strive for it. The word 
" sin " covers such a vast field of harmless enjoyment ! 
The minds are shy and bitter, the deadening of the 
flesh is the highest achievement comprehended. The 
most innocent play incites severe reproof how can 
feeling or compassion, warmth of heart and spontaneity, 
but freeze and crystallize in such surroundings ? 

Brand is as erring in his converting frenzy as are 
those that beguile him and finally drive him out beyond 
the boundaries of his parish into the lonely wilderness, 
to perish in the cold and snow. This utter lack of re- 
sponsiveness, the absolute failure of his mission, strikes 
a harder death-blow than his exposure and his un- 
happiness. The doubt, the feeling of inability to un- 
derstand more than one side of the reforming work, 
gnaws on his conscience; he feels overcome, and in the 
anguish of death the cry goes up to heaven whether 
after all, he has not been mistaken, whether the un- 
swerving energy of his man's will shall not be the fea- 
ture that redeems him; and he receives as an answer 
that God is not the God of law but of love. Thus

Brand sinks perishing at the feet of the mercy he has 
not understood, and the snow-storm that has swept 
around him covers him up and extinguishes the last 
sparks of the fire that burned so fervently. 

To translate Ibsen, we may safely say, is by no means 
an easy task. How many efforts have been made in 
earlier times to interpret other masters of thought and 
fiction such as Shakespeare, Byron, and Goethe 
without succeeding in making the authors at home in a 
foreign literature. If Professor Hereford in his ren- 
dering of Ibsen is able to introduce him at his best to 
the American world of readers, the admirers and friends 
of the great poet cannot but be deeply beholden to the 
translator for his noble work. -^ WERGELAND

LOCAL USAGE IN AMERICAN SPEECH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The systematic study of American speech and cus- 
toms is made difficult by the fact that no map has yet 
been made of the centres and currents of diversity of 
usage. In order that this may be done it is necessary 
that as many answers as possible be obtained to a num- 
ber of test questions. Such a list has been prepared 
from questions suggested by members of the Modern 
Language Association of North America. I would call 
the attention of readers of THE DIAL to this list, and 
urge those that have interest in the matter to answer as 
many of the questions as they conveniently can, and for- 
ward the answers to me; or hand the list to some one 
who has the time and inclination to do so. Other in- 
formation than that asked for will be gladly received, 
but would better be written on a separate sheet. It 
may be some time before the results of the investiga- 
tion can be published, but when they are, THE DIAL 
will be notified. What is wanted is a report of natural 
speech, without regard to what dictionaries and teach- 
ers say is " correct." If a word or usage is in vogue 
only among the illiterate, mark it "I"; if only among 
negroes, " N "; if rare, " R." Correspondents will please 
write only on one side of the paper, and number the 
answers as the questions are.

PASQTJIER'S PICTURES OF NAPOLEONIC 
TIMES. * 



Chancellor Pasquier's second volume, cover- 
ing the period (1812-1814) from the French 
advance on Moscow to the first Bourbon res- 
toration, serves on the whole to strengthen the 
favorable impression left by the first. As a 
picture of Napoleonic times it is of special 
value partly in that it is the account of a 
fresh witness and not a mere editorial pouring 
of old wine into new bottles, and partly because 
the witness himself is a rarely competent one. 
As prefect of police under the Consulate and 
the Empire, it was his official duty to keep 
himself informed on public matters and to care- 
fully sift and generalize his information. Po- 
lice business, too, at that time of civil unrest and 
shifting opinion, took on a color strongly polit- 
ical. Briefly, then, we are to regard Pasquier as 
a first-rate authority on the questions handled 
in this volume, and not as the mere quidnunc 
and retailer of the current political chit-chat of 
the period of Napoleon's waning fortunes. 

The narrative opens, as we have said, at the 
outset of the Kussian campaign. The early 
optimistic bulletins from the Grand Army did 
not, says Pasquier, impose on those at Paris 
in a position and a temper to judge coolly of 
the Fabian policy of the Russian commanders. 
The continuous retrograde movement, from 
which many drew the brightest conclusions, 
was rightly viewed by others as the result of 
a system the primary object of which was to 
exhaust the French army by long marches 
through a country in which it had no base of 
supplies, and to draw it away from its stores 
and reinforcements. It was even feared and 
with reason, as the event proved that Napo- 
leon himself would end in sharing the illusions 
he sought to disseminate. His situation was, 
even at the outset when he had most to hope, 
and irrespective of the inherent dangers of a 
Russian campaign, a serious one. The peace 
concluded between Russia and Turkey had re- 
leased a Russian army corps and left it free 
to attack the French in the rear. It was known, 
moreover, that a meeting had taken place at 
Abo between the Emperor of Russia and the 
Prince Royal of Sweden, and that an under-

standing was reached allowing the Russian 
troops to leave their cantonments in Finland 
and march to the rescue of Riga ; to this was 
to be added the diversion likely to be made in 
Pomerania by a Swedish army. Yet in the 
face of it all Napoleon decided, after taking 
Smolensk, not to halt his sorely fatigued troops 
for rest, but to move on to Moscow ! Had he 
halted for the winter on the Diina, he might, 
Pasquier thinks, have organized in his rear the 
old Polish provinces, and have thus placed him- 
self in a position either to dictate a peace or 
begin a decisive campaign in the Spring. The 
apparent infatuation of the Emperor was freely 
censured by his officials at Paris. Said M. 
Decres, the Minister of Marine, after detailing 
the facts just noted : 

" What everybody sees the Emperor does not see, or 
else he is mad enough to cast from him all that seems 
to run counter to his presumptuous hopes. In the mean- 
while Marmont is being beaten in Spain, and, within six 
months, the result of his defeat may be the loss of Spain. 
. . . All this, moreover, has not and will not have any 
effect on him. He will imagine that he can find a way 
out of the difficulty, by making a further demand for 
conscripts; the Senate has just turned over one hundred 
and forty thousand of them to him, which makes four 
hundred and forty thousand for the year; and do you 
think that a rope on which there is such a tension can 
endure for any length of time ? No, I tell you he is a 
lost man." 

Evidently the Napoleonic superstition, like 
the Napoleonic star, had already begun to wane. 
Meanwhile the Emperor pursued his fatal jour- 
ney. On September 7 the battle of the Mos- 
kowa was fought, and a victory was won, which, 
however, at Paris, " struck consternation into 
the hearts of the most steadfast of Napoleon's 
friends, and produced a sort of stupor in the 
public mind." The road to Moscow lay open ; 
but never, in twenty years of stubborn combats, 
had so many generals and officers of note been 
killed or wounded. The substantial fruits of 
victory, moreover, were lost through default. 
All are agreed that the battle of the Moskowa 
was wrongly engaged by the Emperor who 
was, however, it is fair to say, indisposed, and 
consequently obliged to act largely on the ad- 
vice of his generals. Moreover, after the day 
was won, argues Pasquier, by refusing to send 
his guard into action, he failed to complete the 
rout of the Russians and allowed them to or- 
ganize their retreat and to re-form their lines 
without hindrance. "He therefore, through 
his own fault, reduced almost to nothing the 
result of this so eagerly sought for battle." 
The truth is that Napoleon's situation, after 
crossing the Niemen, was such that he had no 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



265 



knowledge whatever of the disposal or numbers 
of the forces opposed to him. He had com- 
pletely lost his reckoning, or was, at least, feel- 
ing his way by the roughest of dead-reckoning. 
Perhaps, like Wallenstein, he trusted to what 
he called his " star " an astronomical or as- 
trological figment whose baleful influence on 
the fortunes of France culminated in 1871. 
The swarms of Cossacks did not permit him 
to extend his reconnoitring beyond a league 
or so, and as the peasantry fled at his approach 
all means of getting information were shut off. 
It is known that he was for two days after the 
battle of Moskowa unable to discover the road 
by which the Russian army was retreating. Is 
it not, then, asks Pasquier, 
" Perfectly just to conclude that his enterprise, con- 
ceived with the greatest rashness, was no less madly ex- 
ecuted, without any settled plan of campaign, without 
any assured means of communication with the rein- 
forcements of which he daily stood in greater need ? 
Pursuing, as he was, an enemy whose strength was un- 
known to him, he was marching on Moscow without be- 
ing able to say what he would do when he reached 
there, seemingly under the impression that everything 
depended on his occupying that capital." 

While thus severely and justly criticising 
Bonaparte's Russian venture, Pasquier does not 
fail to note his returning energy and resource- 
fulness amid the thickening disasters of the re- 
treat. He says : 

"If, on the one hand, no other man but Napoleon 
could have conceived and ventured on so mad an expe- 
dition, on the other he was the only man whom it could 
not crush. So magnetic was the power which he exer- 
cised over the men who perished while following him, 
that not the slightest sign of disobedience manifested 
itself, that not a murmur arose from the ranks of an 
army which was dying of cold and hunger. Such an ex- 
ample has never been set the world, and Napoleon has 
never appeared greater than to those who saw him on 
the banks of the Beresina, walking along those unknown 
shores, stick in hand, absorbed in a study of the chances 
remaining to him of concealing from the enemy the 
crossing of the river by his army, giving his orders with 
undisturbed, unruffled coolness, and finally triumphing 
over a difficulty which would have seemed insurmount- 
able to any other man." 

Napoleon left Moscow in October, 1812, and 
reached Paris on the 18th of December, at mid- 
night. On the following Sunday, at his usual 
levee, says Pasquier, " he approached me most 
affably, and whispered to me so that I alone 
should hear his words : ' And so, JMonsieur le 
' Prefet, you too have had your day of tribula- 
tion ; there is no lack of such in a man's life ! ' 

To explain this allusion of the Emperor's, let 
us a retrace our steps a little. The discontent 
awakened at Paris by the later bulletins from 
the Grand Army naturally inspired the Gov- 



ernment's enemies, of whatever political stripe, 
with the hope of overthrowing it ; and towards 
the end of October a most audacious scheme 
to that end came to the surface. We allude, 
of course, to the famous Malet conspiracy. As 
this episode falls peculiarly within Pasquier's 
competency as a witness, and as he avers, more- 
over, that received accounts of it are more or 
less falsified, it may be worth while to devote 
some space to his version. 

The hero of the plot, General Malet, a rest- 
less spirit whose ardent ("virulent" is Pas- 
quier's word) republicanism neither the woes 
of the Terror nor the glories of the Empire 
could shake, was at the time no longer a young 
man. He began his military career in the 
mousquetaires ; with the Revolution he became 
a zealous patriot^ and he rejoined the army in 
1792 ; in 1799 he was a general de brigade. 
His services were dispensed with in the first 
days of the Empire, when he settled in Paris 
and at once began plotting against the man 
whom he regarded as the assassin of the lib- 
erties of France. Probably, at bottom, Malet 
was one of those chronic malcontents who nat- 
urally constitute the radicals of any given pol- 
ity or arrangement whatsoever provided only 
it exists. As with the newly-arrived Hibernian 
immigrant of the story, the phrase " agin the 
government " might at any time and under any 
conditions have precisely defined his political 
attitude. At any rate, about 1809, the Gen- 
eral's sinister activities landed him in the prison 
of La Force, whence, in 1812, he was trans- 
ferred, through the indulgence of Fouche, who 
owed him a kindness, to a private hospital in 
the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Here he was 
only nominally a prisoner ; escape was easy, 
and there was no obstacle in the way of inter- 
course with the outer world. Naturally, he did 
not neglect his opportunities. On entering the 
hospital he found there several kindred spirits, 
MM. de Polignac, Berthier de Sauvigny, M. 
de Puyvert, and the Abbe Lafon the last of 
whom, only, it is important for us to note. 
As this coterie were held as participants in 
a royalist plot, it will be seen that the General 
and his fellow captives were by no means birds 
of a political feather, the bond between them 
being rather a common hatred than a common 
ideal. The tie, however, sufficed ; a comfort- 
able modus vivendi was established, and things 
went merrily forward. In M. Lafon, Malet 
found a zealous ally one, it is said, who, de- 
spite his cloth and his politics, did not scruple 
to diligently fan the flame of his friend's repub-

lican ardor. About this time, as we have seen, 
events in Eussia were exciting the gravest 
alarm at Paris, and it naturally occured to Ma- 
let that the moment had come to strike. He 
persuaded himself that the downfall of Napo- 
leon might be compassed by a very slight action, 
and it was on the basis of this idea that he laid 
his plans. These were very simple : 

" They consisted in taking advantage of the night to 
make an appearance at the gates of a couple of bar- 
racks, make announcement of the death of Napoleon, 
read out an alleged senatus-consultum repealing the Im- 
perial Government, establishing a provisional govern- 
ment, and investing General Malet with all the powers 
necessary to take command of the armed force, to re- 
quire and command it as he should see fit; to thus get 
for his use a cohorte and one battalion of the regiment; 
to lead and send detachments of these two bodies to 
such points as it was most important to occupy; to em- 
ploy it in arresting public functionaries whose resist- 
ance was most to be feared ; this done, to publish and 
proclaim the spurious senatus-consultum throughout the 
city; call to them the discontented men of whatever 
shade, of whatever party, and assemble at the Hotel 
de Ville the most important among them; form a pro- 
visional government with them, with the aid of which 
they fondly expected to conquer every kind of opposi- 
tion and win the obedience and assent of all France." 

Such were in their entirety the operations to 
be carried out by General Malet and M. Lafon 
after leaving the hospital at eight o'clock on 
the night of October 23. The scheme (" an. 
act of madness," Pasquier calls it) had, of 
course, a hundred inherent difficulties ; and 
there was one very patent obstacle which alone 
should have given the conspirators pause. This 
was the presence, in the environs of Paris and 
within easy call, of some 5,000 troops of the 
Imperial Guard a corps devoted to the Em- 
peror, the Empress, and the King of Rome. 
Malet should have known, moreover, that the 
Guard was not subject to orders he proposed 
to have sent from staff headquarters. 

When the plot burst there remained in the 
hospital only Malet, Lafon, and de Puyvert, 
the last of whom took no part whatever in its 
execution. Its responsibility, therefore, falls 
entirely upon the General and the Abbe, the 
latter's assertion that he had many correspond- 
ents and that extensive preparations had been 
made for a rising being formally disproved by 
our author. In a word, surprise, bewilderment, 
was to be the order of the day, the conspirators 
trusting that in the political chaos following 
the news of Napoleon's death, their own swift, 
concerted, and definite action would effect the 
ends they desired. They found no difficulty 
in leaving the hospital on the evening named, 
and proceeded at once to a room in the Rue 



Saint-Gilles, where they found two confederates 
awaiting them, Boutreux, a young advocate of 
Angers, and Rateau, corporal in the 1st bat- 
talion of the Paris garde, who brought the 
watchword. These two men, says Pasquier, 
together with a Spanish priest who occupied 
the room where the meeting was held, " are the 
only persons who are clearly known to have 
been entrusted in advance with the secret of 
the conspiracy." The business of drawing up 
the spurious documents was at once begun. 
These were the senatus-consultum, the procla- 
mation, an order of the day signed by Malet, 
and two letters of instruction as to the distri- 
bution and duties of the troops, the one ad- 
dressed to M. Soulier, commanding the 10th 
cohorte, the other to M. Rouff, commanding 
the 2d battalion of the garde de Paris. These 
papers were not only faulty in point of form, 
but they provided for a regime which was, to 
say the least, extraordinary. The senatus-con- 
sultum, on the one hand, named as members of 
the provisional government men known for 
their royalist and anti - revolutionary senti- 
ments ; while the order of the day handed over 
the army to Generals Guidal, Desnoyers, and 
Pailhardy, all pronounced revolutionaries, and 
it appointed to the command of a central Paris- 
ian force General Lecourbe, a violent Jacobin, 
and a personal enemy of Napoleon. Plainly, 
the astute Abbe was the author of the senatus- 
consultum, and General Malet of the order of 
the day. The greater part of the night was 
spent over these sufficiently clumsy writings, 
and it was half - past three when Malet, with 
Rateau, reached the Popincourt barracks, the 
quarters of the 10th cohorte. Soulier, the com- 
mander, was ill with fever. 

" The announcement of the Emperor's death, super- 
added to his sickness, upset his faculty of reasoning; he 
believed without hesitation and without verification all 
that was told him, and gave orders that the senatus- 
consultum and the proclamation should be read to the 
troops, which he then placed at the general's disposal." 

A like success awaiting Malet at the Min- 
imes barracks, he presently had at his disposal 
about 1200 soldiers. To direct and handle 
these soldiers resolute and experienced men 
were required, and our hero at once set about 
getting them, with an energy and a fertility of 
resource worthy of the great Emperor himself. 
In the prison of La Force were two political 
captives, Generals Lahorie and Guidal, who, 
once at liberty, could undoubtedly be relied 
upon for cooperation ; and Malet at once re- 
solved to secure them. 

" In their case, also, he made use of the senatus-con-

sultum, and he confirmed to them the news of the Em- 
peror's death, successful in this as in his previous un- 
dertakings. ... It was half-past six o'clock when he 
made his appearance at La Force, followed by a section 
of the cohorte the remainder had gone to occupy the 
Hotel de Ville. The doorkeeper of the jail, seeing a 
body of soldiers, in good order, and commanded by a 
general in uniform, had no doubt that he was acting 
lawfully, and hastened to obey him." 

Lahorie and Guidal were accordingly at once 
released, and the former received orders to pro- 
ceed, with a squad of soldiers, to the Prefec- 
ture de Police, and to arrest the prefect (M. 
Pasquier), installing in his place Boutreux, who 
accompanied him. This disposed of, he was to 
arrest the Due de Rovigo, the Minister of War, 
and himself assume his functions. As to Malet, 
he took with him 150 men, and proceeded to 
the military headquarters in the Place Ven- 
dome, whither we shall follow him presently. 
It was past seven o'clock when Lahorie reached 
the Prefecture de Police. Says Pasquier : 

" I had just arisen from my bed, when I heard con- 
siderable noise coming from the rooms leading to my 
bedroom. My valet left me to ascertain the cause of 
all this commotion. On finding himself in the presence 
of soldiery, he tried to stop its further progress, and 
barred the way to my door, displaying in so doing re- 
markable devotion ; he was thrust aside, and received a 
bayonet wound in the leg. I was attempting to reach 
the stairway leading to the garden, when I was assailed 
by a baud of soldiers, led by an officer, who forced me 
to return to my bedroom, while forbidding his men to 
lay violent hands on me. This officer, whom I did not 
recognize, wore a mantle ; his characteristic feature, his 
incipient baldness, was concealed by a large hat. It 
was General Lahorie. He informed me of the death of 
the Emperor, killed under the walls of Moscow, and 
notified me of the alleged senatus-consultum, which he, 
however, did not let me read. He likewise told me that 
the citizen Boutreux was going to assume my functions, 
and then made me a prisoner in my own room, placing 
a couple of soldiers on guard over me." 

From the Prefecture Lahorie hastened to 
the Ministry of Police. Here a far more 
exciting scene was enacted, which, however, 
need not be detailed here. Suffice it to say 
that the Due de Rovigo was arrested and hur- 
ried away to La Force by General Guidal, an 
inveterate personal enemy, who was only re- 
strained by his superior from obeying to the 
letter Malet's order " to have recourse to the 
most violent methods." Lahorie, who signed 
the commitment, had at once usurped the min- 
ister's functions, with the object, as he sub- 
sequently declared at his own trial, of saving 
Rovigo's life. This assertion, says Pasquier, 
"Is not consonant with truth, for immediately upon 
being installed in the official residence, he sent for a 
tailor, of whom he ordered the habit of a minister; he 
then entered the carriage of his predecessor, and had 



himself driven to the Hotel de Ville where he presented 
himself as Minister of Police." 

Meanwhile, Pasquier, still under guard in his 
bedroom, had prevailed on the unwary Bou- 
treux to show him the senatus-consultum and 
the proclamation. A glance confirmed his sus- 
picions that both were apochryphal. He was 
still pondering over the probable outcome of 
this mad enterprise, when a sub-lieutenant of 
the cohorte, one Lefevre, entered the room with 
an order for his commitment to La Force, 
whither he was at once conveyed. Arrived at 
the prison, he was handed over to Lebeau, the 
jailor a worthy man, who, says Pasquier, 
" owed his situation to me." " As soon as the 
doors were closed behind me," he adds, " he 
placed himself at my disposal." From Lebeau 
Pasquier learned the events of the early morn, 
when Lahorie and Guidal had been freed, and 
also that the Due de Rovigo and M. Des- 
marets had just been registered as prisoners. 
Obviously, in La Force, the Prefect was as lit- 
tle under duress as were the General and the 
Abbe in the sanitarium of Saint- Antoine ; and 
he was about " escaping " with the kindly 
connivance of Mme. Lebeau by a side en- 
trance, when M. Saulnier, the Due de Rovigo's 
secretary, and M. Laborde, the town adjutant, 
arrived with the news that all was over, and 
that Generals Malet and Lahorie were under 
arrest. 

The following is what hastened the issue: 
On reaching the Place Vendome, Malet pro- 
ceeded to the house of General Hulin, com- 
mander of the military division. Leaving his 
troop at the door, he mounted to the General's 
room, accompanied by two or three of his offi- 
cers. Here he informed Hulin of the Empe- 
ror's death ; but noting, as he thought, a cloud 
of disbelief on his face, he bade him step into 
an adjoining room to look over the vouchers. 
The luckless Hulin acquiesced ; and no sooner 
had the door closed behind them than Malet 
shot him dead with a pistol thus indicating 
the degree of " violence " he expected from his 
lieutenants. Having perpetrated this crime, 
Malet hurried back to his command. By this 
time, as may be supposed, it had been noticed 
that something wrong was passing at General 
Hulin's, and an alarm was raised. Still, Malet 
managed to gain admission to General Doucet, 
chief of the staff, who was at the time reading 
the senatus-consultum just handed him. Dou- 
cet had detected the forgery, and was protest- 
ing against the imposture. Noting this, the 
now desperate Malet drew his pistol, and was 



268 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



about to dispose of Doucet as he had already 
disposed of Hulin, when Adjutant Laborde 
promptly disarmed him and placed him under 
arrest, and then summoned to his aid the troops 
that guarded the residence. The soldiers of 
the cohorte, however, on learning what had hap- 
pened, at once surrendered to Laborde and Gen- 
eral Doucet. Thus, all was over with General 
Malet, after a rather amazing success of four 
or five hours' duration. 

Pasquier goes rather fully into the subse- 
quent trials especially that of Lahorie, whose 
case was a singularly hard one. It is pretty 
evident that he was completely deceived. As for 
Malet himself, it is due to his memory to say 
that he did not hesitate, at his trial, to assume 
entire responsibility for the foolhardy enter- 
prise, expressly exonerating his companions, 
and revealing thereby the strain of nobility in 
his character. As with so many Frenchmen 
of that time, his political ideal inspired him 
with the fervor and fanaticism of a religious 
belief ; and he died for it cheerfully. It is some- 
thing of a satisfaction to know that he died a 
soldier's death by the bullet. He summed 
up his cause in these few words : " The man 
who has constituted himself the defender of his 
country has no need of any defence ; he tri- 
umphs, or goes to his death." 

Malet, Lahorie, Guidal, Boccheiampe, Sou- 
lier, and eight officers, were sentenced to death, 
and shot the next morning on the plain of 
Grenelle. " And I am of opinion," says Pas- 
quier mildly, "that a lesser number might have 
been brought to trial, and that fewer lives 
might have been sacrificed." As Malet was 
probably the only victim (except Boutreux) 
who was actually guilty of the charge laid, the 
Prefect's " opinion " seems not unreasonable. 

It remains to account for M. Lafon the 
good Abbe who discreetly vanished when the 
waves ran high. He was diligently hunted, 
as it was known that if the Royalist party had 
countenanced the conspiracy, the threads of it 
could only be grasped by securing him. All 
efforts proved unavailing, however ; and M. 
Lafon, it seems, busied himself thenceforth in 
dodging from one hiding-place to another (do- 
ing, meanwhile, as much mischief as was com- 
patible with his personal safety), until the Res- 
toration enabled him to float serenely to the 
surface. 

Chancellor Pasquier has supplementally 
styled his Memoir " A History of My Time," 
thus forestalling a possible stricture that he 
has, in composing it, unduly subordinated biog- 



raphy to history. Throughout the work there is 
an abundance of historical and political narra- 
tive, with the sagacious, well-weighed views and 
judgments of Pasquier the statesman ; but there 
is relatively little that might serve to bring us 
closer to Pasquier the man. The book is richer 
in political reflection and criticism than in per- 
sonalia and anecdote though the latter ele- 
ments are not absent. Of humor we discover 
no trace. The Chancellor's story flows on with 
the dignity and philosophic calm at times 
with a degree of the penetration of a De 
Tocqueville ; and one notes throughout a cer- 
tain stateliness of phrase, a balance of period, 
and an elimination of color and detail, trace- 
able, perhaps, to the classicist standards of the 
writer's earlier years. Closing with the depart- 
ure of the Allies from Paris, the volume covers 
an eventful period a time of shifting political 
fortunes, of fateful struggles on the field and 
in the cabinet. Pasquier treats of these matters 
with a largeness of view and a precision of 
knowledge that will commend his work to all 
serious students of the Napoleonic era. The 
good work of the translator, Mr. Charles E. 
Roche, calls for a word of praise. E G j 



AN INDEX-GUIDE TO VENETIAN 
PAINTERS. * 

Few things are more irritating to the aver- 
age man than to be told his taste in pictures is 
bad. In the matter of books, he has probably 
acquired habits of submission at an early age ; 
but in most cases he is first seriously introduced 
to pictures when of mature years. He is jeal- 
ous of his personal rights ; he refuses to be dic- 
tated to by self -constituted connoisseurs; but he 
generally ends by quietly acquiescing in their 
judgments and by reverently if unintelligently 
prostrating himself before each and every can- 
vas that may happen to be called after the ortho- 
dox masters. This is as it should be, because 
untrained instinct is just as likely to miss in 
pictures as in books or in life, and half -trained 
instinct is sure to miss. But there are diffi- 
culties in the way of the neophyte in the gal- 
leries of Europe, especially of Italy. He sees 
the name of, say, Leonardo da Vinci in his cat- 
alogue or on the frame before him. In his new 
submissiveness he straightway worships a 
much-rubbed copy by a pupil of a picture by 
a pupil of Leonardo. Italy is full of these

false painted idols. How they came to be 
by the unscrupulous vanity of picture fanciers, 
by sheer carelessness, by honestly stupid attri- 
bution, this does not concern us here. 
Enough that they exist, and are a trap for the 
unwary. Existing in such numbers, moreover, 
these lying attributions have of late years 
piqued connoisseurship to finer and more exact 
methods, which, aided by the growth of rapid 
transit and the perfection of isochromatic pho- 
tography, are now capable of practically certain 
conclusions. Such up-to-date attributions are 
to be found in Mr. Berenson's account of " The 
Venetian Painters of the Renaissance," which 
is among the very first fruits in English of the 
new art criticism. With Mr. Berenson's In- 
dexes in hand, the student and the traveller 
may feel reasonably confident of worshipping, 
at least among Venetian masters, no false or 
unknown gods. He will find two catalogue- 
indexes : one to the works of the principal Ven- 
etian painters in the public galleries, private 
collections, and churches of Europe ; the other 
to the various places in Europe containing 
these works. 

But the serious lay-student needs fuller in- 
struction yet. He may stand before the right 
picture in the wrong mood. It is true that 
most people will object most strenuously against 
having their moods cut out for them. Titian, 
they will say, has not the same message for 
everyone ; everyone has a right to his own par- 
ticular reading of the master. Now we believe 
this much-flaunted relativity of tastes to be 
wrong. If painting is to give higher pleasure 
than cooking, it must appeal to our intelligence 
as well as to our senses. And it can only do 
so by conveying some sort of meaning. Now 
Titian's meaning, being expressed in a definite 
and peculiar picture-language, is not open to the 
chance comer any more than the meaning of a 
Parisian is open to a German who has never 
learned French. Indeed, the picture-language 
of Titian is even more difficult to the unin- 
structed than the sound-language of the Paris- 
ian. To translate the former for ourselves we 
must have acquainted ourselves with the nature 
and limits of picture-language in general and 
of Titian's picture-language in particular ; we 
must know if and how far the religious and 
political prejudices of his time allowed him to 
paint his meaning as clearly and plainly as the 
medium permitted ; in fine, we must slowly and 
at many pains learn numerous things of which 
the chance comer has no conception whatso- 
ever. The sensible student, therefore, will stoop 



to conquer, will prefer being right to being 
original. Now to say, indeed, that Mr. Beren- 
son's luminous and condensed translation of 
the picture-language of Venetian painters is in 
all respects right, would be to assume for our- 
selves a finality even greater. His interpreta- 
tions are at least plausible and suggestive, and 
the historical nexus of which they form links 
is clearly and graphically presented. 

It would be unjust to his own disclaimer to 
attempt to crowd the progress of Venetian art 
into any single formula ; but very roughly 
speaking, Venetian painters may be said in the 
first place to have been formed under the tute- 
lage of the Church, then later to have passed 
through the stage of the patronage of the city 
to the final independence of the schools. And 
still more roughly, the three stages may be typ- 
ified by the JPieta, the Pageant, and the Por- 
trait. But we are indulging in generalizations 
for which the soberer study before us hardly 
gives warrant. 

The make-up of the book is tasteful outside 
and in, from the pretty Venetian binding to 
the frontispiece, a reproduction of Giorgione's 
fascinating " Shepherd with Pipe." Some hesi- 
tation may be felt as to the primer-like method 
of paragraphing with numerals in bold type ; 
this device undoubtedly facilitates reference, 
but it breaks continuity of attention and spoils 
the page. In so short a book the device hardly 
seems necessary.

CHAPTERS or AFRICAN DISCOVERT.* 

Lieutenant von Hbhnell's book of travels in 
Africa is one of the most important contribu- 
tions to our knowledge of that country that has 
been published in many a year ; and had it ap- 
peared three years ago, when African explor- 
ers were the rage of the day, would have made a 
marked sensation. It possesses every qualifica- 
tion to insure to it a positive success and perma- 
nent value. It is written in a dignified and inter- 
esting narrative style, without any of the cheap 
and ejaculative dialogues that disfigure Stan- 
ley's books ; with no pretense at literary art, but 
with the impressiveness of intelligent simplicity 
and directness. The line of travel of the two 
explorers Count Teleki, a Transylvanian no-

bleman, and Lieut, von Hbhnell, who is the chief 
narrator was, in the earlier stages, the famil- 
iar one of Livingstone and Stanley inland from 
Mombasa in Zanzibar, the oldest mission sta- 
tion in eastern Africa. Instead of going west- 
ward to Victoria Nyanza, they turned north- 
ward through the mountain regions, which they 
thoroughly explored ; through the wild and 
uncultivated Masailand, and the shunned and 
dreaded Kikuyaland ; discovering new volca- 
noes, and discovering and thoroughly investi- 
gating two great lakes which they named for 
the Crown Prince and Princess of Austria, Ru- 
dolf and Stefanie. Lake Rudolf is about one- 
third the size of the Victoria Nyanza. 

The trickiness, greediness, quarrelsomeness, 
and elusiveness of the Africans, the rebuffs, 
disappointments, and obstacles so trying to 
the patience of other African explorers, were 
promptly encountered by these travellers ; and 
the Lieutenant says, "We soon gave up the idea 
that we could wander around Africa in a light- 
hearted, careless way." Indeed, the parapher- 
nalia of an African trip would prohibit any 
thought of care-free days. These two sports- 
men started from Zanzibar with two hundred 
Zanzibari, nine guides, nine guards, and four 
hundred and fifty porters, and a vast number of 
cattle and donkeys. The food for such a regi- 
ment of men would be no light burden or consid- 
eration, the wages no small sum. The list of the 
arms and ammunition is in itself astonishing. 

It is with a pleasant sense of renewal of old 
acquaintance that we find in the early pages of 
this work, among the newly engaged guides 
and escorts, the names of various dusky natives 
of varying reliability who served with Stanley, 
Thomson, Junker, the unfortunate Bishop Han- 
nington, and other travellers ; and we even note 
that itinerant culinary treasure, Speke's and 
Cameron's cook, Mhogo. 

Among the most thrilling pages are those 
which tell of the ascent of Mt. Kilimanjaro, 
Mt. Kenia, Mt. Kibo. Those of us who are 
familiar with the old missionary accounts of 
Africa will remember that these mountains 
were discovered about the middle of this cen- 
tury by missionaries of the Church Missionary 
Society of London, and that the story told by 
those pious gentlemen, of snow-capped peaks 
so close to the equator, was universally discred- 
ited. Not recalling that these missionaries trav- 
elled with any extraordinary outfit or attend- 
ance, 1 have searched for and re-read their story, 
and find that the journey to the mountains, 
which required seven hundred followers in 



1886, was made by Parson Rebman in 1848 
with nine men and " weaponed only with an 
umbrella." 

Lieutenant von Hbhnell's description of the 
primeval forests found on these mountains, for- 
ests which no' man could penetrate save through 
paths trodden by the mighty elephants ; of 
the giant trees, dead through their burden of 
strange, weird, clinging parasites and lurid- 
flowered creepers ; with the painful stillness, 
unbroken by cry of bird or beast or hum of 
insect, where even at midday, under a tropical 
sun, a chill, gloomy, greenish twilight pre- 
vailed, this forceful story makes us compre- 
hend and almost feel the welcome which our 
travellers gave in the higher grass-belt to a 
cheerful, homely, well-known face that of our 
common violet. 

The description of the happy life in Taveta 
that orderly, prosperous African Arcadia 
confirms Joseph Thomson's account in his 
" Through Masailand." We can but wonder 
that some Aryan race has not ere now chosen 
and invaded that highly blessed and charming 
spot, and there founded a colony ; though this 
would never seem feasible while there still ex- 
ists in eastern Africa the slave-trade, and no 
means of transport from the coast save by hu- 
man carriers. 

These travellers cannot boast, as does Dr. 
Johnston in his recent book of African travel, 
that they did not lose a follower by death. 
Scores fell by the wayside, were lost or drowned, 
or died of fever. All endured great privations, 
horrible thirst, sicknesses, and dangers, and 
were in waterless Samburu in very desperate 
straits. So gaunt was Count Teleki, a power- 
ful giant whose normal weight was two hundred 
and thirty-eight pounds, that he weighed but 
a hundred and forty pounds. 

One of the objects of the expedition was the 
pursuit of big game, as well as " heroic ardour 
to adventurous deeds," and in that end it was 
signally successful. Many of the records of 
the hunts are most spirited and thrilling. I 
have had curiosity enough to make a summary 
of the game shot by Count Teleki from Feb- 
ruary 18 to September 28, and find he bagged 
seventy-nine rhinoceroses, three hippopotami, 
thirty-eight elephants, one giraffe, two lions, 
one panther, one wildcat, one leopard, and a 
vast number of buffalo, antelope, zebras, harte- 
bestes, and other variety of deer. The infre- 
quency of the slaughter of or encounter with 
members of the feline tribe is notable, and con- 
firms the reports of recent African travellers

(except of Mr. Selous in Mashon aland) that 
the African lion and his congeners are fast be- 
coming as extinct as the sabre-toothed tiger of 
the Drift in western Europe. 

Lieutenant von Hb'hnell does not appear to 
have been so successful a shot as his compan- 
ion, and the records of wounded and maimed 
brutes that escaped death or capture are pain- 
fully frequent to an unsportsmanlike and bes- 
tiarian sensibility. Such accounts as this are 
interesting, probably, to a hunter : 

" A great yellowish-brown creature suddenly came in 
sight at a distance of eighty paces. It was a giraffe ; but I 
was so taken by surprise at seeing it so near me and far 
from the steppes these shy creatures generally haunt, that 
I could not at first believe my eyes. I crept cautiously 
nearer so as to get a good view of the body and choose the 
best point at which to aim. The giraffe, a splendid full- 
grown male, did not budge, but went on feeding on the 
tender topmost leaves on an acacia, without the slightest 
suspicion of danger. All the hunter's zeal laid to rest 
among the quantities of game awoke within me again, 
and as I approached I spied a second smaller giraffe, 
and realized that the two were a pair who had with- 
drawn together to the forest. After long consideration 
as to where the heart might be in a body of a form so 
unfamiliar to me, I fired. The buck was wounded to 
death ; and as he struggled in his last agonies, he turned 
slowly towards his wife, who stood rooted to the spot, 
Jier great gazelle-like eyes fixed on her mate. The 
hunting fever once roused, I had lost all mercy, and I 
did not hesitate to fire at the female. Though both now 
were mortally wounded, the two remained standing, 
with their forelegs stuck out in front of them; so I put 
a rapid end to their sufferings by firing again. The lit- 
tle wife was the first to die ; she fell forwards, and then 
wound her long neck over on the left till her head al- 
most touched her tail. I did not actually see the buck 
die, as I was watching the passing away of his mate. 
... I am sorry now I did not measure the male. The 
size of wild giraffes is ever so much greater than one 
would imagine from seeing them in zoological gardens 
only, and the largest elephant I saw did not impress me 
as half so imposing as a half-grown giraffe. The flesh 
tastes not unlike venison. The skin is nearly as thick 
as that of buffalo, and tremendously tough. ... I also 
came upon another pair of giraffes which gazed upon me 
inquisitively and made no effort to escape. Though 
there was really no need to secure any more meat, I 
could not refrain from firing at the male. Mortally 
wounded, he tried to save himself from falling by stand- 
ing with forelegs wide apart whilst he swayed his long 
neck to and fro. A second shot brought him down. 
His wife ran off at the first shot for scarcely two hun- 
dred paces, and then remained standing, gazing sadly 
at her mate, not even moving away when we busied our- 
selves about his corpse." 

It is with a certain sense of retributive justice 
that we read the record of the Lieutenant's first 
elephant hunt, where he was successful in bring- 
ing down other game. 

"I raised the heavy gun and fired at the shoulder 
near the edge of the huge unwieldly ear. At the same 
moment I got a tremendous blow in the face, and saw 



blood streaming down on the still smoking gun. . . . 
The wounded elephant approached a step nearer and 
was apparently about to charge. There he stood, drawn 
up to his full height, so that he looked enormously tall 
and thin, his ears outspread, and his trunk, which he 
wound in serpentine coils, threateningly uplifted. On 
either side of him, shoulder to shoulder, stood two of 
his comrades, also with outspread ears and uplifted 
trunks, whilst behind him loomed the fourth. Motion- 
less the four remained, sniffing the air and peering to- 
ward our acacia, the silence only broken by the drip- 
ping down of my blood. I had been almost stunned by 
the blow on my face, and my mad zeal for hunting was 
gone, and I felt incapable of firing another shot how- 
ever necessary in my own defence. Presently the ele- 
phants all turned tail and dashed off, the noise of crack- 
ing branches gradually dying away. I now discovered 
that my nose was split nearly open, the right nostril 
hanging loose. The bands of the elephant-gun have a 
strong tendency to fly up in firing. The sharp-edged 
comb of the left hammer had slit up one nostril, and 
cut the bridge of my nose. I bound up my nose as well 
as I could, noted the direction of the elephants' spoor, 
and returned to camp in the dark. Count Teleki did 
not let me go till my face was done up in a regu- 
lar mask as stiff as plaster of Paris. The wound was 
not painful, but it was six weeks before it healed. A 
small scar and a numbness of the tip of the nose still 
remind me of my first elephant hunt." 

It is impossible to overpraise the variety and 
exactness of the information given in this work, 
nor the lucidity and conciseness of its expres- 
sion. With these volumes in hand, one could 
purchase the exact stock necessary for travel 
in eastern Equatorial Africa ; could know what 
to select for trading purposes, what to employ 
to facilitate progress through the various states. 
We are shown the best methods of packing 
these wares ; the best food for the journey, and 
the proper proportions of food. Though the ex- 
pedition was not formed with scientific intent, 
its scientific results were eminently satisfactory. 
Ethnological, ethnographical, and sociological 
questions receive due attention throughout the 
pages, and show careful, unbiased, and unim- 
aginative investigation. The geological and 
petographical results were important, and have 
been recorded in the Imperial Academy of 
Sciences at Vienna. The orological surveys 
were of exceptional value. The entomological 
and botanical lists given in the appendix are 
attractive, and reveal many hitherto unknown 
species and varieties ; indeed, one of the most 
charming characteristics of the book is the love 
of nature shown in the constant description of 
flowers and trees. The vigilant eyes of the trav- 
ellers, and what La Bruyere called the spirit of 
discernment, noted every detail of natural phe- 
nomena with the same intent love that Emin 
Pasha bestowed on like subjects, and that Stan- 
ley so constantly derided.

Large and strongly- affixed maps, showing 
ethnological, geographical, geological, and other 
statistical data ; a glossary of native words and 
phrases, and an exceptionally good index, make 
perfect the book. As a piece of book-making 
it can scarcely be surpassed, not only in its or- 
derliness and good literary proportions, but in 
its mechanical attributes. I have not noted in 
the eight hundred pages a single typographical 
error ; paper and print are alike perfect. The 
illustrations, chiefly taken from photographs, 
are profuse in number, equally interesting and 
varied, and (of the native men and women) 
are hideous and startling enough to satisfy the 
most crying demands for novelty. Weapons, 
costumes, headgear, and ornaments are liberally 
portrayed. The grotesque presentments of the 
latter would have proved invaluable to Mme. 
Cocheris for her new book, " Les Parures Prim- 
itives." 

On closing the book we are impressed that 
there is scarcely any attribute a successful Afri- 
can explorer does not need, for all seem abso- 
lutely imperative : health, wealth, patience, 
courage, endurance, craft, enthusiasm, asceti- 
cism, handiness at every trade and calling, 
but, above all, energy. Emerson says : " This 
world belongs to the energetic." Certainly 
Africa does. ALICE MORSE EARLE. 



RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY.* 



Mr. Fenollosa's "East and West" consists of 
two long and very ambitious poems, and a number 
of minor pieces. The titular poem is a sort of ver- 
sified Culturgeschichte, philosophical and mystical, 
in spirit not unlike Mr. Block's " El Nuevo Mundo," 
which we reviewed a year or so ago. In this poem, 
says the author, "I have endeavored to condense 
my experiences of two hemispheres, and my study 
of their history." The poem is in five parts. The 
first considers the early meeting of East and West,

brought about by the conquests of Alexander. Then 
follow " The Separated East" and "The Separated 
West," themes of which the author has conceived 
in the following terms : " Eastern culture, slowly 
elaborated, has held to ideals whose refinement seems 
markedly feminine. For it social institutions are 
the positive harmonies of a life of brotherhood. 
Western culture, on the contrary, has held to ideals 
whose strength seems markedly masculine. For it 
law is the compromise of Liberty with her own ex- 
cesses, while conquest, science, and industry are but 
parallel channels for the overflow of hungry person- 
ality. But this one-sidedness has been partly com- 
pensated by the religious life of each. The vio- 
lence of the West has been softened by the feminine 
faith of love, renunciation, obedience, salvation from 
without. It is the very impersonality of her great 
ecclesiastical institute which offers to man a refuge 
from self. On the other hand, the peaceful impo- 
tence of the East has been spurred by her martial 
faith of spiritual knighthood, self-reliance, salvation 
from within. The intense individuality of her eso- 
teric discipline upholds the fertile tranquillity of her 
surface. This stupendous double antithesis seems 
to me the most significant fact in all history. The 
future union of the types may thus be symbolized 
as a twofold marriage." In " The Present Meeting 
of East and West," the author deals with " the first 
attempts to assimilate alien ideals," which " have 
led to the irony of a quadruple confusion, analogous 
to the disruption of Alexander's conquest." But 
there is to be another and more intimate union, 
brought about in some mysterious way by the art 
of music, and in a manner foreshadowed in some 
sort by the compositions of Herr Brahms. Here, 
we must confess, we are unable to follow the argu- 
ment. And the poem ends with a rapturous song 
of "The Future Union of East and West." This is 
a good deal of philosophical machinery with which 
to burden a composition of fifteen hundred lines, 
and the work is too ambitious to be wholly success- 
ful. But it abounds in strong passages, such as the 
finely imaginative struggle of the archangels, who 

" Met as mountains meet, when Titans cast 
Pelion on Ossa, and their fragments spurt 
Through startled space a jet of asteroids," 

or the stanzas to Hangchow, where (among other 
things), 

" In a tangle of leaves with silken sleeves 
Thy poets sing on the terraced beach, 
Where the blue-flagged taverns with mossy eaves 
Are starred by the pink of the blossoming peach," 

or the following fine epitome of the Viking con- 
quests : 

"Now shot from polar coasts see meteors flash, 
Long lines of Viking ships, with low black hulls 
Like vultures, plunging through the Northern seas, 
Hovering like gulls in track of channel storms, 
Scouring for prey the long white sunlit cliffs ; 
Wailing their chant to Odin like wild winds 
Surging through organ pipes of naked fjords, 
Wooing Valhalla to Northumbrian hills 
Or primrose-garnished banks of lovely Seine. 
Now, drunk with richer wine of vanquished worlds,

Wielding the cross as once their bolt of Thor, 

They skirt with gorgeous sweep Hispania's curves, 

Through pillared gateway of the land-locked sea 

Set in its rifted coasts of gilded cloud, 

A blue enamelled dragon ! Now they break, 

Those strange Norse champions of a Hebrew god, 

The threatening onsets of the Saracen, 

Dispersed like storms which strew with wrecks thy coast, 

Nurse of a hundred races, Sicily ! " 

We should like to quote also the fine description of 
the destruction of the Summer Palace in 1859, but 
Mr. Fenollosa's other poems claim our remaining 
space. Of these, the most important is " The Dis- 
covery of America," described as " a symphonic 
poem," in four movements, and in a great variety 
of metres. Since both the manner and the matter 
of the author constantly invite musical comparisons, 
we will remark that the suggestion of Liszt is here 
very evident. A passage from the soliloquy of Co- 
lumbus may be reproduced : 

"And yet I knew ; and yet I dimly guessed 

When as a guileless boy 

I climbed the steep Ligurian cliffs in lusty joy, 
And gazed far off upon the dimpled breast 
Of blue-eyed seas that slumbered in the West. 
For was I not compelled 
As by a great hand held 
To gaze, and gaze, and gaze 
Through tender brooding miles of purple haze, 

Till soft-winged isles 
Seemed lifting orange bosoms to the sun's last smiles, 

And my light will, a feather free, 
Was blown like a trembling bird far out to sea 
By storm-winds, Alpine-brewed, of passionate prophecy? " 

The poem from which this extract is taken must 
certainly be reckoned among the most notable in- 
spired by the recent quadri-centennial year. As for 
Mr. Fenollosa's minor poems, they are always in- 
teresting, and often satisfying. We will end our 
examples with the lines to " Fuji at Sunrise " : 

" Startling the cool gray depths of morning air 
She throws aside her counterpane of clouds, 
And stands half folded in her silken shrouds 

With calm white breast and snowy shoulder bare. 

High o'er her head a flush all pink and rare 

Thrills her with foregleam of an unknown bliss, 
A virgin pure who waits the bridal kiss, 

Faint with expectant joy she fears to share. 

Lo, now he comes, the dazzling prince of day ! 
Flings his full glory o'er her radiant breast ; 
Enfolds her to the rapture of his rest, 

Transfigured in the throbbing of his ray. 

fly, my soul, where love's warm transports are ; 

And seek eternal bliss in yon pink kindling star." 

Lest this review would seem to have abrogated the 
traditional fault-finding function of criticism, we 
will close by remarking the false quantity in the 
author's use of " Granicus." But this defect is at 
least partly atoned for by his getting " Himalya " 
right, which few succeed in doing. 

A rather striking imagination, expended impar- 
tially upon the most disparate themes Semitic, 
Greek, and mediaeval coupled with some com- 
mand of dramatic effect, appears in Mr. Hay's 
"Created Gold." We quote the sonnet on "Joan 
of Arc": 



" Patient and passionless Joan led her flock. 

When, visioned dimly, bleeding France appeared, 
Circled with ruined homes and fields war-seared. 
It made her life one plan ; her pity, rock. 
She snatched a sword : France rose 'mid England's mock ; 
Joan drove the foe like sheep, their fleeces sheared. 
With fleur-de-lis in maiden hand upreared, 
She chased and routed Britain, shock on shock. 
France crowned her, ' Bravest Virgin 'neath the sun,' 
And then betrayed to England's baffled host 

That Maid whose form is skyed till time shall cease. 
Joan, great in triumph, greater was undone : 
France gave her much, harsh England gave her most ; 
Three royal gifts Fame, Martyrdom, and Peace." 

A noticeable lack of finish frequently lessens the 
acceptability of Mr. Hay's poems, excellent though 
the stuff with which they deal. 

A contemplative philosophy, the gentle melan- 
choly of the soul that has borne disillusion with little 
of the shock that it has for a more passionate natui e, 
and a semi-religious sentiment tending towards qui- 
etism, seem the characteristic notes of Mr. George 
Santayana's sonnets. The restf ulness of their effect, 
and the placid flow of their thought, may be well 
felt in this example: 

" A wall, a wall around nay garden rear, 
And hedge me in from the disconsolate hills ; 
Give me but one of all the mountain rills, 
Enough of ocean in its voice I hear. 
Come no profane insatiate mortal near 
With the contagion of his passionate ills ; 
The smoke of battle all the valleys fills, 
Let the eternal sunlight greet me here. 
This spot is sacred to the deeper soul 
And to the piety that mocks no more. 
In nature's inmost heart is no uproar, 
None in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll, 
In peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore, 
And ancient quiet broods from pole to pole." 

A group of Sapphic odes, metrically less happy 
than in expression, follows the sonnets in Mr. San- 
tayana's volume, and these are in turn followed by a 
few miscellaneous and occasional pieces. " Lucifer," 
a slight dramatic sketch in lyrical measures and 
blank verse, closes the thin but not unattractive vol- 
ume. It gives us only the pale reflex of a cloistered 
mind, but delicacy of touch and the perceptions that 
accompany the cultured outlook are not lacking, 
and the pages are distinctly pleasing, although their 
perusal occasions hardly an emotional ripple. 

Mr. Reginald Fanshawe's "Two Lives " is an in- 
tensely subjective poem whose subject is " described 
as a spiritual pilgrimage from nothingness and de- 
nial to hope and fulfilment ; as a vision of the pro- 
gress of life, through the experience of nature, self, 
and, history, to God." It is put forth as a fragment, 
and provided with a philosophical preface which 
strikes the high note of seriousness maintained 
throughout the poem. It is written in the Spen- 
serian stanza, with interspersed lyrics. The title, 
"Two Lives," is to be taken in a twofold sense. 
Primarily, the song is one of personal bereavement, 
of two actual lives sundered by the death of a be- 
loved wife. Secondarily, it is a song of the higher 
life superadded upon the lower by the stern but 
ultimately gracious ministries of sorrow and of

thought. This latter aspect of the poem finds ex- 
pression in the " Introduction," wherein we read : 

" Two lives The human woof, 

The mystic warp divine, 
Woven by God, who worketh not aloof 

To his design 
Intrinsic ; whither all things climb and cross, 

Fulfilled, begun, 
Through death and beauty, dream and love and loss, 

So subtly pierced and spun 
By His pure Spirit, He doth use 
The whole world's service, sacramental, one, 

Unto its form's full continent, 

For high prophetic truth, and doth Himself infuse, 
Till twain be blent." 

It is not often that the ancestry of a poem is so 
strongly marked as in the present case. If the 
form derives from Spenser, the thought has the in- 
spiration of Tennyson, while of Shelley is the pas- 
sion and the lofty idealism. Indeed, this twofold 
debt is fully acknowledged, and the tributes to those 
great poets are among the finest things in Mr. Fan- 
shawe's spiritual autobiography. Here is one of 
the stanzas dedicated to Shelley : 

" And though anon his vision floated thin 

As dreamful cloud across the breathless blue, 
A pale soul, half monastic, half akin 
To earth, his passion, as it melted, drew 
The veil from off a far and sunny view 
Of a beauty and a brotherhood more free, 
And from a dawning, dyed to the full hue 
Of his own faith and golden phantasy, 
Sank in the purple bosom of a southern sea." 

And here is a stanza upon the death of Tennyson : 
" Leave him, where death's completing touch doth paint 
Round his pale forehead time's last aureole, 

And canonize in calm so true a saint 
Of song, who ever held his vision whole, 
Unsoiled ; through the pure ether of whose soul, 

As one sublimed to listen, set apart, 
God's music wrought and ripened by control 
For reconcilement's broad and mellow art, 

And beat through nature's bosom to his human heart." 

Mr. Fanshawe has written a very noble poem, and 
the world that cherishes " Epipsychidion " and "In 
Memoriam " will not lightly cast it aside. 

Mr. Grant Allen's versatility is so considerable 
that the public has learned not to be surprised at 
anything he may undertake. From his ingenious 
contention that Englishmen are Celts to his novel 
interpretations of Botticelli, from his opinion of 
Mr. George Meredith as the only living English 
novelist worth considering to his view of socialism 
as the only form of political organization that a 
serious thinker can advocate, we cheerfully accept 
the whole series of vagaries and wonder what outlet 
will be the next sought by the author's busy imagin- 
ation. To consider Mr. Allen as a poet we are in 
a measure prepared. He has put forth before this 
ballads of evolution and of socialism, as well as 
verses of classical provenance. His present " rem- 
iniscences of excursions round the base of Helicon, 
undertaken for the most part in early manhood," 
include a number of things that we have seen be- 
fore, and a number of others that we doubtless might 
have seen also had we searched for them. They 



are facile in versification, more or less imitative, oc- 
casionally humorous. Touches of passion are not 
wanting, as the revolutionary stanzas having three 
dates "1789, 1848, 1870" for their title shall 
testify : 

" The song of nations. Sing and clap your hands : 
Burst into blossom, all ye barren lands : 

She comes, to break the linked chains asunder, 
And snap in twain the adamantine bands. 

" She came before. Her cruel face and fair 
Smote all our breasts with infinite despair : 

She passed. The brightness of her lurid beauty 
Was fiercer than our dazzled eyes could bear. 

" She came again. In milder mien she came, 
With fruits and flowers crowned, but still the same. 
One lurid day crushed down her risen splendour ; 
She passed in murky clouds of smoke and flame. 

" Once more she comes. Surely our hearts are tried, 
And every lesser passion cast aside : 

Shall she not dwell among us now forever, 
Our one and only love, our deathless bride ? " 

This is from a group of poems written in 1871, and 
inspired by the Third Republic and the Commune. 
A bas la bourgeoisie ! is the cry of one of them, 
and the verses live up to their subversive text. But 
it is a little curious to find these things reprinted a 
score of years afterward. 

If we are not mistaken, it is a quarter-century 
since Dr. Garnett published his last volume of po- 
ems, and, indeed, the collection now published is 
made up in considerable part of pieces from the 
" lo in Egypt " volume that appeared as long ago 
as 1859. It evidently represents the author's ripest 
judgment upon his own work, and is a volume re- 
markable for elevation and originality. Such are 
the poetic glories of the Victorian age that Dr. Gar- 
nett, we fear, is fated ever to be reckoned a minor 
poet ; yet we cannot escape the thought that such a 
volume, in almost any other age of our letters, would 
have enshrined its author in all the literary histo- 
ries and made his name famous for years to come. 
We have chosen three extracts in illustration of the 
various aspects of Dr. Garnett's .verse. The first 
is a passage from the blank verse " Nausicaa," in 
which the maiden bewails the loss of Odysseus. 

" I cannot bear this evil any more. 
Teach me, again I pray, the art that comes 
Of wrestling with the lithe Protean sea. 
Then, some night, while these cliffs and feathery trees 
Spread the deep bay with shadow, ere the moon 
Surmounts them with her lamp, I will be here, 
Stand at the boat's prow, hallow the salt wave 
With sacrifice, then with a timorous oar 
Wrinkling the liquid darkness, urge myself 
Out on the bitter waste of death that hems 
My little isle of life, look where I may. 
For of three things the one, either I find 
My Ithacan, my royal mariner, 
Safe sceptered with the grey Penelope ; 
Then will I sue and serve her, spinning out 
My heartstrings with her wool, until I die. 
Or haply he has perished, and I crowd 
Long anguish into momentary death. 
Or liker, veers the blast, fills the frail bark, 
And o'er it mourns the sorrow of the sea."

ficulty, from upwards of a score, all subtly wrought, 
shall be our second example : 

'' ' Poet, whose unscarred feet have trodden Hell, 

By what grim path and red environing 

Of fire couldst thou that dauntless footstep bring 
And plant it firm amid the dolorous cell 
Of darkness where perpetually dwell 

The spirits cursed beyond imagining ? 

Or else is thine a visionary wing, 
And all thy terror but a tale to tell ? ' 
' Neither and both, thou seeker ! I have been 

No wilder path than thou thyself dost go, 
Close masked in an impenetrable screen, 

Which having rent I gaze around, and know 
What tragic wastes of gloom, before unseen, 

Curtain the soul that strives and sins below.' " 

Last of all we give the last two of the four stanzas 
that make up an exquisite poem called " Even- 
Star." 

" I see great cities rise, which being hoar 
Are slowly rendered unto dust again ; 
And roaring billows preying on the shore ; 

And virgin isles ascending from the main ; 
The passing wave of the perpetual river ; 
And men depart, and man remaining ever. 

" The upturned eyes of many a mortal maid 

Glass me in gathering tears, soon kissed away ; 
Then walks she for a space, and then is laid 

Swelling the bosom of the quiet clay.' 
I muse what this all-kindling Love may be, 
And what this Death that never comes to me." 

This reminds us of one of Tourgue'nieff's " Senilia" 
the striking dialogue of two Alpine peaks but 
has a touch of tenderness foreign to the suggested 
prototype. 

Mr. Gleeson White is an expert anthologist, and 
his "Book-Song" will be welcome to all who love 
the subject of which it sings. It contains poems, to 
the number of over one hundred and fifty, written 
in praise of books or their authors. The pieces are 
all modern, but we are told that a similar collection 
of "the golden numbers of past times " is in course 
of preparation by Mr. William Roberts. A certain 
indefiniteness of aim results from the fact that the 
compiler has ventured beyond the strict category of 
poems about books, and brought into his collection 
a number of personal tributes to the writers of books, 
thus drawing from a practically inexhaustible source. 
But the collection displays good taste throughout, 
and no one can complain of it as far as it goes. 

A limited edition of the sonnets and lyrics com- 
prising Rossetti's "House of Life," beautifully 
printed after the fashion of the Kelmscott Press, 
has recently appeared in Boston. The work is re- 
printed from the original text published in 1870. 
The later edition of 1881 differed from the earlier 
in the omission of one sonnet " Nuptial Sleep (Pla- 
cata Venere)" and in the alteration of a few others. 
Rossetti was influenced to make the changes by the 
disgusting pseudonymous attack of Mr. Robert 
Buchanan, and most of his friends thought him 
over-sensitive for so doing. A remark by one of 
Whitman's recent critics is equally to the point in 
the case of Rossetti and his contemptible assailant : 
"Indecent, in my opinion, these poems are not; 



but the criticism which universally selects them for 
discussion and condemnation is extremely indecent." 
The present publishers of "The House of Life" 
have reproduced the work (so they put it) " in its 
innocence and perfection." In thus acting, they have 
raised a delicate question of literary ethics, and even 
incurred some censure. " Have the dead no rights 
that the living are bound to respect ? " cries one in- 
dignant moralist. The cry seems to us entirely be- 
side the question. When a book has been given to 
the world it is, in a sense, irrevocable. With the 
right of keeping it to himself the author parts by 
the act of voluntary publication. If he afterwards 
wishes to withdraw it, or any part of it, he and his 
friends may plead for a deference to his wishes; 
they cannot fairly invoke his right. And in a case 
like this, where those nearest to the poet deprecated 
as unworthy the concession to a philistine sentiment 
that was involved in the revisions made, it is some- 
what hypercritical to take a publisher to task for 
preferring to reproduce the earlier of the two edi- 
tions. One might as well object to having the first 
edition of FitzGerald's "Omar" reprinted. And 
the whole question is surely one of anise and cum- 
min in an age which has tolerated the publication 
of the manuscript fragments of Shelley, the letters 
of Keats to Fanny Brawne, and the private papers 
of Carlyle. Until we have settled the weightier 
matters of the ethical law of literary property, it 
will be a misapplication of energy to discuss what 
are, in comparison, scholastic trivialities.

Reconstruction Few departments of learning have 
of the science suffered so severely from the bane 
of Logic. O f tradition and technicality as that 

which deals with the principles underlying all sound 
knowledge, the science of thinking. It is a most 
hopeful indication of the comprehensive and funda- 
mental character of the modern scientific reforma- 
tion, that it has brought with it a most thorough 
and radical recasting of the logician's outfit. After 
centuries of scholasticized Aristotle, and generations 
of text-books with no wider horizon than the re- 
quirements of an artificial educational scheme or 
still more artificial examination, it is the laudable 
achievement of the last half century to have laid 
the foundations of a more vitalized and progressive 
logic, to have overthrown the pertinacious and 
pernicious notion that the science of thought sprang, 
Minerva-like, perfect and pure from the head of the 
logical Zeus. It is as a contribution to this spirit 
of logical reform that the little volume by Mr. 
Alfred Sidgwick entitled "The Process of Argu- 
ment," recently issued by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., 
will find a ready welcome. Mr. Sidgwick devotes 
his pages to a general discussion of the principles

the fixation of belief, not as it might be carried on 
in the old-time disputations in which one champion 
set up a dogmatic chip on his shoulder and dared 
his opponent to find adequate authority for knock- 
ing it off, but as it occurs in the live and profitably 
debatable questions of modern science and modern 
thought. The distinction between observation and 
inference, the nature of generalization, the function 
of criticism, the significance of belief, the under- 
lying conceptions of cause and connection, the in- 
herent complexity of the arguments that dominate 
and create a point of view, the psychological basis 
of the thought-habit, are all suggestively but some- 
what vaguely sketched. This indefiniteness of state- 
ment and purpose is in part inherent in the topic, 
but a skill in presentation could have much reduced 
its prominence. No intelligent reader, however, is 
likely to leave the volume without conceding to Mr. 
Sidgwick the success of his main purpose, "to reach 
a conception of the general nature of ' argument ' 
(or battle between belief and doubt) which shall be 
a little less abstract, less artificially simplified, than 
that which the traditional logic has provided."

ner). Pending the appearance of the master who 
will some day tell for us the whole story of our lit- 
erature as it should be told, these careful studies of 
narrow periods are things to be grateful for, although 
there is no finality about them. The period with 
which Mr. Gosse's book deals is, of course, some- 
what arbitrarily limited by the dates of King James's 
reign, and is not a natural subdivision of our liter- 
ary history. Perhaps the chief value of the present 
treatment is to be found in its calling attention to 
the fact that we often mean Jacobean when we 
loosely say Elizabethan. For an assignment to 
" Eliza and our James " of the literary trophies of 
their respective reigns gives to the latter a large 
share of Shakespeare, and nearly all of the so-called 
Elizabethan dramatists Jonson and Chapman, 
Beaumont and Fletcher, Heywood and Middleton, 
Tourneur and Webster. Ford and Shirley were 
too late to be even Jacobean. Mr. Gosse has writ- 
ten a book of temperate and carefully-worded criti- 
cism, rather thickly packed with titles and dates, 
but for all that very readable, and extremely happy 
in its illustrative extracts. 



Tales of an To be a sportsman or at least to 

English hunter be thought one is the cherished am- 
in south Africa. bitbn of the leisured Englishman. 

If he cannot be an out-and-out Nimrod, he would 
rather be a Nathaniel Winkle than no sportsman at 
all. He shows a curious tendency to " revert," to pre- 
fer the ways and the habitat of the natural man to 
the milder arrangements of civil society. The jun- 
gle of India, the "bush" of Australia and South Af- 
rica, echo the crack of his rifle ; his knickerbockers 



are a known phenomenon on Kamschatka's frozen 
shores ; and we see him in America, touring prairie- 
wards, with his hat-box, tub, and other sporting es- 
sentials, in quest of buffalo, an enlivening specta- 
cle to the frontiersman. Mr. Charles Montague, 
author of " Tales of a Nomad " (Longmans), is one 
of these roving Britons who, for reasons to us in- 
scrutable, prefer " roughing it " in the wilds to a 
life of ease in Pall Mall or Piccadilly. To do him 
justice, Mr. Montague seems to have really been a 
mighty hunter. The book is chiefly made up of 
hunting-sketches, in which the writer gives the pith 
of his experiences, in a pleasantly off-hand, jaunty 
style, and without a touch of braggadocio. South 
Africa was the field of his operations, and all was 
game that came to his rifle including, on occasion, 
a stray Zulu, or even a Boer or two. He served 
as a volunteer in the Boer War, and gives a good pa- 
per on " The Siege of Marabastadt." Mr. Montague 
concludes the paper by predicting a " great future " 
for South Africa. Ultimately, he says, " there will 
be a confederation of South African States, and I 
think the Transvaal and Free State will join, pro- 
vided that such confederation is not under the Brit- 
ish flag. In another fifty years the people of South 
Africa will be united in the bond and sentiment of 
Africanderism, and the sad records of strife between 
British and Dutch will be blotted out forever from 
their historic pages." 



Contemporary

French Music " (imported by Scrib-

composers besides Gounod, who died before the vol- 
ume was out of the press. These are Ambroise 
Thomas, Saint Sae'ns, Massenet, Reyer, and Bru- 
neau. The sketches are written with intelligence 
and sympathy, and unite a happy mixture of biog- 
raphy and criticism not too profound for the appre- 
ciative but untrained concert and opera goer. The 
author detects in contemporary music the same ten- 
dency to realism that now invades art and liter- 
ature. As in literature the physiology of the mind 
appears to be the leading factor, so in music it is 
rather the minor motives of the action than its out- 
ward details that the serious operatic composer is 
tempted to depict. Truth of expression and dra- 
matic characterization are his chief aim. The French 
school has, during this century, left its mark in an 
undeniable manner upon operatic history, and the 
versatility of its composers has been proved over 
and over again. Hence a work like the present, 
analyzing the special peculiarities of the principal 
representatives of this school, is a welcome addition 
to musical criticism.

printing not having been invented and books being 
scarce, the lecture of the professor was the fountain 
of all knowledge. In the history of the human in- 
tellect, there is no more romantic period than this 
of the Mediaeval Renaissance. The students of that 
day were a rough set, wearing arms, and using them 
not only on the roads, beset by robbers, but in con- 
flicts with the townspeople, with whom the Univer- 
sity was, as it were, at war. Between this time and 
the present, with its comparatively mild town and 
gown rows, many changes have occurred. The Uni- 
versity has become a Federation of Colleges, each 
a little polity in itself, each cherishing its own tra- 
ditions and affiliations. The description of these 
in detail forms the principal subject-matter of Pro- 
fessor Smith's little volume. 



Art and its 
influence on 
civilization. 



Prof. W. H. Goodyear's treatise on 
" Roman and Mediaeval Art " ( Flood 
& Vincent) deals with the subject not 
so much in its technical aspects as with the history 
of art in its relations to civilization. Part L, occupy- 
ing about a third of the volume, treats of Roman 
art from prehistoric times to its decadence in the 
third and fourth centuries after Christ. The his- 
tory of mediaeval art of course covers a longer pe- 
riod and extends over a wider area of country. It 
terminated when mediaeval thought and culture, and 
consequently mediaeval art, were displaced by the 
movement known as the Renaissance. One hun- 
dred and fifty fine illustrations add greatly to the 
value of the volume, and a good index aids one to 
turn readily to any special subject among the many 
and varied branches of art discussed. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Charles Lewis Tupper, of the Indian Civil Serv- 
ice, has prepared an exhaustive historical and political 
study of " Our Indian Protectorate " (Longmans). The 
work has little excellence of a literary sort, but great 
value as a storehouse of facts and first-hand observations. 
To the important series of brief biographies entitled 
" Rulers of India " (Macmillau) two additions have 
been made. One of them, by Mr. Lewin B. Bowring, 
is devoted to " Haidar AH and Tipu Sultan," the Mus- 
sulman usurpers of Mysore. The other has for its sub- 
ject the great Clive, and is the work of that brilliant 
writer, Colonel G. B. Malleson. In connection with this 
group of books should be mentioned Mr. William 
Forbes-Mitchell's "Reminiscences of the Great Mu- 
tiny " (Macmillan), a graphic narrative from the pen of 
a participant not in the Mutiny but in the dramatic 
events which that uprising added to history. Mr. 
Forbes-Mitchell served in the ranks, and was in the 
thick of the fight during the eventful years 1857-59. 

To the " Rulers of India " series (Macmillan) Mr. 
John Bradshaw has added a life of Sir Thomas Munro. 
The author, who died before the book was printed, de- 
voted a quarter-century to educational work in India, 
most of that time being spent in the Madras Presidency, 
of which Munro was governor. " No name in any part 



of India," we are told, " is so familiar or held in such 
veneration as that of Munro is in the Madras Presi- 
dency, though two generations have passed away since 
his death." The new biography is based mainly on 
Gleig's " Life " and on the published letters of Munro. 

A pair of tasteful booklets come from the .Joseph 
Knight Co., Boston. One is a translation of Goethe's 
" Werther," the translator not being named. The 
other is the " Juliet and Romeo " of Luigi da Porto, in 
the translation by Brydges (1823). Mr. W. J. Rolfe 
writes an introduction almost as long as the story itself. 
Both of these " World Classics " are illustrated, bound 
in cloth, and neatly boxed. We may at the same time 
mention the pretty paper-covered reprints (Crowell) of 
Mrs. Gaskell's " Cranford " and M. Hale'vy's "The 
Abbe" Constantin," the former with a preface by Mrs. 
Ritchie, the latter with Madame Lemaire's charming 
illustrations. 

" The South Sea Islanders and the Queensland Labour 
Trade " (Macmillan) is further described as " a record 
of voyages and experiences in the Western Pacific from 
1875 to 1891." It is the work of Mr. William T. 
Wawn, " Master Mariner." Mr. Wawn was engaged 
during all these years as an importer of Kanaka labor 
into Queensland, and his book, which is little more than 
a roughly edited " log," is the record of a man who 
knows his subject. The book is a large octavo, with 
many illustrations. 

The biography of Coleridge prepared by Mr. James 
Dykes Campbell for the recent complete edition of Col- 
eridge's poetical works, and already mentioned by us in 
that connection, has been published as an independent 
volume (Macmillan), expanded to portly dimensions by 
the use of thick paper and larger type. This work took 
rank from the start as the authoritative biography of 
Coleridge, and is not likely to be improved upon. There 
are, however, a few revisions in the present issue, 
although it gives substantially the text printed with 
the poems. 

Volume XXXVIII. of the Dictionary of National 
Biography" (Macmillan) extends from Milman (Sir 
Francis preceding Henry Hart) to More (ending, not 
with the Thomases, but the Williams). The Moores 
and Mores get nearly a fourth of the volume. William 
Minto died just in time to get in. The most important 
of the articles is the " Milton," by Mr. Leslie Stephen, 
filling over sixteen pages, an unusual but certainly not 
undeserved allowance of space. 

Mr. Henry Bradley, who undertook to edit the let- 
ters E, F, G, and H, for the " New English Dictionary " 
(Macmillan), has completed his work upon the first of 
these four letters, and the last instalment of the " Dic- 
tionary," just published, begins with "Everybody " and 
ends with " Ezod," an obsolete variant of " Izzard," 
otherwise " Z." When Dr. Murray shall have finished 
his list of " words that begin with a D," they will form, 
together with the Es, the third of the portly quartos in 
which the work takes its final shape. 

The fourth instalment of the " Ariel " Shakespeare, 
now published (Putnam), presents a second group of 
seven comedies, including " The Two Gentlemen of Ve- 
rona," " The Merry Wives of Windsor," " The Comedy 
of Errors," " Love's Labour's Lost," " Measure for 
Measure," " Taming of the Shrew," and All's Well 
that Ends Well." Each play is prettily printed in a 
simple volume, and provided with outline illustrations. 
An early completion of the edition may be expected.

NEW YORK TOPICS. 

New York, April S3, 1894. 

Mr. George Haven Putnam's thoughtful article on 
"Results of the Copyright Law," in the January 
" Forum," was an excellent summing up of the situa- 
tion as developed since the passage of the Copyright 
Act of March 4, 1891. To my mind, his opinion that 
in spite of the law's defects " it would be unwise at this 
time to make any effort to secure amendments " is the 
correct one. At the same time, the fact that a petition 
has been brought into the German Parliament calling 
for the abrogation of the copyright agreement between 
the United States and Germany, and that this petition 
has been approved by the committee having it in charge, 
gives a serious turn to the copyright situation. Mr. 
Putnam in his article noted that " it is almost impos- 
sible for a French or German author to arrange to issue 
his book in this country (either in the original or in a 
translation) simultaneously with the publication abroad. 
The resetting in the original language, for such limited 
sale as could be looked for here, would be unduly ex- 
pensive, while time is required for the preparation of a 
satisfactory translation." The great trouble, Mr. Put- 
nam tells me, is that to secure copyright in a work in 
a foreign language, it must be re-set here in the original 
language. The copyright of a translation protects that 
translation only, and if the book is not also published 
in the original, anyone is at liberty to issue a new trans- 
lation. This state of affairs was brought about by the 
eagerness of the typographical unions to grasp every 
advantage. The French Society of Authors made this 
discovery some time ago, and now that Germany threat- 
ens to take the matter up, the result of the immense 
amount of labor performed by our copyright leagues is 
somewhat discouraging. After all, I presume that our 
copyright relations with Great Britain are the chief 
issue at stake, and these are progressing in a fairly sat- 
isfactory manner at present. It is curious to observe 
how closely the success of books by new English authors 
is watched by the American reprinters. Of course, the 
successful English author's second book at once finds an 
authorized publisher in the United States, and is copy- 
righted; but the way every new English success is pi- 
rated in this country shows plainly the need of a time 
clause in the Copyright Act as long as the printing 
clause remains. 

Another vexatious copyright question has been raised 
in a recent interview with Mr. Spofford, Librarian of 
Congress. I have not the slightest doubt that ninety 
in a hundred of those interested will be immensely sur- 
prised to learn from that interview that in the United 
States the name or title of a book is not protected by 
copyright. " The law is," said Mr. Spofford, " that the 
substance, the literary contents, of a book or publica- 
tion may be protected by copyright, but not the name 
not the title." The filing of title-pages of books in 
this country, which is required by law, is not, then, for 
purposes of protection, but for identification merely. 
This seems to be a great injustice, and I asked Mr. Put- 
nam if a change in this respect were not needed when 
the Copyright Act is next amended. Mr. Putnam as- 
sented, and gave me some interesting information as to 
the present condition of English copyright law on this 
point, and as to certain proposed changes. In England, 
Mr. Putnam said, the law as to book titles goes as far 
in the contrary direction as does ours, in that it permits 
anyone to copyright all the titles he can think of with 



or without any real intention to use them for actual 
books. This copyright in a title or titles lasts for the 
full English term of forty-two years, or seven years 
after the copyrighter's death. In many cases, au- 
thors of books have had to pay such copyrighters to 
relinquish titles on which they unluckily had stum- 
bled. Mr. Putnam thinks that authors should be at 
liberty to copyright the titles of their proposed books, 
but that such copyright should be completed by the 
publication of the book within a reasonable period (six 
months or a year), and that failing of this the copyright 
should become void. Also he thinks that copyright in 
a title should lapse if the book which it represents is 
out of print for a long period. The proposed new En- 
glish law, introduced by Lord Monkswell in the present 
parliament, and still pending, covers these points very 
fully. Copyright in a title must be perfected by pub- 
lication of the book within six months, and is lost in 
the case of books which remain out of print over two 
years. 

Pleasant news comes from the society of Provencal 
poets known as the " Fe'librige." M. Fe"lix Gras is now 
" capovlie," or president of the society, and will without 
doubt be reflected at the annual meeting to be held at 
Nimes on the twenty-ninth of April. The members are 
making preparations to take their share in the " floral 
games " this summer at Toulouse, which were instituted 
by the troubadours in the fourteenth century, and have 
never ceased since then. The games are open compe- 
titions in poetry and prose, and the prizes, it will be re- 
membered, are gold and silver flowers, or for the first 
prize a natural flower presented with a kiss to the suc- 
cessful competitor by some damsel of the ancient aris- 
tocracy. 

The members of the " Fe'librige " also celebrate their 
own annual feast in August, on the day of their patron 
saint, Ste. Estelle. This year it will take place at 
Avignon, and will be distinguished by the dedication 
of monuments to Roumanilles, the founder of the Pro- 
venc.al literary movement, and to Aubanel, who have 
recently died. " Les Cigalieres," the Paris chapter of 
the Fe'librige, will come down the Rhone on a boat from 
Lyons to take part in the ceremonies, and there will be 
performances of the Antigone and Edipus in the old 
Roman theatre at Orange, by the Come'die Franchise

Few men have been such " all around " scholars as the 
late William Robertson Smith. We get from "The 
Saturday Review " this glimpse of his manifold acquire- 
ments: "He knew many arts and sciences, few men 
have ever been privileged to know so many; but he 
made each of them, as it were, a part of his existence, 
and was a specialist in each. Apart from the two sub- 
jects which have made him famous, he was a well-read 
mathematician, and, in fact, held a mathematical chair 
for a time at Aberdeen as deputy to the professor. He 
was a profound student of most branches of law, En- 
glish and foreign. He understood the more abstruse 
branches of anatomy, especially that relating to the move- 
ments and functions of the eye. He was a good theo- 
retical astronomer. He might easily have posed as an 
eminent naturalist. He was both a botanist and a gar- 
dener an unusual combination. He had a fine ear for 
music, and a real knowledge of it. He was an admir- 
able architectural critic, with a strong leaning towards 
Gothic. He was a great numismatist, so great, and 
his collections so judiciously made, that we must hope 
his gold coins, at least, will now be acquired by the Uni- 
versity or some other public body." 



LORD BOWEN'S TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL. 
The late Lord Bowen was best known to literature as 
a translator of Virgil. " The Saturday Review " has 
this to say of his work: "The lay reader will attach 
greater interest to the work in which in intervals of 
the leisure of which his life now allowed Lord Bowen 
indulged alike his taste for intellectual exertion and his 
passionate admiration of the great master of Latin 
poetry. The task had for him a fascination which not 
all his consciousness of its difficulty enabled him to re- 
sist. He was travelling, as he described himself, along 
a road < strewn with the bleaching bones of unfortunate 
pilgrims who had preceded him.' They < had perished 
in the wilderness.' No one had satisfied the require- 
ments of this unachievable performance. In Dryden 
1 the silver trumpet has disappeared, and a manly strain 
is breathed through bronze.' In Conington ' the sweet 
and solemn majesty of the ancient form has wholly dis- 
appeared.' The task thus shown to be difficult Lord 
Bowen proceeded, with characteristic craving for per- 
fection, to surround by conditions which rendered it ob- 
viously impossible. The English rendering of Virgil 
must, if it is to be worth anything, be an English poem; 
the English poem must be a translation, not a mere 
paraphrase; and, as if these conditions were not suffi- 
cient to discourage endeavor, the poem must be made 
to rhyme, to indulge the English ear, and must be not 
only literally but lineally translated, in order to pre- 
serve the integrity of the famous Virgilian lines, which 
are the common coinage of civilized mankind. How 
far towards the accomplishment of such a feat it was 
Lord Bowen's good fortune to advance we care not now 
to estimate. Suffice it that on every page are to be 
found the same exquisiteness, the same patient indus- 
try, the same conscientious efforts at completeness that 
characterized every phase of Lord Bowen's work." 

WHY RENAN WAS NOT CONVINCED. 

M. Jules Simon, contributing some reminiscences of 
Renan to the " Revue de Paris," tells how the latter, in 
his seminary days; came to the author for advice. 

" He said that he came to see me because I was a Breton 
and a professor of philosophy. He wanted, he said, to 
ask my advice. His first word explained the situation 
to me. ' I am,' he said, ' a pupil at Saint-Sulpice. I 
must leave the seminary and put off this gown.' 

" This was not the first confession of the sort that had 
been made to me. But the others had spoken to me as 
philosophers, about the conditions of certainty, and the 
impossibility of reconciling miracles with rational prin- 
ciples. M. Renan talked nothing but philology. 

" You know,' he said, ' how inaccurate is the version 
of Saint Jerome, and the advantage derived by the 

apologists from the famous phrase .' He flattered 

me. The most remarkable thing about me is my pro- 
found ignorance. I bemoan and blush for it, but have 
never been able to make up for the defects of early edu- 
cation. I warned him of this, and begged him to enter 
into all the details necessary to explain the situation. 

" It seems that Abbe" Le Hir had quoted the phrase of 
Saint Jerome, and had deduced from it, in a luminous 
commentary, the authenticity of Revelation, with all 
the ensuing consequences. 

" < It was evident to me,' said M. Renan, ' that Abbe* 
Le Hir did not know Hebrew, which was sad in a pro- 
fessor of exegesis.' I nodded in assent. ' Although 
much agitated,' my visitor went on, I felt bound to 
warn him of his misunderstanding. I rose, bowed ac-

cording to custom, and pronounced the usual formula: 
Liceat loqui, pater reverendissime. Do veniam, he kindly 
said. I then set forth that his argument was very 
strong, but that it rested upon the text of Saint Jerome, 
which embodied a contradiction. " You would be right," 
I said to him, " if Saint Jerome had faithfully translated 
the Hebrew. But here is the Hebrew text, which says 
the exact contrary, hence it follows that you are wrong." ' 
' And what did Abbe" Le Hir say ? ' I exclaimed, much 
interested by this glimpse at the seminary household. 
' He reflected for some time,' said M. Renan, ' then 
he gently addressed to me these very words: " Monsieur 
1' abbe", you will recite the seven psalms of penitence on 
your knees before the holy sacrament." ' ' And you,' I 
said to him, ' what did you reply ? ' I replied what 
is replied in such a case: Gratias ago quam maximas, 
pater dilectissime. ' And you did your penance ? ' 'I 
did it.' Then he delivered a panegyric upon Abbe' Le 
Hir, which he concluded with these words : ' But he did 
not know Hebrew.' 

" ' And then ? ' I asked. ' I returned to the charge,' 
said Renan, and only got the same answer. But I can 't 
spend my life in reciting the psalms of penitence.' 

" I smiled. He mused. But I did not perceive the 
poignant anxiety of a Christian who is about to lose his 
faith. I saw rather a philosopher who, taking a step 
in the direction of truth, discovers new horizons. I was 
at once much struck by the situation. I said to myself 
that this was no passionate, self-tormented soul like 
Lamennais; that he lived upon curiosity, calm, resolute, 

smiling." . 

INSIDE VIEW OF AN EGYPTIAN UNIVERSITY. 

A correspondent of the New York " Evening Post " 
gives the following interesting particulars about the 
University of Cairo: "The scene presented by the uni- 
versity when teacher^ and pupils are absorbed in their 
tasks is strange indeed. The various classes are com- 
posed of singularly incongruous elements, for childhood 
and old age, beardless youths and mature men, sit side 
by side and learn and recite the same lesson, all sway- 
ing to and fro as incessantly as the pendulum of a clock. 
These motions are sometimes of a wild and convulsive 
character, painful to witness, and bear a strong resem- 
blance to the ecstatic contortions and twitchings of the 
dervishes. The majority of the scholars, too, whether old 
or young, are not pleasing to look upon, for the Egyptians 
are a far less handsome and less cleanly race than the other 
Arabs of northern Africa, nor are their costumes nearly 
as picturesque. Each class consists of about a dozen 
members, who form a circle around the sheikh or pro- 
fessor, by whom they are initiated into the mysteries 
of the alphabet or made acquainted with a page of the 
Koran, as the case may be. The voices are harsh and 
discordant, so that a lesson in progress sounds like a 
dispute. The teacher tests the knowledge of the pupils 
by questions, and they in turn question him." 

The curriculum of the university is thus described : 
" Chemistry, astronomy, astrology, and the higher 
mathematics, once considered indispensable acquire- 
ments for a scholar, have for many centuries been laid 
aside, and importance is attached only to the study of 
the Koran, including a knowledge of rhetoric and logic. 
This rote-like system of education naturally represses 
all originality of thought. Besides the Koran, a few 
primers and readers are in use as text-books, and slates 
and blackboards are employed as in other schools. 
Even less reading than writing is taught, a certain fa- 
cility in learning by heart alone being considered im- 



perative. The study of grammar begins the regular 
academic course; then follows a course in religion, and 
one in the science of law." 

The account is brought to a conclusion as follows: 
" There are three grades of sheikhs, the last being sel- 
dom attained. Up to the year 1871 any student who 
had committed the whole of a book to memory was 
dignified with the title of sheikh, and enjoyed the priv- 
ilege, accorded to the instructors only, of leaning against 
a pillar. Since that time a formal examination has been 
required, and six sheikhs belonging to different sects 
judge of the fitness of the competitors for the position. 
The largest attendance at the university was in 1876, 
when the scholars numbered over eleven thousand and 
the professors three hundred and twenty-five; yet only 
one year later the number of pupils had decreased by 
more than three thousand, and that of the sheikhs by 
nearly a hundred. This extraordinary decline - a de- 
cline still continuing is to be ascribed to the ravages 
of war among the Mohammedans, and to the civilizing 
influence brought to bear upon the Egyptians by the 
English government, which is doing so much for their 
enlightenment."

ROGER WILLIAMS, K;: 

THE PIONEER OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. ;"'.'':*''"'' 

By OSCAR S. STRAUS, 

Author of "The Origin of the Republican Form of Government in the United States." 
biographies of Roger Williams have been written, most of which are now out of print. Since the 
J^ publication of these earlier works much valuable additional information concerning the pioneer of religious 
liberty in America has come to light. Mr. Straus, the author of the present biography, has given careful 
study to the subject of Roger Williams and his work. He has searched anew the records of the Charter House, 
where Williams attended school as a pensioner, and also the records of Pembroke College. Among other things 
he has succeeded in determining the year of Williams's birth, a matter which has long been the subject of contro- 
versy among genealogists and historians of New England. 

Roger Williams is one of the most unique and picturesque characters in our history. His life was one long 
battle for religious liberty. The hostilities and prejudices he encountered have such vitality that they have come 
down by tradition and inheritance to our times. The author of this biography has endeavored to bring out the 
truth without fear or favor, and to present an impartial record of the character and work of this remarkable man, 
who was in the fullest sense the pioneer of religious liberty.

A BOOK FOR BOYS AND GIRLS BY RUDYARD KIPLING. 



THE JUNGLE BOOK. 



A perfect treasury of delight for young folks and old folks too. 

No one but the author of " Plain Tales from the Hills," " Soldiers 
Three," etc., could have written the fascinating stories that are contained in this volume stories of the Indian 
jungle, of Kala Nag, the elephant; Shere Khan, the tiger; and old Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the 
wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle; of Bagheera, the black panther; and of Kaa, the python, whose blow is like the 
blow of a steam-hammer. Readers of " St. Nicholas " will remember the stories of " Rikki-Tikki-Tavi," " Too- 
mai of the Elephants," " Mowgli's Brothers," and " Tiger, Tiger," which originally appeared in that magazine 
and attracted wide attention. These stories which the New York " Christian Advocate " has described as 
" unique in literature and perfectly delightful in spirit " are published in the present volume, with additional 
illustrations, and to them are added " Kaa's Hunting," "The White Seal," and "Her Majesty's Servants." It 
is safe to predict that " The Jungle Book " will become a classic in children's literature a book the youngsters 
will clamor for even after they know all the stories by heart.

of an artist, and an artist whose work is quite as remarkable in its execution as in its invention . . . Most interesting is his use of the single 

line, with which he weaves his drawings into a harmonious whole, leading you to properly regard the concentration of his motives. . . . Mr. 

Beardsley has managed to appeal to artists and what more could he wish? "

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 

The valuable character of the work done for 
secondary education by the Committee of Ten, 
and the cordial reception everywhere given to 
its report, have led to the organization of a sim- 
ilarly representative Committee of Fifteen for 
the purpose of considering the important sub- 
ject of city school organization. This Com- 
mittee, consisting for the most part of school 
superintendents, has already held a number of 
meetings, and has planned its work in a man- 
ner at once practical and exhaustive. It will 
be at least a year before the conclusions of the 
Committee can be fully formulated, but an out- 
line of the work to be undertaken has already 
been published, and proves so suggestive that 
we cannot refrain from a few comments. 

In the first place, the composition of the 
Committee of Fifteen commands respect, in- 
cluding, as it does, many educators of the high- 
est professional standing. The names of Dr. 
W. T. Harris, Mr. W. H. Maxwell, Mr. A. S. 
Draper, Mr. A. G. Lane, Mr. A. B. Poland, 
and Mr. H. S. Tarbell are a sufficient guaran- 
tee of the scholarship and the experience that 
will be brought to the deliberations of this 
body. The Committee has been divided into 
three subcommittees, having for their respect- 
ive subjects, city school systems, the training 
of teachers, and the correlation of studies. 
This corresponds with an eminently wise and 
practical classification of the work to be done. 
Finally, a carefully-considered list of questions 
has been prepared for each of the sub-commit- 
tees, and will form the basis of the discussion. 
Expert opinions upon these questions will be 
collected by the members of the subcommittees ; 
each member will report to his chairman ; and 
each chairman will report to the full Commit- 
tee of Fifteen, which is to meet in November. 
This admirable plan of work should result in 
bringing together a body of competent opinion 
sufficiently weighty to force itself, in its main 
lines, upon the acceptance of educational au- 
thorities throughout the country. 

We have space to call attention to only a 
few of the questions offered for discussion, but 
it is easy, for our present purpose, to distin- 
guish between questions of broad and theoret- 
ical interest and those of a more technical char- 



292 



[May 16, 



acter. In the consideration of the former, 
there is an a priori element (or at least an ele- 
ment based upon inductions made in a wider 
than the strictly educational field) to be taken 
into account ; the latter are mostly to be de- 
cided by an appeal to educational experience 
alone. Should the members of a board of ed- 
ucation be elected or appointed ? To what ex- 
tent should teachers study psychology ? What 
should be the purpose of attempting a close 
correlation of studies? are questions of the first 
class. Of how many members should a board 
of education consist ? At how early an age 
should young men and women be allowed to 
teach ? What should be the length of recita- 
tion periods ? are questions of the second class. 
We hope that the committee will recognize this 
distinction, and, with the first class of ques- 
tions, collect their opinions largely from work- 
ers in extra-educational fields. 

To the subcommittee on city school systems 
a highly important series of questions is as- 
signed. They deal with the organization of 
the executive machinery of education, the dis- 
tribution of powers among boards, superintend- 
ents, and teachers, and many cognate topics. 
A committee made up of superintendents will 
probably seek to magnify the importance of the 
function of superintendence, at the expense of 
the board of education and the staff of instruc- 
tion. They will be justified in the one attempt, 
but hardly in the other. Whether a board of 
education be constituted by election or appoint- 
ment (and we look for a strong consensus of 
opinion in favor of the latter method), it is not 
likely to prove competent to direct the profes- 
sional work of instruction. A wise board will 
delegate nearly the whole of its nominally ab- 
solute powers to the educators directly in 
charge of the school system, and restrict itself 
to the function of business management. 

The relation of superintendent to instruct- 
ors, on the other hand, is not so easily to be 
defined. The writer whose recent criticism of 
our public schools has attracted more attention 
than any other, and whose opinion certainly 
deserves consideration, loudly proclaims that 
more superintendence is the one thing needful 
for the well-being of the body educational. 
But there is something better than superin- 
tendence, and that is a teaching force which 
does not need superintendence. And even with 
the teaching bodies that we now have, there is 
a good deal of superintendence that does more 
harm than good. The sort of person who gets 
to be superintendent of schools in many of our 



counties or smaller cities is not a person to 
whom we may point with pride. Even in our 
great cities, the superintendent is too likely to 
fall a victim to the mania for mechanical uni- 
formity, whereupon dull routine displaces vital 
teaching in the schools that are unfortunate 
enough to be subject to his rule. A case in 
point is offered by the question, By whom 
should text-books be selected ? which is among 
those proposed for this subcommittee. To our 
mind, the answer is clear enough. Subject to 
certain limitations of cost and scope, they 
should be selected by those who are to use them. 
Nothing stands in the way of this natural and 
rational answer but the bugbear of uniformity, 
or the notion that teachers are incompetent to 
select their tools (to which objection the reply 
is obvious), or some utterly trivial talk about 
the cost of buying new books when there are 
old ones in the family. As if the education of 
every child, upon which we lavish money so 
freely in other directions, were not worth the 
paltry additional price of a few books. 

The questions proposed to the subcommittee 
on the training of teachers cover such matters 
as the requirements of scholarship, the accept- 
ance of successful school work in lieu of exam- 
ination, the scope of the training-school, and 
the value of such subjects as psychology and 
the history of education. While we do not dis- 
pute the advantages of normal school work in 
many cases, we do not think it should be treated 
as an indispensable requirement. After all, 
the practice of teaching is not a subject to be 
taught very effectively ; people learn to teach 
by actual experience, and hardly in any other 
way. The teacher should doubtless know some- 
thing of the history of education, but this knowl- 
edge is best acquired by one who is really doing 
educational work, and its previous acquisition, 
from books and lectures, is of questionable 
value. As for psychology, it would be difficult 
to overrate the importance of this subject, but 
the sort of stuff that passes for psychology in 
too many of our normal schools is about as use- 
less as anything that could be devised. We be- 
lieve emphatically in admitting young people to 
the work of teaching upon their school records 
rather than upon examination, but the records 
must be intelligently made and used as a basis for 
judgment. Those who have had actual charge of 
a young woman's education, who have come into 
daily contact with her for years, and studied the 
development of her mind and character, know 
very well whether or not she is a fit person to 
entrust with the delicate work of teaching chil-

dren; no examination, however well-planned and 
comprehensive, can possibly furnish so trust- 
worthy an estimate as may be had from her 
teachers, in her last year or two of school work. 

This leads us to a point of fundamental im- 
portance, one not expressly suggested by the 
questions proposed. Fitness to teach is too fre- 
quently regarded as a matter of scholarship 
alone, to be determined by examination or re- 
citation records. But even scholarship is less 
important than character, and what sort of ex- 
amination can be suggested as a test of moral 
fitness ? In some of our city school systems lit- 
tle attention, or none whatever, is paid to char- 
acter ; that is, no systematic inquiry is made 
into the spirit in which the student has done 
her school work, into her application, her trust- 
worthiness, her moral habit, her general serious- 
ness of aim. No examination and no scholar- 
ship record sheds other than a weak reflected 
light upon these things, and thus can furnish 
no real test of fitness in the highest sense. In 
cities where teachers of the primary and gram- 
mar grades are mainly furnished by the grad- 
uating classes of the high and normal schools, 
it ought to be made a sine qua non that the 
applicant for a position should have a certif- 
icate of character from those who have taught 
her during the closing year, or possibly two 
years, of her course. In this matter, an abso- 
lute veto should be placed in the hands of the 
instructors. We hope that the Committee of 
Fifteen will add this to their list of subjects, 
and pronounce upon it in no uncertain tones. 
We can think of no single reform that would 
do more for our city school systems than a gen- 
eral recognition and application of the princi- 
ple above enunciated. The difficulty under- 
lying the whole school problem is the difficulty 
of getting good teachers ; defective scholarship 
and unfit character are the twin roots of the dif- 
iiculty, and the reform that we now urge would 
strike most effectively at one of these roots. 

The subcommittee on correlation of studies 
is occupied mainly with questions of a techni- 
cal character, such as may safely be left to the 
expert judgment of its members. Some of the 
questions have already been discussed by the 
Committee of Ten ; others of them offer new 
problems for solution. To determine the dis- 
tinct pedagogical value of the several studies, 
and to establish the sequence of topics upon a 
rational basis, appear to be the chief tasks set 
before this subcommittee. The conclusions 
reached will cause much discussion, for the 
problems are among the deepest that confront 



scientific pedagogy. In conclusion, we must 
express our great satisfaction at the new evi- 
dence offered by the constitution of the Com- 
mittee of Fifteen that the organization of Amer- 
ican education is rapidly advancing, in spite of 
the necessary and permanent decentralization 
imposed by our political system, and that by 
the sort of concerted action of which the Com- 
mittees of Ten and Fifteen offer types, our edu- 
cational system seems likely soon to emerge 
from the haphazard stage, soon to enter upon 
a more scientific, and hence a more fruitful, 
phase of its development. 



JOSEPH KIRKLAND. 

The author of " Zury " and The McVeys " died 
in Chicago the morning of April 29, at the age of 
sixty-four. Among men of letters having their homes 
in this city, no one was more widely known than 
Major Kirkland, or more deserving of his reputa- 
tion. That reputation was acquired late in life, and 
based mainly upon three novels (" The Captain of 
Company K " in addition to the two above named) 
which take a high rank among American works of 
realistic fiction. Their author was an enthusiastic 
admirer of the work of Mr. Thomas Hardy, and it 
was upon the lines laid down (or, at least, chiefly 
represented in contemporary fiction) by that novel- 
ist that his indubitable success was achieved. In 
addition to the three novels named above, Major 
Kirkland published "A History of the Chicago 
Massacre of 1812," and told " The Story of Chi- 
cago " in a large volume, the most interesting treat- 
ment of the subject that has ever been made. He 
also contributed to the magazines, and was for a 
time literary editor of the Chicago " Tribune." He 
was one of the organizers of the Twentieth Century 
Club of Chicago, and was its first president, hold- 
ing the office for two years. He was prominent in 
the Chicago Historical Society and the Chicago Lit- 
erary Club. He was also one of the few Western 
members of the Authors Club of New York. He 
came of an intellectual ancestry, his father having 
been a professor in Hamilton College, and his mother 
a writer of some note in her day. He was born at 
Geneva, N. Y., in 1830, and came to Chicago in 
1856. At the outbreak of the Civil War he en- 
listed in the Twelfth Illinois Infantry, became suc- 
cessively lieutenant, captain, and major, and was 
for a time attached to the staff of General McClel- 
lan. He was in the battles of Rich Mountain, Lau- 
rel Hill, Williamsburg, and Fredericksburg, and at 
the siege of Yorktown. He practised law in Chi- 
cago from 1880 to 1890. Personally, Major Kirk- 
land was one of the most genial of men, always 
bright and companionable, and he made many warm 
friendships. He will be sincerely mourned by an 
exceptionally wide circle of friends and associates.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



ENGLISH AT LAFAYETTE COLLEGE* 

It is thought to be somewhat of a specialty in 
the Lafayette teaching of English, that the profes- 
sors in all departments take part in it. The theory 
is that the main cause of mistakes in speaking and 
writing English is ignorance of the meaning of 
words. Our grammar is simple, but we catch up our 
words without thought, and utter them again in the 
same way. On the athletic field we do not know 
walking from running, nor at the banquet pie from 
pudding. When we undertake to talk about any 
scientific subject, the expert detects us instantly ; 
we call whales fishes, mix up sewage and sewerage, 
and use force, energy, and power as if they were all 
the same. 

An earnest attempt is made at Lafayette to train 
the students in each department to write on sub- 
jects connected with it in the words and phrases 
current among experts. The professors in each de- 
partment are, of course, authorities. Every stu- 
dent is required to hand in two papers a term ; there 
are three terms in the college year. The professors 
give out subjects which demand research and de- 
scription in their own departments, and much time 
is spent by many of them in inculcating not only 
clear-cut meaning, but also the etymology of scien- 
tific terms. They find the sesquipedalia of the sci- 
ences cannot be held in memory with precision un- 
less their elements are distinctly perceived. This 
leads to some knowledge of scientific philology, and 
of accurate spelling. The students in the chemical 
laboratory under Professor Hart, the president of 
the Chemical Section of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science, use the rules of 
the Association for spelling and pronunciation ; they 
know when to write the termination -in, and when 
-me; they are not to be caught blundering with 
chlorin or quinin, hydrid or oxid, or sulfur. The 
amended spellings recommended by the joint action 
of the English and American Philological Societies 
and given in the Century Dictionary are accepted 
as correct in college papers, as well as the common 
spellings in Webster and Worcester. 

Over and above all this is the study of English 
in literature. We find the statement in the his- 
tories of Lafayette that the college had " European 
recognition " for its study of English before the 
present historical and literary courses were known 
at other colleges. The Lafayette courses were 
established with the maxim that English should

Teaching of English at American Colleges and Universities, 
of which the following have already appeared in THE DIAL :

be studied like Greek." A special professorship 
was established coordinate with the Greek and Latin 
professorships, with the arrangement emphasized 
that the professor was not to have the rhetoric, 
and general theme-writing, and other the like du- 
ties, but was to handle English classic authors with 
his classes, study Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton r 
after the same methods as Homer and Demos- 
thenes. This was a pretty precise description fifty 
years ago. Now there are many ways of study- 
ing Greek, and all of them often scamped in our 
universities. It meant then thorough work. Teach- 
ers were fond of repeating after Dr. Arnold of 
Rugby, " What a treat it would be to teach Shake- 
speare to a good class of young Greeks in regener- 
ate Athens ; to dwell upon him line by line and 
word by word, and so to get all his pictures and 
thoughts leisurely into one's mind, till I verily think 
one would, after a time, almost give out light in the 
dark, after having been steeped, as it were, in such 
an atmosphere of brilliance." 

The Lafayette courses are still constant to this 
central idea. They are primarily devoted to the 
study of the language as it is found in masterpieces 
of literature, the immediate aim being the interpre- 
tation of these masterpieces, the rethinking of the 
thoughts of master minds, and storing the memory 
with their words. Four hours a week during two 
terms, Junior year, are spent with a professor in 
recitations ; two additional hours are allotted to the 
preparation for each recitation. Three of the reci- 
tation hours each week are occupied in the Arnold 
fashion, dwelling line by line and word by word 
upon worthy passages. In a play of Shakespeare, 
for example, and one term is regularly devoted to 
a play of Shakespeare, a scene, a short scene, may 
be given out for a morning's study. A consider- 
able part of it will be read rapidly, or the gist of 
it given in a few words, and most of the hour will 
be devoted to a few lines selected as worthy of thor- 
ough study. Any obsolete words or phrases, or 
singular constructions, will be explained ; but the 
secret of Shakespeare's power is not to be found in 
these. The words which are bearers of special 
meaning or feeling are usually familiar words. In 
searching for their power and charm, the student 
will trace them through all the places where Shake- 
speare uses them, using the Concordance to bring 
them all together. He will use the Historical dic- 
tionary to learn what associations had gathered 
around them in the earlier ages, beginning some- 
times in Beowulf, and accumulating as they pass to 
Alfred, to Chaucer, to Tyndale, to Spenser, and are 
used by each with some happy turn or in some mu- 
sical rhythm. He will often find that the peculiar 
meaning in Shakespeare begins with him, and then 
it will be pleasant to trace it in later authors, re- 
peated in quotation or allusion until it becomes per-

and literatures, rhetoric and oratory, prosody and 
rhythmic art, psychology, and biography, may be

drawn upon, and all available pedagogical arts used 
to lead the student livelily to rethink the thought 
and perceive and feel and remember the beauty 
of the language. In this way students come to re- 
joice in these noble passages, and remember them 
forever. They are thus provided with the very 
words to guide their higher thought, and with forms 
of graceful speech which prompt them to easy utter- 
ances of courtesy and affection and devotion. 

Three of the four hours a week with the professor 
are used in this way ; the fourth is given to a kind 
of symposium or seminar. Some topic of research 
belonging to the subject is given out for an essay, 
which all the class are required to hand in. The 
hour is spent in the reading of essays and criticism 
of them, and further discussion of the topic car- 
ried on by the class under the prompting and guid- 
ance of the professor. One such hour may be given 
to the life and environment of the author ; another 
to the plot of the play, if one of Shakespeare's plays 
is to be studied ; others to critical discussion of par- 
ticular scenes as wholes and as proper parts of the 
play ; others to notable characters in the play. 
There may be philological papers on the language 
of the play and of the poet ; papers on the origin- 
ality of the work, how much of it is Shakespeare ; 
reports of the criticism of particular great critics ; 
outlines of other related works. We used to have 
lively work of research, frequent peering into all 
corners of the library, and rejoicing in exploiting 
fresh mines of fact ; but bibliographic indexing is 
now so copious, Poole's Indexes in the van, and 
the librarians are so at the service of everybody, 
and omniscient, that research begins and ends too 
often with asking the librarian to hand over every- 
thing there is on the topic, and point out the pages. 
And the essays are apt to show plainly enough that 
they were written with the books open before the 
writers, as Shakespeare had North's Plutarch when 
he wrote Julius Caesar. The essays can hardly 
claim the credit of research, but often have merits 
which students rank higher than research, and make 
good material for collisions of memory and wit com- 
bats at the symposia. 

All this is required work. For Shakespeare there 
is also a prize examination open to all who have fin- 
ished the required work. This is general, covering 
his life, character, all his works, from any points of 
view which the examiners may choose at the exam- 
ination. The professor is content with questions 
which call for direct knowledge of the works and 
reflection upon them; such as naming plays and 
asking for a description of them, and asking which 
is the best and why ; when they were written and 
the evidence for the dates ; naming persons and 
asking for their characters and action; giving quo- 
tations and asking where they are found, and the 
like simplicities ; but examining committees are apt 
to confront the student with the profoundest ques- 
tions in psychology and history which the Germans 
have evolved. The winning of this prize is esteemed 
one of the highest college honors. 



There are two divisions of the students who do 
not take courses in Greek and Latin. These take 
courses of English, German, and French, which are 
so taught as to supply similar linguistic training to 
that obtained from the Latin and Greek. They 
study term by term some English classic just as 
the others do their Latin classic, giving it four reci- 
.tatioii hours a week. Authors commonly selected 
are Bunyan, Spenser, Chaucer, Bacon. With a gen- 
eral method such as has been spoken of in connec- 
tion with Shakespeare, philological topics are taken 
up in progressive order, term after term, such as to 
prepare these students to unite with students of 
Latin and Greek in the second term of the Junior 
year, and go on with the philological study of En- 
glish. Four lessons a week in Anglo-Saxon for 
two terms are required of all students except tech- 
nicals. They are given near the end of the lin- 
guistic courses required in college when the students 
have studied their German, French, Latin, Greek, 
nearly to their completion. The West Saxon as it 
appears in the principal literary works is presented 
as a classical language, and the whole time is de- 
voted to it as to a sister speech of classical Latin. 
It is studied, we say, like Greek. The class begin 
to read at once extracts from the Gospels. They 
also learn the grammar, the rules for pronunciation, 
and practice reading the text aloud. They learn the 
paradigms, and rules of syntax, so as to parse rapidly, 
declining and inflecting freely. They learn the 
rules of letter change, a selected set of them. They 
already know from their other language studies 
Grimm's law and the like. They learn for continual 
use the paradigms and syntax, and the common 
phonetic changes within the West Saxon, and from 
West Saxon to English. The examination at the end 
of the first term of Anglo-Saxon is almost wholly de- 
voted to these matters, and it is known from the 
first that they must be learned in order to pass with- 
out conditions. 

In the second term Anglo-Saxon prosody is added 
to the grammar work, but the time is given mainly 
to reading Anglo-Saxon authors as we read modern 
English authors in this course, and to throwing 
light upon modern English words and idioms by con- 
necting them with their ancient forms. Besides the 
class examinations, a prize is offered to those who 
complete the courses for the best general examina- 
tion in English before Chaucer ; and an additional 
optional course is given to prepare for examination 
questions upon the deduction of the Anglo-Saxon 
forms from originals in the Parent Speech and other 
comparative grammar, and for additional reading, 
and literary and biographic and bibliographic study 
in connection with it. 

The chief use of study of English before Chau- 
cer to the American college graduate, the person 
who used to be known as the gentleman and scholar, 
is to help him to better understanding and mas- 
tery of English in Chaucer, and since Chaucer. 
The literary charm and power of the works which 
have survived from the earlier period is slight in

comparison with that of the old masters of Greece 
and Rome, and of the still greater modern authors 
in our own language and other modern languages, 
who mold the thoughts of modern men. It would 
seem best, therefore, to devote that moderate por- 
tion of time which ought to be given to this study in 
college to a few typical specimens of Anglo-Saxon, 
and to the comparative study of their idioms in re- 
lation to modern English, so as to fix in memory 
illustrative originals to guide and strengthen our 
speech. No one but an incipient professor of lan- 
guages can well afford to spend his days and nights 
for long periods of his crowded college life in study- 
ing books of specimens of all the various early dia- 
lects of those groping centuries. 

This series of required studies for the whole class 
is continued during the second term of Senior year 
by two exercises a week, with weekly written papers 
from each student arranged for the general study 
of some author, and the writing of an elaborate ar- 
ticle, as if for a quarterly review, which must con- 
tain a discussion of the language of the author. 
With the work of this term goes another prize. 
The best work is done when the author selected is 
an American. Students find their own life and 
thought depicted in the American authors. The 
language is their own. They are specially drawn 
to them. In the college reading-room the Amer- 
ican periodicals are worn to tatters, while the En- 
glish publications, which were the main reading of 
students of the last generation, lie in fair covers, 
looking fresh from the binder. Bryant, Irving, 
Longfellow, Lowell, Mrs. Stowe, Whittier, Holmes, 
have been handled with most hearty and sympa- 
thetic admiration and intelligence. One of the tra- 
ditional high-days of Lafayette is that on which 
Mr. Bryant made the public presentation of this 
prize for the best study of his own works to J. W. 
Bright, of '77, now Professor of English Philology 
in Johns Hopkins University, his torch still burn- 
ing as he runs in the front. 

During the same term a rapid general survey of 
English literature is given with a compendium, class 
discussions, and conversations, two hours a week. 
And four hours a week of the last term of the Senior 
year are given to a review and summary of the lin- 
guistic side of the college studies in connection with 
Professor Whitney's Language and the Study of 
Language, a required study. 

Lafayette is a college of some three hundred stu- 
dents, and does not advertise University courses. 
It receives, however, graduate students, and there 
are always some such pursuing English studies. A 
few continue them, as major courses, far enough to 
earn a Ph.D. It might be said, therefore, that we 
have all the courses in English, the description of 
which fills so many pages of the great University 
catalogues. There are two professors : F. A. March, 
Professor of English and of Comparative Philology ; 
and F. A. March, Jr., Professor of English Liter- 

ature - F. A. MARCH.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



EDUCATION AND LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In connection with the discussion in THE DIAL on 
the Teaching of English at American Colleges and 
Universities, it may not be amiss to emphasize certain 
tendencies in the scope and method of literary educa- 
tion, as bearing on the future of literature. Certainly 
the immediate prospect for literature is not bright. 
Our civilization is daily becoming more democratic; 
the people draw all activities toward themselves; and 
the literary artist is more than ever tempted to be un- 
true to himself, to yield to the popular demand and 
truckle to the average taste. Style, as characteristic 
creativeness, as the expression of lofty individuality, is 
neither wanted nor appreciated by the great mass of 
readers. Your thorough-going democrat believes in 
complete equality, material and intellectual; and he 
who is unlike or peculiar is regarded as either foolish 
or conceited. The great host of self-assertive self-sat- 
isfied people despise what they cannot understand, or 
jest at it. An illustration in hand is the recent vulgar 
skit, so universal in the newspapers, about President 
Cleveland's hard lot in being obliged to hear Mr. Gilder 
read his latest poem. Such is the bourgeoise temper. 
It may appreciate literary cleverness or smartness, but 
it will flout at talent and genius, at all sustained and 
dignified discourse and high poetic sentiment. In the 
hurry of this eager, unquiet, democratic age, if men 
read at all they will read only what appeals directly to 
them at the first glance, what is short to scrappiness 
and is startling staccato in expression. In brief, the 
democratization of literature means a childish impres- 
sionism. 

However, it is folly to lament this tendency, with the 
pessimists, or, with Matthew Arnold, to rely hereafter 
upon a " saving remnant." Since literature is not, and 
is never likely to be, as in the past, a product for the 
few, since the kind of writing which the people demand 
is the kind of writing which will be done, the only hope 
of literature is an educated public. I take it, then, that 
the importance for literature itself of the right study 
of literature in our schools and universities can scarcely 
be overrated. But the results of present methods can 
hardly be regarded as satisfactory. Many of our col- 
lege graduates and most of our high-school graduates 
read little more than that lowest form of literature, the 
newspaper. Not one in a hundred, in consulting hi& 
own taste, takes up an English classic, reads Milton and 
Shakespeare and Wordsworth simply because he likes 
them. And certainly, for the great majority, school in- 
struction in literature results in no marked and perma- 
nent uplifting of taste. I am far from saying that liter- 
ary education is a complete failure, but I thoroughly 
believe that it is generally very defective in spirit and 
method. 

The chief difficulty arises at bottom from a lack of 
practical realization of the true end of education as to- 
tal process. The real object of education may be de- 
fined as a preparation for that largest, freest, most orig- 
inal development of the mind which is the goal of 
human evolution. And this development ever has been,, 
and ever will be, distinctly five-fold: religious, moral^ 
philosophic, scientific, and artistic, each in its own 
way, yet forming an interdependent organism of cul- 
ture. A true education, as the vestibule of life, must 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



297 



contain all these forms as coordinate; every scheme of 
unprofessional education ought to realize these factors, 
each for its own sake, an ideal which is yet far before 
us. Just now parvenu science, crass, boorish, and over- 
bearing, as the parvenu generally is, has got the upper- 
hand in education. Hence we see in literary education, 
as everywhere else, the undue stress laid on the scientific 
method, and literature constantly and dominantly in- 
terpreted from the standpoints of anthropology, psy- 
chology, history, and philology. It is certainly inter- 
esting and useful to look at literary art from other 
standpoints than its own ; but for the educative study 
of literature the main point of view must always be the 
purely aesthetic. The prime object is not to inform the 
understanding, but to develop the taste, to lead the stu- 
dent to spontaneously recognize the best art whenever 
and wherever he finds it, and, what is more, to like it, 
yea, even to love it. Not one educated man in a hundred 
knows good literature when he sees it; he must rely 
upon some critic, or upon his knowledge as to the fame 
of the author, and straightway he will try to discover 
the beauties he has been taught to expect. But this 
is not genuine taste; the deeper and real life does not 
respond, and if emotion there be, it is wholly artificial. 
The student openly applauds what he is taught to ap- 
plaud, but in secret he reads and praises the meretri- 
cious and sensational. 

For the formation and development of a genuine in- 
dividual taste the student should be led into direct and 
unbiased contact with the best art. He should not even 
know the author of the piece he is reading, but by re- 
peated study should get a thoroughly original impres- 
sion and give expression to it orally or in writing be- 
fore he receives any instruction. The free initiative and 
spontaneous interest must always be led up to and 
waited for. I would suggest giving a class a short poem 
for a half-hour's original study, and asking for written 
answers to such questions as, What lines please you 
most ? Why ? What is the strongest part of the poem ? 
What the weakest ? How does it compare with poems 
previously read ? What would you judge as to the au- 
thor from internal evidence ? The student should grad- 
ually come to a knowledge of authorship from internal 
criticism alone, and the author should always be subor- 
dinated to his works. That best art which is self-in- 
terpreting and simple in its aesthetic elements should 
mainly be used. After a measure of taste for the good 
art is definitely formed, examples of poor and bad lit- 
erature should be interspersed for detection and criti- 
cism. If this appreciative direct study of literature 
were made the main method throughout the whole 
course of education, the ground covered would not be 
so great as now, but the results in the improvement of 
taste, and indirectly in the elevation of literature itself, 
would, I think, be far more considerable. 

A subsidiary method which may sometimes be of 
value in sharpening the critical sense with advanced stu- 
dents is to require from them actual literary work. 
However, appreciativeness is by no means vitally con- 
nected with executive ability. Indeed, the literary critic 
and the litterateur are often quite distinct. To enjoy 
good writing I no more need to be a writer, than to be 
a musician to enjoy good music, or a preacher to enjoy 
good preaching. The greatest fallacy in the education 
of to-day is the so-called laboratory method, so far as it 
supposes that we need to become scientists in order to 
appreciate science, and artists in order to appreciate 
art. However, we cannot enlarge on this point here. 



I conclude that a genuine revival of high art in our 
democratic civilization is impossible until the general 
taste be elevated, and this elevation must be largely at- 
tained through the improvement in scope and method of 
artistic education. Goethe truly says, " Happy is the man 
who early in life knows what art is"; and this insight 
into the real nature of art can only be reached and sus- 
tained by a constant familiarity with the best art dur- 
ing the whole period of education.

UNEXPECTED HAPPENINGS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While the readers of THE DIAL have in memory Dr. 
Hall's replies to my letters, kindly permit me to bring 
to their attention two or three of the odd things with 
which these replies abound. A brief preliminary ex- 
planation in each case is necessary. 

I. Although a word or a phrase in Lord Macaulay's 
writings has sometimes arrested the unfavorable atten- 
tion of Dr. Hall, yet, in the main, Lord Macaulay's En- 
glish has received Dr. Hall's approbation. In fact, 
there are passages in Dr. Hall's discussions of good and 
bad English which give one the impression that, at the 
time they were penned, he looked up to or, rather, 
upon Macaulay as an unquestionable exemplar of cor- 
rectness. Among the evidences of his regard for the 
authority of Lord Macaulay are the following: 

" Let us now turn to another writer of high and deserved 
repute, the last of our really well informed lingual conserva- 
tives. Like Dr. Newman, Lord Macaulay uses, "etc. ("Mod- 
ern English," p. 292, footnote.) 

" I have called the word [helpmate'} classical. Lord Macau- 
lay writes, in the first chapter of his History : ' A waiting 
woman was generally considered as the most suitable help- 
mate of a parson.' " ( Ib., p. 156, footnote.) 

" . . . it has been seen how many fashions of speech which 
he [R. G. White] rejects and ridicules are practically war- 
ranted by Lord Macaulay. ..." (" Recent Exemplifications 
of False Philology," p. 107.) 

" That which he [De Quincey] deems to be the English of 
' French reporters ' was good enough English, in the last cen- 
tury, for Jeremy Benthani, and is good enough, in our cen- 
tury, for Lord Macaulay." (Ib., pp. 18-9.) 

"... even such a purist as Lord Macaulay has used " [cer- 
tain words named]. (" Modern English," p. 142.) 

" Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more than 
once." (Ib., p. 300.) 

It was natural that I should want to avail myself of 
an authority so highly esteemed by Dr. Hall, when, in 
reference to a certain use of known to and a similar use 
of unknown to, I was citing (THE DIAL, July 1, 1893), 
in opposition to Dr. Hall's opinion, quotations from many 
writers of excellent standing. Several passages from 
Macaulay's writings containing the " breach of idiom " 
disapproved by Dr. Hall were before me, but limita- 
tions of space prevented the use of more than one, viz. : 

"Most of these wretches were not soldiers. They acted 
under no authority known to the law." (Macaulay, "Hist. 
Eng.," ch. xii.) 
To which I added: 

" A remark made by Dr. Hall concerning another locution 
may be appropriately quoted here : ' Even such a purist as 
Lord Macaulay uses it more than once.' ( ' Modern English,' 
p. 300)." 

Now, as to the point so made (which to me seemed 
rather strong), there was an unexpected happening. All 



298 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



that Dr. Hall said about this point was in a postscript 
to his reply. It reads as follows: 

" P-S. ' Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more 
than once.' This sentence Mr. Williams quotes from me as 
' a remark ' which I make ' concerning another locution.' Is 
my remark amiss as to its wording: ? or in what it expresses ? 
I am at a loss to know." (THE DIAL, August 16, 1893.) 
This postscript is Dr. Hall's whole reply to my cita- 
tion of Macaulay and to my quotation from " Modern 
English " showing Dr. Hall's opinion of Macaulay as 
an authority, and that the censured locution was useci 
by him more than once. That the author of " Modern 
English " should fail to see the obvious application oJ 
that plain sentence cited against himself from his own 
book, who could have anticipated ? But so it came to 
pass. 

II. Most people when expressing their thoughts in 
print take more care in regard to forms of expression 
than when writing confidential letters to familiar friends. 
This, I suppose, is true even in the case of writers whose 
style in print is colloquial and familiar. Moreover, a 
form of expression found in a private letter is not an 
instance of its use by the writer in print, even though 
the letter be subsequently published in a book. Private 
letters often get into books, but publication does not 
convert their phraseology into expressions used in print. 
My apology for stating and insisting on matters so 
obvious will be found in the fact that, obvious as these 
simple truths are, they have been wholly overlooked by 
,Dr. Hall in his reply (THE DIAL, Dec. 1, 1893) to my 
letter published in THE DIAL, September 1. Strange, 
as it is, with my words before him (for he quotes them 
correctly). Dr. Hall offers, in contradiction of a remark 
of mine, citations which by the very terms of the remark 
itself are excluded. And strange, too, he rests his case 
on those citations. He produces no other new ones. 
In THE DIAL for September 1, I said: 
"Although I have noticed two instances (one in a letter) 
besides the one cited above by Dr. Hall, where the ' imperfect 
passive ' was employed by Dr. Newman, yet I am confident 
that its use by him at least in print was very rare." 

After more than a column of desultory preliminaries, 
Dr. Hall proceeds to upset the confidence expressed by 
me above in this manner: "Between 1832 and 1846 he 
[Dr. Newman] was, according to his own adjudication, 
'guilty of':" then follow six quotations from Cardinal 
Newman's Letters (1891) " published since his death. 
As the volumes in which these letters appear contain, 
besides the " Letters," some things actually written by 
Cardinal Newman for publication, I have taken pains 
to find the context of these quotations, in order to as- 
certain beyond a doubt whether the passages cited by 
Dr. Hall are parts of private correspondence or whether 
they occur in writings intended for the public. Every one 
of these six instances of the " imperfect passive " cited by 
Dr. Hall occurs in a private confidential letter written 
to a familiar friend. Not one of them militates against 
my reservation as to the use of the imperfect passive 
by Cardinal Newman in print. Dr. Hall, however, in- 
troduces them with, " If he [Mr. Williams] had gone 
farther afield, he would have made the discovery," etc. ; 
and supplements them with " Nor, perhaps, would it be 
altogether amiss, if he redoubled his diligence of re- 
search." All this, be it remembered, after quoting from 
me the precise words that shut out such citations. A 
very unexpected happening. 

III. Dr. Hall's reply (THE DIAL, Dec. 1, 1893) opens 
with the following statement: 



" Descanting on English Imperfects Passive, in the Appen- 
dix to my 'Modern English' (1873), I say, respecting 'the 
sort of phraseology under consideration,' that 'some of the 
choicest of living English writers employ it freely.' I pro- 
ceed : ' Preeminent among these stands Dr. Newman, who 
wrote, as far back as 1846,' etc. A single relevant citation 
from him is then adduced. 

" Mr. R. 0. Williams, in your issue of September 1, takes 
exception to my qualifier 'freely.' " 

No, begging the writer's pardon I have never in- 
timated a doubt of the alleged fact that " some of the 
choicest of living English writers employ it freely." 
Dr. Hall's statement of the issue does not define it with 
sufficient exactness. The question raised by me was 
" whether Dr. Hall, at the time he wrote the remarks " 
quoted by him above, " had knowledge of such a num- 
ber of instances where Dr. Newman had used this lo- 
cution in his voluminous writings, that he, Dr. Hall, 
could fairly say, either by direct assertion or by impli- 
cation, that Dr. Newman employed it " freely," 

whether, in other words, Dr. Hall, at the time he made 
the assertion relative to Newman, had in his knowledge 
sufficient evidence to justify it. The doubt was sug- 
gested by (among other things) : (1) a very strong an- 
tipathy which Newman had expressed for is being; (2) 
the fact that Dr. Hall, in thirty-nine pages of text given 
to the discussion of is being, etc., had cited but one in- 
stance of its use by Newman, notwithstanding the pre- 
eminence assigned him among " some of the choicest of 
living English writers "; (3) that several inferior writ- 
ers were, each, cited more than once; (4) a strong be- 
lief that the use of is being, etc., by Newman " at 
least in print was very rare." 

Dr. Hall, in the course of his desultory reply tells us 
when he found (in 1872) the said instance of the use of 
the " imperfect passive " by Newman, and that, at the 
time he found it, he recalled the fact that he " had in 
the past observed his use repeatedly of like expres- 
sions." " My memory," Dr. Hall adds, " though I sel- 
dom trust to it, seldom plays me false." He then proves 
the accuracy of his memory and my ignorance of New- 
man's usage in regard to is being, was being, etc., by 
bringing forward the quotations I have commented on 
above (II.), quotations cited from an edition of 
letters published nineteen years after his memory had 
rendered the service specified. The citations would 
be pertinent if offered by Dr. Hall as evidence of his 
clairvoyance especially if they had been produced by 
him before the publication of the private letters where 
the passages quoted occur but they cannot prove that, 
in and before 1872, Dr. Hall had seen in Newman's 
publications so many examples of the " imperfect pass- 
ive " that he could fairly put Newman among the au- 
thors of whom he said " some of the choicest of living 
English writers employ it freely." That Dr. Hall could 
take such a view of the matter as his reply discloses was 
by me quite unexpected. 

IV. The likening me to a lame devil that needs spec- 
tacles (I admit the spectacles imputation) was unex- 
pected in merely this the particular form of similitude 
chosen. 

V. Some unexpected things in Dr. Hall's replies have 
been mentioned. Another thing not at all unexpected 
should be noticed by a brief remark. A characteristic 
feature of all Dr. Hall's replies to my letters is the as- 
sumption that convincing evidence can be rebutted by 
his bald assertion. R Q WlLLIAMS .

BOOKS ABOUT THE SEA.* 
Fifty years ago a sailor was a sailor not 
the mere lubberly roustabout or deck-hand one 
sees on an ocean steamer nowadays. His du- 
ties were as multifarious as his oaths, and his 
yarns were as stiff as his tarpaulin hat. His 
accomplishments were endless. He could "reef, 
furl, steer, and handle," splice you a rope (not 
forgetting the main brace) in a twinkling, tie 
twenty different knots wall knots, diamond 
knots, bowlines, loop, reef, or stopper knots, or 
what you will in as many minutes ; he was 
sailor, sail-maker, rigger, carpenter, painter, 
tailor a nautical Jack of all trades, in short, 
to order ; usually he was a cheery companion 
and a fertile and engaging liar to boot. His 
delight in telling of what he had seen only fell 
short of his delight in telling of what he had 
not seen. Fifty years ago, too, a ship was a 
ship not a dirty, snorting Brobdignagian tea- 
kettle, a thing the gallant Farragut refused to 
go to well, to Tarturus in. She was a thing 
of grace and sentiment ; a part integral of the 
element she adorned ; a pearl on the expanse of 
lapis lazuli; in the distance, a white-winged 
phantom slanting away before the breeze like a 
mist-wreath. But, as the song says, " the ship 
is gone and Jack is gone "; and with them the 
glamour of sea-faring and its legendary lore. 
" Tom Bowling " is no more ; and we suppose 
" Black-eyed Susan " " waves her lily hand " 
nowhere but in Mr. Gay's ballad. Nobody 
cares to picture a " Vanderdecken " or an 
" Ancient Mariner " cruising about in a steam- 
boat ; and the " sea-change " suffered is, on the 
whole, a very prosaic one indeed. 

The little book entitled " Twenty Years at 
Sea," by Frederick Stanhope Hill, gives, in 
Part I., a very realistic picture of sea-life half 
a century ago. As far as it goes, it is as good 
as Dana. The author, now an " old barnacle-

teen ; and his log recounts his professional pro- 
gress from the greenhorn phase of " granny " 
knots and deck-swabbing, to the dignities and 
emoluments of able seamanship. The narra- 
tive is duly spiced with mutiny, pirates, " shang- 
haeing," etc.; and the best of it is, it is all true. 
Part II., " In the Naval Service," relates to 
the Civil War ; and here the author recounts 
some sufficiently thrilling exploits and inci- 
dents, quorum pars magna fuit. Mr. Hill's 
manner is well suited to his matter, and his 
book is emphatically one that any normally- 
minded boy (and we believe there are some 
left, in spite of Lord Fauntleroy) can revel in 
and profit by. 

The work entitled " The British Seas " is a 
collection of picturesque notes of the British 
coast and its adjacent waters, by W. Clark 
Russell and others. To the reader at all " salt " 
in his tastes it is a captivating book, brine- 
scented and echoing the voices of the ocean 
like a Norse saga. Six of the papers " The 
Downs," " Down Channel," " The North Sea," 
etc. are Mr. Russell's, and we need scarcely 
add they contain some capital " bits of marine," 
as the painters say. Here is one a fleet of 
North Sea smacks putting out for the fishing 
grounds : 

" As they clear the entrance the tide catches them, 
and away they go in fine style, scattering as the tow- 
ropes are let slip, and plunging like galloping cart-horses 
as they take the first of the seas and wash away to the 
northward. Others again, to save towage-charge, ' ratch,' 
out as it is called, and a spirited sight it is to witness. 
The seamanship of the fellows is excellent ; they appear 
to know their little ships as a man the horse he has rid- 
den for years ; you see a smack under a heavy press 
leaning down to it till her waterways are under, and 
heading direct for the granite of the pier ; her bowsprit 
seems to be in the act of spearing the solid wall, when 
down goes her helm, round she spins like some waltz- 
ing girl, nimble of foot ; in a breath or two all is flat- 
tened in fore and aft, and she is smoking through it on 
the other tack." 

In other papers Mr. Russell takes us to Rams- 
gate (that paradise of London " 'Arry " and 
" 'Arriet "), Sandwich, Hastings, Brighton, the 
Isle of Wight, Cardiff, Newcastle, Whitby, 
etc.; he describes the life-boatmen, smugglers, 
whalers, fishermen, and the like amphibians, 
in a way that must have charmed Ed'ard Cut- 
tle, mariner ; he sketches with graphic pencil 
many a sound, harbor, and foreland ; and he 
opens for us the door of tiny public houses, 
haunted by 'longshore Jack, who loves, as Mr. 
Besant truly says, when not afloat, " to sit 
where he can gaze upon a harbor, and ships, 
and the blue water outside." And through the 
open door of these snuggeries there floats an

eloquent whiff of rum and tobacco, and usually 
the sough of some sailor's yarn. " There she 
blows ! " one seems to hear him say. " ' There 
she blows ! ' I sung out from the foretopmast 
head. 'Where away?' they bawls from the 
deck. ' On the weather quarter,' says I. ' There 
she blows ! ' Up comes the cap'n. ' Down hel- 
ium ! ' he says, says he. * Luff her to the wind. 
Round in on them lee braces, and aft with your 
main-sheet, Mr. Deadeye,' says he to the mate. 
' Get them jib-sheets flattened in, and make 'er 
all snug for goin' about. Shake a reef out o' 
the foretopsail, and loose the foretop-garns'l. 
This 'ere bucket 's got to laugh to-day ! ' " And 
so he drowses on, hoarse as a nor'wester, com- 
fortable, mendacious. Almost as good as Mr. 
Russell's are the sketches by Messrs. Cagney, 
P. Of. Hamerton, and James Purvis. The vol- 
ume is liberally illustrated with half-tone plates 
after Turner, J. C. Hook, H. Moore, Colin 
Hunter, Arthur Turner, and others. 

The initial volume (devoted to Hawkins, 
Drake, and Frobisher) of the series of selected 
narratives from Hakluyt entitled "Voyages 
of the Elizabethan Seamen to America " has 
reached a second edition. Three voyages of 
Hawkins are given, three of Frobisher, and 
one of Drake, together with Briggs's account 
of the Armada. The narratives, on the whole, 
seem to bear out Mr. Froude's characterization 
of Hakluyt's book as " the prose epic of the 
modern English nation." Of the several rela- 
tors in the present volume, John Sparks, who 
writes of Hawkins's second voyage, seems to 
bear away the palm, at least in point of liter- 
ary quality. The negroes of Africa, the West 
Indian Caribs, the Florida Indians, are described 
by him with much freedom and vivacity, and 
not altogether, one fancies, without a touch of 
Sir John Mandeville's inventiveness. Writing 
of Florida, Sparks makes a deduction in nat- 
ural history that is very amusing. Having " as- 
certained " that the region possesses unicorns, 
he straightway concludes that it abounds in 
lions, on the cogent ground that " every beast 
hath its enemy." Thus, the wolf is the natural 
enemy of the sheep, the polecat of the rabbit, 
the rhinoceros of the elephant. So it is with 
the lion and the unicorn. Now Florida " hath 
its unicorns "; ergo, lions must abound there 
also. Q.E.D. That Mr. Sparks fortified his 
argument by first catching his unicorn, does 
not appear. The volume is edited by Edward 
John Payne, M.A., who has added a full and 
scholarly introduction, and a brief account of 
Hakluyt's life and works. 



The last though most important work on our 
list is Mr. Edgar Stanton Maclay's " History 
of the United States Navy " a book, by-the- 
bye, that is not likely to cool the ardor of those 
young naval men who are charged with a sin- 
ful desire to test their new ships and new guns 
on a real enemy. Mr. Maclay's History is, we 
believe, the first attempt at a full and contin- 
uous record of the kind, and it is in the main 
a satisfactory one. The style is spirited and 
popular, and the author has evidently tried to 
be accurate and full. New facts have been 
drawn from the records, old facts have been 
reweighed and recast, and altogether the book 
is likely for some time to hold its place as the 
chief popular authority on the subject. Mr. 
Maclay is a specially good hand at describing 
a sea-fight. The immortal duel between the 
" United States " and the " Macedonian," for 
instance, is depicted in a style that would not 
discredit Smollett, and will probably set the 
" Fighting Bob Evanses " of our navy to fur- 
ther lowering themselves in the eyes of quer- 
ulous and low-spirited editors. In his intro- 
ductory Mr. Maclay summarizes the services 
of the navy. These, he thinks, " it would be 
difficult to exaggerate." During the Revolu- 
tion the Continental cruisers took from the en- 
emy about 800 vessels, which involved the cap- 
ture of, at a modest estimate, 12,000 prisoners, 
500 of whom were soldiers of the best English 
regiments. In the two years' naval war with 
France, about 80 vessels, carrying over 3000 
men, were taken ; and the Barbary wars gained 
for the United States privileges that were de- 
nied to European powers. 

The naval war of 1812, Mr. Maclay rightly 
says, " did more to humble the-pride of Great 
Britain than any other contest." For the sec- 
ond time since the Armada there was a cloud 
upon her title of Mistress of the Seas. At the 
outbreak of the war the British navy was in 
the zenith of its glory ; when it closed, British 
commerce was " almost annihilated." Out of 
eighteen engagements, the royal navy counted 
fifteen defeats ; and this after the London 
" Statesman " of June 10, 1812, had said : 
" America certainly cannot pretend to wage 
war with us ; she has no navy to do it with." 
Over 1500 vessels were taken from the En- 
glish, and more than 20,000 of their seamen 
were made prisoners. John Bull was hit hard, 
in his purse and in his pride, and for the time 
even the new-blown glories of Trafalgar were 
forgotten. The American victories " spread 
a degree of gloom over London that was most

painful to observe " wrote an eye-witness, in 
a tone that recalls Pepys's lament over the ad- 
vent of the Dutch in the Medway. When the 
news of the loss of the first frigate reached En- 
gland, the " Times " gravely observed : " The 
loss of a single frigate by us, it is true, is but 
a small one ; when viewed as a part of the 
British Navy it is almost nothing ; yet under 
all the circumstances of the two countries to 
which the vessels belonged, we know not any 
calamity of twenty times its amount that might 
have been attended with more serious conse- 
quences to the worsted party." But when the 
capture of the second royal frigate was an- 
nounced, the " Thunderer " exclaimed, fairly 
startled for the moment out of its measured 
monotone : u In the name of God, what was 
done with this immense superiority of force ! 
Oh, what a charm is hereby dispelled ! The 
land spell of the French is broken, and so is 
our sea spell ! " It was manifest to the thick- 
est British apprehension that the superiority 
of the English to the American navy lay in 
numbers and armament alone ; and that Brit- 
annia's sea-rule had passed from the roll of the 
" eternal verities." Napoleon's prediction in 
1803, when Louisiana was ceded, that he had 
given to England " a maritime rival that would 
sooner or later humble her pride," had reached 
an early fulfilment. 

Mr. Maclay devotes some space to showing 
that the figure-juggling resorted to by English 
writers to explain away English defeats only 
exemplifies the pliability of figures in the hands 
of those who have a case to make out. He has 
taken, we think, some unnecessary trouble here. 
The childish excuse that in every case (and 
there were a good many of them) in which a 
British ship was worsted by an American the 
latter was superior to the former in guns and 
tonnage, is a lame one on the face of it. Plainly 
stated, the truth seems to be that in the naval 
war of 1812 John Bull, grown somewhat over- 
confident, was soundly thrashed, at his own 
style of fighting, by his vigorous offspring. 
Whatever consolation he may draw from the 
fact that the victor was his own flesh and blood 
he is entitled to ; but we respectfully decline 
to entertain the plea that in each encounter he 
was " out of condition." 

Mr. Maclay has spiced his narrative with a 
sprinkling of anecdotes, one of which (smack- 
ing not a little of " Roderick Random ") touch- 
ing Lord William Fitzroy, a son of the Duke of 
Grafton and the first commander of the "Mace- 
donian," we quote. His lordship was an agree- 



able compound of the martinet and the snob : 
" He may not have been a first-class sailor, but he 
was thoroughly conscious of his exalted rank, and was 
an enthusiastic disciplinarian. Bold indeed was the 
officer who had the temerity to address him as cap- 
tain,' or to reply to his commands with a 'Yes, sir,' 
instead of < My Lord,' or Yes, me lud.' The ' Mace- 
donian' had not been many days out on her maiden 
cruise when an incident happened that will illustrate 
Captain Fitzroy's temperament. While she was at Lis- 
bon one of the sailors, named Bob Hammond, came 
aboard intoxicated, and on the next day he received 
four dozen lashes for the offense. As soon as the pun- 
ishment had been inflicted, Bob applied himself lustily 
to the bottle, and before night he was again ' gloriously 
drunk,' and while in this condition he suddenly conceived 
the idea of making a sociable call on the captain, just 
to show that he harbored no ill will for the flogging he 
had received. Marching up to the quarter-deck, he ac- 
costed his commander in the free-and-easy style with 
which one good fellow should address another, and said, 
< Hello, Billy, my boy, is that you ? ' Observing that 
he had made an impression, Bob followed up his ad- 
vantage by saying, < you are young and foolish, my boy 
just fit to launch. You are like a young lion, Billy, 
all your sorrows are to come.' As soon as the noble 
lord could recover his voice he shrieked out, ' Put that 
man in irons ! ' " 

History records that next day Robert was 
again triced up to the grating, and received his 
reward in the shape of an extra five dozen from 
the boatswain's cat. We regret to say that 
Captain Fitzroy was not aboard the "Mace- 
donian " when she fell in with the " United 
States " some months later. 

The present volume, opening with a resume 
of colonial maritime matters, treats of the naval 
phases of the Revolution, of the French and 
the Tripolitan Wars, and of the War of 1812 
up to the action between the " Essex " and the 
" Phoebe " and the " Cherub," off Valparaiso. 
The narrative will be continued and the record 
brought down to date in Vol. II. Print and pa- 
per are good, and the illustrations are interest- 
ing. We think it regrettable that there are no 
portraits. Mr. Maclay has evidently written con 
amore ; and while his work is free from brag 
and jingoism, it shows a hearty enthusiasm that 
goes far to cover minor faults of style. It is 
a good book to read and to cause to be read 
especially now that American patriotism is be- 
come a rather parti-colored affair and largely 
the resultant of a half-dozen or so exotic pa- 
triotisms. It will certainly do our racially- 
diverse coming generation no harm to learn 
from Mr. Maclay what they owe to the Deca- 
turs, Lawrences, and Perrys, the men who made 
the flag of the young Republic a valid passport 
on the high seas.

SOME RECEXT EDUCATIONAL, BOOKS.* 

No feature of current educational history in 
the most progressive countries is more marked 
than its literary feature, as expressed both in 
periodicals and in books. The volume of such 
literature is constantly swelling. Buisson's list 
of works in French (Dictionaire de Pedagogic, 
1882-87) contains two thousand titles, and is 
confessedly incomplete ; while Compayre states 
quite correctly that the German language is 
still richer in such publications. The two great 
English-speaking countries have done less than 
France and Germany, but they have still con- 
tributed largely to swell the stream. In the 
United States, besides importing and publish- 
ing much of the best that appears abroad, trans- 
lating it when necessary, we every year pro- 
duce a considerable number of new educational 
books, of varying degrees of value, to say 
nothing of the mass of periodical publications, 
in which no doubt we surpass any other coun- 
try. Unfortunately, we have no American 
pedagogical bibliography that is complete or 
approaches completeness. Inferior as our work 
may be, in some particulars, to the best that 
is produced abroad, we still have in Dr. Bar- 
nard's " Journal of Education " the most val- 
uable magazine of educational knowledge that 
has ever been collected in any single work in 
any country. Then the increasing variety of 
educational literature should be remarked. 
The two great departments, of course, are 
theory and practice and history ; but the works 
devoted to these subjects are flanked right and

left by a great array of papers, dissertations, 
studies, essays, and articles devoted to almost 
every conceivable educational subject, many of 
which contain valuable materials that will ulti- 
mately find their way into the standard litera- 
ture of education. It may justly be said that, 
as the volume of this literature worthily repre- 
sents the totality of educational activity, so its 
variety well represents the multiform character 
of such activity. 

Within a generation there has been a notice- 
able change in the general character of the 
more permanent literature. A vigorous at- 
tempt has been made to remove from mental 
and moral training the old-time reproach of 
empiricism, by seeking a scientific basis for its 
processes. The term " pedagogy " has not only 
come into reputable use in Germany, France, 
and Italy, but it has gained considerable head- 
way in the United States, and even made some 
impression in England. But those who dis- 
allow the word recognize the thing. Dr. Bain 
calls his well-known book " Education Consid- 
ered as a Science," and other writers give us 
other combinations of the same words. In this 
country the new tendency may be very easily 
illustrated. Page's " Theory and Practice of 
Teaching," published in 1847, was fully abreast 
of the best thinking of the time, in its partic- 
ular field. It was an excellent book, and has 
been more widely read than any other book on 
teaching ever published in the United States. 
It is still read, and is still well worth reading, 
abounding as it does in sound ideas, in admir- 
able illustration, and in enthusiasm. But it is 
not scientific ; the " theory " is as practical as 
theory can well be made. " Consciousness " 
is found four times in the index, and is always 
limited by the phrase " of success "; neither 
" psychology " nor " mental science " appears. 
A better book of the old type can scarcely be 
found, but it does not suit the changed tem- 
per of the times. 

In no point is the new tendency more pro- 
nounced than in the scientific exploration of 
the child mind ; or, using the latest neologism, 
what is called " paidology." This movement 
had long been heralded. Rousseau sent his own 
children to the foundling hospital, but behind 
doors he would listen eagerly to the talk of 
the children of others. Madame Neckar ad- 
vised mothers to note in a journal each step of 
progress that their children made in all the vi- 
cissitudes of physical and moral health. " Like 
the psychology of the child, pedagogy itself, 
at least in its first chapters," says Compayre, 



1894.]

" ought to be conceived and written near a 
cradle." No other name is so closely iden- 
tified with this new line of research as that of 
Professor Preyer, whose previous treatises, 
" The Senses and the Will " and " The Devel- 
opment of the Intellect," together constituting 
one work entitled " The Mind of the Child," 
are a magazine of facts, carefully observed, 
closely sifted, and wisely discussed. Preyer's 
new book, "Mental Development in the Child," 
is on the same lines, only it is much less com- 
prehensive, and is particularly intended to 
bring the subject down to date and to initiate 
mothers into the science of child study. " For 
after all," the Professor observes, " the observ- 
ation of mental development in the earliest 
years naturally falls to the mother more than 
to any other person. But in order to initiate 
mothers into so complicated a science as that 
of psychogenesis, the results already attained 
in it must be presented to them in a form as 
easy of assimilation as possible. Other per- 
sons also teachers, both male and female, 
fathers, older brothers and sisters are to be 
induced to consider the importance of the facts 
in this field, which has indeed been lying open 
for hundreds of years, but has been little trod- 
den, and is therefore a new field." 

For some years American investigators have 
been pressing into the field of child study, Dr. 
Stanley Hall leading the way ; but no better 
work has been done by any of these students 
than by Mr. Tracy in his " Psychology of Child- 
hood." The thesis is not, indeed, fundamentally 
a study, but rather a compilation of what has 
been discovered relating to the subject ; still, it 
is also a substantial contribution to knowledge. 
Particular attention is paid to the subject of 
language, and not the least valuable feature of 
the book is its bibliography relating to that 
topic. Besides fifteen unpublished studies that 
the author used, he gives one hundred and one 
titles of printed documents, making much the 
best list with which we are acquainted. 

The publication by the same house in the 
same year of translations of Herbart's " Science 
of Education " and Lange's " Apperception " 
testifies to the growing interest in the pedagog- 
ical ideas that Herbart organized into the sys- 
tem that bears his name. Beginning with the 
postulate that ethics furnishes the end of edu- 
cation and instruction the means, these ideas 
are both too many and too important to be dis- 
cussed in this place, beyond the offering of two 
or three reflections. And first, both pedagog- 
ists and practical teachers, when new ideas are 



brought before them, or old ideas in a new and 
striking way, exemplify the tendency to over- 
emphasis. It may be difficult to over- value such 
factors in education as interest and appercep- 
tion, but it is not impossible. The German phil- 
osopher no doubt gave to these two factors a new 
and a well-deserved value, but he did not dis- 
cover them. Neither do they render simple 
and easy even those parts of training to which 
they directly relate. It will not answer to fol- 
low the criterion of interest, absolutely, in mat- 
ters of education. It is often purely factitious, 
and is by no means difficult of creation. Again, 
if Herbart over-emphasizes the teacher, he etrs 
on the safe side. Instruction is indeed the com- 
plement of experience and intercourse. " Who 
can dispense with experience and intercourse in 
education ? " asks Herbart. " To do so would 
be to dispense with daylight and content our- 
selves with candlelight. Fulness, strength, in- 
dividual definiteness in all our presentations, 
practice in the application of the general, con- 
tact with the real, with the country and the 
age, patience with men as they are, all these 
must be derived from those original sources of 
mental life." Still, they are inadequate. " The 
kernel of our mental being," he continues, "can- 
not be cultivated with certain results by means 
of experience and intercourse. Instruction most 
certainly penetrates deeper into the laboratory 
of the mind. Only think of the power of every 
religious doctrine ! Think of the dominating 
influence which a philosophic lecture so easily, 
nay, almost unawares, exercises over an atten- 
tive listener. Add thereto the frightful power 
of novel-reading, for all this belongs to in- 
struction, either bad or good. . . . Instruction 
alone can lay claim to cultivate a balanced all- 
embracing many-sidedness." Dr. Harris justly 
remarks, in the preface of the book next to be 
mentioned, " a correct method is very important 
in higher education ; it is indispensable in pri- 
mary education." It is all right, indeed abso- 
lutely necessary, to lay stress on scholarship in 
selecting a college professor, but it is unsafe 
to forget, as some do, that there is a teaching 
art. There can be little doubt that at present 
the teaching found in the best public schools, 
as a whole, is much better than that found in 
colleges of the same grade of standing. To- 
gether with Herbart's " Text Book in Psychol- 
ogy," which appeared in the "International 
Series " three years ago, these books furnish 
an excellent outline of the Herbartian system, 
by its authoritative expounders.

bolical Education " shows that it is a contribu- 
tion to the steadily increasing volume of kin- 
dergarten literature. To appreciate some of the 
author's names and headings requires something 
of that transcendental talent which abounded in 
Froebel. However, the leading ideas are clearly 
and forcibly put. Probably many readers will 
wonder what " vortical education " can be, and 
we fear that in some cases the feeling will sur- 
vive a reading of the chapter that bears that 
name. Still, we find here such paragraphs as 
this : " Many mothers live for their children ; 
fewer live with their children ; fewer still per- 
mit their children to live with them. Yet noth- 
ing is more certain than that doing for chil- 
dren when dissociated from living with them 
breeds selfishness and fails to awaken love. Hu- 
man hearts can be knit together only by com- 
mon experiences and sympathies, and every 
mother would do well to adopt as her motto 
the words of Luther : ' God, that he might 
draw man to him, became man ; we, if we would 
draw children to us, must become children.' " 
The chapter called " Atomism " is a vigorous 
criticism of Rousseau's central ideas. Deserved 
stress is laid on the idea of " Member-whole " 
(^Gleidganzes*), which the editor calls the deep- 
est and most fruitful in the philosophy of edu- 
cation. Dr. Harris opens his preface with 
some statistics showing the progress that the 
kindergarten is making. Since 1872 the kin- 
dergartens in this country have increased from 
42 to 3000, the teachers from 73 to 5000, and 
the pupils from 1252 to 100,000. Still, we see 
no reason to swerve from the opinion that Froe- 
bel's ideas, in the long run, will influence educa- 
tion far more indirectly through the primary 
school than directly through the kindergarten. 
Few Americans now living have had an 
equal educational experience with Dr. E. E. 
White. He has taught in every grade of 
school from the bottom to the top of the scale, 
has served as a school superintendent and a 
college president, and has lectured to tens of 
thousands of teachers in institutes and summer 
schools. He was also for many years the editor 
of a widely and favorably known educational 
journal, and has reflected patiently and clearly 
on educational problems. Besides these qual- 
ities, he is also master of a clear and direct lit- 
erary style, and of rich sources of illustration. 
No man whom we can recall is so well fitted as 
he to write such a book as " School Manage- 
ment." Very naturally, and also very properly, 
the standpoint of the book is that of the au- 
thor's personal experience, observation, and 



study. In the best sense, it is a " practical 
book for teachers, and all other persons inter- 
ested in the right training of the young." We 
are confident that there is no better book of 
the kind extant. Nearly two-thirds of the mat- 
ter is found in the chapter entitled " Moral 
Instruction." The author is evidently in ac- 
cord with the opinion expressed by Dr. Bain : 
" The difficulties of moral teaching exceed in 
every way the difficulties of intellectual teach- 
ing. The method of proceeding is hampered 
by so many conditions, that it barely admits of 
precise demonstration or statement." This chap- 
ter will furnish the practical teacher, and the 
parent also, with more real practical help than 
any other similar discussion known to us. Dr. 
White has a firm grasp of the problems of will- 
training and of motive. He declares in his 
preface that " the two most obstructive foes of 
needed progress in school training are artift- 
cialism in motive and mechanism in method." 
There is also a chapter entitled " Religion in 
the School." The book deserves the wide cir- 
culation that it is sure to command. Its timely 
appearance is proof that the new devotion to 
the science of education will not obscure teach- 
ing and school management as practical arts.

THE ADVANCE IN EXPERIMENTAL. 
PSYCHOLOGY.* 



It is a lamentable fact that there exists in 
English no adequate text-book of experimental 
psychology. Although every important seat 
of learning in the country possesses its psycho- 
logical laboratory, and although there is con- 
siderable uniformity of doctrine in modern 
psychology, far more than could have been 
expected, seeing that the science is not half 
a century old, yet the extant text-books are 
almost as individual and arbitrary in selection 
and interpretation of facts as were the pre- 
scientific manuals, from Aristotle to Herbart. 
Dr. Kiilpe's book, the work of a pupil of 
Wundt and Miiller, should find a translator ; it 
is the best in the field. The worst that can be 
said of it is, that its author is too original a 
psychologist to be content with simple tran- 
scription and resumption : he cannot resist the 
temptation of making, here and there, positive 
contributions to our psychological knowledge. 

Modern psychologists, almost without excep-

tion, follow Wundt in dividing up the subject- 
matter of psychology into description and theory 
of elements, and description and theory of com- 
pounds. Description means here what it means 
in the natural sciences. By theory is meant 
the giving of the conditions, psychical and 
physical, under which a particular state or pro- 
cess of consciousness comes into being. The ele- 
ments of mind are, possibly, three : sensation, 
affection (pleasure -pain), conation (effort). 
Some psychologists (Miinsterberg) seek to re- 
duce these to one : sensation. Others posit all 
three (Ladd) ; while others, again, regard sen- 
sation and conation as underivative, and treat 
of affection as an attribute of sensation, ap- 
pearing under certain circumstances (Wundt). 
For Dr. Kiilpe the elementary processes are 
those of sensation and affection, " effort " be- 
ing regarded as a complex of sensible qualities, 
and " will " (e. g., in attention) as an inference 
from the phenomena of mental inhibition. 
" Will " is not given in experience ; it is the 
supposed psychical cause of these facts of in- 
hibition, which is hypostatised, and then intro- 
duced into experience. 

It must not be imagined that the psycholo- 
gist chooses his " elements " at random. The 
difficulty of decision points simply to the dif- 
ficulty of introspective analysis ; and this will 
grow less and less, as the methodology of the 
science is perfected. The radicalness of sen- 
sation is not disputed. That of pleasure and 
pain is arguable, but can, I think, be demon- 
strated. The existence of a separate conative 
process it is at present impossible either to prove 
or to disprove. Only we may be certain of one 
thing : that the final appeal must be, not to un- 
trained self-observation, but to experiment ; to 
controlled and repeated self -observation. If we 
find any set of experimental results, which can- 
not be adequately interpreted in terms of sensa- 
tion and pleasure-pain alone, we are justified in 
assuming the influence of a third process, which 
crosses and modifies these. Such results would 
be, e. g., those of recent investigations into the 
so-called time-sense, or into the " oscillations 
of attention." It is here, and among similar 
facts, that the criterion must be looked for ; and 
there is no reason to despair of its discovery. 

Of the 470 pages of his Grundriss, Dr. 
Kiilpe devotes 250 to the elements of mind, 
150 to their simpler and less permanent com- 
binations, and the rest to conscious " states " 
(attention, self-consciousness, sleep, hypnosis, 
etc.) Of the 250, sensation claims 200 : its 
consideration, i. e., occupies much less than 



half the book. And in this are included a long 
and masterly exposition of the psychophysical 
measurement methods, and a very original and 
thorough-going discussion of reproduction and 
association. It can never again, then, be made 
a reproach to experimental psychology, that it 
is incompetent to handle anything else than sen- 
sation. And yet why should the preponderance 
of the treatment of sensation, in a scientific 
psychology, be in itself a matter for reproach ? 
There are from fifty to a hundred thousand irre- 
ducible qualities of sensation : there are at best 
but two qualities of affection, and one of cona- 
tion. And even when sensations are grouped 
under modalities, by reference to the various 
sense-organs, we have qualities from those of 
sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch (skin and 
articular surface), temperature, strain (ten- 
dons), fatigue (muscle), equilibrium (semi- 
circular canals), and from the internal organs 
of the body. So that less must always be said 
of affection and conation than is said of sensa- 
tion : they have fewer qualities, of which any- 
thing can be said. The current objection ap- 
plies only to that pseudo-psychology which is 
based upon sensation statistics. These, it is 
true, can never supply trustworthy inferences 
for individual psychology. Le chiffre, c'est un 
grand mensonge is, perhaps, truer here than it 
was in its original connexion. 

The author distinguishes two forms of the 
combination of mental elements : the fusion 
and the association. In the former occurs a 
blending of the intensive and qualitative aspects 
of conscious content ; in the latter, an approxi- 
mation of their temporal or spatial attributes. 
The fusion is different from any of its constit- 
uents ; a new, total process overshadows the 
original, component processes (e. g., a chord 
in music). In the association, on the contrary, 
the primary factors become even more distinct 
than they were in their previous state of isola- 
tion (cf. the contrast of colors upon a playing 
card). Emotion and impulse are thus analyzed 
as fusions ; our space-constructions and volun- 
tary actions as associations. The distinction 
promises to become fundamental in future psy- 
chologies. Dr. Kiilpe's treatment is necessar- 
ily condensed, but none the less clear and con- 
tinuous. 

The book is not " easy reading," even for 
the comparatively advanced student ; but it will 
amply repay labor spent upon it. It is well 
printed, and contains a good index in addition 
to the table of contents.

STUDIES ix SOCIAL SCIENCE.* 



With exaggerated optimism, Mr. W. H. Mallock, 
in writing of " Labour and the Popular Welfare," 
attempts to brush away all efforts for a fairer dis- 
tribution of wealth. He claims that rent secures 
in Great Britain only two and one-fourth per cent 
of the national income ; whereas Mr. Giffin's figures, 
on which Mr. Mallock's estimate is based, giving 
65,039,000 as the total income of lands, are entirely 
misleading. " Lands " in the British income-tax 
include farm-houses, but not urban land or railroad 
or mineral or forest lands, which far exceed the 
value of agricultural land. Mr. Mallock further 
arouses suspicion by all manner of calculations as 
to how little of wealth would be each one's share 
on an equal " divvy," and how difficult or impossible 
it would be to divide equally among a million peo- 
ple some costly mantle or carpet in the palace of a 
duke. Because the much greater annual product 
per capita to-day over a century ago can be ascribed 
to brain-power and the growth of capital, more than 
to increased efficiency of manual labor, the author 
endorses, with some exceptions, the general propo- 
sition that all the results of past ability should of 
right be the monopoly of living ability, though he 
holds that, in fact, labor is securing a larger and 
larger proportion of the product. This conclusion 
radically differs from that of the best American 
authority on the subject, Mr. Holmes of the U. S. 
Mortgage Census, who in the December number of 
the "Political Science Quarterly" estimates that 
nine per cent of our population own seventy-one per 
cent of our country's wealth, and 3-100 of one per 
cent, or 4,097 families, own one-fifth of it, or seven- 
tenths as much as 11,593,887 families. And accord- 
ing to the same authority, this inequality is much 
greater than it was twenty and forty years ago. 

In marked contrast with Mallock's book is that 
on " The Labor Movement," by Mr. L. T. Hob- 
house, an M.A., and Fellow of Merton College, Ox- 
ford. Writing from the standpoint of the mod- 
erate Fabian Socialists, and at the same time being 
well read in Marshall and other recent economists, 
Mr. Hobhouse presents the most reasonable discus- 
sion of trades unions, cooperation, and gradual ex- 
tension of societary action, that has yet appeared

from the Fabian standpoint. Nothing is said of 
Karl Marx's exploded theory of surplus value ; and 
where any really great changes in industrial organ- 
ization are advocated, their full realization is con- 
sidered so distant and their precise form so uncer- 
tain, while the justice underlying the proposed 
changes is so strongly presented, as to disarm much 
criticism. How far a better educated society than 
ours will be able to work out the suggestions of the 
Fabians, depends much on the extent to which am- 
bition for social honor, place, and difference of sal- 
ary, will equal in motive force the profit-making 
ambition of present business. We may not all be 
so confident on this point as Mr. Hobhouse, but we 
cannot fail to be stimulated by his treatment of it. 
A brief quotation or two will show his point of 
view. He does not favor the poor because of su- 
perior worth, but because of greater need. Admit- 
ting that improved environment is only an antece- 
dent condition for the development of moral forces, 
and does not of necessity produce such improved 
morality, he says: 

" There is no spite in the Labor movement of to-day, 
but there is a strong sense of the poverty and misery 
around us, and a clear conviction that a better use might 
be made of our enormous wealth. We have no wish 
to send the rich empty away, but, cost what it may, we 
are determined to fill the hungry with some of the good 
things of life. . . . Collective control has not so much 
to make people good and happy, as to establish the 
necessary conditions of goodness and happiness, leaving 
it to individual effort and voluntary association to de- 
velop freely and spontaneously all the fair flower and 
fruit of human intercourse and knowledge and beauty 
which can spring from a sound root firmly planted in 
life-giving earth." 

The work on the growth and outcome of Social- 
ism, by the well-known writers Mr. William Morris 
and Mr. E. B. Bax, is most disappointing. Its 
historical part lacks in judicial and philosophical 
breadth and candor. The present private owner- 
ship of capital and land is treated as a conspiracy, 
against which even violence is not blameworthy, 
rather than as an historical evolution whose work 
is certainly not yet accomplished, however great 
may be some of its evils. At least until a new so- 
cial conscience and a far greater intelligence among 
the people are developed, all true students must 
agree that such private ownership is a necessity. 
Our authors appear to rejoice at the passage by the 
Commune of "enactments of a distinctly socialistic 
nature, involving the suspension of contracts, aboli- 
tion of rents, and confiscation of the means of pro- 
duction " ; while the destruction of the Column 
Vendome, "that base piece of Napoleonic uphol- 
stery," is spoken of as " another mark of the deter- 
mination to hold no parley with the old jingo 
legends." The surplus-value theory of Marx, over- 
thrown by Boehm-Bawerk and others before him, 
and no longer insisted on by many Fabian Social- 
ists, is endorsed here. The authors present many 
suggestions and ideals for the future. A gradual

evolution, with possibly some degree of violence at 
a late stage, will, it is thought, practically eradicate 
our capitalistic system. Our present national gov- 
ernment will largely disappear ; instead will come 
a universal federative State, in which industry will 
be conducted by villages or cities and by trade asso- 
ciations. Our authors appear at their best when 
outlining the past and future of art and the mission 
of machinery pages presumably written in large 
part by the artist-poet Morris. 

The growing power of women in the domain of 
social science is well illustrated in the fact that they 
are the authors of four of the seven books included 
in the present review. In "Industrial Arbitration 
and Conciliation," Mrs. Lowell, after briefly sum- 
marizing the work of the famous boards of concil- 
iation and arbitration in the North of England, gives 
for the first time, in English at least, an account of 
a successful experiment of the same kind among 
the ignorant and poorly-paid miners of Belgium, in 
the collieries of Bascoup and Mariemont. Where 
success lias been attained in these methods of in- 
dustrial peace, it is shown to be largely due to the 
readiness of the employer to deal considerately, and 
on terms of equality, with committees of his men 
and of labor organizations. The most valuable part 
of the book for Americans is the clear account of the 
formation and working of the system of conciliation 
and yearly contracts between organizations of em- 
ployers and of men in some of the building trades of 
New York, Boston, and Chicago, where employers 
have found it decidedly to their interest to recognize 
the unions, to employ none but union men at eight 
and nine hours a day, and have yearly contracts and 
standing committees of conference and conciliation 
with the representatives of the unions. Even where 
the contractors felt justified in crushing a certain 
union in New York because of its alleged arbitrary 
character, they at once helped reorganize it. Mrs. 
Lowell should get out a new edition of her work, 
incorporating studies of the Massachusetts and New 
York boards of arbitration, such as she in part at- 
tempted in her paper before the American Social 
Science Association in 1891. The remarkable his- 
tory of conciliation in the Ohio and Western Penn- 
sylvania coal fields, which the reviewer once tried 
to cover for its first three years up to 1889, should 
also be included and brought down to date. Un- 
fortunately, the best-known example hitherto of con- 
cilation in America the arrangement of the slid- 
ing-scale in steel and iron work has been greatly 
shattered by the weakness of the Amalgamated As- 
sociation and the arbitrary action of the Carnegie 
Company at Homestead. 

Mrs. Helen Campbell has drawn from the little- 
read reports of our various bureaus of labor statis- 
tics, and from other original sources, a vivid account 
of " Women Wage-Earners " in America. In a new 
edition, which we understand she contemplates issu- 
ing, we hope she may not only incorporate the fig- 
ures on the subject, now just appearing, of the cen- 



sus of 1890, but may add the little that can be 
gathered of facts about women in our trades-unions, 
and may also consider the optimistic side of wo- 
men's work brought out by Miss Katherine Coman 
of Wellesley before the Labor Congress in Chicago 
last summer. 

Miss Balch has given us an excellent summary 
of the history and principles underlying the relief 
of the unemployed and needy in France, which is 
especially timely just now. Two principles every- 
where appear in French poor-relief. One is the lack 
of recognition of any duty by society to provide for 
the pauper class. The state department and com- 
mune largely aid private charities, but are not dis- 
turbed as they would be, in theory at least, in England 
and America, in case no provision whatever for pau- 
perism should exist in hundreds of communes, or in- 
adequate provision in others. The second principle 
is the strict control by the state and minor public bod- 
ies of all private charity. All are supervised by pub- 
lic officials ; and without their consent no money can 
be collected, even in churches, for charitable pur- 
poses. Although there appear to be fewer paupers in 
France than in England, it cannot with any certainty 
be ascribed to this system of relief. French thrift 
a racial characteristic, stimulated by admirable 
school and postal savings-banks and public pawn- 
shops, briefly touched upon in this monograph 
seem more responsible. In fact, there has of late 
in France been some approach to the English sys- 
tem ; but that amusing terror over any socialistic 
measures, which is the outcome of so many revolu- 
tions, and, as Professor Gide has shown, has bound 
nearly all French economists hard and fast to the 
car of extreme conservatism, operates also to prevent 
recognition of any duty of the state to the poor. 
Although Miss Balch does not make the comment, 
it seems as if the very refusal of the state to actually 
undertake much poor-relief is driving it into a greater 
interference with real liberty, through its resulting 
control of private philanthrophy, than would follow 
from the nominally mere socialistic English and 
American plan, however great the shortcomings in 
execution of this English system. 

Miss Julie Sutter, in "A Colony of Mercy, or 
Social Christianity at Work," has shown how Ger- 
many has well-nigh completely solved the problem 
of the proper care of both the professional tramp 
and of the far more important honest traveller in 
search of work. There are three parts to the Ger- 
man system : the Labor Colonies, of which there 
are now twenty-six ; the Relief Stations, of which 
there are two thousand ; and the Homes, of which 
there are four hundred. Pastor von Bodelschwingh, 
the hero of Miss Sutter's book, was chiefly con- 
cerned in developing the Labor Colonies by his 
wonderful success in the first of them at Bethel, 
near Bielefeld in Westphalia. Started in 1867 as 
a home for epileptics, other features were from 
time to time added. The Labor Colony, called 
Wilhelmsdorf named for the then Crown Prince,

Frederick William was started in 1882, to reclaim 
to honest livelihood the submerged population of 
the district. No one is allowed to stay in any one 
colony more than a year and eleven months, and 
may leave at any time, with the right to draw 
through the postoffice, at any safe distance from any 
outlying saloons, the small earnings allowed besides 
board. He needs no money immediately, thanks 
to the Relief Stations, as he can tramp all over 
Germany without a penny in his pocket, if hon- 
estly in search of work. By no means all are re- 
claimed, but military discipline and the industrious 
habits required at the Colony work wonderful re- 
sults. Bodelschwingh showed the magistrates of the 
province that under favorable conditions economy 
pointed toward the providing of work for the beg- 
gar, instead of letting him prey upon the people. A 
grant was made by the province, and the success 
of the venture was so far proved that each of the 
other twenty-five colonies, started by private action, 
has received grants from the province upon organ- 
ization, and subsidies, as there is need. Much is 
done by private effort and contribution, but public 
reports are rendered annually, and the colonies are 
to all intent public organizations. This state aid 
and supervision is claimed to be one element of their 
great success. Ten thousand unemployed pass 
through them yearly. An outgrowth of this work, 
the Natural- Verpflegungs Station, or Relief Station, 
must be referred to. They extend all over the land, 
but a half -day's journey apart, where the tramp or 
unemployed may stay one night, working a half- 
day for his lodging and meals. He then must pass 
to the next station, first having his name recorded 
in a book, or receiving a vagrancy certificate, which 
he carries. Each station is an employment agency 
for its own district, and the probability is that un- 
less he be a willing idler he will find some work in 
the course of his tramp. If he is proved an invet- 
erate tramp, the workhouse is likely to receive him 
at last. These stations partly support themselves 
by work done, the deficiency being supplied by the 
district, all realizing that " it is cheaper to aid your 
beggar than to let him beg." Eight thousand on 
the average stay in these Stations every night. A 
still more advanced form of help is the Herberge 
zur Heimath, or Homes, where the journeyman ar- 
tisan, travelling for work, may lodge at lowest pos- 
sible rates. These Homes are not forms of parish 
relief, as are the others, but rather are efforts to 
supply food and lodging to the recipient at mere 
cost, and also to furnish for resident workmen in 
the neighborhood a chance to smoke, buy a single 
glass of beer if sober, and secure the light and com- 
panionship which in America are only to be found 
in the saloon. The 13,000 beds in these places are 
always full, the price for meals and lodging being 
thirty-six cents a day. Miss Sutter strongly em- 
phasizes throughout the work that the Labor Col- 
ony, and nearly all of the many other lines of work 
carried on at Bethel, which unfortunately cannot 
be touched upon here, owe their success and wide- 



spread influence primarily to the wonderful self- 
devotion of Pastor von Bodelschwingh, united to 
his remarkable ability as a financier and business 
manager ; and she is convinced that no such work 
could hope for similar success without some such 
strong personality at the helm. This country bids 
fair to discover before long that the same spirit has 
been working quietly, and is making itself widely 
felt in such work as is being done at Hull House 
and a few other such settlements. Miss Suiter's 
book is fascinating in interest, and most valuable 
in suggestion to all students of the problem of the 
unemployed. EDWARD W. BEMIS. 



BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS. 



The Schoolmmter Two neatly - printed volumes, both 
in Literature, and by the same author and publishers 
Folklore studies. (American Book Company), are 
worthy of being commended to the attention of the 
teacher and the general reader. The one is en- 
titled "The Schoolmaster in Literature," and con- 
tains choice selections from the writings of Ascham, 
Moliere, Fuller, Rousseau, Shenstone, Goethe, Cow- 
per, Pestalozzi, Page, Mitford, Bronte", Hughes,. 
Dickens, Thackeray, Irving, George Eliot, and 
others, with an introduction by Dr. Edward Eggles- 
ton. The compilation is made to show " the part 
played by the schoolmaster in the literature of di- 
verse ages and of different nations." As stated by 
Dr. Eggleston, " it is quite worth while to take the 
ideal of a good schoolmaster constructed by quaint 
old Thomas Fuller, and put it alongside the Blim- 
bers, and to place Shenstone's village school, 

' Where sits the dame disguised in look profound, 
And eyes her fairy throng and turns her wheel around,' 

in juxtaposition with the immaculate Miss Pinker- 
ton's most respectable seat of learning in Chiswick 
Mall, or with quaint old Bartle Mussey's night- 
school for full-grown men." Teachers' reading- 
circles will find an abundance of amusement and 
instruction in this work. The other volume is- 
" Readings in Folk-lore," being a series of short 
studies on the mythology of America, Great Brit- 
ain, the Norse countries, Germany, India, Syria,. 
Egypt, and Persia, with selections from standard 
literature relating thereto. The author, Mr. Hubert 
M. Skinner, has given in this work a very fair con- 
ception of the mythology and folk-lore of the va- 
rious peoples mentioned. The meaning of mythology 
and folk-lore is presented with fulness and accuracy, 
and the selections show to what use these things 
can be put by the poet. The selection has been 
made with excellent judgment. Mr. Skinner some- 
times goes astray in orthography as when he writes 
Frigga for Frigg, the wife of Odin, Hela for Hel,. 
the goddess of death ; but in such things many emi- 
nent writers have stumbled, and the blemishes are 
not of a kind to mar the work materially. Correc- 
tions should, however, be made in a new edition.

The life of Joseph E. Johnston, by 

* obert M ' Hu S hes > in the "Great 
Commanders series (Appleton ), 
may serve a useful purpose in removing the impres- 
sion, which the general history of the Civil War is 
apt to produce, that Johnston was an unsuccessful 
commander ; an estimate as unjust as that which 
would place him on a level with Washington, Grant, 
Thomas, or Lee. Like McClellan, Johnston was a 
good organizer; but as a general in the field it is 
doubtful if he was in any way great. Like Mc- 
Clellan, he seems never to have thought he had 
forces enough to do what he was set to do ; although 
it must be confessed that he estimated the forces 
opposed to him more accurately than McClellan was 
usually able to do. General Johnston was careful, 
however, of such forces as he commanded ; and 
this may account for the caution of Sherman while 
conducting operations against him. But if John- 
ston was not a great general, he always proved him- 
self a good soldier ; his plans seem to have been 
well formed, and based on correct theories of strat- 
egy. He deserves the credit of winning the first 
battle of Manassas if, indeed, that fight can be truly 
called a victory for the Confederates, who were left 
in possession of the field. His conduct of the re- 
treat up the Peninsular, and of the battle of Seven 
Pines to the moment of his being wounded and 
forced to relinquish the command, was such as per- 
haps to justify his biographer in claiming that had 
he continued in command he would have scored a 
substantial triumph. As regards the part played by 
Johnston in the Vicksburg campaign, it should be 
remarked that the forces he controlled were too few 
to enable him to accomplish any substantial result, 
and Pemberton's disobedience prevented the saving 
of the army he commanded, which would probably 
have been effected had Johnston's directions been 
followed. The conduct of the retreat from Dalton 
to Atlanta seems to be the achievement on which 
General Johnston's reputation as a military leader 
must always chiefly rest. In reading Mr. Hughes's 
account of this exploit, one cannot help feeling that 
not one movement made by the Confederate army 
was wrong, and that every movement was managed 
with great skill ; yet General Hood, who relieved 
General Johnston, in his book, " Advance and Re- 
treat," claims with considerable force that the con- 
stant withdrawal from before the enemy demoralized 
the Confederates, and was more injurious than the 
loss of many lives would have been. The reader 
cannot fail to admire the personal character of Gen- 
eral Johnston. He served the cause he had espoused 
faithfully and zealously ; he was able to bear injus- 
tice and slights with dignity and patience, and in 
the end to accept the results of the war with good 
faith and resignation, and to serve his reunited 
country with credit to her and to himself, winning 
the respect and confidence of his late adversaries, 
and holding the love and confidence of his state and 
section to the end of a long and useful life. 



The nth century Mr - Henry Offley Wakeman has 
in European dealt with the fifth of the eight " Pe- 

riods of European History" (Mac- 
millan) to be covered by the series of volumes which 
Mr. Arthur Hassall is now editing. Mr. Wake- 
man's period is, roughly, the seventeenth century ; 
exactly, the years 1598-1715. It is " the period 
when Europe, shattered in its political and religious 
ideas by the Reformation, reconstructed its political 
system upon the principle of territorialism under 
the rule of absolute monarchs. It opens with Henry 
IV., it closes with Peter the Great. It is, therefore, 
the century in which the principal European States 
took the form and acquired the position in Europe 
which they have held more or less up to the present 
time. A century in which France takes the lead 
in European affairs, and enters on a course of em- 
bittered rivalry with Germany, in which England 
assumes a position of first importance in the affairs of 
Europe, in which the Emperor, ousted from all effect- 
ive control over German politics, finds the true cen- 
tre of his power on the Danube, in which Prussia 
becomes the dominant state in north Germany, in 
which Russia begins to drive in the Turkish outposts 
on the Pruth and the Euxine a century, in short, 
which saw the birth of the Franco-German Question 
and of the Eastern Question." This passage from 
the opening chapter shows the main lines upon which 
Mr. Wakeman has dealt with the subject. He has 
left out some things, such as " Portugal and the Pa- 
pacy, the internal affairs of Spain, Italy, and Russia.'* 
It must also be remembered that the history of En- 
gland enters only incidentally into the plan of the 
series to which this volume belongs. The develop- 
ment of the French monarchy is naturally the cen- 
tral subject of the work. The style is pleasing, and 
the book more readable than manuals of such com- 
pactness are likely to be. The author's judgments 
are now and then open to question, as when he 
gives Turgot less credit as a minister of finance than 
is accorded to Sully or Colbert, or when he makes 
the statement that the monarchies of Europe are 
now as absolute as they were in the seventeenth cen- 
tury. This statement is really extraordinary. 



Child-life 
in Japan. 



"The Wee Ones of Japan" (Har- 
per), by Mae St. John Brain hall, is 
principally, if not entirely, a reprint 
of a series of articles recently published in " Har- 
per's Bazaar." The subject is written up, with the 
exception of an occasional "gush," in a charming 
way ; and is finely illustrated by Mr. C. D. Weldon, 
with typical Japanese pictures. The work is marred 
by errors, mostly typographical, in the translitera- 
tion of Japanese words. But, in spite of these mi- 
nor faults, the book is interesting ; and, though it 
gives nothing specially new, it shows that the author 
has gained a clear insight into the life and spirit of 
Japanese children. Having " omitted all mention 
of the ' made-over ' Japanese child " with knee- 
breeches, shoes, stockings, etc., the author succeeds

[May 16, 



A volume 
of sprightly 
essays. 



in giving a good picture of the child-life of old Japan. 
The five chapters, extending over 136 pages, tell 
of the indoor and outdoor games and sports of Japa- 
nese children ; of the family life, with its " sternest 
discipline and frolicsome joyousness "; of the physi- 
cal appearance, the dress, the diet, the mental and 
moral training of the hoys and girls ; of their recre- 
ations, such as theatre-going, card-playing ( more in- 
structive than amusing, like our "Authors," " Logo- 
machy," etc.), temple-outings, feasts of flowers (each 
in its season) ; of the Feast of Dolls (for girls only) ; 
of the Feast of Flags (for boys only) ; of the New 
Year's festivities for all, even children of a larger 
growth ; and of the ceremonial and hereditary po- 
liteness in private and in public. There are also 
interesting digressions with reference to the be- 
loved Empress, who, childless, is the kind mother 
of 41,000,000 people, and the sympathizing helper 
especially of the 20,000,000 and more of women of 
that land ; and to the law and ethics (if there were 
any) of the married state, which, so far as the woman 
is concerned, is appropriately called, not " wedlock," 

but " padlock." 

In the style of sprightly allusiveness 
made familiar of late by the essays 
of Mr. Lang, Mr. Birrell, and Mr. 
Stevenson, are the papers included by Mr. W. P. 
James in his volume of "Romantic Professions" 
(Macmillan). These eight essays, which are re- 
printed magazine articles, are remarkable for finish 
and point ; their writer has a sort of genius for style, 
and there is not a dull page in his book. For the 
rest, they are the kind of thing that may be pro- 
duced by any man who will keep a note-book, and, 
when enough instances have accumulated under 
some particular head, will take the pains to serve 
up his facts in an attractive way, seasoning them 
with satire, sentiment, and wit. It must be admit- 
ted that Mr. James does the seasoning unusually 
well. A pleasant example of the author's manner 
is this opening paragraph from the closing essay : 
" A writer in the ' Daily News,' for reasons of his 
own, entered a protest lately against what he called 
the Magnum Opus theory. A man's friends and 
acquaintances, he complained, were continually urg- 
ing him to write a Great Work. It was in vain 
that the victim protested that he did not want to 
write a Great Work ; or that he had written a Great 
Work which nobody ever heard of ; or that he 
could not live (in this mortal state) by a Great 
Work, and must produce things which would yield 
him his daily bread. He might have added that 
if he did write one, the very last to read it would 
be these same monitors." 

We have had collections of French, 
? talian > G erma n, and Dutch humor 
in the " Humour " series (Scribner), 
and have read them with an occasional gleam of 
intelligence, but predominated by the feeling always 
experienced by the uninitiated in the presence of 
work that is clearly esoteric in its appeal. Neither 



the humor nor the lyric poetry of one race can ever 
be successfully put into the language of another. The 
only way to get at them, to pluck out the heart of 
their mystery, is to read one's self into the languages 
to which they belong, and view them in the light 
of the body of associations that cluster about those 
languages. A volume of " American Humour " has 
just been prepared for this series by Mr. James 
Barr, and here, at least, the American reader may 
feel at home. The selection is a good one, for it 
minimizes the newspaper variety of our native hu- 
mor that stands for the species with many innocent 
persons, and gives us good examples from such men 
as Saxe, Lowell, Irving, "Artemas Ward," and 
Benjamin Franklin. Even Hawthorne figures in 
the collection, and, after the first shock is over, we 
must recognize the distinctly humorous quality of 
Mr. Higginbotham's " Catastrophe," the piece chosen 
to represent our most serious writer and greatest 
literary artist. Among living humorists, we have 
good examples from Messrs. Harte, Clemens, War- 
ner, Bunner, Aldrich, Howells, Cable, and Holmes. 
There is also a really useful bibliographical index, 
the first dictionary of American humorists (as far 
as we know) that has ever been made. It includes 
nearly two hundred writers ( many more than are 
represented by selections), among them such unex- 
pected names as those of Major Andre", President 
John Quincy Adams, Mather Byles, Mr. Chauncey 
Depew, and Thomas Morton "of Clifford's Inne, 
gent," upon the strength of his ridicule of the Puri- 
tans ! A few Canadians are included in this index. 

Selections ^ r> William Lyon Phelps, to whose 

from Gray, caref ul study of the English Roman- 

prose and verse. tic Movement we called attention a 
few weeks ago, has edited for the " Athenaeum 
Press " series (Ginn) a volume of selections from 
Gray, in both prose and verse. He gives as an 
excuse for this edition the fact that Gray's prose 
and verse are not commonly found in one volume ; 
but still better reasons are provided by the carefully- 
edited text (which is " closer to the original editions 
than anything published since Gray's death "), by 
the exposure of some more of Mr. Gosse's blunders, 
by the study of Gray's literary development, and by 
the helpful body of annotations. In his introduc- 
tion, Mr. Phelps opposes Arnold's theory of Gray's 
sterility, and accounts for the fact in a more com- 
monplace but more convincing way. " Gray was a 
scholar, devoted to solitary research, and severely 
critical ; this kind of temperament is not primarily 
creative, and does not toss off immortal poems every 
few weeks." But possibly the prosaic spirit of the 
age had something to do with it also. An interest- 
ing chapter of the book is contributed by Professor 
G. L. Kittredge, who discusses " Gray's Knowledge 
of Old Norse," and incidentally shows that Mr. 
Gosse is weak in one of his own special strongholds. 
The statement of the latter that " The Fatal Sisters " 
and " The Descent of Odin " were translated direct 
from the Icelandic is shown to be entirely baseless.

THE DIAL 



311 



A transition Anyone first seeing the title of the 

period in the Rev. Dr. John H. Overton's " The 
English Church. English Church in the Nineteenth 
Century " (Longmans) would be apt to wonder why 
its author had not waited until the century had 
closed before attempting to write its history. And 
when, upon closer examination, it is revealed that 
this is a sketch of the English Church in the first 
third only of the present century, it would appear 
that the title was a misnomer. Be this as it may, 
the book has a peculiar mission to perform, some- 
what analogous to that of the historical books in 
the Apocryphas. And it fulfils this mission admir- 
ably, furnishing a detailed picture of a period hith- 
erto much slighted by historical writers. Dr. Overton 
not only emphasizes the importance of a knowledge 
of this period as necessary to a full appreciation of 
the lively times that followed in the Tractarian 
Movement, but he actually relieves his subject of 
much of its dulness. It must be admitted that his 
careful attention to men who are otherwise unknown 
gives to his work something of the character of a 
local history, and rather emphasizes the insularity 
of the English Church; still, the book comes op- 
portunely, and properly belongs on the same shelf 
with Dean Church's "Oxford Movement," Liddon's 
"Pusey," and Prothero's "Dean Stanley." 

The Memoirs of The lif e of William Nelson Pendle- 
Gen. Pendieton of ton, D.D., who was rector of Lati- 
the Southern Army. mer p ar i s h, Lexington, Va., both be- 
fore and after the war, a Brigadier-General C. S. A. 
and Chief of Artillery in the Army of Northern 
Virginia during that great struggle, and sometime 
professor in several institutions of learning, bears 
a striking resemblance to that of Leonidas Polk, 
Bishop and General, whose biography was recently 
reviewed in THE DIAL. The Memoirs of Pendie- 
ton (Lippincott), prepared by his daughter, Mrs. 
Lee, are more in the nature of family memoirs than 
is the biography of Polk. The point of view from 
which they are written is emphatically Southern, 
though undoubtedly the pictures given of the hor- 
rors of the war are accurate. A little more careful 
editing of documents might have been done in the 
interests of good English. It gives one something 
of a shock to find a learned Bishop writing, " It 
looks like it may be my duty" to do something 
which he names ; and a boy's remark, " I thought 
you was dead," might judiciously have been cor- 
rected before being put into cold print. 

The author of " The Adventures in 
Algiers of Matthew Dudgeon, Gent." 
(Longmans), a tale "now for the 
first time printed," shows a very pretty talent for 
drawing the long bow. The story of a man taken 
by Algerine pirates and sold into slavery in Morocco 
is not exactly a new one ; but the present writer 
has managed to furbish up the old theme accept- 
ably, and he has added a variation in the shape of 
the corresponding tales told by his supposed f ellow- 



A volume of 

astonishing 

adventures. 



captives a Kurd, a Spaniard, a German, a noble 
lady of Florence, etc. While hardly up to Miin- 
chausen in point of mendacity, Master Dudgeon 
nevertheless does pretty well, as the following may 
testify : " One thing occurred during the fight which 
I did then look upon as of evil omen : at a broadside 
which we both fired at the same instant, one of their 
shot met one of ours in mid-air, and in the encounter 
split in two pieces, one of which flew back upon our 
captain and killed him. Truly it was a marvellous 
chance that he should thus be slain by one of his 
own shot." A carper might suggest that the inci- 
dent itself was scarcely so "marvellous" as the eye- 
sight that followed it. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Completion of Macmillan's " Dryburgh Waverley " is 
now near at hand, twenty of the twenty-five volumes hav- 
ing been issued. The last five received by us are " Quen- 
tin Durward," " St. Ronan's Well," " Redgauntlet," 
" The Betrothed and Highland Widow," and that old- 
time favorite of all healthy youth, "The Talisman." 
Each of these volumes has its special set of original 
drawings, those of " The Talisman," for example, being 
ten in number, the work of Mr. Godfrey C. Hindley. 
They are unusually spirited, as befits the stirring scenes 
that they illustrate. This volume also contains some of 
the " Chronicles of the Canongate." 

" Mathematics for Common Schools " (Heath) is an 
arithmetical treatise by Mr. John H. Walsh. There 
are three parts, primary, intermediate, and higher, each 
in a distinct volume. The " higher " section of the work 
includes those elementary parts of algebra and geometry 
that educational opinion is more and more coming to de- 
mand should be included in the grammar school cur- 
riculum. In making room for this new matter, the au- 
thor does not seem to have missed anything essential, 
and his book is to be commended as being in the line of 
a much needed educational reform. 

" The Merry Wives of Windsor," with the Chandos 
portrait for a frontispiece, and " The Two Gentlemen 
of Verona," with an engraving of the bust in Stratford 
Church, have just been added to the " Temple " Shake- 
speare (Macmillan). A charming feature of each of 
these little volumes is a prefatory tribute to the poet, 
from some one of his early admirers. Ben Jonson and 
L. Digges are thus far represented. The prefaces and 
notes by Mr. Israel Gollancz strike the happy mean be- 
tween penurious reserve and exhaustive pedantry. 

Miss Julia Raymond Gingell has made a selection of 
" Aphorisms from the Writings of Herbert Spencer " 
(Appleton), w' ch appears prefaced by a fine portrait of 
the philosoph . Mr. Spencer's lumbering style can 
hardly be char cterized as aphoristic, and many of Miss 
GingelFs selections, such as " a man's character may be 
told by the company he keeps," are but bald expressions 
of commonplace thought. " Only by varied iteration can 
alien conceptions be forced on reluctant minds " is an 
" aphorism " which Mr. Spencer's writings abundantly 
and humorously illustrate. 

Un Cheval de Phidias " is one of the earliest writ- 
ings of M. Victor Cherbuliez, having been published 
somewhere in the sixties. It is a playful study of Greek

the form of a story, or at least of a series of causeries. 
Under the title " A Phidian Horse : Art and Archaeol- 
ogy on the Acropolis " (Wanamaker) the book has been 
translated by Mrs. Thomas Roberts, with the consent 
of the author. A series of photogravure illustrations 
add to its attractiveness. 

Under the title " Ausgewahlte Meisterwerke des Mit- 
telalters " (Heath) Miss Carla Wenckebach has edited 
a series of selections from the masterpieces of Middle 
High German literature. The selections are translated 
into modern German, in some cases by the editor. We 
have examples from the " Waltharilied," the " Nibelun- 
genlied," " Parzival," " Tristan und Isolde," " Das Nar- 
renschiff," "Das Volksbuch von Dr. Faust," and many 
other sources. The object of the work is to attract atten- 
tion to the originals and lead to their study. But the 
value of a book of mere translations appears to us ques- 
tionable. 

Mr. Frank M. Gibson's " The Amateur Telescopist's 
Handbook " (Longmans) is designed for possessors of 
instruments without equatorial mounting, and with the 
modest aperture of two or three inches. It does not 
conflict with Webb, for that manual is mainly designed 
for use with telescopes of higher powers. Mr. Gibson 
gives us, besides classified lists of celestial objects, a 
good many hints about the construction of telescopes 
and the precautions to be taken in their use. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, May 10, 1894. 

The Copyright questions touched upon in my last 
letter have brought me further information as to the 
working of the Act of 1891. A sufficient time has 
now passed to enable publishers generally to understand 
what methods of procedure to follow in securing them- 
selves and their authors here and abroad. Single stories, 
poems, and articles in English periodicals, which have 
not been " placed " in the United States, are now sent 
over in advance to this country, put in type, and issued 
in pamphlet form on the day of the periodical's publi- 
cation in England, thus securing copyright here for the 
same matter when subsequently issued in book form. 
It is becoming more and more dangerous to reprint such 
articles from English magazines, especially if the au- 
thors are distinguished. All this has, of course, become 
the a b c of the trade among publishers; but it will be 
in the nature of information to many of the writing 
guild. Such copyrighted matter as that just mentioned 
is published here in three different ways: first, by the 
American branch of the English house; second, by an 
American publishing house which is the agent of the 
English firm; third, by the private agent of the English 
publisher. In any case protection is legally secured. 

So thoroughly do the English houses understand this 
question, and in so many cases have they established 
branch firms here for the publication of their own books, 
that a leading Boston author was tempted to remark to 
the head of a large American publishing house that the 
chief effect of the International Copyright Act seemed 
to be to enable English publishing firms to establish 
branch houses here, manufacture duplicate plates, and 
flood the market with English books. This is only par- 
tially true, however, as most English publishers still 
prefer to issue their books through American houses, 
who manufacture the plates for both sides of the ocean. 

As to American authors, they no longer have to com- 



pete with five-cent editions of current books by leading 
English authors, but issue their works in even competi- 
tion with the latter. In view of the working of the 
Act, there may be a modicum of wisdom in requiring 
plates to be manufactured in this country, as otherwise 
we might be swamped by cheap English sheets in a way 
to shut off American authors and publishers from fair 
competition. These are the views of a protectionist, 
however, and I understand that those interested in copy- 
right reform insist that protection and free trade ought 
not to enter into the question. 

International Copyright is now secured between the 
United States and Great Britain, France, Germany, Bel- 
gium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy. x The Amer- 
ican Copyright League, so its secretary tells me, is 
now working for copyright with Greece, Norway and 
Sweden, Spain, and Austria. Russia is considered hope- 
less on account of the press-censorship. Austria, I be- 
lieve, objects to the printing clause. Oddly enough, 
the printing clause is not considered a grave objection 
by the Spanish authorities, but they do object seriously 
to the requirement that American editions of Spanish 
books be registered at Washington and the fee paid be- 
fore copyright can be secured. In most international 
copyright agreements between European countries, reg- 
istration in the author's country is all that is necessary 
for protection in other countries. Our late minister to 
Spain, the Hon. E. Burd Grubb, was unable to overcome 
this objection on the part of the Spanish authorities. It 
has been suggested that a certificate of copyright from 
the United States consul at Madrid, or from the Span- 
ish minister of foreign affairs, could be made to serve 
at Washington by a special act of Congress. The bene- 
fit would accrue chiefly to Spanish authors, so that Span- 
ish hindrance seems absurd. 

Congress, by the way, has passed the bill giving Li- 
brarian Spofford an increased clerical force in the Copy- 
right department, although the House reduced the ap- 
propriation $10,000, 1 think, it was one-third. This 
increase will be very helpful to Mr. Spofford, and he 
proposes to make it serve if possible. Business in the 
Copyright department had reached a point of arrears in 
which it required six months to reach and return the 
copyright certificates sent in by publishers. 

Among forthcoming books to be published by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. is " The Friendship of Nature," by 
Mabel Osgood Wright, a daughter of the late Dr. Samuel 
Osgood of New York, who exerted a wide influence in 
literary and scientific circles. Mrs. Wright's book has 
for its sub-title " A Chronicle of New England Birds 
and Flowers," and will appeal strongly to sentimental 
lovers of Nature. There will be an edition de luxe lim- 
ited to 250 copies. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons will issue on May 25 
the authorized translation of the Rev. Paul Sabatier's 
" Life of Saint Francis of Assissi," which has passed 
through several editions in Paris and created much 
talk in clerical circles. Alphonse Daudet has remarked 
of it that " for long, very long, nothing has moved me 
so deeply as this lofty, simple story." The same firm 
will publish, in quite another line, " The Navigator's 
Pocket-Book," by Captain Howard Patterson. It is in- 
tended especially as a handy guide for yachtsmen, among 
whom Captain Patterson has classes in navigation. 
Messrs. Scribner's Sons are also bringing out a popular 
series of fiction for summer reading, of which the books 
by Bliss Perry and Noah Brooks, already announced, 
form the opening volumes.

the belief that the importance of the events which have 
occurred since the adoption of the Constitution is be- 
coming more and more recognized, much the greater 
part of the book is devoted to the era beginning with 
1789. The earlier period, however, is treated with suf- 
ficient fulness to show clearly the origins of the people 
and their institutions. Throughout special attention is 
given to the political, social, and economic development

We take the following note from " The Book-Buyer ": 
" A very interesting contribution to a knowledge of Sid- 
ney Lanier's life and work has come into the possession 
of ' The Atlantic Monthly,' and will appear in two sum- 
mer numbers. It consists of many letters written by 
Lanier to Mr. Gibson Peacock, editor of the Philadel- 
phia ' Evening Bulletin.' Through the most active years 
of the poet's life, Mr. Peacock and he were intimate 
friends. From Mrs. Peacock, the letters, full of detail 
and rich in all that reveals the writer's nature, came to 
Mr. W. R. Thayer, editor of ' The Harvard Graduates' 
Magazine,' who has prepared them, with an introduc- 
tion, for print. It seems indeed as if the whirligig of 
time were well at work when a magazine so identified 
with the North finds the opportunity of rendering gladly 
a great service to the memory of a poet so distinctly 
associated with the South."

For England, mother of kings of battle and song 
Be it rapine, racial hate's mysterious wrong, 

Blizzard of Chance, or fiery dart of Doom 

Let breath of Avon, rich of meadow-bloom, 
Bind her to that great daughter severed long 
To near and far-off children young and strong 

With fetters woven of Avon's flower-perfume. 

Welcome, ye English-speaking pilgrims, ye 
Whose hands around the world are joined by him, 

Who make his speech the language of the sea, 
Till winds of Ocean waft from rim to rim 

The breath of Avon : let this great day be 
A Feast of Race no power shall ever dim. 
n. 

From where the steeds of Earth's twin oceans toss 
Their manes around Columbia's chariot-way 
From where Australia's long blue billows play 

From where the morn, quenching the Southern Cross, 

Startling the frigate-bird and albatross 
Asleep in air, breaks over Table Bay 
Come hither, Pilgrims, where these rushes sway 

'Tween grassy banks of Avon soft as moss ! 

And, if ye found the breath of Ocean sweet, 
Sweeter is Avon's earthy, flowery smell, 
Distilled from roots that feel the coming spell 

Of May, when all the flowers that loved him meet 

In meadows that, remembering Shakespeare's feet, 
Hold still a dream of music where they fell.

A LITERARY PARABLE. 

The following " literary parable " is contributed to 
" The Writer " by Miss Harriet Cushman Wilkie : 

" One spring morning a farmer knocks at the kitchen 
door of a city house, with a basket of fresh-laid eggs 
for sale. The mistress expresses delight at obtaining 
them, declaring, however, that it is her invariable cus- 
tom to pay for articles after they have appeared on her 
table, and then only such a price as she thinks fit. Ex- 
pecting an early settlement under those conditions, and 
being in need of cash for the interest on the mortgage 
on his farm, the man accepts the lady's terms and de- 
parts. Week after week and month after month go by, 
but no payment is made for the eggs. When he calls 
at the house to inquire, the maid informs him that her 
mistress bids her say that the great variety of seasonable 
articles of food has prevented the use of the eggs, but 
that she hopes very soon to find a place for them on 
her menu. In the autumn the farmer is surprised to 



have the maid hand him the basket, saying that, as the 
eggs have lost their freshness and are uneatable, her 
mistress returns them, with thanks for the opportunity 
for purchasing, and hopes that the farmer will call when- 
ever he is in town and allow an examination of his stock." 



A REVIVAL OF STENDHAL IN FRANCE. 

" S. D." writes as follows from Paris to the " Even- 
ing Post " of New York: 

" Another hitherto unpublished work of Stendhal is 
coming out soon. The cult of this harsh but powerful 
author of sixty years ago is rather on the increase than 
otherwise, after a period of waning. It is likely to be 
fed for some time to come from the six volumes of 
MSS., preserved mainly in the library of Grenoble. The 
present is the sixth volume in book form already pub- 
lished from this source. ' Lucien Leuwen,' the name 
of the new romance, was never finished by the author, 
though begun before any of his great works. In 1834, 
however, he gave careful instructions about publishing 
it in due time. It scarcely disguises even the names of 
the personages whom he had in mind. He says him- 
self: 'I have followed a usage of painters which I find 
amusing, and have worked from models.' The result 
is keen enough, at this late date, to verify the forebod- 
ings of the author, who also left in his directions: ' Care 
must be taken to remove every allusion that would be 
too clear and make of the book a satire. Vinegar is 
good, but mixed with cream it makes a detestable dish.' 
Even so, it has been found necessary to suppress cer- 
tain things which might come home to the children of 
those whom Stendhal desired to castigate for the part 
taken in the politics of the First Empire and the 
Restoration. It makes up what the scientific jargon, 
so much in vogue in France at present, calls a ' physi- 
ology ' of the first part of the century ; and like all of 
this author's work, it consists mainly of leaves from the 
autobiography of Henri Beyle (of whom Stendhal was 
only a pseudonym). In over 500 pages it pursues the 
answer to the initial question put before its hero by his 
father, ' Will you be knave enough to be employed in 
politics ? ' " 

CURIOSITIES OF ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION. 

A recent book of reminiscences by Mr. Frankfort 
Moore, a London journalist, furnishes the following 
amusing instances of " English as she is pronounced " by 
the occasional Irishman: 

" It may be remembered that ten or eleven years ago 
the late Mr. Dion Boucicault was obliging enough to 
offer to give a lecture to English actors on the correct 
pronunciation of their mother-tongue. The offer was, 
I suppose, thought too valuable to be neglected, and it 
was arranged that the lecture should be delivered from 
the stage of the Lyceum Theatre. A more interesting 
and amusing function I have never attended. It was 
clear that the lecturer had formed some very definite 
ideas as to the way the English language should be 
spoken; and his attempts to convey these ideas to his 
audience were most praiseworthy. His illustrations of 
the curiosities of some methods of pronouncing words 
were certainly extremely curious. For instance, he com- 
plained bitterly of the way the majority of English ac- 
tors pronounced the word ' war.' ' Ye pronounce the 
ward as if it wuz spelt w-a-u-g-h,' said the lecturer 
gravely. ' Ye don't pronounce it at all as ye shud. 
The ward rhymes with "par," "are," and "kyar," and 
yet ye will pronounce it as if it rhymed with " saw " and 
" paw." Don't ye see see the diffurnce ? ' ' We do, 



1894.]

we do ! ' cried the audience; and, thus encouraged by 
the ready acquiescence in his pet theories, the lecturer 
went on to deal with the gross absurdity of pronounc- 
ing the word ' grass,' not to rhyme with ' lass,' which of 
course was the correct way, but almost not quite 
as if it rhymed with ' laws.' ' The ward is " grass," not 
" graws," ' said our lecturer. ' It grates on a sinsitive 
ear like mine to hear it misprenounced. Then ye will 
never be injuced to give the ward " Chrischin " its thrue 
value as a ward of three syllables ; ye'll insist on calling 
it " Christyen," in place of " Chrischin." D'ye persave 
the diffurnce ? ' ' We do, we do ! ' cried the audience. 
' Ay, and ye talk about " soots " of gyarments, when ev- 
erybody knows that ye shud say "shoots"; ye must 
give the full valye to the letter " u " there's no double 
o in a shoot of clothes. Moreover, ye talk of the mim- 
bers of the polis force as " cunstables," but there's no 
"u" in the first syllable it's an "o," and it shud be 
prenounced to rhyme with " gone," not with " gun." 
Then I've heard an actor who shud know better say, in 
the part of Hamlet, "wurds, wurds, wurds"; instead 
of giving that fine letter " o " its full value. How much 
finer it sounds to pronounce it as I do, " wards, wards, 
wards " ! But when I say that I've heard the ward 
" pull " prenounced not to rhyme with " dull," as ye'll 
all admit it shud be, but actually as if it was within an 
ace of being spelt " p double o 1," I think ye'll agree with 
me that it's about time that actors learnt something of 
the rudiments of the art of ellycution.' "

CORRECTING A MISTAKE. 



DO YOU know the difference between a mistake and a blunder ? When you lay down a good umbrella and 
take up a poor one, you make a mistake; but when you lay down a poor umbrella and take up a good one, 
you make a blunder. 

So in bicycles. When you buy a poorer bicycle than you ought to ride, you make a mistake ; when you buy 
anything but the best you make a blunder. When you buy any bicycle without first seeing the '94 Warwick, you 
make a blundering mistake. 

The best time to correct a blundering mistake is before you make it ! Therefore get our catalogue. Get it at 
once ! Don't leave the chair in which you are now sitting until you have written a postal asking for it. 

When it arrives, live on it for fifteen minutes. Examine the Table of Contents for the New Features of 
1894 the new sectional wood rims, New Patent Adjustable Handle-Bars, New Rear Brake, New Frame with 
bearings on the same level, New Chain Adjustment, etc., etc. 

Don't overlook the old Warwick virtue of Construction which has given these wheels the reputation of being 
" built on honor." This is a very important feature. So, too, are the Warwick dust-proof bearings, for they are 
the only ones in the world. 

When the fifteen minutes are up, if you do not decide to purchase a Warwick, no harm has been done. But 
why speak of the impossible ? If you study a Warwick Catalogue carefully fifteen minutes, you will buy no other 
make.

THE HISTORY OF TRADE UNIONISM. 

By SIDNEY and BEATRICE WEBB. 
With Map, Appendix of Tables, Bibliography, etc., and Index.

Kingdom from 1700 down to the present day. Founded almost entirely 
upon material hitherto unpublished, it is not a mere chronicle of Trade 
Union organization or record of strikes, but gives, in effect, the political 
history of the English working-class during the last 150 years.

Socialism and Social Reform. 

BY 

PROF. RICHARD T. ELY, LL.D., 

Author of " The Labor Movement," " Problems of 

To-day," "Taxation in American States and 

Cities," " Social Aspects of Christianity," etc. 

I2mo, $1.50. 



The initial chapters of this volume contain an histori- 
cal and descriptive account of the progress of Socialism, 
and an exposition of the differences existing between the 
various schools. This is followed by an admirably fair 
exposition of the strength of Socialism, which is balanced 
by a critique of its weaknesses and a statement of the 
valid objections to the system. The last part of the vol- 
ume is devoted to the discussion of " Practicable Social 
Reform," showing how far society can reasonably go in 
the direction of Socialism. Numerous appendices and 
an exhaustive Bibliography add to the value of the work. 
The author's views are presented in a clear, candid, and 
fearless manner, and furnish one of the best discussions 
of this subject.

Memoirs Illustrating the History 

of Napoleon I. from 1802 

to 1815. 

By Baron CIAUDE-FRANCOIS DE MENEVAL, Private Secre- 
tary to Napoleon. Edited by his grandson, Baron NAPO- 
LEON JOSEPH DE MENEVAL. With Portraits and Autograph 
Letters. In three volumes, 8vo, cloth. 
These volumes, published simultaneously in France, En- 
gland, and America, furnish a picture of Napoleon's daily 
life which is believed to be unexcelled in point of closeness of 
observation and graphic detail by any other narrative. That 
Meneval was not the man to neglect his opportunities is shown 
abundantly by the glimpses of character revealed in his diaries 
and notes. Yet, for personal and other reasons, his invalu- 
able recollections were not given to the world. They have 
been treasured by his family until the present time of pro- 
found interest in Napoleonic history. Of Napoleon's relations 
with Josephine and Marie Louise of all the features of his 
domestic and social existence Meneval had abundant knowl- 
edge, for he shared Napoleon's private life ; and, since he was 
sitting at the fountain-head of information, he was able to shed 
a new light on many features of the Napoleonic campaigns. 
His narrative is most interesting ; its historical importance 
need not be emphasized. 

Creatures of Other Days. 

By Rev. H. N. HUTCHINSON, B.A., F.G.S., author of " The 
Autobiography of the Earth," "Extinct Monsters," etc. 
With numerous Illustrations. 8vo, cloth, $3.00. 
"... The disjointed and often fragmentary bones by 
which these animals are usually represented in museums con- 
vey no ideas whatever to the majority of those who see them. 
It is quite otherwise with such representations as the figures 
of this work ; and if in some cases the idea conveyed may not 
be strictly correct, it offers a fair approximation, and at all 
events gives a vivid conception of some remarkable creature 
which in its main outlines can not be far from the actual real- 
ity." From the Preface, by Sir W. H. Flower, F.R.S. 

Hume. 

With Helps to the Study of Berkeley. By THOMAS H. HUX- 
LEY. The sixth volume of the author's Collected Essays.

CONTENTS. Early Life of Hume : Literary and Political 
Writings. Later Years : The History of England. The Ob- 
ject and Scope of Philosophy. The Contents of the Mind.

A System of Lucid Shorthand. 

Devised by WILLIAM GOORGE SPENCER. With a Prefatory 
Note by HERBERT SPENCER. 12mo, cloth, 50 cts. 
This system, devised by Mr. Herbert Spencer's father, has 
been in manuscript since 1843. It is now published, as ex- 
plained by the writer of the Prefatory Note, not because it 
possesses advantages over existing phonographies for report- 
ing and kindred purposes, but "from the conviction, long 
since formed and still unshaken, that it ought to replace or- 
dinary writing." It is claimed that, as it possesses the brev- 
ity of shorthands in general, and greater legibility, the use of 
it by men of business, journalists, authors, and people at large, 
would achieve a great economy of life. 



Aerial Navigation. 

By J. G. W. FIJNJE VAN SALVERDA, late Administrator of 
Public Works of the Netherlands. Translated from the 
Dutch, by GEORGE E. WARING, Jr. With Notes concern- 
ing some Recent Developments in the Art. Illustrated. 
12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

The author states that the important question of aerial nav- 
igation has taken on a more and more scientific character, 
and has enlisted the increasing interest of serious minds ; and 
that among competent experts the opinion is held that a bril- 
liant future is before it. To recent meteorological observa- 
tions, and numerous investigations as to the movements of 
birds, are mainly attributed the remarkable advances toward 
the solution of the problem 1 , detailed accounts of which are 
comprised in this interesting volume. 

A Daughter of To=day. 

By Mrs. EVERARD COTES (Sara Jeannette Duncan), author of 
" A Social Departure," "An American Girl in London," 
etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Few literary debutantes have met with the success obtained 
by Sara Jeannette Duncan's first book, " A Social Departure. " 
Her succeeding books showed the same powers of quick ob- 
servation and graphic description, the same ability to identify 
and portray types. Meantime, the author has greatly enlarged 
her range of experience and knowledge of the world. A true 
cosmopolite, London, Paris, and Calcutta have become famil- 
iar to her, as well as New York and Montreal. The title of 
her new book indicates an immediately attractive theme, and 
the author's vigorous treatment of it has given us a book dis- 
tinguished not only by acute study of character, command of 
local color, and dramatic force, but also by contemporaneous 
interest. This novel is Mrs. Cotes's most advanced and most 
important literary work. 

The Rich Miss Riddell. 

By DOROTHEA GERARD, author of "A Queen of Curds and 
Cream," "Etelka's Vow," etc. No. 142, Town and Coun- 
try Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00. 
" Miss Gerard is a novelist who has made a place for herself in which 
she stands alone. An excellent delineator of character, she has a charm- 
ingly fresh style, and knowledge of cosmopolitan life in all its phases 
which is hardly equalled by any other English writer." London Morn- 
ing Post. 

Mary Fenwick's Daughter. 

By BEATRICE WHITBY, author of " The Awakening of Mary 
Fenwick," " Part of the Property," etc. No. 143, Town 
and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00.

ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITIES. 

Mr. Churton Collins, writing six or seven 
years ago upon the subject of the instruction 
in English at the English higher schools and 
universities, complained that " it attains none 
of the ends which a subject in itself so full of 
attraction and interest might be expected to at- 
tain. It fails to fertilize ; it fails to inform ; 
it fails even to awaken curiosity." This triple 
failure he ascribes to the fact that literature 



" has been regarded not as the expression of 
art and genius, but as mere material for the 
study of words, as mere pabulum for philol- 
ogy." Again, the whole machinery of higher 
education in England is subordinated to the in- 
terests of examiners, and its final product is 
the successful examinee, the man who is found 
equal to the Civil Service tests, the classman 
of the Tripos. Even so sound a thinker as Pro- 
fessor Goldwin Smith has recently doubted the 
success of the new Oxford school of English 
literature, on the ground that the subject does 
not easily lend itself to the traditional sort of 
examination. Emerson, many years ago, out- 
lined the New History in the phrase : " Broader 
and deeper we must write our annals." Sim- 
ilarly, we may say to such cavillers as Profes- 
sor Smith : " Broader and deeper must we make 
our examination papers." The subject of En- 
glish literature has far too high an educational 
value to be neglected merely because it requires 
some adaptation or reconstruction of a few time- 
honored methods and adjuncts of teaching. 

The articles upon the higher teaching of En- 
glish that have been contributed to THE DIAL 
during the past months go far to show that the 
objection raised by Professor Smith and others 
is nothing more than a bugbear. If American 
experience (as recorded in these articles) counts 
for anything, we must admit that it establishes 
beyond question the claims of English as a 
proper subject of university instruction. Does 
it fail to fertilize, to inform, to awaken curios- 
ity ? Let us see what a few of our educators 
think about it. Says Professor Cook : " The 
writer might formulate the especial object 
which he proposes to himself as the develop- 
ment in the student, whether graduate or un- 
dergraduate, of insight and power, and indeed 
he conceives this to be the end of all education 
whatever. The imparting of information seems 
to him quite a secondary object; and a love 
for literature is most likely, as he thinks, to be 
promoted by the acquisition of insight and 
power." Says Professor Corson : " It is con- 
sidered of prime importance that students 
should first attain to a sympathetic appreciation 
of what is essential and intrinsic, before the 
adventitious features of literature features 
due to time and place be considered." Pro-

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



fessor Dodge, speaking of the study of Shake- 
speare, says that grammatical criticism is 
treated sparingly, and textual criticism even 
more so. He then adds : " The results of this 
method of Shakespeare study have been very 
encouraging, many of the pupils seeming to de- 
velope from it a real love for the subject." 
Professor March writes that the courses under 
his direction are constant to the central idea of 
this passage quoted from Arnold of Rugby : 
" What a treat it would be to teach Shake- 
speare to a good class of young Greeks in re- 
generate Athens ; to dwell upon him line by 
line and word by word, and so get all his pic- 
tures and thoughts leisurely into one's mind, 
till I verily think one would, after a time, al- 
most give out light in the dark, after having 
been steeped, as it were, in such an atmosphere 
of brilliance." 

These remarks, which might be multiplied 
indefinitely, seem to us fairly typical of the 
spirit in which the subject of English litera- 
ture is studied in our colleges and universities. 
Avoiding the dangerous extremes of pedantry 
on the one hand and dilettantism on the other, 
our teachers of literature seem to be animated 
by the desire to impart the spirit of literary ap- 
preciation no less than the methods of exact 
scholarship in literary investigation. The large 
proportion of students taking English courses 
is almost everywhere noticeable, and there is 
little evidence that these courses are elected 
because they are " soft." There is a recent and 
growing tendency to base the doctor's degree 
upon English as a principal subject, and to en- 
courage publication of the theses offered. In- 
spection of a number of such theses that have 
come to hand during the past two years shows 
them to compare more than favorably with the 
similar work done in English at the German uni- 
versities. In this American work, aesthetic and 
philosophical criticism has its full share, and 
its recognition is not to the detriment of rig- 
orous training or sound scholarship. 

We have dwelt more fully upon the esthetic 
than upon the linguistic side of English train- 
ing, but from no intention of ignoring the im- 
portance of the latter aspect. The linguistic 
part of the field is in no danger of careless cul- 
tivation, and has little need of fertilizers. The 
methods of linguistic study have been so thor- 
oughly formulated and systematized by workers 
in the classical languages that they may be 
transferred with slight modification to the sub- 
ject of the English or any other modern tongue. 
But there is still something resembling anarchy 



in our treatment of English from the side of 
aesthetic criticism as well as from that of history 
or of philosophy. Hence it is necessary to direct 
the attention mainly to these aspects. It seems 
to be of the first importance that the two grand 
divisions of the subject should be sharply dif- 
ferentiated. By this we mean that a univer- 
sity should have two departments of English 
rather than one. It is theoretically conceivable 
that scholars might be found of such broad and 
balanced culture as to be competent to direct 
the work in both fields. But such men are too 
rare to be counted upon. The English scholars 
in our universities are, almost without excep- 
tion, either literary critics or masters of lin- 
guistic science ; they are rarely if ever both at 
once. Now this means that a department of 
English having a single head will almost inev- 
itably become developed upon one side at the 
expense of the other. Such of our institutions 
as Columbia College, Cornell University, and 
Stanford University have clearly recognized this 
difficulty, and have kept English linguistics dis- 
tinct from English literature. 

Assuming this differentiation, what should 
be the qualifications of a professor of English 
literature proper ? His function, to quote from 
Mr. Collins once more, " is the interpreta- 
tion of power and beauty as they reveal them- 
selves in language, not simply by resolving 
them into their constituent elements, but by 
considering them in their relation to princi- 
ples." To perform this function it is evident 
that he must have a thorough training in the 
history of criticism, from Aristotle to Mr. Pa- 
ter; that he must have a wide acquaintance 
with literature, ancient and modern, native and 
foreign ; that he must have a delicately-attuned 
ear and a cultivated aesthetic sense; that, finally, 
he must have in an unusual degree the power 
of giving literary expression to his thought, and 
something like a passion for bringing other 
minds into sympathetic communion with his 
own. He should be, in a word, as nearly as 
possible such a man as Arnold, or Lowell, or 
Sainte-Beuve, among the dead, or as M. Brune- 
tiere, or Mr. Watts, or Mr. Stedman, among 
the living. Men of this type, or approaching 
this type, some of our universities already have ; 
the others may obtain them if they will but en- 
large their horizon sufficiently to recognize the 
fact that for the work of giving vital instruc- 
tion in English literature other than merely 
academic qualifications are needed ; that such 
qualifications are, indeed, of but secondary im- 
portance.

DEATHS OF A MONTH. 



When Henry Morley announced, seven years ago, 
that he was about to carry out his long-cherished 
plan of preparing a systematic history of English 
writers, it was hoped, as someone suggested at the 
time, that our literature had at last found its Tira- 
boschi. The suggestion was over-sanguine, for now, 
the great work but half-completed, the author has 
found rest from his labors. Professor Morley was 
born September 15, 1822, and died on the 14th of 
last month, in the seventy-second year of his age. 
He was educated in Germany, and at King's Col- 
lege, London. He practiced medicine in his early 
years, but abandoned the profession in 1851, when 
he went into London journalism. He assisted Dick- 
ens in editing " Household Words " and became 
himself editor of "The Examiner." From 1857 to 
1865 he lectured on English literature at King's 
College. In the latter year he became professor of 
the English language and literature at University 
College, holding the chair until 1889, when he was 
made emeritus professor and retired to Carisbrooke, 
Isle of Wight, where he has lived during the five 
years just past. In 1879 the University of Edinburgh 
conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D. 
His writings are very numerous. Those of a mis- 
cellaneous character include " How to Make Home 
Unhealthy" (1850), "Life of Palissy the Potter" 
(1852), "Jerome Cardan" (1854), "Cornelius 
Agrippa" (1856), " Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair " 
(1857), " Fables and Fairy Tales " (1860), "Jour- 
nal of a London Play-Goer " (1866), Life of Cle- 
ment Marot, and Other Studies " (1870). He 
edited " The Spectator," Florio's Montaigne, Bos- 
well's Johnson, " The Universal Library," "Cassell's 
National Library," and " The Carisbrooke Library." 
His special work as a historian of English literature 
began with " English Writers before Chaucer " 
(1864), and was followed by " From Chaucer to 
Dunbar" (1867). These stout octavos were fol- 
lowed by "Tables of English Literature" (1870), 
a "First Sketch of English Literature" (1873), 
and " English Literature in the Reign of Victoria " 
(1881), the latter work being prepared for Baron 
Tauchnitz, and published as the 2000th volume of 
his well-known series. In 1887, his magnum opus 
on " English Writers " was seriously resumed, and 
ten of the twenty volumes projected have been given 
to the public. The tenth volume takes us through 
the reign of Elizabeth. The eleventh volume (which 
we hope was completed before the death of the au- 
thor) was to deal with Shakespeare and his con- 
temporaries of the reign of King James. Better 
than any comment, the list of books above enum- 
erated serves to indicate Henry Morley's tireless 
industry, and to reveal the extent of the gratitude 
felt for him by every student of our literature. 
It is easy to find minute defects in the work, and 
to show that its critical quality is not of the highest, 
but the fact remains that it conceives, and half car- 



ries out, the most extensive and scholarly treat- 
ment of English literary history that has yet been 
attempted. 

English science met with one of the severest 
of losses in the death, on the 23d of last month, of 
John George Romanes. He was just forty-six 
years of age, having been born at Kingston, Can- 
ada, May 20, 1848. He was educated at Caius 
College, Cambridge, taking natural science honors 
in 1870. He was intimately related with Darwin 
during the closing ten years of the latter's life, and 
has been one of the most energetic exponents of the 
Darwinian theories. Among his works are " Sci- 
ence Lectures for the People " (1878 ), " Animal In- 
telligence " (1882), "Charles Darwin, His Charac- 
acterand Life" (1882), "The Scientific Evidences 
of Organic Evolution " (1882), " Mental Evolution 
in Animals" (1883), "The Star-Fish, Jelly-Fish, 
and Sea-Urchins" (1885), and "Mental Evolution 
in Man" (1889). He has been a frequent contrib- 
utor to periodicals, and has been one of the stoutest 
opponents of Professor Weissmann's new and rev- 
olutionary theories of animal development. 

Edmund Yates, whose death was announced on 
the 21st of May, was a conspicuous figure in Lon- 
don journalism, but can hardly be said to have done 
any serious work in literature. He was born in 1831 . 
He wrote many novels and plays, among the former 
being "Broken to Harness," "Kissing the Rod," 
"Black Sheep," "Land at Last," "The Forlorn 
Hope," " A Righted Wrong," " Castaway," " No- 
body's Fortune," " The Yellow Flag," and " The 
Impending Sword." He visited America in 1872, 
and again in 1885. In 1884 he published " Fifty 
Years of London Life," a readable volume of rem- 
iniscences. He is perhaps best remembered for his 
expulsion from the Garrick Club at the instigation 
of Thackeray, about whom he had written an arti- 
cle which was, to say the least, in bad taste ; and 
by his imprisonment in 1884 for another highly in- 
discreet editorial utterance. 

The cable that brought news of the death of Ro- 
manes conveyed to us, on the same day, the news 
of Madame Renan's death. The widow of the great 
philologist, who thus survived her husband less than 
two years, was, it will be remembered, a daughter 
of the painter, Ary Scheffer. Since Renan's death, 
his widow has been engaged in preparing for pub- 
lication his posthumous works. 

Still earlier in the month there came news of the 
death at Lindheim, in the Duchy of Hesse, of the 
death of Leopold Sacher-Masoch, on the sixth of 
May, in his fifty-ninth year. He was born at Lem- 
bersr, in Galicia, and has done more than all other 

' 

writers together to make that province of the Aus- 
trian Empire familiar to readers all over the world. 
He studied in Gratz and Prague, and became a pro- 
fessor of history in the university of the former city. 
His first work was " Der Auf stand in Gent unter 
Karl V." (1858). His first novel was " Eine Gali- 
zische Geschichte " (1866). This was followed by

many others, among which we mention " Das Ver- 
machtnis Kains," a " Novellencyclus " of which the 
successive parts were published at intervals, " Die 
GeschiedeneFrau" (1870), "Die Republik der Wei- 
berfeinde " (1872), " Maria Theresia und die Frei-

"Der Neue Hjob " (1874), "Die Ideale unserer

" Le Cabinet Noir de Lemberg " and " L' Ilau " 
( 1880 ), both in French " Die Messalinen 
Wiens," and " Ein Weiblicher Sultan." His novels 
found great favor with the French public, attracted 
by their sensuous quality and their not always ar- 
tistic realism, and a great number of them have 
been translated for the " Revue des Deux Mondes." 
He was an enemy of the German Empire and a 
champion of the Jew. His serious works include 
" Ungarns Untergang und Maria," " Kaunitz," " .ZEs- 
thetik des Hasslichen," and " Ueber den Werth der 
Kritik." He was made a member of the Legion 
of Honor by the French Government. 



ENGLISH AT THE STATE UNIVER- 
SITY OF IOWA * 

The State University of Iowa has one Professor 
of English and one Instructor, and offers during the 
present year eight courses. All but one of these 
are two-hour courses, making a total of seventeen 
hours, the actual teaching time being somewhat more, 
owing to division in classes. Of these eight courses, 
four are required. In the Freshman year a choice 
is given between courses I. and II. ; in the Sopho- 
more year, between III. and IV. There are about 
two hundred and fifty students registered in the va- 
rious courses, counting perhaps twenty names twice. 
Besides these courses, "the University offers two 
courses in Elocution and a good deal of private work 
under a special instructor, and for next year it offers 
a course in Debating under the joint supervision of 
the Professors of Political Science, Philosophy, and 
English. But these latter matters hardly come within 
the scope of the present series of articles. 

In the required work of the English Department, 
there are two lines offered to the student. Courses 
I. and III. are sjtrictly rhetorical in character, being 
the only courses in Rhetoric that we give. In these

courses our idea is not exactly to teach formal rhet- 
oric as the art is usually presented in the older text- 
books, but rather to present the subject in a con- 
structive way, according to the general line of recent 
thought on the subject. We try to habituate the 
student to writing (as well as possible, of course, but 
without insistence on critical work), to give him 
practice in thinking over his material and putting it 
into good form, to give him exercise in the different 
modes of presentation. Such is the tendency of 
most of the handbooks on rhetoric and of most of 
the discussions of the matter published in the last 
few years. 

The alternative courses offered the Freshmen and 
Sophomores are literary with a rhetorical flavor. 
In the first year a number of prose authors are read, 
with comment on their style. In the second, the 
class uses Professor Minto's admirable Manual. It 
seems that there are always a number of students 
who make very little of rhetoric as usually taught ; 
we want, in these courses, to see whether they can 
do as well by reading good authors as their class- 
mates do by more direct practice in means and meth- 
ods. In all four courses there is a good deal of 
essay-writing. But as far as we can see at present, 
the direct work will give the better results. 

In the elective courses, we draw the line sharply 
between linguistic work and literary. If it were 
practical, I should like to divide further, giving 
courses devoted particularly to literary history and 
to the interpretation of literature. As it is, how- 
ever, these last subjects are treated in the same 
courses. In linguistics we give this year a course 
in Old English and another on Historical English 
Grammar. But these courses (and a course in 
Middle English as well that has been given) are 
not favorites with the student body, and are only 
given on alternate years. 

For courses in literature, besides the Freshman 
course (II.) described above, and the course in En- 
glish Prose (IV.), there is given this year a course 
of lectures on English Poetry. The subject of this 
course is changed each year, so that the student who 
wishes may in three years get a fairly complete 
view of English poetry from Chaucer down, includ- 
ing a good deal of work on Shakespeare. 

A seminary, in the stricter American sense of a 
research course, we do not have. We do, how- 
ever, give a course for seniors and graduates, which 
bears a fairly close resemblance in character to the 
seminar of a smaller German university. The work 
of this course is generally concerned with some as- 
pects of criticism, and we sometimes follow one 
method, sometimes another. I have gone over a 
text-book, or lectured, or given out topics for orig- 
inal work. The main idea is that by means of the 
closer personal relation possible through the inform- 
alities of the seminary, the spirit of self-reliance and 
independence shall be developed in the members. 

It will easily be seen from this sketch of our 
work that the basis of our method is the cutting

We have two main ideas : first, to give plenty of op-

tory. But these are matters which for the present

HOW SHALL ENGLISH LITERATURE BE 

TAUGHT? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The articles on the teaching of English at American 
universities, in current numbers of THE DIAL, are sig- 
nificant of the growing popular interest in the subject. 
Nevertheless it is noticeable with what commendable 
caution the several authors avoid the more general and 
popular aspects of the question. But the question is 
one that is properly within the keeping of the educated 
opinion of non-professionals, and that concerns the read- 
ing and literary public more than any other technical 
question. The movement for a reformed teaching of 
English in the universities represents the outcome of 
the general reaction against a one-sided and prevail- 
ingly philological or linguistic presentation of the sub- 
ject, a movement which has been going on here and 
abroad for the last twenty years. The general tone of 
the articles in THE DIAL indicates the willingness in- 
deed, the eagerness of the teachers of English in the 
universities to meet the demands for a reformed method. 
In some respects it even may be thought that the reac- 
tion is becoming extreme. 

The interesting question, of course, is by what 
method may English literature, as distinguished from 
English philology, be properly taught to advanced 
classes. Everybody is agreed that it should be taught 
as literature, that a purely literary method should be 
employed. But what is the true literary method ? The 
teaching of literature in English, in the first place, in- 
volves several technical difficulties. There is no exer- 
cise of translation in itself a delicate and searching 
literary process when properly pursued, as there is in 
teaching literature in other languages to English-speak- 
ing students. In place of this it has been proposed to 
substitute "interpretation." But literary "interpreta- 
tion," even if it could be accurately defined, is a very 
inadequate and colorless substitute. Others among 
them, Professor Corson, perhaps would make finished 
recitation and reading aloud take the place of the exer- 
cise of translation. Both methods under strict lim- 
itations have their uses; but either one, pursued alone, 
is grotesquely inadequate for employment with ad- 
vanced classes. Then there are the various " scientific " 



methods that these new demands are calling forth 
the " analytical " method, the " inductive " method, the 
" psychological " method, and how many beside ? The 
fatal objection in every case is that each method, taken 
by itself, is inadequate and one-sided, although almost 
all of them have merits. To force any one of these 
methods upon our universities would be but to repeat 
the disastrous experiment with the inadequate and one- 
sided philological method. The real difficulty lies in 
the fact that while literary form is a definite subject, 
capable of definite presentation, the content of litera- 
ture which to the popular mind is its vital side im- 
pinges more or less upon most of the university depart- 
ments concerned with the humanities: history, philos- 
ophy, sociology, art, and the rest. The teacher of En- 
glish who concerns himself with the subject-matter of 
his texts soon wanders into forbidden fields and lo ! 
the dilletante. Under the old education, when the 
chief groundwork of the other humanities was absorbed 
through literary texts, it was another matter. The ques- 
tion is, What is the field for the teacher of English lit- 
erature ? Does it properly extend outside of literary 
history, literary aesthetics, the theory and analysis of 
style, versification and rhetoric, and the necessary phil- 
ological apparatus ? 

Above all, let us save the teaching of literature from 
the men of one method, the successors in disguise of 
the philologists, and from poachers wandering from 
other fields who seek to make literature their prey, but 
whose real interest is in ethics, or psychology, or so- 
ciology, or linguistics, or even in rhetorical analysis and 
the general pseudo-sciences of literature so-called.

REVIVAL OF A CLASSIC PUZZLE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While the echoes of the recent discussion of the Latin 
inscription on the World's Fair Obelisk are still heard, 
it may be of interest to reproduce the famous inscrip- 
tion graven on the vestibule wall of the palace of the 
Counts of Sanbonifazio, at Padua. This famous epigraph, 
though written with the utmost purity, has yet to have 
its meaning solved.

A whole library has been written concerning this inscrip- 
tion, and it has been a puzzle to Latin scholars for gen- 
erations. A recent issue of an Italian journal contained 
an extensive article on it, but no satisfactory conclusion 
as to its meaning, whether taken literally or metaphor- 
ically, has been reached. CHARLES EDWARDS.

INTERPRETER OF SCIENCE TOR 
THE PEOPLE.* 



In sketching for us the .life of Edward L. 
Youmans, Mr. John Fiske is writing of one to 
whom he refers as his "best and dearest friend." 
He calls him " the interpreter of science for the 
people." No name could be more happily chosen. 
The story of such a friend and of such a worker 
should be both interesting and valuable ; and 
such we find it. 

We may pass by the description of Mr. You- 
mans's childhood and young manhood. It is 
very interesting, and is well given ; it is even 
pathetic. There were years when strict econ- 
omy was necessary, the boyhood of diligent 
reading and study, the early manhood's hope 
of a college education blasted by blindness last- 
ing thirteen weary years. There was the no- 
ble effort to make a living by literary work, 
against obstacles which would have discouraged 
most men. But courage and hard work con- 
quered ; success came, and with its dawn light 
too came to those eyes so long darkened, and a 
magnificent career opened. 

Youmans was a writer ; his text-book of 
chemistry made a real sensation, and his other 
works are of value. He was a born teacher ; 
apt at illustration, clear in explanation : his 
diagrams illustrating the binary theory of chem- 
istry were most useful. He was a brilliant lec- 
turer ; his public discussions of scientific themes 
aroused profound interest. Writer, teacher, lec- 
turer, in either field he might have made a ca- 
reer, in all he won true recognition. But it was 
not in these that his greatest usefulness lay. 
His chief claim to remembrance lies in a three- 
fold work of a different sort : he introduced the 
works of the greatest European writers to an 
ignorant American public, he founded the " In- 
ternational Scientific Series " of books, he es- 
tablished the " Popular Science Monthly." 

Everyone knows that the Appletons are the 
publishers in this country of the great English 
scientists. The famous works of Darwin, Hux- 
ley, Lubbock, Tyndall, and Spencer are issued 
from their house. Everyone does not know that, 
notwithstanding the opportunity for piracy that 
our copyright laws allow, these authors have re- 
ceived a generous royalty from these publishers. 
Some may know these facts, but may not know 

* EDWARD LIVINGSTON YOUMANS : Interpreter of Science 
for the People. By John Fiske. New York : D. Appleton 
&Co. 



that it was Mr. Youmans who secured their 
publication and this generous recognition. It 
was he who watched carefully for every worthy 
book in " the new science," who called the atten- 
tion of the firm to it, arranged with the author, 
helped it through the press, saw that it was 
properly reviewed and given a chance before 
our one-time somewhat philistine public. This 
was in itself a vast educational work. 

Mr. Youmans early became interested in Mr. 
Herbert Spencer and his philosophy. He sought 
acquaintance with the great Englishman an 
acquaintance which became personal, ripened 
into friendship, showing itself in a thousand 
helpful ways. Through Youmans, Mr. Spen- 
cer's writings were published in America, and 
to him much of their success here was due. 
Mr. Fiske says : " As long as he [Youmans] 
lived, Mr. Spencer had upon this side of the 
Atlantic an alter ego ever on the alert, with 
vision like that of a hawk for the slightest 
chance to promote his interests and those of 
his system of thought." So true was this that 
on one occasion Mr. William Appleton said a 
very good thing in the matter : 

" Henry Carey called in to blow up the Appletons for 
publishing Spencer's free-trade doctrines. Spencer was 
an upstart; his system would soon die like Comte's 
and Mill's. Said W. H. Appleton, ' I can tell you one 
thing Spencer won't die so long as Youmans lives." 

In 1862 Youmans made his first visit to En- 
gland, and met Mr. Spencer personally. His 
first impressions are interestingly given in a 
letter to his sister, so well known on account 
of her own work in science. From it we select 
a few passages : 

" He is the most prompt, ready, adaptive and useful 
man in such an expedition I have ever known. He is 
wonderfully practical, and handles circumstances as they 
arise with all the energy and readiness of an experienced 
business man. . . . His health is bad. The difficulty is 
with his brain sleeplessness. He has not had a night's 
rest since he wrote the Psychology. He can 't sleep, and 
if he does he wakes ten or twenty times during the night. 
He is very excitable, and when excited cannot sleep at 
all, and gets alarmed at the state of his brain and flies 
from the scene of danger. . . . He did not say m uch to 
me about his experience, but alluded to it two or three 
times in a very simple and touching way in connection 
with the assistance he had received from America. That 
is all the profit he has ever yet had from his work, and 
he said it was as grateful and opportune as it was un- 
expected, for he had but little hope from that quarter; 
. . . and when I looked upon the man, with his health 
broken and nerves shattered, and remembered that his 
is the foremost intellect of our civilization, and that he 
is a man beyond all other men of his age to control the 
thought of the future ; when I thought of him hampered 
and harassed for want of means to publish his great 
thoughts as having to think for the world and then 
having to pay the expense of instruction, setting up other

men in intellectual business with a paragraph, I con- 
fess I thanked God that I have had a little opportunity 
to do him service." 

We cannot speak further of this so great 
work ; it led naturally to the next, the " Inter- 
national Scientific Series." This was a bold en- 
terprise. To have the world's leaders in science 
prepare handy books, fit for popular reading, 
upon some phase of their special theme ; to 
publish them simultaneously in America, En- 
gland, Germany, France, Italy, Russia; to have 
the authors properly remunerated for the pub- 
lication in each country, such were the novel 
features of the scheme. One cannot easily 
conceive the labor involved in planning, inaugu- 
rating, and carrying out such an enterprise. 
There were many discouragements and difficul- 
ties. England was first visited. Here You- 
mans needed every help that those whom he 
had assisted could give. Mr. Spencer was in- 
terested, and worked in various ways. Profes- 
sor Huxley's argument seems to have been a 
telling one with the English scientists: "Hux- 
ley backed me up grandly, and told them how 
much he had received from the Appletons for 
reprints." At last England was gained ; then 
France was visited, and then Germany. Of 
this last he wrote : " Germany is more ripe for 
the movement than even England ; its best men 
can be procured. It was Huxley's name which 
carried the thing there." And so, at last, the 
new venture was started. It has been pro- 
foundly successful, and the seventy volumes or 
more, in uniform red binding now so well 
known are to be seen in every library. The 
excellence of the work is shown by the names 
of the authors and the titles of their books : 
sample them Tyndall's "Forms of Wa- 
ter," Spencer's "Study of Sociology," Cooke's 
" New Chemistry," Maudsley's " Responsibil- 
ity," Whitney's " Life and Growth of Lan- 
guage," de Quatrefages' "Human Species," 
Tylor's "Anthropology," Semper's "Animal 
Life." And all of this for American readers, 
the outgrowth of one man's idea ! 

And from it grew the third special work of 
Youmans's useful life the " Popular Science 
Monthly." We cannot go into details to show 
how it was partly connected with the Spencer 
propaganda. The first number appeared in 
April, 1872. From that month till the pres- 
ent time it has done an excellent nay, a great 
work. It has had dark days ; it has been 
bitterly assailed and decried, but it has gone 
on and has made a profound impression. The 
American public has needed such a journal and 



has supported it. It has been fearless and out- 
spoken. Until his death in 1887, Youmans 
was the chief editor, although for long his 
brother, Dr. W. J. Youmans (the present ed- 
itor) shared the burden. As editor, he was 
ever ready to speak clearly and plainly upon 
the burning questions of the day. The monthly 
has been repeatedly branded as irreligious and 
atheistic. It has never been either. Edward 
Livingston Youmans was profoundly independ- 
ent, an original thinker, who never flinched 
from speaking out a careful thought ; but he 
was himself a man profoundly religious and 
earnest. We may perhaps fitly close this re- 
view of his work by two quotations from his 
address on " The Religious Work of Science ": 

" The theologians who claimed to be authorized ex- 
pounders of the divine policy insisted not only that 
breaks and interruptions of the natural order occurred, 
but they maintained that it is in these breaches of it 
that the Creator is most conspicuously and impressively 
seen. Holding that the normal phenomena are of small 
concern while their ruptures alone disclose divine inter- 
vention, they left it to the men of science to work out 
the natural order to its completeness, and to vindicate 
the Almighty, whose wisdom is witnessed not in the vio- 
lations, but in the perfections of his works " (p. 494^. 

" In a religious point of view, it [evolution] has but 
one significance. Offering a grander conception of the 
cosniical order and a deeper insight into its wonderful 
workings than had ever before been obtained, it is the 
sublimest tribute that the human mind has ever made 
to the glory of the Divine power to which it must be 
ascribed. With the acceptance of evolution the un- 
worthy philosophy which has sought to honor God by 
the derangements of his own work comes to an end and 
the argument passes into a new phase " (p. 499).

CHILE AND THE CHILEANS.* 
The western hemisphere contains two dis- 
tinct civilizations. In the north the Anglo- 
Saxon race has founded a splendid republic, 
composed of a people sturdy in principle, in- 
dependent in government, shrewd and ener- 
getic in business. In the south has grown up 
that heterogeneous, freedom-loving, brave and 
unreliable race that has built up and over- 
thrown governments for a hundred years, and 
is still struggling toward the light of a pure 
republicanism. But though living in the same 
hemisphere, we of the north have very vague 
notions concerning our southern neighbors. 

Latin America is popularly supposed to be 
the country where revolutions are the only di-

version, where the people are lazy, and where 
the unscrupulous are the successful. We read 
in our daily papers of an insurgent navy in Bra- 
zil, of a deposed president in Honduras, of one 
dictator and two presidents trying at one and 
the same time to manage Peruvian affairs ; and 
we smile with superior pity, and wonder what 
they will do next. We accept as a foregone 
conclusion that " next " will be another up- 
heaval of some sort, though few of us have 
any historic knowledge upon which to base our 
suppositions. We are in a state of Cimmer- 
ian darkness concerning the antecedents of our 
restless neighbors. It is to dispel this darkness 
of ignorance, and to arouse a wider and deeper 
interest in Latin American affairs, that a series 
of historical works is being issued by Messrs. 
C. H. Sergei & Co., the initial volume of 
which was a history of Peru by the brilliant 
writer and able historian, Mr. Clements R. 
Markham. This is now followed by a history of 
Chile by Mr. Anson Uriel Hancock. Other vol- 
umes are in course of preparation, and we hope 
soon to see a complete set of the Latin Amer- 
ican Republics. The aim is to give a histor- 
ical sketch of the several republics, from the 
time of the conquest, through the periods of 
colonial rule and of wars for independence, 
down through this last century of struggle for 
constitutional freedom. 

Chile is one of the most interesting and best 
known of the republics. Her belligerent atti- 
tude during our late little unpleasantness with 
her gave irresistible opportunities to the carica- 
turist and to the writer of scathing editorials, 
so that the peppery little southerner became a 
very familiar figure. The story of Chile's con- 
quest by the Spaniards is thrilling and roman- 
tic in the extreme. The stubborn persistency 
and cold cruelty of Almagro rivals that of Pi- 
zarro. The bold defiance and unyielding re- 
sistance of the Araucanians contrasts with the 
superstitious fear and dreary fatalism of the 
Incas and Aztecs. The bold exploits of the 
youthful Lautaro, and of the girl warrior Jane- 
queo, vie with any tale of Spartan valor or 
of French heroism. Mr. Hancock has treated 
this period in a conscientious manner, giving 
the details of the various campaigns with great 
fidelity. There may be a lack of color in his 
treatment, but the plain incidents themselves 
are perhaps sufficiently vivid for the average 
reader. But it was not the character of the 
conquest alone that modified and moulded the 
history of Chile. Another element exercised 
a more powerful influence on the political and 



social life : the colonial system, which bound 
and fettered colonist and Indian alike for nearly 
three hundred years. This period is briefly but 
adequately treated ; and then the author passes 
on to the war of independence, which is told in 
fuller detail. In South America the contagion 
of liberty spread from province to province, 
and the struggle for freedom was combined and 
simultaneous. The history of the revolution in 
Chile is linked with that of the Argentine Re- 
public, of Peru, and of Colombia. The names 
of San Martin, of Bolivar, and of Belgrano are 
honored in all alike. It is impossible, there- 
fore, to give a perfectly satisfactory account of 
Chile's struggle for independence in the limited 
space allotted to that period. The author has 
succeeded, however, in making clear the part 
that she played in the great drama of liberty. 

The most interesting portion of the book to 
northern readers is that contained in Parts IV. 
and V., which are devoted to an account of the 
war with Peru and Bolivia, and the civil war 
of 1891. In the former, Mr. Hancock treats 
his subject very impartially, a difficult thing 
to do, for in this war the Chileans were clearly 
the aggressors. After reading Mr. Markham's 
account of the same war, one's sympathies are 
enlisted for the Peruvians, who were mown 
down by hundreds while defending their coun- 
try against a foe whose only excuse for invasion 
was covetousness. And so Mr. Hancock's non- 
committal attitude is the more notable. 

In Part V., which deals with the civil war 
of 1891, President Balmaceda is treated with 
kindly justice. He is given full credit for his 
work as an educator, as a man of advanced re- 
ligious and intellectual views, and as a " good- 
natured gentleman." But his faults are not 
condoned. He is condemned for his blind stub- 
bornness in asserting dictatorial powers, and 
for his wanton cruelty during the war. His 
most politic action was leaving the world when 
he did, for this self-sacrifice in removing him- 
self as the promoter of contention won clem- 
ency toward his followers. 

Mr. Hancock concludes his volume with an 
interesting description of Chile and the Chile- 
ans of to-day. In the appendix are statistics, 
the English text of the constitution of Chile, 
and a full list of authorities on Chilean history. 
It is to be hoped the other volumes in this use- 
ful series will follow rapidly, for we feel assured 
that they will aid us in a solution of the polit- 
ical, commercial, and social problems which 
face us in these republics.

BOOKS ABOUT NATURE.* 



There is nothing like contact with Nature to keep 
the heart warm and young. It is the true elixir of 
life, preserving the freshness, the simplicity, and the 
sweetness of childhood to the farthest limits of old 
age. A love for the flowers, the birds, the clouds 
and the stars, the hills and the seas, for any form 
of wild thing or wild life, is the gift of all others to 
be desired. Who has it can in no case be quite des- 
titute or joyless. To him there will be possibilities 
of comfort and happiness opening up everywhere 
around. A glimpse of the dancing sunshine, a walk 
in the open fields, a handful of blossoms, a snatch 
of untutored song from the hedgerow or tree-top, 
suffices to flood his being with an ecstacy such as 
only they with kindred souls can understand. Abund- 
ant proof of this truth is offered in a series of expe- 
riences just now happily published for the convic- 
tion of mankind. 

The first to fall under my hand is the history of 
"An Island Garden," by Mrs. Celia Thaxter. 
Everybody knows that the home of this writer has 
been for the greater portion of her life in one of 
the Isles of Shoals, lying some nine miles off the 
coast of New Hampshire. Everybody knows, too, 
that here she has distilled from the strong salt breezes 
and the unshadowed sunlight playing round her iso- 
lated habitation, qualities remarkable for the nur- 
ture of an imagination that was inherently of a 
vigorous character. But everybody does not know 
what wonderful stimulus to the health and happi- 
ness of body and mind she has created for herself 
in the cultivation of the vegetable prodigies that 
can be coaxed to grow in a fertile plot of ground. 
At the solicitation of friends, she has unfolded the 
tale in a volume which attracts attention by its 
sumptuous exterior as well as by its unique contents. 
The pictures embellishing it must in the first mo- 
ment be disposed of, for they are by Childe Has- 
sam, whose name is sufficient to pique curiosity. 
They are in colors, and sympathetically illustrate 
the letter-press, furnishing a variety of outdoor and 
indoor views. All are conceived with artistic feel- 
ing, which in most instances is charmingly carried 
out. The minor drawings are likewise graceful and 
suggestive. In harmony with the pictures are the 
various details of the book-maker's art, with a result 
rivalling the volumes de luxe we are used to asso- 
ciate with the holiday period. In the introductory

sentences Mrs. Thaxter strikes a high note which is 
sustained throughout her dissertation. Flowers, she 
declares, have been like dear friends to her from 
her infancy, "comforters, inspirers, powers to up- 
lift and to cheer." The seed from which they 
spring, the dust which nourishes them, were mar- 
vels overpowering her with a sense of magic and 
mystery. Every blade of grass and humble weed 
filled her with awe and delight, and by the age of 
five her fervor of adoration had become like that 
of the fire-worshipper who falls prostrate at the 
presence of the sun. Her intensity of feeling is a 
continual surprise, yet is attended with such dig- 
nity, and leads to such singular and protracted sac- 
rifice for the objects of her regard, that it commands 
admiring respect. An affection that for weeks to- 
gether can call one out of bed at four o'clock in the 
morning; that will hold one to drudging toil from 
that hour on to sunset; that will take one out in 
the lonely darkness of midnight to minister to some 
suffering or imperilled plant; that will induce one 
to bend for many long days in succession over beds 
of flowers to rid them of weeds and worms and bugs ; 
that will, in short, furnish the motive and support 
for incessant work which most persons would pro- 
nounce unbearable drudgery, is of a nature that 
deserves to be called heroic. Such is the love Mrs. 
Thaxter cherishes for her garden a space of only 
fifty feet by fifteen, which yields, as her record 
demonstrates, astonishing fruits to both senses and 
spirit. The flowers are worth all they cost, as an 
inspiration to their owner, who, in the transports of 
emotion they kindle, writes of them with an elo- 
quence which does not pale in comparison with the 
gorgeous passages of Ruskin. She describes the 
California poppy, for example, with an exuberance 
and felicity of diction that justify her daring inser- 
tion of the great master's famous word-painting of 
the red poppy, alongside of it. A brief extract will 
give an indication of her graphic power : 

" As I hold the flower in my hand and think of try- 
ing to describe it, I realize how poor a creature I am, 
how impotent are words in the presence of such perfec- 
tion. It is held upright upon a straight and polished 
stem, its petals curving upward and outward into the 
cup of light, pure gold with a lustrous satin sheen; a 
rich orange is painted on the gold, drawn in infinitely 
fine lines to a point in the centre of the edge of each 
petal, so that the effect is that of a diamond of flame 
in a cup of gold. It is not enough that the powdery 
anthers are orange bordered with gold; they are whirled 
about the very heart of the flower like a revolving Cath- 
erine wheel of fire. In the centre of the anthers is a 
shining point of warm sea-green, a last consummate 
touch which makes the beauty of the blossom supreme. 
Another has the orange suffused through the gold evenly, 
almost to the outer edges of the petals, which are left 
in bright, light yellow with a dazzling effect. Turning 
the flower and looking at it from the outside, it has no 
calyx, but the petals spring from a simple pale-green 
disk, which must needs be edged with sea-shell pink for 
the glory of God ! The fresh splendor of this flower no 
tongue nor pen nor brush of mortal man can fitly re- 
present."

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



An excerpt usually does scant justice to an author ; 
but there are frequent paragraphs and pages in 
" An Island Garden " that one will of necessity 
read aloud to a companion, and will mark and re- 
turn to with ever-renewed enjoyment of their pas- 
sionate ardor and poetic phraseology. Many inter- 
esting notes on the habits of birds in an island home 
are interspersed through the volume. The song 
sparrows scratch up pounds of flower seeds every 
Spring in Mrs. Thaxter's garden, and yet she loves 
them as she does the swallows and the humming 
birds which are as familiar as members of one fam- 
ily in the circumscribed space of Appledore. 

After the brilliant essay on " An Island Garden," 
there is no appreciable decline in turning to "A 
Bird-Lover in the West," by Olive Thome Miller. 
It is pitched in a lower key ; it is quieter in every 
way. But the book has virtues of its own, which 
win the reader's immediate favor. The sane and 
sensible spirit pervading it imparts a healthful im- 
pression. At times the reader is aware how the 
author's pulses are thrilling, yet she retains full con- 
trol over her enthusiasm, not once suffering it to 
escape in strained or hysterical expression. This is 
saying a great deal, for bird-lovers are true lovers, 
and human excitement seldom runs higher than dur- 
ing the gracious interviews they secure with the 
feathered beauties they are wooing. The good sense 
characterizing Mrs. Miller is exhibited in her method 
of enjoying a holiday. It is her custom every year 
in nesting-time to spend a month or more in some 
locality favorable to the study of wild birds. It is 
her season of rest and recreation, and, as she re- 
lates, the instant of departure from home she takes 
herself in hand, determined to cast away care and 
worry and be free to make the most of the precious 
weeks of pastime. 

" To insure any measure of success, I always go alone ; 
one familiar face would make the effort of no avail; and 
I seek a place where I am a stranger, so that my ordinary 
life cannot be recalled to me. When I reach my tem- 
porary home I forget, or at least ignore, my notions as 
to what I shall eat or drink, or how I shall sleep. I 
take the goods the gods provide, and adjust myself to 
them. Even these little things help one out of his old 
ways of thought and life. To still further banish home 
concerns, I mark upon my calendar one week before the 
day I shall start for home, and sternly resolve that not 
until I reach that day will I give one thought to my re- 
turn, but will live as though I meant to stay always. I 
take no work of any sort, and I banish books, excepting 
a few poets and studies of nature. . . . Holding my- 
self in this attitude of mind, I secure a change almost 
as complete as if I stepped out of my body and left it 
resting, while I refreshed myself at the fountain of life." 

These are the words of an energetic, independent 
woman, who is wise enough to discern the right 
way to profit by a summer's outing, and strong 
enough to hold to it in defiance of custom and cir- 
cumstance. The chapters comprising her present 
volume detail the experiences of three seasons spent 
respectively in Utah, Colorado, and Southern Ohio. 
They are bright, piquant narratives, embodying 



the noteworthy incidents occurring in her observa- 
tion of Western birds, among which were the long- 
tailed chat, the water-ouzel, the magpie, the rock- 
wren, the cardinal grosbeak, and blackbirds. Mrs. 
Miller pursues a peculiar mode of study. Arrived 
at her chosen place of research, she adopts a dress 
devoid of conspicuous colors, and, equipped with a 
camp-stool and opera-glass, seeks the spot where 
some pair of enticing songsters have established 
their household. Then, seated in a near sheltering 
thicket, she waits and watches in patient silence to 
note the doings of the unsuspecting couple. The 
hours daily passed in this unremitting investigation 
seldom go by without a due reward. Many new 
and interesting traits of even our common birds have 
been thus detected by Mrs. Miller, who has earned 
an honorable place among naturalists by her orig- 
inal and accurate observations. Naturally, there 
is a mingling of the tragical and the comical in her 
vagrant experiences. An affair amusingly described 
was the sudden intrusion into her secluded thicket 
of a quadriped of the bovine race, which to her 
womanly horror proved to be " no meek cow." There 
could be but one conclusion a rapid and discom- 
fited flight on the part of the observer, who, until 
the end of that special case under study, hired an 
impecunious young college student to sit on guard 
near her retreat, with a club in one hand and a 
geometry he was laboriously mastering grasped 
tightly in the other. 

The sketches " By Moorland and Sea," from the 
pen of Mr. Francis A. Knight, treat, as their title in- 
dicates, of scenes met with in pilgrimages by sea and 
land. The writer is not unknown to us, this being 
the third collection of his papers which has appeared 
in an American reprint from the original English 
edition. A representative of what is best in his 
countrymen, Mr. Knight possesses wide culture and 
refined tastes. With the bent of a naturalist, from 
early boyhood he has scanned the earth with a keen 
searching eye which no feature of out-door life has 
been able to escape. He knows the wild plants in 
their myriad retreats and calls them readily by name, 
and the ways of all creeping and flying things are 
familiar to him as are those of his own kind. Thus, in 
yachting, or camping, or merely sauntering, there 
is no end of incident enlisting his attention, and this 
he transfers to his sketch-book with an easy grace 
that is invariable. He describes the scenery in 
northern Scotland brought into view in a nautical 
trip, the midsummer fields, an old manor-house, the 
birds-nester, and aspects of winter, with minuteness 
and intelligence, causing his readers to see and en- 
joy with him much which they would never have 
discovered of themselves. The illustrations are ad- 
mirably reproduced from drawings or photographs 
done by the author. 

A similar marked type of the English gentleman 
is found in Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye, one of her 
Majesty's dashing soldiers who hunts and fishes, 
zoologizes and poetizes, and finally recounts the 



1894.] 



THE DIAL 



335 



history of it all with equal zest and ability. He has 
scored a fair success in his " Pictures in Prose," a 
book made up of short tales from humble life, and 
descriptions of nature and wild sport. Mr. Trevor- 
Battye has speared the noble salmon in our West- 
ern waters, and hunted the deer and moose in the 
wilds of the Rockies and of British America. 

Another of the odd, limited fraternity who pre- 
fer to anything else in life a stroll or a sojourn in 
some solitary place where wild creatures may be 
surprised and shot, with at least an eye-glance, is 
Dr. Charles Conrad Abbott, the author of several 
volumes of natural history sketches, and of the last 
in the present group, called from the opening piece, 
" Travels in a Tree-top." Dr. Abbott takes mat- 
ters leisurely in observing and in writing, which 
makes the latter just a little heavy. The student 
of nature will go through his books from cover to 
cover for the sake of the scattered remarks that 
add to his stock of coveted lore, but the general 
reader will be apt to complain of his lack of vivac- 
ity and spicy anecdote. SARA A> HUBBABD. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The purpose of Mr. William Ord- 

'.' ***" " way Partridge's " Art for America ' ' 

in art-education. y . 

(Roberts), six essays reprinted from 
the " Arena," the "New England Magazine," etc., is 
" to raise art to its rightful place in the scheme of 
general education." Mr. Partridge's aim is laud- 
able, and much that he says is sound and suggest- 
ive ; but unfortunately his art views have got 
tangled up at the start with his " Americanism." 
The ground-view of his preface seems to be that 
what we are to do as a people, if our art is ever to 
amount to much, is to keep ourselves to ourselves, 
and not rub elbows too freely with other nations. 
This policy, we gather, is a condition precedent of 
the great national art in posse (or in mibibits), 
which, when it finally dawns, is to be, like that other 
impending wonder, " Western Literature," strictly 
unique, and no mere cheap modification of a parent 
stock. Mr. Partridge thinks this art would come 
sooner and be even more unique if we did not travel 
so much. He is quite sharp with us on this text. 
" One of the dangers," he says, " which threatens 
our art, and I may say our manhood, is that of over- 
travel." Mr. Partridge is not alone in this opinion, 
which is pretty frequently advanced in one shape 
or another usually, it may be added, by people 
whose own opportunities for travel have been lim- 
ited. It is generally admitted that the foreigner 
may enlarge and enrich his mind as much as pos- 
sible by travel without thereby endangering his 
status as a citizen and patriot. But with an Amer- 
ican, it seems, the case alters. He loses his pa- 
triotism in proportion as he sheds his provincial- 
ism ; and the further he travels and the more 
he learns, the less likely he is to return a " good 



American " a position, on the whole, not specially 
flattering to the country he started from. To Mr. 
Partridge's notion that an American endangers his 
manhood by taking an occasional trip to Europe, 
we are tempted to reply with Mr. Burchell's favorite 
monosyllable " Fudge ! " Such tourist may pos- 
sibly come back with the un-American conviction 
that London, Paris, and Berlin are better built, bet- 
ter kept, and better ruled than New York, Boston, 
and Chicago ; but this would hardly affect his man- 
hood otherwise than by leading to a useful display 
of it at the primaries. Naturally Mr. Partridge 
disapproves of foreign study for American artists. 
They should, he thinks, stay at home and be " nur- 
tured and developed there." As this view seems 
to involve the theorem that for American artists 
the best place for art-study is the place where the 
advantages for it are fewest, it scarcely needs dis- 
cussion. We suspect these confused notions about 
art-education (which are not peculiar to the author) 
spring from an imperfect view of the fact that art 
is, as Hamerton states it, " at bottom a refined 
handicraft." People are apt to ignore, when they 
talk about the amount of " soul," etc., a painter puts 
into his picture, the part played by the trained eyes 
and fingers. The great artist is the one who to 
great mental gifts joins a consummate mastery of 
his craft of a system of technical processes which 
have nothing at all to do with religion, or morals, 
or patriotism, or Americanism, or any other abstrac- 
tion of the kind whatever. These processes can be 
best learned where they are best taught, and where 
their best results are to be found in the greatest 
profusion that is to say, in the schools and galler- 
ies of Europe ; whither we trust every American 
youth of marked artistic promise may be aided or 
persuaded to betake himself. Mr. Partridge's es- 
says, despite his tendency to soar away from the 
terra firma of plain writing and plain thinking, are 
occasionally sound and coherent; and the publish- 
ers have given them a neat and handy setting. 



The initial numDer of the much her- 

number of the aided " Yellow Book " has appeared, 
" Yellow Book " Messrs. Copeland & Day being the 
American publishers. It is an illustrated quarterly 
magazine, edited by Mr. Henry Harland, and real- 
izing in a measure the suggestion made by Mr. How- 
ells in " A Hazard of New Fortunes." That is, each 
number of the periodical is to be a cloth-bound book, 
complete in itself. In appearance, "The Yellow 
Book " is attractive, except for the cover, upon the 
design of which the imagination of Mr. Aubrey 
Beardsley has been permitted to run riot. Now 
Mr. Beardsley is a very clever young man, and he 
sometimes displays a real mastery of line, but he 
misses as frequently as he hits, and he has distinctly 
missed in the present instance. Illustrations are 
also supplied by Sir Frederic Leighton, TVIr. Joseph 
Pennell, Mr. Laurence Housman, Mr. J. T. Nettle- 
ship, and others. In spite of these names the book 
is something of a disappointment upon the decora-

tive side. Mr. Nettleship's " Head of Minos " is 
the most striking of the pictures. As for paper and 
print, they are exceptionally beautiful, although we 
cannot say that we like the square form of the vol- 
ume. Of the contents, we may first mention the 
poems, which are contributed by Messrs. Le Gal- 
lienne, A. C. Benson, Watson, Symons, Gosse, and 
Davidson. So good a collection of names and pieces 
of verse is not often found within the covers of a 
single issue of any periodical. The prose contents 
open with "The Death of the Lion," a story in the 
subtlest manner of Mr. Henry James. Other im- 
aginative work of high or at least fair quality is con- 
tributed by Miss Ella d'Arcy, Mr. F. M. Simpson, 
and the editor. "The Fool's Hour," caustically 
pleasing, is a play by " John Oliver Hobbes " and 
Mr. George Moore. The serious features are Mr. 
Arthur Waugh's admirable essay on "Reticence in 
Literature," and Dr. Richard Garnett's " The Love- 
Story of Luigi Tansillo," with translations of Tan- 
sillo's sonnets. The contents are filled out by two 
or three other things, entirely insignificant, which 
might better have been omitted. The names that 
we have above enumerated certainly constitute a re- 
markable array, yet the general impression left after 
examination of the book is that not more than two or 
three of them are represented by their better work. 
The sponsors of this new-born periodical have kept 
their promise in excluding " actuality " from its 
pages. There is nothing timely about any of the 
contents as far as subject-matter is concerned. But 
the sort of " actuality " that finds expression in man- 
nerism is abundantly present, and we doubt if the 
beginning of the twentieth century will find this 
volume nearly as readable as we now find it late in 
the nineteenth. We understand that the book has 
had a very large sale. 

Studies in " Studies in the Evolution of En- 

the history of glish Criticism " is the title of a little 
English Criticism. volume of two hundred pages pub- 
lished by Ginn & Co. for Yale University, being 
the doctor's thesis of Miss Laura Johnson Wylie, 
and especially interesting as one of the first results 
of the new policy at Yale of admitting women to 
the graduate school. It is a very creditable piece 
of work, modelled very largely upon M. Brunetiere's 
recent sketch of the history of French criticism 
(" L'Evolution de la Critique "), with some sugges- 
tion also in style and spirit of Bosanquet's " History 
of Esthetic," although this comparison is hardly 
fair to Miss Wylie's less pretentious plan. Consid- 
erable interest has been manifested of recent years 
in the history of criticism, of which this volume is 
the latest evidence. Courses on the subject are be- 
ing conducted at some three or four American uni- 
versities. Professor Schelling's "Poetic and Verse 
Criticism of the Reign of Elizabeth " (University of 
Pennsylvania, 1891 ) considered some of the more 
technical questions connected with the history of 
our early criticism. Miss Wylie's work sketches 
the period that follows from Ben Jonson to Dry- 



den, studies Dryden's criticism more fully, considers 
the course of the evolution out of classicism in the 
eighteenth century, interpolates a section on Ger- 
man aesthetics considered as a source of Coleridge's 
criticism, and ends with an excellent study of Col- 
eridge's critical ideas. Miss Wylie keeps in view 
throughout the period studied the relations of French 
and German to English literature, and aims broadly 
to connect technical literary criticism with the pro- 
gress of critical thought in aesthetics and general 
philosophy. The defect of the work is a somewhat 
over-ambitious attempt to digest and present the 
study of too large a field in too small a space, re- 
sulting in a style of copious and incessant general- 
ization. To the few students who have been over 
precisely the same ground, the work will be sug- 
gestive. To other readers it will prove interesting, 
but elusive and inconclusive. An historical mono- 
graph, perhaps, even when written for specialists, 
should aim at thoroughness and concreteness of dem- 
onstration, rather than at purely suggestive gener- 
alization. 



Field sports 
for women. 



With all our scoffing at the preva- 
lent " Anglomania," the malady must 
be allowed to have had its good re- 
sults. Chief of these, we think, is the inoculation 
of the youth of this land with the English love of 
out-door sports. Thirty years ago, before the ad- 
vent of "Anglomania," no part of the Anglo-Saxon 
world could show on the average (we have Dr. 
Holmes's word for it) so many " black-coated, stiff- 
jointed, soft-muscled, paste-complexioned " young 
men as the cities of our Atlantic seaboard. To most 
of these town-made youths, cricket, boating, boxing, 
riding, one might almost say walking, were not only 
practically unknown, but vulgar like rat-baiting 
and the " ring." " Society," says the Doctor, " would 
drop a man who should run around the Common in 
five minutes." The young people of that day would 
seem to have dawdled mostly in-doors, precocious 
copies of their dyspeptic elders, and not, perhaps, 
altogether unlike their caricatures in " Martin Chuz- 
zlewit." But Fashion, in one of her lucid intervals, 
changed all this. The seeds of " Anglomania," 
winged with her approval, were blown abroad in 
the land ; and it at once became " good form " to 
be athletic. Everybody knows the result. Young 
America to-day easily holds his own in the field, on 
the river, or on the mountain-side, with his cousins 
over-sea ; and one finds nowhere a sounder and 
sightlier race than the present successors of the sed- 
entary youths admonished by Dr. Holmes. Not the 
least hopeful feature of it all is that the really " up- 
to-date " American girl is no whit behind her brothers 
in this wholesome taste for fresh air and exercise ; 
and it is to her that the pretty volume before us, 
" Ladies in the Field " (Appleton), is specially com- 
mended. It contains thirteen "sketches of sport," 
reminiscent and instructive : " Riding in Ireland 
and' India," by Lady Greville ; " Horses and their 
Riders," by the Duchess of Newcastle ; " Fox-

and America. 



Hunting" and "Team and Tandem Driving," by 
Miss Rosie Anstruther Thomson ; " Covert Shoot- 
ing," hy Lady Boynton ; " Tigers I have Shot," hy 
Mrs. Martelli ; etc. The sketches are all vivaciously 
and entertainingly written, and we have no doubt 
they are instructive in their way. 

Mr. Enoch A. Bryan's " The Mark 
in Europe and America" (Ginn) is 
an illustration of zeal without suffi- 
cient knowledge. It may be harsh to judge it by 
the following: " So, taking the England of Domes- 
day and Domesday was said to include every yard 
of land in it," yet this is an indication of the mislead- 
ing character of the book. The controversy of the 
" Germanists " and the " Romanists " in regard to the 
mark is set forth with ample reverence for Seebohm 
and Coulanges, but with scant courtesy for their 
opponents; the attempt to get up a battle over " the 
mark in America " savors to an outsider of a per- 
sonal reminiscence of Harvard vs. Johns Hopkins 
in scholastic rivalry ; and the closing effort to show 
that the mark theory is a fruitful source of danger 
in economic discussion as conducted by Henry 
George indicates a lack of historical insight into 
the forward movement of society which Mr. Bryan 
contends for eagerly. The argumentation on pages 
32 and 33, that because agri are mentioned along 
with homes and occupations as in possession, they 
must be holden in severalty, shows an unf amiliarity 
with early forms of expression ; and the transla- 
tion on page 35 of the much interpreted classic 
passage from the " Germania " beginning "Agri 
pro numero," fails to explain the crux of the whole 
passage " in vices." The real value of the book 
lies alone in its emphasis of the truth that commun- 
ity of action and a certain equality are proof " neither 
of freedom nor of the common ownership of any- 
thing," which the author illustrates happily from 
the condition of the plantation negro before the 
Civil War. The truth is, however, slowly being rec- 
ognized in the literature of land tenures in England 
that an eclecticism between the extremes of Kem- 
ble and Seebohm is a safer ground than partisan- 
ship.

of "Junius." Q ne ig a i ways fancying that the de- 
bate as to the authorship of the vituperative and 
over-rated Letters is settled, and being unexpectedly 
roused to the fact that it is n't by the appearance of 
a fresh disputant armed with fresh " proofs " and as 
full of the ardor of battle as if the matter were of 
yesterday- To a plain man interested in the life 
about him it may seem that the " Junius " question 
is relatively a trivial one. But he should remember 
that there is always a class of disputatious yet schol- 
arly minds to whom the gravity of a question is in 
inverse ratio to its bearing on contemporary life and 
action. To some of these minds the riddle set by 
North's and Grafton's masked heckler has an absorb- 
ing interest, and they would probably go on debating 



it even were the society in which they live and have 
their being in the throes of dissolution. The latest 
QEdipus to present himself with a solution of the 
mystery is Mr. H. R. Francis, a grandson of Sir 
Philip Francis. Nine out of ten students of the 
subject are satisfied that Sir Philip was "Junius" ; 
but to make, as he hopes, assurance doubly sure, and 
to clinch, as we hope, the matter for all time, Mr. 
Francis, in his "'Junius' Revealed" (Longmans), 
recapitulates his ancestor's case and adds some new 
and cogent evidence in point. Mr. Francis writes 
clearly and argues closely ; and his book is certainly 
one which those interested in its topic should have. 
Several facsimile writings tending to establish Sir 
Philip's authorship of the letters are appended. 



National 
literature 
of Ireland. 



A neat and inexpensive volume, of 
especial interest to thoughtful Irish- 
men, is " The Revival of Irish Litera- 
ture " (London : T. Fisher Unwin), containing four 
occasional addresses by Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, 
Dr. George Sigerson, and Dr. Douglas Hyde. The 
aim of the writers is the promotion of a higher sense 
of Irish unity, and of a reverence for and familiarity 
with the national literature and history. It may 
be noted in passing that Sir Charles Duffy finds 
that the books now chiefly read by the young in 
Ireland are " detective or other sensational stories 
from England and America." We did not know 
that the wares of our own book-making Fagins had 
travelled so far. This noxious trash (the purvey- 
ors of which are at least as criminal as the crimin- 
als they form and educate) Sir Charles hopes to 
drive out by making generally accessible in popu- 
lar libraries good books by native authors such 
books as are " fit to win and fascinate young Irish 
readers," and "make them better men and better 
Irishmen." We need hardly say that the present 
volume appeals to Irish reason rather than Irish 
passions ; and that it is free from the inflammatory 
stuff ladled out by the class of agitators the real goal 
of whose " patriotic " endeavors is the pocket-books 
of their too-trusting countrymen.

of its marked features is an almost complete absence 
of references to other modern treatises, although, as 
the author assures us in his preface, he has worked 
through and profited by the somewhat voluminous 
literature of his subject. Per contra, the original 
sources of information are cited and discussed in 
elaborate foot-notes, which fill more than half, on 
the average, of each page of text. Eight plates 
of illustrations, from ancient paintings, sculptures, 
coins, etc., complete the apparatus of the volume. 
These illustrations have been copied, not in the usual 
fashion, from the compilations, too often untrust- 
worthy, of predecessors in the same field, but from 
the most authentic sources, often from casts, with 
much conscientious verification. Although the sub-

ranean, the lion's share of attention falls to Greece. 
There are few men competent to pronounce a de- 
tailed judgment on Mr. Torr's book, but we do not 
hesitate to recommend " Ancient Ships " as simply 
indispensable to any who wish to grapple in earnest 
with the subject. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have given a charmingly 
dainty setting to the rather vapid little " Journal of Mar- 
tha Pintard Bayard." Mrs. Bayard was the wife of 
Judge Samuel Bayard (one might almost say " of that 
ilk") who was appointed by Washington in 1794 as 
agent to prosecute, under the Jay treaty, the claims of 
American citizens in the British Admiralty courts. The 
present volume records Mrs. Bayard's English impres- 
sions. There are two portraits. 

Mr. Volney M. Spalding's " Guide to the Study of 
Common Plants " (Heath) is a text-book for high school 
grades. It is based upon the laboratory method, and 
provides a series of exercises that cover the most im- 
portant types of plant life. The cryptogamous groups 
get but few of these exercises, although quite as many 
as it is desirable to require of the beginner. Seven or- 
ders of endogens and twenty orders of exogens are illus- 
trated by one or more species each. The treatment is 
suggestive, and well calculated to direct attention to 
the essential characteristics of the forms taken up for 
study. 

M. Fre'de'ric Houssay's " The Industries of Animals " 
(imported by Scribner), is published in the " Contem- 
porary Science " series. This English adaptation of a 
French work has been prepared with the cooperation of 
the author, but the name of the translator, for some un- 
explained reason, does not appear. It consists of chap- 
ters on such subjects as the dwellings of animals, their 
hunting, fishing, methods of defence, their care of the 
young, and the sanitation of their hives, nests, or other 
dwellings. The illustrations are mostly from Herr 
Brehm's " Thierleben." 

John Larkin Lincoln (1817-1891) was for many years 
a professor in Brown University. His son, Mr. William 
E. Lincoln, has prepared, with pious care, a memorial vol- 
ume which cannot fail to possess the deepest interest for 
the friends of the scholar who is its subject, and which 
is not without a certain value for others. It includes a 
memorial address by Professor George P. Fisher, ex- 
tracts from Lincoln's diaries and letters, and a selection 
of his most important papers. In these, classical themes 
predominate, although we find also such modern subjects 
as " Faust," " Galileo and the Inquisition," " James Clerk 
Maxwell," and " The Historian Leopold von Ranke." 
The book is handsomely published by Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. 

A Congress of Jewish Women was one of the many 
gatherings held in Chicago last summer, and the papers 
of this Congress, of which Mrs. Hannah G. Solomon was 
chairman, are now put forth in a substantial volume by 
the Jewish Publication Society of America. Among 
the subjects discussed are " Jewish Women of Biblical 
and of Mediaeval Times," " Women Wage- Workers," 
" Mission Work among the Unenlightened Jews," and 
" How Can Nations Be Influenced to Protest or Interfere 
in Cases of Persecution ? " 



" The Struggle of Protestant Dissenters for Religious 
Toleration in Virginia," by Dr. Henry R. Mcllwaine, is 
the latest of the " Johns Hopkins University Studies in 
Historical and Political Science." The period covered by 
this treatise begins with the year 1649 and extends to 
the close of the French and Indian War. The Quakers, 
the Huguenots, and the Presbyterians were the princi- 
pal dissenting sects whose struggles the author describes 
and whose incomplete victory he records. 

A new edition of " Owen Meredith's " " Lucile," and 
a selection from his poems by Lady Betty Balfour, have 
been published in two handsome and uniform volumes 
(Longmans). The " Lucile" includes the preface to the 
third edition, in which the author defended himself 
against the charge of plagiarism. The other volume 
has a lengthy introduction by Lady Balfour. She gives 
us selections from all of her father's books except " The 
Wanderer " (which has been republished in a volume by 
itself), "Orval" (which no one cares to remember), 
" Marah," and " King Poppy." There are also a few 
hitherto unpublished poems. 

The book for boys that is made to order is not as a 
general thing to be encouraged, but an exception to this 
rule must be made in the case of Mr. Andrew Lang's 
" Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia " (Longmans), which is 
a sequel to his charming " Prince Prigio." If we are 
not greatly out of the reckoning, this book will become 
a prime favorite, not only with the boys for whom it 
is written, but also with those children of a larger 
growth who enjoy artistic nonsense. It is quite worthy 
to stand on the shelf beside the history of Alice in Won- 
derland. 

The " Religion of Science " library (Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co.), which consists of bi-monthly reprints of 
independent works, completes its first year by the publi- 
cation of M. Alfred Bluet's " The Psychic Life of Micro- 
Organisms." " The Diseases of Personality " and " The 
Psychology of Attention," by M. T. Ribot, have preceded 
this issue, the three other numbers for the year having 
been Dr. Carus's " The Religion of Science," and two 
sets of lectures by Professor Max Muller. These books 
are all of decided value, and place before the public, at 
a low price, some of the most important results of recent 
scientific investigation. 

Teachers of the modern languages will be glad to have 
their attention called to three recent publications of Mr. 
W. R. Jenkins. " Short Selections for Translating En- 
glish into French " is a useful manual by M. Paul Bercy. 
" Le Franc.ais par la Conversation," by M. Charles P. 
DuCroquet, is for those who think there is such a thing 
as learning French by chatter. The " Contes de Balzac," 
edited by Dr. George M. Harper and Mr. Louis E. 
Livingood, makes one of the best possible reading books 
for advanced classes. It includes " Une Passion dans 
le Desert," " Un Episode sous la Terreur," " Le Colonel 
Chabert," and three other stories. From Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. we have a " Short French Grammar " and 
a companion pamphlet of " French Lessons and Exer- 
cises," both by Mr. C. H. Grandgent, and both deserv- 
ing of the highest praise. Among strictly elementary 
works, we know of nothing better for American schools 
than this " Grammar." The same publishers send us 
an Italian text Gherardi del Testa's " L'Oro e POr- 
pello" edited by Mr. C. H. Thurber. 

The "Temple " Shakespeare (Macmillan), to be pub- 
lished on the play-a-volume plan, is so attractive that 
we hardly see how it could be improved upon. It has 
the Dent imprint, with all the qualities of tastefulness

that the name implies. The Cambridge text is used ; 
the brief prefaces, notes, and glossaries are by Mr. Israel 
Gollancz ; and each volume is to have a frontispiece. 
" The Tempest " is the first volume to appear, and has 
the Droeshout portrait. The volumes will be issued in 
the first folio order. A special edition for students, with 
extra wide margins, is also announced. 

The Hon. F. Levesen Gower has edited and published 
in two handsome octavo volumes (Longmans), the let- 
ters of his mother, Harriet, Countess Granville. The 
letters extend from 1810 to 1845, and are nearly all 
addressed to the writer's brother and sister, the Duke 
of Devonshire and Lady Morpeth. Most of the letters 
are written from Paris, where Lord Granville represented 
his country for many years. They are rich in remin- 
iscences of social life in the early part of the century, 
and abound in anecdotes of well-known characters. 

" A Child's History of Spain " is Mr. John Bonner's 
latest addition to his historical series (Harper), and 
maintains the high character of its predecessors. It 
begins with 500 B. C., and ends with a description of 
Spain's present social and industrial conditions, which, 
after a lethargy of a hundred years, now begin to show 
marked signs of prosperity. The oft-told story of the 
Spanish discovery by Columbus, the dramatic tales of 
the Spanish conquests by Cortez and Pizarro, and the 
lives of the Spanish heroes Iturbide and Bolivar, are all 
given with a freshness and spirit that will render them 
highly attractive to readers of all ages. 

Volume III. of Professor H. Grsetz's " History of the 
Jews " (Jewish Publication Society) carries the narra- 
tive from the revolt against the Zendiks in 511 A. D. to 
the capture of St. Jean d'Acre by the Mohammedans 
in 1291. Among the topics discussed are the Jews in 
Arabia, the golden age of Jewish culture in Spain, the 
persecutions incident to the Crusades, the career of 
Maimonides, and the rise of the Kabbala. The work is 
well printed, and written in readable style. 

Teachers of the English language and literature will 
be interested in Mr. Alfred S. West's " Elements of 
English Grammar " (Macmillan), a simple and well- 
planned text-book for boys and girls ; in the pretty edi- 
tion of Addison's " Sir Roger de Coverley Papers " 
(Houghton), which has just been anonymously edited 
for the " Riverside Literature" series; and in Mr. El- 
mer E. Wentworth's attractive annotated edition for 
school use of the " Sketch Book " of Washington Irv- 
ing (Allyn & Bacon). 

A critical edition of Lamb's " Specimens of English 
Dramatic Poets " has long been needed, and Mr. Israel 
Gollancz now supplies it (Macmillan). There are two 
volumes, and the Dent imprint is an assurance of care- 
ful as well as tasteful mechanical workmanship. Mr. 
Gollancz has incorporated the " Garrick Extracts " with 
the " Specimens " proper, and arranged the whole chron- 
ologically. He has also corrected erroneous statements, 
supplied dates, revised the texts, and identified the 
" Fragments " no mean task, the latter. The edition 
is limited, although not narrowly. 

"The Skeptics of the French Renaissance" (Mac- 
millan), by Mr. John Owen, continues the author's com- 
panion volume devoted to the Italians, even the pagina- 
tion being consecutive. The pleasant method of essay 
interspersed with dialogue is also preserved. The sub- 
jects of the chapters are Montaigne and Pascal, Char- 
ron and Sanchez, Peter Ramus and La Mothe-le-Vayer. 
The indices to the work are unusually full and helpful. 



YORK TOPICS. 



New York, May 28, 1894. 

One of the noteworthy recent importations of Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons who, by the way, have finally 
removed to their new building in Fifth avenue is Esther 
Wood's " Dante Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite Move- 
ment," the most concise and complete biography of Ros- 
setti which has yet appeared. Mrs. Wood disclaims 
attempting a final biography, quoting Hall Caine's state- 
ment that the one person capable of doing this is Mr. 
Theodore Watts, who was Rossetti's chief confidant in 
his later years. At the same time she has collected and 
arranged in a well-considered order all the information 
at hand, and has added to this some interesting remin- 
iscences of class-room and studio life, and of the Pre- 
Raphaelites at Oxford, unpublished before. The book 
contains several fine reproductions of Rossetti's paint- 
ings. 

Almost simultaneously with the appearance of this 
volume comes the May number of " The Portfolio," with 
Mr. F. G. Stephens's monograph on Rossetti, with a 
number of reproductions of his pictures not so well 
made as might be expected in an art-periodical of this 
character. Some of the more important pictures are 
not given, I know not whether on account of copyright 
prohibition in England or because they are so familiar 
there. The omission is a marked one, however. Mr. 
Stephens is art-critic of " The Athenaeum," and was one 
of the original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, it will be 
remembered. His monograph contains new anecdotes 
of the group. The author is slightly aggressive in his 
exposition of Rossetti's influence on younger poets and 
painters, an influence long since admitted, it should 
be said that Mr. Stephens probably has a keen recollec- 
tion of the time when almost every hand was turned 
against himself and his brother " Pre-Raphs." 

Among the more important English poets whose verse 
in some degree is indebted to the influence of Rossetti, 
Mr. Eugene Lee-Hamilton may be counted. At the 
same time he has an independent note of his own, this 
being only one phase of his poetry. For over twenty 
years Mr. Lee-Hamilton has been the victim of a spinal 
trouble, unable to read or write or to be read to, and 
without the power of locomotion. His " Poems and 
Transcripts," " The New Medusa," " Apollo and Mar- 
syas," etc., have been dictated to an amanuensis under 
these conditions; and they have made a decided mark 
in the literary world. Some sonnets, also, have appeared 
in " The Athenaeum " and elsewhere, and these, with 
many more, will be published in a volume called " Son- 
nets of the Wingless Hours" by Messrs. Stone & Kim- 
ball, who have kindly permitted me to copy a few of 
them for THE DIAL. The book seems to me the most 
noteworthy of its kind which has appeared since the 
publication of William Watson's " Epigrams " in 1884. 
Strange to relate, with the preparation of this book, 
which is in part an epitome of its author's tragic exist- 
ence, the hours have again taken wings for him ; he is 
able once more to read and write, and is hopeful of a 
happy recovery. He has lived all these years at a farm- 
villa, " II Palmerino," near Florence, where his half- 
sister, Miss Violet Paget (" Vernon Lee "), has devoted 
herself to him with unceasing attention. Readers of the 
sonnets quoted will be interested to compare the one en- 
titled " What the Sonnet Is " with Mr. Gilder's " What 
is a Sonnet ? " and with the sonnets by Rossetti and older 
poets on the same subject.

[June 1, 



TO THE MUSE. 

To keep through life the posture of the grave, 
While others walk and run and dance and leap ; 
To keep it ever, waking or asleep, 

While shrink the limbs that Nature goodly gave ; 

In summer's heat no more to breast the wave ; 

No more to wade through seeded grasses deep ; 

Nor tread the cornfield where the reapers reap ; 
Nor stretch free limbs beneath a leafy nave : 

'Tis hard, 't is hard ; and so in winter too, 

'Tis hard to hear no more the sweet faint creak 
Of the crisp snow, the frozen earth's clear ring, 

Where ripe blue sloes and crimson berries woo 

The hopping redbreast. But when thou dost seek 
My lonely room, sweet Muse, Despair takes wing. 

SEA -SHELL MURMURS. 

The hollow sea-shell which for years hath stood 
On dusty shelves, when held against the ear 
Proclaims its stormy parent ; and we hear 

The faint far murmur of the breaking flood. 

We hear the sea. The sea ? It is the blood 
In our own veins, impetuous and near. 
And pulses keeping pace with hope and fear 

And with our feelings' every shifting mood. 

Lo, in my heart I hear, as in a shell, 

The murmur of a world beyond the grave, 
Distinct, distinct, though faint and far it be. 

Thou fool ; this echo is a cheat as well, 

The hum of earthly instincts ; and we crave 
A world unreal as the shell-heard sea. 

WHAT THE SONNET IS. 

Fourteen small broidered berries on the hem 

Of Circe's mantle, each of magic gold ; 

Fourteen of lone Calypso's tears that roll'd 
Into the sea, for pearls to come of them ; 

Fourteen clear signs of omen in the gem 
With which Medea human fate foretold ; 
Fourteen small drops, which Faustus, growing old, 

Craved of the Fiend, to water Life's dry stem. 

It is the pure white diamond Dante brought 

To Beatrice ; the sapphire Laura wore 
When Petrarch cut it sparkling out of thought ; 

The ruby Shakespeare hewed from his heart's core ; 

The dark deep emerald that Rossetti wrought 
For his own soul, to wear forevermore. 

BAUDELAIRE. 

A Paris gutter of the good old times, 

Black and putrescent in its stagnant bed, 
Save where the shamble oozings fringe it red, 

Or scaffold trickles, or nocturnal crimes. 

It holds dropped gold ; dead flowers from tropic climes ; 

Gems true and false, by midnight maskers shed ; 

Old pots of rouge ; old broken phials that spread 
Vague fumes of musk, with fumes from slums and slimes. 

And everywhere, as glows the set of day, 

There floats upon the winding fetid mire 
The gorgeous iridescence of decay : 

A wavy film of color, gold and fire, 

Trembles all through it as you pick your way, 
And streaks of purple that are straight from Tyre. 

1 From Stone & Kimball also come the first two num- 
bers of "The Chap-Book," a dainty little semi-monthly 
publication devoted to literary criticism, poetry, aud fic- 
tion, by approved and by unknown writers. For the 
second number, just about to be published, Mrs. Moul- 



ton contributes a quatrain; Mr. Richard Henry Stod- 
dard reviews Gilbert Parker's " A Lover's Diary " at 
some length and most appreciatively; a poem by Bliss 
Carman, "The Prayer in the Rose Garden," is given; 
there is a story by Pereival Pollard ; and there are one 
or two entertaining " skits." The combination of taste 
and energy shown by this young firm is characteristic 
of the time, and will not be without results.

TjITERARY NOTES A1STD MISCELLANY. 

Mr. Blackmore's " Perlycross " is just about to appear 
from the press of Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Mr. E. C. Stedman's " Victorian Anthology," illus- 
trating his " Victorian Poets," will be published in the 
autumn. 

The English Spenser Society, after twenty-six years 
of activity, has published its farewell volume, a reprint 
of Heywood's " The Spider and the Flie." 

The D. Van Nostrand Co. have nearly ready " Mod- 
ern Methods of Sewage Disposal," by Colonel G. E. 
Waring, Jr. ; and " New Roads and Road Laws in the 
United States," by Mr. Roy Stone. 

The double summer number of " Poet-Lore " will con- 
tain an exceptionally interesting series of articles, among 
them being: "Saga Literature," by Mr. J. H. Wisby; 
" Einar Christiansen," by Professor D. K. Dodge; and 
" Literature and the Scientific Spirit," by Professor L. 
A. Sherman. 

The annual report of the trustees of Shakespeare's 
birthplace shows that there were 18,000 paid admissions 
in 1893 materially fewer than in 1892. The falling 
off is ascribed to the depression in America and to the 
Chicago exhibition. The report shows an adverse bal- 
ance of 697. 

The large body of literature attributed to Paracelsus 
will be included in unabridged form, and in English, in 
two volumes, to be brought out in London. They will 
bear the title " The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings 
of Paracelsus." The text from which the translation 
has been made is that of the Geneva folio of 1658 in 
Latin. 

In a recent magazine article, " Mark Twain " told of 
the discovery of his " Jumping Frog " story in a Greek 
text-book, the inference being that the story had a clas- 
sical prototype. But the resemblance was so striking 
that it proved too much, and now Professor Sidgwick, 
who prepared the text-book in question, states that he 
took the story straight from its American source, merely 
to use it as an exercise for translation into Greek. 

Mr. John Seymour Wood is to be the editor of a new 
monthly magazine published at New York in the interest 
of college men in particular and the public in general. 
We are told that the magazine will cover all matters of 
interest to college graduates in art, literature, politics, 
and athletics, that Mr. Albert Stickney will contribute 
articles on political and economic questions, and that 
Mr. W. D. Howells will write literary critiques. 

Messrs. Houghton Mifflin & Co. have just issued a 
pamphlet entitled " Good Literature." It is divided into 
three parts. The first part contains the opinions of em- 
inent men who favor the use of literature in schools. 
In part two are given the methods of using literature 
adopted by a number of educators. The third part con- 
tains a graded list of literary masterpieces suitable for

school use. There is an interesting introduction to the 
whole, showing what the aim of the publishers has been 
in supplying good literature in a cheap form. 

Mr. James Tomkinson has edited the diary of his 
father, William Tomkinson, who served in the Penin- 
sular and Waterloo campaigns (Macmillan). The gen- 
eral reader will take slight interest in this unpretentious 
record of a soldier's life, but it undoubtedly has value 
as a document, even at this late day. The volume is 
illustrated with maps and engraved portraits. 

" The pictures they publish of me," says Mr. R. L. 
Stevenson, " vary considerably. They represent every 
type from the most godlike creatures to the criminal 
classes ; and their descriptions of me vary in proportion 
from a man with a ' noble bearing ' to a ' blighted 
boy.' I don't mind what they say as a general rule, 
only I did object when somewhere in the States an in- 
terviewer wrote, ' A tall willowy column supported his 
classic head, from which proceeded a hacking cough.' 
I could not forgive that ! " This amusing paragraph 
is taken from " The English Illustrated Magazine." 

The following plaint of an aggrieved writer appears 
in the New York " Critic ": "Six years ago I wrote an 
article on the education of women for a New York mag- 
azine, which was accepted. This year my request to be 
allowed to see my article again was granted, and on 
reading it over I found it so absolutely behind the times 
changes in regard to women have been going on so 
rapidly that I have been obliged to write it completely 
over again. I have now returned my manuscript to the 
editor with the request that he forward it to me every 
six years, in order that I may keep it up to a decent 
standard of timeliness ! " 

" The Canadian Bookseller " for April contains some 
interesting statistics. During 1893, the total number 
of copyrights registered throughout the Dominion was 
449, of which only ten were novels. The total value 
of books, etc., imported during the year was $890,000, 
the United States contributing $476,000, as compared 
with $327,000 from great Britain. English authors 
will be more interested to learn that the imports of 
copyright books, on which they are supposed to receive 
a royalty of 12 per cent ad valorem, amounted to only 
$13,000. Under the new tariff it is proposed to abol- 
ish the collection of this royalty, and to impose a uni- 
form duty on all books (other than music, maps, and 
prints) of six cents per pound avoirdupois. 

" The Independent " closes an interesting account of 
the recently discovered Hymn to Apollo with the fol- 
lowing suggestion, which we heartily endorse : " The 
glory of having unearthed these precious musical frag- 
ments at Delphi would to-day belong to the American 
School of Classical Studies at Athens, had the $80,000 
necessary for the Delphi excavations been raised in 
America more promptly. Let the past supply lessons 
for the present. The American School has just received 
the privilege from the Greek Government of excavating 
the northern slope of the Acropolis at Athens, where the 
most important public buildings of the ancient city are un- 
doubtedly buried under fifty feet of earth. It is to be 
hoped that the friends of classical learning and culture 
in America will be more prompt this time with their 
subscriptions." 

" The Pall Mall Budget " reports a remarkable liter- 
ary discovery by " an advanced Baconian." The writer 
proves (cryptographically speaking) that Bacon, the 
great originator of all the English literature of his age, 



was also the author of "Box and Cox." This he sets 
forth from the back of the first edition, where the name 

of the play is printed 

HOX 
AND 
COX 

These columns read from top to bottom, give BACON 
OXDX. Here the author not only actually signed his 
own name, but gave the date also; for, taking out the 
letters that have a numerical value, we have CXDX, 
which, added, give 620. This stands for 1620, the date 
of the " Novum Organum " and without doubt of " Box 
and Cox " also. 

A Walt Whitman Society, with Mr. Horace L. Trau- 
bel as secretary, has been planned, and is just now per- 
fecting its permanent organization. Its objects are: 
1. The consolidation within a single organization of all 
persons who are interested in the life and work of Walt 
Whitman. 2. The establishment of Centres in differ- 
ent parts of the world, which shall bring together the 
lovers and admirers of Whitman, and which, by the 
maintenance of correspondence and the exchange of 
views, shall tend to close fraternal relations among the 
members of the Society. 3. The publication, from time 
to time, of Whitman literature and of such essays and 
other papers as may be deemed valuable in elucidation 
of Whitman's philosophy of life, or in exposition of his 
poetry and principles. 

Miss Emily James Smith, a fellow in the department 
of Greek of the University of Chicago, has just been 
elected to the deanship of Barnard College, and will 
enter upon the duties of that responsible position in the 
fall. As a classical scholar, Miss Smith is probably un- 
surpassed by any woman in the country. She studied 
under Professor Shorey at Bryn Mawr from 1885 to 
1889, under Professor Jebb at Cambridge during the 
following year, then taught for two years in the Packer 
Institute of Brooklyn, and for the past year has been 
working once more under Professor Shorey, at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. She published a volume of " Se- 
lections from Lucian " two or three years ago, and will 
also be remembered as the author of "The Hungry 
Greeklings," a brilliant paper recently contributed to 
" The Atlantic Monthly." 

The Association for the Encouragement of Greek 
Studies, of Paris, has lately given, in the amphitheatre 
at the Beaux- Arts, a performance of the Hymn to Apollo 
which was brought to light last year at Delphi, with the 
music to which it was originally set. This is the first 
time that any important piece of Greek music has ever 
been reproduced. Much has been known of the esteem 
in which music was held among the Greeks, but very 
little has been known of the Greek music. The inform- 
ation to be drawn from ancient writers on the subject 
is quite sterile, and, as M. Theodore Reinach said in a 
lecture which preceded the hymn, it is no more possible 
to judge of Greek music from their works than it would 
be to get a clear idea of Greek architecture out of Vit- 
ruvius. It was known that the acquaintance of the 
Greeks with harmony and instrumentation was no more 
than rudimentary ; in polyphony they did not go beyond 
two-part singing. On the other hand they had three 
modes the Lydian, Phrygian, and Dorian where we 
have only the major and minor. It is in the Dorian 
mode, the most incontestably Greek of the three, that 
the newly found hymn is written. From the hymn it 
appears that the Greeks had two methods of musical no- 
tation, using either geometrical signs, or letters. They 
had no musical staff, and the sign was written over its 



342 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



word. When the same note came twice, or more times, 
in succession, only one sign was used, that is, it was 
not repeated. Twenty-eight lines of the hymn have 
been recovered, and eighty measures of the music. Mme. 
Remade was the singer of it, giving it first in Greek 
and then in French. For the accompaniment, the ci- 
thara and the flute of the Greeks were replaced by a harp, 
and the clarinette register of a harmonium. M. Rein- 
ach, in his lecture, promised the audience a " jouissance 
delicate et aigue." The first impression of the hear- 
ers seems to have justified the last adjective. The 
music is written in a five-eight time, strange to modern 
ears. But the ears soon grew accustomed to this, and 
even found some charm in it; and delight followed. 
The hymn was discovered in the Athenian treasury at 
Delphi, where the French School of Archaeology have 
been making excavations. It was engraved on marble 
slabs. The treasury itself was a small building, erected 
by the Athenians just after Marathon, to receive the 
offerings sent to the great temple at Delphi, in the close 
neighborhood of which it is situated. The Greek of the 
hymn has been put into French by MM. Thdodore Rein- 
ach and Georges d'Eichthal. 

A PROPOSED TENNYSON MEMORIAL. 

Mr. Douglas W. Freshfield, of Freshwater, Isle of 
Wight, is circulating the following appeal among the 
American public: 

" As a member and at the request of the local com- 
mittee appointed for the erection of a memorial to the 
late Poet Laureate in this place his home for forty 
years I write to ask your aid in making general the 
character of the monument selected. It has been de- 
cided to erect on the highest crest of the down over- 
looking the western end of the island, and between the 
roads of Farringford and the English Channel, a gran- 
ite monolith in the form of an lona cross. The design 
will be furnished by Mr. Pearson, R.A. With the per- 
mission of the authorities of the Trinity House, who 
propose to change the name of the landmark from the 
Nodes Beacon to the Tennyson Beacon, the present 
structure, a pile of tarred wood, erected last year, will 
be removed and its place taken by the cross. The spot 
chosen, the ' ridge of the noble down ' Tennyson loved, 
will, I believe, recommend itself to his friends, and the 
companions of his daily walks. As a land and sea mark, 
in view of every ship that passes in or out of the Needles, 
or under the island, the beacon cross should form a con- 
spicuous and fitting memorial to one of England's great 
poets. 

" A considerable sum has already been subscribed lo- 
cally and among the late Lord Tennyson's friends. But 
more money is needed to make the monument what it 
should be in scale and finish. There must be many both 
in England and America who would wish to be contrib- 
utors to this memorial. I am desired to ask all such 
to be good enough to forward their contributions before 
July 1 next to the Rev. J. Merriman, D.D., Freshwater, 
Isle of Wight, by whom they will be at once acknowl- 
edged. A complete subscription list will be sent in due 
course to every subscriber." 

In this connection it is interesting to note that the 
memorial to Keats, provided by the efforts of an Amer- 
ican Committee headed by Mr. F. Holland Day, has 
taken the form of a marble bust of the poet, which is 
soon to be unveiled in the parish church at Hempstead. 
About one hundred American men of letters and artists 
defrayed the cost of this memorial.

NEW WORKS OF FICTION. 



By STANLEY J. WEYMAN. 

Under the Red Robe. 

A Romance. With 12 full-page Illustrations by R. 
CATON WOODVILLE. 12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

"Mr. Weyman's new novel takes us again to France ; and 
this time it is to France under the Red Robe of Cardinal 
Richelieu. ... It is interesting, in comparing this romance 
with its predecessor, 'A Gentleman of France,' . . . to note 
certain striking points of similarity in such dissimilar books. 
In each case a person of high rank is to be taken prisoner for 
political reasons, and to be conveyed under guard to the Cap- 
ital. In each case the man delegated to the task is a gentle- 
man whose life or fortune hangs upon the successful perform- 
ance of his dangerous mission ; and in each case it is this man 
who tells the story of the adventure, and of the way the he- 
roine learns to love him. With such essential features in 
common, the two narratives are yet so managed that these 
resemblances seem only casual. It is a point in art, then, that 
the author should be able to construct two successive books 
upon such like themes. It is interesting, too, to set side by 
side the heroes of the two novels. Such comparison shows 
that Mr. Weyman knows well how to discriminate varieties 
of bravery. . . . Mr. Weyman's heroes are not run from the 
stock mold, nor from any one mold. They neither look nor 
act alike. But . . . though they are cast in different molds 
the metal is still the same bravery of a thoroughly mascu- 
line kind. The author is an artist in character as well as in 
plot, or, to put it specifically, he is an artist in making his 
plot portray his characters, and his characters carry on his 
plot. To this skill in construction, this insight into people, 
add the choice of stirring themes, and the charm of a fresh, 
direct style, and the elements of Mr. Weyman's success are 
evident." Critic. 

" As perfect a novel of the new school of fiction as ' Ivan- 
toe ' or ' Henry Esmond ' was of theirs. Each later story has 
shown a marked advance in strength and treatment, and in 
the last Mr. Weyman . . . demonstrates that he has no su- 
perior among living novelists. . . . There are but two char- 
acters in the story his art makes all other but unnoticed 
shadows cast by them and the attention is so keenly fixed 
upon one or both, from the first word to the last, that we live 
in their thoughts and see the drama unfolded through their 
eyes." World, New York. 

A Gentleman of France. 

Being the Memoirs of Gaston de Bonne, Sieur de Mar- 
sac. With Frontispiece and Vignette by H. J. FORD. 
12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

" A delightful love story. The interest of the reader is con- 
stantly excited by the development of unexpected turns in 
the relation of the principal lovers. The romance lies against 
a background of history truly painted. . . . The descrip- 
tions of the court life of the period and of the factional strifes, 
divisions, hatreds of the age, are fine. . . . Worthy of a 
very high place among historical novels of recent years." 
Public Opinion. 

The House of the Wolf. 

A Romance. With Frontispiece and Vignette by 
CHARLES KERR. 12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

" A romance which deserves a place in literature alongside 
of Charles Reade's ' Cloister and Hearth.' " Commercial 
Advertiser, New York. 



By EDNA LYALL. 

Doreen, 

The Story of a Singer. 

Author of " We Two," " Donovan," etc. Crown 8vo, 
buckram cloth, ornamental, 512 pages, $1.50. 
"EdnaLyall's . . . new story . . . is one of her best. 
It has, naturally, enough of tragedy to make it intensely in- 
teresting, without being sensational in any offensive sense. 
The heroine, Doreen, is a delightful character, sturdy, strong, 
lovable, womanly, and genuinely Irish. Miss Bayly is a con- 
scientious writer, imbued with deep feeling, a high purpose, 
and her style is attractive and pure." Boston Daily Adver- 
tiser. 

" Edna Lyall has evidently made a close study of the Irish 
question, and she sees its varying aspects and problems with 
a desire to do justice to all, while she stands firmly on her 
own principles. . . . There is much to recommend in Edna 
Lyall's books, and her admirers are many. The book will be 
read with interest. . . . It is yet well written and compre- 
hensive, treating of universal principles in a broad way and 
presenting characters in whom one becomes interested for 
their own sake." Literary World, Boston. 

By H. RIDER HAGGARD. 

Montezuma's Daughter. 

With 24 full-page Illustrations and Vignette by MAU- 
RICE GREIFFENHAGEN. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" Mr. Haggard has done nothing better : . . . it may well 
be doubted if he has ever done anything half so good. The 
tale is one of the good, old-fashioned sort, filled with the ele- 
ments of romance and adventure, and it moves on from one 
thrilling situation to another with a celerity and a verisimili- 
tude that positively fascinates the reader. . . . The story 
is told with astonishing variety of detail, and in its main lines 
keeps close to historical truth. The result is a really splendid 
piece of romantic literature. The illustrations, by Maurice 
Greiffenhagen, are admirable in spirit and technique." Bos- 
ton Beacon. 

By Miss LILY DOUG ALL. 

What Necessity Knows. 

A NOVEL OF CANADIAN LIFE AND CHARACTER. 
12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.00. 

"This novel is one of the three or four best novels of the 
year. The play of character and the clash of purpose are 
finely wrought out. . . . What gives the book its highest 
value is really the author's deep knowledge of motive and 
character. The reader continually comes across keen observ- 
ations and subtle expressions that not infrequently recall 
George Eliot. The novel is one that is worth reading a sec- 
ond time." Outlook, New York. 

Beggars All. 

A Novel. Sixth edition. 12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.00. 

" It is more than a story for mere summer reading, but de- 
serves a permanent place among the best works of modern 
fiction. The author has struck a vein of originality purely

J. B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY'S " 

NEW BOOKS FOR SUMMER READING. 



MY PARIS NOTE BOOK. 

By the author of " An Englishman in Paris." 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Were it possible to surpass in sensational interest the author's earlier volume, we should say that these start- 
ling revelations of the opinions, ambitions, and secrets of the Emperor Louis Napoleon have accomplished it. 
The book is compact throughout of alluring matter, and will win a world-wide audience. 



THE MYSTERY OF THE PATRICIAN 
CLUB. 

By ALBERT D. VANDAM, author of " An Englishman 

in Paris." 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" The plot is intricate, ingenious, and finely developed, the 
character analysis subtle, and the denouement dramatic." 
Boston Daily Advertiser. 



BARABBAS. 

A DREAM OF THE WORLD'S TRAGEDY. A new copyright 
novel by MARIE CORELLI, author of " Vendetti," etc. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.00. 

This remarkable novel, introducing many of the characters, inci- 
dents, and scenes in the great tragedy of the Crucifixion, is the latest 
work from the pen of a writer who has won great fame in England for 
her vivid romances upon spiritual themes. She possesses a pictur- 
esqueness of style and a grasp of character and situation of unusual 
power, and the tone of the book is in all respects deeply reverential, 
taking no liberties with the sacred text. 



AN INITIAL EXPERIENCE, and Other Stories. 

Edited by Captain CHARLES KING. 12mo, paper, 50 cts.; cloth, $1.00. 

This volume is edited by Captain King, who writes the first story, which gives its name to the book. Most 
of the others are by officers of the army, each giving a varied and peculiar flavor of adventure to the stories. 

" The author of ' The Colonel's Daughter,' ' Marion's Faith,' ' Captain Blake,' and a dozen more popular military novels, 
needs no introduction to American readers. From the lowest soldier to the highest officer, from the servant to the master, 
there is not a character in this or in any of Captain King's novels that is not wholly in keeping with expressed sentiments. 
There is not a movement made on the field, not a break from the ranks, not an offense against the military code of discipline, 
and hardly a heart-beat that escapes his watchfulness." Boston Herald. 



SOCIETY IN CHINA. 

By ROBERT K. DOUGLAS, Keeper of the Oriental Books 
and Manuscripts in the British Museum. 8vo, man- 
darin cloth extra, with 22 illustrations, $4.50. 

An account of the everyday life of the Chinese people Social, Po- 
litical, and Religious. The illustrations are in collotype from original 
drawings by Chinese artists and from photographs. 

THE TENDERNESS OF CHRIST. 

By the Rt. Rev. ANTHONY W. THOROLD, D.D, Lord 
Bishop of Winchester, author of " Questions of Faith 
and Duty." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 



THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS. 

By Mrs. FORRESTER, author of " I have Lived and 
Loved," " Diana Carew," etc. Copyrighted by the 
American publishers. 12mo, paper, 50 cents; cloth, 
$1.00. 

TRAVELS IN A TREE TOP. 

By Dr. CHARLES CONRAD ABBOTT, author of " Recent 
Rambles." Tall 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.25. 
" We are tempted to quote, but once beginning, one should not know 

when and where to stop." Boston Daily Advertiser.

Vol. 1.- THE SHEN'S PIGTAIL. ByMr.M.

Vol. I. THE UPPER BERTH. By F. MARION CRAW- 

FORD. 

" The ' Autonym ' Library opens well with Mr. Crawford's weird story 
of the ' Upper Berth,' which is no doubt one of the best ghost-stories 
we have had since the appearance of the ' Haunted and the Haunters. ' 
It is a novelty in the literature of the supernatural. Mr. Crawford treats 
his subject with a vigor and a realism that will make the flesh of the or- 
dinary ' reader ' creep, and will stir the nerves of even the most hardened 
and skeptical. If the ' Autonym ' Library keeps up to the pitch of excel- 
lence attained by this first volume, its success is assured." London 
Speaker.

thor of "Ships that Pass in the Night." American Copy- 
right Edition. 16mo, cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50 cts. 
" I have had the pleasure of reading this book, and it was a pleasure, 
I can assure you. . . . There is a sort of humor in Miss Harraden's 
stories, as if she would make her audience smile just as it was about to 
weep. Of all the women writers who have recently come to the fore 
she is the least feminine ; that is, her style is the least feminine. . . . 
The most enthusiastic admirers of ' Ships that Pass in the Night ' will 
not be disappointed in these stories, and I am inclined to think that they 
sound a much surer note than does even that remarkable story. ..." 
Jeannette L. Gilder, in the N. Y. World.

LIVING WRITERS OF FICTION. 

As the nineteenth century draws to a close, 
it still finds in the novel its favorite form of 
reading. Nearly every civilized country has, 
for the full hundred years (if not for more), 
given hearty allegiance to this literary form, 
and fashion, while dictating countless variations 
of subject-niatter and mode of treatment, has 
not ventured beyond the limits imposed by this 
form. The public libraries everywhere report 
that from sixty to eighty per cent of the books 
circulated are novels ; publishers' lists from all 



parts of the world show a large preponderance 
of works of fiction ; and the average reader, 
asking himself what books he has read during 
the past year or decade, will name half a dozen 
novels for every book of history, or collection 
of essays, or volume of poems. If ever a long- 
felt want was supplied in the history of civil- 
ization, it was when the literary instinct of 
nineteenth century writers realized the fact 
that the new age was to be, beyond any of its 
predecessors, a book-reading age, and hit upon 
the new kind of book that was to supply the 
new demand. We wonder now what our an- 
cestors ever did without novels (for, from the 
height of superior opportunities, we cannot give 
the name of novel to the sort of thing whereof 
Dunlop was the chronicler), and we read with 
mingled pity and amazement of the way in 
which they devoured solemn tomes of ancient 
history, or pastoral conceits expressed in arti- 
ficial verse, or the chit-chat of the eighteenth 
century essayist. When we think of the read- 
ers of " Clelie " or of " Clarissa," the situation 
becomes pathetic, for those eager souls were, 
in their dull way, groping towards the light ; 
dim and tantalizing visions of the possibilities 
of romance must have been vouchsafed them ; 
yet no nearer than such Pisgah-summit (their 
Pisgah but a sort of foothill) were they ever 
to approach the promised land. 

That fiction has been the characteristic liter- 
ary form of the nineteenth century is indisput- 
able. That it will occupy a similar position 
in the twentieth century it would, perhaps, be 
rash to conclude. Yet the chances of its so 
doing are considerable ; the impulse is by no 
means spent or even waning ; and it would be 
still more rash to make any equally specific 
alternative statement. Just now we have no 
intention of predicting anything, but rather of 
making the briefest possible survey of the art 
of fiction in its present state, or rather the most 
summary sort of catalogue of those chiefly em- 
inent in its practice. Ignoring all ephemeral 
successes and merely local celebrities, we ask 
the question : What men and women now liv- 
ing have produced works of fiction of anything 
like enduring value, works that appeal to a 
more lasting constituency than that of the hour, 
to a wider audience than that offered by the 
immediate environment of their authors ?

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Of the three or four great novelists that Rus- 
sia has produced, Count Tolstoi alone is left, 
and from him there is little reason to expect 
any further work comparable with " War and 
Peace," " Anna Karenina," or even with " The 
Cossacks." The writer of almost first-rate fic- 
tion has become a producer of third-rate tracts, 
and literature mourns the defection. But the 
great Slavonic North has sent us of recent years, 
in the person of Henry k Sienkiewicz, the Pol- 
ish novelist, a writer of fiction quite the equal 
of the Russian soldier turned pietist. His mag- 
nificent romantic trilogy devoted to the seven- 
teenth - century wars of the Polish Common- 
wealth, and his subtle piece of psychological 
analysis called " Without Dogma," are mas- 
terpieces in their respective kinds, and with 
them Polish literature renews the appeal to 
European attention first made by Mickiewicz 
half a century ago. The one notable name of 
literary Hungary at the present day is that of 
the veteran Maurus Jokai, who has written in- 
numerable novels, and whom his countrymen 
have recently taken much delight in honoring. 

The step from Hungary to Austria is easy, 
politically if not ethnically, but no Austrian 
novelist seems greatly worthy of mention. Prob- 
ably the most important names are those of 
Herr Karl Emil Franzos, whose "Ein Kampf 
urn's Recht " is certainly a great novel, and the 
Ritter von Sacher-Masoch, whose reported dis- 
patch to a better world we recently joined the 
American press in chronicling, but who, we are 
now happy to say from later accounts, is still 
among the living. In Germany, both Herr 
Spielhagen and Herr Freytag are still at work, 
although the former is producing poor novels 
and the latter none at all. But the author of 
" Problematische Naturen " and "Hammer und 
Amboss " is one of the great names of German 
nineteenth-century literature, and the author 
of " Soil und Haben " and " Die Verlorene 
Handschrift " is even more assuredly another. 
Herr Heyse, also, who has written two of the 
best German novels in existence, remains in 
the ranks, and may yet give the world a worthy 
successor to "Kinder der Welt" and " Im Para- 
diese." The conspicuous group of German nov- 
elists who have dealt with the romance of an- 
cient history should in the present connection 
at least be represented by Herr Felix Dahn's 
" Ein Kampf um Rom," and possibly also by 
one or two of the better among the many ro- 
mantic fictions of Dr. Ebers. 

In the Scandinavian countries, the first 
place among writers of fiction must be given 



to Herr Bjornson. As a writer of peasant 
idylls " Arne,""Synnove Solbakken " and the 
like he first became known to the world out- 
side of Norway ; as the author of the two ambi- 
tious books of his later years "Det Flager i 
Byen og paa Havuen " and " Paa Guds Veje " 
he has greatly extended and strengthened 
his already wide reputation. We will say, par- 
enthetically, that these books are to be had in 
English translations, respectively entitled " The 
Heritage of the Kurts " and " In God's Way." 
Before turning from the North of Europe to 
the South, a word may be given to the new 
blood infused into the life of Dutch literature 
by the somewhat morbid sensitivists, of whom 
Heer Louis Couperus is the most conspicuous, 
and another word this time of unqualified 
praise to the Dutchman who calls himself 
" Maarten Maartens," who has contracted the 
singular habit of writing his novels in the En- 
glish language, and whom we should insist upon 
claiming as an ornament of our own fiction were 
not his themes so unmistakably Dutch. 

It is a little curious that Italy, from whom 
we have reason to expect much, should have no 
contemporary writer of fiction deserving of 
mention here ; should have produced, indeed, 
but one great novel in the course of the cen- 
tury. One need only evoke the recollection of 
" I Promessi Sposi " to realize how compara- 
tively insignificant is the best that is offered 
by any Italian novelist now living. On the 
other hand, Spain, towards whom we had lit- 
tle reason to look for literary activity, has 
shown a promising development during the 
past few years, and has produced, in Senores 
Valera, V aides, and Galdos, a group of nov- 
elists of whom any country might be proud. 

When we turn to France, we- find an em- 
barras de richesse indeed, for France and En- 
gland have throughout the century shared the 
highest honors in the art of fiction. While 
other countries have produced great novelists 
now and then, these two have been well sup- 
plied nearly all the time. At present, although 
France can boast no Balzac, no " Stendhal," 
no Flaubert, no Dumas pere, and no Hugo, she 
still boasts the creative genius that gave us the 
immortal Tartarin and the immense vitality 
and force that have produced the Rougon- 
Macquart series, the grace and humor of the 
author of " L'Abbe Constantin," and the sub- 
tle psychology displayed in " Cosinopolis," by 
the newest of the Academicians. And besides 
MM. Daudet and Zola, Halevy and Bourget, 
there are the names of M. Feuillet, M. Cher-

buliez, M. Anatole France, M. Edouard Rod, 
and so many others that we hardly know where 
to stop in the enumeration. 

Coming at last to the literature of our own 
language, we find, upon the other side of the 
Atlantic, that three novelists emerge very dis- 
tinctly from the group of the older men 
Messrs. Blackmore, Black, and Hardy. They 
have all been prolific, and the best work of 
each is very good work indeed. Yet no one 
can fairly claim for " Lorna Doone " and " The 
Maid of Sker," for " A Daughter of Heth " 
and " Sunrise," or for " The Return of the Na- 
tive " and " Tess of the D'Urbervilles," that 
they are seriously comparable with the best 
works of Scott, or Thackeray, or even Dickens. 
Nor is it possible to admit that Mrs. Humphry 
Ward has yet shown herself to be a novelist of 
the rank of George Eliot or Charlotte Bronte. 
She, as well as the three men whom we have 
mentioned, must perforce be content to know 
that their rank is the first only because their 
age is degenerate. Among the older men we 
must also mention Mr. Shorthouse, although 
it seems likely that he will be remembered as 
the man of one book, just as Blanco White is 
remembered as the man of one sonnet. But 
" John Inglesant " is one of the noteworthy 
books of the generation, and will not soon be 
forgotten. Mr. George Meredith, too, must 
be reckoned with the older men, although his 
reputation (in any broad sense) is young. 
Whether the unwieldy craft that he has set 
afloat will escape shipwreck or not is a prob- 
lem we confess our inability to solve. Among 
the younger men we have, of course, the eccen- 
tric and unclassifiable Mr. Kipling, and such 
restorers of the good old fashion of historical 
romance as Mr. Stanley Weyman and Dr. 
Conan Doyle. We also have Mr. Robert Louis 
Stevenson, who has style and invention so hap- 
pily commingled that he is likely to please at 
least one more generation than his own. 

In our own country, the art of fiction may 
be said to hold its own, a phrase which means 
far less than it would in France or England. 
Hawthorne is the only really great artist we 
have ever had, and his genius, exquisite as it 
was, had such close limitations that he by no 
means answers to the long-felt need for a Great 
American Novelist. Nor does this much-in- 
voked abstraction show any signs of taking ma- 
terial shape. For neither Mr. Henry James nor 
Mr. Howells nor the prolific and entertaining 
Mr. Crawford may the title be claimed. We 
are sometimes inclined to think that Mr. Bret 



Harte comes nearer than any other to achiev- 
ing the distinction. But the place of honor 
among our living novelists should probably be 
given to Dr. Holmes, although " Elsie Venner " 
and " The Guardian Angel " lie so far back of 
the present as to seem to belong to another 
age. What other living American has given 
us two novels (or even one) of such enduring 
interest and vitality ? 



WILLIAM D WIGHT WHITNEY. 

In the death of William Dwight Whitney, which 
occurred at New Haven June 7, is fallen the prince 
of American scholars. Others of our countrymen 
have been and are highly honored for their achieve- 
ments in learning, but none has so united in him- 
self breadth and accuracy, the power to produce 
and stimulate, simplicity and singleness of purpose. 
Scholarship was to him more than an accomplish- 
ment, it was a lofty mission pursued with all the 
force of an intense moral earnestness. Like Lowell's 
dominating trait of patriotism, which rose to the 
degree of a passion, was the jealous devotion of 
Whitney to the service and honor of his profession. 
It was this which at times caused him (as was also 
true of our urbane and gentle-spirited poet) to twist 

his ... , , 

gilt of words 

Into a scourge of rough and knotted cords, 
Unmusical, that whistle as they swing," 

and it is in this depth of devotion to his high calling 
that we must find the motive for the trenchant vigor 
of his polemic, and not in any odium scholasticum 
or American assertiveness. To a man of his ideals, 
the currency of scholarship was debased by looseness 
of method or inaccuracy of statement, embellished 
though it might be by whatever daintiness of con- 
ceit, or however much it might presume upon unques- 
tioning popular acquiescence. 

He was born in 1827 in Northampton, Massa- 
chusetts, in a region which has perhaps contributed 
to this country a larger share of intellectual ability 
than any other of its* size. After graduating at 
Williams College, he was for three years a clerk in 
a Northampton bank, and while thus engaged he 
spent his spare hours in the study of languages, 
especially Sanskrit. It is not unreasonable to attri- 
bute to his acquaintance with the world of practical 
affairs some of the wholesome breadth and calmness 
of his judgment in other fields. He was in many 
ways a man of wide sympathies. He shared with 
his distinguished brother a strong taste for the nat- 
ural sciences, being for many years a member of 
the American Association (attending its meeting in 
Chicago in 1868), and finding a diverting avocation 
in collecting minerals and mounting birds. He pur- 
sued graduate studies for one year at Yale, then 
studied Sanskrit and comparative philology in Ger- 
many under Bopp, Weber, and Rudolph Roth. His 



354 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



wide reputation dates from the edition of the stand- 
ard text of the Atharva Veda, prepared by Roth 
and himself, based upon the manuscripts, and in 
every way an admirably solid performance. In 
1854 he wa's made Professor of Sanskrit at Yale, 
with the additional chair of Comparative Philology 
in 1870. His lectures on " Language and the Sci- 
ence of Language," originally given before the 
popular audiences of the Smithsonian and Lowell 
Institutes, were published in 1867, and at once at- 
tracted the attention of the learned world, remain- 
ing to the present time an authoritative statement 
of the mission and methods of philological research. 
Somewhat discursive in treatment, they are supple- 
mented by his later essays, particularly his chapter 
on the Science of Language in the article " Philol- 
ogy " in the ninth edition of the " Encyclopaedia 
Britannica," which is of particular interest for its 
putting of his standpoint regarding the ultimate be- 
ginnings of human speech, which, according to Whit- 
ney, have their origin in man's practical necessity 
for a means of communication, and not in any nat- 
ural existence of names corresponding to certain 
conceptions. Any attempt to determine how and 
when this communication first broke forth must re- 
main futile. The prevailing use of the voice for 
this purpose is a survival according to natural fit- 
ness. The first signs were doubtless imitative, 
whether of sounds heard in external nature or of 
the natural emotional outcries of primitive man, and 
such a language-stock as these elements would sup- 
ply is quite sufficient for the development of actual 
human speech. While in Germany in 1867 he was 
asked by the firm of Breitkopf & Hartel to prepare 
a Sanskrit grammar for their proposed Indo-Euro- 
pean series. He accepted the commission, and ap- 
proached the subject for the first time in a manner 
corresponding to enlightened philological demands. 
The characteristic features of this work were its 
being an attempt to make a scientific grammar 
based upon the actual facts of the language, rather 
than on the inherited traditions of native schools, 
in its giving a full consideration of the Vedic dia- 
lect, and in treating the language throughout as ac- 
cented. It is no exaggeratioij to say that up to the 
present time no attempt has been made to improve 
upon this splendid monument of learning, and that 
wherever philology is studied the Sanskrit grammar 
of Whitney is a unique and indispensable adjunct. 
His complete edition of the Taittiriya Praticakhya 
(1871) obtained the Bopp Prize from the Berlin 
Academy as being the most important publication 
in Sanskrit during the preceding three years. His 
predominant influence in the American Oriental So- 
ciety, of which he was president after 1884, and to 
the publications of which he contributed a large 
share, remained potent and inspiring long after his 
impaired health forbade his attendance upon meet- 
ings. His last great service of superintending the 
publication of " The Century Dictionary " was 
brought to a successful close. That work, whose 
projection was looked upon somewhat jealously as 



a sort of premature intrusion upon the field planned 
by the English Philological Society, has trium- 
phantly vindicated its raison d'etre, and is one of 
the cherished possessions of the English-speaking 
world. He took an appreciative interest in the 
World's Congress of Philology held in Chicago last 
year, approved of its plans, and aided in them by 
explicit suggestion of themes for discussion. 

I have a vivid memory of my first meeting with 
this venerated scholar when, years ago. I made a 
pilgrimage to New Haven to consult with him 
about my own plans. He received me in his beau- 
tiful home, filled with all the symbols of a broad 
and refined culture, with a dignified but simple and 
considerate manner that was most reassuring. In 
fact, nothing was more characteristic of this great 
man (who was sometimes represented abroad as a 
wai'ning example of overbearing self-conceit) than 
the cordial and unpretentious encouragement he 
gave beginners in their early endeavors, and the 
courteous respect with which he entertained their 
productions, immature and blundering as these often 
were. In looking on his genial, ruddy face, crowned 
with its silvery hair, I felt, as perhaps never else- 
where in the same degree, that homage which man- 
kind pays to the eminent scholar, as one of the 
highest products of civilization and human culture. 
I have never wondered that a certain professor in 
the University of Berlin was wont to allude to him 
as " die Zierde der Wissenschaft." 

JAMES TAFT HATFIELD. 



THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE NOVEL. 

When a certain division of literature is, for his- 
torical reasons, dominant in current literary produc- 
tion, it is like a drag-net which ensnares divers sorts 
of fish. It attracts not only the natural makers in 
that form, but others whose gifts fit them better for 
some other work but who cannot resist the centrip- 
etal pull of this most popular activity. Thus, in 
the Elizabethan days the drama was the type of liter- 
ature which represented the age, most interested the 
public, and consequently engaged the main attention 
of the begetters of literary masterpieces. And hence 
it is that we meet with men like Peele, Greene, and 
Lodge, and later, Cartwright and Shirley, whose call 
to play-making was not imperative, whose work was 
more or less imitative. Had the mode of the day 
in letters demanded the essay or the novel, they 
would as readily have turned in those directions. 
Peele was naturally a superior controversialist, Lodge 
could write so exquisite a prose pastoral as " Ros- 
alind " whence Shakespeare drew his lovely " As 
You Like It," and Shirley had powers as a lyrist 
exampled in so dainty a song as that entitled " A 
Lullaby." 

At present the novel is the all-engulfing literary 
form. Alphonse Daudet has asked of late : " What 
shall be the novel, the literature, of the future ? "

as if the two terms were coterminous and inter- 
changeable. Fiction has made sad inroads upon the 
ancient and honorable champaign of Poetry ; the 
essay is as naught to it in popularity and applause ; 
while even the stern historian tries to give his chron- 
icle of the past, of " old, unhappy far-off things," 
a narrative interest, and some boldly throw their 
history into the guise of an historical romance, albeit 
their purpose is not artistic but didactic the im- 
parting of knowledge rather than the giving of 
pleasure. Fiction, in short, is the modern magnet 
toward which all literary product and power is drawn. 
That this predominance is in some ways an evil 
(despite the indisputable virtues of the novel), that 
it is possibly fraught with danger to general literary 
poduction, is a thesis which will at least bear further 
amplification. 

The injury done to poetry has been alluded to. 
When Walter Scott, after triumphing in narrative 
and ballad verse, took up the writing of romances 
and charmed all Europe, he gave English fiction an 
importance and dignity hardly enjoyed by it before. 
Without overlooking Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's 
testimony that Richardson's " Pamela " wrung tears 
from the chambermaids of all nations, it is pretty 
safe to say that with the Waverley Novels our fiction, 
as a distinct form, gained a prestige which, in spite 
of fluctuations and what at present some incline to 
call a woeful devolution, it has never lost. And 
verse has suffered a proportionate decay of author- 
ity. It has come to pass that verse-men adopt a 
semi-apologetic tone in putting forth their wares, 
and the soi-disant scientific spirit of the age tends 
to look askance at such activity. To be sure, this 
indifference to poetry may easily be exaggerated. 
If the critic go back to any earlier period of En- 
glish poetry, much the same influences may be de- 
tected : the poets themselves timid and knee-supple ; 
their carping judges aghast at the dearth of good 
work, and with their mouths full of praise of some 
previous day. Walter Scott's accent in speaking 
of "The Lady of the Lake," before its publica- 
tion, has, for us, a curiously tentative and depre- 
catory sound. And to read to-day such a critique 
as Peacock's "Four Ages. of Poetry," wherein not 
Scott alone, but Lord Byron, Wordsworth, Cole- 
ridge, and Southey are dismissed with contemptuous 
paragraphs, is sufficiently amusing, while suggest- 
ive of the irresistible tendency to belittle the fore- 
ground in favor of the historical perspective a 
strange reversal of the ordinary laws of composi- 
tion. But aside from all this, it is true enough that 
contemporaneous poetry is, speaking broadly, toler- 
ated rather than appraised ; if the text of sales be 
applied, the comparatively small editions of verse 
the regular edition being 500 volumes, and limited 
editions of less size being a fad of the time show 
the same thing, from the publisher's garish point of 
view. Look, too, at the relative value set on fiction 
and verse in the magazines, those faithful registers 
of popular taste. The story is the sine qud non, 
the one literary form which must be supplied ; the 



quatrain or sonnet is tucked in to fill unseemly gaps 
between articles. Its function is that of a tail-piece. 
In the days of Good Queen Bess, poetry in play- 
form was the acceptable mode of literary expression: 
there was then a happy conjunction of public de- 
mand and artistic supply, though whether they stood 
in the relation of cause and effect is matter for par- 
ley. But so much may be roundly affirmed : what 
the play was to that time, the novel is to this. 
Those now writing verse must expect and be con- 
tent with smaller sales, slower reputation, and, in a 
sense, an uncongenial environment. As a result, 
the fictional maelstrom sucks in some who in an- 
other day would have been poets, or who, having 
the name of poets, would have done greater work in 
verse than will ever come from them under exist- 
ing conditions. It is a curious query, What might 
Kipling have achieved in poetry in an age which 
made the poetic drama the recognized mode of ex- 
pression ? This, with two or three of his fine bal- 
lads in mind, to say nothing of the dramatic in- 
stinct in his fiction, is not so superficial a suggestion 
as might at first appear. But born into these lat- 
ter-day conditions, he is an Uhlan of story-telling, 
who only now and then makes a side-charge into the 
placid domains of Poesy. 

Fiction, again, draws the natural essayist away 
from his metier. Those heretical enough to pre- 
fer the essay-work of Henry James to his novels 
will think of him in this connection; a humorist 
like Mark Twain, undoubtedly a teller of tales, but 
hardly a novelist in the full modern content of the 
word, is another exemplar. The cult of the analytic 
in fiction has led many writers, whose forte lay in 
such effects rather than in synthetic creation, into 
novel-making ; and, conversely, perhaps the analytic 
tendency has been thus exaggerated until it has cul- 
minated in The Story-That-Never-Ends. Interesting 
questions and cross-questions arise here. But the 
main contention, that this modern maelstrom, with 
its secret undertow, has drawn the essayists into its 
potent circle, to the impoverishment of the essay 
delightsome form made luminous by the names of 
Montaigne, Lamb, Heine, and Arnold and, as well, 
to the dubious improvement of Fiction itself, is for 
easy apprehension. Recently, and in large part 
due to the brilliant critical papers of such English 
and American writers as Pater, Stevenson, Moore, 
Lang, and Repplier, a reaction in favor of the es- 
say is observable, and it may be this will grow into 
a veritable renaissance. So far, however, it is lit- 
tle more than a beginning ; that the reading of the 
older and standard essayists has been checked by 
the novel and its half-breed ally, the newspaper, 
cannot be gainsaid. 

But regarding Fiction alone, what are the effects 
of this autocracy which it maintains in the world 
of literature ? To our thinking, we get bad novels, 
and too many of them, because of it. The form has 
so supreme a power, and the emoluments are so glit- 
tering, that those who have it in them to do good 
work lash themselves to unnatural exertions in or-

der to answer the demand, and sell their second- 
best in lieu of their best, which takes more time. 
Very few of our modern novel-writers exhibit the 
conscientious care and leisurely method of Mrs. Ward 
or Mr. Stevenson. The temptation is great, and the 
danger extreme. And far worse than this, a horde 
of hangers-on rush into the field and by their an- 
tics, utterly lacking coherence, with no raison d'etre 
to justify their presence, bring what is a gift, an 
art, and a consecrated labor into misunderstanding 
and disrepute. It is fast coming to the point where 
a man who has not written a novel gains thereby 
a certain distinction : and this surely is ominous for 
the highest interests of Fiction. But it is ques- 
tionable if the novel will remain indefinitely the 
dominant type, the maelstrom engulfing the various 
kinds of literary power and activity. All analogy 
points the other way, begetting a presumption in 
favor of some new form, or the revival of an old. 
It is not impossible that with a new impulse in poe- 
try of the narrative or dramatic order, Fiction will 
find its elder sister occupying her sometime place 
as a coequal. Indeed, the forecast for the drama, 
uniting as it does the most splendid creative liter- 
ary energy with action of the most direct and uni- 
versally appealing kind, is especially bright. And 
the literary movement in this direction of late sug- 
gests an ultimate shifting in the relative importance 
of those forms of literary expression which in our 
day engage the interest and affection of men.

ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF CHICAGO* 

All persons who believe that literature is at once the 
greatest of the fine arts and the one most available for 
general study must be interested in the reports that THE 
DIAL has published concerning the work in English at 
various American colleges and universities. 

The English department is the largest one in the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, and very generous provision has been 
made for it. During the three calendar quarters from 
October 1, 1893, to June 30, 1894, twelve instructors 
have given forty-eight courses of instruction in English. 
Three of these have been in required theme- writing; the 
remaining forty-five courses have each called for four 
or five hours of class-room work a week for twelve 
weeks, except that a few Seminar classes have met only 

*This article is the ninth of an extended series on the 
Teaching of English at American Colleges and Universities, 
of which the following have already appeared in THE DIAL : 
English at Yale University, by Professor Albert S. Cook 
(Feb. 1); English at Columbia College, by Professor Bran- 
der Matthews (Feb. 16) ; English at Harvard University, by 
Professor Barrett Wendell (March 1) ; English at Stanford 
University, by Professor Melville B. Anderson ( March 16); 
English at Cornell University, by Professor Hiram Corson 
( April 1) ; English at the University of Virginia, by Professor 
Charles W. Kent (April 16) ; English at the University of 
Illinois, by Professor D. K. Dodge (May 1) ; English at La-

at the State University of Iowa, by Prof. E. E. Hale, Jr.

two hours a week. During this time, 849 students, 
counting by class registration, have taken regular courses 
in English; and 204 more have taken required theme- 
writing. The number of different persons taking these 
courses has been 425, not including any who take only 
required theme-writing. 

The following persons will give instruction in English 
at this University during the year extending from July 
1, 1894, to June 30, 1895: Professor W. C. Wilkinson, 
D.D. ; University Extension Professor R. G. Moulton, 
Ph.D.; Professor L. A. Sherman, Ph.D., of the Univer- 
sity of Nebraska (at the University of Chicago only for 
the Summer Quarter of '94) ; University Extension As- 
sociate Professor N. Butler, A.M. ; Associate Professor 
W. D. McClintock, A.M.; Assistant Professor F. A. 
Blackburn, Ph.D.; Assistant Professor M. F. Crow,, 
Ph.D.; Assistant Professor A. H. Tolman, Ph.D.; In- 
structor R. W. Herrick, A.B.; Instructor R. M. Lovett, 
A.B.; Tutor E. H. Lewis, Ph.D.; Assistant Myra Rey- 
nolds, A.M.; Docent O. L. Triggs, A.B.; Honorary Fel- 
low F. I. Carpenter, A.B., Honorary Fellow H. C. Brain- 
ard, Ph.B. (Total, fifteen.) All of these except Pro- 
fessor Sherman, Miss Reynolds, and Miss Brainard 
have been teaching here during the past year. Ten of 
those in the above list will give their entire time to the- 
work of instruction; five give a part of their time. 

One course in English literature, and only one, is re- 
quired of all the students. This must be taken during 
the first year of undergraduate work. It seems desira- 
ble that the pupil be introduced promptly to the treas- 
ures of his own literature ; it is well that he should learn 
early that the condensed milk of text-books cannot 
suffice for his mental nutriment, that all the fact-books- 
and reasoning books, taken together, cannot accomplish 
his intellectual salvation, cannot give him a liberal ed- 
ucation. This required course is an introduction to the 
study of literature. It gives a brief outline of the his- 
tory of English literature, together with studies in the 
chief literary forms the drama, narrative poetry, lyric 
poetry, the novel, the essay. It may seem to some that 
more than one quarter should be given to this work, but 
it is the policy of the University to have as few required 
courses as practicable. Some election is allowed dur- 
ing the second year of college work; after the second 
year there are at present no required courses whatever. 

Of the elective courses in English literature, each 
calls for four or five hours of class-room work a week 
for an entire quarter; except that some of the Seminar 
classes meet only two hours per week. The courses are 
arranged chronologically, those that are more general 
coming at the end. Many important authors and sub- 
jects are necessarily omitted from the work of any single 
year. A condensed list of these elective courses for 
the coming year is as follows: Old English Literature 
(Blackburn); Middle English Readings (Blackburn);. 
The Works of Chaucer (Tolman); The Rise of the En- 
glish Drama and Its History to 1560 (Tolman) ; The 
History of the Drama in England from 1560 to 1642 
(Crow); Elizabethan Prose (Crow); Elizabethan Sem- 
inar (Autumn, Winter, and Spring Quarters, Crow); 
The Sources of Shakespeare's Plays (Crow) ; Shake- 
speare Seminar, those, plays in the First Folio which 
have been thought to be of composite authorship, etc. 
(Tolman) ; The Interpretation of Representative Play& 
of Shakespeare (McClintock) ; Studies in the Interpre- 
tation of Shakespeare (Sherman); Critical Examination 
of the Text of Hamlet (Brainard); Elizabethan Poetry 
(Carpenter) ; The Poetry of Spenser (Carpenter) ; Spen-

mer and Spring Quarters, McClintock) ; The Elements 
of Literature (Summer and Spring Quarters, McClin- 
tock) ; Theory and Practice of Literary Interpretation 
(Moulton). 

The University Extension work in English literature 
falls especially to Professors Moulton and Butler. Since 
October 1, 1893, Associate Professor Butler has served 
most successfully as Director of the University Exten- 
sion Department, and has given sixty Extension lectures. 
Since January 1, 1894, Professor Moulton has conducted 
two courses of regular class work at the University, and 
lias delivered ninety-six Extension lectures. No other 
American institution does so much in this line of work 
as the University of Chicago. Many courses of lec- 
ture-studies in English literature are offered for the 
coming year. It is not the policy of the University to 
encourage Extension lecturing on the part of the regu- 
lar class-room force, though such courses are given un- 
der special circumstances. 

The masterpieces of our literature are studied at the 
University of Chicago primarily as works of literary 
art. If one says that " English should be studied as 
Greek is," then it must be asked, How should Greek be 
studied ? To investigate every possible question that 
can be raised in connection with a piece of literature is 
to be thorough indeed; but is it not possible, in being 
thorough, to be thoroughly wrong ? An artistic whole, 
like a vital one, is something indefinitely greater than 
the sum of its parts. We should not fail in artistic 
study to make the whole the centre of interest. The 
study of the most charming of the English classics has 
too often been made a mere starting-point for laborious 
investigations into antiquities, history, geography, ety- 
mology, phonetics, the history of the English language, 
and general linguistics. The stones of learning have 
been doled out to students hungry for the bread of lit- 
erature. Literary masterpieces should be studied chiefly, 
it seems to me, for their beauty. It is because of their 
charm, their beauty, that they have immortality; it is 
only because of this that we study them at all. If the 
student is not helped to enter into their beauty and to 
love them for it, the teaching would seem to be wrong 
somewhere. No study can be too minute and careful 
which aids one in gaining a vital appreciation of a great 
masterpiece. An unfailing source of rest and refresh- 
ment, a life-long process of self-education, great ideals 
of life and character, to all of these the student should 
gain access through the study of English literature. 

For the most part the literary and linguistic lines of 
study are kept apart at this University ; but not entirely. 
Linguistic questions are sometimes vital to the interpre- 
tation of a passage; for example, the word " weird " in 
the phrase " the weird sisters " in " Macbeth " calls for 
explanation, and will repay the most careful study. 
Even in a literary study of Chaucer it is necessary to 
pay careful attention to his language. I must not be 



understood as objecting to the most thorough study of 
the English language. It is a fair question whether a 
certain amount of such study should not be required of 
^ all college students. According to a great law of edu- 
cation, " the law of the nearest," the history of the En- 
glish tongue is the most fitting and helpful introduction 
to the general study of the life and growth of language. 
Only in the mother-tongue does the student have access 
to the actual phenomena of speech. Here one boun- 
dary of linguistic investigation the terminus ad quern 
is the present form of the language; and this meets his 
ear at every turn. The present life and growth of one's 
native tongue can be studied at first hand, and is the 
great source of light for the study of language-change 
in the past. Few recent movements in education have 
been more marked than the increased attention given 
to the historical study of English. 

In addition to the two literary courses already men- 
tioned, Assistant Professor Blackburn offers nine courses 
in Old English, the History of the English Language, 
etc., for the year beginning July 1, 1894. 

Every student is required to take a course in rhetoric 
and English composition at the beginning of his under- 
graduate work. Theme-writing is required throughout 
the first two years. The instructors in rhetoric expect 
the students to find the subjects for their themes, or com- 
positions, in the various other departments where their 
studies lie. The principles and rules of rhetoric, they 
hold, help a man to treat a subject appropriately; but 
he must find some subject himself, or one must be found 
for him. A list of topics, together with helpful refer- 
ences, is furnished to the classes. These topics are rec- 
ommended by the instructors in the various departments 
in which the students are working, and usually have some 
vital connection with the subjects that are discussed in the 
class-room. Fourteen elective courses in rhetorical study 
are offered for the coming year by Messrs. Wilkinson, 
Herrick, Lovett, and Lewis. 

Every college graduate should be able to prove that 
he is liberally educated by the grace and skill with 
which he expresses his thoughts. Much practice in writ- 
ing is required of every student who takes his college 
course in the University of Chicago. I trust that it is 
only because of the youthfulness of our institution that 
active literary societies do not yet exist among our stu- 
dents. This should be remedied, since the voluntary 
rhetorical practice obtained in organizations of this kind 
is most helpful. The University of Chicago has fifteen 
departmental clubs; these are united in an organization 
called The University Union. Original papers are read 
before the English Club by instructors, students, and 
invited guests. Three clubs are appointed each quarter 
to present papers at a public meeting of the University 
Union. A prize of fifty dollars goes to the student chosen 
by competition to represent each club. 

Two so-called " senior " fellowships, or four " junior " 
fellowships, are assigned to the department of English. 
These are granted to college graduates of exceptional 
ability who plan to do advanced work in English. Ow- 
ing to the large number of applicants, four " junior " 
fellowships have been awarded for the coming year. 
Each of these gives to the holder exemption from the 
payment of tuition and $320 in cash. Two other fel- 
lowships for this department have been provided for 
this year by private generosity.

IjORD WOLSELEY'S MARLBOROUGH. * 

The prize of .500 offered by the Duchess 
of Maryborough for the best poem commem- 
orating her husband's deeds was won by the 
writer of the following stanza : 

" Five hundred pounds, too small a boon 
To set the poet's Muse in tune 

That nothing might escape her. 

Were I to attempt the heroic story 

Of the illustrious Churchill's glory, 

It scarce would buy the paper." 

Since this thrifty bard pocketed the Duchess's 
guineas the hero of Blenheim has had, as a rule, 
less flattering critics. Detraction, as well as 
death, " loves a shining mark "; and the shafts 
of satire and invective, winged and envenomed 
by party hate and sped by strong and sure 
hands, have pierced to the quick " great Marl- 
bro's " renown. Whatever may have been the 
motives that ruled his conduct, England owes 
much to Marlborough ; and it is high time that 
his career should be fully reviewed and his 
genius and services shown in the same clear 
light that has been shed upon his faults. 

Partisans of the Duke, if any there be, will 
find little to cavil at on the score of scant ap- 
preciation in the work of his latest biographer, 
Lord Wolseley. The two beautiful volumes 
before us, forming the first instalment of his 
book, reach only to the death of William III., 
to the threshold, that is, of Marlborough's real 
life-work. Leaving thus untouched his crown- 
ing years, during a part of which he virtually 
ruled England and fairly outshone in the field 
the " Sun King " himself, they cover the period 
of the gravest of the charges against him ; and 
to this fact we may primarily ascribe their 
pretty constant, and we think unfortunate, 
strain of advocacy. A pleasant narrator and 
a clear and cogent military critic, Lord Wolse- 
ley, despite his truth of statement and his 
occasional censures, plainly holds a brief for 
his hero ; and he proceeds throughout to deny 
or to palliate his alleged shortcomings, from 
leze-majesty to bad spelling, with a zeal the 
momentum of which lands him in the amazing 
conclusion that the Duke of Marlborough was 
not only a great captain, but in some sort a 
moral hero as well. " In moral character," he 
tells us, " Marlborough was as far above the

BOUGH ; to the Accession of Queen Anne. By General Vis- 
count Wolseley, K.P. In two volumes, illustrated. New 
York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



age in which he lived as he was in ability above 
the men who governed it." We may say at 
once that Lord Wolseley is too good a soldier 
to be a good casuist ; and his honesty, more- 
over, being at odds with his logic, he usually 
starts out by stating the case against his client 
so fairly as to hopelessly weaken his subse- 
quent rebuttal. At some points, certainly, the 
student of Swift and Macaulay will find reason 
to modify his views ; but even on Lord Wolse- 
ley's own showing we think the final judg- 
ment on Marlborough must still be that, in the 
words of the moderate Green, "Of honor or 
the finer sentiments of mankind he knew noth- 
ing." 

A notable, and not, we think, a very happy 
attempt at whitewashing is our author's chap- 
ter on the Brest affair "the basest," says 
Macaulay, " of all the hundred villainies of 
Marlborough." It may be remembered that 
in 1694 William III. planned a naval and mil- 
itary expedition against Brest, which had been 
left temporarily defenseless by the departure 
of Tourville's squadron. The town was to be 
surprised, and secresy as to the destination of 
the expedition was of the first moment. The 
matter leaking out, William's plan was treach- 
erously disclosed to Louis in time to enable 
him to put Brest in a state of defense, and sub- 
sequently to entrap the English and defeat 
them with great slaughter. Four hundred sea- 
men and seven hundred soldiers were mowed 
down by the fire from Vauban's skilfully- 
placed batteries, and Talmash, the English 
commander and Marlborough's military rival, 
received his death-wound. Talmash died, it 
is said, protesting that he had been lured into 
a snare by treachery which was afterwards 
proved to be the case. A century later a copy 
or translation of a letter from Marlborough to 
James II. giving full information of the pro- 
jected attack on Brest was found in the Scotch 
College at Paris ; and he has since been pretty 
generally held responsible for the disaster and 
the slaughter of his countrymen. At the time 
of writing he was in disfavor at court ; and 
his object, aside from a wish to ingratiate him- 
self with James, with whom he had been for 
some time coquetting, is held to have been to 
ruin Talmash and to force himself on Will- 
iam as the only Englishman fit for a high mil- 
itary post. Lord Wolseley admits that Marl- 
borough wrote the infamous letter to James r 
but he denies that he was thejirst informant. 
His defense is that when the Duke wrote he did 
so knowing that William's plan had already

THE DIAL 



been betrayed to St. Germains ; and that there- 
fore the French preparations which led to the 
English defeat were not due to his specific act 
of writing. " If," says Lord Wolseley, " it be 
conclusively proved that the preparations were 
the result of information obtained by Louis 
from others previous to the date of Marlbo- 
rough's letter, then this charge falls to the 
ground." Granting the facts to be as Lord 
Wolseley states them, his defense if indeed he 
means it as such seems little better than a 
quibble. For in knowingly allowing the Brest 
expedition to sail to certain failure and possi- 
ble destruction Marlborough certainly became 
particeps criminis in the original betrayal ; and 
his meanly writing to James, with a flourish of 
doing him a service which he knew was no ser- 
vice, is only a further proof that he was, as his 
foes assert, a virtuoso in duplicity a man at 
all points " for close designs and crooked coun- 
cils fit." It should be added that our author 
by no means acquits Marlborough of gross mis- 
conduct in the Brest matter. " It cannot be 
forgotten," he says, " that the great man for 
whom England built Blenheim palace did in- 
trigue with his country's enemies." 

Churchill's course in the Revolution of 1688 
is more easily defended. There are junctures 
at which treason becomes, as Rousseau said of 
insurrection, " a public duty "; and the land- 
ing of William of Orange at Torbay assuredly 
marked one of them. Protestant Englishmen 
were by that event called upon to choose be- 
tween disloyalty to a dangerous tyrant who had 
repeatedly broken his Coronation oath, and 
disloyalty to the nation ; and the choice lying 
between a peccadillo and a crime, most men 
chose the former. A lingering superstition as 
to " the right divine to govern wrong " alone 
made the dilemma a real one. Abstractly con- 
sidered, treason to James II., an arbitrary bigot 
bent on enslaving his people and restoring a 
creed to which nineteen twentieths of them 
were bitterly opposed, was not only justifiable 
but laudable, and the word must be stripped 
of its uglier connotations. But Churchill's 
case was a special one, involving special consid- 
erations. What we are to regard in weighing 
his conduct seems to be : his personal relations 
to James, the time and mode of his desertion, 
and, lastly and chiefly, his governing motives. 
There is no doubt that James had been from 
the first his fast friend and benefactor, having 
raised his whilom page step by step from pov- 
erty to wealth and from obscurity to distinction. 
Lord Wolseley's plea that " if we calmly weigh 



Marlborough's services and compare them with 
his rewards, the debtor and creditor account 
does not seem to be unfairly balanced," is 
hardly admissible, the double tie of fealty and 
gratitude being something more than a mere 
adjustable matter of debit and credit. Besides, 
the services of which Lord Wolseley speaks 
were rendered to James the king, who had 
an official right to ask them of Churchill the 
subject ; when the time came to repay James the 
man, at some personal cost and risk, Churchill 
was found more than wanting, for he left his 
benefactor in the lurch, and this at a moment 
when he knew his defection must prove decis- 
ive. The secession of Marlborough made it 
necessary for James to leave the field to his 
rival. In respect of the Revolution, two rela- 
tively honorable courses were open to Marl- 
borough. When he found James resolutely 
bent on restoring Roman Catholicism he should 
have thrown up his commissions and gone to 
Holland, as Talmash did, or else he should have 
followed his master's fortunes to the end. Both 
these courses meant a leap in the dark ; so he 
elected neither. At no juncture do we find this 
supremely cool and dispassionate gamester risk- 
ing a move the event of which could not be 
fairly reckoned beforehand. While intriguing 
and strengthening his hand with William he 
maintained his hold upon James ; and not till 
the chances were plainly and materially against 
the latter did he unmask. Then he boldly 
threw his sword in the descending scale and 
turned it hopelessly against his life-long friend 
and protector. With characteristic adroitness 
he contrived to hoodwink the King up to the 
last moment. Before leaving London to con- 
front William in the field, James made him a 
Lieutenant-General with an important com- 
mand. At the final council, after the fight at 
Wincanton, and Combury's ominous flight, 
when the King left it to the conscience of his 
officers to fight for him or else to openly and 
honorably resign their commissions, Churchill, 
with treachery in his heart, ostentatiously 
spurned the latter alternative. To further gild 
his spurious loyalty he even urged the now fal- 
tering King to strike a resolute blow for his 
crown. At this council James made a really 
touching appeal to the loyalty of his officers. 
He tells in his memoirs : 

" They all seemed to be moved at this discourse, and 
vowed they would serve me to the last drop of their 
blood the Duke of Graf ton and my Lord Churchill 
were the first that made this attestation." 

Three days later, " my Lord Churchill," see-

ing his way clear, went over to William ; and 
we confess that the questionable circumstances 
attending his treason throughout seem to us to 
outweigh, in an estimate of his character, the 
extenuating facts that its results were benefi- 
cial to his country and that James had for- 
feited his general claim on English loyalty. 

That the hero of Tel-el-Kebir should enlist 
on a forlorn hope is natural enough ; and we 
need not be surprised to find him trying to 
show, when he comes to the question of Marl- 
borough's motives, not only that his treason to 
James was the result of pure patriotism and 
zeal for religious liberty, but that he acted 
throughout in opposition to what he believed 
to be his own interests. Something more than 
bare logic is needed to show that the leopard 
can change his spots. The course indicated is 
so utterly at variance with what is known of 
Churchill's general character as to be incred- 
ible unless attested by the strongest facts. 
Theoretically speaking, no man capable of sac- 
rificing himself in the cause of patriotism 
could have acted as he did in the Brest mat- 
ter. Besides, the fact that as soon as James's 
restoration seemed fairly probable he began 
intriguing with him, and unblushingly pro- 
fessed the deepest contrition for his past con- 
duct, is fatal, we think, to our author's case. 
Tyranny and popery notwithstanding, Church- 
ill showed himself willing, other plans failing, 
to bring James back to the throne from which 
he himself, more than any other Englishman, 
had helped to oust him. The scene between 
Churchill and the Jacobite agent is instruct- 
ive : " Will you," pleaded the penitent rebel, 
" will you be my intercessor with the King ? 
Will you tell him what I suffer ? My crimes 
now appear to me in their true light ; and I 
shrink with horror from the contemplation. 
The thought of them is with me day and night. 
I sit down to table ; but I cannot eat. I throw 
myself on my bed ; but I cannot sleep," etc., 
etc. Perhaps Macaulay is not so far from the 
truth when he adds, " the loss of half a guinea 
would have done more to spoil his appetite and 
to disturb his slumbers than all the terrors of 
an evil conscience." To follow the tortuous 
maze of Churchill's policy is difficult enough ; 
but it is probable that, at bottom, his intrigue 
with James was only a part of his main design 
of placing on the throne his wife's puppet and 
" the Church's wet-nurse, Goody Anne." * 

That Churchill's religion was a factor in his 

* Walpole's epithet. 



disloyalty to James is beyond dispute. His 
Protestantism, while more a matter of early 
inoculation than reasoned conviction, was sin- 
cere ; and he honorably resisted all tempta- 
tions to abjure it. In this solitary virtue is 
rooted the disproof of our author's statement 
that Churchill, in aiding William to the throne, 
believed that he was sacrificing his own inter- 
ests. It had finally grown clear to him that, 
under James, his only road to immediate ad- 
vancement lay through apostasy " the one 
crime from which his soul recoiled." It was 
even evident, as we read in the Duchess of 
Marlborough's Vindication, " that as things 
were carried on by King James, everybody 
sooner or later must be ruined who would not 
become a Roman Catholic." Churchill did not 
wish to apostatize, still less did he wish to be 
ruined ; and events soon showed him a way out 
of the dilemma. Rarely skilled in casting the po- 
litical horoscope, he read in the growing discon- 
tents in the kingdom that even apostasy, what- 
ever its immediate rewards, was likely to prove 
a most doubtful way of advancing his inter- 
ests in the future. James's fatuity in, treat- 
ing like serfs a free people who had within the 
memory of the living sent their King to the scaf- 
fold for less, would plainly sooner or later cost 
him his throne ; and a Protestant successor was 
inevitable. Everything pointed to William of 
Orange as the most popular claimant. As soon 
as all this was clear to Churchill he made over- 
tures to William, and the event as usual proved 
his calculations to be correct. Such extraor- 
dinary services as he had it in his power to ren- 
der, through his talents, his military commands, 
and, above all, through his influence over Will- 
iam's strongest rival, Anne, could not go un- 
rewarded ; nor did they. On William's acces- 
sion he was promptly made Gentleman of the 
Bedchamber and Earl of Marlborough, and was 
once more on the high road to preferment. 

Allowing then all reasonable weight in the 
matter to Churchill's Protestantism, and even 
crediting him with a possible flash of fitful pa- 
triotism, it seems clear that his course in 1688 
might well have been dictated by the most 
cold-blooded self-interest. He had nothing to 
gain, as events were going, in standing by 
James ; he had everything to gain in going 
over to William. In fact Marlborough's course 
in the Revolution, when calmly considered, 
seems of a piece with his whole life and tem- 
per. His sense of James's past benefactions 
quickly vanished with his hope of benefactions 
to come ; and throughout the war of conflict- 



1894.]

ing policies and interests, cool and self-centred 
as at Blenheim and Malplaquet, he fought, like 
the Smith of Perth, "for his own hand." 

The world, or the saner and humaner part 
of it, will cheerfully agree with our author in 
condoning such of Marlborough's errors as may 
be fairly laid to the score of youth. It is mostly 
your " Unco Guid," or those frost-bitten souls 
who find their melancholy account in " damn- 
ing sins they have no mind to," who are im- 
placable in these cases. Marlborough's early 
surroundings, too, were of the worst, and would 
have tried Saint Anthony. To a handsome 
youth like John Churchill the court of Charles 
II., where chastity was scorned and common 
decency was laughed at as prudish, was a hot- 
bed of temptation ; and Lord Wolseley admits 
that his hero was naturally no Joseph. What 
Charles's court ladies were is indicated by the 
outspoken Pepys, who says : " Few will ven- 
ture upon them for wives. My Lady Castle- 
maine will in merriment say that her daughter 
(not above a year or two old) will be the first 
mayd in the court that will be married " ; 
while as to the court gentlemen, we read of 
44 orgies at which the Lord Chancellor, the Lord 
Treasurer, and other dignitaries, drank them- 
selves into a quarrelsome frenzy, and ended by 
stripping to their shirts." The court of the 
Restoration was little better than a magnified 
bagnio ; and the king who presided over it 
and set the mode in morals and manners was, 
with all his easy bonhomie and his singular 
turn for science, a Yahoo at bottom. That 
Churchill did not pass through the fire un- 
scathed is not to be charged against him too 
severely. But here again his more or less ven- 
ial errors were tainted and blackened by their 
sordid accompaniments. Avarice in youth is 
as ugly as lewdness in age ; and at two-and- 
twenty Churchill seems to have been steeped 
in this " good old-gentlemanly vice." We can 
forgive and even smile at his escapade of leap- 
ing through the Castlemaine's window to avoid 
" Old Rowley," who had been apprised of his 
poaching ; but when we learn that he after- 
wards accepted and carefully invested her lady- 
ship's draft in payment of his agility, our good- 
humor cools. There is probably more malice 
than truth in Pope's couplet touching this 
draft 

"The gallant, too, to whom she paid it down, 
Lived to refuse his mistress half a crown " 

but it is pretty clear that Churchill, " thrifty 
even in his vices," took wages compared to 
which the spoils of Turpin were nowadays 



counted honorable gains. Our author sub- 
stantially, and perhaps not altogether unjustly, 
partly excuses this acceptance of money on 
tne ground that " they all did it," and he in- 
clines to laud its investment as a case of thrift 
and foresight rather remarkable in so young 
a man. Thrift and foresight it certainly was ; 
for the Castlemaine gift, swelled by similar 
contributions from like quarters, proved to be 
the germ of the largest private fortune in Eu- 
rope. Marlborough's parsimony is neatly satir- 
ized in a verse suggested by the bridge at 
Blenheim a pretentious structure spanning a 
rivulet which trickles sparingly below : 

" The lofty arch his high ambition shows, 
The stream an emblem of his bounty flows." 

Lord Wolseley takes issue with those who 
have charged Marlborough with gross illiter- 
acy. He admits that his spelling was bad, but 
he urges that " in his time there was no recog- 
nized standard of spelling, and that if he failed 
in this respect, it was in company with Lord 
Chancellor Somers and a host of other well- 
known and even learned contemporaries." To 
carp at genius on the score of sixpenny de- 
fects which a year's schooling might have rem- 
edied is a small business ; and England may 
well forgive the victor of Blenheim for signing 
himself " Your lordchipe's humbell servant." 

We should regret if, while dwelling at length 
on those views of Lord Wolseley's which seem 
to us questionable, we had conveyed the im- 
pression that his book is a misleading or in the 
least degree an uncandid one ; and we repeat 
that its fairness and fulness of statement offset 
its sometimes doubtful logic. Ample data are 
furnished from which the reader may draw his 
own conclusions. The story of Marlborough's 
boyhood and school-days and of his youth is 
given with a fulness heretofore unattempted ; 
and the author has added a succinct and lively 
account of his period and of the people about 
him. The portraits of Charles and of James, 
of Sarah Jennings and her devoted " Mrs. Mor- 
ley," are capitally done, and show beyond ques- 
tion that Lord Wolseley, unlike his hero, can 
use the pen as well as the sword. Altogether 
admirable is the account of Sedgemoor and 
here our author has a signal advantage over 
Macaulay in that he is a thorough military ex- 
pert. His story of the battle is a foretaste of 
the treat awaiting us in the promised volumes 
embracing Queen Anne's wars. A man of ac- 
tion and a man of his time, Lord Wolseley 
treats himself to occasional " asides " (usually 
at the expense of the chronically-indignant

British taxpayer) on current questions. Com- 
menting on Sedgemoor, he says : 

" This, the last battle fought in England, was fought 
to secure James his crown. If through the folly and 
parsimony of our people we should ever see another, it 
will be fought in defence of London. The struggle will be 
not for a dynasty, but for our own very existence as an 
independent nation. Are we prepared to meet it ? The 
politician says Yes; the soldier and the sailor say No." 

Describing Monmouth, he says : 

" He was one of that sort of cut-and-dried, old-fash- 
ioned officers, who could not believe it possible that 
badly-armed, slovenly-looking regiments, untrained in 
the formal evolutions of a regular army, could be of 
any real military value. To officers of his class it was, 
and still is, heresy to hold that a man can be capable 
of doing a soldier's work unless he is dressed like a 
cockatoo, and drilled to stand like a ramrod, with his 
nose in the air." 

What would the Prussian drill-sergeant say to 
that? 

There are many illustrations largely por- 
traits after the Buccleugh miniatures ; and the 
volumes are at all points beautiful and even 
sumptuous pieces of book-making.

THE BOOKSELLERS OF THE PARIS QUAYS.* 

One of the earliest and most devoted of the 
class known as " book-lovers " those uncor- 
rupted and unjaded mortals who love and rev- 
erence a book per se as well as for what it con- 
tains was the good Bishop of Durham, Rich- 
ard de Bury (1287-1345). " O Blessed God of 
Gods in Zion ! " he writes in his Philobiblon, 
" how great a flood of pleasure delighted our 
heart as often as we had leisure to visit and 
sojourn at Paris, the paradise of the world, 
where the days always seemed to us but few for 
the greatness of the love that we had. There 
are delightful libraries, fragrant beyond stores 
of spices ; there are green pleasure-gardens of 
all kinds of volumes." The quays of Paris were 
undreamed of in de Bury's philosophy. The 
books he saw were not objects of barter in num- 
berless stalls planted along the banks of the 
Seine. They were the volumes in manuscript 
compiled by monkish scribes, with all the 
bravery of rubrication, and ornamentation in 
gold and colors, known to the plodding artists 
of mediaeval days. Movable types and printing 
presses came one hundred years (1450) after 
the death of Richard de Bury. Four hundred 
and fifty years more of progress have wrought

their changes. So, " in these vocal days " 
as Mr. Augustine Birrell tells us in his preface 
to M. Octave Uzanne's " Book-Hunter in 
Paris " " when there are books about almost 
everything under the sun, no one need wonder 
that so quaint a fraternity as the stall-keepers 
on the quays of the Seine should have a volume 
all to themselves." If one is to take M. Uzanne 
literally, the antiquated figure of the stall- 
keeper " who has disappeared " was cast in a 
quite different mould from the more prosaic 
stall-keeper of to-day. Pere Malorey, who died 
in January, 1890, had kept a stall on the Quai 
Conti, at the corner of the Pont des Arts, for 
sixty-two years. Strictly honest, of good sense, 
something of a scholar, he was " known and 
esteemed by the world of book-sellers, biblio- 
philes, and the learned, who found books at his 
stall and information in his talk," -says M. 
Uzanne. And this fine old gentleman was well 
satisfied with his business, and had no thought 
of rising above it. The stall-keeper of to-day 
is of another genus. Let M. Uzanne introduce 
him : 

" It is Chevalier, the old waiter at the Salle Sylvestre, 
well known for his indisguisable ignorance and his any- 
thing but Athenian idiom. He hardly knows how to 
read ; none the less his is one of the stalls where you 
will find the most books and the best books ; he has 
already made enough money to have his investments." 

It is usually the character of yesterday who 
interests us most ; so we turn back to Pere Foy, 
a quaint character, the friend of " the learned, 
the witty and lamented Bibliophile Jacob," 
Paul Lacroix. When the aesthetic soul of the 
late Emperor was perplexed by the appearance 
of pauper Paris, he would have swept away, as 
so many dealers in old rags, the stall-keepers 
on the quays. But their friend -Lacroix in- 
duced the Emperor to take a stroll with him one 
day ; and coming along the Quai Malaquais, 
they saw an old man warming himself at a fire 
of papers in a portable stove. To complete the 
story in M. Uzanne's words : 

" From time to time he took a volume from a pile of 
books by his side and tore out a handful of leaves to feed 
the fire. The Emperor approached, and, with some in- 
terest, wished to know what work was thought so value- 
less as to be used as a combustible. Pe*re Foy who is 
not acquainted with his reputation to-day ? quietly 
handed the volume to the Sovereign, and Napoleon III. 
read with stupefaction the headline in these triumphal 
words : ' Conquetes et Victoires des Francois.' " 

This dear old Pere Foy had a very checkered 
career. A fire finally destroyed the greater 
part of his stock of books, and the insurance 
company paid him in cash fifteen thousand 
francs. Thenceforth he did nothing ; " he did

not renew his books ; he did not change his 
clothes ; he let his feet protrude beyond his 
socks ; all the shirt he had was just enough to 
carry a collar." 

With such diverting stories, incidents, and 
experiences, M. Uzanne's book is filled. M. 
Emile Mas has sprinkled the text and the mar- 
gins with scenes and figures that are equally 
diverting. From the windows of his lodgings, 
M. Uzanue could see from the Pont Royal to 
the Pont des Arts " that long array of stalls 
that border the Seine, and which the curiosity 
of the loungers is passing under review from 
morn to eve "; and this picture, always within 
his view, he has reproduced in its many and 
varied phases, so that now the reader at a dis- 
tance can see the moving panorama of the quays 
as it has passed so often in review before the 
author. In the appendix is a very touching 
account of a notable banquet given to the book- 
stall men, in November, 1892, in accordance 
with the bequest of the late M. Xavier Mari- 
mer. About ninety-five stall-keepers were pres- 
ent at the banquet, and they spent a happy hour 
in discussing a repast the like of which was 
quite new to many of them.

The appearance of Mrs. Humphry Ward's third 
novel, " Marcella," again raises the inevitable ques- 
tion, Has George Eliot found a successor ? " David 
Grieve " was almost good enough to compel an af- 
firmative answer, but the new book gives us pause. 
" Marcella " is extremely tendenzios more so than 
" Robert Elsmere " but that is not necessarily 
a defect. Still, a great novelist should be able upon

occasion, as the author of "Adam Bede" showed 
herself, to discard preaching altogether without re- 
leasing the attention. This Mrs. Ward can hardly 
be said to have done as yet, although " David Grieve " 
promised much in that direction. Comparing Mrs. 
Ward with George Eliot, or, to be more specific, 
"Marcella" with "Felix Holt," we are conscious 
of two marked contrasts. The incomparable rich- 
ness of George Eliot's mind becomes only the more 
apparent when we put the two works side by side, 
although Mrs. Ward's pages always reflect a ripe- 
ness of culture and a degree of seriousness quite 
unwonted among writers of fiction. Furthermore, 
emotion sometimes gets the upper hand (or very 
nearly gets it) in Mrs. Ward's books, whereas George 
Eliot kept it strictly subordinated to intellect. We 
may say in addition that "Marcella" is more dis- 
tinctly a book of a single character than any of 
George Eliot's more considerable performances. The 
heroine is the only person who interests us very 
much ; her parents are imperfectly realized, her so- 
cialist friends are abstractions of varying degrees 
of shadowiness, the humble folk, whom she so pas- 
sionately desires to help, impress us chiefly with the 
squalor of their surroundings and arouse a sympa- 
thy that is mainly reflected from Marcella herself. 
Even her lover, Aldous Raeburn, has a touch of 
the priggishness that makes it possible to hold the 
type up to a sort of mild ridicule, as in the cases of 
Schiller's Marquis of Posa and Tennyson's King 
Arthur. As a general rule with the one rather 
notable exception of Wharton the characters of 
the novel seem to be delineated as they appear to 
Marcella's eyes rather than to the objective judg- 
ment of the artist who, " contemplating all," should 
project them one by one upon the scene, endowing 
each with its proper vitality. It is a little unfor- 
tunate that the artist should have thus abdicated to 
her creature, because Marcella, charming and high- 
minded as she appears to us, has no sense of humor, 
and is essentially a thing of impulse and passion. 
Now human life is never revealed in its truth to an 
observer under the sway of emotion, nor in its ful- 
ness to one who has tears for its sorrows but no

smiles for its mirth. Life is a terribly serious thing, 
no doubt, in many of its aspects, but it is fortunate 
that it is not always interpreted for us by so tensely- 
strung a medium as that of Marcella's nature. The 
book is occupied from beginning to end with the 
social problem in its more recent English envisage- 
ment. It calls, consequently, for examination as a 
study in sociology no less than as a transcript of 
life. What attitude towards socialism does it as- 
sume? Is the author carried away by sentimental- 
ism, or does she keep in constant view the hard un- 
compromising facts with which any settlement of 
the social problem must fit? The reader is con- 
stantly putting the questions to himself, and differ- 
ent portions of the work seem to offer varying 
answers. It is only when the end is reached, and 
the author's method taken fully into account, that 
these questions may be fairly answered. Then only 
will adequate credit be given to Mrs. Ward's dra- 
matic treatment of the subject; then only will the 
reader realize that the conflicting answers that from 
time to time seem to emerge merely reflect the 
phases of Marcella's storm and stress period of de- 
velopment, and that the poise of soul eventually at- 
tained by her is typical of what must be the final 
attitude (as far as finality in such matters is possi- 
ble) of every calm and rational nature brought face 
to face with the social problem. The critical point, 
in the development both of Marcella's character 
and of the problem with which she is struggling, 
appears to be reached when she declares to one of 
her socialist fellow- workers : 

" No ! so far as Socialism means a political system 
the trampling out of private enterprise and competi- 
tion, and all the rest of it I find myself slipping away 
from it more and more. No ! as I go about among 
these wage-earners, the emphasis do what I will 
comes to lie less and less on possession more and more 
on character. I go to two tenements in the same build- 
ing. One is Hell the other Heaven. Why ? Both 
belong to well-paid artisans with equal opportunities. 
Both, so far as I can see, might have a decent and 
pleasant life of it. But one is a man the other, with 
all his belongings, will soon be a vagabond." 

One need read no more than this to discern that 
Mrs. Ward's view of the social problem is both wise 
and conservative. No one, indeed, familiar with 
her earlier books, could reasonably have doubted 
that she would thus place the final emphasis upon 
character, or have feared that she would be misled 
by the allurements of any scheme, with whatever 
eloquence urged, that seeks to bring on earth peace, 
good-will toward men, by application from without. 
She might almost have taken for a motto these words 
of Dr. Ibsen : " Men still call for special revolutions 
for revolutions in politics, in externals. But all 
that sort of thing is trumpery." In style, " Mar- 
cella " is probably Mrs. Ward's best book. This 
makes an occasional slip all the more surprising, 
and we cannot understand how she could have used 
the word " demean " in the illiterate sense. It is 
also surprising to find Arnold's familiar 



" Yes ! in the sea of life enisled " 
misquoted as 

" On the broad seas of life enisled." 

For a near relative of the poet to have done this is 
less excusable than for another. 

The contrast is very striking between Mrs. Ward's 
restrained and thoughtful art and the careless and 
inartistic work displayed in " A Yellow Aster." 
These defects are partly accounted for by the very 
amateurish character of the performance, but there 
is a residuum of offensiveness not so pardonably to 
be explained away. The writer is clearly determined 
to be effective, and is fairly successful in her aim, 
but at the heavy cost of every grace of diction and 
nearly all verisimilitude. We are compelled to take 
more literally than she would probably wish the sug- 
gestion of the title, and to assert that her heroine 
is even more impossible than a yellow aster, or a 
black tulip, or any other horticultural monstrosity. 
It is a pity that the book should be so repellant to 
the artistic sense, for it has qualities of humor and 
pathos that are not without promise, and for which 
much might have been done by restrained and care- 
ful cultivation. But the writer has chosen to appeal 
to the roughened palate and the jaded sense, and she 
has her reward. Had she been wiser, she would have 
known that a sensational entrance into the field of 
literature is the thing above all others to be avoided 
by anyone who hopes to attract serious attention. 

The heroine of " The Rubicon " is something of 
a monstrosity, too, and in much the same way as 
the heroine of " A Yellow Aster." Both are wo- 
men who, we are given to understand, have enor- 
mous potentialities for love and self-sacrifice, but 
who, en attendant the development of these latent 
qualities, are capable of acting with phenomenal 
heartlessness and even brutality towards the men 
whom they have respectively pledged themselves to 
love, honor, and obey. The woman of " The Ru- 
bicon " is more seriously wicked than " Dodo," and 
far less attractive in her wickedness. But she has 
at least the grace to put an end to her destructive 
career by suicide, and the action becomes her, how- 
ever little the ethical finality attaching to it. The 
only merit of this novel is afforded by its occasional 
bits of bright observation and satirical comment ; as 
a piece of construction, it is slovenly both as to style 
and to composition in the larger sense. What is 
meant for a tragic climax (the scene in the opera box) 
is ludicrous in its ineffectiveness and inadequacy. 
" You are a wicked woman," says Reggie, and turns 
on his heel. The remark is truthful enough, but the 
particular instance offers nothing to occasion it. 

A new novel by Mr. Blackmbre could not fail to 
be an event of much importance, were the work less 
entertaining than " Perlycross." One undoubtedly 
feels that he has read it all before, and that the 
Devonshire village which gives the book its name 
is a spot long since familiar. One feels also that 
in this particular case the framework of the story 
is too slender for the wealth of ornamental detail

THE DIAL

bestowed upon it that there is an intolerable deal 
of sack for the poor half-pennyworth of bread. But 
the charm of Mr. Blackmore's manner is irresist- 
ible ; his humor is wholesome, and his poetic feel- 
ing is genuine and deep. " Perlycross " is not to 
be compared with the four or five best works of its 
author, but is, for all that, thoroughly enjoyable. 
Its very whimsicalities of style and temper are an 
essential element in its attractiveness, and quaintly 
help to set forth the old-fashioned, kindly, high- 
minded personality that we everywhere feel to lurk 
behind the scenes. 

The author of "An Englishman in Paris" has 
turned his hand to the composition of a detective 
story, and we cannot say that he has been success- 
ful. When we think of the work of M. Gaboriau, 
or even of Dr. Conan Doyle, "The Mystery of the 
Patrician Club " appears by comparison imperfectly 
conceived and clumsily unfolded. Mr. Vandam in- 
dulges in all the stock phrases of melodrama, and 
does not even spare us the " dull thud." There is 
nothing about the book that can be taken seriously, 
not even seriously enough for the purposes of the 
rather low type of fiction to which it belongs. But 
we do not always care to take things seriously in 
hot weather, and for an idle hour by the seaside 
the tale will serve. 

" With Edged Tools " (a title borrowed, it would 
seem, except for a variation in the spelling of the 
adjective, from Mr. Chatfield-Taylor's novel) is a 
book of alternating adventures in Africa and draw- 
ing-room conversations in London. It all turns 
upon the doings of a heartless coquette, who en- 
gages herself, in a manner, with two men at the 
same time. These men, unwitting of the tie that 
binds them, meet in Central Africa, and join in a 
money-making enterprise which turns out favorably. 
When they return to claim their promised brides, 
there turns out to be only one of her for both, and 
neither of them seems to care for her any longer. 
Whereby she gets her just deserts. The African 
part of the story relates to the search for a myste- 
rious shrub named simiacine, greatly desiderated 
by medicine men, and worth many times its weight 
in gold. There is hardly a real character or a 
natural situation in the book ; on the other hand, 
there is some cleverness of dialogue and abundant 
action. According as the reader cares for one or 
the other pair of characteristics, he may elect to 
read or to reject it. 

The novel of adventure seems just now to be hav- 
ing an English renaissance, and the popularity of 
such works as " The White Company " and " A Gen- 
tleman of France " points to a distinct reaction in 
popular taste from the allurements of realism and 
analysis. Mr. Westall's " For Honor and Life," 
which is a rather better book than the author has 
accustomed us to, is a story of the Swiss Guards, 
qui ne sacrimenti fidem fallerent, fortissime pug- 
nantes ceciderunt, on the tenth of August, 1792, 
thereby achieving immortality and the rock-carved 



Lion of Lucerne. The particular guard who is Mr. 
Westall's hero escaped the massacre of that day, 
otherwise there would have been no story for us. 
Of his subsequent connection with a plot to aid the 
escape of the King, of the fair maiden whose beaux 
yeux led him into numerous venturesome enter- 
prises, and of many other matters, we read with 
quite breathless interest, albeit with the cheerful 
conviction that a happy ending of the story awaits 
us in the closing chapter. 

Mr. David Christie Murray's latest novel has for 
its theme the rescue of an Italian patriot from the 
Austrian dungeon in which he had been left to rot 
for twenty years, and the subsequent activity of the 
rescued man in London as an organizer of the rev- 
olutionary movement of 1848. The rescuer, who 
tells his own story, is inspired by the fair eyes 
of the Italian's daughter, and, after many tribula- 
tions, makes her his wife. The story is told with 
the homely and affected bluffness supposed to befit 
the narrator, is filled with more or less exaggerated 
incident, and is sensational in tone without being 
more than moderately interesting. 

" Under the Red Robe " is sure of an audience, 
both because Mr. Weyman wrote it, and because 
the ever-fascinating figure of Richelieu dominates 
the action. Mr. Weyman gives us the Richelieu 
of Dumas and Lord Lytton rather than the car- 
dinal-minister of actual history, but few will quar- 
rel with him for that. Indeed, the Richelieu of 
romance seems assured of a genuine immortality, 
whatever may befall the annals of Louis XIII. and 
his reign. " Under the Red Robe " is an autobio- 
graphical episode. The hero is a decayed and dis- 
solute gentleman, sent by the Cardinal upon a per- 
ilous expedition to the Spanish frontier, and acquit- 
ting himself with much address and more grace than 
his antecedents would lead the reader to expect. 
The story is packed with adventure, and possessed 
of romantic charm in a high degree. Let Mr. Wey- 
man write a few more books of the sort, and he 
will fairly earn the title of the English Dumas. 

If the judgment be based upon the originality 
of plot, the best of the four novels of adventure in our 
present selection is " The Prisoner of Zenda." The 
scene is laid in one of the smaller German monarch- 
ies so plentiful before 1871, and the prisoner is the 
rightful king, held in confinement by his ambitious 
and unscrupulous brother. The hero is an adven- 
turous Englishman, whose extraordinary resem- 
blance to the prisoner enables him to personate the 
captive monarch, assume the crown in his place, and 
wear it successfully for three months. Fantastic, 
as the plot appears in this skeleton outline, it is 
given much verisimilitude by the ingenuity of the 
narrator. Uneasy lies the head, we may be sure, 
of this illegitimate crown-wearer, but the situation 
is saved by his pluck and his sagacity, and he suc- 
ceeds in rescuing and restoring to the throne his 
royal double. The story is singularly well-knit, 
rapid in action, and uninterruptedly interesting.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



There is no serious attempt at characterization, but 
much play of pleasing sentiment, and much dra- 
matic excitement, in its pages. 

A young English nobleman of profligate charac- 
ter and reckless disposition gets into a scrape, leaves 
his home, and begins a new life in the wilds of 
British America. There he marries a half-breed 
of French and Indian blood. The son of this 
union, when full-grown, learns of his English re- 
lations, and, the parents having died, goes to En- 
gland to claim his name and his family. Pretty 
nearly all novels nowadays deal with problems, and 
the problem of " The Trespasser " is to set forth 
the effect of this triple ancestry upon a man sud- 
denly brought into contact with the refinements of 
a highly civilized society. There is no trouble 
about recognition, and the new-comer holds his own 
in most respects, a strong character and a natural 
adaptability seeing him safely through many diffi- 
cult situations. But the wild strain in his blood as- 
serts itself in the end, and works much disaster. 
Mr. Parker's treatment of this theme is always in- 
teresting and often brilliant. The story is well- 
constructed and shows much dramatic power. If 
we may borrow one of the author's own phrases, 
we should say that there is a good deal of " raw 
color " about it. The subtleties of analytic art are 
not within Mr. Parker's reach, but he makes up for 
their lack by rather striking qualities of invention 
and imaginative passion. The entirely wanton in- 
troduction of an element of clairvoyant claptrap is 
the one marked fault of the book, and its uncanny 
effect is produced at too great a cost. 

Mr. Crawford is evidently ambitious to become 
the novelist of life in America as well as in Italy 
or the East, of life in New York no less than of 
life in Rome. It cannot fairly be claimed that he 
has succeeded in this task, and the reason is not far 
to seek. His talent is essentially romantic, and 
there is nothing romantic at all about New York 
society. He has made three attempts to handle 
this material: "The Three Fates," probably the 
weakest of all his books, " Marion Darche," a sketch 
too slight to be seriously considered, and " Kathar- 
ine Lauderdale," the book now under examination. 
All that we can say of it is that it is better than the 
two others. But it cannot for a moment be com- 
pared with the really remarkable " Saracinesca " 
novels, with " Pietro Ghisleri " or " Greifenstein," 
with " A Roman Singer " or " To Leeward." Clever 
and fluent as Mr. Crawford always is, the romantic 
remains his element, and the doings of " society " 
are almost as dull in his pages as they are in reality. 
His technique is nearly always good, and the reader 
can get some satisfaction from that. But even 
technique fails him in what may be taken as the 
central episode of " Katherine Lauderdale," and 
the spectacle of the hero solemnly invoking the tes- 
timony of the family physician to prove that he (the 
hero) is not drunk, excites to a mirthf ulness that can 
hardly have been contemplated by Mr. Crawford. 



A number of writer* have discovered of late that 
the history of this continent offers much material 
excellent for the purposes of romantic fiction. The 
present age, indeed, is not very romantic, except 
in the pages of Mr. Bret Harte, but one has only 
to get back a hundred years or so to find abundant 
inspiration. Mrs. Ryan is one of the latest explorers 
in these little-trodden regions, and her new novel, 
" A Flower of France," takes us to eighteenth cen- 
tury New Orleans, finding in its mixed population, 
its old-world relations, and its turbulent annals, so 
much interesting matter that her canvas suffers 
from being overcrowded. We cannot say that the 
material is very well arranged, or that the story is 
at all points probable, but the book is at least en- 
tertaining and deserves a certain degree of praise. 

The late Wolcott Balestier was a man of unusual 
personal charm, and was felt by more than one ju- 
dicious critic to exhibit the promise of literary 
achievement. At the time of his death his literary 
luggage was, it must be confessed, of the slender- 
est description, and it is not until recently that his 
most considerable work has seen the light in book 
form. " Benefits Forgot," with its taking Shake- 
spearian title, is a work of promise rather than of 
fulfilment, but the promise is at least nearer fulfil- 
ment than was the case with the three or four slighter 
predecessors of this story. Its author was still in 
the chrysalis stage, and evidently struggling towards 
the attainment of a distinctive manner. Whether 
he would have acquired such a manner is a problem 
never to be solved. His association with Mr. Kip- 
ling seems to have had an unfortunate effect ; 
throughout the book the presence of this alien in- 
fluence is felt. The attempt to write a Kiplingese 
adapted to American conditions results only in an 
unpleasant jerkiness of style and construction. Dur- 
ing the early chapters, the characters seem to have 
gone daft, so singular and inexplicable are their ac- 
tions. One would think them to be breathing the 
over-oxygenated atmosphere produced by the exper- 
iment of Doctor Ox rather than the rarefied air of 
Colorado altitudes. After we get used to their ec- 
centricities they seem to become more nearly nor- 
mal. As for the point of honor about which the 
whole story turns, the author himself does not seem 
to have been quite decided, and the question of 
right and wrong is obscured by not a little casuis- 
try. We are not told enough about the origin of 
the tangle concerning the ownership of the ranch 
and the mine to be quite sure as to what is right 
and what wrong. Questions of this sort may be 
settled in two ways : either by strict reference to the 
legal conditions or by appeal to the general fairness 
of the situation. Either settlement would be, in a 
way, satisfactory ; but Mr. Balestier got the technical 
and the moral claims inextricably confused, and 
does not provide the data for a disentanglement. 

Miss Woolson's posthumous novel is, like her ear- 
lier books, essentially a study of manners, although 
there is enough of passion to free the story from

THE DIAL

the reproach of monotony, and keep it well above 
the level of commonplace. The scene is mainly in 
the Asheville of twenty years ago, but shifted at 
times to the Florida that the author knew so well. 
The characters are drawn with admirable distinct- 
ness and vitality, those of Horace Chase and his 
wife bearing, in all their words and actions, the 
warrant of their own actuality. The self-righteous- 
ness of the sister-in-law, Genevieve, seems to us 
a little exaggerated, but, with this possible excep- 
tion, the characters have the singular merit of be- 
ing kept within truthful bounds under circumstances 
that would have tempted many writers to distortion 
for the sake of heightened effect. We should hardly 
say that " Horace Chase " will add noticeably to Miss 
Woolson's reputation, but it shows that her rather 
unusual powers were sustained to the last, and it is 
a worthy accession to the half-dozen books that 
stand as a memorial of one of the most capable and 
conscientious of our recent novelists. 

" If only there were more of it ! " will be the 
exclamation of most readers of " Overheard in 
Arcady," by Mr. Robert Bridges our own cis-At- 
lantic Robert Bridges. This altogether charming 
little book consists of a dozen bits of dialogue based 
upon the humorous fancy of bringing together the 
principal characters in a man's books, and setting 
them to talking about their creator. Thus, Bartley 
Hubbard, Fulkerson, Annie Kilburn, and others, 
talk about Mr. Howells ; Daisy Miller and the Mas- 
ter discuss Mr. Henry James ; the Lady and the 
Tiger converse about Mr. Stockton ; while Mr. Craw- 
ford falls into the hands of Corona Saracinesca, 
Russell Vanbrugh, Mr. Isaacs, and Ram Lai, who, 
strangely enough, all happen to meet on a P. and 0. 
steamer. That Mr. Bridges brings an audacious 
fancy to the execution of this novel idea is evident 
from mere mention of the dialogue between the 
Lady and the Tiger, and still more so from the fact 
that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in another of these 
ingenious compositions, calmly discuss their peculiar 
mutual relations. Here is a bit of the dialogue be- 
tween a few of Mr. Aldrich's characters : 

MAKJORIE : " There is the original Bad Boy now ! Don't 
you know Tom Bailey, of New York, the distinguished poli- 
tician and editor ? He is at the Surf House. ( Greetings and 
introductions). We were speaking of you. Mr. Flemming 
thinks your biography the best of Mr. Aldrich's novels." 

BAILEY (in despair) : " Can I never live down that awful 
tale of my youth ! Some people really believe that I did all 
those things. I think I should have been nominated for gov- 
ernor last June if a rival paper had not unearthed what it 
called my ' Terrible Record as a Boy in Rivermouth.' " 

FLEMMING (laughing) : " I remember, but I heard a dozen 
men at the club declare that they would like to have a chance 
to vote for the original of the Bad Boy. They all looked upon 
you as the friend of their youth. I have n't a doubt that every 
winter a wave of midnight explosions sweeps over the villages 
of this country. It means that the next crop of boys has been 
i eading the ' Story of a Bad Boy .' It is passed along from gen- 
eration to generation of village youngsters with ' Tom Brown' 
and ' Verdant Green.' That is true immortality for an author. 
There are no books we love so long, no authors we remember 
so kindly, as those we read and delighted in when young." 

BAILEY (with mock earnestness) : " Then I 'm condemned to 



go down to posterity as the terror of good parents and cor- 
rect school-teachers. I am even mistrusted by the village 
police everywhere ! " 

MAKJORIE (cutting in) : " But the village girls won't love 
you the less for it." 

FLEMMING (judiciously) : " Aldrieh did one very fine thing 
with the ' Bad Boy'; he annihilated the prig in American ju- 
venile literature for a generation." 

MARJORIE : " And that 's almost as good as being the de- 
lightful poet that he is. (A maid appears in the doorway.) 
And now we T ll have luncheon." (Exeunt.) 

When we say that "Overheard in Arcady" is as 
good as this throughout, we should do enough to 
send it a host of readers. " A Little Dinner in Ar- 
cady " closes the volume, the guests being English 
and American novelists and such of their characters 
as Daisy Miller, Diana (of The Crossways), Meh 
Lady, and the Princess Saracinesca. " Life," who 
acts as host, explains the seating : " I told each man 
to bring one of his own family. Then I mixed the 
names in a hat and drew this combination." The 
conversation is after such fashion as the following : 

DAISY MILLER: "Think of our flattering Charley Rich 
and his set. They are so conceited now that they think all 
the girls are in love with them. We have to train all the 
young nobs down with sarcasm before they are endurable. 
We are onto their style." 

PRINCESS SARACINESCA (to Page): "What queer English 
that young woman speaks ! I fear that I must have had an 
uncultivated teacher in Rome. It 's all so strange to me." 

PAGE : " You must come and visit us in Ole Vahginia, my 
deah lady, to heah the real old English language. We are 
descended from the Cavaliers, madam." 

PRINCESS: "Now, I understand the peculiar spelling in 
'Marse Chan.' It's old English, isn't it, like Chaucer and 
Beowulf?" 

PAGE (shifting the subject): "Oh, I say, Meh Lady, you 
must invite the Princess down to the old plantation. She is 
writing a book about America, and I reckon it will be all Bos- 
ton and New York, as usual, unless we divert her." 

MRS. HAWKSBEE : " Invite me too, please. I want to see 
America. I only know what I 've read about it in Mr. James's 
novels, and what Mr. Kipling has told me." 

BUNNER (behind his hand to Page) : "She must have a 
beautiful chromo picture of us then in her mental gallery. 
Imagine taking your impression of America from James and 
Kipling!" 

We must say in closing that the fun in which Mr. 
Bridges indulges is always good-natured, and that 
it serves as a mask for not a little genial and se- 
rious criticism the criticism that delights in pay- 
ing tribute to whatever it finds that is lovely and of 
good report in the work under consideration. 

Some of the many volumes of short stories that 
have recently been published seem to call for a few 
words of description or comment. The characteristics 
of Mr. Thomas Hardy's work are so well known as 
hardly to need re-statement. * 1 ' Life's Little Ironies " 
is the title given to a score of tales and character 
sketches. They deal with people who would be abso- 
lutely uninteresting in the hands of any less a mas- 
ter, and even his genius has much to contend with 
in their presentation. " A Tragedy of Two Ambi- 
tions " and "On the Western Circuit" are perhaps 
the strongest of these aptly-entitled tales. Miss 
Harraden's " In Varying Moods " will probably 
attract more attention than it deserves. The stories 



368 



[June 16, 



are very slight, and the mark of the amateur senti- 
mentalist is upon them. " The Umbrella-Mender," 
the best and most original of them, is a little sugges- 
tive of Hawthorne. Of the six stories in Mrs. Foote's 
volume, four are upon the Western themes that she 
handles with such picturesque effect and easy mas- 
tery. These are distinctly the best, and among them 
" In Exile " and " The Watchman " seem to us the 
most attractive. They exhibit many of the qualities 
displayed by Mr. Bret Harte, although without his 
humor. In its place there is a certain gravity and 
a certain reserved poetical feeling that may be held 
sufficient to make up the balance. There are eight 
stories in Mr. Ward's volume, widely varied in their 
themes. The author has considerable powers of in- 
vention, but they often lead him to forced and even 
preposterous situations. More than once, also, does 
he give the cord of sensibility a decided wrench. 
But the stories are readable, and more ; at their best 
they are strongly interesting. The volume of seven 
stories just published by Mr. Davis shall serve us for 
a bonne louche. We are inclined to think " The 
Exiles " the best story that Mr. Davis has written, 
although " His Bad Angel " is a good second. It 
would certainly be rash to say that all the good 
stories have been told as long as the fertile genius 
that has given us these and so many others is at 
work. Few writers know so well what to say, just 
how to arrange it, or just when to stop. There is 
not a wearisome page in the volume, and the author 
shows himself singulai-ly independent of the hack- 
neyed devices of the professional story-teller.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Public Libraries 
in America. 



Mr. William I. Fletcher's little book 
on "Public Libraries in America" 
(Roberts), written for Professor 
Todd's " Columbian Knowledge " series, is so good 
a book for its purpose that we fear our few remarks 
will do it but imperfect justice. It discusses, in 
brief chapters that almost invariably contain just 
the things that ought to be said and no others, such 
subjects as library legislation, buildings, catalogues, 
and management, the relation of the library to the 
community, the selection of books, and the training 
of the librarian. One may find words of soberness 
and wisdom upon nearly every page. We select a 
few examples. " ' First, appoint your librarian,' is 
a maxim worthy the attention of newly formed 
boards of trustees." "Experience has shown that 
care is necessary to avoid the opposite dangers, on 
the one hand of a library administration left to the 
mercy of shifting politics, and on the other of one 
run as a close corporation tending naturally to be- 
come a one-man power." "The way, then, to start 
a library is to start it, not to make great plans and 
invoke State aid at the outset ; but in a simple way 
to make a beginning from which the library may 



grow." " A well-ordered library must admit read- 
ers to its shelves, where, under proper restric- 
tions, they may look over the books on a given sub- 
ject and not be confined to the narrow range im- 
posed by the limitations of reading-room use." The 
whole gospel of library architecture is condensed 
into this sentence : " The order should be to require 
the architect to put a presentable exterior on an in- 
terior having only use in view, and not, as is so 
often done, to require the librarian to make the best 
he can of an interior imposed by the exigencies of 
the architect's taste or the demand of a building 
committee for a monumental structure." Here are 
some golden words upon the selection of books r 
"Sometimes the work of selection is allowed to 
pass into the hands of some one who is supposed to 
be competent because he is a book-fancier, possibly 
something of a bibliomaniac, but who fills the library 
with books which constitute a literary museum, rather 
than a literary laboratory or workshop." On the sub- 
ject of cataloguing, Mr. Fletcher entertains the ra- 
tional notion that a catalogue should be made intel- 
ligible to those who want to use it. This doctrine 
needs urging in view of the recent vogue of systems 
that only the initiated can understand. " The classi- 
fication schemes," Mr. Fletcher says, "proceed on 
the idea of taking the whole field of knowledge as 
the unit, and dividing and subdividing it by some 
logical process, with a large infusion of arithmetic 
in the case of the decimal systems and some others. 
They are thus quite completely theoretical, and in 
practice are too rigid and mechanical to fit the nat- 
ural differentiation of books one from another ; for 
the books in a library do not lend themselves to 
such a process of logical subdivision." As an illus- 
tration of his views, the author gives us a simple 
outline classification of the books likely to be found 
in the general public or college library, and his pub- 
lishers have reprinted this chapter in a volume by 
itself, with the title, " Library Classification." We 
should like to discuss the thoughtful chapter on 
"Library Laws," but must refer readers to the book 
for that. As a compendium of fact, Mr. Fletcher's 
little treatise is of much value. We note particu- 
larly its history of the library movement in Amer- 
ica, its account of special libraries and collections,, 
and its tables of library statistics. The illustrations, 
also, are remarkably well chosen, being mostly plans 
of buildings and portraits of librarians. Among the 
latter we note the fine likeness of W. F. Poole, and 
the biographical sketch ending with mention of his 
recent death "the heaviest loss American libra- 
rianship has known." Perhaps the best thing we 
can say of Mr. Fletcher's book is that Dr. Poole 
would have given his cordial approval to almost 
every line of it. 

The sixth volume of Professor Hux- 
ley's "Collected Essays " (Appleton) 
is a reprint of the " Hume " written 
for the " English Men of Letters " series, supple- 
mented by two chapters on Berkeley. We learn 



Prof, Huxley's 
Studies in 
Philosophy.

THE DIAL 



369 



from the introduction that the author once expected 
to write a companion volume on Berkeley, " but the 
burdens and distractions of a busy life led to the 
postponement of this, as of many other projects, till 
too late." The chapters here included are really 
studies for that work. The following remarks, which 
cannot be accepted without some reserve, indicate 
Professor Huxley's attitude towards the fundamen- 
tal problems of philosophy, and at the same time 
suggest the limitations, which are not only his own, 
but those of Mr. Herbert Spencer as well. The re- 
marks take the form of a word of advice to the 
younger generation. " If it is your desire to dis- 
course fluently and learnedly about philosophical 
questions, begin with the lonians and work steadily 
through to the latest new speculative treatise. If 
you have a good memory and a fair knowledge of 
Greek, Latin, French, and German, three or four 
years spent in this way should enable you to attain 
your object. If, on the contrary, you are animated 
by the much rarer desire for real knowledge ; if 
you want to get a clear conception of the deepest 
problems set before the intellect of man, there is 
no need, so far as I can see, for you to go beyond 
the limits of the English tongue. Indeed, if you are 
pressed for time, three English authors will suffice ; 
namely, Berkeley, Hume, and Hobbes." From these 
three writers one may get, we are told, " as much 
sound philosophical training as is good for any- 
one but an expert." This statement is so near the 
truth that we almost regret to insist upon the claims 
of Kant and Schopenhauer. Yet there can be no 
doubt that they also are "good for anyone," not 
even an expert, and that, furthermore, they sup- 
ply certain elements absolutely essential to the com- 
prehension of the philosophical problem, elements 
hardly to be got from a study of the author's great 
trio of English thinkers. 

Baynes's The Shakespearian studies of the 

Shakespearian late Thomas Spencer Baynes, to- 
studies. gether with a paper on "English 

Dictionaries," have been collected in a volume now 
published (Longmans), and prefaced by a bio- 
graphical sketch of the author. This sketch is the 
work of Professor Lewis Campbell, and gives an 
excellent idea of the activity displayed by Baynes 
as a professor of philosophy and literature, as a 
journalist, and as editor of the "Encyclopaedia 
Britannica." The Shakespearian studies now re- 
printed include the following: "What Shakespeare 
Learnt at School," " Shakespearian Glossaries," 
" New Shakespearian Interpretations," and the 
" Encyclopaedia Britannica " article on Shakespeare. 
Of the latter, the editor says with justice: "The 
strength of this essay lies not so much in the spe- 
cial as in the general preparation of the writer. 
It was deeply rooted in his own life, and drew upon 
his whole past experience, in the world, not less 
than in the study. His attempt to replace Shake- 
speare in his actual environment is wonderfully suc- 
cessful, and amid such a farrago of all shades of 



probability, to have taken a definite line and held to 
it with so much substantial likelihood, is surely a re- 
markable achievement." Of this essay Bishop Words- 
worth said : " I can only describe it as represent- 
ing an enormous amount of multifarious reading 
and of energetic thought, boiled down to a consist- 
ency so refined that it gives no sign of the process 
it has undergone. It strikes me as the most won- 
derfully massive and complete piece of work in the 
way of literary criticism I have ever seen ; and I 
doubt whether there is anything to equal it in that 
line." This is of course exaggerated, but the sub- 
stantial value of the biography, as well as of the 
other papers in this volume, is not to be disputed. 
The study of "What Shakespeare Learnt at School" 
is particularly valuable. By a careful examination 
of the grammar schools of the sixteenth century, 
and of the books used in them, it is found possible 
to construct with something like completeness the 
poet's early education, while the conclusions thus 
reached from a priori reasoning are abundantly cor- 
roborated by careful examination of the plays them- 
selves. It is particularly instructive to compare the 
prominent place given to Ovid in the schools of the 
time, on the one hand, with Shakespeare's marked 
fondness for and familiarity with that poet, on the 
other. So much prodigious nonsense has been 
written about Shakespeare's learning that it is com- 
forting to find the subject sanely discussed from a 
rational point of view. 



Old Celtic 
Romances. 



In the second edition of Dr. P. W. 
Joyce's " Old Celtic Romances " 
(Macmillan), we find twelve charm- 
ing old tales part verse, part prose translated 
from the original Gaelic manuscripts as preserved in 
Trinity College and in the Royal Irish Academy, 
Dublin. His principle of translation has been to 
preserve the spirit and manner rather than the ex- 
act words ; the originals being simple in style, the 
English is of the kind he supposes the old shanachies 
(professional story-tellers) themselves would have 
used, had they spoken English instead of Gaelic. 
Like the Welsh legends of Arthur and his Round 
Table, or the Arabian romances of Haroun-al-Ras- 
chid and his Court, these stories centre generally 
around the exploits of some favorite hero. One of 
them, "The Voyage of Maildun," a tale of the 
eighth century, has an added interest from the fact 
that it was Dr. Joyce's translation that furnished 
Tennyson the inspiration for his poem " The Voy- 
age of Maeldune." 

In "An Old Master and Other Po- 
litical Essays" (Scribner), Professor 
Woodrow Wilson gives some valu- 
able contributions to political science. In the first 
and second papers of the volume "An Old Mas- 
ter" (who is Adam Smith), and "The Study of 
Politics " he discusses methods of investigation 
and presentation in this science, and makes an elo- 
quent plea for men who, like Adam Smith, " will

dare to know a multitude of things. Without them 
and their bold synthetic methods, all knowledge and 
all thought would fall apart into a weak analysis. 
Their minds do not lack in thoroughness : their thor- 
oughness simply lacks in minuteness." The third 
essay is a sound presentation of " Political Sov- 
ereignty " as resident in " the law-making organ of 
the State, in contravention of the crude theorizing 
that would lodge it in the people. The substance 
of the fourth and fifth papers, on " Character of 
Democracy in the United States " and " Govern- 
ment Under the Constitution," is a demand for re- 
sponsible leadership in our government, which shall 
bring organization and unity into our now hope- 
lessly sporadic methods of legislation, and shall 
fasten upon Congress " an even more positive form 
of accountability than now rests upon the President 
and the courts." The methods of " An Old Mas- 
ter " pervade this valuable little book. 



A pioneer 
worker for 
women. 



Mary Mortimer was one of that band 
of earnest women, of whom Cathe- 
rine Beecher was the chief, who half 
a century ago did so much for the cause of the ed- 
ucation of women in what was then " the new West." 
It seems almost like ancient history to read of the 
difficulties and the strangeness of their work, as told 
by Mrs. Minerva Brace Norton in " Mary Morti- 
mer : A Memoir " (Revell). Milwaukee was one of 
the promising young cities in which their labors were 
most successful, and Miss Mortimer spent nearly 
twenty-five years of her life as Principal of Mil- 
waukee Female College. The record of her able 
and inspiring career, her wide and gracious influ- 
ence over the many young lives with whom she 
came in contact, has been written by a careful and 
affectionate hand. Such lives must ever be worthy 
of tribute, since, to quote Miss Mortimer's own 
words, " Few things are so soul-cheering in the 
weary pilgrimage of life as the knowledge, brought 
home to one's heart, of the life and triumphs of 
genius and goodness." 



Waymarks 
in Church 
History. 



In a volume entitled "Waymarks 
in Church History" (Longmans), 
William Bright, D.D., Canon of 
Christ Church, Oxford, and Regius Professor of 
Ecclesiastical History, has collected a dozen of his 
lectures and articles written for Church magazines 
during the decade 1883-93. The subjects, includ- 
ing Gnosticism, Ante-Nicene Sectarianism, the 
Arian Controversy, S. Basil, the controversies of 
the fourth and fifth centuries, Cyril of Alexandria, 
Pelagianism, the Papacy, the Clergy and Secular 
Employments, Bede and Laud, may seem, at first 
glance, already well worn, but each is treated with 
direct reference to some recent question which has 
arisen, thus giving to the papers a present-day in- 
terest. The collation and republication of the es- 
says have not only provided the opportunity for 
careful recension, but also for the addition of an 
important appendix to each. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Volume 47 of " The Century," now published in cloth 
covers, is noticeable for its articles about Napoleon, mu- 
sical composers, and Abraham Lincoln, for its publica- 
tion of three papers by James Russell Lowell, for " Mark 
Twain's" " Pudd'nhead Wilson" and Mrs. Foote's 
" Cffiur d'Alene," and for the 340 illustrations, among 
which Mr. Timothy Cole's Dutch masters are easily first. 
These engravings from Rembrandt, Jan Steen, and 
Frans Hals are worthy successors of the Italian masters 
included in Mr. Cole's earlier series. 

Mr. George Waring, Jr., translates from the Dutch 
of Heer J. G. W. Fijnje van Salverda an interesting lit- 
tle book on " Aerial Navigation " (Appleton), and sup- 
plements it by a resume of the recent experiments of 
Professor Langley and others. The book is timely, for 
its subject is " in the air," and most mechanics who have 
followed the course of recent experimental work look 
for a speedy practical application of the principles that 
have been established by Messrs. Langley, Maxim, and 
Holland. It is hardly necessary to say that the balloon 
idea is now practically abandoned, and that mechanics 
look to some form of aeroplane as the solution of the 
problem presented. 

Professors W. A. Stevens and Ernest D. Burton have 
collaborated in the preparation of " A Harmony of the 
Gospels for Historical Study" (Silver, Burdett & Co.). 
The version of 1881 is taken as a basis, and from it the 
editors have made an analytical synopsis of the four 
gospels, employing the device of parallel columns as far 
as it is practicable to do so. The work is a " Harmony " 
in the sense of an exhibit, not of an explanation or re- 
conciliation. There are nine principal divisions of the 
narrative with many sections and sub-sections. The ap- 
paratus of the book is quite elaborate and complete, but 
too complicated to be mastered without considerable 
study. When mastered, it ought to prove very helpful. 

The two-volume work upon " Big Game Shooting " 
(Little, Brown & Co.), which Mr. Clive Phillipps-Wol- 
ley has edited for the " Badminton " library, is a verit- 
able encyclopaedia for that sportsman whose ambition 
soars above the domestic hare or the grouse of his na- 
tive heath. It includes nearly two score of articles by 
the best specialists upon the several subjects included 
there being articles by such mighty hunters as Sir Sam- 
uel Baker, Mr. F. C. Selous, Mr. Warburton Pike, and 
Mr. W. A. Baillie-Grohman. The volumes are abund- 
antly and artistically illustrated. 

Among late modern language texts we note Herr 
Freytag's " Der Rittmeister von Alt-Rosen," one of the 
" Alineii " series, edited, with an interesting introduc- 
tion, by Professor James T. Hatfield; Schiller's "Maria 
Stuart," edited by Prof. Lewis A. Rhoades; and an 
adaptation, by M. P. Desages, of Me*rimeVs " La Chron- 
ique de Charles IX." All three of these books are ad- 
ditions to the lengthy list of Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

That pleasant poet, William Browne of Tavistock, 
who wrote " Britannia's Pastorals " and many other 
things, now makes a two-volume appearance in the 
" Temple " library (Scribner), for which his works have 
been edited by Mr. Gordon Goodwin. Mr. A. H. Bul- 
len's introduction adds a distinct charm to this already 
charming edition. We note that the present editor very 
definitely assigns to Browne the familiar lines " On the 
Countess Dowager of Pembroke," and the evidence cer- 
tainly favors his authorship as against that of Jonson, 
or indeed of any other.

YORK TOPICS. 

New York, June 11, 1894, 

With the opening of the summer season, novels are 
more than ever the books of the hour. The success of 
some of them is really phenomenal. Mr. Crawford's 
" Katharine Lauderdale " is now in its sixth edition, and 
Mrs. Ward's " Marcella " has, I believe, reached a fifth 
large edition in this country alone. Publishers are con- 
sidering manuscripts sent them with more and more 
care, fearful of overlooking what may prove to be the 
success of the season. This is particularly true of novels 
offered them for copyright publication by English pub- 
lishers. Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. believe that " A 
Daughter of Music," by G. Colmore, an English lady, 
which they have just brought out, will attract the same 
general attention here that it is gaining in England, 
where it has been compared to " Wuthering Heights." 
This firm has been very active in securing the works of 
leading novelists. Messrs. Appleton will publish Mr. 
S. R. Crockett's next volume, "The Lilac Sunbonnet," 
and they have arranged to issue Dr. Conau Doyle's 
coming novels. They will also publish Mr. Hall Caine's 
"The Manxman" in the fall. In their "Town and 
Country Series " will soon appear " Outlaw and Law- 
maker," by Mrs. Campbell Praed, " A Mild Barbarian," 
by Edgar Fawcett, and " Dr. Janet of Harley Street," by 
Arabella Kenealy. They will also publish Miss Kate 
Sanborn's " Abandoning an Adopted Farm," which re- 
counts her amusing failure in adopting a farm pre- 
viously abandoned by someone else, and which of course 
is a sequel to her former book on the same subject. 
This will appear in Messrs. Appletons' new "Handy 
Volume Series," in which they .will reissue " Mrs. Lim- 
ber's Raffle," a novel by Mr. William Allen Butler, pub- 
lished anonymously some ten years ago and now first 
acknowledged by the author of " Nothing to Wear." 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers appear to be reaching 
out Bostonwards, for they announce a volume by Mrs. 
Harriet Prescott Spofford, "The Scarlet Poppy, and 
Other Stories." One or two of these stories have ap- 
peared in this firm's periodicals. The book includes, 
besides the title story, " The Tragic Story of Binns," 
" The Composite Wife, " Mrs. Claxton's Skeleton," and 
other of Mrs. Spofford's always fresh and entertaining 
studies. Mr. John Kendrick Bangs, the author of that 
weirdly grotesque volume, " Toppleton's Client," will 
bring out through Messrs. Harper " The Water Ghost, 
and Others," a book of ghost-stories full of the spark- 
ling dialogue, original situations, and the pervasive hu- 
mor in which this author excels. 

New volumes of fiction announced by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. are "A Suburban Pastoral, and Other 
Tales " by Professor Henry A. Beers, of Yale Univer- 
sity, and " Quaker Idyls " by Mrs. S. M. H. Gardner. 
Professor Beers's standard manuals of English and 
American literature, his life of Willis, and his volume 
of poems, " The Thankless Muse," have made him known 
aside from his college work. The present volume is 
the first collection of his stories which has been made. 
The title story is perhaps the best sketch of suburban 
life in an American city yet written. Professor Beers's 
stories are marked by powerful but artistically sup- 
pressed feeling. Almost all of them relate to American 
life. Mrs. S. M. H. Gardner is a resident of Andover, 
Mass., but the scenes of her " Quaker Idyls " are laid 
in Philadelphia, and some of them deal with anti-abo- 
litionist times. 



It is more than ten years since Mr. Edgar Fawcett 
began the publication of a series of novels and short 
stories, the scenes of which were laid in New York 
modern New York, that is. It had occurred to him to 
look about his native city and to make use of metropol- 
itan scenes and types familiar to him from boyhood. 
Some of the sketches in his volume of " Social Sil- 
houettes," while lacking nothing in romantic quality, 
presented to view most lifelike personifications of char- 
acters common in our social life. Almost at the same 
time with Mr. Fawcett's occupation of the New York 
field, a number of other novelists selected the same 
ground as the locality of their stories, notably Mr. 
Henry C. Bunner, Mr. William Dean Howells, and Mr. 
William Henry Bishop, to say nothing of a host of lesser 
writers. Just at present there seems to be a revival of 
the New York novel. It is hard to say whether the 
city is becoming more interesting, but at least Mrs. 
Burton Harrison with her " Bachelor Maid," Mr. Ma- 
rion Crawford with his " Katharine Lauderdale " and 
the sequel he is now writing, and Mr. Charles Dudley 
Warner with his new " Harper " serial, " The Golden 
House," have found it worth their while to write about 
things " here at home." 

A curious paragraph has been going the rounds, to 
the effect that the Rev. Walter Mitchell, whose " Two 
Strings to his Bow " has just been published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., is the author of an earlier 
novel entitled " Tacking Ship off Shore." Readers of 
the " Atlantic Monthly " will remember that " Tacking 
Ship off Shore " was a poem, and it is, I think, one of 
the finest sailing-poems in the language. Mr. Mitchell's 
former novel, " Bryan Maurice," was first published in 
1866 and reissued in 1888. During the Puritan Gen- 
esta races he published another fine sailing poem, " The 
Cup Defender," which was widely copied. 

The death of Mr. Thomas Niles, of Messrs. Roberts 
Brothers, Boston, was a great surprise to most of his 
friends, but it appears that he had suffered from peri- 
odical attacks of illness for some time, although saying 
little about it. He was much liked by all publishers 
and authors who knew him, and gained an enviable rep- 
utation for fair dealing. He was not, as has been gen- 
erally stated, the sole owner of the publishing-house 
with which he was connected, Mr. Roberts being the 
chief owner and having always taken an active part in 
the business, though preferring to remain in the back- 
ground. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Niles shared equally in 
the literary and business management. 

Messrs. Roberts Brothers recently brought out a copy- 
righted edition of George Egerton's " Keynotes," which 
they accepted on its merits, and which they are thus 
able to sell exclusively in this country. They are just 
about to publish "The Dancing Faun," by Florence 
Farr, for which they anticipate an equal success. Both 
these volumes have decorative title-pages designed by 
Aubrey Beardsley, which indeed are quite the fashion. 
The Edinburgh edition of the works of Robert Louis 
Stevenson, in twenty volumes, will be published in this 
country by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, who have 
secured a portion of the limited and only edition of one 
thousand copies. The consent of four English publish- 
ing houses was necessary in order to perfect the plan of 
this edition. It will be published in library style, with 
little decorative matter, save a few frontispieces, under 
the supervision of Mr. Sidney Colvin. There will be 
three volumes of "Miscellanies," including early writ- 
ings and unsigned articles from periodicals. In quite

[June 



another department of literature, I do not see why some 
one does not collect Mr. Howells's variously published 
works in a similar standard edition. Mr. Noah Brooks's 
" Tales of the Maine Coast " is just out, and will be wel- 
comed as his first volume of fiction for grown-up readers. 
He is now once more a resident of Castine, Maine, his 
birthplace, and he has endeavored with success to por- 
tray the characteristics of the people and the natural 
scenery of the Maine coast. Many of his characters are 
drawn from real life, and the town of Castine itself is 
thinly disguised as " Fairport." The titles of some of 
the stories are " Pansy Pegg," " The Apparition of Jo 
Murch," The Phantom Sailor," " The Waif of Nautilus 
Island," and " A Century Ago."

LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY. 

Mr. Ruskin's " Verona and Other Lectures " will be 
issued in this country by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

" Fliegende Blatter," the national comic paper of Ger- 
many, is now issuing its hundredth semi-annual volume. 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. have in preparation an edi- 
tion of Coleridge, to be edited by Mr. Stopford Brooke. 
William Roscher, the great German economist, died 
at Leipzig on the fourth of this month, at the age of 
seventy-six. 

A London correspondent reports that Mr. W. W. 
Astor has contracted to pay 2850 for the serial rights 
of Mr. Stevenson's next novel. 

The " Bibliotheque Nationale " of France has decided 
to print the catalogue of its collection, which, amount- 
ing to more than two and a half million volumes, is the 
largest in the world. 

Mr. F. Marion Crawford, who, as readers of " The 
Witch of Prague " know, has dabbled a little in mod- 
ern mysticism, contributes to " Book Reviews " (Mac- 
millan) for June an article called " A Modern View of 
Mysticism." His discussion of the subject is somewhat 
too credulous to be taken very seriously. 

It was fitting that M. Bourget should succeed his 
master Taine in the French Academy, and hardly less 
so that M. Albert Sorel should have been awarded the 
chair left vacant by the death of Maxime Ducamp. M. 
Sorel's most important work is " L' Europe et la Re'vo- 
lution Franchise," in four volumes. 

The death of the Hon. Roden Noel is cabled from 
London. He was born in 1834, and educated at Trin- 
ity College, Cambridge. His books include " Behind 
the Veil, and Other Poems" (1863), "Beatrice, and 
Other Poems" (1868), "A Little Child's Monument" 
(1881), and "Essays upon Poetry and Poets" (1886). 
The following " true story " is from " The Westmin- 
ster Gazette": "Mr. Elliot Stock recently published a 
new edition of Thomas k Kempis. A favorable review 
was cut out by a news-cutting agency, and addressed to 
' Thomas A. Kempis, Esq.,' care of his publisher, inti- 
mating that on payment of a guinea he could be supplied 
with all references to his writings." 

Signer Gallina, the Italian playwright and poet, has 
been granted a yearly pension of $500 by the syndic 
and municipality of Venice, to enable him to continue 
writing without continually facing the necessity of seek- 
ing other employment to keep the wolf from the door. 
For twenty years he has been writing plays which are 



likely to rank with Goldoni's in mirroring actual Ital- 
ian life, and his admirers will rejoice to know that his. 
long struggle against poverty is practically ended. 

A " Universal Index to the World's Technical and 
Scientific Literature " is announced for publication in. 
Vienna. The work as contemplated is intended to fur- 
nish a comprehensive index to the literature of scientific 
subjects. It will include periodicals as well as books,, 
and is meant to represent all the known literature that 
has appeared in any part of the world on technical or 
scientific topics. 

Dr. Murray, who is passing the letter D of the " New 
English Dictionary " through the press, states that 
American readers can render a great assistance by not- 
ing early instances of all the terms of American poli- 
tics, since this research is very difficult if undertaken 
in England. Examples of the use of such terms, duly 
authenticated by chapter and verse (author, edition,, 
volume, page), with date, should be forwarded to " Dr. 
Murray, Oxford, England," no other address being nec- 
essary. 

The 400th anniversary of Hans Sachs's birthday, Nov- 
ember 5, 1894, will be appropriately celebrated by the- 
University of the City of New York, a number of well- 
known university professors of German participating.. 
Professor A. S. Isaacs, of this university, has received 
permission from the author and publisher to translate 
into English Professor Max Koch's admirable " History 
of German Literature," issued a few months ago in Ger- 
many. The work has been very favorably noticed in. 
the press. 

Mr. W. D. Howells, in a recent interview, spoke as 
follows of the Spanish novelists : " The modern Spanish? 
school interests me keenly at present. There are many 
novelists of the first rank among them that ought to- 
be more widely read than they are. I may mention 
Perez Galdos his ' Dona Prefecta ' is excellent Juan- 
Valera, author of ' Pepita Jeminez ' ; Palacio Vald^s, 
and Emilia Pardo Bazan. In fact, these clever writers- 
of Spain easily outclass their French contemporaries, 
with the exception of Zola, ranking next, in my judg- 
ment, to those of Russia." 

A group of German and Swiss professors have issued 
a circular asking for subscriptions towards a Burger- 
monument. June 8, 1894, will be the hundredth an- 
niversary of the death of Gottfried August Burger, " the- 
great master of the popular German ballad literature.'^ 
It is suggested that the monument should be erected! 
over his grave in Gottingen. It was in Gottingen that 
the young student of theology was made a ballad-writer 
by the study of Bishop Percy's " Reliques," and here- 
he wrote his " Lenore." The grave is now marked only 
by a weatherbeaten column. Subscriptions will be re- 
ceived by the Dieterisch'sche Buchhandlung at Gottin- 
gen, the house which originally published Burger's 
poems. 

The London " Bookman " publishes monthly lists of 
the new books most in demand at the principal book- 
selling centres of the United Kingdom. These lists 
usually consist of six books each, named in the order of 
their popularity. In the lists for May we notice that 
Mr. Stead's book, " If Christ Came to Chicago," has the 
first place in the esteem of Middlesbrough readers, while 
Edinburgh holds it fourth, and Liverpool sixth. As 
for London, it is ranked fourth by the West End, and 
second by the East. Fashionable London, it seems, pre- 
fers The Yellow Book," Mr. Swinburne's " Astrophel,''"

and Mr. Brooke's " Tennyson." Manchester, Birming- 
ham, Glasgow, and Aberdeen will have none of it. 

The Loubat prizes of $1000 and $400 established 
at Columbia College by Joseph F. Loubat for the best 
works published in the English language upon the his- 
tory, geography, archaeology, ethnology, philology, or 
numismatics of North America have been awarded for 
1893 as follows: First prize to Mr. Henry Adams for 
his " History of the United States of America During 
the Administrations of Madison and Jefferson," in nine 
volumes ; second prize to Mr. A. F. Bandelier for his 
" Report of Investigations Among Indians of the South- 
western States," in two volumes. Mr. Adams has pre- 
sented to the College, for the purchase of books for the 
library, the sum awarded to him. 

A friendly correspondent calls our attention to the 
inadvertance whereby, in the last issue of THE DIAL, 
the late Madame Renan was spoken of as the daughter, 
instead of the niece, of the artist Scheffer, and to the 
more serious error of publishing the obituary of Herr 
von Sacher-Masoch before the Galician novelist had de- 
parted this life. Of this error, we can only say that we 
shared it with a large section of the American press. 
The statement was so generally published that we had 
no reason to doubt its accuracy. Like the report that 
Mr. Ruskin had been appointed Poet Laureate, it got into 
circulation no one knows how, and ran its course. We 
understand that Herr von Sacher-Masoch is still se- 
riously ill. 

The London " Bookman " has this tribute to the ver- 
satility of the late W. Robertson Smith : " His pub- 
lished works, high and varied as their importance is, 
give but a faint idea of the extraordinary man who wrote 
them. It was often said of him that he knew more 
than any other man alive. Music alone seemed to have 
no interest for him, except a scientific one. But of all 
the other arts, of all sciences, of all histories, literatures, 
and philosophies, his knowledge was amazing; no one 
knew the limits of it ; and his readiness in the command 
of it seemed almost superhuman. For hours, for a long 
day even, he could talk without weariness or dulness on 
subject after subject to his company's heart's content, and 
never be commonplace, never fail to stimulate and in- 
struct. His wealth of ideas was almost as marvellous as 
his wealth of knowledge ; his mind was far too restless to 
stay content even with the enormous collection of facts 
and of other men's opinions that he had at such com- 
mand." 

MR. WARNER ON CHARACTER DELINEATION IN FICTION. 

Mr. C. D. Warner, in " Harper's Monthly " for June, 
thus writes of character delineation in modern fiction: 

" It is true to say that modern fiction deals more with 
experience than with character. The novelist is more 
concerned with certain ideas or views of life, with his 
own experiences got too often at second hand from 
other novels than with the creation of characters in 
which life can be seen without his explanations. When 
we refer to certain great works of fiction we always 
think of their defined and vivid characters, which take 
their places in history as visible to our minds as any 
people who ever lived, whereas in most recent novels 
we find mostly an attempt to set forth ideas or a state 
of society, and in thinking of them we recall the study 
of motives, the sketch of traits, incidents of daily life, 
stopping short of adventure, and the more or less wide 
and knowing comments of the author. These are, to 
be sure, the raw materials of fiction, but until they are 



embodied in personality, in characters, they fail to cre- 
ate perfect illusion. The novelist who has not creative 
genius, or is too lazy to represent life in characters, some- 
times resorts to ear-marks, or names them by label or 
some trick or phrase or gait. But so little are the char- 
acters realized by the author or felt by the reader that 
the speech of one might be taken for that of another, 
and is not at all distinguished in page after page of 
level dialogue. To avoid this sameness of utterance, 
resort is had to dialect for so bad spelling and defect- 
ive grammar are often named. Play-writers have an 
advantage, for their characters are visibly represented, 
and can be distinguished by their voices and peculiar- 
ities of manner and dress, but they also often resort to 
the inartistic expedient of catchwords and repeated 
phrases. It is true that a given society of people use 
substantially the same language; that is, well-bred 
people speak in one way and illiterate people in an- 
other way. The great difficulty of the novelist is to 
distinguish by their speech persons using substantially 
the same language. But no two persons do con- 
verse in the same way; the distinctions between them 
may be fine, but they are always recognized, for they 
come out of the character, which is never repeated. 
This fine discrimination, in dialogue as well as in action, 
can never be attained by a writer until he dramatically 
realizes his character, and is then truthful to his con- 
ception. We talk a great deal about novels being true 
to life, but can we think of any novel that is true to the 
universal apprehension, and that has passed from gen- 
eration to generation, that does not owe its life to its 
vivid characters ? "

CORRECTING A MISTAKE. 



DO YOU know the difference between a mistake and a blunder ? When you lay down a good umbrella and 
take up a poor one, you make a mistake; but when you lay down a poor umbrella and take up a good one, 
you make a blunder. 

So in bicycles. When you buy a poorer bicycle than you ought to ride, you make a mistake; when you buy 
anything but the best you make a blunder. When you buy any bicycle without first seeing the '94 Warwick, you 
make a blundering mistake. 

The best time to correct a blundering mistake is before you make it ! Therefore get our Catalogue. Get it at 
once ! Don't leave the chair in which you are now sitting until you have written a postal asking for it. 

When it arrives, live on it for fifteen minutes. Examine the Table of Contents for the New Features of 
1894 the new sectional wood rims, New Patent Adjustable Handle-Bars, New Rear Brake, New Frame with 
bearings on the same level, New Chain Adjustment, etc., etc. 

Don't overlook the old Warwick virtue of Construction which has given these wheels the reputation of being 
" built on honor." This is a very important feature. So, too, are the Warwick dust-proof bearings, for they are 
the only ones in the world. 

When the fifteen minutes are up, if you do not decide to purchase a Warwick, no harm has been done. But 
why speak of the impossible ? If you study a Warwick Catalogue carefully fifteen minutes, you will buy no other 
make. 

Secure the Catalogue To-day.
