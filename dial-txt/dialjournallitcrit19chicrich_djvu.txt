etc. With 13 full-page Illustrations by AMY SAWYER. Crown 8vo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

"In its splendor of description, weirdness of imagery, its astonishing variety of detail, its dexterity of handling, and the clean, healthy love- 
story which blends with history and fantasy, the book without doubt is a creation distinct from previous tales. Maya, the Lady of the Heart, is 
an ideal character. . . . Interest is sustained throughout. Of illustrations there is a goodly number." Post (Chicago).

COLONEL NORTON. A Novel. 

By FLORENCE MONTGOMERY, author of "Misunderstood," 
" Thrown Together," etc. Crown 8vo, buckram, $1.50. 

" It is a history of the finding of a soul, which is only found through 
the passion of a great love or an overwhelming sorrow. But the story 
is more than this : it is an analysis of a character that had been re- 
pressed. Ruth Ashley is a delightful creature. It also shows the 
power of love to change and transform the nature of a man, self-centred, 
cold, critical. . . . It has nothing of the melodramatic in it, but is bright 
and interesting from beginning to end, and healthful in its every page." 
Advertiser (Boston). 

THE JEWEL OF YNYS GALON. 

Being a hitherto unprinted Chapter in the History of the Sea 
Rovers. By OWEN RHOSCOMYL. With 12 full-page Illus- 
trations by LANCELOT SPEED. 12mo, linen cloth, orna- 
mental, $1.25. 

" The tale is exceptionally well told ; the descriptive passages are 
strong and vivid without being over-elaborated ; and the recital of 
fights and adventures on soa and land is thrilling, without leading to 
any excess of horrors. The book is certainly a most attractive addition 
to fiction of adventure." The Beacon (Boston).

A PRIMER OF EVOLUTION. 

By EDWARD CLODD, author of " The Story of Creation," etc. 

Illustrated. 16mo, polished buckram, 75 cents. 

"Mr. Clodd . . . has in the present volume provided a summary of 
the doctrine of evolution in a form that commends itself for its breadth 
of reasoning, its exactitude in scientific detail, and the clearness and 
impress! veness in which the whole argument is set forth. ... It is not 
too much to say that no one can call himself even fairly well educated 
without having mastered the greater part of the information which Mr. 
Clodd so attractively presents." Beacon (Boston).

THE MATCHMAKER. 

By Mrs. L. B. WALFORD. Crown 8vo, buckram cloth, orna- 
mental, $1.50. 

" A new novel by the author of ' The Baby's Grandmother ' and ' Mr. 
Smith ' is always eagerly anticipated by those who enjoy a love-story 
told with a charming freshness of style, with a satirical yet good-natured 
treatment of human foibles, and with a vivid, witty, and animating use 
of that sentiment which 'makes the world go round.' . . . 'The Match- 
maker ' gives a piquant hint of the plot. It will be found one of the 
most delightful of its author's works." New York Tribune. 

DOREEN, the Story of a Singer. 

By EDNA LYALL, author of "We Two," " Donovan," etc. 

Crown 8vo, buckram cloth, ornamental, 512 pages, $1.50. 

"Edna Lyall's . . . new story ... is one of her best. It has, nat- 
urally, enough tragedy to make it intensely interesting without being 
sensational in any offensive sense. The heroine, Doreen, is a delightful 
character, sturdy, strong, lovable, womanly, and genuinely Irish. Miss 
Bayly is a conscientious writer, imbued with deep feeling, a high pur- 
pose, and her style is attractive and pure. " Boston Daily Advertiser.

CYCLING FOR HEALTH AND PLEASURE. 

An Indispensable Guide to the Successful Use of the Wheel. 

By LUTHER H. PORTER. With many Illustrations. Cloth, 

16mo, $1.00. 

" It tells the average, every-day cyclist the practical things that he 
wants to know, and tells it so plainly and simply that there is no mis- 
understanding. " Minneapolis Tribune. 

GOLF IN AMERICA. 

By JAMES P. LEE. With numerous Illustrations. Cloth, 

16mo, $1.00. 

" Mr. Lee writes on the subject from an intimate and practical knowl- 
edge of the game, and in describing how it is played, he avoids useless 
technicalities and adapts himself to the uninitiated." Buffalo Com- 
mercial. 

THE REAL CHINAMAN. 

By CHESTER HOLCOMBE, late Secretary U. S. Legation at 

Pekin. Illustrated. 8vo, $2.00. 

The Nation says : " This work is destined to take high rank in the 
army of books on China. It is calm, clear, and fair. It has those two 
qualities which are almost invariably lacking in the works of men who 
try to interpret the Chinese to us. ... The first is fairness. . . . What 
is still more remarkable ... it is positively interesting. We have read 
every word from the top of the title page to the bottom of the last 
chapter, and we have been led along as in a novel." 

THE IMPREGNABLE CITY. 

A Novel. By MAX PEMBERTON, author of " The Iron 
Pirate." $1.25. 

"Since reading that most improbable of stories, 'The Prisoner of 
Zeuda,' we have found none so deliciously improbable, yet so convinc- 
ing and realistic in its vigorous and rapid movement, its exciting ad- 
venture and thrilling tale of tender passion. ... It does not seem un- 
warrantable to predict that in a short time everybody will be reading 
'The Impregnable City.' " The Bookman. 

MELTING SNOWS. 

A Novel. Translated from the German by MARGARET 
SYMONDS. $1.25. 

" One of the most delightful of modern German stories. The awak- 
ening of love and its tragic ending is the theme. The author shows 
marvellous powers of soul analysis. There is nothing morbid in the 
book, though it is clearly shown that love costs. " Boston Advertiser. 

" A charming little German romance. . . . Purity of pathos marks 
the close, and, indeed, runs like a dark thread through all the story." 
Boston Traveller. 

LOVE AND QUIET LIFE. 

A Novel. By WALTER RAYMOND, author of " Young Sam 
and Sabina," etc. $1.25. 

"Perhaps the most beautiful book outside poetry published this 
year." RICHARD LE GALLIENNE. 

"Much that is pathetic, much that is grotesque laughter and tears 
jostle each other as in life." Athenaeum. 

"Refreshing in its freedom from the spectacular and the startling." 
Pioneer Press. 

"The rustic situations are as clever as they are often irresistibly 
amusing." -Literary Era. 

BESIDE THE BONNIE BRIER BUSH. 

By IAN MACLAREN. $1.25. 

For opinions of this book, ask your neighbors. Thousands 
have read and are reading it, and all echo the words of Dr. 
Nicoll, who "discovered" the author: "I know no living 
writer with a greater power of clutching the heart." 

KITTY ALONE. 

A Novel. By S. BARING-GOULD. Cloth, 12mo, $1.25. 
" As delightful and racy of the Cornwall soil as anything this versa- 
tile writer has done."

A REMARKABLE BOOK. ^^ Ready 

and Published by 

THE CENTURY CO. 

SONYA KOVALEVSKY 

Her Recollections of Childhood, translated from the Rus- 
sian by Isabel F. Hapgood; with a Biography by Anna 
Carlotta Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, translated from the 
Swedish. 8vo, 300 pages, frontispiece portrait, cloth, $1.75. 

This is the authorized American edition of a work which 
has excited great interest in Europe, comparable only to that 
awakened by the appearance of the memoirs of Marie Bash- 
kirtseff ; but while the latter was only a morbid, self-con- 
scious^ girl, S<5nya KpvaleVsky was a great genius, a mathe- 
matician crowned with honors by the leading universities. 
The book is an extremely interesting study to all who are 
interested in the possibilities of "the new woman." 

S6nya KovaleVsky reached her womanhood at a time when 
the young Russian women began to long for education. She 
became one of the most ardent in the new path, and, in order 
to be free to study in Berlin and Paris, she went so far as to 
ally herself to a young student in a fictitious marriage. This 
means a marriage in form only, recognized by every one ex- 
cept the contracting parties. Her husband did not understand 
her, and, to add to her miseries, S6nya fell in love with him ; 
after a time they became man and wife in earnest, but even 
the birth of a child could not straighten out the tangle into 
which they had got themselves by living a false life. The 
book is divided into two parts : Mme. KovaleVsky writes the 
story of her own childhood (a most delightful account of 
Russian family life), and to this is added a biography by her 
friend, the Duchess of Cajanello, who was also a striking ex- 
ample of the "new womanhood."

bra, etc. It is a delightful handbook and souvenir of Medi-

" Miss Barlow, especially when she deals with Ireland, is so delicate and a true painter of life. . . . The short stories are bright and perfect 
works of art. . . . Nothing can be more perfect in its way than the humor of those two stories. . . . Nor is there one of the tales in this little 
book that is characterized by the almost too profound melancholy of Miss Barlow's ' Irish Idyls.' Her new tales touch the happier side of Irish 
life. . . . The first story, 'Maureen's Fairing,' is exquisite. ' Stopped by Signall ' is a perfect gem, and will even add to Miss Barlow's well-merited 
though modest reputation for seeing both the fun and pathos of Irish character." The Spectator.

" ' Into the Highways and Hedges ' would have been a remarkable

S UMMER READING. 

There are many, doubtless, to whom the sug- 
gestion of a summer vacation largely devoted 
to reading, particularly if undertaken with 
profitable intent, will seem little better than a 
counsel of perfection. The strained nerves and 
the weary brain demand, they will urge, that 
whatever weeks or months may be annually 
snatched from the grasp of toil should be given 
up to recreation in its primitive sense, to the 
renewing of the exhausted vitality, to the re- 
building of the wasted tissue. At such times, 
the only books of which they will hear are 
those which the best authority tells us are to be 
found in running brooks, and the only sermons 
to which they are disposed to listen are the 
mute discourses of the stones upon sea-cliff or 
mountain-side. And there is undoubtedly a 
degree of tension, reached by many in our fever- 
ish latter-age life, from which relief is only 
possible upon condition of a complete, if tem- 
porary, abondonment of civilization with all its 
devices. We are impelled for a brief space 
to relapse into barbarism, and, seeking new 
strength by contact with the bare earth, to real- 
ize in our own experience the myth of Antaeus. 

But such relapses are not for long, and, the 
first joy of freedom and relaxation being at an 
end, the mental activities quickly reassert their 
need of occupation. The pendulum of life has 
soon swung all the way from the unendurable 
strain of daily recurrent labor to the equally 
unendurable ennui of prolonged idleness. The 
pure joy of existence may suffice for the mo- 
ment, but the sense of vacuity sets in after a 
while, and imperatively calls for some form of 
diversion that shall not leave Nature to do all 
the recreative work. At such times, more forci- 
bly perhaps than at any others, books offer us 
their serviceable solace, and we congratulate 
ourselves upon the instinctive foresight that 
led us to provide ourselves with such compan- 
ions. Then, reclining upon shaded lawn or 
veranda, upon deck or seashore, or pine-clad 
mountain slope, fortified against the intrusions 
of care, and at peace with all the world, we 
enjoy in equal measure the ministries of Na- 
ture and of Art, as far removed from ennui as 
from toil, and the discords of life are resolved 
into the richest of harmonies.

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



What books are best suited to the needs of 
the long summer days ? We have known a 
young man, in contemplation of an ocean voy- 
age, to take with him the " Kritik der Keinen 
Vernunft." Luckily there was a library on the 
ship, and Kant remained undisturbed at the 
bottom of the traveller's trunk. On the other 
hand, there are too many people whose idea 
of a summer's literary provision becomes em- 
bodied in a package of ephemeral novels of 
varying degrees of unreality or imbecility, and 
an armful of illustrated periodicals. We hardly 
know which of the two extremes thus illustrated 
deserves the severer censure, but if either case 
is to have our sympathies it must be that of the 
Kantian student rather than that of the "Dodo"- 
laden excursionist. The former, at least, has 
a rational motive, if his judgment be woefully 
at fault ; the latter is, however unconsciously, 
doing his best to waste a golden opportunity. 

The rational person will take neither Kant 
nor " Dodo " to his place of summer resort, for 
he will know that there is a grateful mean be- 
tween the substantial but not easily digestible 
quality of the one and the mere frothiness of 
the other. He will know, for one thing, that 
there is an abundance of literature which is of 
the very best, yet which makes no strenuous 
demand upon the faculties, which can hold the 
attention without conscious effort, so smooth is 
the flow and so harmonious the form. What 
reading, for example, could be more ideally 
fit for the long summer afternoons than the 
poetry of the " Faery Queene " or the " Earthly 
Paradise," the prose of the " Pentameron " or 
" Marius the Epicurean " ? Such reading as 
this becomes a permanent intellectual posses- 
sion, an influence moulding imagination and 
character, and the retrospective charm natu- 
rally attaching to the memory of a summer out- 
ing will be not a little enhanced by association 
with the imperishable beauty of such works of 
literary art. There is a passage in one of Fitz- 
Gerald's letters which embodies the whole gos- 
pel of summer reading. " I am now a good 
deal about," he says, " in a new Boat I have 
built, and thought (as Johnson took Cocker's 
Arithmetic with him on travel, because he 
shouldn't exhaust it) so I would take Dante 
and Homer with me, instead of Mudie's Books, 
which I read through directly. I took Dante 
by way of slow Digestion : not having looked 
at him for some years : but I am glad to find 
I relish him as much as ever : he atones with 
the Sea ; as you know does the Odyssey these 
are the Men ! " 



What shall we do, then, with what Mr. Rus- 
kin calls the good books of the hour telling 
us that " we ought to be entirely thankful for 
them, and entirely ashamed of ourselves if we 
make no good use of them " if we are not to 
put them in our trunk when we start upon our 
vacation ? We have no disposition to under- 
rate the usefulness of " these bright accounts 
of travels, good-humored and witty discussions 
of questions, lively or pathetic story-telling in 
the form of novel, firm fact-telling by the real 
agents concerned in the events of passing his- 
tory." But we think that the time for them 
is the hour left us after a hard day's work, or 
the occasional holiday, rather than the sum- 
mer's weeks or months of continuous rest. 
When that happy season comes round, we can 
put it to better uses, and, if we are going to 
do any reading at all, it surely offers the occa- 
sion of occasions for that close acquaintance 
with " the authors " that we can never hope to 
make during the ordinary routine of active life. 
If we are well-advised, we will leave the ephem- 
eral and scrappy literature of the day for the 
day which brings it forth, and not allow it to 
usurp our attention during the only part of 
the year when we are really free to enter upon 
enjoyment of our great heritage of Books in 
the higher and better sense. " Who would 
think of taking up the ' Faery Queene ' for a 
stopgap ? " while waiting for the sound of the 
dinner-bell, Lamb asks us. And, to point the 
obverse of the moral, let us in turn ask : Who 
would think, or who ought to think, of devot- 
ing the long summer days to books whose final 
cause is to supply us with stopgaps, and which, 
when put to other uses, are as much out of 
place as Spenser would be in the hungry half- 
hour preceding the evening repast ? 



THE HISTORICAL NOVEL. 

Dunlop's definition of fiction as " select and 
highly-colored history " contained within itself the 
germs of all the discussions that have arisen on the 
historical novel and the limits of history and fiction. 
While Huet, the first to write a treatise on the novel, 
described it as " a fiction of love adventures, written 
in prose, with artistic method, for the pleasure and 
instruction of the reader," thus ignoring the element 
of realism, a consensus of opinion on the modern 
novel would surely base its structure upon life. 
Fiction includes every narrative prose description 
of human life into which enters consciously the ele- 
ment of the imagination, narrative, as opposed to 
annalistic or dramatic ; prose, as a quite arbitrary

but very convenient exclusion of an exceptional spe- 
cies with which are associated a troublesome kinship 
of varieties. 

But history, too, treats life ; and, in the shape of 
biography, more or less in narrative form. And 
much of what passes for the standard history of the 
world contains a very large element of imagination. 
The once universal conception of history as properly 
confined to the rise and fall of governments and 
the deeds of rulers, gaye, to be sure, a ground of 
distinction in the nature of the events and char- 
acters treated ; the novel introducing personages 
not known to history, and treating war and pol- 
itics only incidentally. But ideas of history have 
changed since Huet's day, and we recognize that 
the records of the common people and their daily 
lives are as important for the guidance of posterity 
as the chronicles of kings. So that any record of 
human life, or of any product or activity of men, 
may fairly be said, in so far as it is true, to be his- 
tory. 

We cannot escape the entangling alliance by try- 
ing to draw a line between the present and the past. 
We now write contemporary history ; and the novel 
would be classified as historical, no matter how re- 
cently past were its data, if its subject-matter were 
on other grounds recognized as historical. " Wav- 
erley," the type and pioneer of the species, treated 
events only sixty years gone by. Antiquity is not 
a mark of the historical in fiction or elsewhere. 

It may be thought feasible to establish a distinc- 
tion on the basis of the intention of the writer. As 
Mr. Marion Crawford says : " It is doubtful whether 
any genuine historical novel has ever yet been 
written for the sake of the history it contains ; 
and a parallel proposition might be set up that no 
genuine history has been written for the sake of 
the romance or imagination it contains. But the 
latter proposition will directly be met with doubt, 
and in the former will be detected the assumed dif- 
ference between the theme of history and that of 
the novel. Possibly a distinction may be made by 
viewing the writer's intent upon the reader ; his aim 
in the case of the novel being to amuse and enter- 
tain (not excluding a suppressed but controlling 
willingness to elevate), and in the case of the his- 
tory, to impress and instruct, or, in the language 
of Mr. Crawford, to furnish in the first case " an 
intellectual artistic luxury," in the second " an in- 
tellectual lesson." In general, this distinction, 
though elusive and not profound, may prove ser- 
viceable. 

In the line of biography the two branches of lit- 
erature approach most closely, and it is difficult here 
to find any other distinguishing mark for the novel 
than that of the conscious introduction of the imag- 
ination. But as to the proportion of this element, 
I doubt whether anything definite can be said. 
However fantastic and improbable a narrative and 
descriptions may be, the original materials are all 
from life and nature: it is not possible to invent 
something out of nothing. On the other hand, the 



amount of fiction may be almost imponderable. 
More than one successful novel has been a faithful 
narrative of real events, with merely the names of 
persons and localities altered enough to escape a 
libel suit. Usually, of course, the author wanders 
over the broad intervening territory, combining 
pieces of real persons into a new individual, re- 
grouping real events, revising the decision of fate, 
substituting what he conceives to be more interest- 
ing motives for actual ones, most commonly, per- 
haps, imagining what he himself would have felt 
and done, or would have wished to feel and do, under 
circumstances in which he had observed others. But 
ever the tendency has been to restrain the vagaries 
of the imagination, and make the product more true 
to life more like biography. 

Whence, then, is the disposition to decry the his- 
torical novel ? Quite evidently, it seems to me, from 
a false conception of the function, or discourage- 
ment over the possible achievements, of history. It 
is due chiefly to this false conception that we were 
so long in learning that " the bygone ages of the 
world were actually filled with living men, not by 
protocols, state papers, and abstractions of men." 
It was discouragement over the possibility of any 
other result that led Goethe to say : " The times of 
the past are a book with seven seals ; and what we 
call the spirit of the times is at bottom the spirit of 
the writers, in which the times are reflected." But 
with the new conception of history which says, " I 
consider nothing human out of my sphere," every 
novel becomes a human document, in a measure 
historical. 

It is not true that " the historical novel occupies 
a position apart and separate from others." On 
the contrary, it merges by such imperceptible de- 
grees with other fields of the novel that in many 
cases no critical surveyor can stake it off. Some- 
tftnes, as in " A Tale of Two Cities," there are neither 
personages nor events which are to be met in or- 
dinary narrative history ; only the background, the 
atmosphere, the spirit of the time, are historical. 
Again, as in Erckmann-Chatrian's "Conscript of 
1813 " and " Waterloo," the events, many of them, 
are of world-wide importance, while the characters 
ae all to fame unknown. More commonly as in 
" Waverley," Hauff's " Lichtenstein," Freytag's 
" Marcus Konig," " Romola," or " Ben Hur," the 
time is partly fixed by events and surroundings, but 
more by some historical personage who towers like 
a mountain in the more or less remote background, 
while the actors who fill the foreground are as in the 
previous case obscure. Yet again, some or all of 
the leading characters, as well as some of the ele- 
ments of the plot, may be the property of familiar 
history ; such are " Kenilworth," " Hypatia," Ham- 
merling's " Aspasia," Dahn's " Ein Kampf urn 
Rom." 

It is with historical novels of this last type that 
critics are most apt to lose patience. If the ficti- 
tious events and persons introduced in connection 
with the familiar ones are of any significance we 



10

[July 1, 



are sure to get an impression of improbability. We 
ask, How does it come that we have never heard of 
these events and persons before ? Then the critical 
scent for anachronisms is aroused : we discover 
printed books in the tenth century, and lightning- 
rods in the seventeenth ; we find the furniture of 
classic Greece introduced into Christian Rome, and 
the instruments of Judea jangling in the halls of 
mediaeval Germany. As Mr. Crawford says : " So 
soon as a man deals with events that have actually 
taken place, he is bounded on all sides by a multi- 
tude of details with which he must be acquainted 
and from which he cannot escape." Plainly, the 
wisdom to be derived from this is that known per- 
sons and events are to be avoided by the novelist, 
or to be used only as background. But it does not 
at all follow that the historical novel is thereby con- 
demned. What is the harm in laying a story in 
proximity to some place, event, or person, whose 
presence gives a sense of assurance and confidence ? 
The principle is the reverse of that of a cyclorama, 
where a few logs and stones, an overturned cannon, 
and a stuffed and blood-stained uniform in the fore- 
ground, help out the perspective of the painting on 
the wall. Only, here the realistic touches make tol- 
erable some very indifferent fresco-painting ; while 
with the author the historical background enables 
him to concentrate his powers on other points. 

Everyone knows how much more interest a lis- 
tener takes in a story that is laid in a scene famil- ' 
iar to him. For this reason, professional story- 
tellers whose consciences permit always represent 
the events of their narratives as having happened 
in their presence, or at least as having been told 
them by one of the actual participants. Not wide- 
eyed childhood alone exclaims to Dame Saga : " Tu 
I'as vit, grand' mere ? " 

Finally, an especial challenge to the creative fac- 
ulty comes from the tomb. By as much as it is more* 
difficult to bring the dead back to life than to plant 
or beget for the coming race, by so much is the temp- 
tation greater to try to make, even in the imagina- 
tion, " dead things relive of long ago." But the task 
of making men of the past seem real is not by 
any means so difficult as that of making dead men 
live. In this respect the historical novel is subject 
to the same difficulties and limitations as the novel 
in general. 

The truth is that all of the antipodal differences 
of opinion in regard to the field, function, and pos- 
sibility of the historical novel are based upon two 
impressions or prejudices which underlie the critic's 
views of human nature. One of these assumptions 
is that men in all times and all climes are essen- 
tially alike ; the other, that each country as well 
as each age produces its distinct variety of man. 
It is this latter assumption which leads Mr. Howells 
to object to characters in an historical novel, be- 
cause "the people affect me like persons of our 
generation made up for the parts," and to assign 
the region of historical romance to " readers and 
writers who cannot bear to be brought face to face 



with human nature." Yet there is no more arguing 
over the matter than over optimism and pessimism. 
These tinctures are the result of a man's food, like 
the proportion of red corpuscles in his blood. As 
a rule, the cosmopolitan learns that men are about 
alike the world over ; while the provincial on his 
first visit to the metropolis of his own state fancies 
all men he sees to be selfish and cold, and feels him- 
self an alien among his countrymen. 

If we regard the men of the past as of like parts 
and passions with ourselves, we shall not take of- 
fense if we find in a picture of the past the " univer- 
sal human elements which are found in every time, 
the permanent in the transitory." If it is true, as 
Leslie Stephen declares, that Scott's novels are 
" rapidly converting themselves into mere debris of 
plaster of Paris," it must be that he put his " me- 
diaeval upholstery " too much in the foreground and 
drew too little from the human nature that he knew. 

The novel is a kind of history, as the common 
origin of " story " and "history" in itself hints; 
and such dicta as that of Palgrave, that historical 
novels are " the most harmful of all semi-poetic hy- 
brids, without profit for the artistic sense and ruin- 
ous to the historic sense," are based on obsolete pre- 
sumptions regarding history or inadequate estimates 
of the importance of the novel. There is no con- 
flict between the two forms of literature. In some 
respects they seek the same ends. If it be under- 
stood that the novel makes no pretension to accu- 
racy of date, document, details of diplomacy or 
events, but confines itself to life in general, to mak- 
ing the past seem real and the men of the past mem- 
bers of our common family, then it will fulfil one 
of the functions of history in which history most 
easily fails, while at the same time insisting upon 
all life, and not simply the life of the present, as its

FICTION -READING IN THE COUNTRY. 



Mr. Stevenson says that any reading fit to be called 
reading should be an absorbing and voluptuous process ; 
and he bemoans the fact that this engrossing interest 
passes away with the youth of the individual. Miss 
Repplier joins the wail, and extends the loss of ardor 
in reading from the individual to the age. She finds 
that even the children now fail to be carried out of 
themselves by romance and fairy tales. This satiety 
she attributes to the flooding of their minds with weak 
and supposedly harmless children's books, and she 
strongly advocates giving them such meat of literature 
as Marjorie Fleming fed upon. 

This change in the power of fiction may be true in 
regard to the people of the cities, whose lives are 
crowded with a variety of interests, and whose desire 
for change and new experience is constantly gratified. 
They live more in realities than in imagination, and 
ideal heroes seldom wield the mighty influence of a 
vital character whom the reader loves or hates. 

The case is far different in the country, however, 
where books are few, time is long, and distracting events

are rare. When a new book comes to a household the 
highest evidence of noble generosity consists in letting 
others have it first. Among the children, when this un- 
selfish spirit does not exist, the new story will cause un- 
limited dissension. Walter Scott was not the only boy 
whom the dinner-bell could not draw from his unfin- 
ished story. I know a set of volumes of Scott's own, 
calf-bound but tattered through much use, which have 
rendered a number of boys and girls, for the time of 
reading, unconscious of hunger, heat, or cold. Neither 
pangs of conscience for work neglected, nor anticipa- 
tions of coming reproof, could break or even mar the 
charm of the romance. 

It was a country girl who, having exhausted the oil 
in her lamp, and fearing she would be sent to bed if 
she sought another, finished her book by the flickering 
and interrupted light of a box of matches, lit one by 
one. Nor is it only boys and girls of whom this state 
of affairs is true; hard-working, white-haired men and 
women, if they read at all, do it with an intensity of in- 
terest amounting to intemperance. I once heard a prac- 
tical busy mother decline a book offered her by a neigh- 
bor, saying, " No, I must 'nt take it; I am as fond of 
my children as the next one, but novels almost make me 
hate them when they wont give me a chance to read." 

To lend one's books is held to be the most neighborly 
act of kindness, and not to do so an evidence of the 
most unforgivable meanness. The same books are usu- 
ally read by all the families of the community, and the 
characters and incidents in the story become a general 
conversational fund. They are not valued as a means 
for keeping the social ball rolling, but are of vital in- 
terest in themselves. The men and women of real life 
are measured by the characters in fiction ; and, indeed, 
theories of life are largely influenced by the fiction read 
in the neighborhood. 

Two young men in the neighborhood that I have in 
mind were ploughing in adjacent fields, and chanced to 
reach the end of their furrows at the same time, with 
only the fence between them. After the exchange of 
greetings, the hero of the novel last read became the 
subject of remark as naturally as the last man talked 
with would have been to men of the city stopping for 
a chat. Not minutes, but hours, these two young 
ploughmen sat on a rail fence talking over the good and 
the bad, the sad and the humorous elements of the 
book. The characters and episodes existed in their 
imagination with all the reality of actual life. When 
they returned to their work they made up for their 
neglect by trudging many a weary mile after the usual 
hour for stopping came, but they did not consider that 
time lost which was spent in fellowship with their ficti- 
tious friends. 

A writer may be read by city people because it is the 
thing to do, or for critical purposes ; but country read- 
ers are his real test of power to move the human heart. 
They have no motive for reading other than interest, 
and no standard of criticism besides individual taste. 
They are generous in their liking, and frank in declar- 
ing a book worthless or vicious, regardless as to whether 
the author's name is well known or not. 

Undoubtedly, the indebtedness of country people to 
fiction for supplying needed variety and excitement to 
minds otherwise satiated with uneventful monotony, is 
very great; but that of the author is fully as great to 
the people who give his creations the most ardent re- 
ception. It is in the country that Dickens calls forth 
the most spontaneous laughter and tears, that Scott 



arouses thrills of enthusiasm for chivalry and adven- 
ture, that George Eliot's most earnest teaching finds its 
deepest influence, that Kipling and Stevenson meet the 
most genuine wonder, and that Howells's portraits of 
human nature are the most absorbing studies. 

FANNY BATES. 



JAMES DYKES CAMPBELL. 



James Dykes Campbell, born November 2, 1838, 
died at Tunbridge Wells on the first of June, 1895. To 
the general reader, his name means little; but to the 
student of English literature he was known as the first 
of authorities on Coleridge, as well as on the whole 
period of which that poet was a chief ornament. His 
" Life of Coleridge " is so much the best biography of 
its subject that all others count for nothing in the com- 
parison. The same high praise must be given to his 
annotated edition of the " Poems." We select a few 
passages from the tributes evoked by his death. Mr. 
Arthur Symons writes : " Few men so widely and so 
profoundly gifted have ever subordinated themselves so 
completely to the most thankless of literary duties, and 
to the helpfulness of a disinterested literary conscience. 
Never professing to be a scholar, he gave his life to the 
drudgery of a minute, and for the most part unrecog- 
nized, literary scholarship. He desired no fame, sought 
for no rewards, allowed himself no privileges but the 
passionate satisfaction of an absolute exactitude. Peo- 
ple who wrote books on any of the subjects in which he 
took especial interest came to him with their proof- 
sheets, and he re-wrote their books for them. No name 
is so frequently referred to with gratitude at the end 
of prefaces, but few are aware how much is meant by 
these acknowledgements of help received. He was 
Quixotic in his disinterestedness; and as truly as it may 
be said that he devoted his life to an ideal of scholar- 
ship, so truly may it be said that he devoted his life to 
an ideal of friendship." 

Canon Ainger has this to say of the "Life": "It is 
but little to say that it is t"he best life of Coleridge yet 
written. It is far more than this. It aimed for the 
first time at estimating a character of extraordinary 
complexity, of exceptional strength and exceptional 
weakness, with its high ambitions and its piteous fail- 
ures a task that might well baffle the profoundest stu- 
dent of hnman nature. His treatment of his subject 
formed no doubtful clue to the native goodness of heart 
and generosity of Dykes Campbell. The plea for a 
kindly judgment of the character of Coleridge, as 
summed up in the final words of the biography, is not 
only one of the most eloquent and pathetic pieces of 
criticism given to the world in our generation, but will 
live in the hearts of all who knew the writer as a sure* 
index of the gentle and truth-loving nature that has 
been so early removed from among them." 

And Sir Walter Besant makes these observations 
about the quality of his work: " Never was a book writ- 
ten which afforded the writer greater pleasure. For the 
production of such books we want more such men. 
There is no money to be got from them. Their com- 
mercial value is little indeed compared with the time, 
and the labor, and the cost of producing them. Few 
men, therefore, can afford to engage upon such books. 
But the reward is great to those who can and will afford 
the unpaid labor."

A CONGRESSMAN'S RECOLLECTIONS OF 
WAR TIMES.* 



The close of our Civil War has been fol- 
lowed by a dispensation of political and mili- 
tary reminiscences. These have been abun- 
dantly served up in biographies and autobiog- 
raphies, in magazines and newspapers, and in 
popular lectures. Ex-Congressman Riddle, in 
the preface to his volume of " Recollections of 
War Times," says : " The war its policies, 
incidents, and men its struggles, sufferings, 
and losses its horrors, adventures, and tri- 
umphs has been written up, dwelt upon, dis- 
cussed, and talked over, in public and private, 
till he is a brave or a reckless man who ven- 
tures now to challenge public attention to any- 
thing further he may have to offer on that 
topic." He thinks, however, that a history of 
the Thirty - seventh and Thirty -[eighth Con- 
gresses and their legislation, especially of the 
Thirty-seventh, is called for ; and says " he has 
long meditated something like a memoir, which 
he finally submits, not without misgiving." 

Mr. Riddle has not overstated the difficul- 
ties of his task, and his complete success in 
performing it would evidently have been a sur- 
prise to himself. As a history, his work lacks 
unity and coherence. It is too scrappy and 
miscellaneous. Of the forty -seven chapters 
into which his three hundred and forty-three 
pages are divided, several might properly have 
been omitted as trivial or unimportant. Others 
deal with matters which scarcely belong to the 
story of the war, such as the detailed account, 
given in Chapter Fifteen, of two contested elec- 
tion cases, including copious extracts from the 
speeches of members upon legal points of no 
present interest ; and Chapter Twenty-nine, in 
which the subject of ship canals is introduced, 
and a clever speech of Mr. Riddle on the sub- 
ject, which he had leave to print, is given in 
full. 

In dealing with military affairs he correctly 
states the strength and disposition of our forces 
at different times during the war, and shows 
himself to have been an interested student of 
army movements. He deals with the financial 
policy of the government more fully, giving 
liberal extracts from the debates in Congress 
on the subject, including a speech of his own,

and Events in Washington, 1860-1865. By Albert Gallatin

which does him credit, at a time when so many 
of his Congressional associates were lost in the 
fog. This subject, however, has been far more 
fully dealt with in other publications, and no 
new views are given. Mr. Riddle quotes from 
the debates in the House in January and Feb- 
ruary, 1862, on the slavery question, and a very 
radical speech of his own is given, on a propo- 
sition offered by Mr. Lovejoy for the prohibi- 
tion of slavery in all places within the juris- 
diction of the national government. A little 
later, the bill for the abolition of slavery in the 
District of Columbia gave rise to a more gen- 
eral and thorough discussion of the question 
in both houses, and Mr. Riddle gives copious 
extracts from the debates in the Senate and 
his own speech on the question when the bill 
reached the House. But the whole subject has 
received such manifold treatment in our anti- 
slavery literature since the war that his frag- 
mentary chapters relating to it can scarcely be 
regarded as responsive to any popular demand. 
The real interest of the book will be found 
in its personal reminiscences. It abounds in 
incidents, and these are set forth with anima- 
tion. Mr. Riddle sees vividly, and he knows 
how to depict what he sees. His description 
of Washington before the war is singularly 
graphic, and will be especially entertaining to 
those who are familiar with the beautiful and 
queenly city of to-day. 

" It was then as unattractive, straggling, sodden a 
town, wandering iip and down the left bank of the 
yellow Potomac, as the fancy can sketch. Pennsylvania 
avenue, twelve rods wide, stretched drearily over the 
mile between the unfinished Capitol and the unfinished 
Treasury building on Fifteenth street, west, where it 
turned north for a square, and took its melancholy way 
to Georgetown, across the really once very beautiful 
Rock Creek. Illy paved with cobblestones, it was the 
only paved street of the town. The other streets, which 
were long stretches of mud or deserts of dust and sand, 
with here and there clumps of poorly built residences 
with long gaps between them, passing little deserts of 
open lands, where their lines were lost, wandered from 
the highlands north towards the Potomac, and from the 
eastern branch (Anacosta) to Rock Creek. Not a sewer 
blessed the town, nor off of Pennsylvania avenue was 
there a paved gutter. Each house had an open drain 
from its rear out across the sidewalk. As may be sup- 
posed, the capital of the Republic had more mal-odors 
than the poet Coleridge ascribed to ancient Cologne. 
There was then the open canal, or branch of the Chesa- 
peake and Ohio, from Rock Creek to Anacosta, breed- 
ing malaria, tadpoles, and mosquitoes. The Tiber of 
to-day, ancient ' Goose Creek,' stagnated from the high- 
lauds, through the Botanic Gardens, and Slush Run 
overflowed the northwest wastes of the swampy city 
plat." 

Mr. Riddle gives a vivid account of his ex-

perience at the first battle of Bull Run, which 
he visited with several other civilians, and of 
the panic which took complete possession of 
our troops. In a letter to his wife he gave a 
free off-hand sketch of the affair as it came 
within his personal observation ; and this let- 
ter, falling into the hands of his political ene- 
mies, had the effect of suddenly bringing to an 
end his Congressional career. It was badly 
garbled and misrepresented, and afterwards 
became so complicated with the patronage of 
the district and the malignity of his foes that 
his friends thought his life was in danger. He 
was burned in effigy, and the popular madness 
became quite irresistible. He quietly accepted 
the inevitable, but kept up his active interest 
in public affairs during the war, while resum- 
ing his professional labors. Referring to his 
retirement, in the thirty-first chapter, Mr. Rid- 
dle gives this estimate of Congressional life : 

" I had at least escaped the personal injury of long 
service in the House. No man has ever served through 
three Congresses and returned healthfully to take up 
his old life and pursuits. No matter how innocent and 
regular may be a man's life and habits in Washington, 
his mind does not escape the kind of dissipation that 
in a way unfits it for the ordinary pursuits of life. If 
his career has been passably successful, he has a scrap- 
book filled with newspaper laudations and criticism, 
twenty or forty volumes of the Globe, innumerable pub- 
lic documents, and a general disgust and unfitness for 
ordinary useful avocation. His profession is gone, his 
wife is dwarfed by years of neglect, his children are 
strangers, and he comes to loathe the " Honorable " 
that men prefix to his name, the only emolument he 
has acquired save personal and political animosities and 
alienated friends." 

This is one side only, and the dark side, of 
the picture. Legislative experience can only 
be had by a continuous service, and the exam- 
ple of such men as John Quincy Adams and 
Joshua R. Giddings shows that political fame 
and great public usefulness are sometimes its 
ripe fruit. It also sometimes happens that a 
man's professional life is successfully resumed 
after an honorable service in Congress. This 
must depend upon the man himself ; nor is there 
any necessity for neglecting his wife or making 
strangers of his children. If these things hap- 
pen it is not the long service but the moral 
qualities of the official which account for them. 
Mr. Riddle's view is too doleful. Our national 
legislation affords opportunities for great use- 
fulness and honor, and the patriotic ardor of 
our young men should be animated by courage 
and faith rather than chilled by despair. Even 
the interests of home and family are sometimes 
to be subordinated to the paramount claims of 
the State. 



Among the best things in Mr. Riddle's book 
is his picture of McClellan on his first arrival 
in Washington and in the day of his glory. 

" McClellan's coming to the capital was like the ad- 
vent of a beneficent prince. We awoke one morning to 
find the streets, the city, serenely free of the wander- 
ing gangs of brass and blue. They had all disappeared 
in a night. In his presence order and quietude at once 
found themselves everywhere established. As by a 
potent magic, obedience, discipline, neatness, and the 
air military, ruled the camps to which the soldiers were 
confined ; the awkward citizen began to assume the 
bearing of a soldier, preparing to take his place in the 
finely wrought mechanism of the company, regiment, 
brigade, division, and army corps. Never had we a 
superior organizer, with the skill to turn out the com- 
pleted regiment. Had his enterprise, his dash, his elan, 
and his tactics in the field, equalled his art as a con- 
structor and artificer of soldiers, his genius would have 
approached some of the renowned commanders of his- 
tory. Coming as he did to the President's aid to relieve 
him of the chaos of his capital, no wonder he won his 
heart and confidence. Simple and modest then, he 
adopted no style, no full dress, plumes, and bullion, no 
glittering staff and parade at the first not even a 
shoulder-strap. We saw him on the avenue, a simple 
soldier, without any mark or insignia alone, hurrying 
on, few knowing his person." 

Mr. Riddle is not less graphic in other per- 
sonal descriptions. In referring to Thaddeus 
Stevens, he says : 

" Stevens was not an economist, and by temper not a 
leader, but a driver bitter, quick as electricity, with 
a sarcastic, blasting wit. He most frequently answered 
an honest inquirer for information with a dash of vit- 
riol in the face. Short as he stood, with his large head 
covered with a long-haired wig; broad-shouldered, he 
usually was standing when he discharged his burning, 
gall-tipped shafts, which he jerked out in an unpleasant 
voice, and immediately limped off on his short, club- 
footed leg." 

Mr. Riddle was warmly attached to Lincoln, 
though he sometimes criticised his policy, as did 
a large majority of members of both Houses. 
In speaking of his first inaugural address, he 
says : 

" Never was there a more persuasive speaker. His 
quaint logic, and taking, unaccustomed ways, were ab- 
solutely irresistible. His vocabulary was limited; he 
used mainly the simple words one learns in childhood, 
which are always the most serviceable, and which ar- 
range themselves easily, delivering their burden of 
thought with certainty and force to the minds to which 
they are addressed. Perhaps there was never a more 
immediately effective address delivered to men than this 
quaint, masterly performance, an impression only deep- 
ened by after-study and reflection. It was in many 
respects the greatest service to his country of any single 
labor of Mr. Lincoln's. As a forensic effort it was as 
effective as that delivered at the Gettysburg that was 
to be." 

In referring to the question of Reconstruc- 
tion, our author says : 

" So entirely had Mr. Lincoln won the heart and soul 



14

of the masses, that the common mind accepted his de- 
cision as right in all cases, beyond criticism or cavil. 
One of the gravest of all the problems springing from 
secession was the reconstruction of the Republic. Un- 
questionably the President was wrong both as to the 
depository of the power and the best method of recon- 
struction. Yet we have seen that the people stood as 
one with him, and denounced the before-ever-trusted 
Wade; Ohio repudiated him, and the brilliant Winter 
Davis had to leave Congress. What would have been 
the result had Lincoln lived ? " 

Mr. Riddle speaks kindly of the old anti- 
slavery leaders, with the single exception of 
Charles Sumner ; and his inexcusable fling at 
him can harm nobody but Mr. Riddle himself. 
He also does injustice to Sumner in according 
to Seward the great honor of averting the peril 
of a war with England in the Trent affair, 
when the fact is that Seward blundered, and 
Sumner came to the rescue by placing the sur- 
render of Mason and Slidell on the only ground 
which could have pacified England. 

Mr. Riddle's admiration for Secretary Stan- 
ton was absolutely unbounded, and perhaps the 
finest thing in the book is his address before 
the Washington Bar, on the 3d of January, 
1870, in commemoration of Stanton's death, 
which is printed in the Appendix. The tribute 
is as beautiful as it is just.

PRESENTMENTS OF DEFOE.* 

The interest in the personality of the author 
of " Robinson Crusoe " seems to be perennial ; 
and it culminates periodically in a new biogra- 
phy. It is one hundred and sixty-four years 
since Daniel Defoe uttered his last devout Te 
Deum laudamus and was laid to rest in his 
native parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate ; and 
since that time some six lives of him have ap- 
peared. The first of his biographers was the 
Scottish antiquary, George Chalmers, whose 
"Life of Defoe" was published in 1786. 
Walter Wilson's Life " (1830) was thorough 
and painstaking, and had the distinction of 
being enriched with prolegomena by Charles 
Lamb. William Chadwick's " Life " (1859) 
may fairly rank, as a curiosity of literature,

with Piazzi Smyth's mysticism about the Great 
Pyramid, or Mr. Donnelly's cryptogramic ex- 
posure of the impostor Shakespeare. In 1869, 
the recent discovery of six letters of Defoe in 
the State Paper Office was the occasion of Wil- 
liam Lee's elaborate three-volume work, " The 
Life and Newly Discovered Writings of Daniel 
Defoe." In 1879, Mr. William Minto con- 
tributed to the " English Men of Letters " 
series a compact and well-proportioned memoir 
of Defoe. And now comes Mr. Thomas Wrisrht, 

O * 

the principal of the Cowper School at Olney, 
and offers, in the substantial octavo before us, 
a new " Life of Daniel Defoe." 

The raison c?' etre of the book may be found, 
first, in the author's belief that "with the person- 
ality of no eminent man of letters of the seven- 
teenth and eighteenth centuries is the public 
less familiar than with that of Daniel Defoe "; 
second, in his desire " to paint the man Daniel 
Defoe "; third, in his theory that " Robinson 
Crusoe " was in all respects a carefully-worked- 
out allegory of Defoe's own life ; fourth, in his 
wish to bring out the fact that " Defoe was 
above all things that it was his endeavor to 
be above all things the man of God." To 
establish these theses, and at the same time to 
write an unwarped and straightforward biog- 
raphy of his hero, was certainly a task which 
made complex demands on the controversial 
and narrative powers of the writer. 

We cannot say that Mr. Wright has alto- 
gether happily discharged what has evidently 
been to him a labor of love. The mystery 
which Daniel Defoe liked to throw around his 
private life has baffled the acutest and most 
patient of his biographers ; and will not yield 
to persistence at this late day. The parallel- 
ism between Defoe and Crusoe may be conceded 
to this extent : that Defoe, like his hero, lived 
for many years alone in his island, led " a life 
of wonders, in continual storms, fought with 
the worst kind of savages and man-eaters, by 
unaccountable surprizing incidents ; fed by 
miracles greater than that of ravens ; suffered 
all manner of violences and oppressions, in- 
jurious reproaches, contempt by men, attacks 
of devils, corrections from heaven, and opposi- 
tions on earth." His long life of more than 
seventy years was passed in a whirl of contro- 
versy, denunciation of abuses, advocacy of re- 
forms far in advance of his generation, social 
and religious advice to parents, children, and 
servants ; and all the time, like a true journal- 
ist, he kept his private life perdu. He had no 
Boswell, nor even a Friday, to share his hopes

and opinions. From his own family he seems to 
have held himself often aloof: in all his volumi- 
nous writings there is scarce a reference to his 
brothers or his wife. It was not to be expected 
that much new light could be thrown on such 
a life as this ; and Mr. Wright has hardly ful- 
filled the large promise of his preface. The 
business failures of Defoe, his frequent disap- 
pearances and reappearances, the publicity of 
the pillory, and the seclusion of Newgate, are 
all scrutinized with eager care ; but the net 
result is disappointing. 

Mr. Wright's style leaves much to be de- 
sired. In his preface, he airily characterizes 
the works of his predecessors Chalmers, Wil- 
son, Chadwick, and Lee as " valuable works, 
all of them, but as dry as the very Sahara." 
With a laudable desire to avoid this aridity for 
his book, he has plentifully ornamented his 
pages with strange and uncanny flowers of 
speech, and evinces an almost nervous fear of 
seeming dignified or serious, which is very vex- 
atious to judicious readers. De Quincey loved 
to masquerade in slang, and defaced with it 
his best critical work ; and Mr. Wright should 
have taken warning from so conspicuous an 
example. Much was forgiven to the Opium- 
eater, for various reasons, a lenity which other 
writers can hardly claim. Nobody but a pro- 
fessed humorist could expect indulgence for 
such colloquialisms as " the inquirer finds him- 
self in clover " (p. 3), " a rare tussle " (p. 12), 
u would puzzle a Dutchman " (p. 38), " what 
on earth use " (p. 85), " that in all conscience 
was delicious enough, but now comes the coat- 
ing of almonds" (p. 133), "while they were 
swearing blue murder, he was either as cool as 
a cucumber or as merry as a grig " (p. 226), 
" riled them " (ibid.). It is not thus that per- 
manent literature is made. The types have 
gone wrong on pages 42, 79, 149, 188, 254 ; 
and there are one or two oddities like " vitu- 
perised " (p. 227). The book is handsomely 
printed and fully illustrated. All the famous 
portraits of Defoe are reproduced ; and the im- 
agination is stirred by f ac-simile reprints of the 
frontispiece and title-page of the first editions 
of " Robinson Crusoe," " Roxana," and " Jack 
Sheppard." There is an appropriate dedica- 
tion to Mr. Aitken, a series of four appendices, 
a complete chronological list of the 254 writ- 
ings of Defoe given by Mr. Lee (with two alter- 
ations), and a good index. On the whole, Mr. 
Wright has given us an entertaining narrative, 
and established one or two new facts ; but his 
book, with its hobbies and its strained air of 



vivacity, will scarcely displace the more digni- 
fied work of Mr. Lee or the memoir by Mr. 
Minto. Defoe, to our mind, remains very much 
of a riddle. The estimates of his character 
have ranged all the way from calling him an 
arch-liar and the prince of spies and turn-coats, 
to Mr. Wright's " the man of God." We turn 
away perplexed, and can only be sure that in 
him the elements were mixed. Yet, like that 
other noble nature, he was, we believe, " a man 
more sinn'd against than sinning "; and if we 
must formulate a sentence, we will fall back 
on Macaulay's summing-up of the great Tory 
Doctor, who was, like Defoe, buffeted by for- 
tune for many busy, weary years ; and will pro- 
nounce him " both a great and a good man." 
Dr. Johnson probably considered Defoe the 
man a " sad dog of a Whig "; but for the author 
of " The Life and Strange Surprizing Adven- 
tures of Robinson Crusoe " he reserved his 
choicest praise, bracketing that classic with 
" The Pilgrim's Progress " and " Don Quixote " 
as the only three books which their readers 
would wish longer. Generations of children 
of all ages have confessed its unique charm, 
have struggled through the surf with the hero, 
have peered horror-stricken over his shoulders 
at the gleaming eyes in the cave, and have 
shared that thrill which ran up and down his 
spine when " it happened one day, about noon, 
going towards my boat, I was exceedingly sur- 
prized with the print of a man's naked foot on 
the shore, which was very plain to be seen in 
the sand." Mr. George A. Aitken has long 
been known as a close and sympathetic student 
of Defoe ; and his name as the editor of a new 
edition of the " Romances and Narratives " will 
command popular interest in advance. Of the 
sixteen volumes that will comprise the series, 
the first three are given to the Crusoe tales, 
" Adventures," " Farther Adventures," and 
" Serious Reflections." Of these it may be said 
that the " Farther Adventures " and the " Seri- 
ous Reflections" fairly deserve the neglect which 
they share with the later cantos of " The Faerie 
Queene." When Crusoe's island was peopled, 
the charm was broken ; and after drawing the 
inevitable long breath, we begin to yawn and 
turn the pages listlessly. We are fascinated by 
the isolation, the make-shifts, the homely de- 
tail, even the iteration and amorphous style of 
the autobiographic hermit ; but we are only 
bored when the curtain falls on his loneliness, 
and rises on commonplace dealings with other 
men and women. But Mr. Aitken has, of course, 
felt the necessity of giving his author in com-

plete form ; and we must admire the dainty 
setting which he and his publishers have given 
to the classic. The little volumes are exquis- 
itely printed and bound, and chastely, though 
not lavishly, illustrated by Mr. Yeats. The 
frontispiece of the first volume is an etched re- 
production of the " looking-over-shoulder " por- 
trait of Defoe, prefixed to the first edition of 
"The True-born Englishman." An attractive 
feature is the printing of Defoe's coat-of-arms, 
with its motto "Laudatur et alget" on the sec- 
ond page of the cover, to serve as a book-plate 
for the purchaser. Mr. Aitken contributes an 
admirable general introduction, which in our 
judgment is simply the most satisfactory short 
memoir of Defoe that we have seen : it neither 
shirks, excuses, nor abuses. 

The American Book Company is doing a 
good educational work in its " Eclectic English 
Classics " series ; and in selecting " The His- 
tory of the Plague " to represent Defoe, it has 
made an excellent choice. Of all the prolific 
Daniel's two hundred and fifty-odd works, none 
better exhibits his most striking features of 
style. The minute detail, the irresistible veri- 
similitude, the awful realism, are all there, and 
almost persuade us that he saw all that he de- 
scribes, in spite of our knowledge that he was 
a boy though a precocious one of five, when 
the pestilence was raging. The introductory 
sketch is so distinctly unfavorable in its esti- 
mate of Defoe's character and literary merit, 
as to give pupils a very incorrect idea of his 
rank in literature. If he was only the shrewd, 
unscrupulous journalist that this editor makes 
him out, it is difficult to see how a place could 
be found for him in the " Eclectic English 
Classics." The introduction is well written, 
but seriously prejudices the reception of the 
masterpiece which follows it.

birds ? can at last be answered with entire satis- 
faction. Hitherto, no one work could be named 
which would furnish the inquirer adequate in- 
formation in just the form desired. The ornith- 
ologies extant were too costly and bulky, or too 
limited or local in scope, to suit the popular 
need. Now, in response, it would appear, to 
a general demand, several treatises are simul- 
taneously produced which answer every require- 
ment of the beginner, either one serving as a 
complete and convenient guide to an introduc- 
tory acquaintance with our native birds. At 
their head, the " Handbook of the Birds of 
Eastern North America," by Mr. Frank M. 
Chapman, must be placed without reserve. It 
is a model work of its kind. In size, cost, and 
contents, it gives equal satisfaction. A very 
large amount of matter is packed into the mi- 
nutest compass. Not a word is wasted ; and, 
we might add, not a fact is omitted not an 
essential fact, at least, so carefully selected and 
condensed is the information afforded. The 
work begins with a few preliminary chapters 
in which the student is instructed in the proper 
methods of out-door observation and of collect- 
ing and preserving birds and nests and eggs. 
In the course of these directions much impor- 
tant and fresh knowledge is conveyed concern- 
ing the general habits of birds, their migrations, 
their economic value in relation to agriculture, 
their special nesting time, and their summer 
and winter haunts in varied localities. An 
original system of classification is next pro- 
vided, by which the novice may readily identify 
any bird in the fauna east of the Rocky moun- 
tains. The body of the book is given to brief 
biographies of the birds, including over five 
hundred, arranged in their respective orders 
and families. Here, as elsewhere, there is the 
utmost condensation consistent with clear and 
comprehensive description. Often the resources 
of Mr. Chapman's own richly-stocked note- 
books are drawn upon, and often he takes from 
the stores of other competent observers the ma- 
terial for a vivid and authentic portrait. Noth- 
ing has been neglected in the structure of the 
work, and one can but applaud the masterly 
manner in which its scheme has been carried 
out. The series of plates and of figures inter- 
spersed through the text are of the highest 
artistic excellence, adding that touch of grace, 
that gleam of intelligence, which good illustra- 
tions always afford. 

Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright merits much 
praise for her generous efforts to excite an in- 
terest in the charming creatures privileged to

spend their lives just under the skies. A sec- 
ond volume from her hand, under the pretty 
title of " Birdcraft," follows quite in the line 
of Mr. Chapman's " Handbook," but with less 
claim in its contents to scientific method and 
fulness of accurate detail. Mrs. Wright writes 
more as an amateur, yet with a winning en- 
thusiasm and an impressive knowledge resting 
properly upon personal observation. She makes 
the most of a residence in an extensive garden 
which offers enticing haunts for a great variety 
of birds. With these continually under her 
eye, she has special advantages for original 
and gratifying studies. Think of twenty pairs 
of house wrens making their home round about 
one's dwelling in a single season ; and four 
pairs of red-eyed vireos with a corresponding 
multitude of delightful songsters to keep them 
company ! What a chorus of bird-music must 
roll out from every green nook and canopy ; 
what flashing of bird wings of every tinge of 
color ; and what revelations of delightful bird- 
mysteries must continually appeal to the intel- 
ligent observer ! It is well that in such a bird 
paradise a bird-lover has the good fortune to 
abide. In Mrs. Wright's book there is a sim- 
ple key to the birds, based upon their color, 
which will afford excellent help to the begin- 
ner in the identification of any male specimen 
in spring plumage. There are also colored 
plates of one hundred and twenty-eight of our 
common species. It is not to be expected that 
these should be perfect in tint, but they give a 
fair idea of the distinctive markings of each 
bird, and serve a better purpose than figures 
in pure black and white. The author's attempts 
at rendering the songs of birds in the English 
vernacular is necessarily a failure. The birds 
may speak to us in a language we can perfectly 
understand, but no one of us can act as an in- 
terpreter for another. To each sympathetic ear 
their voices address a distinctive word that 
harmonizes with the mood and temperament. 
It will mean the same to no two persons. To 
reduce any bird-song to human speech is piti- 
lessly to vulgarize it. " Songs without Words " 
appeal to the imagination, and suggest thoughts 
boundless as infinity. In the brief sketch 
given to each of two hundred separate species, 
Mrs. Wright has often a pleasing anecdote or 
comment to insert, which conies directly from 
her experience, and adds a new and valuable 
item to our accumulations in birdcraft. 

A welcome accession to the library of the 
ornithologist is the volume entitled " The Birds' 
Calendar," by Mr. H. E. Parkhurst. It is a 



detailed account of the author's study of wild 
bird-life during a single year, that of 1893. 
The field chosen for his investigations was lim- 
ited almost exclusively to " The Ramble" in Cen- 
tral Park, New York, a space covering about 
one-sixteenth of a square mile only, and includ- 
ing, with its bit of water, very little variety in 
the surface of the bush and wooded land. But 
within this restricted area, in the fragments of 
leisure left from more serious occupations, the 
observer was able to catch glimpses, and in some 
cases to make a considerable examination of the 
habits and characteristics, of over ninety differ- 
ent species of birds, in the course of the twelve- 
month. Beginning with January, the sterner 
period of the winter, Mr. Parkhurst made 
frequent visits to the woods and by-paths of 
" The Ramble," searching with keen and cau- 
tious movement for any flitting thing in feathers 
that might come within range of sound or sight. 
It was apparently the pastime of an amateur, 
but pursued in the true naturalist's spirit, with 
diligent and patient exactitude. His aim was 
to collect facts and facts only, as many and se- 
lect as possible, and, noting them down without 
embellishment, to connect and interpret them 
clearly and intelligently. His narrative is ex- 
panded by additional matter gleaned from au- 
thoritative sources, and the result is a really 
fresh and useful contribution to the literature 
of American ornithology. The book will sur- 
prise many a reader by showing how much in- 
terest and animation birds lend to nature in 
even the baldest and dreariest season of the 
year. By its chronological order it performs 
an equal service in helping one to associate 
the various phenomena of bird life, migration, 
song, nesting, molting, and so on, with the un- 
folding panorama of the seasons. Though most 
painstaking and careful in his work, Mr. Park- 
hurst has left a few trifling errors for future 
correction. There are three warblers, he will 
find, instead of one, which are to be met with 
during winter in our Northern States. The 
house wren, contrary to his statement on page 
158, is fully entitled to its familiar name, be- 
ing strongly inclined to nest in the vicinity of 
human dwellings ; while the winter wren con- 
fines itself to secluded places. Lastly, it must 
have happened to him, ere this writing, to hear 
the robin, the wren, the meadow lark, and 
many another ecstatic bird, sing on the ground, 
disproving his too hasty deduction that contact 
with the earth throws a mute spell over these 
delicious musicians. " The Birds' Calendar " 
is illustrated with twenty-four full-page photo-

graphs of stuffed specimens, which, mounted 
by expert taxidermatists, simulate life as per- 
fectly perhaps as they can be made to do. Yet, 
looking at them, we are forced to quote Mr. 
Parkhurst's own remark, that " There is some- 
thing depressing, almost melancholy, in these 
dead and withered specimens, . . . when one 
has seen their living joyous confreres in their 
native haunts." 

It is interesting to note how the fascinations 
of nature will take hold of the strongest and 
most cultivated minds. It is the sensitive and 
enthusiastic temperament, of course, which 
yields most quickly and completely to the 
beauty and wonder pervading our universe ; 
yet few are so stolid as not to confess their pow- 
erful charm when once it has touched the inner 
vision. Such thoughts occur on opening the 
collection of " Summer Studies of Birds and 
Books," by Mr. W. Warde Fowler. Here is 
a grave and serious Oxford man frankly rank- 
ing himself among the passionate lovers of 
" His best of harmless beings, the marvellous 
creatures endowed with flight and song." He 
will make nothing of going to the remotest 
point in Europe to make the acquaintance of 
some rare species, to hear its unaccustomed 
melody or discover the secrets of its domestic 
life ; and nothing will so thrill his soul with 
delight as some new experience that can add 
to his already intimate knowledge of the birds 
of his continent. Genuine interest and affec- 
tion are captivating traits, and make a pleasant 
companion of almost anyone ; and such we 
find Mr. Fowler, especially in his long and sug- 
gestive talk about the songs of birds, their 
origin, variety, exquisite finish, and mode of 
delivery ; and also in his lecture on the great 
work of Aristotle in the province of natural 
history, and his astonishingly wide and close 
observation of the birds of Greece. Mr. Fow- 
ler's book is composed of lectures and papers 
which have grown out of his open-air studies 
in England, Wales, and Switzerland, and have 
had in many cases previous publication. All 
save one relate to the same subject, and that 
one is a feeling memoir of an old friend, a fa- 
vorite fox-terrier whose noble traits earned the 
lasting regard of his master. 

" The Pocket Guide to the Common Land 
Birds of New England," by Mr. M. A. Will- 
cox, has decided virtues to commend it. First, 
its portable proportions, exactly fitted to the 
pocket ; next, its agreeable style and simple con- 
struction ; and lastly, its trustworthiness. It 
does not pretend to do more than introduce the 



reader to our common birds, and this it hap- 
pily accomplishes with respect to eighty-seven 
species no inconsiderable number. After one 
has profited by all the little volume has to give, 
there will be a really large amount of knowl- 
edge acquired, and the best preparation made

We are almost inclined to think that Chicago 
has found what Carlyle would have called a Voice. 
When Mr. Henry Fuller abandoned the fascinating 
society of the European chevaliers and chatelaines of 
his airy imagination, and turned instead to the bank- 
ing-clerks and " lunch-counter " girls, the self-made 
men and " social leaders " of his native city, it was 
a descent, indeed, from the plane of poetry to the 
lower plane of prose. Yet the change of base seems

to us to have been a fortunate one, for, after all, 
Arcopia and La Trinite" are regions whereof anyone 
may write more or less intelligently ; whereas Chi- 
cago has been heretofore the most virgin of literary 
soil. Moreover, in taking for his theme the tumult- 
uous and strident civilization of the great Lake- 
side City, Mr. Fuller has planted himself upon the 
solid ground of reality. To every writer of fiction 
there comes the urgent appeal of " the here and the 
now " for artistic expression ; and to neglect this 
appeal for sake of the romantic charm attaching to 
the remote must be, for all the vagueness of outline 
and iridescent coloring of " far-off things," rather 
a confession of weakness than a sign of strength. 
Besides, we cannot escape the impression, warranted 
as it seems to be by "The Cliff Dwellers" and "With 
the Procession," that their author has decided to 
reculer pour mieux sauter, which is nearly always 
a wise thing to do. That he will " go far " upon 
his new path is not an improbable prediction, in view 
of the distinct advance indicated by the second novel 
in comparison with the first. " With the Procession " 
exhibits, with what may fairly be called an extra- 
ordinary talent, the life of the city in which the ac- 
tion is placed not the external life as the painter 
would view it so much as the inner life, the ambi- 
tions and the ideals, the sympathies and the points 
of view, the crudities and the maladjustments, pro- 
ducing so bizarre an impression upon the objective 
spectator, who perceives dimly that some sort of a 
distinctive civic type is struggling to emerge from 
the chaotic mass, but who cannot for the life of him 
prefigure the type. Mr. Fuller, certainly, has not 
prefigured it, but he has viewed the seething pro- 
cess of development with a degree of insight that 
no other novelist has brought to the task, and felic- 
ities of acute observation confront us from every 
page of the book. There is certainly an over-insist- 
ence upon detail now and then, and it is equally 
certain that there exist other and more agreeable 
sorts of Chicagoans than those here delineated. But 
then, there were other sorts of Londoners than those 
to whom Dickens and even Thackeray introduced 
us, which does not make our gratitude toward those 
novelists any the less. It is only a ludicrous hy- 
persensitiveness that could blame Mr. Fuller for 
having made his own selection of characters. Those 
whom he has chosen to present to us offer enough 
variety to make interesting the story of their rela- 
tions, and every one of them is portrayed with truth- 
fulness and sincerity. The galled jade may wince at 
some of the episodes, but the withers of the thought- 
ful Chicagoan, who knows well enough that his city 
has the defects of its qualities, will remain unwrung. 

" The Story of Christine Rochefort " is pleasing 
and in good taste, but it may hardly be called strong. 
In characterization it is very unsatisfactory, for 
none of the people who figure in its pages are in 
any real sense alive. It deals with French life in 
the provincial town of Blois ; and labor troubles, as 
they present themselves to the French manufacturer, 



are its chief theme. Mrs. Prince's envisagement 
of the problem of socialism is not open to serious 
criticism, and her standpoint is that of sobriety ; but 
she decidedly oversteps the line between fiction- 
writing and economic discussion when she repro- 
duces almost in full the speeches made at the labor- 
meeting which has so determining an influence upon 
the fortunes of her leading characters. 

The Treasure of the Incas has fired the imag- 
ination of many a romancer before now, and we 
are not surprised to find it once more pressed into 
service. But it is a little astonishing to discover in 
the latest poacher upon the preserves of Mr. Rider 
Haggard and the rest no less incongruous a person 
than Mr. Stockton. In penning " The Adventures of 
Captain Horn " the author has indeed, as the adver- 
tisements say, written in " a new vein." The essen- 
tial whimsicality of his work, whatever his theme, 
certainly gives piquancy to the tale, and goes far 
to justify the use of his extremely threadbare mate- 
rial. The Rackbirds alone are worth reading the 
book for, to say nothing of the estimable Mrs. Cliff 
and her California!! blankets. The story of the 
finding of the treasure, and of its removal, would 
be more thrilling if we did not feel all the time that 
the narrator is laughing in his sleeve. But the in- 
genuity of invention displayed, and the frequent re- 
currence of the unexpected, keep the reader's atten- 
tion alert, and carry him safely through a concatena- 
tion of episodes which, if taken too seriously, would 
probably be found merely dull. 

The unregenerate reader of adventure-crammed 
romance, however, does not enjoy the suspicion that 
sport is being made of him, and demands that his 
story-tellers should take their tales as seriously as 
he himself is disposed to take them while under 
their spell. We fancy that such unregenerates wSl 
prefer the naive imaginings of Mr. Rider Haggard to 
the obviously sophisticated imaginings of Mr. Stock- 
ton. As for the regenerate, we need not consider 
their feelings at all in the matter, for such of their 
spokesmen as Mr. Howells and Mr. Boyesen have 
repeatedly informed us that their contempt and 
their scorn are catholic enough to embrace the whole 
range of imaginative romance, from Mr. Haggard 
to Robert Louis Stevenson. Mr. Haggard's " Heart 
of the World," like Mr. Stockton's tale of adven- 
ture, deals with a hidden treasure this time the 
treasure of the Montezumas, not of the Incas. 
There is also a mysterious Indian city in the heart 
of Central America, the home of an unknown race, 
and the storehouse of the treasure in question. 
The scenario of the tale is almost identical with 
that of " Montezuma's Daughter," or " The Peo- 
ple of the Mist "; but the author's fertility in the 
invention of new incident saves the book from be- 
ing dismissed as a mere repetition, and gives new 
interest to situations that would seem, from any out- 
line description, unbearably hackneyed. The style, 
of course, is as roughshod as ever, and the arrange- 
ment of material as glaringly theatrical.

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



The romancer bent upon buried treasure, to whose 
imagination the hoards of Incas and Montezumas 
do not appeal, has always the resource of the pirate 
and the Spanish Main. To these themes Mr. Owen 
Rhoscomyl has turned in " The Jewel of Ynys 
Galon," and the only novel feature of his treatment 
is provided by the fact that his pirates are Welsh- 
men, and that the scene of their exploits is a rocky 
island off the coast of Wales. There are in this 
book a great many of what the writer loves to call 
" bloody horrors," and the quality of his narrative 
may best be illustrated by a brief extract : 

" Just as I was expecting sudden death I heard a roar 
of dry rage, and past me gleamed a weapon all horrible 
with grey brains and crimson with blood that dropped 
from it as it swung. It was the brass butt of the blun- 
derbuss in Will Barry's hand, and, as it fell upon the 
nearest skull, smashed it to pulp." 

This book, for those who like this sort of thing, will 
undoubtedly prove the sort of thing they like. The 
illustrations are, in the present case, exceptionally 
spirited and happy in execution, offering a striking 
contrast to the slovenly and chaotic bits of impres- 
sionism that it would be a misnomer to call the illus- 
trations to Mr. Haggard's Mexican romance. 

Mr. Zangwill's " The Master " is an exasperat- 
ing book. More than half of it is padding, dis- 
guised barely if at all ; the remaining fraction em- 
bodies a strong conception of character, and contains 
the stuff whereof good fiction is made. As for the 
superfluous moiety of the work, it is difficult to have 
any patience with it. There is a great deal of ar- 
tistic " shop " of the cheapest sort ; there is even 
more of dilute and sentimental rhetoric. The style 
is nearly always unfinished, and often bad. Yet 
through this maze of scamped workmanship we fol- 
low the clue of the hero's diversified career, and 
share something of the joy with which he conquers, 
Art, to begin with, and then, after a fashion, and 
not without a bitter spiritual struggle, Life. Re- 
duced to reasonable dimensions, pruned of its exu- 
berant offshoots, the sharpness of some of its con- 
trasts toned to a closer semblance of reality, and 
worked over with the file from first to last, this 
book might be transformed into a creation worthy 
of the lofty ideal that the writer has evidently set 
himself, but failed to embody in a satisfactory man- 
ner. Natural facility has been Mr. Zangwill's bane, 
and overmuch journalism has wellnigh wrecked in 
him what might have been an admirable talent for 
description and characterization. 

Several translations of Continental fiction, includ- 
ing works by some of the foremost of living novel- 
ists, are among the publications selected for review 
in the present article. First in importance of these 
books is Mr. Curtin's translation of the latest work 
of Henryk Sienkiewicz, " Rodzina Polanieckich." 
This title, which means " The Polanyetski Family," 
has been set aside for no adequate reason, and for 
it "Children of the Soil" has been substituted. 
Such a title is amply justified, however, by the tenor 



of the narrative, which deals for the most part with 
Poles of intensely national type, and which brings 
into frequent prominence that attachment to the 
country in the sense of pays rather than of patrie 
which is one of the best elements of national 
character, whether in Poland or elsewhere. This 
aspect of the work is well illustrated by the heroine 
when she says : 

" More than once, when I went out to the fields in 
spring, and saw that all things were growing, I felt that 
my heart, too, was growing with them. And now I 
know why that is : In all other relations that a man 
holds there may be deceit, but the land is truth. It is 
impossible to deceive the land; it either gives, or gives 
not, but it does not deceive. Therefore land is loved, 
as truth; and because one loves it, it teaches one to love. 
And the dew falls not only on grain, and on meadows, 
but on the soul, as it were; and a man becomes better, 
for he has to deal with truth, and he loves, that is, he 
is nearer God." 

The passage we have quoted is not alone illustra- 
tive of a special aspect of the story, but also of the 
simple and wholesome feeling that pervades it 
throughout. In point of fact, the Polanyetski's and 
their friends are city-dwellers during most of the 
period covered by the narrative, and only at the 
beginning and the end are they brought into inti- 
mate relations with " the soil." They form a group 
of interesting men and women, differentiated into 
a sufficient variety of types, and delineated in a 
manner that is nothing less than masterly. The 
interest centres about Stanislav Polanyetski and his 
wife Marynia, whom we come to know and love as 
if we had lived with them for years. It is easy 
enough to love Marynia, who is saintly without be- 
ing insipid, sweet without being tiresome, and whose 
purity of soul by imperceptible degrees raises Stan- 
islav to something like her own level. The delinea- 
tion of the husband is an even greater triumph ; for 
he is, after all, the homme sensuel moyen whom we 
all know, and it requires something of a struggle 
for the novel-reader, accustomed to heroes of strik- 
ing personality, to admit the right of such a man to 
occupy the most conspicuous place in a great work 
of fiction. In fact, the triumph is not unlike that 
achieved by Freytag in " Soil und Haben." In 
the end, Stanislav wins our allegiance completely, 
and the story of his spiritual development, as the 
translator with justice remarks, "is of interest to 
every person in civilized society." " Children of the 
Soil " occupies a middle position between the highly 
analytical and introspective "Without Dogma" and 
the magnificent historical trilogy, with its glowing 
scenes and its tremendous sweep, by which the au- 
thor is best known. It is strictly a modern novel, 
but it offers none of those aberrations of tendency 
to which many modern novelists weakly resort. 
The strength of the book is in its entire sanity, its 
freedom from exaggeration or sensationalism, and 
its psychological insight. It must be reckoned 
among the finer fictions of our time, and shows its 
author to be almost as great a master in the field

of the domestic novel as he had previously been 
shown to be in that of imaginative historical ro- 
mance. Yet we must, in conclusion, express a slight 
preference for the chronicler of the seventeenth- 
century Commonwealth over the novelist of nine- 
teenth - century Warsaw. The " fierce wars and 
faithful loves " of the former represent an even 
higher reach than the delicate delineations and sober 
philosophies of the latter. But, viewed in either 
aspect, the work of Henryk Sienkiewicz has already 
earned for him a place in the foremost rank of liv- 
ing novelists. 

" Majesty " seems to us the most important book 
that Heer Couperus has yet produced. It is, like 
its predecessors, largely a work of psychological 
analysis, and the chief interest centres about a char- 
acter of distinctly degenerate type. But the out- 
come is not altogether gloomy, and the possibility 
of a regenerative process is dimly hinted at in the 
closing pages. All these things take on a height- 
ened significance from the fact that they concern, 
not an ordinary mortal, but the descendant of a 
great line of princes, himself the ruler of a great 
Empire. The problem seems to be something like 
this : Is the institution of monarchy a hopeless an- 
achronism in the present age of social discontent 
and aspiration, or is it possible that the institution 
may adapt itself to the new environment, and be- 
come once more the pillar of social order? The 
author does not solve this problem, but he at least 
hints that the second of the alternatives may offer 
the solution. The Empire in which the action lies 
has no place on the political map of Europe it is 
an eclectic or composite sort of Empire, drawn from 
the observation of several States yet the dominion 
of the Hapsburgs has clearly served more frequently 
than any other for a model, and Austrian conditions 
are more closely than any others reproduced. The 
Shakespearian " Uneasy lies the head that wears a 
crown " might well have been taken as a motto for 
this pathetic study of a soul eager to do what is best 
for his people, yet oppressed almost to the point of 
death by his intolerable sense of the responsibility 
attendant upon his exalted rank. A suggestive com- 
parison might be made between this work and Herr 
BjOrnson's treatment of a similar theme in his 
drama of "The King." 

Spain and the Netherlands are farther apart in 
the nineteenth century than they were in the six- 
teenth, but the intellectual ferment of our time has 
reached both countries alike, and we can pass from 
a Dutch to a Castilian author without the sense of 
discontinuity that would have been awakened a few 
years ago. " El Maestrante," the new novel of 
Seiior Vald^s, is not as modern a story as " La Es- 
puma," but it is painfully modern in its realistic 
method. This story of "The Grandee," as the trans- 
lator calls it, takes us to the provincial city of Oviedo 
(called Lancia in the book), where Seiior Vald^s 
spent his early youth, and the time is that of a gen- 
eration ago. As a document illustrative of bygone 



manners in a Spanish town the work has more value 
than it has considered as constructive art. It bears 
the impress of sincerity, and, in this respect, com- 
mands attentive interest, but its subject-matter of 
intrigue, cruelty, and horse-play is not engaging, 
and some of the scenes are quite beyond the pale 
of the artistically permissible. Mr. Edmund Gosse 
writes an introduction, giving some interesting par- 
ticulars of the author's life and earlier work. But 
even he, as sponsor for the translation, will not an- 
swer the question " Whether these maladies of the 
soul are or are not fit subjects for the art of the 
novelist," but leaves each reader to answer it for 
himself. 

It is a strangely pathetic story that Miss Sy- 
monds has translated from the German of Prince 
Schoenaich - Carolath. Steeped in sentiment and 
romantic color, it offers a striking enough contrast to 
the dull realism that still confronts us in the pages 
of most current novels, while it serves also to re- 
mind us that the feelings of those about whom the 
novelist writes for our entertainment or instruction 
are no less deserving of delineation than their activ- 
ities or their environment. This story of a poor stu- 
dent at a German university, into whose life the 
passion of love comes like the warm sun of spring- 
time, melting the snows of winter and flooding all 
his soul, is told with grace and eloquence ; its sin- 
cerity is so heartfelt that a certain vagueness of out- 
line and other amateurish characteristics may well 
be forgotten in the beauty of the total impression. 
Yet it seems to us that the tragic conclusion is a 
little forced, certainly not made quite inevitable by 
the temperament and the antecedents of the per- 
sons concerned. So harsh an ending is not quite 
consonant with the tenor of so sweet an idyl, and 
the last pages find us unprepared for their sorrow- 
ful burden. 

The tragic idyl of Italy which Mr. Dole has ad- 
mirably translated from the German of Herr 
Schulze-Smidt takes us to the Lake of Garda, and 
does all that words can do to picture the scenery of 
that beautiful district. And against this lovely 
back-ground is sketched a story of human passion 
of sin, suffering, and atonement which for 
intensity of expression and sympathetic presenta- 
tion of some of the darker moods of the soul could 
not easily be matched. The story is simple enough 
in outline, and for that reason all the more impres- 
sive, since the attention is not often diverted from 
the central situation. The exquisite ending of the 
tale will linger in the memory long after the pages 
of the book are closed. 

" Frau Sorge " is the only one of Herr Suder- 
mann's novels that we recollect to have seen in En- 
glish translation previous to the appearance of " The 
Wish," the work now before us. " Der Wunsch " is 
one of the tales published in the " Geschwister " col- 
lection about ten years ago. It has the dimensions of 
a novel, although not a lengthy one, and is one of the 
most finished productions of the author's art. The 



22

[July l, 



story hangs entirely upon a psychological experience 
familiar to almost everyone, but not taken seriously 
except by a morbidly developed mind here and there. 
There are probably few people who do not, in their 
musings, now and then picture to themselves the 
death of those nearest and dearest to them, and re- 
flect upon the possible consequences of such an oc- 
currence. Nor are there many who, if such a hap- 
pening were to bring in its train some personal grat- 
ification, or the realization of some ambition (such 
as rank, or fortune, or love), do not catch them- 
selves at times abstracting the sad features of the 
death thus imagined, and contemplating it for an 
instant or two in what may be called its pleasant 
aspect. With the healthy mind, of course, this ab- 
straction is only momentary, being promptly in- 
vaded by the flood of sorrowful associations that 
cannot long be kept at bay. Now the mind that 
has developed a morbid ethical consciousness may 
be so distressed at the thought that such an abstrac- 
tion although natural and even inevitable was 
at all possible as to feel a grievous sense of sin in 
consequence of the experience, although it knows 
perfectly well that the will, which alone determines 
sin in any real sense, could not by any possibility 
become enlisted in behalf of so evil an imagining, 
that such a wish could never become translated into 
act. It is such a consciousness that Herr Suder- 
mann depicts in the present story a consciousness 
that can find expiation for its imagined sin only in 
suicide. Our criticism of the story is not that it 
should deal with so essentially morbid a psycholog- 
ical state, but that it should seem to countenance 
the notion that a wish thus formulated which is 
neither a real wish nor so much as a velleity is a 
serious ground for self-reproach, to say nothing of 
its being a ground for so heroic a measure as self- 
destruction. The ethical balance is not fairly held 
by the author, and his work suffers in consequence. 
For the rest, we cannot but praise the art with 
which this difficult situation is developed, or the 
fidelity of the descriptive touches that gives such 
marked reality to the life reproduced in these pages. 
Readers of the later dramas of Dr. Ibsen cannot 
fail to notice how typically Ibsenian is the problem 
above outlined, and with which the book is mainly 
concerned. The translation reads well in Miss Lily 
Kenkel's English, and the information about the 
author and his writings, supplied by Miss Elizabeth 
Lee, is both timely and interesting.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Whatever may be the errors (and 
they are relatively few) of M. Paul 
Bourget's widely read " Outre Mer " 
(Scribner), they are at least errors of imperfect or 
hurried observation, and not of prejudice. The mir- 
ror that he holds up to us is an unclouded one, wherein 
we may see what manner of men and women we are 
in the eyes of a cultured Frenchman who is a stu- 
dent of manners and a master of expression. M. 
Bourget did not come to our shores fettered with a 
ready-made theory of us into which the facts gath- 
ered must be made to fit. Facts first, conclusions 
afterwards, has been his rule. He does not cloy 
us with sugared words, like Sir Edwin Arnold ; or 
" blow us up," on the Mark Tapley plan ; nor does 
he merely exploit our oddities, like his loquacious 
compatriot " Max O'Rell." If he handles us " with- 
out gloves " on the score of our failings, he is equally 
candid when it comes to our merits of which he 
credits us with a liberal share. He foresees for us 
a tolerably hopeful future, albeit one fraught with 
perils, noted chiefly in unchecked, or unsifted, im- 
migration. Premising that, after the Civil War, 
" the Atlantic became the great conduit through 
which flowed all the malcontents of old Europe, 
especially of Germany," he concludes : " The day 
when excessive immigration shall have truly created 
two Americas in America, the conflict between these 
two worlds will be as inevitable as that between 
England and Ireland, and between Germany and 
France. Not against his employer will the Amer- 
ican workman of New York and Philadelphia be 
led to make war ; his employer and he will end by 
acting together against the foreign workman." M. 
Bourget is happier in his treatment of lighter topics. 
The " Impressions " of our Society, our Business 
Men, Lower Orders, Education, Pleasures, etc., are 
strictly impressions rapid, though shrewd, glimpses 
and jottings, gathered at random, and put together 
in a rather haphazard though very entertaining way.

is a great pleasure to come across anything so sim- 
ple and so effective as Dr. Weir Mitchell's " Philip 
Vernon" (The Century Co.). It is called "a tale 
in prose and verse," but really it is rather a little 
drama than anything else, coming near indeed in 
its construction and handling to the possibilities of 
stage presentation. So many of the literary dramas 
of our time, though meant for the stage, are found 
to be effective only in book form. This work, though 
apparently written with no idea of representation, 
seems to have dramatic possibilities that would not 
be so very hard to realize. We have perhaps noth- 
ing more than a fifth act ; but at any rate it is a 
strong combination of real emotions wrought up to 
a situation powerfully, if simply, handled. The time 
of the Armada gives a sort of electric atmosphere,

A new life of 
Archbishop Laud. 



charged with high feeling and great adventure. The 
local color, the old English inn, the chase, and the 
garden of the great manor, gives a touch of roman- 
tic beauty. The characters, a Roman priest, two 
young English gallants, and a beautiful gentle- 
woman, are brought together in a story which, if 
not extraordinarily novel or especially ingenious, 
has at least the merit of holding one's interest. At 
the beginning, one reads a little suspiciously. "Why 
should anyone bother to string together a lot of 
rhymes about the time of Queen Elizabeth ? " But 
one reaches the end with an increased respect for 
the author, with the relieved calm that comes after 
emotional tension, and with the feeling that this 
slim little book may really be one of those things so 
hard to detect at first sight, so easy to recognize 
when detected, a gain to literature. Dr. Mitchell 
does not strive nor cry very much in this work, but 
there is something in it that is better than much that 
may be found in the more hysteric efforts of some 
who are much more conscious of their own import- 
ance. 

The new life of William Laud, by 
Mr. W. H. Hutton, in the " Leaders 
of Religion " series ( Houghton ), 
gives in popular form an account of the real man 
as judicial students of seventeenth-century history 
have agreed in estimating him. Probably no great 
man has suffered more or longer from the assaults 
of religious and political passion than the great arch- 
bishop, the greatest, our author thinks, who has 
sat in the chair of Augustine since the Reformation. 
We hope that this book will be read by many who 
will never look into the great works of Ranke and 
Gardiner, and will thus be led to see that Laud was 
a high-souled prelate and statesman, though he made 
one of the worst mistakes a statesman can make, 
that of misjudging the temper of the times and the 
forces at work among the people. Though his work 
seemed to go down in an awful crash, yet when the 
Church came back at the Restoration it was on the 
basis of his plans and ideals. The completeness of 
his immediate failure should not blind us to the great- 
ness of his aims. His misfortunes came not from his 
being a Papist at heart, as his Puritan foes charged, 
but from his not being a Puritan. This he could 
not be : he believed in order, reverence, forms ; and 
as head of the Church he endeavored to further 
what he believed would conduce to true worship, 
but he did not do this in the spirit of the bigot or 
the tyrant. 

The plays written by our great poets 
of the present century have, as a rule, 
enriched that department of literature 
known as the " closet drama." " The Borderers," 
" Remorse," " The Ayrshire Tragedy," " Manfred," 
"The Cenci," "Harold," "The Blot on the Scut- 
cheon," " Chastelard " (to mention no more), have 
been, some not well suited to the stage, some frankly 
intended for the closet. Too often the closet which 
has received them has been by no means the quiet

study of the lover of letters, but rather that sort of 
dark up-stairs closet into which one puts such liter- 
ary rubbish as must be kept but cannot be allowed 
to clutter up the library. This literary tendency 
(aided by present predictions of a new dramatic 
period) has now produced a stupendous, if not an 
unnatural, blossom in " Ernest England : A Soul 
Laid Bare," by J. A. Parker. This work is in the 
form of a drama in prose and verse, and its most ob- 
vious characteristic is its length, in which it exceeds 
" Hamlet," the First Part of " Faust," and "Le Cid," 
all put together ; even approaching the fabled por- 
tents of India and China. Keats, thinking of Leigh 
Hunt's question, Why write a long poem? asked, 
" Do not the lovers of poetry like to have a little 
region to wander in, where they may pick and choose, 
and in which the images are so numerous that many 
are forgotten and found new on a second reading? " 
Besides being a long poem, " Ernest England " re- 
sembles " Endymion " in being delightful reading 
for the reviewer of the old " Quarterly " type, and 
for such a reader the prodigy of its length is no 
drawback, since it offers only the richer store of 
ridiculous missiles to hurl at the unfortunate author, 
who has really offered more excuse for such treat- 
ment than a sane man should do. 



Mr. Reuben G. Thwaites has recently

pioneer history by his careful work 
in editing the revision of Alexander Withers's 
"Chronicles of Border Warfare " (Robert Clarke 
Co.). The book was first published in the thirties, 
when the author, an enthusiastic antiquarian, was 
able to gather original material from some of those 
who participated in the events described. It was 
read in every pioneer home, sometimes literally read 
to pieces, so that copies of it became scarce long 
ago. Its value was at once recognized, and in its 
new form this value has been many times increased 
because of peculiar circumstances. The late Lyman 
C. Draper visited the regions described by Withers, 
very soon after the publication of the latter's book. 
He verified the facts described; he interviewed 
many old settlers ; he made copious notes from the 
standpoint of a historian. But he was not so much 
an editor as a collector ; and when his literary labors 
closed, perhaps with the writing of one of the foot- 
notes for this new volume, his literary executor, Mr. 
Thwaites, took up the work, and the revision comes 
to the reader rich with the notes of Withers the 
original author, of Dr. Draper the enthusiastic in- 
vestigator, and of Mr. Thwaites the painstaking 
editor. The old edition of Withers was considered 
final authority ; the new one is better, because it has 
the advantage of modern ideas of bookmaking and 
scholarly notions of editing. The warfare of the 
border was savage, and many a scalp was taken, as 
the humble cabin of the pioneer went up in smoke ; 
but scenes like those described were absolutely neces- 
sary to the taming of the wilderness for the steady 
settler of later days.

Troubadours 
and Courts 
of Love. 



The first volume of the " Social En- 
gland Series " (Macmillan) is writ- 
ten by Mr. I. F. Rowbotham, M.A., 
and devoted to "The Troubadours and Courts of 
Love." A theme so romantic raises high expecta- 
tions of interest ; yet there are few literary subjects 
requiring more drudgery and delving on the part 
of an author. Most of the writings of the trouba- 
dours are still in manuscript, and must be studied 
chiefly in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, the 
Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the British Mus- 
eum at London. Moreover, the bulk of them are 
written in a tongue different not only from modern 
English, but different also from the English of 
Chaucer and the other early poets. But the reader's 
expectations in the present work are not disap- 
pointed ; the history runs on, without appearance 
of labor, from the time of the first troubadours in 
England early in the twelfth century, to their de- 
cline and fall about one hundred and fifty years 
later. The general character of the poetry of the 
troubabours is described, with citations ; their quali- 
fications and characteristics as an aristocratic caste 
are set forth ; and their influences on society, partly 
refining and partly pernicious, is revealed. Wher- 
ever there was chivalry, there were troubadours and 
courts of love. But with the annihilation of the 
bright and glittering society which had been min- 
strelsy's chief inspirer and genial patron, the chief 
stimulus to poetry and song vanished, and the gay 
reign of love and the troubadours was past forever. 
Thirteen pictures copied from old tapestries or 
mural decorations, and several old musical scores, 
furnish quaint illustrations of the text. 



Mr. Francis Walker's " Letters of a 
Baritone" (Scribner) are the record 
of a young man's experiences while 
in Italy for purposes of voice-culture. Writing to his 
sister, he adopts a familiar and discursive style, in 
which personal adventures and practical affairs are 
mingled with discourse on nature, art, criticism, and 
as much information of a technical sort relating to 
his own studies as it is possible to communicate with- 
out illustrations viva voce. The book is not with- 
out interest to the general reader, but its special 
value is for the student of vocal art. Here he will 
learn the reasons why he should go to Italy, rather 
than to any other country, for instruction ; why he 
should not delay too long ; what are the effects of 
bad teaching ; who should and who should not study 
to become professional singers ; and how to achieve 
most comfort with least expense while dwelling 
abroad. 

In The Great War with Russia " 
(Routledge), by Mr. W. H. Russell, 
we have that veteran's story of his 
pioneer work as war-correspondent, and of his per- 
sonal experiences in that long series of blunders and 
horrors, lighted up with some brilliant deeds, which 
we call the Crimean War. The world is no longer 



interested in that war and its controversies as to 
who was most responsible for the misfortunes of the 
British army. The chief interest of the book lies in 
the humble beginnings there shown of the expansion 
of the field of the modern newspaper. Mr. Rus- 
sell was without military protection or standing, and 
only explicit orders from the government enabled 
him to secure bare tolerance. It was with good 
reason that the officers of the old school did all they 
could to drive him from the army, for his plain 
account of what he saw from day to day showed 
such mismanagement and official folly that a great 
cry of wrath went up from all England, and re- 
forms were instituted that put an end forever to the 
whole system. This was an honorable achievement, 
and the story of it is well told. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The new English translation of Herr Bjoruson's 
" Arne " (Macmillan), while not altogether satisfactory, 
appears to be an improvement upon the hitherto exist- 
ing versions. The work was done by Mr. Walter Low, 
who died shortly after its completion, and whose career 
forms the subject of Mr. Gosse's sympathetic prefatory 
pages. " The Fisher Maiden," also translated by Mr. 
Low, will be the next volume to appear in this edition. 

A handsome library edition of Mr. Hardy's " Far 
from the Madding Crowd " comes to us from Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. There is an etched frontispiece 
and a sketch-map of " The Wessex of the Novels." Of 
much interest is the prefatory note in which Mr. Hardy 
tells how he came to naturalize the term " Wessex " in 
modern English for purposes of descriptive topography. 
The term, somewhat to the author's surprise, has since 
found general favor, and he now feels impelled to beg 
of his readers that they " refuse steadfastly to believe 
that there are any inhabitants of a Victorian Wessex 
outside the pages of this and the companion volumes in 
which they were first discovered." 

" The White Tsar and Other Poems " (Tait) is the 
title of a volume by Mr. Henry Bedlow. The other 
poems are two in number " Dies Caniculares," a series 
of contemplative stanzas, and " Beclaweeyeh," an Ori- 
ental tale. As for the " White Tsar," he is none other 
than the polar bear. Ordinarily these three sets of verses 
would hardly fill the thinnest of volumes, but by giving 
a full page to each eight-line stanza, by setting opposite 
each a full-page illustration, and by leaving the alter- 
nate pages blank, the work is made to assume imposing 
dimensions. The poetical quality of Mr. Bedlow's verse 
is not conspicuous, and there are stanzas which it would 
be cruel to quote. The illustrations, which display some 
imaginative power, are the work of Mr. J. Steeple Davis. 

Mr. Miner W. Bruce is the author of a book on 
" Alaska, Its History and Resources, Gold Fields, 
Routes, and Scenery," published at Seattle by the Low- 
man & Hanford Co. Mr. Bruce's treatment of the sub- 
ject is based upon extensive personal acquaintance with 
the country, and is strictly up to date. His journalistic 
training has enabled him to make a readable book, and 
both settlers and tourists will be likely to find it help- 
ful. Many photographs and a map are provided by 
way of illustration.

A BALLADE OF POETS. 



Where are the poets of the past 

Whose voices rang divinely true ? 

Whose thoughts munificent and vast 

From stars and suns their music drew ? 
To whom the gods a welcome blew, 

And lamps from far Parnassus shone ? . . . 
None dare the heights to which they flew, 

Since Alfred Tennyson is gone. 

The freshening gale strained spar and mast, 

The billows great and greater grew; 
The vessel forward sped and fast, 

Nor port nor anchorage she knew; 

Naught recked they of the circling view, 
Their only end was to sweep on. . . . 

Vanished are captain, ship, and crew, 
Since Alfred Tennyson is gone. 

Now lesser men their fortunes cast 

In lesser seas, and zephyrs woo; 
Their lutes are thin, they cannot last, 

We listen but to say adieu. 

The artificial gems they strew 
Of specious glitter fade anon. . . . 

Is there no granite left to hew, 
Since Alfred Tennyson is gone ? 

ENVOY. 
Fled are the mighty bards and few; 

The ways of song are barren, wan. . . . 
Fled is the perfect manner, too, 

Since Alfred Tennyson is gone.

LITERARY NOTES. 



Dr. W. L. Phelps is editing a volume of Chapman 
for the " Mermaid series." 

A civil list pension of 100 a year has been bestowed 
upon the widow of Philip Gilbert Hamerton. 

Mr. Bradlee Whidden, of Boston, issues a priced cat- 
alogue of works upon natural history, so neat and well- 
arranged as to be worth filing for reference. 

The Chautauqua circles are to devote the coming 
year to an " American " course of reading, and special 
text-books on American history and literature are in 
course of preparation. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce " The Modern 
Reader's Bible," a series of books from the Scriptures 
presented in modern literary form. Four books of 
" Wisdom Literature " will be the first issued. 

Dr. Ibsen is to have a monument erected in his honor 
during his lifetime. It is to be by a well-known sculp- 
tor, Herr Stephan Sinding, and will stand in front of 
the Royal Theatre at Christiania. 

Two fellowships, of six hundred dollars each, in the 
American School at Athens, are offered for the year 
1895-6. Professor J. W. White of Harvard will fur- 
nish application blanks to those desirous of submitting 
their names. 

The fourth performance in Paris of Wagner's " Tann- 
hauser " was given this year. M. Van Dyck sang the 
title-role, and it is a curious coincidence that he was 
born on the very day of the third performance, in 1861, 



when the opera was hissed off the Parisian stage, not 
to be produced again until an entire generation should 
have elapsed. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are preparing a series 
of " English Classics," edited by competent men, and 
having particular reference to the existing entrance re- 
quirements of the colleges. Professor G. R. Carpenter 
is the general editor of the series. 

Mr. Frederick Locker- Lampson, author of " London 
Lyrics," and one of the most graceful writers of society 
verse, died on the 28th of May, at the age of seventy- 
four. He was perhaps even better known as a collector 
of books, drawings, and autographs than as a poet. 

" Friedrich Eduard Beneke : The Man and His Phil- 
osophy " is the title of a monograph by Dr. Francis 
Burke Brandt, published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., 
under the auspices of Columbia College, as the fourth 
volume of its series of " Contributions to Philosophy, 
Psychology, and Education." The main thesis of the 
work is that Beneke, rather than Fichte or Hegel, was 
the true continuator of the Kantian philosophy, and that 
in his work we have " the prbfoundest metaphysical 
insight of our century." 

Provost Charles C. Harrison of the University of 
Pennsylvania has made to that institution a gift of half 
a million dollars, to constitute a Foundation in memory 
of his father, thus following the noteworthy example of 
President Low of Columbia. The following suggestions 
as to the use of the resulting income were made by the 
donor: 1. The establishment of scholarships and fel- 
lowships. 2. An increase of the University Library. 
3. The temporary relief of professors from their reg- 
ular work, permitting them to engage in research. 4. 
The engagement of non-residents to lecture for a term 
at the University. 

Messrs. Funk & Wagnalls announce it as their inten- 
tion to introduce into all of their publications a lengthy 
series of " reform spellings " (such as beutif ul, glimps, 
oger, skul, and yern), " provided a reasonable number 
of other periodicals, and writers, and business men will 
adopt the same so as to help break the force of the 
criticism that may oppose." It is hardly necessary for 
THE DIAL to say that it must decline the invitation to 
participate in any such phonetic vandalism, and that it 
will continue, as heretofore, to stand for good spelling 
no less than for good literature, opposing all attempts 
to vulgarize either the one or the other. 

The following verses, by Miss Mathilde Blind, are 
taken from an English paper, and were inspired by 
reading the "Rubaiyat" in a Kentish rose-garden: 
" Beside a Dial in the leafy close, 
Where every bush was burning with the Rose, 
With million roses falling flake by flake 
Upon the lawn in fading summer snows : 

"I read the Persian Poet's rhyme of old, 
Each thought a ruby in a ring of gold 
Old thoughts so young, that, after all these years, 
They 're writ on every rose-leaf yet unrolled. 

" You may not know the secret tongue aright 
The Sunbeams on their rosy tablets write ; 
Only a poet may perchance translate 
Those ruby-tinted hieroglyphs of light." 
We are glad to note that the poet had a DIAL by her 
side. 

Sir Walter Besant, in " The Author," thus discourses 
upon his new dignity: "I think that I may very prop- 
erly make this the place for a brief note concerning the

distinction lately conferred upon me. It is, in fact, a 
national recognition of this Society and of its work in ad- 
vancing the dignity and the independence of literature. 
The Earl of Rosebery iu his letter to me expressly 
pointed out that this distinction was offered in recog- 
nition of services which, he kindly says, have been ren- 
dered by me to the dignity of literature. These hum- 
ble services could only be effective through such an 
organization as our own. It is, therefore, the Society 
itself which has, for the first time, received recogni- 
tion." We shall, however, continue to think that Sir 
Walter's deserts are not wholly conditioned upon his 
management of the Society of Authors. 

THE CENTRAL LANGUAGE CONFERENCE. 

As the result of a circular letter which has been dis- 
cussed for several months, representatives of nine col- 
leges in the Mississippi Valley met in Chicago, June 21, 
to organize a conference of the teachers of modern lan- 
guages in the district which the railroads call Central. 
The proposal for such an organization seemed to come 
spontaneously from many sources at once, and as a 
natural result of the comparative isolation to which 
college men of the Middle West have been condemned. 
The conditions are in most respects the same as those 
which led to the recent conference of teachers of clas- 
sical languages in Ann Arbor, to the conference of En- 
glish teachers, and the association of teachers of his- 
tory and sociology, both formed last year. The need 
of personal contact with colleagues has been deeply felt. 
At the same time, the danger of detracting from the 
none too strong forces of the American Philological So- 
ciety and the Modern Language Association of America 
was duly weighed. AH of those engaged in the prelim- 
inary steps toward the new society are members of one 
or both of the old bodies, and expect to continue such. 
But it is believed that a society meeting at various 
points in the Middle West can enlist a great number 
of teachers who would not or who could not join the 
societies which meet so seldom within reach, and yet 
work together harmoniously with the older societies. 
In the matter of publication, it is hoped that the new 
society can support the older ones. 

In the course of a full discussion, lasting through 
two sessions, it was agreed to call the new society The 
Central Modern Language Conference; a constitution 
was adopted, subject to revision by the members pres- 
ent at the first regular meeting; the first regular meet- 
ing, with programme, is to be held in Chicago, during 
the Christmas recess, but not in the same week with the 
Modern Language Association; the membership fee was 
fixed at two dollars, and all persons interested in " the 
scientific study and teaching of English, French, Ger- 
man, or other living European languages " are invited 
to apply for membership through the Secretary. 

Provisional officers were chosen as follows: President, 
Professor W. H. Carruth, University of Kansas; Sec- 
retary and Treasurer, Professor H. Schmidt- Warten- 
berg, University of Chicago; Committee on Programme : 
Professors Karsten, Indiana State University, Edgren, 
University of Nebraska, Cutting, University of Chicago, 
and Baskervill, Vanderbilt University. 

It is understood that the territory of the new society 
extends from the Alleghauies to the Rockies, and from 
the lakes to the gulf. There is also a general feeling 
that the regular annual meetings should be held in the 
summer, or at least at some other time than the Christ- 
mas holidays.

in a loftier spirit than this poem of Mr. Block's, and the ex- 
ecution does not fall below the conception." Mr. JOHN W. 
CHADWICK in the Boston Register. 

" A complete and very beautiful epic, weighty with thought 
and from time to time pulsing with lyrical force, while never 
allowing the reader's mind to lose the sentiment of grandeur 
and power." London (England) Mercury. 

"The author's style is forcible and his thought vivid." 
New York Independent. 

" The first and last sections, with their poetic characteriza- 
tion of the supreme moments of history, show the author's 
work at its best, for they afford him the most opportunities 
for the fine philosophical generalizations towards which he is 
led by his natural bent." WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE in The 
Dial.

THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY. 

Professor Huxley died on the twenty-ninth 
of June, not without warning, and having to 
his account the exact scriptural tale of a man's 
years. A worker and a fighter all his life, the 
pen was in his hand when overtaken by the ill- 
ness that was to prove fatal in the end, and he 
was replying, with unabated vigor of expres- 
sion and force of logic, to the latest attack made 
by mysticism upon that stronghold of reasoned 
and ordered knowledge which we call science, 
and of which he had for nearly half a century 
been one of the doughtiest of defenders. 

In the popular consciousness, indeed, Hux- 
ley ranked among the leading representatives 
of English science, probably as the foremost 
among them after the death of his old-time col- 
league, John Tyndall. It may be worth while 
to consider for a moment what this estimate 
means. There is practically no such thing, in 
the present age of the world, as the represent- 
ation of science by any one man. Aristotle 
was perhaps the only man for whom, in any age, 
that distinction may be claimed. Nowadays, 
a man can represent science only by represent- 
ing biology, or physics, or geology, or something 
even narrower than these. Huxley represented 
English science in the sense that he gave a 
large part of his life to the subject of compar- 
ative anatomy, and made some fairly important 
contributions to our knowledge of that subject. 
But his work was not comparable to that, in 
their respective subjects, of such men as Far- 
aday, or Lyell, or Maxwell, to say nothing of 
Darwin. It was good work, without doubt, 
but it was equalled by a score of Englishmen 
of his own generation, and surpassed by a re- 
spectable number. 

But the average person, when he thinks of 
Huxley as a scientific leader, recks little of his 
comparative anatomy, and has probably never 
heard of the great work on " Oceanic Hydro- 
zoa," the manuals of vertebrate and inverte- 
brate anatomy, or even the monograph on 
" The Cray-Fish." It is a very different sort 
of work that has given Huxley his immense 
reputation, the work which, for the most part, 
may be found in the nine volumes of his " Col- 
lected Essays," and which is, of its kind, almost 
unparallelled in our literature. These volumes,

biological science in particular but they an- 
nounce no original investigations worth speak- 
ing of, and they are not contributions to scien- 
tific knowledge in any strict sense. Some will 
dismiss them with a sneer, as mere populariza- 
tions, as a sort of juggling with other men's 
ideas. This contemptuous procedure, it need 
hardly be said, gets no sympathy from us, and 
is as distinctly wrongheaded as the attempt, 
already discussed, to classify such books as 
" Man's Place in Nature " and " The Physical 
Basis of Life" among important scientific 
works. 

Wherein, then, lies the value of these nine 
volumes of essays, if it is inadequate to consider 
them as mere popularizations, however skilful, 
and quite wrong to call them contributions to 
science ? We should say that the first and most 
important claim to be made for them is that 
they reveal a strong philosophical thinker ; that 
beneath their graceful rhetoric and acute dia- 
lectic there is a Method of fundamental import- 
ance, clearly conceived, and rigorously applied 
to the special subject, whatever it may be, un- 
der consideration. What that method is may 
be seen plainly enough in any one among half 
a dozen of the more formal discussions ; most 
plainly, perhaps, in the noble essay, dated 1870, 
upon the " Discours de la Methode " of Des- 
cartes. Indeed, the author recognized the prin- 
ciple above stated as constituting the unifying 
element in his seemingly so diversified work 
when he gave to the initial volume of the re- 
vised edition of the " Essays " the significant 
title " Method and Results." And this title 
might have been made to cover the whole collec- 
tion, for we find, whether the subject of an essay 
be " Man's Place in Nature " or " Evolution 
and Ethics," the story of the Gadarene swine 
or the organization of the State, that the dis- 
cussion always proceeds upon well-defined lines, 
and with close reference to a controlling or- 
ganon. It was no vagary, as some of his read- 
ers thought, when he turned from his anatom- 
ical studies to write for the " English Men of 
Letters " a philosophical analysis of the work 
*>f Hume ; it was rather an indication of the 
xeal bent of his mind, which always looked be- 
jrond the half-unified knowledge of science to 
ithe fully-unified knowledge that we call phil- 
osophy. 

The healthy English mind is not distin- 
guished by an aptitude for metaphysics, and 
Huxley's mind was distinctly of the healthy 
English type. He was content with a method, 



when a Frenchman or a German would have 
been satisfied with nothing short of a system. 
Hence, he was willing to leave many of the 
questions of philosophy unanswered, content to 
carry his method as far as it would go, and to 
admit ignorance of the regions beyond. He 
even coined a word with which to name this 
philosophical attitude, and the immediate adop- 
tion and currency of that word showed that it 
met a long-felt want. Since it came into our 
circulation, agnosticism, like many other words, 
has been used as a counter by wise men and as 
a full-weight coin by fools, but it has justified 
itself, on the whole, as a useful addition to our 
philosophical terminology. 

The lectures and writings of our arch-agnostic 
have, during the past forty years, aroused a 
good many religious antagonisms ; some of these 
have become allayed by time, and some are still 
active. It took a bold Englishman in the six- 
ties to champion the Darwinian doctrine of de- 
scent and to combat the grotesque Miltonic 
theory of creation ; but Huxley was never lack- 
ing in courage, and he bore without flinching 
the brunt of theological attack and vilification. 
The world that is, all the world worth con- 
sidering came round to his side sooner than 
could have been anticipated by a student of 
the history of new and fruitful ideas of their 
long hard struggle with ignorance, and blind- 
ness, and all the banded legions of the old or- 
der of thought and the last score of years 
left to the stout-hearted philosopher were serene 
with the satisfaction of complete achievement 
in at least one important field of his endeavor. 
But the theory of creation was not the only 
stronghold occupied by the popular theology of 
his fellow-countrymen, and, when that was bat- 
tered down, there were others to be attacked. 
All these assaults were not, of course, directed 
against religion at all, any more than were the 
Voltairean assaults of a century previous, and 
the infame that Huxley sought to crush in the 
world of thought was as little deserving of con- 
sideration as was the engine of political and so- 
cial despotism which Voltaire's memorable and 
magnificent crusade did so much to demolish. 
We should say that Huxley, far from being an 
enemy of religion, was one of the best friends 
it has ever found, and we have no doubt that, 
from the more enlightened twentieth-century 
religious point of view, he will be remembered 
as such. 

For our part, the aspect of Huxley's life and 
work that compels the deepest gratitude is the 
absolute honesty by which that life and that

work were characterized throughout. One does 
not need to accept all of his conclusions to ad- 
mire the intellectual process by which they 
were reached. His logic may now and then 
have been at fault, but it scorned every species 
of sophistical subterfuge. To get at the truth, 
not merely to make a better-sounding argument 
than his opponent, was always his aim. He 
hated shams as Carlyle hated them, but, instead 
of inveighing at them with stormy prophecy 
(" I am not equal to the prophetical busi- 
ness "), he employed the better weapon of com- 
pactly-wrought argumentation. Very recently, 
taking a retrospective view of his life, he made 
this statement of what had been its aims and 
its guiding principles : 

"Men are said to be partial judges of themselves. 
Young men may be, I doubt if old men are. Life seems 
terribly foreshortened as they look back, and the moun- 
tain they set themselves to climb in youth turns out to 
be a mere spur of immeasurably higher ranges when, 
with failing breath, they reach the top. But if I may 
speak of the objects I have had more or less definitely 
in view since I began the ascent of my hillock, they are 
briefly these : To promote the increase of natural knowl- 
edge, and to forward the application of scientific meth- 
ods of investigation to all the problems of life, to the 
best of my ability, in the conviction, which has grown 
with my growth and strengthened with my strength, 
that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of man- 
kind except veracity of thought and action, and the 
resolute facing of the world as it is, when the garment 
of make-believe by which pious hands have hidden its 
uglier features is stripped off. It is with this intent 
that I have subordinated any reasonable, or unreason- 
able, ambition for scientific fame which I may have 
permitted myself to entertain, to other ends; to the 
popularization of science; to the development and organ- 
ization of scientific education; to the endless series of 
battles and skirmishes over evolution; and to untiring 
opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, 
which in England, as everywhere else, and to whatever 
denomination it may belong, is the deadly enemy of 
science." 

It is a noble apologia pro vita sua, and the 
world will not readily forget what it owes to 
this man's single-hearted devotion to truth. 
His tombstone should bear the inscription, Ver- 
itatem dilexi, that Renan asked to be cut upon 
his own, and the measure of his delight in the 
truth should be the measure of posterity's de- 
light in cherishing his memory.

EDWARD A. FREEMAN.* 



In bringing out " The Life and Letters of 
Edward A. Freeman," Dean Stephens has con- 
ferred a lasting obligation upon the student of 
history. It is not only of prime value to be 
able to see the great historian in his workshop 
and to breath the atmosphere of enthusiasm 
that always pervaded that sacred place, but, 
more and most, to come into close contact with 
a spirit singularly pure and noble, whose love 
of truth and violent hatred of sham breathes 
in every written line, this is high privilege 
indeed. 

The author has had the good sense to re- 
main silent himself for the most part, and let 
Mr. Freeman talk through his correspondence, 
a conversation all the more charming because 
he speaks altogether unconscious of the larger 
audience. The author is content, therefore, to 
play the part of gentleman usher, by whose 
kind offices the reader is introduced into that 
charmed circle which the years drew about this 
patriarch of the historical clan. Here Freeman 
held converse with Finlay and Stubbs, Bryce, 
Cox, Dawkins, and Goldwin Smith, Hodgkin, 
Kate Norgate, and the gifted granddaughter of 
Thomas Arnold,f whose departure into story- 
writing was always a grave disappointment to 
Freeman. This is the acme of good biography- 
making. 

Strange to say, however, Green, the John of 
this apostolic group, has been omitted. The 
Preface prepares us somewhat for this disap- 
pointment ; but the proposal to reserve the cor- 
respondence of Green for a third volume is not 
reassuring. It is because this part of Mr. 
Freeman's correspondence is so important, that 
Mr. Stephens says he has not presented it here. 
It is because it is so important that the reader 
has a right to expect it here. There are many 
minor letters to unimportant persons which 
contain only echoes of things elsewhere said. 
These could have been omitted. The whole 
discussion with Anthony Trollope on fox-hunt- 
ing, and all that is really important in the cor- 
respondence elicited, might have been given in 
a tithe of the space. Thus there is really no 
satisfactory reason why the correspondence with 
Green, the thing which the student of history

would prize most, the thing which he has a 
right to expect when he pays his seven dollars 
for these two volumes, should be omitted. 

Externally, the Life of Freeman offers little 
for the biographer. A life could hardly be 
more devoid of dramatic interest. Born in 
1823, at eighteen months left an orphan, 
brought up in a most exemplary way by an im- 
perious old grandmother, given the best educa- 
tion that England could offer, from childhood 
extremely sensitive to the religious and moral 
atmosphere that surrounded him, he passed 
safely over the period when most young men 
are supposed to be sowing wild oats, and ar- 
rived at manhood, a severe moralist, a devout 
religionist, and withal, possessed of a disposition 
unusually pure, strong, and wholesome. At 
this time the leaning of Mr. Freeman was 
strongly toward the Church. And yet his sym- 
pathies were with the devotional and ascetic 
side of the ministerial office, rather than its in- 
tellectual, or practical side. His plain and sim- 
ple mind found little satisfaction in the vague 
speculations of systematic theology ; while upon 
the humbler duties of the parish priest, he was 
too much of an aristocrat by nature ever to 
look with much satisfaction. Strange to say, 
however, the final decision against ordination 
turned upon his conviction that celibacy was 
the proper state for the clergy. Writing, Jan- 
uary 25, 1846, he says : 

" I have almost entirely given up the idea of ordina- 
tion, as I am getting every day more fully convinced 
of the necessity for the clergy to observe celibacy for 
every reason, both as in itself the holier estate, and 
therefore especially incumbent upon them, and also for 
the avoidance of secularity and sacrilege." (Vol. I., 
p. 62.) 

Freeman had already for some time back 
been engaged to a most estimable young lady, 
a Miss Eleanor Gutch. The question of ordi- 
nation was to be settled for him, and for her 
too. No mawkish sentimentalism clouded his 
purpose for the moment. The idea of separa- 
tion seems not for a moment to have been 
thought of. If he could not conscientiously 
take with him into the clerical profession the 
wife-to-be, he would himself keep out of orders. 
Moreover, at this time other ambitions were 
already stirring in his mind. On March 22, 
writing from Oxford, after stating that his con- 
victions on the question of clerical celibacy are 
now so strong that he has finally determined 
to remain a layman, he continues : 

" If I take up any profession, it would be architec- 
ture; but I would much rather, if I find myself suffi- 
ciently well off, have none. I have begun a course of 



reading which, if I carry it on, would go a good way 
through a tolerably long life. Besides philosophy, I 
work chiefly at history, of which I should much like to 
be master. My great ambition would be to get one of the 
History Professorships here." (I., p. 63.) 

The competence to which Mr. Freeman here 
refers was an income of 600, which fell to 
him from his father's estate ; and this was after- 
ward increased by what he inherited from his 
grandmother, who died in 1848. He was thus 
from the first placed beyond the need of follow- 
ing any profession at all ; and soon after his mar- 
riage with Miss Gutch, in 1847, he settled in 
a delightful little country-house in the valley of 
the Cam, and not far from the small town of 
Dursley. Here at Oaklands he began, for the 
man with literary tastes, an ideal life, " the most 
favorable of all conditions for steady literary 
work and study." In seven years he, or rather 
his library and his family, had outgrown Oak- 
lands. After some searching he found a home 
in southern England, near Cardiff, that suited 
him. Thither he moved in 1855. Of his new 
home, Lanrumney Hall, he thus wrote, in Sep- 
tember, to his old friend the Reverend Henry 
Thompson : 

" This is certainly a jolly place. From our church- 
yard and other elevated points we see all Zummerzet 
coast; and it is said that from some of the mountains 
more inland one can see right across to the English 
Channel. . . . Without deserting my books, I have 
turned farmer, and own 

2 Horses 1 Coon 

1 Pony 1 Dog 

4 Pigs 2 Goats 

29 Sheep 4 Cows

Ducks Cocks and hens. 

2 Cats 

Of these, two pigs and all the sheep and kine and ducks 
have been bought since I came here. We slay and eat 
patriarchally of our own, yet we do not eat so soon after 
death as Abraham did." (I., p. 177.) 

After five years he had again outgrown his 
quarters, and for a third and last time he 
moved, this time to Somerleaze, a comfortable 
and commodious house about two miles from 
Wells. Here he was still immured in the quiet 
isolation of English country life, keeping as 
far away from London, which he always abom- 
inated, as it was possible and still remain in 
England. And here he began the real work 
of his life. At Oaklands and at Lanrumney 
he had been by no means idle, but he had been 
as yet content to gather and lay the founda- 
tions for the greater work to come. He had 
produced much, but mostly in the way of re- 
view and criticism of the work of others. At 
Lanrumney he had devoted himself to the study

of Greek and Roman history. The series of 
reviews put forth at this time " exhibits a knowl- 
edge of Greek and Roman history marvellous 
in its extent, clearness and firmness of grasp, 
ranging as it does from the earliest ages down 
to his own day." Yet fame had come to him 
slowly. He was one of those luckless bodies 
whose fortune it was always to be just beaten 
by some more fortunate competitor. At the 
university he had tried for prizes and fellow- 
ships, and had generally succeeded in securing 
an honorable mention. He had tried twice or 
thrice for Parliament ; but he was too honest 
for the politicians, and too impatient in the 
presence of mediocrity or stupidity, ever to se- 
cure the favor of the common people. 

His ambition some day to return to his be- 
loved Oxford as a professor of history had 
never forsaken him, but neither had his ill-luck. 
In 1861 he had failed to secure the Camden 
Professorship of Ancient History, and in 1862 
he had likewise failed to secure the Chichele 
Professorship of Modern History. In the lat- 
ter case, thirty-five testimonials in his favor had 
been forwarded to the electors. Amongst them 
was one from Thirlwall, the learned Bishop 
of St. David's, who said : 

" I have much pleasure in stating that I not only con- 
sider him eminently fitted for the office, but that I 
should not be able to name any living scholar who ap- 
pears to me more highly qualified for it." (I., p. 308.) 

These various rebuffs to his ambition were, 
however, not without their beneficial results. 
Freeman had made a reputation as a reviewer. 
He had published a volume on Church Archi- 
tecture, and had also put out Volume I. of his 
" Federal Government "; but his name was not 
as yet, in the public mind, attached to any 
great work on modern history. It was time 
that he concentrated his splendid powers upon 
some one definite period of world history that 
should henceforth be recognized as peculiarly 
his own field. In 1865 he wrote to Dean Hook : 

" Goldwin Smith will most likely give up his profes- 
sorship next year, and I want to succeed him. It seems 
to be thought good that I should put out something more 
directly bearing on what they call Modern History than 
Federal Government, Vol. I. So, as Federal Govern- 
ment, Vol. II., could 'not be done in time, and as no 
bookseller (at least neither Longmans nor Macmillan) 
would take a volume of collected essays at his own risk, 
I have actually sat down to make a distinct History of 
the Norman Conquest, which I can do easier than any- 
body else, as I have worked so much at the subject for 
twenty years past, that is, a great part of the story; 
there will be little more to do than to write down what 
is already in my head." (I., 335.) 

The Norman Conquest was thus by no means 



a new subject. He had long been delving and 
gathering. In 1892 he said of a former un- 
successful effort to win a prize upon this sub- 
ject: 

" The Norman Conquest was a subject that I had 
been thinking about ever since I could think at all. I 
wrote for the Prize; I had the good luck not to get it. 
Had I got it I might have been tempted to think that 
I knew all about the matter. As it was, I went on and 
learned something about it." (P. 75.) 

This was, in 1846, one of the several unsuc- 
cessful attempts of Mr. Freeman to secure 
honors during his university career. But dis- 
appointment only stimulated him to deeper and 
more diligent study. Thus in a double sense, 
we are indebted to the disappointments of Mr. 
Freeman for his greatest work, " The Norman 
Conquest." Nor was he destined to succeed 
any better in 1866. When Goldwin Smith 
resigned, the coveted prize again eluded the 
ambitious recluse of Somerleaze and was given 
to his friend William Stubbs. The appoint- 
ment of Stubbs did much to rob Freeman's 
third disappointment of its edge. It was an 
honor to be beaten by such a competitor. In 
the mean time Freeman remained at Som- 
erleaze, quietly working away at the "Con- 
quest " and making himself generally useful, 
like the typical country gentleman that he was. 
" Gaols, lunatics, and meetings about cattle 
plague " claimed a due share of his time. The 
work on the " Conquest " also greatly broadened 
his scholarship by bringing him more into 
sympathy with German writers, and greatly 
strengthened that new taste for travel and local 
research which became so marked in his later 
years. In a letter written from Oaklands, in 
1854, he frankly confesses that he is not a 
German scholar, and in citing a list of author- 
ities upon mediaeval constitutional history he 
has apparently exhausted himself with " Hal- 
lam, Guizot, Palgrave, Kemble, and the like " 
(76V?., p. 171). In 1877 he could address the 
Greeks at Corfu in their native tongue ; he 
could write and talk Latin like a medieval 
chorister ; French also was as familiar to him 
as his native English ; but as late as 1871 he 
complains from Strasburg : 

" The folk at this inn be so Dutch that it was only 
with great pains that I could find out the time of the 
trains for Paris. You 're in Germany now ' says the 
waiter, in English." (II., p. 20.) 

In December, 1872, we find him patiently 
laboring through Waitz, whom he treats with 
great respect. Possibly this interest in Waitz 
had some connection with a visit to central 
Germany in the preceding summer when he

was the honored guest of Ihne at Heidelberg 
and of Pauli at Gottingen. 

Freeman's method of work at this time was 
first to gather and read all that he could find 
upon the topic in hand, and then to visit the 
region in question and study it on the spot. 
It was at such times that he laid his friends 
under tribute. Green, whose powers of observa- 
tion were far keener than Freeman's, was his 
frequent companion, especially in Normandy. 
A jolly pair they must have been, too, as they 
' footed it " about among the Norman hills, 
" stalking castles," making the best of the in- 
conveniences of such travel, finding no end of 
amusement and entertainment in the people, 
but always deprecating the " Gal- Welsh jabber 
that must come out of such fine Dutch car- 
cases." What would one not give to have their 
eyes and see what they saw and as they saw ! 
Switzerland, Freeman had already visited. 
Italy and Greece received his attention later. 
His " History of Sicily " led him to study its 
local topography as earnestly and faithfully as 
he had once studied Normandy. 

In 1881 a long-talked-of trip to America was 
undertaken. His ostensible object was to re- 
spond to the joint invitation of the Lowell Insti- 
tute of Boston and the Peabody Institute of 
Baltimore. But Freeman's historical studies 
had long since interested him in the Americans 
as the people who had most realized the prin- 
ciples of Federal Government. He came, there- 
fore, with eyes opened with kindly interest for 
the people and their institutions. He saw in 
them his kindred, and he loved and respected 
them as he did all that was English. His 
habit of constantly studying and comparing 
the history of England with the history of 
old Greece made it easy for him to grasp the 
idea of a people politically and geographically 
divided, but still remaining in the higher sense 
one people. It was in his large thought that 
the Englishmen of Britain, of America, of 
Africa, of Australia, should be each to his dis- 
tant brother as were the Greek of Kyrene and 
the Greek of Cherson. He regretted that there 
was no common name to embrace them all, such 
as the Greeks had in their term Hellene. The 
British Empire meant nothing to him com- 
pared with that truer and larger unity of the 
scattered English folk, the great family of the 
Angle-Kyn, who, in spite of geographical dis- 
tance, political separation, cruel warfare, and 
even more cruel commercial rivalry, were still 
one people in history, in language, in the 
possession of common political traditions, in 



religion, and in the consciousness of common 
destiny. Said he : 

"This great land is essentially an English land; it is 
no small witness to the toughness of fibre in the En- 
glish folk wherever it settles that it is so; a land must 
be reckoned as English where the English kernel is so 
strong as to draw to itself every foreign element, where 
the foreign settler is adopted into the English home of 
an English people, where he or his children exchange 
the speech of their elder dwellings for the English 
speech of the laud. Men of various nationalities are 
on American ground easily changed into good Ameri- 
cans, and the good American must be, in every sense 
that is not strictly geographical, a good Englishman. . . . 
Truly we may rejoice that with so much to draw them 
in other ways, this great people still remains in all essen- 
tial points an English people, more English very often 
than they themselves know, more English it may be 
sometimes than the kinsfolk whom they left behind in 
their older home." (II., p. 180. Quoted from " Im- 
pressions of United States," p. 137.) 

At last, in the year 1884, the honor for which 
Mr. Freeman had so long hoped in vain sought 
him. On the resignation of Mr. Stubbs to be- 
come bishop of Chester, Freeman was chosen 
to fill his place. One of the great objects of 
his ambition, in which he had been so often 
disappointed, was now at last within his grasp. 
But the prize had now lost its charm. He felt 
that the appointment was his due, and that he 
ought to accept it, but he shrank from the 
change in all his habits of life which must fol- 
low. There is a real pathos in the reply which 
he at the time makes to the congratulations of 
Mr. Goldwin Smith : 

" It is something to succeed Arnold, you, and Stubbs 
but I gnash my teeth that I have not had you and 
Stubbs to my colleagues and not to predecessors. Years 
ago to fill one of the historical chairs at Oxford was my 
alternative ambition with a seat in Parliament. It seemed 
for years as if neither would ever come to me ; and now 
at least one has come when I am rather too old for the 
change. Leaving one's home for half the year to be in 
the midst of the whirl of Oxford, as Oxford is now, is 
a frightful prospect, besides the bondage of new and 
absurd rules which Arnold never was under, nor you 
either. . . . Still, I should have been disappointed if I 
had not had the offer of the post, as I certainly thought 
it was my due; and I thought it right to take it." (II., 
279.) 

No one more than he knew his limitations. 
His health was failing rapidly. It was too late 
for the old dog to take kindly to new tricks. 
He clung fondly, pathetically, to the old hab- 
itat. He continues to Goldwin Smith : 

" I do n't mean to leave Somerleaze ; at least I shall 
try the experiment of keeping two houses, though I fancy 
it will be both grievous and costly; but I have got so 
fond of my own place that it would be a frightful 
wrench to leave it altogether." 

The results proved that Freeman had not 
misjudged himself, or his condition. He be-

longed to the generation past. He had little 
sympathy with the innovations that had dese- 
crated the Oxford that he had known and loved 
forty years before. He was out of place and 
he knew it and felt it. He who could have 
been so much to the university, saw himself 
now deserted for younger men. He lectured 
to empty benches, neither his style nor his 
methods were adapted to the ideals of the time. 

His studies in the mean time were not for 
one moment forsaken ; the first and second vol- 
umes of his "History of Sicily" were published 
in 1891, and by the end of the year nearly the 
whole of the third volume was ready for the 
press. In this great work, destined to be left 
unfinished, he found relief and consolation in 
the midst of the discouragement arid humilia- 
tion that clouded his professorial career. " I 
am a-weary," he writes in February, " of all 
this professing, and I shall be glad to give it 
up at the first moment I can." In March again 
he writes : 

" I am thoroughly tired of this place and everything 
in it. It is all so disappointing and disheartening. I 
have tried every kind of lecture I can think of, and 
put my best strength into all, but nobody comes, and all 
the petty things that turn up are just enough to dis- 
turb one's own steady work without awakening any in- 
terest." 

Freeman's failing health undoubtedly had 
much to do with the despondence that pervades 
all his letters of this period. Occasionally 
he writes in a tone of sadness and vexation 
of spirit, never manifested before in any for- 
mer period of his life. From Somerleaze he 
complains that few of his friends wrote to 
him, and that no one came to visit him ; and 
declares that if his friends did not go to see 
him, he certainly would not go to that hateful 
London, in which so many of them had buried 
themselves "that horrid wilderness of houses," 
more dreary to him than any other place in the 
world. At this time, also, he seems to be spe-

as if I had any spelling of my own different 
from Lappenberg and Kemble before me, and 
Johnny * after me." The critics also were ever 
grumbling at his "horrible repetition"; and

annoy me less if I saw more of other men and 
could talk and laugh them off, but I can't

NEW ENGLAND'S FAST DAYS.* 



The painful preparers and purveyors of per- 
ennial papers, to be printed throughout the 
press of this great United States, upon Thanks- 
giving Days, with historical reference to the 
day and to Fast Days, will hail with deep grat- 
itude the intelligent, comprehensive, exhaust- 
ive, and interesting book entitled " The Fast 
and Thanksgiving Days of New England." In 
it is fresh and varied material sufficient to fur- 
nish suggestions for scores of such papers, an 
excellent calendar of Fast and Thanksgiving 
Days, from the year 1620 to 1815, and a Bib- 
liography of Thanksgiving and Fast Sermons. 

In the book are set forth in a series of in- 
teresting and well laid out chapters, the condi- 
tions leading to the adoption in New England 
of the Fast Day and Thanksgiving Day system 
(if it may be so termed) in place of the holy 
days of the Church of England. The devel- 
opment of this system, and the reason of its 
decline, are also fully given. In various pe- 
riods, the system is shown in operation, in a 
series of pictures all in proper historical setting. 

As it would be impossible, within any rea- 
sonable space, to give any adequate review of 
the thirty long chapters that constitute this 
book, I will chiefly dwell on the chapter en- 
titled " The Conquest of Canada," since the 
subject chances to be of special prominence and 
interest to-day in the pleasant recognition and 
commemoration of this conquest through the

erection and dedication, by the Society of Col- 
onial Wars, of a monument in memory of the 
Battle of Louisburg. 

In the middle of the eighteenth century the 
conclusion was forced on New Englanders, 
through the Indian wars, that the conquest of 
Canada was essential to the continued peace of 
New England. It took two wars to obtain this 
conquest, " Governor Shirley's War," 1744 to 
1749, and the "French and Indian War," 
1755 to 1760. An attack was made on the 
English post of Canso in May, 1744, and when 
the news reached Boston, preparations were at 
once made both for fighting and praying. A 
Fast was held in Massachusetts and New 
Hampshire four days before the troops sailed 
for Annapolis Royal. Additional cause for 
humiliation was found in the warning voice of 
an earthquake, by which Boston was shaken 
the day after war was declared. The summer 
months were spent in endeavoring to secure 
the neutrality of the Indians, and the autumn 
Thanksgiving was given for the exceptionally 
bountiful harvest, upon which the ministers 
dilated as God's provision for war. The win- 
ter witnessed preparations for the expedition, 
and on the last day of February another Fast 
was held, and Samuel Checkley preached a ser- 
mon on " Prayer a Duty when God's People 
Go Forth to War." Bostonians had never 
neglected that duty ; they had prayed often and 
with " extraordinary fervency, faith, and wrest- 
lings," both in private and "solemn days of 
publick prayer." Praying-meetings were held 
even of women, a thing which had not been 
tolerated in Boston since the dangerous and 
" bussie-headed " meetings of Anne Hutchinson 
and her gossips a century previous. All this 
later agitation was in Whitefield's time, when 
prayer and praise filled every hour of the day. 
A fast was kept on May 2, after Sir William 
Pepperell and the " forces thro Favour of Di- 
vine Providence Were Embarked and De- 
parted." And it was learned afterward that 
while these good pious Bostonians were thus 
solemnly fasting and earnestly praying at home, 
that very hour the grand Battery of Cape Bre- 
ton was delivered up. On July 3 the good 
news of the fall of Louisburg arrived, and was 
greeted with fireworks and thanksgiving. 

The ministers and prayers had a large share 
in this Louisburg expedition. Rev. Samuel 
Moody, who accompanied the troops, cut down 
with his own hands the papal images in the 
Louisburg churches, and preached a Puritan 
sermon in the Romish church ; and it should 



be noted that prayer came nigh also to wreck- 
ing the expedition, for it was desired to be kept 
secret as long as possible, but a loud-voiced 
and fervent petition for guidance from God in 
the matter made the whole thing public. 

The following summer of 1746 was passed 
in alternate hopes and fears. A French fleet 
was said to be hovering off the coast near Bos- 
ton. The town was in consternation, a fast was 
set, and possibly in answer a tempest wrecked 
the French ships. In alternate fasting and 
thanksgiving passed the six years of the treaty 
of peace ; and then the second war arose, the 
war of Braddock's campaign. Well should 
New England now fast and pray ; burdened 
with debt, shocked by another earthquake, dis- 
couraged by Braddock's defeat, fasts followed 
rapidly and prayers filled the land. They were 
finally answered by the victory of Wolfe on the 
Heights of Abraham (a fireside tale in New 
England), and an English chaplain preached 
a Protestant sermon in the Ursuline convent 
in Quebec on the 27th of September. 

How England and New England rejoiced ! 
The autumn was a round of thanksgiving, of 
war-sermons, which now constitute an import- 
ant contribution to the history of the war. 
Some deemed the Conquest of Canada the final 
overthrow of Babylon. They cared little for 
Canadian territory, but were eager for the ban- 
ishment of the Roman Catholic religion from 
the continent. To me, these wars are deeply 
significant, for a reason which at that day would 
have seemed basely traitorous to the loyal hearts 
of both soldiers and ministers ; the struggle 
taught the sturdy Americans modes of war- 
fare, of fortifications, of endurance, and it pre- 
pared them for the struggle for Independence. 
But it was a bitter experience ; the hopeless 
campaigns in the fierce Canadian winters ; the 
sacrifices of wealth, of human life ; the hor- 
rors of Indian atrocities ; the tedious uncer- 
tainty of the issue. Well might they pray at 
the end and sing their " New Thanksgiving 
Song," printed in 1759. 

" With feasting and Thanksgiving 

Oar grateful hearts are fed, 
Which gratifies the Living 
And can 't offend the Dead." 

The story of all this has been well told by 
Mr. Love, and is of deep interest. Of scarcely 
less interest is the fantastic chapter on " Pests, 
Plagues, and Prodigies "; the one on " The 
Witch Craft Fasts "; and the amusing one on 
" Spells of Weather." For this book has much 
that is amusing in its pages. It shows many

aspects of the subject that are decidedly hu- 
morous, though always full of affectionate re- 
spect ; for the modes of thought which may 
appear whimsical to-day, two centuries ago were 
passionately religious and deeply significant. 
Mr. Layard tells us that when in pursuit of 
some antiquarian researches in the Orient, he 
asked a certain Eastern Cadi for assistance and 
information. He received this answer : " The 
things you search and ask, O most Illustrious 
Stranger and Joy of my Liver, are both im- 
possible and useless to accomplish." It would 
appear that it must be impossible to make a 
list of all the various fast and thanksgiving 
days observed in all the New England towns 
since colonial days, to recount their exact dates, 
their commemorative sermons ; yet I think it 
has not proved so. At any rate, the author 
gives in this book a table of about two thou- 
sand of these days, and I cannot believe there 
were many more. I personally know of some 
very out-of-the-way if I may so term them, 
some very recondite Fast Days, some appar- 
ently hidden and secreted instances. I have 
conferred with Mr. Love's list. They all are 
there, in proper place, properly dated, properly 
labelled. Whether this work is useless or not, 
is another matter. It would seem to be a mat- 
ter of individual decision. Certainly from the 
point of view of an antiquary or oniomaniac it 
would not appear that it was Love's Labor Lost.

CORRESPONDENCE OF A BRITISH 
CONSUL-GENERAL,.* 

The student of American history will find 
much of interest and value in a handsome vol- 
ume recently issued under the title of " Selec- 
tions from the Correspondence of Thomas Bar- 
clay." Thomas Barclay came of old colonial 
stock. His great-grandfather, John, was sur- 
veyor-general of East Jersey, and agent of his 
brother Robert, the non-resident governor ; 
Thomas, the son of John, was Church of En- 
gland missionary at the then (1707-22) out- 
post of Albany ; his son Henry was long rec- 
tor of Trinity Church, in New York, and to 
him, in 1753, was born the hero of the present 
book. The original Barclays were upper-class 
Scotchmen ; but the American branch, in its

BARCLAY, formerly British Consul-General at New York.

Brothers. 



four generations, married into Dutch families 
of the patroon order. Thus Thomas Barclay 
was a thorough - going Knickerbocker of the 
olden type, reared in an unyielding Church of 
England atmosphere, intensely loyal to his 
king, and of course an uncompromising Tory 
when the Ee volution broke out. In 1775 he 
married, and opened a law office in New York, 
but soon fled to rural Ulster ; but here he found 
life intolerable, amid suspicious neighbors to 
whom a loyalist was akin to a mad dog, and in 
1776 he joined the British army, fighting gal- 
lantly until the close of the war, from which 
he emerged as a major, on half-pay. The prop- 
erty of the Barclays, like that of hundreds of 
other loyalist estates, was sequestered to the 
Commonwealth of New York, and, exiled, the 
young lawyer-soldier went forth to drag out a 
few barren years in Nova Scotia, upon the 
shores of the Bay of Fundy. 

In 1796, it became essential to establish 
which of two streams emptying into the Bay 
was the true River St. Croix mentioned in Jay's 
boundary treaty of 1794. Barclay's local 
knowledge, added to the credit he had estab- 
lished at court, caused him to be selected as 
the king's commissioner, and his views appear 
to have prevailed in the council. In 1799 he 
returned to New York as British consul-gen- 
eral, a position he held until the outbreak of 
war in 1812 necessitated his retirement to 
England. He was soon back again, however, 
as agent for the relief and exchange of British 
prisoners in America, and in this often dis- 
agreeable position served until peace was de- 
clared, when he once more retired to London, 
only to be again despatched to New York as 
one of the British commissioners to settle the 
vexed question of the Northeast Boundary 
(1815-22). 

Barclay's position was now a peculiarly del- 
icate one. His editor well says : " He was a 
native of New York, he had married his wife 
in New York ; his family had their home there, 
his sons were New York merchants, his daugh- 
ters had married Livingstons and Stuyvesants, 
and he was a cousin of half the people in the 
place. Nova Scotia and Canada were sensitive 
on the subject, and if Lord Ashburton was 
attacked and discredited because he had mar- 
ried an American wife, we may guess what sort 
of a storm would have been raised if Barclay 
had yielded to American demands. Far more 
stubbornly, probably, than any native English- 
man, Barclay stood firm for the extremest Brit- 
ish claims." As a matter of fact, these pro- 



44 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



tracted negotiations availed nothing ; it was 
not until the Webster- Ashburton treaty in 1842 
that the matter was finally settled, by the es- 
tablishment of the present boundary. As for 
Barclay, he retired in 1822, after nearly fifty 
years of important public service for Great 
Britain, and spent his last years quietly and 
prosperously, in the care of a country place on 
Manhattan Island, where he passed away in 
1830. 

Barclay appears to have preserved but a rela- 
tively small portion of his correspondence, which 
must have been voluminous ; such papers as are 
here given us, however, are sufficient to throw 
many a strong ray of light upon the troublous 
affairs of the Republic in its years of childhood. 
Their author probably never quite forgave his 
fellow-countrymen for breaking with the mother 
country, and was to the last faithful, perhaps 
over-zealous, in his service for the King. But 
he thoroughly knew America and Americans, 
and his letters reveal none of those singular 
misconceptions of our national characteristics 
which were wont in his day to abound in the 
memoirs of English travellers and diplomats 
whose paths led hither. He drove hard bargains 
for his sovereign; nevertheless he had a whole- 
some respect for the land of his birth, its peo- 
ple, and most of its institutions. 

The editor of the present volume, Mr. George 
Lockhart Rives, is not only a descendant of 
Thomas Barclay, but was formerly assistant sec- 
retary of state of the United States, and betrays 
an intimate knowledge of early American diplo- 
macy. His introductions to the several chap- 
ters into which he has arranged the papers are 
in their way models of judicious and concise 
statement ; his own account of the northeast 
boundary question, reinforced by two original 
maps, is in itself a valuable contribution to the 
literature of the subject. The publishers have 
cooperated with the editor in the production of 
a highly creditable piece of book-making. The 
excellent index deserves special commendation 
from historical students.

THE LIFE OF A PHILANTHROPIC 
ENGLISHWOMAN.* 



Viewed from the standing-point of thrilling 
adventure or varied experiences, the Life of 
Miss Frances Power Cobbe would seem unevent- 
ful enough ; but as a record of the evolution of 
a strong personality, and of changes in English 
life and society during the past seven decades 
all of which she saw, and part of which she 
was, it holds the reader's attention from the 
first page to the last of its two large volumes. 

It is impossible to conceive a more dispas- 
sionate or franker narrative ; and this is per- 
haps the greatest charm of the book. Nothing 
either good or bad in the way of self -revelation 
appears to have been shirked ; and many of 
those things which most persons, especially 
most women, prefer to keep to themselves are 
stated here in a matter-of-course fashion that 
is a sure warrant of that perfect candor in self- 
judgment which is usually so difficult of attain- 
ment. For example, speaking gratefully of her 
own vigorous physique, Miss Cobbe admits its 
defects, " even to the verge of grotesqueness 
from the aesthetic point of view "; in describ- 
ing a childish temptation whereby she ate, one 
by one, certain sweetcakes placed in her care 
for a boy cousin, she adds : " Greediness, alas ! 
has been a besetting sin of mine all my life." 
But the most astonishing bit of confidential 
disclosure to the reader is where she speaks of 
having gone through life without any experi- 
ence of what has been styled " woman's whole 
existence," confessing that no man has ever 
desired to share her life, nor has she seen the 
man she would have wished to ask her to do 
so. This revelation makes it seem all the more 
astonishing that she could have entered into 
the understanding of the sentiments of love 
and maternity as she has done in " The Duties 
of Women." It denotes an intuitive imagina- 
tion of a high order to supply the sympathy 
that is commonly derived only by actual experi- 
ence in one's own fibres. 

By any of the recognized laws of heredity, 
Miss Cobbe is puzzled to account for herself. 
Not one of her ancestors or relatives, so far as 
she can learn, ever dabbled in printer's ink ; 
and so little sympathy had she at home that 
she was obliged to write and publish secretly, 
in order to spare her father the mortifying con- 
sciousness of having a scribbling daughter.

His own abilities, though not small, were exclu- 
sively of an administrative order. The mother 
was a gracious and beautiful woman, notable 
chiefly as a charming hostess and cultivated 
member of society. With a great admiration 
for both parents, and a passionate love for the 
mother, Frances Power Cobbe recognizes that 
her own faculties, her own lifework, are of a 
kind that would have been regarded as un- 
seemly by all her ancestry, and unbecoming as 
a daughter of their house, especially as she 
lacked the inheritance of all their peculiar gifts 
and graces. Of her four brothers, all her 
elders, none showed any marked fondness for 
literary pursuits. 

Destiny conferred upon Miss Cobbe a for- 
tunate environment. Being granted the proph- 
et's prayer of " neither poverty nor riches," she 
was freed from all the money cares that beset 
the pathway of most persons. Neither of those 
difficult problems, the making of both ends 
meet or the just and conscientious expenditure 
of a large income, were pressed upon her for 
solution. Thus in early womanhood and mid- 
dle life she enjoyed a degree of real leisure of 
mind possessed by few. This gift of the gods 
to the literary worker is so priceless that it is 
a pleasure to find Miss Cobbe recognizing its 
full value, even to the extent of somewhat de- 
preciating her real gifts and creative energy. 
She says : 

" I had good, sound working brains to start with, and 
much fewer hindrances than the majority of women in 
improving and employing them. Voila tout." 

A woman thus fortunately born and fortu- 
nately placed would naturally receive the best 
education offered by her time, and accordingly, 
at the age of fourteen Miss Cobbe left the care 
of governesses for a private " Ladies' School " 
in Brighton. The description of her life there 
during the next two years is one of the most 
entertaining portions of the book, as showing 
the characteristics of the typical higher educa- 
tion of women at that period. It is Miss 
Cobbe's deliberate conviction that, for attain- 
ing the minimum of solid results with the max- 
imum of cost and labor, a better system could 
scarcely have been devised. These were some 
of its features : 

" Not that which was good in itself or useful to the 
community, or even that which was delightful to our- 
selves, but that which would make us admired in so- 
ciety, was the raison d'etre of each requirement. Every- 
thing was taught us in the inverse ratio of its true 
importance. At the bottom of the scale were Morals 
and Religion, and at the top were Music and Dancing; 
miserably poor music too, of the Italian school then in 



vogue, and generally performed in a showy and taste- 
less manner on harp or piano. I can recall an amusing 
instance in which the order of precedence above de- 
scribed was naively betrayed by one of our schoolmis- 
tresses when she was admonishing one of the girls who 
had been detected in a lie. ' Don't you know, you 
naughty girl,' said Miss R. impressively, before the 
whole school, 'don't you know we had almost rather 
find you have a P [the mark of Pretty Well] in your 
music, than tell such falsehoods ? ' . . . They marched 
us to church every Sunday when it did not rain, and 
they made us on Sunday mornings repeat the Collect 
and Catechism; but beyond these exercises of body and 
mind it was hard for them to see what to do for our 
spiritual welfare. One Ash Wednesday, I remember, 
they provided us with a dish of salt fish, and when this 
was removed to make room for the roast mutton, they 
addressed us in a short discourse, setting forth the 
merits of fasting, and ending by the remark that they 
left us free to take meat or not as we pleased, but that 
they hoped we should fast; 'it would be good for our 

souls AND OUR FIGURES ! ' " 

By far the most vital and momentous of 
Miss Cobbe's experiences were those in con- 
nection with religious thought and feeling. Nat- 
urally a very devout child, when she was about 
eighteen she found herself, in complete mental 
solitude and in great ignorance, facing all the 
dread problems of human existence. Her father 
was a typical Churchman as Churchmen were 
in the first half of the century. All her rela- 
tives, far and near, were the same. In those 
days no such thing was heard of as " Broad " 
interpretations of Scripture doctrines. It was 
sixty years before " Lux Mundi," and thirty 
before even " Essays and Reviews." Evan- 
gelical Christianity in 1840 presented itself as 
a thing to be taken whole, or rejected wholly. 
The story of the alterations that for years went 
on in the poor young heart and brain, one week 
or month of rational and moral disbelief, and 
the next of vehement and remorseful return to 
the faith which she supposed could alone give 
her the joy of religion, is too pathetic and in- 
timate for condensation ; and the result of her 
final acceptance of the doctrines of Theism, 
with its family estrangement, is really tragic, 
but must not be dwelt upon here. 

In the year 1857, by the death of her father, 
Miss Cobbe was released from her pleasant du- 
ties as mistress of the family estate at New- 
bridge, and found herself free to enter upon an 
independent career of her own choosing. She 
was then thirty-five years old, had written one 
book, the " Essay on the Theory of Intuitive 
Morals," but had seen little of any life beyond 
that of her own immediate neighborhood. After 
the English fashion, the interests of the eldest 
brother and his charge of keeping up the house 
and estate were considered as paramount, and

she was left with but a small patrimony. But 
accepting her comparative poverty with cheer- 
fulness, and interpolating a year's pilgrimage 
abroad as a sort of conclusion to her self-edu- 
cation, the time seemed now ripe for realizing 
a long-cherished hope of leading an independ- 
ent life in some field of usefulness to her fel- 
low-creatures. " Slumming," before either the 
word or the thing had become fashionable, was 
the first thing that presented itself, and the 
next four years were spent assisting Miss Car- 
penter in her Reformatory and Ragged School 
work. Lameness, in consequence of a sprained 
ankle, terminated these labors ; and Miss 
Cobbe's work henceforth, though not less phil- 
anthropic, was performed chiefly through the 
medium of the pen. Two classes of the op- 
pressed women and brutes appealed espe- 
cially to her justice-loving nature, and inspired 
her to vigorous efforts in their behalf. Wo- 
man Suffrage, the Married Woman's Property 
Act, the granting of university degrees to wo- 
men, the protection of assaulted wives from 
brutal husbands, are all causes which have owed 
much to the voice and pen of Miss Cobbe. But 
it is in behalf of dumb animals, and as leader of 
the Anti- Vivisection movement, that her chief 
energies have been engaged during the last 
thirty years. Her article on " The Rights of 
Man and the Claims of Brutes," published in 
" Fraser's Magazine " of November, 1863, was 
probably the first effort ever made to deal with 
the moral question involved in the torture of 
animals, either for the sake of scientific or ther- 
apeutic research, or for the acquirement of man- 
ipulative skill. Now there are no less than 
fifty-seven Anti- Vivisection Societies in Europe 
and America, and the cause is recruiting new 
friends every day. Miss Cobbe gives it as her 
" supreme hope " that " when, with God's help, 
our Anti-Vivisection controversy ends in years 
to come, long after I have passed away, man- 
kind will have attained through it, a recogni- 
tion of our duties towards the lower animals, 
far in advance of that which we now commonly 
hold." 

Those who know Miss Cobbe as the author 
of books so eloquent and ringing as " The Du- 
ties of Women," so logical and scholarly as 
the " Essay on Intuitive Morals," so devout and 
helpful as " Religious Duty," so incisive and 
sprightly as Re-Echoes," will not delay long 
in seeking the acquaintance of an autobiogra- 
phy marked by all of these qualities.

MAYAN HIEROGLYPHICS.* 



Of the native peoples of North America, the 
Mayas had certainly made the greatest ad- 
vancement in culture and have left the most 
enduring and interesting monuments. At the 
time of the Spanish Conquest, the Mayas oc- 
cupied the whole of Yucatan and parts or all 
of the present states and countries of Chiapas, 
Tabasco, Guatemala, and Honduras. Mayas 
pure in blood and speaking their old language 
still form the main population of much of that 
area. The Maya language possesses remark- 
able vitality, and has not only not given way 
before the Spanish, but has forced itself upon 
the half-breed and foreign population of Yu- 
catan. 

The Mayas are " short, strong, dark, and 
brachycephalic." Not quite satisfied with na- 
ture's gifts, they formerly shaped their heads 
into curious forms and perforated or filed their 
teeth. Agriculturists, they raised crops of 
maize, beans, and peppers for food ; they cul- 
tivated cotton for clothing ; they raised bees 
for their wax and honey. Fond of bright col- 
ors in dress, they made much use of gay feath- 
ers, and dyed their cotton cloths brilliantly. 
They lived in permanent towns, wherein some 
of the buildings were built of stone and elab- 
orately carved. Their religious ideas were nota- 
bly developed and deeply influenced the daily 
life. 

Students have given much attention to the 
interesting architecture and the written system 
of the Mayas. Stephens and Catherwood half 
a century ago made known to the American 
reader the ruined cities in the forests of Chi- 
apas, Honduras, and Yucatan. They caused a 
veritable sensation. Yet for a long time, and 
until quite recently, American students made 
no further important explorations. Then the 
Peabody Museum at Cambridge began its work 
in Honduras ; later the management of the 
World's Columbian Exposition arranged for 
the photographing and reproduction of some 
of the more important monuments and ruins. 
At the Exposition not only all of this material, 
but also the important reproductions by Char- 
nay that enthusiastic French explorer were 
shown. Parts of finely carved faades, the 
Yucatanese Arch, mural decorations and in- 
scriptions, altars, great monolithic figures, tab-

called " calculif orm" or pebble-shaped. Though 
much conventionalized in some cases, they are 
plainly pictorial in origin. The inscriptions 
on walls and monoliths are not the only speci- 
mens of Mayan writing. There are some brief 
inscriptions on small objects, on stone, and on 
vases of earthenware. There are also a few 
books. 

The books of the Mayas were long strips of 
paper made of maguey fibre, which were folded 
like a screen. Upon the pages thus formed 
were painted in black and various colors strange 
pictures and characters of the same sort as 
those engraved on the monuments. Most of 
the Maya books were early destroyed by the 
Spaniards, but a few still exist in libraries and 
museums. Of those known, four have been 
accurately reproduced for the use of students. 

In his " Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphics," 
Dr. Brinton aims to summarize present knowl- 
edge of this curious system of writing. The 
work of German, French, English, and Ameri- 
can authors is collected, examined, and weighed. 
The number of American workers in the field of 
translating the Mayan hieroglyphs is not great. 
Cyrus Thomas, Philip Valentine, Aug. Le 
Plongeon, and Dr. Brinton are the ones whose 
writings are best known. Authors are not 
agreed upon very many important points. Thus 
the question whether the characters are pho- 
netic is still discussed. Some, by means of 
Landa's " alphabet " and other " keys " translate 
everything. Others go so far as to say that 
everything is pictographic and that phonetic 
characters are wanting. Dr. Brinton occupies 
a moderate position between these extremes. 
Considering the system as a whole, in its ori- 
gin, pictographic, he finds many of the char- 
acters to be of the nature of rebuses. At first 
pictures representing real objects, they have 
come to represent sounds derived from or sug- 
gested by the name of the original object. 

In the material studied there are three groups 
of elements recognized mathematical, pic- 
torial, graphic. The first group, the charac- 
ters connected with number, is important. In 
their peculiar way the Mayas were great mathe- 
maticians. With a vigesimal system of count- 
ing, they had distinct names for the various 
orders of numerals up to the sixth power of 
twenty. Forstemann, who in this matter is fol- 



lowed by Brinton, claims that this mathemati- 
cal knowledge was chiefly of service in religio- 
astronomical computations. The pictorial ele- 
ments are mainly representations of gods or of 
sacred objects. In identifying them, Schellhas 
has been a chief worker. Brinton summarizes 
his work, adding pertinent suggestions. The 
mathematical and pictorial elements, now fairly 
worked out, form a considerable part of the 
Mayan inscriptions and texts. The remainder 
the real graphic elements presents great 
difficulty. The signs of days, months, and car- 
dinal points are known ; the names of some 
gods have probably been made out. Most of 
the rest remain unconquered. In studying 
them, the characters, most of which are com- 
posite, must be analyzed into their component 
parts ; the original picture meaning of these 
must be determined ; lastly their rebus value, 
or sound, must be discovered. The work will 
be arduous, but it will probably be done. Dr. 
Brinton's " Primer " will help on the work. It 
supplies the beginner with just what he needs, 
information as to what and how much others 
have really gained. FREDERICK STARR. 



THROUGH ASIA AT MY STUDY TABLE.* 

The great central plateau of the Asiatic continent 
offers to the explorer irresistible attractions. An 
area nearly as large as all Europe is lifted higher 
than any other continental mass of the earth ; so 
that it has been called " the roof of the world." 
The rim of this plateau is fortified by ranges of 
lofty mountains upon three of its four sides ; the 
summits of those upon the south reaching an elevation 
but little short of six miles, while their practicable 
passes carry the daring traveller some thousands of 
feet higher than the dome of Mont Blanc. To the 
extreme vicissitudes of climate which such geograph- 
ical conditions necessarily impose, are added the 
suspicious and unfriendly disposition of inhabitants

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



unaccustomed to the incursions of visitors, and a 
general unwillingness of the governments to admit 
foreigners, amounting in some instances to absolute 
prohibition. 

The condition of isolation which the oriental na- 
tions have so long maintained, and which some of 
them yet strenuously insist upon, may be figured, 
not inaptly, by the physical situation just described. 
Elevated, in their own opinion, far above all other 
races or peoples, they have entrenched themselves 
within walls of opinion or of prejudice as massive 
as their mountains, and moving as slowly as their 
glaciers. Having outlived many more active and 
progressive nations, it may not be surprising that 
they should imagine stability of government to be 
synonymous with perpetuity of custom ; and that 
they should think it therefore necessary to resist 
all innovations of persons or of ideas. For genera- 
tions, progress knocked at the gates of isolation, 
but gained no admission. By a display of courteous 
power, Japan, already ripe for change, was induced 
to open her doors ; in response to the imperious de- 
mands of war, China has reluctantly done the same ; 
Korea and Siam and Burmah conform in a more 
kindly fashion. But Great Tibet sits within her 
circumvallation of mountains and deserts, beyond 
the range of gunboats or gatlings, and refuses ad- 
mission to a single feringhee scout, either traveller 
or missionary. Her contention is that every visitor 
will be followed by a score ; and that the gates once 
opened, the isolation so carefully preserved for cen- 
turies will be irrevocably destroyed. No occidental 
may visit Lassa, or even enter Tibet ; the native who 
aids such a visitor, or who even brings a request for 
admission, no matter in what respectful terms it may 
be couched, parts company with his head. 

Of the books of travel upon our list, four describe 
assaults upon the great central plateau and its some- 
what isolated people ; the other three present views 
within lands which have lately given admission to 
the stranger. Dr. Lansdell, who gives to the ac- 
count of a long and most successful journey, full of 
interest and adventure, the modest title of " A Ride 
to Little Tibet," unites in himself the characteris- 
tics of a traveller, a naturalist, and a pioneer of 
Christian missions. As the result of preceding jour- 
neys, he has described the northern or Siberian 
Asia, and that part of Central Asia which is gov- 
erned by Russia. In this journey it was his pur- 
pose to visit that part of Central Asia which is in- 
cluded in the Chinese Empire, although without the 
great wall. He so arranged his route as to enter 
this region, as he himself says, by the "back way" 
that is, from the west, crossing the Russian fron- 
tier, rather than by making the journey from the 
Chinese seaboard. As his friends deemed this pro- 
cedure extra-hazardous, they endeavored to dissuade 
him from it ; but by skilful approaches to the gov- 
ernments of China and of Russia, supported by his 
reputation already established with each, and aided 
by the kind offices of the British diplomatic and 



consular service, he was enabled so to conduct his 
travel as to relieve it of every inconvenience not im- 
posed by natural causes. Under instructions which 
everywhere preceded him, officers were on the alert 
to anticipate his wants. His goods passed frontiers 
not simply free of duty but free of inspection ; quar- 
ters, servants, and transportation were freely pro- 
vided, and even the postal service followed him to 
the heart of Asia. What with stalking deer and 
shooting wild asses, and gathering butterflies to make 
an entomologist green with envy, his collections in 
natural history seem to have been limited only by 
his means of transportation. With all this, it should 
be noted that other interests were constantly sub- 
ordinated to the great errand on which he had come, 
which' was to make reconnaissances for suitable points 
for missionary stations, and to distribute translations 
of the Scriptures in lands where they were before 
unknown. These he found everywhere gladly re- 
ceived, the people offering large prices for books, 
when the supplies allotted for free distribution in 
specified localities were exhausted. 

Moving rapidly, as modern conveyances permit, 
from London by way of St. Petersburg and the 
Black and Caspian seas, his first objective point 
was Kuldja, southeast of Lake Balkash, and north 
of the Thian Shans. Thence scaling its northern 
boundary by the Musart Pass, at an altitude of 
12,000 feet, he entered the high basin of Chinese 
Turkestan, where he established himself at Kashgar, 
a point nearly north from Bombay. Here, thirty 
years ago, the Mohammedan chieftain, Yakub Kham, 
made against the Chinese Empire a revolt, briefly 
successful but after a time suppressed, which had 
its use in admitting a ray of modern daylight into 
a secluded region. Having completed his inspection, 
and visited Yarkand and Khotan, cities yet but little 
known, Dr. Lansdell continued his journey south- 
ward, crossing in succession the lofty ranges of the 
Kuen-lun, the Karakorum, and the Himalayahs, by 
passes each of which had an altitude of more than 
17,000 feet. The beast of burden available at these 
great elevations, where horses and men suffer from 
the rarefaction of the air, is the yak, described as 
" a grunting ox with a horse's tail." It proved to 
be sure-footed and easily ridden along precipitous 
paths of alpine abruptness, encroached upon by 
glaciers of more than Arctic grandeur. The route 
finally emerged into Kashmir, in that part called 
Little Tibet, which gave the title to Dr. Lansdell's 
book. Great Tibet he could not enter. No diplomacy 
from England or from China availed anything. An 
autograph letter addressed to the Grand Lama by 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom Dr. Lansdell 
described as the Chief English Lama, failed for 
want of delivery. From Bhotan, from Leh, from 
Darjeeling, he could only look over into the forbid- 
den land, which he could not enter. 

The route which Mr. Shoemaker proposed to fol- 
low in the country somewhat indefinitely named by 
him Trans-Caspia, was a little less circuitous than 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



that taken by Dr. Lansdell, though directed to 
nearly the same objective points. So far as Tash- 
kend, they were the same ; thence he went toward 
Kashgar by the passes of the Alai mountains, rather 
than by the long detour by the Issik-Kul lake, and 
the town Kuldja. From Kashgar he proposed to 
enter Kashmir by Leh and the passes of the Kara- 
korum. Mr. Shoemaker had nearly reached Kash- 
gar when his farther progress was arrested by fever 
so serious as to require him to retrace his steps and 
regain the railway at Samarkand. The narrative, 
scarcely more than the introductory chapter of what 
was designed, is pleasantly written, but subjectively 
rather than objectively. 

The scene of Mr. Ballantine's excursion is upon 
the southern slope of the Himalayas. Along this 
portion of the impregnable defense of Great Tibet 
lies a fringe of mountainous country, a strip of ter- 
ritory five hundred miles long by one hundred and 
fifty wide, yet unsubdued by the East Indian gov- 
ernment, and named Nepal, from the ascetic Hin- 
doo saint, Ne. The frontier of Nepal is reached 
at a point near Segowli, distant by rail from Cal- 
cutta four hundred miles, and from Khatmandu, 
the capital, about one hundred miles. The road is 
merely a track through the jungle, not passable by 
vehicles, patrolled by dangerous wild beasts ; the 
traveller must provide his own equipment for camp- 
ing at night. The city occupies a picturesque sit- 
uation between the spurs of the mountains. No 
one could expect other than mediaeval types ; great 
wealth existing in temples and shrines, little for the 
daily life of the people. Edifices for religious pur- 
poses exhibit an impressive architecture of Indian 
style, profusely enriched, especially with quaintly 
artistic carvings. The most startling event at the 
time of our traveller's visit was a change in the gov- 
ernment, accomplished in the oriental fashion by 
the assassination of the prime minister and his gen- 
eral-in-chief of the army. 

The next anabasis is one undertaken from the 
East, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, by William Woodville Rockhill, previously 
of the American Embassy at Peking. The objective 
point was the exploration of part of the great Asian 
plateau, Great Tibet, and a visit to Lassa or, as 
he spells it, Lh'asa the capital city of the grand 
lama. The route chosen was westward from Pe- 
king, to the vicinity of the lake, Kokonor ; thence 
over the high lands inhabited by the Mongols of the 
Kokonor, to the Tengrinor, where he would be 
within a few days' march from Lassa. The journey 
was conducted as a scientific excursion, rather than 
as a summer excursion, and the narrative is given 
in the same spirit. The route is laid down with 
instrumental precision ; altitudes, temperatures, the 
weather, are carefully noted ; observations are re- 
corded whenever they have any bearing upon zoolog- 
ical, ethnological, or allied natural science. The 
record forms a valuable contribution to the geog- 
raphy of that part of Asia which was traversed. 



The reader will sympathize with the regret of the 
traveller when he found that the decision of the 
grand lama was consistent with previous refusals, 
and that he would be compelled to turn again east- 
ward and conclude his journey at Shanghai. Some 
time may yet elapse before any correspondent will 
date his letters at Lassa. 

Since the publication of the voluminous work of 
Dr. Williams, we have seen no presentation of China 
and its people more admirable than that of Mr. 
Chester Holcombe. One hardly needs to say that 
the Real Chinaman will not be discerned by the 
most astute tourist whose daily observations fall 
within daily changing horizons. For such a writer, 
the mental vision, like the physical, sees simply what 
is before it, is limited by its own aperture, and 
usually discovers only what it is looking for. His 
narrative describes himself as affected by novel 
conditions. It shows what the reader, if a person 
similarly constituted, would be likely to find on a 
similar journey. The vision may be truthfully pre- 
sented, but it is partial, superficial, and misleading 
in every important generalization. Especially in 
oriental lands, where all the elements of life, char- 
acter, education, art, are so strangely different from 
those which have developed the occidental mind, is 
it necessary that the observer should have the op- 
portunity given only by extended residence and inti- 
mate acquaintance, before his senses and his thoughts 
shall have adjusted themselves to the strange atmos- 
phere, and he be enabled to discover the real meaning 
of even everyday occurrences. Considering the wide 
gulf between oriental and occidental ideas, and the 
usually limited means for proper study, it is doubt- 
less true that " the rule in Western lands is to mis- 
understand everything Chinese." Mr. Holcombe 
has made skilful use of the singular advantages of 
his position as interpreter to the American legation 
at Peking, and afterward as secretary and acting 
minister. His work is concise, luminous, and of 
rare interest. China is a complete, coherent, and 
comprehensive organism. It is an Endogens. Its 
ideal assumes that every possible condition, social, 
religious, and political, has been recognized, ana- 
lyzed, and regulated, both as to substance and eti- 
quette. Revision is needless, alteration impossible. 
Education means the absorption by the memory of 
the entire regulative code, as it was long since form- 
ulated and expounded. The matter to be learned 
is, like the language, so wide in its scope and so 
infinitely multifarious in detail that a long life is 
too brief for its perfect mastery. Its political sys- 
tem is the r&ductw ad absurdam of what in the 
western world is the apotheosis of civil service. 
The unit is the family, in which the father is an 
autocrat ; the son is a vassal ; the daughter is nil. 
The son never becomes " of age "; during his father's 
life he may not plant a separate family tree. The 
state is the larger family of which the emperor is 
the paternal head. As he is the supreme father, the 
fibres of his absolute control permeate the mass of

hundreds of millions of people, and unite him per- 
sonally with the humblest subject, who may not even 
exchange his winter garments for his summer garb 
without permission from the vicegerent of heaven. 
Towards the highest power, next to that of the em- 
peror, any boy in the empire may aspire ; the route 
lies through a limitless jungle of education, and is 
marked by endless fences of examination. Like its 
most famous pagoda, the Chinese system is sym- 
metrical, consistent, finished, and lifeless. There 
is no place for foreign men or alien thought. There 
may be no migration, either inwards or outwards. 
The Chinese educated gentleman is like one of his 
choicest porcelain vases : elegant in form, polished 
in surface, artistic in its own way, unchangeable, 
and hollow. The china bowl floating beside the 
iron pot upon the swollen tide cried " Keep away, 
for I am precious "; and she might have added 
fragile. Considered as to its own premises, the at- 
titude which China has assumed toward the rest of 
the world is logically correct. The premises are 
deficient, for they ignore the indispensible element 
of vitality. The irresistible logic of events is driv- 
ing her on. Whether collision come against the 
elegant bronze of Japan, or the rougher iron of 
Russia or of England, the porcelain vase of China 
is in imminent danger. 

From China to Korea Cho-sen, the Land of 
the Morning Calm the transition is natural. Upon 
Korean soil came the first collision between isola- 
tion, as championed by China, and the youthful 
virility of progress, as illustrated by rejuvenated 
Japan. So much, at least, has been gained by the 
struggle, whose outcome as yet does not clearly ap- 
pear, that this land has been opened to the inspec- 
tion of the world ; and of this opportunity Mr. Sav- 
age-Landor has taken early advantage. In his brief 
visit he has seen much, which he has described in- 
structively. 

Whoever may have glanced at the volumes under 
consideration will have traversed in imagination the 
wide continent of Asia. With Shoemaker he has 
stifled in the hot sands of the Black desert; with 
Lansdell has chased butterflies in the glades beneath 
the Thian Shan, and struggled on yak-back over the 
glaciers of the Saser Pass ; with Ballantine has gazed 
at the gorgeous shrines near Khatmandu ; with Rock- 
hill has turned sadly away from inhospitable Tibet; 
with Holcombe has enjoyed a clear glimpse of Chi- 
nese political and social economy ; and with Savage- 
Landor has scampered through Korea. He would 
not willingly emerge from the glamour and the mys- 
tery of Asiatic communion, without a look at that 
farthest and fairest land where the East clasping 
hands with the West, joins the completed circuit of 
the world. With Mr. Finck this will be a rapid but 
pleasant journey. We shall see the lovely land in 
its loveliest garb of Lotus-time. The places will be 
familiar ; for have we not, by proxy, visited all be- 
fore ? the foreign drink-bars of Yokohama, and the 
bright streets of Tokyo ; ancient Nikko, with its tor- 



rents and temples, its gay bridges and its sombre ave- 
nues of cryptomerias ; modern Sapporo, where a col- 
lege of agriculture, founded by Americans and taught 
by Americans, rejoices in Jersey cows and the United 
States dialect; Hakodate, Kyoto, and imperial Fuji- 
san, are any of these new to us ? But the fresh 
visit with so versatile a companion will be not less 
delightful than were its predecessors. And if we, 
like him, have come with a purpose to see what we 
were looking for, we shall agree that in many respects 
Japan can show to us bustling Americans rare and 
worthy lessons in civilization of the highest type; 
such as kindly love for little children and reverent 
care of parents; real politeness, the cherished vin- 
tage of a thousand years; a language without pro- 
fanity ; genuine altruism, and the purest and most 
unselfish patriotism. Even Shinto virtues are not 
to be despised ; they are, cleanliness, courage, cour- 
tesy, personal honor, patriotism : against such there 

is no law - SELIM H. PEABODT. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Some beautiful Mrs. William Starr Dana's "How 
new books about to Know the Wild Flowers " (Scrib- 
American flowers. ner ) seems to have proved a distinct 
success, the title-page of the revised and enlarged 
edition now published announcing the twenty-sev- 
enth thousand of the work. In this edition there 
are fifty-two new plates, making the whole number 
of flowers pictured one hundred and sixty -four. 
Some sixty new descriptions have also been added, 
and many of the old ones amplified. The drawings 
are, with two or three exceptions, made directly from 
nature by Miss Marion Satterlee. A work of similar 
character and larger scope is the " Wild Flowers 
of the North-Eastern States " (Putnam), which has 
been prepared (both text and drawings) by Miss 
Ellen Miller and Miss Margaret Christine Whiting. 
This work, we understand, was undertaken some 
time before the appearance of Mrs. Dana's book, 
and its preparation has been a labor of years. Three 
hundred and eight species are included, each having 
a page of descriptive text and a full-page plate in 
illustration thereof. The most distinctive feature 
of the work is found in the fact that each drawing 
(with two or three exceptions) gives us the exact 
dimensions of the specimen from which it was taken. 
If the plant is large, like Acorns Calamus, we have 
only the section that the page will admit ; if it is 
small, like Viola sagittata, we have an equally 
small drawing set in the midst of a great blank 
space. The carrying out of this idea made a large 
page necessary, and hence the volume is a bulky 
one. Anyone familiar with our wild flowers does 
not need to be told that the drawings for the pres- 
ent work have been made with great and loving 
care, but the following note from the introduction 
is of interest : " Days have been pleasantly spent in 
searching for a specimen which would show most

typically the particular trick of growth, the charac- 
teristic gesture which individualized it from all 
other plants ; often a flower has been drawn and 
described as it grew, surprised in its familiar haunt." 
An Ariscema dracontium, slightly conventionalized, 
makes a beautiful and striking cover-decoration for 
this handsome volume. Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews, 
in his " Familiar Flowers of Field and Garden " 
(Appleton), has prepared a book to be read rather 
than referred to, and a charming book it is. The 
drawings are shaded instead of being the mere out- 
line sketches of the two books just described, and 
the artist has been extremely successful in getting 
the characteristic pose of his specimens. The de- 
scriptive text is accurate in fact and engaging in 
style. A peculiar point of excellence is found in 
the author's color-vocabulary, which shows how the 
eye of the painter may be enlisted, and to good pur- 
pose, in the service of science. Mr. Mathews is not 
the only student of botany who has been compelled 
to admit that Gray's descriptions are often inaccu- 
rate as far as color is concerned. The grouping of 
species in this book is by months, and an extensive 
tabular index (with floral calendar) is appended. 
The last book in our list is by Mr. Clarence Moores 
Weed, and is called " Ten New England Blossoms 
and Their Insect Visitors " (Houghton). As the 
title indicates, the main interest of the book centres 
in fertilization, and the author has brought numer- 
ous curious observations of his own to the store ac- 
cumulated by his predecessors. The subject is 
always fascinating, and Mr. Weed brings it easily 
within the comprehension of the general reader. 
His illustrations, at least the larger ones, are repro- 
ductions of photographs. 



Mr. Dana's 



" The Art * Newspaper Making " 
essays on " News- (Appleton) is a small volume into 

paper Making." which haye been gat h ere( J three lec . 

tures by the veteran Mr. Charles A. Dana. The 
lectures are entitled " The Modern American News- 
paper," " The Profession of Journalism," and "The 
Making of a Newspaper Man." That they are both 
readable and instructive goes without saying. Mr. 
Dana knows his subject and knows how to write 
entertainingly about it. He comes out strong upon 
the ethics of journalism, and even goes so far as 
to formulate a code for the profession. The jour- 
nalistic principles thus enunciated are for the most 
part praiseworthy indeed, but those who have stud- 
ied the way in which the " Sun " practises these 
principles may possibly be led to think of the " no- 
ble sentiments " of Joseph Surface. As was to be 
expected, Mr. Dana, with the usual phrases about 
" getting all the news," and " feeling the popular 
pulse," defends the modern practice of pandering to 
the instincts of the vulgar, and of printing accounts 
of all sorts of occurrences over which it were best 
to draw the veil of reticence. " I have always felt," 
he says, " that whatever the Divine Providence per- 
mitted to occur I was not too proud to report." 
Of course the real motive of such a policy is to " sell 



papers," as, for the rest, Mr. Dana frankly enough 
admits. " If any one newspaper regularly omitted 
to give an account of interesting swindles, or for- 
geries, or murders, the people would stop reading 
that paper and go off and get one where they could 
find all the news." This is the old plea of " I am 
no worse than the other fellows," and it is as vicious 
in journalism as it is anywhere else. But few 
among journalists, we fancy, would have the sub- 
lime effrontery of Mr. Dana in introducing the Di- 
vine Providence as a witness for the defence. We 
do not care to criticize these lectures in detail. Mr. 
Dana could not be expected to write any kind of a 
book without introducing a slur upon President 
Cleveland ; in the present instance the slur is both 
uncalled for and in the worst of taste. The arrange- 
ment of the newspaper hierarchy which places the 
editor at the head of things, calling him " the final 
authority in everything," ignores the publisher, who 
is too often the real head of a newspaper, working 
the strings of the puppet-editor from the counting- 
room. Mr. Dana's examples of newspaper poetry 
are not likely to become classics, and are perhaps 
best described in the phrase which calls them " as 
good an article in that line as ever has been pro- 
duced in the past." 

One of the discoveries of the most 
iwrcK Hamlet, modern Shakespearian criticism is to 

the effect that certain of the perplex- 
ing scenes in Hamlet had their origin in the desire 
for an effect not so much tragic as comic. This idea 
seems very modern indeed ; it gives the mediaeval 
mind a dazed sort of feeling, mingled with its nat- 
ural contempt for newfangled notions. "What, what, 
what ! " says Grandpa ; " do you mean to say that 
Shakespeare meant to make us laugh in that won- 
derful scene between Hamlet and Ophelia ? Did he 
think we should find something Fallstaffian in the 
awful utterances of the Ghost? Is Hamlet's mad- 
ness only a bit for the low comedian ? That may be 
well enough for the higher criticism, but as far as 
I can see, it's no more than the most arrant non- 
sense." It is not long ago that Mr. Wendell informed 
the world of Shakespearian scholars that Mr. John 
Corbin (now "of Harvard and Oxford") was pre- 
pared to maintain some such thesis as that indicated 
above, and not long afterward appeared Mr. Cor- 
bin's book itself "The Elizabethan Hamlet" (im- 
ported by Scribners). It is a very interesting little 
book. For some time it has been an idea of the stu- 
dents of " quellengeschichten " that a good deal could 
be found out concerning the lost play of Hamlet, 
which, as we know from various bits of evidence, 
was in existence some ten years or more before the 
Shakespearian Hamlet was written. The story it was 
written from is known ; two plays are also known 
for which it presumably furnished the original 
Shakespeare's Hamlet and a German play. One 
would say that we should be able to get something 
of a notion of the play itself. This is the basis of 
Mr. Corbin's study, which is well carried out, but his

idea is not merely a bit of reconstruction ; his chief 
intention is to bring forth something that will make 
a little less remarkable some of the difficulties and 
inconsistencies which have arisen in the study of 
Hamlet and which indeed seem to belong to the play 
itself. The book makes it pretty clear that in the 
old play there was a comic strain which, according 
to the humor of the time, included much that to us 
would not be comic at all, that there is a good deal 
of the old tragedy left in the Hamlet we are famil- 
iar with, and finally that some rather perplexing 
things in the modern Hamlet may be traced to this 
source. These are interesting points, and Mr. Cor- 
bin sustains them sufficiently by the various means 
at the disposition of the student of the Elizabethan 
drama. The book is a good example of a study in 
literary sources that is of really practical use in mak- 
ing some masterpiece more comprehensible. 



Three figures 
in American 
literature. 



That part of the public who believe 
that America, if she has not yet 
reached her intellectual golden age, 
has at any rate evolved a written product which 
should excite the interest of all her loyal sons, will 
welcome a new book by Professor Moses Coit Tyler, 
called "Three Men of Letters" (Putnam), and 
issued between two important epochs in his monu- 
mental history of our literature. George Berkeley, 
hitherto greeted mainly as the author of " West- 
ward the course of empire takes its way," here ap- 
pears as the philanthropic idealist who would have 
dedicated this nation in its early day to learning 
and religion, by means of the mammoth university 
which Walpole's politic but broken promise failed 
to support with financial aid. President Dwight of 
Yale is depicted as the ascetic student seeking men- 
tal liberation through starvation of body, and as the 
author of the imitative pastoral poem, " Greenfield 
Hill." " The Columbiad." one of our early would-be 
epics, far greater in conception than in execution, 
is described in connection with the ambition, the 
self-complacency, and the miscellaneous avocations 
of its author, Mr. Joel Barlow. It is profitable to 
see these figures against the background of contem- 
porary Europe, to know that Swift's "Vanessa" 
left Dean Berkeley a cozy legacy, that the amiable 
Cowper criticised Dwight's inevitable epic and 
praised one of his sermons, that Barlow, in the 
troublous time of the Reign of Terror, was made a 
French citizen by the National Convention. Such 
unexpected historical encounters, together with the 
author's pure style, his lurking humor, his occasional 
tone of mild satire not preventing full and cordial 
appreciation, make the little book delightful to read 
and a charming earnest of greater things to come. 

The study of crime and the criminal 
!* now popular. Within a few 
years a whole literature in Crimin- 
ology or Criminal Anthropology (the latter an un- 
fortunate term) has grown up. In the book before 
us, "The Female Offender," by Caesar Lombroso 



and William Ferreri, we have the first volume in a 
" Criminology Series " (Appleton). There may be 
question as to the wisdom of greatly " populariz- 
ing " the subject. Everyone would promptly ad- 
mit that judges, lawyers, teachers, leaders of all 
kinds, ought to know the recent studies upon crim- 
inals, and to fully realize that " born criminals " 
exist, that degeneration in physical structure and 
mental endowment often accompany and evidence 
moral imbecility, and that many a criminal is only 
an unfortunate and irresponsible being. But it is 
certain that too much multiplication and populariz- 
ation of these ideas will remove the feeling of re- 
sponsibility from weak but normal or from slightly 
abnormal natures and lead to much unnecessary 
crime. Whether a " criminology series " work good 
or harm depends much upon its editor. The 
Messrs. Appletons have been fortunate in their choice 
of Mr. W. Douglass Morrison for so delicate a task. 
His introductory chapter to this volume is one of 
the clearest and simplest presentations of the claims 
of criminology in any language. As for the book 
itself, it considers woman as Lombroso's Uomo De- 
linquente (Criminal Man) considered man. The 
woman criminal is studied physically and mentally. 
The work has most of the strong and weak points 
of its predecessor, but, on the whole, is more cau- 
tious and conservative. After analysis of the crim- 
inal woman, a synthesis of elements is made and 
several types are studied the born criminal, the 
occasional criminal, the criminal of passion, and 
hysterical and epileptic criminals. The publishers 
have done their part well, but we must regret the 
wretched system of numbering and referencing the 
rather poor plates which illustrate the work. The 
editor might properly have improved here upon the 
customary slipshod methods of the famous author. 

A fascinating ac- N . other P hase of nineteenth-century 
count of the "Lib- history offers so tempting a theme 
eration of Italy." f or historical treatment as the Italian 
Risorgimento. The right man for the task has not 
yet appeared, and perhaps the time is not quite ripe 
for his appearance, but when he comes he will find 
ready to his hand a story no less interesting than 
that of the French Revolution, the English Com- 
monwealth, or the repulse of the Persian by the 
Greek. Meanwhile, the story has been outlined by 
a number of writers, although such treatment as it 
has yet received, even at the hands of Reuchlin, is 
obviously provisional. In English, three attempts 
to tell the story have been made : that of Mr. John 
Webb Probyn, clean-cut and matter-of-fact ; that of 
Mr. William Roscoe Thayer, sympathetic but ver- 
bose ; and that of the Countess Martinengo-Cesar- 
esco, called "The Liberation of Italy, 1815-1870," 
and just now published in the " Events of Our Own 
Time " series (Scribner). The author has had pecu- 
liar advantages in the preparation of this work. She 
has known many of the Italian leaders, has had ac- 
cess to a great number of unpublished documents, 
and has visited the scenes of most of the events 



1895.]

The fifth issue 

of the 

" Yellow Book. 



chronicled. On this latter point, she writes: "I 
am familiar with almost all the places where they 
occurred, from the heights of Calatafimi to the un- 
happy rock of Lissa." This has given her the 
advantage that Curtius had in writing the history 
of Greece, and Colonel T. A. Dodge in describing 
the battles of his " Great Commanders." Inspired 
throughout by intense sympathy for the Italian 
cause, and written from abundant knowledge in an 
attractive style, this book may be read as one reads 
a novel, and with interest equally unabated. 

" The Yellow Book " has been made 
the victim of a good deal of abuse 
on account of its decadent tendencies 
in both literature and art, the abuse, although ex- 
travagant, not being entirely unwarranted. But the 
publication seems to survive in spite of attack, and 
now comes up smiling with its fifth quarterly issue, 
dated April, 1895, and supplied in this country by 
Messrs. Copeland & Day. Among the contents of 
this volume we note an amusing story by Mr. H. D. 
Traill ; a forced and turgid ode by Mr. William 
Watson ; " The Phantasies of Philarete," a story by 
Mr. James Ashcrof t Noble ; one of Dr. Garnett's 
finely-chiselled sonnets ; a charming sketch ( in 
French) by M. Anatole France, and an appreciative 
study of that writer by the Hon. Maurice Baring. 
A periodical that can boast of such collaboration as 
this, and of contributions by Messrs. Gosse, Ken- 
neth Grahame, Henry Harland, and John Davidson 
besides all within the compass of a single issue 
need not fear to lift its head boldly in the most crit- 
ical of literary circles. For the art of the present 
volume, there is not much to be said. It is some- 
times interesting, but that is all. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literature " 
(Putnam) is a " First Supplement " to Mr. William Swan 
Sonnenschein's "The Best Books," published in 1891. 
It is practically a classified list of all the books of any 
importance published during the past five years in the 
principal languages of Europe. In many cases, brief 
characterizations of the books are given. Enormous 
labor must have gone to the preparation of this vol- 
ume, which contains nearly eight hundred quarto pages, 
and which is simply indispensable to the librarian as 
well as to collectors or students in special fields. 

The exquisite Dent series of volumes devoted to " The 
Lyric Poets " (Macmillan) now includes a selection of 
" Lyrical Poetry from the Bible," edited by Mr. Ernest 
Rhys. The selections are mostly from the Psalms and 
the Book of Job. There is an introductory essay which 
says fitly the things that should be said in such a place, 
and an appended " historical synopsis " of the selections 
printed. A second volume, to contain passages from 
the Prophets and the Song of Songs, is promised. For 
frontispiece, Blake's " When the morning stars sang 
together " is reproduced. 

For the " English Readings " series of text-books 
(Holt), Mr. Clinton Scollard has prepared a carefully- 



annotated edition of Ford's " The Broken Heart." We 
are glad to see that noble tragedy thus brought into the 
classroom. Mr. Hammond Lament, in the same series, 
collects into a small volume a dozen of what he calls 
" Specimens of Exposition," for the purpose of training 
the student in preparing analyses of extended discus- 
sions. The selections range from Mommsen to a New 
York newspaper, and, in subject, from the steam-engine 
to Wordsworth. Another help for the instructor in 
English is Professor Cornelius B. Bradley's volume of 
"Orations and Arguments by English and American 
Statesmen" (Allyn). There are nine examples: two 
from Burke, one each from Chatham, Erskine, Webster, 
Macaulay, Calhoun, Seward, and Lincoln. The notes 
are ample and judicious. 



THOSE COURTS OF LOVE IN OLDEN TIME. 

No Courts of Love, you say, no Courts of Love 
Did ever meet ? Pedant, go to ! What trance 
Has touched you now ? By all the gods above, 
Leave us this sweet romance. 

You '11 next abolish all the knights a-tilt 
Beneath the light of golden ladies' eyes, 
And all the rainbow circle poets built 
That sat to judge the prize. 

No gallant knight e'er pricked along the plain 
Keen the fire-breathing dragon to oppose, 
Or in his woodland dream was ever fain 
To pluck the Rose. 

You '11 take the very rose itself away, 
With all the long-drawn sweet of its romaunt; 
My iridescent dragon, too, you '11 say 
Those woods did never haunt. 

No Courts of Love ! What pall is this comes down 
On all the widespread stillness of the place ? 
No Courts of Love, no queen, no rose, no crown ! 
Sad grows the human face. 

It must not, shall not be. Though fall to dust 
The reverend ark itself and its white dove, 
Dear Science, spite of all your proofs, we must 
Still keep the Courts of Love ! 

MARTHA FOOTE CROW. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Mr. Edward Arnold, the London publisher, has just 
established an American branch of his business, at 70 
Fifth avenue, New York. 

We learn with regret that Mr. Walter H. Page has 
resigned the editorship of " The Forum," which has 
been, under his management, our most dignified and 
authoritative monthly review. 

Mr. W. J. Courthope is a candidate for the chair of 
poetry at Oxford, shortly to be vacated by Professor 
Palgrave, and his candidacy is so strongly supported 
that election seems a foregone conclusion. 

Messrs. P. Blakiston, Son & Co. announce that their 
medical publications will hereafter be sold at absolutely 
net prices throughout the United States, and have, to 
this effect, made a general reduction from the prices 
hitherto published.

THE DIAL 



A committee of French scholars, aided by a subven- 
tion from the State, has for some time been engaged in 
preparing a new and complete edition of the writings 
of Descartes. The work will probably be completed by 
the close of this century. 

The New York Shakespeare Society will this sum- 
mer begin to print, in " Bankside " style, a five-text 
" Hamlet." Copies may be subscribed for only by mem- 
bers of the Society, or by others through members, prior 
to the printing of the first sheet. 

Messrs. Macmillan & Co. will publish " The Ameri- 
can Historical Review," and the first quarterly issue is 
promised for October. The board of editors consists 
of six well-known professors, from as many universities, 
while Professor J. F. Jameson, of Providence, R. I., 
will act as managing editor. 

A large number of representative English scholars 
and authors have signed a congratulatory address to be 
presented to Mr. George Haven Putnam, in recognition 
of the efforts made by him and his father, the late G. 
P. Putnam, to obtain from the United States Govern- 
ment a law for the protection of the literary property 
of foreigners. 

Dr. Suphan, the learned Director of the Goethe- und 
Schiller- Archiv at Weimar, communicated at the last 
general meeting of the Goethe-Gesellschaft an interest- 
ing find, consisting of the poet's effusions during his 
student days at Leipzig. It is entitled " Annette," in 
honor of Anna Katharina Schonkopf, and bears the date 
of "Leipzig, 1767." 

Mr. Frederick Locker - Lampson, says " The Book 
Buyer," completed a volume of literary reminiscences 
just before his death, which will soon appear, edited by 
Mr. Augustine Birrell. It is said to have been finally 
decided that the magnificent library of the dead poet, 
" the Rowfant books," will not come under the hammer, 
but remain intact in the possession of his family.

traits. 8vo, $4.50. 

"Among the half-dozen biographies of the first order 
which have appeared in the last twenty years, this volume 
deserves a place. It is a real biography ; a work of art as well 
as of fraternal affection ; a monument which several loving 
hands have helped to build up ; a lifelike picture of a remark- 
able man, with his failings not unnoted, and with vivid 
sketches of some of his friends." London Times.

" The original work and the translation by the late Amelia 
B. Edwards have been before the public about eight years, 
and full recognition has been accorded to their merits as to 
accuracy, fullness, and attractiveness. It were impossible to 
find a more competent writer or a more sympathetic trans- 
lator. The present edition has all the admirable features of 
the earlier, and some others in addition." New York Nation.

lay the book down until it is finished. Mrs. Ward has never written anything more dramatic than this story ; the agony of

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



THE STORY OF THE PLANTS. 

By GRANT ALLEN. A new volume in the Library of Useful 
Stones. Illustrated. IGmo, cloth, 40 cents. 
This timely book is a helpful and instructive addition to this 

successful series. The writer's thorough knowledge of his 

subject and his ability to express himself in clear and simple 

language impart a special value to his work. 

AN IMAGINATIVE MAN. 

L5y ROBERT S. HITCHENS, author of " The Green Carnation." 

12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

The subtlety, imaginative quality, and power of psycholog- 
ical analysis shown in this book, which is the author's most 
ambitious work, will surprise even those who were prompt to 
recognize the originality and rare talent of his earlier perform- 
ances. The scene is laid in Egypt, and the vividness and dra- 
matic force of certain scenes are achievements of high dis- 
tinction. As a study the book stands by itself ; as a story, 
the interest is constant and absorbing. The power and im- 
pressiveness of " An Imaginative Man" are qualities which 
must be recognized by the reading public. 

" Mr. Hitchens is a master of epigram. The first fiction of this au- 
thor is attracting much attention. His work is, both in form and spirit, 
ethical, social, and philosophical." 

IN OLD NEW ENGLAND. 

The Romance of a Colonial Fireside. By HEZEKIAH BUT- 
TERWORTH, author of "The Patriot Schoolmaster," "In 
the Boyhood of Lincoln," etc. No. 173, Town and Country 
Library. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

The romantic phases of colonial New England life are per- 
haps better known to Mr. Butterworth than to any other 
writer of the day, and the richness of his discoveries will de- 
light every reader of this volume. Colonial Boston and New- 
port and the traditions of King Philip's country live again in 
these charming pages, which offer a series of vivid pictures of 
a fascinating time. 

IN THE YEAR OF JUBILEE. 

By GEORGE GISSING, author of "Eve's Ransom," "Deuzil 

Qnarrier," etc. No. 172, Town and Country Library. I'Jmo, 

paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

This novel has been recognized as the masterpiece of an 
author whose individuality and vigorous talent have earned 
for him a place among the foremost English writers of fiction. 
The plot is novel, the characters singularly vivid, and the 
story possesses an unflagging interest. 

" Mr. George Gissing is one of the younger British novelists, whose 
work shows both finish and virility, qualities not always associated in 
the making of books. He is a writer of unusual literary felicity and 
analytical talent." 

THE MISTRESS OF QUEST. 

By ADELINE SERGEANT. No. 171, Town and Country Li- 
brary. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1 .00. 
Miss Sergeant's intensity and dramatic power have been 
abundantly recognized, but this romance is planned on broader 
lines than heretofore, and the sharp contrasts of characters 
the opposition of the daughter of London to the daughter of 
the moors results in a series of striking pictures and clean- 
cut character drawing which will remain in the reader's mem- 
ory. This is undoubtedly the author's most important work . 

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN CUISINE. 

By GESINE LEMCKE, author of " Desserts and Salads," and 
Principal of the Brooklyn Cooking College. Small 8vo, 
cloth, $2.00. 

A practical and complete guide to household cookery by a 
well-known teacher and lecturer, whose experience in Europe 
and in this country has enabled her to appreciate the require- 
ments to be satisfied. 



HANDBOOK OF SANITARY INFORMA- 
TION FOR HOUSEHOLDERS. 

By ROGER S. TRACY, M.D., Sanitary Inspector of the New- 
York City Health Department. New edition. IGmo, cloth, 
50 cents. 

Dr. Tracy's scientific knowledge and practical experience 
enable him to treat the subjects of ventilation, drainage, care 
of contagious diseases, disinfection, food, and water in a man- 
ner that will prove of value to every citizen. This book has 
been fully revised to include the latest discoveries and 
methods. 

FAMILIAR FLOWERS OF FIELD 
AND GARDEN. 

By F. SCHUYLER MATHEWS. Illustrated with 200 Drawings 

by the Author. 12mo. Library Edition, cloth, $1.75 ; 

Pocket Edition, flexible morocco, $2.25. 

" Seasonable and valuable. The young botanist and the lover of 
flowers, who have only studied from Nature, will be greatly aided by 
this work." Piitsburg Post. 

" Charmingly written, and to any one who loves the flowers and- 
who does not ? will prove no less fascinating than instructive. It will 
open up in the garden and the fields a new world full of curiosity and 
delight, and invest them with a new interest in his sight." Christian 
Work. 

HANDBOOK OF BIRDS 

OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. With Keys to the Species ; 
Descriptions of their Plumages, Nests, etc.; their Distribu-

Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology, American Museum 
of Natural History. With nearly 200 Illustrations. 12mo. 
Library Edition, cloth, $3.00 ; Pocket Edition, flexible 
morocco, $3.50. 

"I have examined the 'Handbook' with the greatest satisfaction. 
It is what I hoped for, what we have all waited for a true manual 
covering a broad field, but not too broad and crammed with knowledge, 
brightened throughout with pleasant description ; a book, I should 
think, for every student of birds, whether he knows much or little : 
invaluable, certainly, for all earnest amateurs." Bradford Torrey. 

" A valuable book, full of information compactly and conveniently 
arranged." New York Sun. 

" A charming book, of interest to every naturalist or student of nat- 
ural history." Cincinnati Times-Star.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE I. 

In pursuance of a long-established custom, 
" The Athenaeum " for July 6 publishes a se- 
ries of articles upon the literary output of the 
past year in the chief countries of Continental 
Europe. These articles are fourteen in num- 
ber, and include every country of any literary 
importance, with the single exception of Port- 



ugal. We propose, as in past years, to sum- 
marize the more important information pre- 
sented by these articles, in our present issue 
taking up France and Belgium together with 
the countries of Teutonic speech, and reserving 
for a subsequent review the remaining articles, 
chiefly devoted to the countries of Southern 
and Eastern Europe. 

" Literary activity in France," writes M. 
Joseph Reinach, " continues to be extremely 
prolific ; indeed, the output becomes greater in 
quantity year by year, but it would scarcely be 
true to say that during the last twelve months 
its quality has been either exceptionally bril- 
liant or of particularly solid merit." It is still 
the fashion in France to publish memoirs, and 
" everybody's sons and grandsons are busy ran- 
sacking the family desks and drawers in the 
search for letters and other ' remains ' of their 
forbears." The most important works of this 
class have been the memoirs of the Chancelier 
Pasquier, of General Thiebaud, and of Barras. 
Barras has been something of a disappointment. 
" His scandalous chatter offers no serious rev- 
elations ; the man, save for his performances 
on the 9th of Therrnidor, was one of the most 
vulgar figures in the history of the Revolution, 
and his untrustworthiness as a historian is only 
equalled by his duplicity as a statesman." In 
contemporary history the following publications 
have been noticeable : Two volumes of a " His- 
toire Generale du Second Empire," by M. de 
la Gorce ; a continuation of M. Alfred Du- 
quet's " Histoire Militaire du Siege de Paris 
par les Prussiens," " the most important work 
dealing with the war of 1870 which has yet 
been published in France "; the first volume of 
M. Emile Ollivier's " L'Empire Liberal "; and 
General Lebrun's posthumous book on his se- 
cret embassy to Vienna. Among political 
works are mentioned M. J. J. Weiss's post- 
humous " Combats Constitutionals," M. Rene 
Millet's " L'Expansion de France," and M. 
Eugene Eichthal's " Souverainete du Peuple et 
Gouvernement." M. Brunetiere's article on 
the " bankruptcy of science " and M. Berthol- 
ot's reply thereto have both been published in 
permanent form. In literary history and crit- 
icism, mention is made of M. Gaston Paris,

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



with his lectures on the poetry of the Middle 
Ages ; M. Monod, with his studies of Taine, 
Renan, and Michelet ; the " Livre du Centen- 
aire de 1'Ecole Normale "; and half a dozen 
volumes in the series of " Grands Ecrivains 
Fran^ais." Important works of art include the 
sixth volume of " L'Histoire de 1'Art dans 1'An- 
tiquite," by MM. Perrot et Chipiez ; "L'His- 
toire Ancienne des Peuples de FOrient Clas- 
sique," by M. Maspero ; the completion of M. 
Miintz's " Histoire de 1'Art pendant la Ren- 
aissance Italienne "; the beginning of M. Col- 
lignon's " Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque," 
and M. Gaston Boissier's essays on "L'Afrique 
Romaine." It is interesting to learn that M. 
Perrot " is a stylist as well as a savant" and 
that " his prose is always limpid and elegant." 
Readers of the astonishingly bad English trans- 
lation of his work would hardly suspect him of 
such qualities. In travel and description, M. 
Bourget's " Outre-Mer," and " Pierre Loti's" 
two books on "Jerusalem " and " Le Desert," 
are singled out for a few words of praise. The 
only thing really new and noteworthy in poetry 
seems to have been the " Pleureuses "of M. 
Henri Barbusse, " less a series of pieces than 
one long poem purely subjective in tone, and 
touched in the form of a reverie, telling of the 
charm of mourning and shadows, of solitude 
and sorrow." The most brilliant work of fic- 
tion produced by the year is " Le Lys Rouge " of 
M. Anatole France. " It is true that we are 
getting rather tired of aristocratic liaisons, and 
some passages in this book are outrageously 
licentious. But it is a flawlessly beautiful piece 
of prose, and the descriptions of Florence are 
a series of exquisite pictures. No one has ever 
succeeded in conveying the peculiar charm of 
-that delightful city more completely than M. 
France." The same author has published " Le 
Jardin d'Epicure," a volume of philosophical 
chats, and " Le Puits de Sainte-Claire," a col- 
lection of tales. The most noteworthy of other 
novels are " Les Demi-Vierges " of M. Pre- 
vost, " L' Armature " of M. Hervieu, the 
Myrrha " of M. Lemaitre, the " Fors 1'Hon- 
neur " of M. Margueritte, and " Le Silence " 
and " Les Roches Blanches " of M. Edouard 
Rod. 

Professor Paul Fredericq is the Belgian con- 
tributor to this series, and lays particular stress 
upon the department of social science, instanc- 
ing the " Essais et Etudes " of Emile de Lavel- 
eye, the " Depression Economique et Sociale " 
of M. Hector Denis, and the " Organisation de 
la Liberte et le Devoir Social " of M. A. Prins, 



among other works upon social problems. 
" Les Mysteres de Mithra," by Professor Cu- 
mont, and an " Etude Historique sur les Cor- 
poration Professionnelles chez les Remains," 
by Professor J. P. Waltzing, are named as the 
most important publications in ancient history. 
Passing by the books of travel and of Belgian 
history enumerated, we come to literature 
proper. M. Maeterlinck, it seems, while being 
himself translated into Polish and other lan- 
guages, has been translating Emerson and No- 
valis into French. In literary history, there 
is Professor Thomas's " Histoire de la Littera- 
ture Latine jusqu'aux Antonins," and M. Paul 
Hamelius's " Histoire Politique et Litteraire 
du Mouvement Flamand." Flemish literature 
also flourishes, counting among its products the 
" Letterkundige Studien " of M. Rooses, " De 
j3Esthetieck van het Lyrisch Drama " of M. A. 
Cornette, and volumes of poems by Mile. Hilda 
Ram, M. Emmanuel Hiel, and M. Pol de 
Mont. Fiction is represented chiefly by the 
" Boerenkrijg " of M. van den Bergh, a story 
of the insurrection of the peasants of Flanders 
against the conscription of the first French 
Republic ; " Sursum Corda," by M. Cyriel 
Buysse, a novel descriptive of the aristocratic 
classes, with their narrowness, their prejudice, 
and their complete subjection to clerical dicta- 
tion ; and two novels " Eene Idylle " and "De 
Bruid des Heeren " by Mile. Virginie Love- 
ling, " the chief of modern Flemish prose 
writers." 

It is an easy transition from Belgium to Hol- 
land, and we turn to M. Taco de Beer's report 
from the latter country. " The younger gen- 
eration have most of them abandoned poetry 
altogether," he says ; the reader who wishes to 
know what they have done is referred to Heer 
van Hall's " Dichters van Onzen Tijd," an ex- 
cellent anthology. Dr. Jan ten Brink of Ley- 
den has begun the publication of an illustrated 
history of literature in the Netherlands. Un- 
interrupted activity is shown in historical writ- 
ing. In fiction, the tale of country life and 
the novel of the Dutch colonies are mentioned 
as two species that seem to be dying out. A 
few novels are singled out for extended men- 
tion, but none of them described with much 
enthusiasm. Among these are the " Geheiligd " 
of Miss Marie Gyzen, the " Zonder Illusie " 
of Mrs. Therese Hoven, and the " Sascha " of 
a new author who calls himself " Prosper van 
Haamstede " for purposes of the pen. 

The article on Germany, by Hofrath Zim- 
mermann, is much the longest of the series.

To begin with, he tells of volumes of poetry 
without end, describing at considerable length 
the " Robespierre " epic of Frl. delle Grazie 
and the didactic poem " Faust und Prome- 
theus " of Herr Hango. In the former, " the 
author developes her conception of the French 
Revolution in a series of varied, effective pic- 
tures, sometimes, however, degenerating into 
coarseness." Of the latter we read : " His 
Faust is not Gretchen's Faust, but his ' grand- 
son '; it is not love-making, but investigation 
of the universe, that engages him ; Prometheus, 
the thief of fire, kindles the torch for him, too, 
which illumines the darkness of the eternal 
riddle of nature and humanity. Dealing with 
the science of to-day, whose teachings he ren- 
ders in luminous parables and melodious verses, 
the poet, with commendable outspokenness, 
declares himself against the lawlessness that 
follows in its train as well as the gloomy pes- 
simism which is built up upon it." Herr Nor- 
dau has published a play, " Die Kugel," which 
has not proved successful. Herr Sudermann's 
comedy, " Die Schmetterlingsschlacht," was a 
failure in Berlin and a success in Vienna. It 
" is more suggestive of a contest between loath- 
some, poisonous spiders than one between light 
but lovely butterflies." The same writer has 
scored the greatest success of the year in fic- 
tion with his novel " Es War." " A deep 
moral tone breathes through the whole ; the 
descriptions of the country and the people that 
appear in it have a North German, or, to be 
more accurate, East Prussian character ; the 
local coloring of the language, the mode of 
thought, the conduct of life, are singularly 
successful." Herr Spielhagen's latest novel, 
" Stumme des Himmels," is described as lack- 
ing in lifelike character. It " possesses neither 
a political nor a social purpose ; it only deals 
with a question of society, and a tolerably well- 
worn one, being an onslaught 011 aristocratic 
prejudices." The " professorial " novel seems 
to be played out, neither the " Cleopatra " of 
Herr Ebers nor the " Julian der Abtriinnige " 
of Herr Dahn having succeeded in effacing the 
memory of their predecessors. Other fiction 
of note includes "Wider den Kurfiirsten," by 
Herr Hans Hoffmann, a tale of the siege of 
Stettin in 1678 ; "Die Martinsklause," by Herr 
Ludwig Ganghofer ; and shorter stories by 
Herr Heyse and Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach. 
Bismarck literature naturally cuts a large fig- 
ure in the work of the year, and includes a five- 
volume biography by Herr Hans Blum, a col- 
lection of Fiirst Bismarck's speeches, a new 



volume of " Tischgesprache " (including some 
interesting conversations with Motley), and 
even the first issue of a Bismarck " Jahrbuch." 
Professor von Sybel's " Geschichte der Be- 
griindung des Deutschen Reichs durch Wil- 
helm I.," of which the sixth and seventh vol- 
umes have appeared during the year, is vir- 
tually a biography of the Iron Chancellor. 
Goethe literature is represented by Herr Rich- 
ard Meyr's essays, and Shakespeare literature 
by Herr E. Bormann's " Shakespeare-Geheim- 
niss," which latter, " in its curious handling of 
the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy, surpasses 
all its American and European predecessors in 
grotesque invention. According to this author, 
Bacon's Instauratio Magna consists of two 
parts, the one scientific and written in prose 
under his own name, the other symbolic, in 
dramatic form, under the pseudonym Shake- 
speare. Herr Bormann finds hints of the solu- 
tion of this riddle, in particular in the names 
of the characters ; thus in ' Hamlet ' the soldier 
Francisco is no other than Francis Bacon, while 
Horatio, who to Bernardo's question, ' What, is 
Horatio here ? ' replies, ' A piece of him,' de- 
sired thereby to designate the wisdom (Ho- 
ratio) of Bacon, which was embodied in him ! " 
Germany has lost two great men during the 
year, Freytag and Carriere. Of the latter, 
described as " the most eloquent and purest 
representative " of idealism, there have been 
published three books : " Christus," " Das 
Wachsthum der Energie," and " Fichte's Geis- 
tesentwickelung." They "breathe the same 
enthusiastic inspiration, and reveal the same 
passion for beauty" as the older works by which 
Carriere is so widely known. 

Dr. Alfred Ipsen, writing of Danish litera- 
ture, tells us that Denmark exhibits some symp- 
toms of a renascence of poetry, and, in fiction, 
" a tendency toward symbolism and sundry 
vague forms of mysticism." Herr Drachmann 
has, in " Vblund Smed," given political hand- 
ling to a familiar Eddaic myth, the work being 
characterized by an " exuberant and some- 
what sentimental sensuousness." Herr J. Jor- 
gensen's " Bekendelse " is a beautiful collec- 
tion of poems. " A characteristic of this au- 
thor, as of others of the younger generation, is 
a certain monotony and a total absence of ideas ; 
everything is emotional with them, and there 
is a tone of archaism in their imagery." The 
most important novel of the year is " Hjarl," 
by Herr Einar Christiansen. " The book is by 
no means sensational, but recounts plainly and 
quietly the story of a young man from his boy-

hood in a rich, aristocratic, but somewhat mo- 
notonous home, his hopes and strivings and his 
disappointments and shortcomings, telling it in 
an earnest tone, which moves the reader with- 
out being in the least sentimental." Another 
noteworthy novel is by Herr Schandorph, called 
" The College Years of Vilhelin Vang," which 
pictures "the hidden opposition between in- 
herited culture and the modern plutocracy." 
" As for books on literature, the year has fur- 
nished a crop uncommonly rich in quality. 
There are at least two voluminous studies of 
more than usual ability : a monograph on Swed- 
ish Romanticism (the literature of the first 
half of the present century), a beautiful book 
written in a somewhat rough style, by Herr V. 
Vedel ; and a large monograph on Poul Mol- 
ler, a Danish poet of the same period, by Herr 
Vilhelm Andersen, a young and promising stu- 
dent of our literature." 

Norway was not represented in the " Athen- 
aeum " summary of a year ago, and perhaps it 
is for this reason that the Norwegian corre- 
spondent, Dr. C. Brinchmann, does not confine 
himself to the happenings of a single year, but 
roves somewhat indefinitely over the whole field 
of recent literature. He purposely says little 
of the two men who chiefly represent Norwe- 
gian literature, because their recent works are 
already familiar enough to English readers. 
The man who stands next to them in import- 
ance is Herr Lie, whose latest work, " Lystige 
Koner," is not a novel, but a play. It is said 
to have made "rather a weak impression." 
Herr Garborg has just published a tale in verse, 
" Haugtussa," in which " he relates the sad 
love story of a young peasant girl who grows 
up amongst the cattle and the ling -covered 
hills. The girl is a visionary who holds con- 
verse with fairies and other supernatural be- 
ings, and some parts of the book contain so 
much naively gentle poetry that one is amazed 
how Garborg's morbidly reflective mind could 
have produced it." " Det Store Lod," the lat- 
est piece of Herr Gunnar Heiberg, the dram- 
atist, " describes the influence of money on an 
enthusiastic idealist." Herr Knut Hamsun, 
one of the newer men, is made the subject of 
a paragraph, which concludes with mention of 
" Pan," characterized as " a wonderful book, 
notable for deep and genuinely poetic descrip- 
tions of nature and daring love scenes," and 
the drama, " Ved Rigets Port," a " weak and 
rather ordinary production." The best known 
of women writers, Camilla Collett, died a few 
months ago, and we are told of the rest that, 



with the exception of Fru Amalie Skram, they 
" scarcely need to be mentioned from the point 
of view of art." Other items of interest are 
the continuation of Herr Jaeger's history of 
Norwegian literature, and Herr Collin's "Kunst 
og Moral," which "gallantly takes the field 
against the immoralities of naturalism, and 
warmly insists that the laws of morality should 
be respected even in art." 

Swedish literature, with which we close this 
section of our summary, is discussed by Herr 
Hugo Tigerschiold. " The Swedish poetical 
temperament, strongly influenced by its natural 
environment of vast and sombre forests, widely 
extending lakes, and foss-broken streams, is 
fundamentally lyrical. The simple, melan- 
choly tone of a folk-song runs through all true 
Swedish poetry." A number of lyrists have 
published during the past year, representing 
both the older and the newer schools. Real- 
ism, it seems, is losing its hold in Sweden, and 
" a strong bent towards romanticism and sym- 
bolism is observable in every direction." This 
dictum is illustrated by mention of several 
works of fiction, the most noticeable being Fru 
Mailing's "En Roman om Forste Konsuln." 
This book is described as " containing un- 
usually elegant and intimate sketches of the 
most remarkable personages who lived during 
the earlier stage of Napoleon's career. With 
the exception of Napoleon himself, who is too 
romantically drawn, and the heroine (the youth- 
ful Edmee), a prettily poetic creature, the 
other numerous personages in the romance are 
excellent portraits. This romance, which tes- 
tifies to careful study, especially of the memoir 
writers of the period, is marked by quite an 
extraordinary power of vivid and concentrated 
character-sketching." The Bellman and Gus- 
taf Adolf commemorative festivals, both held 
during the past year, are discussed at some 
length, and each has stimulated the production 
of a considerable literature. Herr Victor Ryd- 
berg is represented by " Varia," a volume con- 
taining the " pieces written by him of late years, 
pieces in which the author, with youthful en- 
thusiasm, goes forth to combat modern mater- 
ialism." Herr Tigerschiold's paper ends with 
the following bit of news : " The Swedish Au- 
thors' Union, which published its first literary 
calendar at Christmas, with contributions from 
many of our most eminent authors, has peti- 
tioned the Government for several necessary 
modifications to the legislation referring to lit- 
erature, with a view to Sweden's accession to 
the Berne Convention."

"THE COMING CONTmENT." * 

Victor Hugo's prediction that in the twen- 
tieth century Africa would be the cynosure of 
every eye seems already in a fair way of ful- 
filment. According to a later dictum, of Lord 
Salisbury, " foreign politics " already means 
for England African politics ; and what Europe 
in general thinks of the natural resources and 
political possibilities of the " coming continent " 
may be gathered from the broad fact that of 
its total area of 12,000,000 square miles she 
has left unappropriated only about 1,000,000, 
which are confined to the sandy wastes of the 
Libyan Desert and the powerful and inacces- 
sible States of the Soudan. Africa contains 
about one-quarter of the land of the globe, her 
area being more than thrice Europe's, or almost 
as much as North and South America's com- 
bined ; and as one-fifth of her surface consists 
of rich savannas, and one-half of imperfectly 
tilled fields and fairly fertile virgin soil, the 
Malthusian danger in its broader aspect would 
seem to be, in our era of swift transport and 
world-wide commercial solidarity, relegated to 
the dim future, even for the populous countries 
of Western Europe. 

A popular general account of this deeply 
interesting transitional Africa of to-day, with 
its unique confrontation of the old and the 
new, the polished and the barbaric, which may 
serve in lieu of first-hand impressions that very 
few of us are likely to attain, is a need which 
is now satisfactorily met by Mr. Frank Vin- 
cent's "Actual Africa." Mr. Vincent is a 
veteran traveller who needs no introduction in 
that capacity to our readers ; and his latest 
work shows the same modest merits of pith and 
literalness of statement, and abstention from 
heightened colors and strained contrasts, which 
have made his widely-read volume on South 
America a favorite with readers in want of 
plain information. Leaving to more florid pens 
the task of painting the marvels and dilating 
on the mysterious and legendary past of the 
mighty continent that has inspired the literary 
fancy since the times of Herodotus and Strabo, 
he contents himself with setting forth in sim- 
ple prose such simple facts of actual observa- 
tion as any plain traveller seeking information 
would wish to gather for himself. If a certain 

* ACTUAL AFRICA ; or, The Coming Continent. A Tour of 
Exploration. By Frank Vincent. Illustrated. New York : 
D. Appleton & Co. 



flavor of the guide-book is now and then mani- 
fest in Mr. Vincent's work, that does not, at 
least, impair its usefulness. " Actual Africa " 
is the fruit of two years' travel, within which 
period the continent was circled, and several 
deep dips were taken into the interior notably 
one, by river and caravan-road, to the capital 
of the famous Basongo chieftain, Pania Mu- 
tembo, in the heart of the Congo Free State. 
Nearly all the capitals and large towns, native 
and foreign, of the seaboard countries were 
visited ; Madagascar was traversed ; a long ex- 
cursion was made through the centre of the 
Boer Republics and British Colonies ; the Nile, 
Quanza, Congo, Kassai, Sankuru, and Kuilu 
rivers were ascended ; and a detour was made 
by Madeira, the Canaries, and the Cape Verdes. 
The author's attention was about evenly divided 
between the native States, with their depen- 
dencies, on the one hand, and European pos- 
sessions and protectorates, on the other ; and 
it may perhaps be objected that a rather dis- 
proportionate amount of space (over a third of 
the volume) is given to the already familiar 
Mediterranean countries, which are now well 
within the orbit even of " conducted " tourists. 
Mr. Vincent is a quick observer and a succinct 
writer ; and while anything like a fair resume 
of his very copious record is out of the ques- 
tion here, a few random passages from the more 
noteworthy chapters may serve as samples of 
the whole. 

An interesting account is given of Kimber- 
ley, the capital and centre of the diamond min- 
ing district. Kimberley is a progressive mod- 
ern city, with its population of 30,000, its 
tramways, electric lighting, cabs, good shops, 
hotels, theatres, daily papers, and Botanical 
Garden. The four great mines, the Kimberley, 
the De Beers, and the Bulfontein and Dutoits- 
pan, lie on the outskirts of the town, and are 
now united under the control of the De Beers 
Consolidated Mines, Limited, with a capital of 
$20,000,000, a sum about equalling the annual 
output. During the past twenty years South 
Africa has exported over fifty millions of car- 
ats of diamonds, of a total value of $375,000,- 
000 ; so that, a carat equalling four grains, the 
weight of diamonds exported has amounted to 
about fifteen tons ! The Kimberley gems pre- 
sent a great variety of colors green, blue, 
pink, brown, yellow, orange, etc., with the in- 
termediate tints. The stones vary in size from 
those of that of a pin's head to one found a few 
years ago in the De Beers Mine, which weighed 
in the rough 428| carats, and measured (un-

cut) nearly two inches through the longest axis. 
About 12,000 natives are now employed, night 
and day, in the mines, under the supervision 
of some 1300 Europeans. 

" Formerly there was a great deal of diamond steal- 
ing by native diggers and dishonest buying by white 
merchants. It is even said that these thieves stole one- 
quarter of the entire yield. Improved methods of sur- 
veillance are rapidly diminishing this loss. Now none 
but authorized agents are permitted to purchase or pos- 
sess rough diamonds, a large detective force is employed, 
and the natives are domiciled and confined in ' com- 
pounds ' or villages, enclosed by high walls, with doors 
of sheet iron." 

At the Kimberley Mine the author inspected 
one of these " compounds " a great square 
lined by iron sheds, surrounded by a high fence, 
and partially covered by a wire netting ar- 
ranged so as to prevent the miners throwing 
diamonds to confederates outside the barriers. 
The period of service for which the diggers 
engage is usually three months. 

From Kimberley the author went by rail to 
Cape Town, whence he sailed for Madeira, and 
thence back, touching at the Canaries and the 
Cape Verdes, to the Portuguese province of 
Angola. The Angolan towns of Loanda, Ben- 
guela, Mossamedes, etc., were inspected, and a 
run of five hundred miles was made into the 
interior. Of the natural condition of Angola 
Mr. Vincent speaks most favorably, pronounc- 
ing it, in view of its geographical position, 
variety of climate, and natural resources, su- 
perior to any other European possession of 
tropical Africa. He takes occasion at this 
point to interpolate a chapter touching the cav- 
alier treatment of Portugal by the Powers in 
respect of her African territory especially by 
England. The Berlin Conference deprived 
her of the region between Congo and Angola 
(including the mouth of the Congo) with its 
valuable riparian revenues, and England's ulti- 
matum of 1890 forced her to abandon her 
claims in the Shire Highlands and in Nyassa- 
land, as well as in Manica, Matabele, and Mash- 
onaland. Portugal's claims to African terri- 
tory, resting on papal grant, discovery, priority 
of possession, and continuous manifestations 
(usually rather symbolical, we think) of sov- 
ereignty, have been pushed aside by England 
on the eminently Anglo-Saxon plea that since 
the Portuguese have shown that they can 
neither govern, colonize, nor develop their "pos- 
sessions," it is high time that, in the interests 
of civilization, they were turned out of them. 
That African interests are likely to be better 
served in English than in Portuguese hands is 



scarcely an open question ; but Mr. Vincent 
has no patience with this sort of logic. It is 
not, he thinks, at all a question of superior 
methods of colonization, " but simply to which 
nation belongs the truest ' claims of posses- 
sion ' " in which case, one might urge, the 
claims of the native tribes (though unsupported 
by papal grant) might even outweigh those of 
Portugal. The author goes on to say : 

" Whether England can the better civilize inferior 
races, whether she can the sooner stop slavery or inter- 
tribal wars, whether she were the ablest to establish 
commerce, are interesting inquiries but can have noth- 
ing whatever to do with the present matter, which is 
solely a question of ownership of ground, or what in 
Africa has always constituted ownership. ... In this 
political partition England has exactly reversed the 
maxim emblazoned on the facade of the Boer Parlia- 
ment House at Pretoria, that ' right makes might,' and 
has taken a course with Portugal like that which she re- 
cently took at Venezuela, regarding the frontier of Gui- 
ana, and has previously taken several times with smaller 
and feebler nations throughout the world. She breaks 
the Zulu power, but not the Russian. Her policy of ex- 
pansion is always out of Europe ; in Europe she does noth- 
ing until she can find an ally. She has been thoroughly 
immoral in her dealings with weaker States, and seems 
always ready and eager to follow up her ' moral claims ' 
with very material troops and iron-dads. Is it not time 
that the motto ' Dieu et mon droit ' was changed to ' Dieu 
et ma force'?" 

All generous spirits must lament, with Mr. 
Vincent, Portugal's military and economic ina- 
bility to defend and justify her claims to that 
large share of the African continent which she 
so magnificently founded in the days of Vasco 
de Gama and Bartholomew Diaz. But in the 
centuries succeeding her period of maritime 
glory she has been hopelessly outstripped in the 
race of national progress ; and, sentiment aside, 
we find it difficult to regret that her once vast 
African possessions have largely slipped from 
her nerveless hands into the powerful grasp of 
the race which, with all its faults of territorial 
greed and apathy to the moral claims of weaker 
rivals, is the true Mother of Nations and the 
inheritor of the political and colonizing genius 
of ancient Kome. England has confessedly 
played the bully more than once with lesser 
nations, and her recent minor wars have re- 
dounded little to her credit. Mr. Eider Hag- 
gard has spoken plainly of her " unjustifiable " 
attack upon the Zulus, and Mr. Labouchere 
has poured upon her the vials of his party 
wrath, touching the Matabele war. There is 
even a tincture of truth in Mr. Chamberlain's 
frank avowal that her Empire is the fruit of 
generations of buccaneering. But it must nev- 
ertheless be admitted that if she has taken much, 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



she has given more ; that she has sown her 
path of conquest and influence with the seeds 
of progress, and planted and maintained law 
and order and the machinery of judicial jus- 
tice, where anarchy and public rapine have been 
the rule for ages. The record of her sway over 
foreign lands and peoples, if necessarily marred 
by human errors of judgment and conscience, 
shows nevertheless in its long roll of successes 
and benefactions but one conspicuous failure. 
Such petty flings as that England " breaks the 
Zulu power, but not the Russian," and that 
" her policy of expansion is always out of Eu- 
rope," seem sadly out of place in Mr. Vincent's 
usually sensible and informing book. That 
England has not wasted herself and embroiled 
Europe in an insane attempt to " break the 
power " of Russia, and that her " policy of ex- 
pansion " has chosen the line of least resistance 
and widest promise, can scarcely be charged 
to her as a lapse either of statesmanship or 
good morals. 

The author gives a pithy and detailed ac- 
count of his trip from Boma, mainly by way of 
the Congo River and its tributaries, the Kasai, 
Lulua, Sankuru, Kuilu, etc., into the interior 
of the Congo Free State. Many interesting 
facts as to the natives and their wonderful coun- 
try are recorded, and Mr. Vincent's ascent of 
the Kuilu seems to fairly entitle him to rank 
as an African explorer. Near Leopoldville, in 
the Congo region, he had an opportunity of 
observing a native market. 

" The sellers were nearly all women. There was a 
good variety of local produce, but no manufactures. 
Perhaps four hundred people were present, and their 
chaffering produced a perfect Babel. These markets are 
held regularly twice a week. You see manioc in several 
styles, cooked and uncooked and ground into flour, palm 
oil and kernels, beans, maize, salad, fowls, eggs, plain- 
tains, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, peanuts, peppers, to- 
bacco, large fish from the Congo, fruits, etc. These 
things will be bartered for cheap blue cotton cloth, col- 
ored handkerchiefs, and bits of coarse brass wire, shaped 
like staples. These last pass for change, and are gen- 
erally carried in large bunches." 

Regarding the mental condition of the Ba- 
kongos, a tribe dwelling about the banks of 
the Kassai, Mr. Vincent observes : 

" They are in most respects in a similar condition to 
that of children of eight or ten years old. They do 
not seem to think, reflect, or remember. The experi- 
ence of one is not always utilized by another. . . . Fear 
they possess in no unstinted degree, but love, other 
than the mere animal fondness of the mother for her 
offspring, seems entirely wanting. . . . They seem to 
have few religious ideas, and fewer institutions. Like 
all such forest-folk the expression of their religious feel- 
ing seems due to fear, fear of all the phenomena and 
processes of Nature which they cannot comprehend. 



. . . The missionaries have now been at work some ten 
years among this and kindred tribes, but their success 
has been very dubious. Satisfactory statistics are not 
forthcoming to outside inquirers. The trouble is the 
natives lack capacity. They cannot comprehend the 
Christian scheme of salvation, though they may be 
bribed to say they do, and to lead lives for a time in 
partial accordance therewith. But they are liable at 
any moment to relapse to paganism, and return to sav- 
agedom. . . . When I observe the prognathous heads 
and the utter bestial expression of these natives I am 
fully persuaded of the correctness of the Darwinian 
hypothesis. It requires no stretch of imagination to 
believe that this form of man, instead of being a little 
lower than the angels, is simply a trifle higher than the 
monkeys." 

We have no desire of reviving in these col- 
umns any discussion of the " Missionary Ques- 
tion." But we venture to suggest that the real 
measure of the success of missionary enterprise 
among the Congo tribes is less the number of 
nominal Christians made than the degree in 
which the missionaries have succeeded in estab- 
lishing among these undeveloped anthropoid 
beings such rudimentary arts and conceptions 
of European culture as are within their mental 
grasp. There are no chasms in the continuity 
of human progress, individual or aggregate. 
To assert that so or so many of Mr. Vincent's 
Bakongos, Bakutus, or Bakubas have "em- 
braced Christianity " is, rightly understood, to 
assert that they have made the enormous intel- 
lectual leap from the grossest fetishism to a 
refined and abstract system of theology to 
say nothing of a doctrine of ideal morality the 
theory of which is as far out of their reach as 
its practice is out of that of the average Eu- 
ropean. The real difficulty in the way of mis- 
sionary progress is simply stated by our author 
when he says that the natives " cannot compre- 
hend the Christian scheme of salvation "; and 
its only solution is partially indicated when he 
adds : " Possibly by selecting a few of the 
brightest of the boys, and beginning their in- 
struction when very young, isolating them in 
the missions, and then pursuing the same course 
with their children for a few generations, some- 
thing might eventually result." 

We shall take leave of Mr. Vincent's nar- 
rative with an extract from his account of that 
redoubtable potentate, King Pania Mutembo : 

" He appeared as a dignified old gentleman, bearing 
a long wand as a badge of authority. He was dressed 
in a white shirt, open in front and worn over a colored 
silk waist-cloth, which descended like a skirt to his bare 
feet. Over the shirt he wore a light sack-coat, after 
the approved manner of Syrian and Egyptian drago- 
mans. His turban of blue cloth was arranged with the 
ends extending at the sides like the head-gear of the 
conventional Egyptian Sphinx. Around his neck he

wore four or five chains of immense blue beads, and 
also many bracelets of the same. Upon one finger was 
a copper ring, and upon his ankles were bands of leather. 
. . . The King went as he came, with much hauteur, 
his people fleeing in every direction before his approach. 
Pania Mutembo is reported to glory in upwards of five 
hundred < wives.' . . . We told the King that in our 
countries the married men were accustomed to have 
but one wife each. He replied that there our wealth was 
in other things, in gold and silver, and in ships and fac- 
tories, but here his property was in these wives, whom 
if he chose he could barter for anything he wanted." 

As a popular general description of the Africa 
of to-day, Mr. Vincent's book has no superior. 
There are over one hundred photographic illus- 
trations, together with a good route map and 
a sufficient index ; and the publishers have 
shown their usual sound taste and liberality in 
the general make-up of the volume.

THE THIRD VOLUME or MR. RHODES'S 
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.* 



The first chapter of the third volume of Mr. 
Rhodes's " History of the United States " is de- 
voted to the material progress of the country 
from 1850 to 1860, leaving out of view the 
striking events and political agitations of this 
period, and dealing only with the common life 
of the people, or what the author calls " the 
blank leaves of history." And yet the subject 
is so admirably handled that we believe no 
chapter in the volume will awaken a livelier 
interest or better repay a careful perusal. He 
refers to the increase of our population and our 
material prosperity in their relation to the well- 
being of the masses. He dwells upon the pro- 
gress of mechanical invention and the marvel- 
lous growth of our merchant marine. He 
refers to railway extension and steam naviga- 
tion on our western rivers as great factors in 
our national progress. He devotes several 
pages to a very clear and timely exposition of 
the tariff question in connection with the panic 
of 1857 and the tariff acts of that year and 
the year 1846, and he says these acts demon- 
strate that a high protective tariff is not nec- 
essary for the growth of our manufacturing in- 
dustry. He deals with the question of political 
corruption, the health of the people, their pro- 
gress in taste, refinement, and manners, the 
theatre, and the lecture system which reached 
its height during this period. He speaks of 
this decade as the golden age of American lit-

erature, giving it credit for Bryant, Prescott, 
Irving, Lowell, Holmes, Hawthorne, and Em- 
erson, and bestowing deserved praises upon the 
the only three magazines, " Harper's," " Put- 
nam's," and the " Atlantic." He deals with 
the sexual morality of the people, their relig- 
ious character, including a graphic account of 
the great revival of 1858, their seriousness 
combined with their love of humor, and their 
honesty in private life as contrasted with their 
lack of it in the management of public affairs. 
Indeed, the picture of American society and 
life is so charmingly drawn in this chapter that 
the impression left upon the mind of the reader 
is singularly wholesome and satisfying, while 
his love of country is heightened and his faith 
in our popular system of government is con- 
firmed. 

The other chapters of the volume deal with 
the state of the country following the presi- 
dential election of 1860 and including the first 
year of the War ; and they constitute by far 
the most important contribution to the history 
of this period which has yet appeared. The 
work is thoroughly and faithfully done, as at- 
tested by the ample foot-notes which support 
and illustrate the text, while the style is so 
lucid and animated that the attention of the 
reader is never intermitted. We feel confident 
that this volume will fully confirm the impres- 
sion made by the two preceding ones that the 
author has a genius for writing history. Mr. 
Rhodes discusses at much length the famous 
Crittenden Compromise, and he shows that it 
was not the secessionists of the Senate, as has 
often been asserted, but the Republican leaders, 
who defeated the measure. He thinks that 
Lincoln was chiefly responsible, for he says 
that if he had favored the measure Seward 
would have joined him and their influence 
would have secured its adoption, thus averting 
for the time the catastrophe of war. Whether 
Lincoln and the Republicans may be justified 
in their course at the bar of history he treats 
as a debatable question, and after considering 
it at considerable length and in all its bearings, 
he says : 

" Between these alternatives, one of which was civil 
war, with its waste of blood and treasure, with its train 
of men's sacrifices and women's anguish, and with its 
failure to settle the race question in the South; and the 
other, which would have been an aggravated repetition 
of what took place between 1854 and 1860, with the 
probability of a war to follow between more powerful 
contestants; between these an historian may well shrink 
from pronouncing a decided choice." 

We think this statement challenges criticism.

THE DIAL 



It assumes that the question of duty involved 
in the alternative here presented was to be de- 
termined by carefully estimating the conse- 
quences of the choice to be made and not by 
the character of the surrender which this com- 
promise offered the South for the sake of peace. 
It overlooks the fact that there are worse things 
than war, even civil war, with all its unspeak- 
able horrors, and that a nation has no right to 
purchase peace at the price of dishonor. What 
was this now almost forgotten compromise? 
It provided that in all the territory of the 
United States then held or thereafter acquired 
situate north of latitude 36 30' slavery should 
be prohibited, but that in all the territories south 
of said line it should be recognized as existing, 
and should not be interfered with by Congress, 
but should be protected as property by all the 
departments of the territorial government dur- 
ing its continuance. It provided that Congress 
should have no power to abolish slavery in 
places under its exclusive jurisdiction and sit- 
uate within the limits of States that permitted 
the holding of slaves : that Congress should 
have no power to abolish slavery in the Dis- 
trict of Columbia without compensation, and 
without the consent of its inhabitants, of Vir- 
ginia, and of Maryland ; that Congress should 
have no power to prohibit or hinder the trans- 
portation of slaves between slave-holding States 
and Territories ; that provision should be made 
for the payment of the owners by the United 
States for rescued fugitive slaves ; and that no 
future amendment of the Constitution should 
affect the five preceding articles, and no amend- 
ment should be made to the Constitution which 
would authorize or give to Congress any power 
to abolish or interfere with slavery in any of 
the States by whose laws it was or might be 
allowed or permitted. 

Under these provisions slavery would no 
longer be a local institution dependent upon 
State law, but a national institution made per- 
petual by unalterable provisions of the Consti- 
tution. That such concessions would be fol- 
lowed by further demands is as certain as the 
action of gravitation. The career of slavery in 
the United States up to this time proved this. 
The adoption of this compromise would have 
made the acquisition of Cuba the watchword 
and rallying cry of the South. Filibustering 
for other tropical acquisitions would certainly 
have followed, while the revival of the foreign 
slave-trade would have been espoused as a part 
of the inevitable logic of the new dispensation. 
In a word, a great slave - holding and slave- 



breeding despotism would have been estab- 
lished on the ruins of the Republic, unless pre- 
vented by the military power of the free States 
in a conflict far more uncertain in its issue and 
more calamitous in its results than was our 
Civil War. But aside from any question of 
consequences, the Crittenden Compromise was 
utterly indefensible as a scheme of bare-faced 
treachery to freedom. In the words of Lin- 
coln, it would have " put us again on the high- 
road to a slave empire." It was a shameless 
repudiation of the principle on which the peo- 
ple had made him president, and a wanton be- 
trayal of the country to its enemies. It would 
have gladdened the hearts of despots and stifled 
the voice of republicanism throughout the world. 
If the courage and clear-sightedness of Lin- 
coln averted these calamities, then he, of all the 
famous men of his time, has the best right to 
be honored as the savior of his country. 

Mr. Rhodes discusses the generally accepted 
theory that the work of secession was concocted 
by a cabal of Southern senators and represent- 
atives in Washington, who gave direction to 
the movement through its ramifications in the 
States and interfered with the free action of 
the people. He carefully overhauls the his- 
toric facts bearing upon the question, and 
reaches the conclusion that no such conspiracy 
existed. He had shown in dealing with the 
Crittenden Compromise that Jefferson Davis 
was ready for a settlement upon that basis, and 
deplored the necessity for war. The course of 
Stephens in opposition to secession is well- 
known. Even Toombs, with all his impulsive- 
ness and bluster, was complained of by his 
Southern friends as too conservative. Says 
Mr. Rhodes : 

" In its public manifestations secession had all the 
marks of a popular movement, proceeding in the regu- 
lar manner which we should expect from a community 
accustomed to constitutional government and to dele- 
gate its powers to chosen representatives. Legislatures 
called conventions of the people. Then, after animated 
canvasses in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana, and af- 
ter full understanding by the electors in all of the states 
that they were voting for immediate secession or in 
favor of delay, delegates were chosen to the convention 
at popular elections. Soon after each convention met 
it adopted by an imposing majority its ordinance of 
secession." 

The facts of the case in some of the States are 
not all in harmony with these statements, but 
when carefully sifted they do not support the 
conspiracy theory. Mr. Rhodes thinks it very 
doubtful whether Davis, Toombs, Orr, and 
Benjamin, had they agreed with Stephens, 
could have prevented secession, and that if they

[Aug. 1, 



had not headed the movement the people would 
have found other leaders. It will not be easy 
to dislodge the well-nigh universal opinion of 
the people of the Northern States ever since 
the outbreak of the Rebellion, and make them 
believe that the secession movement was the 
work of the people of the South, whose reputed 
leaders were only reluctant followers. But the 
truth ought to be known, and when supported 
by such authorities as Rhodes, Von Hoist, and 
Schouler, must finally be accepted. Had it 
been understood during the great conflict, it is 
probable that many a flaming speech in favor 
of the hanging of the rebel leaders would have 
been less savage in its tone. 

Among the most attractive features of this 
volume are the personal sketches of eminent 
men, including Lin coin, Jefferson Davis, Robert 
E. Lee, Alexander H. Stephens, Jeremiah S. 
Black, " Stonewall " Jackson, Joseph E. John- 
ston, and others. As an example, we quote a 
part of what the author says of General Lee 
at the beginning of the War, and we quote it 
for other reasons which will appear : 

" Lee, now fifty-four years old, his face exhibiting 
the ruddy glow of health and his head without a grey 
hair, was physically and morally a splendid example of 
manhood. Able to trace his lineage far back in the 
mother country, the best blood of Virginia flowed in 
his veins. The founder of the Virginia family, who 
emigrated in the time of Charles I., was a cavalier in 
sentiment; 'Light-horse Harry' of the Revolution was 
the father of Robert E. Lee. Drawing from a knightly 
race all their virtues, he had inherited none of their 
vices. Honest, sincere, simple, magnanimous, forbear- 
ing, refined, courteous, yet dignified and proud, never 
lacking self-command, he was in all respects a true man. 
Graduating from West Point, his life had been exclu- 
sively that of a soldier, yet he had none of the soldier's 
bad habits. He used neither liquor nor tobacco, in- 
dulged rarely in a social glass of wine, and cared noth- 
ing for the pleasures of the table. He was a good en- 
gineer, and under General Scott had won distinction in 
Mexico. The work that had fallen to his lot he had 
performed in a systematic manner and with conscien- 
tious care. < Duty is the sublimest word in our lan- 
guage,' he wrote to his son. Sincerely religious, Provi- 
dence to him was a verity, and it may be truly said, he 
walked with God. ... As the years go on, we shall 
see that such a life can be judged by no partisan meas- 
ure, and we shall come to look upon him as the English 
of our day regard Washington, whom little more than a 
century ago they delighted to call a rebel. Indeed, in 
all essential characteristics, Lee resembled Washington, 
and had the great work of his life been crowned with 
success, or had he chosen the winning side, the world 
would have acknowledged that Virginia could in a cen- 
tury produce two men who were the embodiment of 
public and private virtue." 

This charming picture of a great Confeder- 
ate general suggests two instructive facts. In 
the first place, it shows how far we have drifted 



from the period of the Civil War and the ani- 
mosities which then filled the air. We recall 
some speeches in Congress and elsewhere about 
General Lee and his associates which would 
now seem as shocking and as completely out of 
tune with the times as this eulogy would have 
been during the conflict. The healing hand of 
time has done for both sections of the Union 
what no other agency could possibly have ac- 
complished, and this volume, by its fairness in 
dealing with sectional and party issues, happily 
voices the general feeling of reconciliation and 
peace. In the second place, however, there 
may be some danger of too great a reaction 
from the patriotic memories and thrilling ex- 
periences of the great struggle for the nation's 
life. Moral distinctions are never to be con- 
founded. The world will always recognize a 
difference between fighting for a slave empire 
and fighting for freedom and the universal 
rights of men. The man who violates his oath 
of loyalty to the Union cannot occupy exactly 
the same moral level with the man who keeps 
it. Besides, General Lee did not believe in 
the right of secession under the Constitution. 
He was a Union man on principle, believing 
that Virginia had a peaceable and constitu- 
tional remedy for her grievances. Neither did 
he believe in negro slavery, but regarded it as 
a great moral and political evil, and a greater 
curse to the white man than to the black. On 
his own showing, therefore, the secession of his 
native State was indefensible and unnecessary. 
The dilemma in which he was placed in having 
to choose between his loyalty to the Union and 
his duty to Virginia was a most painful one, 
and no man will now judge him harshly or un- 
charitably ; but the attempt to liken his case 
to that of Washington seems a little far-fetched, 
and is not necessary to a just appreciation of 
his remarkable public career or his rare per- 
sonal traits. GEORGE W. JULIAN. 



MODERN ART CRITICISM.* 

Some years ago a celebrated student of Ital- 
ian painting, Giovanni Morelli, went up into 
Germany and did great service to art history by 
overthrowing many of the attributions of Italian 
pictures in German galleries. He published the 
German ignorance of Italian art in several vol- 
umes, and was rewarded for his presumption by

no end of abuse from museum directors, con- 
noisseurs, and critics. Nevertheless, Morelli's 
shots struck home. The titles and ascriptions of 
many pictures were changed. Morelli was more 
often right than wrong in his judgments. He 
claimed that he was quite infallible because he 
was working with " a scientific method." The 
method was of his own adaptation. It was, 
briefly stated, based upon the theory that every 
painter was more or less conventional in his 
drawing of such details as hands, feet, ears, 
eyes, noses ; that he was largely influenced by 
his masters and associates ; that his brush-work, 
color, architecture, and landscapes were so 
many ear-marks ; and that by considering all 
these details the author of a picture could be 
surely ascertained regardless of written docu- 
ment or signature. The ancient methods of 
determining the painter of a work by intuitive 
feeling, by the personality of the work, and by 
its general spirit, were set down as ridiculously 
inaccurate. 

The application of this method to pictures was 
original with Morelli, but the method itself was 
not new. The Germans who jeered at him as 
"an ignorant Swiss Doctor" had long before his 
time applied the method to the writing of his- 
tory. Rome was done over again with " the his- 
torical method " (a rebuke to Gibbon) by drop- 
ping out the imaginative element and basing 
statements on existing documents. A study of 
the materials only could give the truth. We 
have had a recent echo of this method in Amer- 
ica in Justin Winsor's " Columbus," an excel- 
lent example of all the virtues and all the vices 
of scientific history. We know the same method 
in literary criticism. It has been unsuccess- 
fully applied to Shakespeare, but its best known 
application has been to the books of the Old 
Testament. From Eichhorn and Kuenen to 
Driver and Briggs, all the way down the line, 
the Pentateuch has been slashed at and worried 
in the name of " Higher Criticism." If we 
translate the Pentateuch into a picture and say 
that it could not have been painted by Moses 
because the style is not his, the brush-work is 
too mature, the signature is a forgery, this part 
is the work of a modern restorer, and that part 
an impudent erasure, we shall have the atti- 
tude of the biblical critics and also their rela- 
tionship to the art critics. The method is the 
same now among all " advanced thinkers." 
Everything is flatly placed on what is called a 
scientific basis at the start. We are not sur- 
prised then to find Professor Furtwangler in his 
" Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture," following 



these same methods. Indeed, he, in company 
with other German archa3ologists, has been fol- 
lowing them for years and telling us on material 
and scientific grounds what is an original, what 
is a copy, what is a variant, and what is a for- 
gery. Unfortunately, neither he nor any of 
the other scientific thinkers has told us what 
is logic. It is a great pity. Had they given 
us their notion of logic at the start, perhaps we 
should not have had occasion to find fault with 
their work. The conclusions deduced from as- 
sumed facts are the chief cause of skepticism 
and dissent on the part of the reader. 

No one doubts the long study, the intimate 
knowledge, the shrewd insight of these critics ; 
no one doubts that their scientific basis is the 
nearest to the true one that has ever been at- 
tained ; no one doubts that their researches 
have lightened many dark spots in history and 
archaeology. What one does doubt at times, 
however, is the proof of facts, the force of con- 
clusions. The journalistic way of assuming a 
point on one page and then declaring it "proven" 
on the next page, the pettifogging manner of 
slipping around a hard knot because it cannot 
be untied, the naive forming of a theory and 
then calling every fact that interferes with it 
a forgery and every dissenting critic an igno- 
ramus, are not calculated to breed confidence 
in the reasoning. And then, the vast super- 
fluity of arrogance and pretension ! From Mor- 
elli to Briggs, they are all bubbling over with 
conceit. It is not that their method is a new 
aid, sheds new light, helps on the sum of 
knowledge, and taken in connection with past 
knowledge places us on a firmer basis ; but 
their method is infallible, their say-so incon- 
testable, their conclusions final, and everything 
to the contrary is mere " leather and prunello," 
to be brushed aside. All this operates in the 
reader's mind against the method and against 
much that is incontestably true and just in the 
results. Professor Furtwangler's book, with all 
its knowledge, leaves the reader in a bad humor 
because of its arbitrary assumption, its pro- 
fessorial arrogance, its " confounded cocksure- 
ness." The editor of the volume tells us that 
it has been " received almost with acclamation 
by scholars of all schools." Very likely. It 
is so good a book that one feels vexed with its 
author that it is not better. There was need 
for a reconstructed history of Greek sculpture, 
and Professor Furtwangler's book has come at 
the right time. Had it come modestly it would 
have been the more welcome, but even in its 
present shape it is not a book to be lightly cast

aside. It is an invaluable library of critical 
research into Greek sculpture. Heretofore the 
study of Greek art has run in narrow channels. 
Professor Furtwiingler has sought to broaden 
them by reconstruction. Instead of speculation 
over the few Greek marbles that are left to us, 
he proposes to go back to the great lost orig- 
inals, by studying them in the Koman copies. 
He claims that with few exceptions (notably 
the Hermes of Praxiteles) the existing Greek 
marbles are by inferior men, whereas the Roman 
copies were copies of celebrated works by cel- 
ebrated men. He admits that there is a rich 
mine of error in discriminating between what 
is exactly reproduced and what is adapted in 
the copies, but he thinks he can avoid gross 
errors. So on this basis he starts out to recon- 
struct the art of Pheidias, from whose hand we 
have nothing that is absolutely authenticated. 
The Lemnian Athena was an original by 
Pheidias preferred by the ancients to all his 
other works. It must have been copied by the 
Romans. Two statues at Dresden are said to 
be faithful copies of it. There is a third mu- 
tilated copy in the Vatican. Professor Furt- 
wangler restores the statue by placing a helmet 
in the right hand and a spear in the left. His 
warrant for the helmet he gets from a Roman 
gem in which an Athena appears with a helmet 
put in at the side by the gem-cutter to fill space, 
and his warrant for the spear is the muscular 
play of the left arm and shoulder. He assumes 
from the technique of the copies that the origi- 
nal by Pheidias was in bronze, of life size, and 
in general like the copies. Then, after five 
pages of postulated facts, we have him saying : 
" We are now justified, I think, in claiming to 
possess exact copies after a bronze by Pheidias, 
and to have thereby gained for the first time 
a full conception of this artist's achievements 
in the round." The alleged copies which are 
said to be " faithful " and " accurate " become 
then the criterion of Pheidian style and tech- 
nique, and everything that tallies with them is 
put into the charmed Pheidian circle. So Pro- 
fessor Furtwangler goes on to tell us that the 
Dresden copy has all the " characteristic and 
personal qualities of Pheidias' Parthenos." He 
makes a comparison between the Parthenos and 
the Lemnia, and thus reestablishes the Par- 
thenos. He then pays his respects to the Olym- 
pian Zeus in the same manner, discusses the 
Parthenon frieze, and tells us what in extant 
work is Pheidian and what is not, on the pri- 
mary assumption that he has the Pheidian style 
in the alleged copies of the Lemnia. 



Now all this, covering as it does over 110 
pages, is shrewdly argued and plausibly put. 
Professor Furtwangler knows his subject so 
thoroughly knows all the technique of sculp- 
ture as well as the classic traditions that one 
is disposed to follow him wherever he leads. 
He is very likely right in his conclusions ; but 
suppose he is wrong in his first premises, what 
then becomes of his fine argument ? And what 
are his actual premises ? Lucian refers to the 
Lemnia of Pheidias. It did exist, but no work 
of Pheidias is now known to us. That it was 
copied is assumed ; that the Dresden and Vati- 
can Athenas were all copies of the original 
Lemnia, is merely a shrewd guess. On page 
76 Professor Furtwangler shows how easy it is 
to be mistaken about copies springing from a 
common original. Possibly they were not copies 
at all, but Roman eclectic works. The Romans 
did make copies of the Greek marbles, but the 
assumption that they never made anything else 
is an error. And if copies, why indisputably 
after Pheidias ? Athena was the Greek and 
Roman Madonna, and there may have been 
many conceptions of her by sculptors of rank 
whose very names are now forgotten. On page 
42 Professor Furtwangler rebukes Loschcke 
for assuming that the Zeus Talleyrand in the 
Louvre is " a copy of a work belonging to the 
middle of the fifth century B. c." This he de- 
clares is a " daring assertion." So it is, but 
not more daring than his own assertions. But 
to continue. The restorations of the alleged 
copies are probably correct, the " full concep- 
tion " of Pheidias means only a conception of 
the alleged copies. The " Pheidian circle " is 
Professor Furtwangler's circle, and " the char- 
acteristic and personal qualities of Pheidias " 
are things that have only been hinted at by 
the ancient writers. In fact, the premises are 
strewn with pitfalls, and a false step anywhere 
along the line would be sufficient to overset the 
whole argument. As speculation, as suggestion 
for future work, the theory is capital and will 
undoubtedly lead to good results ; as proven 
fact, not even the author's enthusiastic vehe- 
mence can make it wholly acceptable. 

With the Lemnia on one side of the circle 
and the Dioscuri of Monte Cavallo on the other 
side, our author thinks he has found " two fixed 
points which represent the opposite poles of 
Pheidian art." By way of additional proof he 
takes up the Parthenon marbles, the coins and 
vases, and also treats of the contemporary 
sculptors, Kresilas, Myron, and Polykleitos. 
The style of each of these men is built up, not

from originals, for there are none, but from 
Roman copies, as in the case of Pheidias. The 
allowances made for innovations and additions 
by the copyists are liberal, but possibly they 
are liberally erroneous. The general evidence, 
however, creates a probability of correctness. 
The same method is followed with the sculptors 
of the succeeding period, Skopas, Praxiteles, 
and Euphranor, though in the case of Praxiteles 
the famous original of Hermes lends more cer- 
tainty to the conclusions. The information 
thrown out in these discussions is valuable, and 
indeed, the arguments themselves are most in- 
genious and worthy of more consideration than 
can be given them in this place. The chapters 
take the form of an historical development, and 
the last chapter but one of the book is devoted 
to a new examination of the Venus of Milo. 
This is so very good, and the subject is so fa- 
miliar to all, that Professor Furtw angler's argu- 
ment should be outlined. 

With the statue of the Venus of Milo were 
found some fragments a broken arm, a hand 
holding an apple ; an inscribed plinth, which 
was at first thought to be a later addition, was 
rejected, and was finally lost. Fortunately a 
drawing of the plinth had been made. It bore 
the artist's name, Agesandros of Antioch. It 
was rejected by savants because the artist was 
unknown and the work was supposed to be of 
an excellence worthy of Praxiteles. The find- 
ing-place of the Venus and all the contradic- 
tory stories told about it are thoroughly reex- 
amined to prove the genuineness of the frag- 
ments. They undoubtedly belonged to the 
statue. The restoration is then begun by plac- 
ing the inscribed plinth at the right of the 
statue, the left foot resting upon the raised 
block. The square hole in the plinth is fitted 
with a short pillar for which abundant warrant 
is found in terra-cottas, coins, gems, and reliefs. 
The left arm and hand are adjusted to the 
figure by reference to the dowel holes, and are 
placed resting on the top block of the pillar, 
the hand holding the apple palm upward. The 
rough workmanship of the back of the hand 
(first thought an inconsistency) is now ac- 
counted for. The back of the hand turned 
downwards, and was not to be seen by the spec- : 
tator as it was originally placed. The right 
arm comes forward, and the hand clasps the 
falling drapery at the left hip. 

The uneasy motive of grasping the drapery 
with one hand and the restful motive of the 
hand loosely holding the apple are apparently 
contradictory. Professor Furtwangler explains 



it by saying that Agesandros was not entirely 
original in this work, that he borrowed two tra- 
ditional types and tried to combine them by 
modification. The motive of the left arm was 
taken from the Tyche of Melos, but the main 
design was taken from an original of which the 
Venus of Capua is the best extant copy. The 
Capuan Venus held a shield resting upon her 
left thigh, and contemplated her beauty in it as 
in a glass. Agesandros borrowed this motive 
for the Venus of Milo, except that he removed 
the shield and placed the right hand holding up 
the drapery and the left hand holding the apple. 
The action is thus apparently strained, though 
whether the strain is in the statue or in Pro- 
fessor Furtwangler's theory we are at some loss 
to determine. He thinks the whole conception 
was based upon a Skopasian Venus, but was 
somewhat exaggerated in the modification, just 
as the Venus of Praxiteles was prettified into 
the Venus de Medici. Perhaps Professor Furt- 
wangler is just a little copy-mad and cannot see 
originality in anything. The technique of the 
statue, even, he thinks is borrowed. He detects 
a lack of definition, a weakening, a relaxation 
of firmness in the forms which is indicative of 
the decadence. This, with the epigraphy of the 
inscription, allows him to date the statue between 
150 and 50 B. c. "The stylistic peculiarities 
confirm this later date," he says. The hair is 
treated in the Skopasian manner, the drapery 
in the Pheidian manner ; but the latter is imi- 
tative, like almost all of the work of the middle 
of the second century. Therefore the sculptor 
was working in the style of Skopas, but availed 
himself of the technique of Pheidias in the drap- 
ery. Perhaps, again. 

This whole theory is most interesting, but we 
doubt very much if it will be accepted as the 
final word on the Venus of Milo. In the mean 
time the Venus, the Samothracian Victory, the 
Hermes, loom colossal in their beauty, and while 
archaeologists are quarrelling over their dates, 
attributions, and restorations, how few there are 
who see the marbles with Greek eyes and appre- 
ciate their inherent excellence regardless of his- 
tory, name, or inscription. 

Professor Furtwangler has written a book and 
shown his erudition as becomes a German pro- 
fessor. It is really a learned book, and has many 
excellent features that have not been mentioned 
here. It is a book that has come to stay for a 
generation or more, and, while it is positive to 
the quarrelling point, it is not a book that the 
student of archaeology can afford to neglect. He 
may doubt here and there, but the suggestive-

SOME NEW BOTANIES.* 

Probably botanical activity has never been so great 
as during the last decade, and the notable feature of 
this activity is that it has been largely along new lines. 
The popular fancy is still too apt to regard botany as 
the "scientia amabilis," and this reputation has 
brought the study somewhat into reproach as some- 
thing not exactly serious. The science of botany, 
however, has been revolutionized, and its grasp of 
the great problems of life is both serious and fruitful. 
The sudden gush of books which are coming almost 
daily to the tables of English-speaking students, is 
due primarily to the fact that the numerous new 
lines of research have been developed far enough to 
begin to apply the results to the general subject, and 
to reconstruct ancient texts upon the basis of new 
knowledge. Botanists have waked up to the fact 
that they have no adequate expression of their science 
in existing books, notably English books, and they 
are writing and translating at a rate which bids fair 
soon to supply this deficiency. The fact of the matter 
is, no teacher of botany today is quite satisfied until he 
has written a book of his own, and publishers must 
be getting bewildered that no text they can secure 
finds very extensive sale in the schools. 

The new publications in botany are largely those 
which deal with the great departments of plant phy- 
siology, comparative morphology, and cecology. The 
most ancient subject, however, is also feeling the 
stimulus of new knowledge, and systematic botany 
has been clothed with so new a meaning that the 
ancient mummy is not to be recognized. Numerous 
notable publications on systematic botany have re- 
cently appeared, or are in the process of publication, 
but the one just now before us will serve as an illus- 
tration of the modern tendency. It is commonly 
spoken of as the Warming-Potter Botany, and is a 
translation by Professor Potter of Dr. E. Warming's 
Danish "Haandbog i den Systematiske Botanik." 
The translation is a boon to English botanists, for 
this Danish work has long been recognized as an

original and important contribution to systematic 
botany. Professor Potter has done far more than 
the work of translation, for in the revision of many 
important parts he has called in the aid of distin- 
guished authorities, notably Dr. Knoblauch for the 
Fungi, and Dr. Migula for the Bacteria. 

The classification of plants is a very old subject, 
in fact the oldest phase of botany, as it will be the 
latest. The earlier schemes, however, were artificial, 
confessedly so, and the original division into " trees," 
"shrubs," and "herbs " is hardly less artificial than 
many that have come down to us and are current in 
existing manuals. Linnaeus is usually spoken of as 
the "father of modern botany," which statement 
should be taken in a very restricted sense. His 
labors among plants were prodigious, but his results 
combined the labors of all those who worked with 
him and who had worked before him. Still, " Sys- 
tematic Botany" is using the Linnaean publications 
as the datum line, and we speak of pre-Linnaean and 
post-Linnaean times. Artificial classification culmin- 
ated in the famous twenty-four classes proposed by 
Linnaeus, an easy device for the naming of plants, 
but suggesting nothing as to their relationship. After 
Linnaeus "natural systems" began to be proposed, 
born of an increasing knowledge of plants, and the 
names of Jussieu, De Candolle, Robert Brown, End- 
licher, Brongniart, Lindley, Braun, Hofmeister, 
Bentham and Hooker, Sachs, Eichler, Engler, mark 
the development of increasingly "natural systems." 
The recent rapid advance in our knowledge of the 
life histories of plants has thrown a flood of light 
upon their phylogeny, and these recent advances Dr. 
Warming has sought to express in his manual. The 
larger outlines have been sketched for some time, 
and successive books are chiefly concerned in re- 
arranging the details, but it is astonishing with what 
persistence current manuals cling to obsolete arrange- 
ments and mislead the student. It would not be 
possible to critically compare the Warming presen- 
tation with others that have gone before and have 
appeared since, but they are all broadly alike. To 
the general reader it is a matter of greater interest 
to know what really is a modern classification of 
plants. In the book before us, five grand divisions 
are recognized, being one more than the usual number. 
The lowest division includes the "Thallophytes," 
plants which in general show no differentiation of 
the body into such vegetative organs as root, stem, 
and leaf. This lowest group has always been an un- 
certain one, for its forms are numerous and puzzling, 
and it may fairly be regarded as an artificial assem- 
blage. The three subdivisions of Thallophytes are, 
(1) the Myxomycetes, or "slime-fungi," with bodies 
of naked protoplasm which are claimed alike by 
botanists and zoologists; (2) the Algae, that great 
assemblage of aquatic plants which represent the 
first development of the plant kingdom ; (3) the 
Fungi, a host of saprophytes and parasites which by 
degenerate habits have fallen from the alga state. 
The next grand division includes the " Bryophytes," 
the mosses and liverworts, where root and stem

and leaf are for the most part worked out, but whose 
bodies are weak from lack of a supporting woody 
framework. The third division includes the first of 
" vertebrated " plants, the " Pteridophytes," where 
belong not merely the ferns, but the scouring rushes, 
the club-mosses, and certain groups that do not 
come within the common experience, but are of vast 
interest to the botanist. Pteridophytes have a woody 
framework and may attain tree-like proportions, but 
their spores are early separated from the parent, in 
a sort of oviparous fashion. The fourth and fifth 
divisions have been commonly kept together, as rep- 
resenting the great group of seed-producing plants, 
called "Phanerogams," and commonly "flowering 
plants." Flowers are not peculiar to them, however, 
as Pteridophytes also produce true flowers ; but the 
habit of retaining the spore on the parent during its 
germination, resulting in the structure known as the 
seed, a kind of viviparous habit, is peculiar to the 
group. Dr. Warming finds in the old group Phan- 
erogams sufficient diversity to raise its two usual 
subdivisions to the rank of main divisions, and hence 
" Gymnosperms," including Conifers and Cycads, be- 
come the fourth grand division, and " Angiosperms," 
the true flowering plants, the fifth and highest. It 
has long been known that the Gymnosperms are more 
closely related to the Pteridophytes than to the An- 
giosperms, and the present arrangement but empha- 
sizes this fact. It is very curious that in certain man- 
uals still current the Gymnosperms are placed in the 
very midst of the Angiosperms. To one familiar 
with the ordinary school manuals the arrangement 
of the families of Angiosperms would seem very 
strange, but it is just at this point that recent research 
appears, and, as a consequence, the old artificial 
grouping disappears. It is very evident that the old 
systematic botany, with its sets of pigeon-holes and 
its search for plant names, has been set aside, and 
that the new systematic botany deals with genetic 
relationships. 

One of the notable books of the year is Dr. Vines's 
"Text-Book of Botany." Ever since his admirable 
work on Plant Physiology, Dr. Vines has been recog- 
nized as one of our foremost teachers, and the knowl- 
edge that he had a general text-book in preparation 
created such a demand for it that the first part of 
the volume was issued separately in 1894, and was 
followed by the remaining part in 1895. The whole 
presents the most complete and compact view of mod- 
ern botany yet published. The notable feature of 
the book is that it presents a consistent terminology 
throughout, and that homologies are not disguised 
by a variable set of terms. As one approaches the 
higher plants from a study of the lower, he has been 
confronted by a morphology bred of antiquated ideas 
that has been confusing and misleading. It may 
come as a shock that " stamens "and " pistils " are 
not "male" and "female" organs, and that our 
whole conception of a "flower" was radically wrong, 
but it is just as well to have the truth presented. It 
would be impossible to present the details of such a 



book, and it can only be said that it binds the whole 
plant kingdom together in one consistent scheme. 
It is interesting to note Dr. Vines's great divisions 
of the subject of Botany. The book is divided into 
four parts, entitled (1) Morphology, (2) The Inti- 
mate Structure of Plants, (3) The Classification of 
Plants, (4) Physiology. There can be no question 
that morphology and physiology are two very dis- 
tinct and fundamental divisions of the subject, and 
that classification (better taxonomy) is a sort of 
cap-sheaf for all departments ; but anatomy and 
histology should be considered more as a means to 
an end than a great division by itself. It enters 
essentially into all work, but can hardly be said to 
have any worthy autonomy. The compound micro- 
scope is also essential in most work, but it is hardly 
worth while to have a division of " microscopy." 
The recognition of anatomy as an end, however, is 
not so surprising as the failure to recognize the great 
department of oacology. In one sense it may be 
included under physiology, but hardly more so than 
morphology could be included under taxonomy. 
This book will do more than bring to the beginning 
student the science of botany based upon the most 
recent morphology ; it will also go far towards bring- 
ing about that uniform terminology which was a 
crying need of botany. 

A most fascinating book, not only for the bot- 
anist but for the general reader also, is Mr. Oliver's 
translation of Kerner's "Natural History of Plants." 
There are to be five parts, two of which are before 
us. The work is copiously and beautifully illus- 
trated, and deals in popular style, but with scien- 
tific accuracy, with some of the most interesting 
problems in the life of plants. It is a pity that the 
translator does not give even a brief preface ex- 
planatory of the status of the work and its purpose. 
Several colored illustrations supplement the num- 
erous original woodcuts. Professor Kerner has done 
what more botanists should do : he has brought the 
most recent researches within reach of the intelli- 
gent reader, and in a style so charming that even 
the professional teacher may learn a lesson in the 
art of presentation. In the two volumes before us 
the general subjects presented are : " the living prin- 
ciple of plants," a discussion of the fascinating prob- 
lem of protoplasm and its activities ; " absorption 
of nutriment," taking up the various sources of sup- 
ply, which leads into such questions as parasitism, 
symbiosis, etc.; " conduction of food," where those 
who think they know something about the " ascent 
of sap " may find something to learn ; " formation 
of organic food," the story of the conversion of the 
mineral into the organic ; " metabolism and trans- 
port of materials," under which is described the 
inner activities of the plant ; " growth and construc- 
tion of plants "; and " plant-forms as completed 
structures." The two parts contain nearly 800 
pages, but the subjects of reproduction and distri- 
bution, to be considered in the remaining parts, are 
capable of still greater interest in presentation. It

and the rise 
of Wellington. 



" The Decline and , f Na P: 

Icon, by Viscount Wolseley, and 
The Rise o f Wellington," by Gen- 
eral Lord Roberts, form the initial volumes of a 
promising series of reprints (from the " Pall Mall 
Magazine " ) of which Messrs. Roberts Bros, of 
Boston are the American publishers. The ability 
of both the writers named to treat their respective 
themes adequately from the military standpoint 
needs no comment, while the literary competence 
of the former is amply attested by his brilliant Life 
of Marlborough. The central thesis of Lord Wol- 
seley's book is that the series of disasters, from 1812 
to the final catastrophe at Waterloo, which marked 
the declining phase of Napoleon's career were due 
to the periodic attacks of a mysterious malady to 
which he is known to have been subject during his 
later years. These attacks, resulting probably from 
overwork and other less pardonable excesses, took 
the form of sudden fits of intense lethargy and 
moral prostration, and occurred at seasons of un- 
usual nervous strain and anxiety that is to say, 
precisely at those critical junctures where his su- 
preme gift of rapid forecast and decision were most 
needed. It is known, for instance, that Napoleon 
was in a state of partial coma on the morning of 
Waterloo. Grouchy strove to see him at daybreak, 
but was unable to secure his orders until afternoon 
a most disastrous delay which enabled Blticher 
to reach the field in time the following day to give 
the French their final dispatch there. Said Van- 
damme : " The Napoleon whom we have known 
exists no more ; our yesterday's success (of Ligny) 
will have no result." Lord Wolseley does not hes- 
itate to assign this curious malady as the primary 
cause of the Emperor's overthrow at Waterloo. 
Had Napoleon, he concludes, been able to bring the 
impetuous energy of his early days to bear upon his 
grandly-conceived plan for the destruction of Wel- 
lington and Bllicher (why will the English insist on 
printing it "Blucher"?) in Belgium, the cautious 
Englishman would have at least retreated to his 
transports at Ostend, while the fiery Prussian would 
have been almost destroyed at Ligny and only too 
glad to place the Rhine between the remnants of 
his army and the victor of Jena. Lord Wolseley 's 
account of the campaigns of 1812, 1813, and 1814, 



of the Hundred Days, and of Waterloo, is necessar- 
ily concise; but it is graphic and* pithy, and in- 
formed with a soldier's enthusiasm for his calling. 
Lord Roberts's " Rise of Wellington " is really 
a compact biographical sketch, touching lightly on 
the " Iron Duke's " boyhood and youth, and more 
fully upon his military career, which naturally di- 
vides itself into three periods the Indian, the Pen- 
insular, and the one during which he commanded the 
Allied Forces in the Netherlands, and plucked a leaf 
from Napoleon's fading military laurels at Waterloo. 
Lord Roberts's style is smooth, balanced, and log- 
ical, and well adapted to his usually cool and crit- 
ical treatment of his theme. He gives an accurate 
presentment of Wellington's strong and masterful, 
if not very attractive, personality ; but we confess 
his conclusion that, as a general, the Duke was Na- 
poleon's equal, if not his superior, strikes us as al- 
most as questionable as Lord Wolseley's opinion 
that Napoleon was " by far the greatest of all great 
men." The intellectual gulf between Napoleon and 
Wellington is measured by the interval between 
genius and sound practical sense. Although he had 
the good fortune to command at Waterloo (when 
famine, the snow, and the Cossacks had reduced to 
a spectre the superb fighting force which the lib- 
eral genius of the French Revolution launchep 
against Feudalism), Wellington still shows on the 
page of history as a pygmy beside the inspired ad- 
venturer who, springing from the meanest obscurity, 
turned the torrent of the Revolution into the chan- 
nel of his private ambition, and mastered Europe. 
The little volumes are very neatly gotten up, and 
are liberally sprinkled with charts and wood-cuts. 

A pleasant little volume, brimful of 
suggestions grateful to the fancy 
these torrid days, is Miss Marie Fra- 
ser's "In Stevenson's Samoa" (Macmillan). The 
book is the outcome of a several months' sojourn 
at Apia, within easy reach of "Vailima," Mr. Steven- 
son's retreat, and affords an alluring glimpse of the 
idyllic life which so charmed the lamented genius 
who now " lies where he longed to be," at rest on 
the towering peak of Vala. Miss Fraser has natur- 
ally woven into her Samoan idyl many memories 
of her gifted neighbor, and they all bespeak the 
gracious temper and unique personal fascination 
which cast so potent a spell over those who knew 
him. Mr. Stevenson was deeply enamored of the 
primitive life about him, and would seem to have 
preferred to sever himself as completely as might 
be from the prose and ceremony of the bustling 
world to the westward. Even the library at " Vai- 
lima," with its books and pictures and suggestions 
of a renounced civilization, was formal enough to 
clog the wings of his fancy. " I can't write in that 
room," he would say, u it 's all so suitable for a lit- 
erary man drives every idea out of my head." 
So he would retreat to his work-room, a little " den " 
with bare floor and varnished walls, from whence 
could be seen the snow-white tropic birds soaring

over distant Vala, the summit of which he used to 
speak of as his final resting-place*. " This," he said, 
" is the sort of a place I can write in where noth- 
ing looks like literature. A deal table and a small 
bed are all I require ; chairs are an unnecessary 
luxury ; a mat flung on the ground is all one wants." 
So minded, he used to inveigh with comic vehe- 
mence against the untimely Europeanizing of his 
picturesque islanders especially in the matter of 
dress. His own household retainers wore, as a 
matter of right and duty, their graceful, if scanty, 
native garb ; and he was one day much scandalized 
at finding the Samoan servants of a neighboring 
English lady primly incased in "made dresses." 
His sarcastic comments thereon drew the chaste re- 
ply : " Yes, they are all clothed ; no woman shall 
come into my presence who shows any part of her 
body." " Well," continued Louis Stevenson, "I just 
blazed at her. ' Woman,' I thundered, ' is your 
mind so base that you cannot see and admire Avhat 
is beautiful in the form God Almighty created? do 
you not understand that their own dress is right 
for the climate and their simple way of living? and 
do you not see that the first thing you do on land- 
ing on this beautiful island is to pollute their minds 
and sully their modest thoughts ?" The rejoinder 
of the British Matron is not recorded. We would 
by no means imply that Miss Eraser's book is inter- 
esting solely for what it tells us of Mr. Stevenson. It 
is vivaciously written, with all the frank charm and 
gayety of the author's sex and youth. Miss Era- 
ser's story of her house-hunting and house-keeping 
adventures at Apia is very amusing ; and she draws 
an altogether engaging picture of Samoan life and 
ways so engaging, indeed, as almost to reconcile 
one to the philosophy of Jean-Jacques, as unfolded 
in the Discourses. Mr. James Payn furnishes a 
commendatory preface, and there is a frontispiece 
sketch of the family group at " Vailima." 

Significance of the In " Th . e Tragedy of Fotheringay " 
execution of Mary, (Macmillan & Co. ) the Hon. Mrs. 
queen of scots. Maxwell Scott, of Abbotsford, tells 
the story of Mary Stuart's last days, of her trial and 
execution, in a spirit of loyalty to the memory of 
one whom the author evidently looks upon as a mar- 
tyr to her religious faith. The book is based on the 
best sources for these incidents ; principally upon 
the Letters of Sir Amyas Paulet, the Queen's jailer, 
and the Journal of D. Bourgoing, her physician. 
This Journal was discovered at Cluny some years 
ago, in an anonymous copy by the French histori- 
cal writer M. Re'gis Chantelauze, who published 
the text, in 1876, at the end of a volume not unlike 
Mrs. Scott's work in scope. It is with mixed feel- 
ings that the reader turns the leaves of this book. 
There is pity for the fate of such a woman as the 
Queen of Scots, and admiration for the noble dig- 
nity with which she faced a death of, to say the 
least, ambiguous significance. She seized every oc- 
casion to suggest the idea that she was to suffer for 
her religion. When Lord Buckhurst came to warn 



her of her approaching death, she said in her reply, 
" I thank God for giving me this grace of dying in 
His quarrel. No greater good can come to me in 
this world ; it is what I have most begged of God 
and most wished for." Such words do not carry 
conviction : the case is not made out. The English 
crown, rather than " God's quarrel," seems to have 
been the centre of her schemes. Memories of 
Mary's dubious career in Scotland come in still fur- 
ther to temper one's sorrow over her later misfor- 
tunes. Since Mrs. Scott does not take up the broad 
historical questions connected with Mary's death, 
she says nothing about Mary's stanch defense of 
the " divine right " principle of the succession to 
the crown, as opposed to rights based upon par- 
liamentary decree. Probably Elizabeth, in sending 
her cousin to the block, did not realize how bad an 
example she was setting to the next generation 
of radical Puritans ; but if she could execute an 
anointed Queen for reasons of state, they would 
doubtless find it easier for similar reasons to exe- 
cute this Queen's grandson. Mary's execution is 
consequently more important, historically, as an ele- 
ment in the break-down of the monarchical prin- 
ciple than as an incident in the religious struggles 
of the sixteenth century. 

Fifth volume of The fifth volume of " The Writings 
the " Writings of Thomas Jefferson " (Putnam) 
of Jefferson." covers the period preceding the open- 
ing of the States-general, when the amiable but 
unfortunate Louis XVI., with the help of M. de La- 
fayette, was endeavoring to find a basis of settlement 
between the aristocracy and the French people ; also 
that of the launching of the American Ship of State 
under command of George Washington, with the Con- 
stitution as a compass. What a striking contrast be- 
tween the unrest and despair filling all the bounds 
of France, and the ardent expectations of four mil- 
lions of people in the New World ! Jefferson re- 
tired from the French mission in time to escape the 
bloody scenes of Paris, and was succeeded by Gou- 
verneur Morris, who sympathized with the King and 
was horrified at the anarchy which emerged from 
the ranks of the tiers etat. In this volume, the 
writings of Jefferson relating to the organization of 
the American Government, and the commercial 
treaties with Great Britain and Spain, are of chief 
interest. Out of crude suggestions and tentative 
forms grew the simple republican system under 
which we have prospered, as a people, to an extent 
surpassing all previous experience. The wish of 
John Adams, and a few others, to retain class dis- 
tinctions was overruled by the practical common- 
sense of the majority, who, Jefferson declared, 
showed genuine dignity in placing all on an equality. 
The unfortunate feature in Jefferson's career is the 
evidence of party bias of narrow judgments and 
jealousy. He could not live up to his own ideal. 
Thus, we find him saying to the Rev. Charles Clay, 
candidate for Congress in 1790, " I know you are 
too honest a patriot not to wish to see our country

some literary 



prosper by any means, though they be not exactly 
those you would have preferred," and that " It takes 
time to persuade men to do even what is for their 
own good." Yet, in brief, while he denounces the 
majority of the Washington administration for act- 
ing upon this principle, and persuades himself that 
his political opponents are monarchists in disguise, 
we see principally, in this volume, the benevolent 
and philosophical side of Jefferson, and this is 
always charming and instructive. 

The sor * of autobiography of which 
" My Literaiy Passions " (Harper) 
from Mr. itoweih. j g an exam pi e i s a l ways interesting. 

Mr. Howells is by no means the first to write upon 
the theme of " Books Which Have Influenced Me," 
but we do not just now think of anyone before him 
who has made it the subject of a whole volume. 
Mr. Howells has had many " literary passions " 
fifty, or thereabouts, to reckon only from the chap- 
ter headings and in not a few cases it is obvious 
that he has loved not wisely, but too well. What 
we particularly like about the book, aside from the 
unfailing charm of its manner, is the frankly sub- 
jective character of the record. Mr. Howells has 
elsewhere sinned not a little in attempting to pass 
off his personal likes and dislikes as objective criti- 
cism, but in the present case what he writes is just 
what it pretends to be a consecutive account of 
the books that came into his hands during his im- 
pressionable early years, and of the feelings with 
which he read them. There is an occasional touch 
of Philistinism, as in the plea more than once made 
for bowdlerizing the English classics in general, or 
of a lack of appreciation which is simply amazing, as 
in this opinion : " I do not think I should have lost 
much if I had never read ' Pericles ' and ' Winter's 
Tale.' " In the present work Mr. Howells is con- 
cerned with the books that he read, and not with 
those that he wrote, but he does have a word to say 
of his own first volume, and it is to this amusing 
effect : " The ' Poems of Two Friends ' became in- 
stantly and lastingly unknown to fame ; the West 
waited, as it always does, to hear what tho East 
should say ; the East said nothing, and two-thirds 
of the small edition of five hundred came back upon 
the publisher's hands." 

"Four Years of Novel -Reading" 
A helpful book /tr j.u\ , 

for reading-circles, (*ieatn) is an interesting educational 

tract, descriptive of the work done 
by a Reading Union in a Northumberland country 
town. The work included the reading of a certain 
number of selected novels by each member of the 
association, of meetings for discussion of the novels, 
and of the preparation of papers upon special sub- 
jects suggested by the novels. The little volume 
now published gives an account of the Union by Mr. 
Barrow, its secretary; an introduction on "The 
Study of Fiction," by Mr. R. G. Moulton ; and 
four of the papers prepared by members of the 
Union. The list of books read during the four years 



includes twenty-five titles, among which "The Wan- 
dering Jew " and " The Shadow of the Sword " 
seem strangely out of place in an otherwise care- 
fully-selected company. With each novel is given 
a number of points which the readers were partic- 
ularly called upon to notice, and the subjects of the 
debates or essays which some of them were expected 
to prepare. Thus, in the case of Hugo's " Ninety- 
three," the " points " are the absence of female char- 
acters, the respects in which the story is " character- 
istically French" (whatever that may mean), and 
Lantenac as typical of the best side of the ancicn 
regime. The " debate " is on the question of Ci- 
mourdain's condemnation of Gauvain, and the " es- 
say " on Hugo's view of the Revolution. The book 
will prove helpful to reading-circles having self- 
improvement as their aim, and suggests a means of 
culture particularly adapted to the needs of country 
towns and other small communities. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. M. C. Cooke ("Uncle Matt" upon the title- 
page) is the author of a series of five little books about 
the wild flowers, intended for the use of children. The 
books are of English origin, and published by Messrs. 
T. Nelson & Sons. Each has a colored cover and fron- 
tispiece, besides many simple cuts. The species de- 
scribed are English, but so many of them occur in this 
country that the books will be found helpful by Ameri- 
can children. The titles are these: " Down the Lane and 
Back," " Across the Common," " Through the Copse," 
" Around a Corn-Field," and " A Stroll in a Marsh." 

" Appletons' General Guide to the United States and 
Canada " makes its annual appearance a little late for 
the tourist season. The usual assurances are given that 
the work has been carefully revised to date, and we 
notice considerable evidence that such a revision has 
really been made, although the book presents much the 
same appearance as in former years. The Canadian 
section is very meagre. Although this is one of the 
most satisfactory guide-books produced in the United 
States, it is still far inferior to the Baedeker manuals, 
and might learn many lessons from them. 

A beautifully-printed aud but moderately expensive 
reissue of Mr. Henry Edward Watts's " Don Quixote " 
is in course of publication by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 
There are to be four volumes, plus a fifth in the shape 
of a biography of Cervantes. This translation is, on 
the whole, the best that we have in English, and even 
those who need no translation of the immortal romance 
will find the work almost a necessity to their libraries, 
on account of its notes and appendices, to say nothing 
of the forthcoming biography. 

A new edition of " Gradatim," prepared by Mr. W. 
C. Collar, has been published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
Some errors have been corrected, a number of the old 
anecdotes dropped, and about thirty pages of new mat- 
ter, from Mr. F. Ritchie's " Fabulfe Faciles," added. 
The same publishers issue a selection of easy Latin 
prose from Erasmus, edited by Mr. Victor S. Clark. 
We are glad to note these attempts to enlarge the read- 
ing of beginners in Latin, and trust that many more 
books of the sort will be forthcoming.

LITERARY NOTES. 



A translation of Kenan's " Ma Soenr Hentiette " will 
soon be issued by Messrs. Roberts Brothers. 

A pretty, limited edition, at a moderate price, of Fitz 
Gerald's "Oinar" will be published in a few weeks by 
the E. W. Porter Co., of St. Paul. 

Smollett's "Peregrine Pickle," in four volumes, has 
just been added to the charming edition of that novelist 
which is sold in this country by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

Beginning with the May number, Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co. will issue in the United States the monthly peri- 
odical " Science Progress," well-known and successful 
in England. 

Mr. Sidney Colvin's biography of Stevenson need not 
be expected for two years or thereabouts, but a volume 
of the novelist's correspondence is promised for the 
coming season. 

" The New Galaxy " is the title of a new ten-cent 
monthly magazine, published by Mr. Harry C. Jones, 
favorably known as editor and publisher of "The 
Monthly Illustrator." 

"The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan," by 
James Morier, has been added to the Macmillan reprints 
of popular oldtime fiction. It has an introduction by 
the Hon. George Curzon. 

An authorized translation of Dr. Paulson's " Intro- 
duction to Philosophy," prepared by Professor Frank 
Thilly, of the University of Missouri, with a preface by 
Professor William James of Harvard, is to be published 
immediately by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

The Committee of Twelve of the American Philolog- 
ical Association have issued an address in support of 
their contention that " not less than three years of in- 
struction in Greek should be required " in our second- 
ary schools as preparation for the classical college course. 

" A Reformate Wordsworthian " writes from Trinity 
College, Dublin, to the " Saturday Review," apropos of 
the poetical vocabulary of Mr. Francis Thompson, in 
the following terms: "SiR, Could we not touch up 
the more popular songs of the obsolete poets so as to 
make them intelligible to the admirers of illuminate 
and volute redundance ' ? Mr. Francis Thompson has 
enriched the English language with words like acerb, 
crocean, ostends, lampads, preparate (for ready), reform- 
ale (for reformed), and many equally desiderable latinate 
vocabules. Might we not, by following Mr. Thomp- 
son's method, add some degree of ' literary gorgeous- 
ness ' even to the least Thompsonian of our poems ? 
For instance, certain well-known verses would be re- 
deemed from much of their sordid quietude if presented 
thus: 

By fonts of Dove, ways incalcable, 

Did habitate 

A virgin largely inamable 
And illandate. 

A violet by a muscose stone 

Semi-occult, 
Formose as astre when but one 

Ostends its vult. 

She lived incognite, few could know 

When she cessated. 
But O the difference when, lo, 

She 's tnmnlated. 

Much obsolete poetry might thus be brought up to 
date." If this be not the hand of Professor Tyrrell, we 
lose our guess.

THE STORY OF BESSIE COSTRELL. 

By Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD. Uniform with " Marcella." 1 vol., 12mo, cloth, 75 cents. 

" It is the best work Mrs. Ward has done." Philadelphia Press. 

"Mrs. Ward's new story is one of the daintiest little gems I have come across in my weekly literature hunt." ALAN 
DALE, in the New York World. 

" The piece of fiction under consideration is the best short story presented in many years if not in a decade. . . . Pre- 
sented so thrillingly and graphically, we cannot avoid pronouncing this short tale a masterpiece." Elmira Telegram. 

" Every one who did not follow the story as it came out in the magazine will be glad of its appearance in book form, and 
it will find a wide reading, not only for the interest and originality of the story, but for the curiosity of seeing the author in 
an entirely new vein. As it stands completed it bears the unmistakable mark of an artist's hand. In every way a remark- 
ably human and lifelike portraiture, which will take its place as a small but brilliant gem in the distinguished author's literary 
crown." Boston Courier. 

"Mrs. Ward has done nothing finer than this brief story. The sustained interest, which does not permit the reader to 
miss a line ; the vivid clearness in which each character stands out in self-revelation ; the unfailing insight into the familiar 
and confused workings of the village mind all represent work of the highest class. ' The Story of Bessie Costrell ' will 
become an English classic." Christian World. 

" There are masterly touches and striking sentences in many pages of this little volume. . . . Mrs. Humphry Ward's 
admirers will say that she has seldom written with more force than in describing the tardy remorse of the hard, unrelenting 
husband." London Times. 

" Every page shows it to be the work of an artist. The observations of the trained eye, the touches of the skilled writer, 
are all there, and what I like in the story is that no words are wasted in the telling. . . . The interest is too strong for one to 
lay the book down until it is finished. Mrs. Ward has never written anything more dramatic than this story ; the agony of 
Old John over his loss, the tragedy of Bessie's end, thrill the reader as few stories succeed in doing, though many of them 
make greater efforts." New York World.

By AUBTN TREVOB-BATTTK, F.L.S., F.Z.S., etc. With nu- 
merous Illustrations and Drawings, and 3 Maps. Large 8vo,

" The Btory is told in a delightfully simple and spontaneous manner. 
Mr. Trevor-Battye's simple and unaffected narrative enables us to 
learn a good deal." London Times. 

"From beginning to end the story of this adventure is outside the 
common lines. It is a tale of success of an odd kind." Spectator. 

" A volume enjoyable for its manner as it is interesting for its mat- 
ter." Glasgow Herald.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITER A TURE II. 

The condensation of the " Athenaeum " sum- 
mary of European literary productivity dur- 
ing the past year, begun in our last issue, will 
now be completed by a consideration of the re- 
ports from Italy and Spain, Greece and Hun- 
gary, Bohemia, Poland, and Russia. 

That a new poet has arisen in Italy is the 
cheering announcement of the Commendatore 
Bonghi, who writes of things Italian in this 
series of articles. Sig. Giovanni Pascoli, a pro- 
fessor at Leghorn, is the individual in question, 
and his volume is called " Myricae " a sug- 
gestion of the Virgilian 

"Non onmes arbusta juvant humilesque myricse." 

Chastity and simplicity are the leading notes of 
this poet, although the simplicity is of thought 
rather than of style. Sig. Alfredo Bacelli's 
" Vittime e Rebelli " is also a meritorious vol- 
ume of verse, and not as socialistic as the title 
would indicate. Sig. Carducci's ode to the city 
of Ferrara, written on the occasion of the ter- 
centenary of Tasso's death, is, of course, the 
most important poetical product of the year in 
Italy. The Tasso celebration, indeed, " has 
been the principal literary excitement of the 
twelve months," and has evoked many publica- 
tions. Chief of these is the three-volume work 
by Professor Solerti, which includes both the 
life and the correspondence of the poet. Other 
Tasso publications are : three volumes of Sig. 
Solerti's critical edition, Sig. Prinzivalli's"Tor- 
quato Tasso a Roma " and " Torquato Tasso 
nella Vita e nelle Opere," Sig. Prote's " Rin- 
aldo," and Sig. Carducci's critique of the 
" Aminta." Only one novel of the year is found 
deserving of praise, that one being Sig. Rovet- 
ta's "La Baraonda," an "exceedingly clever 
picture of the coulisses of political life." " Pic- 
coli Schiavi Bianchi," by Sig. G. Errico, is a 
collection of short stories "dealing with the 
troubles and sorrows of the poorer classes." 
The following paragraph about Sig. d'Annun- 
zio is of considerable interest : " According to 
a French interviewer, he is now contemplating 
a series of novels which will be called ' I Gigli.' 
He intends to publish these exclusively in 



84 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



French, because he thinks that only French 
readers have ever really understood him. This 
is as good as saying that he does not wish these 
novels to appear in his own language. Never- 
theless the first of the series, ' La Vergine alle 
Roccie,' is undoubtedly coming out in ' II Con- 
vito,' a very dainty periodical, in which the 
school of ' Young Italy ' displays its prowess. 
I cannot pretend to criticize it, as ' II Convito ' 
is at present only in its third number, and it is 
impossible to say how ' La Vergine ' will turn 
out." 

Don Juan Riano, writing of Spain, begins 
with an account of the work being done by the 
Royal Academy of History, and the remarka- 
ble activity recently shown in historical, archae- 
ological, and topographical fields. Even the 
novelist, Senor Galdos, figures in this depart- 
ment with his " Cuarenta Leguas por Canta- 
bria." The colonies also continue to occupy 
the attention of many writers. " Columbus's 
quatercentenary has passed away, and yet most 
of the periodical publications, collections of 
documents, reviews, and so forth, started on 
account of it, go on still printing papers and 
tracts (nay, works in three or more volumes) 
exclusively relating to America." Senor Du- 
puy de Lome has recently published an account 
of the war between China and Japan. Spanish 
poetry is in a state of decay, and the " long- 
winded epic " seems " doomed to disappear alto- 
gether." In the drama, there have been two 
comedies by Senior Echegaray " La Monja 
Descalza " and " Mancha que Limpia." The 
" Teresa " of Senor Alas and the dramatization 
of " Torquemada y San Pedro," by Senor Gal- 
dos, have both proved failures. Some plays 
have been written in Catalan and produced at 
Barcelona, and we are told that the Catalan is 
" spreading more than ever in the eastern prov- 
inces of the Peninsula." In fiction, Senor 
Pereda's " Penas Arriba " and Senor Valera's 
" La Buena Fama " have been well received, 
while the great success of the year has been 
Father Coloma's " Retratos de Antano," which 
is rather more history than fiction, and might 
fairly be called "Memoirs of the Court of 
France at the End of the Eighteenth Century." 
The author closes with a somewhat lengthy dis- 
cussion of Cervantes literature and the prob- 
lems recently raised in connection with the im- 
mortal author of " Don Quijote." The most 
important book in this department seems to be 
" Cervantes Vascofilo," a vindication from the 
charge that Cervantes thought and wrote dis- 
paragingly of the Basques. 



We do not expect much literature from mod- 
ern Greece, but Professor Lambros gives us 
an interesting article upon the subject. Among 
the books which he enumerates are a treatise 
on " Greek Metres," by Professor Semitelos ; 
a " History of Greek Literature," by Professor 
Mistriotis ; some " Studies of Byzantine His- 
tory from the First to the Final Conquest of 
Constantinople," by Mr. Paul Callegas ; a 
" History of Athens from the Birth of Christ 
to A. D. 1821," by Mr. George Constantinides ; 
a work on " Popular Cosmographic Myths," 
dedicated to Professor E. Curtius by the au- 
thor, Professor Nicolaus Politis ; and the second 
volume of the " Memoirs of Alexander Rhan- 
gabe," coming down to 1856. " Most engag- 
ingly, sometimes imaginatively, written, this 
book helps to illuminate the history of modern 
Greece, more especially of its civilization, and 
furnishes much that is novel with regard to 
those incidents in which the author himself 
bore a part." In belles-lettres, there is little 
that is noteworthy. Mr. Ephtaliotis has pro- 
duced a collection of dialect " Island Stories," 
and Mr. Passojannis, in his " First Fairy 
Tales," a volume of dialect popular legends. 
The tragedy of " Fausta," by Mr. D. Bernard- 
akis, is the foremost poetical work of the year. 

The celebration, last February, of Herr 
Jokai's seventieth birthday provides Herr M. 
L. Katscher with an appropriate introduction 
to his report upon Hungarian literature. Thirty 
volumes have appeared of the " jubilee edition " 
of Jokai, to be followed by seventy more. Of 
Herr Brody, perhaps "our second-best novelist," 
a twelve - volume edition has been published, 
besides a new novelette, " Snow-white." The 
following new works of fiction are noteworthy : 
" Occidental Tales," by Herr Here/eg ; " The 
Destruction of Nineveh," by Herr Ambrus ; 
" King Midas," by the same author ; " The Key 
of the Temple," by Herr Tabori ; and " The 
Life of the Pohblys," by Herr Gardonyi. Sev- 
eral volumes of poetry are briefly characterized, 
and two or three plays, among the latter Herr 
Varady's iambic tragedy of " Charitas." " Its 
diction is splendid." " In anticipation of the 
millennial celebration, in 1896, of the founda- 
tion of Hungary, a grand ' Millennial National 
History of Hungary ' is being issued in many 
volumes, three of which have already seen the 
light. It is being written by various eminent 
historians Professor Marczali among the rest 
splendidly got up, illustrated with thousands 
of pictures, excellently edited by Herr Sandor 
Szilagyi, and published by the Hungarian 



1895.]

85 



Athenaeum Society. The same Society issues 
a similar monumental work by many writers, 
entitled ' Illustrated History of Literature,' and 
having a biographical basis." 

Bohemia, too, has had its literary centennial 
during the year, according to Dr. J. Krejci, 
this honor having been bestowed upon the 
memory of Paul Joseph Safarik, historian, 
archaeologist, and philologist. As for the lit- 
erature of the twelvemonth, it is rich in belle- 
tristic work. " Two volumes of verse, ' Here 
Roses ought to Blow ' and ' Magdalena,' by 
Mr. J. S. Machar, are the most conspicuous 
productions of last year. The former contains 
a series of beautiful lyrics, passages from the 
lives of suffering women ; the latter, scenes 
from the romance of a girl who, without any 
fault of her own, had been thrown into the 
gutter." Mr. Svatopluk Cech's " Songs of a 
Slave " is a volume that has gone through 
twenty-three editions in three or four months. 
" Freedom and liberty are the writer's themes, 
and therefore the interest his verses have awak- 
ened is easily explained, considering our pecu- 
liar political circumstances. His lyrics have 
an eminently political tendency the author 
has himself acknowledged this and they have 
struck the right chord." Many other books of 
poetry are named, but those we have mentioned 
seem the most important. Bohemian writers 
of fiction have been " especially diligent in 
writing stories of family and country life." 
" Mr. A. E. Muzik's ' Euins of Life ' contains 
some simple but touching pictures of human 
misery. Mr. K. V. Rais describes in * Forgot- 
ten Patriots ' some of the best and noblest, 
though unacknowledged workers in the national 
cause. The same author's pictures of highland 
life, under the title of ' Toil,' are marked by 
the warm-hearted feeling which characterizes 
him. Mr. Klostermann's story ' From the 
World of Forest Solitudes' introduces the 
reader to the depths of the Bohemian Forest, 
while another of his tales, perhaps the best of 
them, ' In Search of Good Fortune,' treats of 
the life of Bohemians who reside in Vienna, 
which is to many of them a foreign soil." The 
works of the savants are mostly continuations 
or new editions, and Bohemian scholarship is 
also represented by new historical and geo- 
graphical reviews. 

Dr. Belcikowski tells us, what we might have 
been shrewd enough to guess, that " The Pol- 
aniecki Family," by Mr. Sienkiewicz, is the 
most important contribution to the Polish lit- 
erature of the year. Under the title " Children 



of the Soil," this work was reviewed by us some 
weeks ago. The following paragraph embodies 
the most important remaining news of Polish 
fiction : " Mr. J. Zacharyasiewicz, who has just 
celebrated his fortieth year of literary work, is 
still, in spite of his years, busy, maintaining his 
well-merited reputation by new efforts, and has 
in the last twelve months brought out three 
new volumes : ' Under the Three Govern- 
ments,' ' Orion and Chrysanthema,' a cutting 
satire on the naturalistic school of the present 
day, and above all, the novel ' Bread,' to which 
the political condition in recent years of Prus- 
sian Poland forms a background that is de- 
picted with much skill. In a similar manner, 
but with a considerable infusion of satire, the 
celebrated Mr. T. T. Jez has in his romance 
' Elizabeth ' portrayed the condition of Gali- 
cia." Besides these novels, mention is made 
of " Begun in the Morning," a " combination 
of realistic truth with a cheerful optimism," by 
Mr. Gawalewicz ; " Cotton," a story of an in- 
dustrial town, by Mr. Kosiakiewicz ; and " The 
Golden Chains " of Mr. Gomulicki, " the 
highly esteemed lyrical poet and writer of short 
stories." The drama has not flourished of late 
in Poland, only a few second-rate plays being 
named ; on the other hand, Mr. Kaszewski has 
made a new translation, " which meets all ar- 
tistic and literary requirements," of the trag- 
edies of vEschylus. Mr. K. Tetmajer has come 
to the front with a new volume of poems. " He 
possesses a powerful fancy and integrity of 
feeling, yet most of his poems express an inner 
doubt and skepticism or an intoxication of the 
senses." " Sobieski before Vienna " is a note- 
worthy poem by " Deotyma," a lady of the later 
Romantic School. Finally, we must not fail to 
record the completion of the four-volume life 
of Mickiewicz, by his son. 

The last country upon our list is Russia, and 
Professor Paul Milyoukov is the correspondent 
from the great Empire of the North. Fully 
half of his article is devoted to an account of 
economic and social discussion, the general ten- 
dency of which, in Russia, appears to be rather 
toward collectivism in one form or another. In 
belles-lettres " the past year has produced noth- 
ing of capital importance." A novel by Mr. Bob- 
urikin (not named), one by Mr. Mamin-Sibir- 
iak, entitled " Bread," and Count Tolstoy's 
" Master and Man," are the chief representa- 
tives of the year's fiction. Mr. Korolenko, who 
recently made a trip to England and America, 
has published " A Free Fight in the House," 
a semi-literary commentary on a well-known

incident in the House of Commons "; and 
" Without a Tongue," which is " descriptive 
of a charming and touching incident in the life 
-of some Western Russian peasant emigrants, 
hopelessly lost amidst what was to them the 
strange population of New York." Amongst 
scholarly works, special prominence is given to 
*' The Origins of Contemporary Democracy," 
by Mr. Kovalevski ; and " The Russian His- 
torical Epos," by Mr. Jdanof. The following 
facts seem to us of peculiar significance : " The 
great awakening of interest in reading and self- 
culture in all classes of society, to which I re- 
ferred in my last article, is confirmed this year 
by observation and facts. Inquiries amongst 
people connected with and interested in rural 
schools have revealed the existence everywhere 
of a profound interest in education amongst 
the rural population. The interest taken by 
the higher classes of the reading public is 
brought to light in the recently issued work by 
Mr. Rubakin entitled 'A Study of the Russian 
Reading Public,' as well as by the great suc- 
cess attained by the Moscow Commission for 
the Organization of Home Reading, which has 
scarcely commenced work and has already 
issued three editions of its 'Programme of 
Home Reading,' or about 25,000 copies. Be- 
sides endeavoring to give a direction to home 
reading, the Commission has made the first at- 
tempt to introduce another form of university 
extension by causing public lectures to be de- 
livered in the provinces by travelling lecturers. 
Parallel with this movement the issue of pop- 
ular works on science has made great strides, 
though these are as yet principally transla- 
tions." 



THE RECENT DEATH ROLL. 

Few men have so endeared themselves to the 
American people as Dr. George F. Root of Chicago, 
who died at his summer home on the Maine sea- 
coast, the sixth of this month. To " write the songs 
of the people " has been held by excellent authority 
to be a nobler function than that of the statesman ; 
and Dr. Root was our song-writer at a time when 
song was most needed. Not a composer of music 
in any very high sense, he yet knew what chords 
would find responsive echo in the popular heart, and 
his gift was not grudgingly bestowed. "Tramp, 
Tramp, Tramp " and The Vacant Chair " and " The 
Battle Cry of Freedom " are as much a part of our 
lives^as "America" and "The Star Spangled Ban- 
ner," and we shall not forget to cherish the mem- 
ory of the man to whom we owe them. 



On the first of August the news came of the death 
of Heinrich von Sybel, the great German historian, 
at the age of seventy-seven. He was born in 1817, 
at Diisseldorf, and studied at Berlin under Ranke. 
He occupied chairs at Bonn, Marburg, and Munich. 
He also took a prominent part in politics, joining 
forces with the liberals. His greatest work is his 
"Geschichte der Revolutionszeit," in five volumes, 
brilliant in style and sound in scholarship, which 
mainly occupied him for a score of years. He also 
wrote an "Entstehung des Deutschen Konigthums," 
and numerous books of less importance. He was 
the founder, in 1856, of the "Historische Zeitschrift," 
and director of the Prussian State Archives. 

The death of Julius Zupitza, on the sixth of July, 
coming so soon after the loss of Ten Brink, is a 
heavy blow to English scholarship in Germany. 
Born in 1844, he died at the early age of fifty-one. 
His academic posts were at Oppeln, Breslau, Vienna, 
and Berlin, and he filled the latter for nearly twenty 
years. His English studies were very numerous, 
and among them we should mention his edition of 
the " Elene," his " ^Elfric's Grammar," his fac- 
simile " Beowulf," and his " Romance of Guy of 
Warwick." One of his English friends thus writes 
of him in " The Athenaeum ": " He was a highly 
gifted, enthusiastic, yet methodical teacher, lucid 
in exposition, painstaking, extremely kind, encour- 
aging, and helpful. He had the highest conceptions 
of the aims of university teaching and study ; his 
instruction was eminently effective, yet he never 
stooped to using merely utilitarian methods of in- 
struction. He always insisted on the absolute neces- 
sity of a truly scientific study of the English lan- 
guage and literature in their historical development, 
but he no less insisted on his students gaining a 
thorough knowledge of the present state of the lan- 
guage and of the masterpieces of modern literature, 
and he would urge them to make themselves familiar 
with English life and manners, if possible, by visits 
to this country." 



Mr. G. C . MACAULAY, whose discovery of a manuscript 
claimed to be the lost French poem of Gower we noted 
some weeks ago, now writes to the " Academy " sum- 
marizing the reasons in support of his claim. He says, 
in part: "The title, the number of divisions, and the 
contents of the book, all correspond exactly with the 
account given by Gower of his own work. The author 
is an Englishman and a layman, and the French in 
which he writes is the same in all essential points with 
that of Gower's acknowledged French poems. At the 
same time, in its style and manner of treatment, this 
book most strikingly resembles the other acknowledged 
works of Gower. Finally, the book abounds with pas- 
sages which occur also in the ' Confessio Amantis ' or in 
the ' Vox Clamantis,' and of the few stories which it 
contains most are reproduced in the ' Confessio Aman- 
tis.' " Mr. Macaulay's argument, which is developed 
at much length, and enforced by copious quotations 
from the newly-discovered poem, may be found in " The 
Academy " for July 27 and August 3.

ix TUDOR TIMES.* 



Mr. Traill's third volume f carries the story 
of England's progress forward through the six- 
teenth century the century of Henry the 
Eighth and Elizabeth ; of Wolsey and Thomas 
Cromwell ; of Erasmus, Colet, and Sir Thomas 
More ; of William Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, 
and Sir Francis Drake ; of Cranmer, Hugh 
Latimer, William Tyndale, and John Knox ; 
of the group of poets and prose writers whose 
work gave the name of Augustan to this period 
of English literature. It is a century full of 
adventure and of change, of things to interest 
and of things to instruct. Great names and 
great deeds crop out over it, as " Ik Marvel " 
has said, as thickly as leaves grow in summer. 
It is the first century of distinctively modern 
times ; the period when the transition from the 
spirit of medievalism to that of modern com- 
merce was becoming manifest, and not only 
changes were taking place in the industrial and 
the political world, but revolutions were devel- 
oping in the religious, and above all in the so- 
cial, life of the people, revolutions which 
brought into England a " new learning " and a 
Renaissance, a new church and a new state, a 
new home and a new school, a new industrial 
relation and commercial connection, and a new 
society. Thus is evident at once the need and 
the difficulty of a scientific treatment of the 
facts and factors of this great period, as afford- 
ing a guide to the work of present-day social 
reform. 

Mr. Traill's purpose is clearly manifested in 
the titles he has given to the successive chap- 
ters : " The Old Order Changed," The New 
Forces," The New Order," and " The Ex- 
pansion of England." He and his co-laborers 
seek to show how the preceding causes made 
subsequent results inevitable. They endeavor 
to separate the forces which were fundamental 
and permanent, from the temporary incidents 
in the story. They fail in this, just because 
the controversial character of the period makes 
the personal equation more difficult to calcu-

late ; as it is for this very reason that history 
has constantly to be rewritten. Each succeed- 
ing generation, and each new reading of the 
inscriptions on the walls, makes possible a 
clearer view of the essential elements in human 
progress. 

The real historical significance of Tudor 
absolutism lies in the fact that by it England 
was steered safely through the revolutionary 
period of the sixteenth century. The storm of 
feudal controversy in the Wars of the Roses 
had prepared the way ; the culmination of the 
change, as the nations of Europe passed from 
the mediaeval to the modern mould, made the 
strong central power unnecessary. Before his 
death Henry VIII., " without an army, without 
an independent revenue, with no open breach 
in constitutional forms, was exercising over a 
nation, still proud of its instincts of freedom 
and jealous of political innovation, a self-willed 
authority that amounted to a real despotism " 
(p. 1). Men like Wolsey and Cromwell were 
instruments in his hands to be used in the 
building of a fabric of absolutism against which 
neither the Church nor Parliament, neither the 
aristocracy nor the third estate, was in a posi- 
tion to make a stand. 

" The bishops' courts, the privileges of sanctuary and 
clergy, had all been 'blown upon' under Henry VII.; 
and now the vast wealth and separate Parliament of the 
clerical estate, its alleged ownership of one-fifth of En- 
glish land, its dominance in the peerage (where the 
spiritual lords still numbered forty-eight out of eighty- 
four), its hold on political power through the almost 
unbroken succession of clerical ministers, as chancellors, 
keepers, and presidents of council, all provoked the cry 
Restrain ' " (p. 49). 

So Henry restrained. The new church be- 
came dependent on the crown, and the great lay 
classes gained a social victory over the clerical 
estate which they have ever since maintained. 
The new nobility was entirely dependent upon 
the crown. 

" A personal nobility, indebted for their rank, their 
emoluments, their importance, and their employment, 
to their personal services about the king, enriched by 
wardships, by marriages, by forfeitures, by steward- 
ships in the royal demesnes, continually augmented by 
impeachments of the older houses, owed everything 
to the king. ... As time went on, the ranks of the 
nobility were opened to merchants, lawyers, borough 
magistrates, and manufacturers, men who, risen from 
small fortunes, had been enriched by the confiscation of 
the monastic property. And thus it came about that 
from the ranks of the courtiers and from the middle 
classes arose a nobility which owed its position to wealth 
or to the favor of the king a nobility which was for 
many years utterly powerless to check the absolutism 
of the crown" (p. 32). 

Perhaps the chief practical significance of a 



88 



[Aug. 16, 



study of this century lies, however, in the light 
it throws on the lines of commercial develop- 
ment. A revolution was going on, in agricul- 
ture and industry, which Henry was powerless 
to direct, although his ministers set themselves, 
all through the reign, to oppose the current 
tendency, and they were supported by all the 
preachers and thinkers of the day. Growing 
wool had become profitable and a commercial 
spirit was thus infused into agriculture, of 
which the results were twofold : " First, the 
breaking up of the old agrarian partnerships, 
in which lords of the manor, parsons, yeomen, 
farmers, copyholders, and laborers were asso- 
ciated for the supply of the wants of the vil- 
lages ; and, secondly, the substitution of pas- 
turage for tillage, and of sheep for corn 
[wheat]." This led to extensive enclosures of 
common land and to an entirely new relation- 
ship between lord and tenant. "Under the 
old system, it was open to the idleness of one 
man to cripple the energy of fifty others. 
To exchange, divide, enclose, and so consol- 
idate the holdings, became the object of the 
rural aristocracy" (p. 353). This movement 
was greatly aided, consequently, by Henry's 
schemes of confiscation from monastery and 
guild. In the mean time, manufacturing towns 
were springing up. 

" Whilst the old corporate ' towns are decaying, the 
'villages' of Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield 
were growing in importance, partly, no doubt, because 
they were comparatively free from vexatious restric- 
tions. Parliament vainly tried to compel people to 
work in the old towns. Economic forces were too strong 
for the Government ; in fact, the mediaeval organiza- 
tions of labor were breaking down on all sides. The 
rise in the price of wool was inducing landlords to turn 
their arable land into pasture, and this change involved 
extensive ejectments of agriculturists " (p. 121). 

The growth of the spirit of commercialism 
among Englishmen in the sixteenth century is 
evidenced further in the changed feeling re- 
garding the taking of interest (usury). The 
class of capitalist artisans was now developing 
into a class of capitalist employers ; a market 
was thus created for the productive use of 
wealth belonging to others. The mutually bene- 
ficial agreement to share the profits of the en- 
terprise, and gradually to take a definite per- 
centage on the capital as " interest," was the 
inevitable result. The forces compelling it lie 
behind all government, deeply buried in the 
springs to human activity. Law may direct 
the current which it is entirely helpless to 
abolish. This principle is further illustrated 
by the laws which debased the currency so rap- 



idly and on so great a scale that the shilling 
issued in 1551 contained less than one-seventh 
of the amount of fine silver in the shilling of 
1527. This naturally threw prices and wages 
into confusion. A great temptation to coun- 
terfeiters aggravated the difficulty of estimat- 
ing how far the rapacity and ignorance of the 
dishonest Council might carry debasement of 
the coin. All this was superadded to the change 
which must have come with the increase in the 
supply of the money metals resulting from the 
Spanish conquests in America. It thus hap- 
pened that the upper and middle classes derived 
almost the whole of the increased wealth in the 
sixteenth century. 

All transitions from one industrial pursuit 
to another are attended with much misery to a 
large body of the laborers. In this instance, 
the government persistently interfered to make 
it harder for agricultural laborers to adapt 
themselves to the new conditions. The late 
Professor Rogers goes so far as to hold that 
even in this century the laborers of England 
have not recovered the level of the halcyon 
days of the fourteenth, from which Tudor des- 
potism degraded them. 

The classes immediately above the wage- 
earners, which included small farmers, shop- 
keepers, and the small employers, naturally 
profited greatly by the rise in prices, and they 
greatly increased, both in numbers and wealth, 
during the reign of Elizabeth. 

" Among the upper classes, too, we find many evi- 
dences of increased prosperity. The rise in rents was 
not, indeed, proportionate to the general rise in prices; 
but the upper classes invested largely in the trading and 
buccaneering enterprises of the time, which, in spite of 
frequent losses, brought in on the whole very advan- 
tageous returns. Moreover, owing to the spread of 
commerce, the prices of many luxuries from abroad ac- 
tually fell, while others only slightly advanced. The 
upper classes now lived in houses built of brick or stone, 
with chimneys and glass windows, carpets, cushions, and 
other comforts, which had been, before Elizabeth's 
reigu, almost unattainable luxuries; and there was a 
corresponding improvement in their dress and in their 
food" (p. 548). 

It is the articles dealing with food and dress, 
with manners and customs, amusements, and 
the like, and contributed to this volume by 
Miss Bateson, that give the reader the best 
view of social England. Human life is a 
growth, a development, an unfolding. Nowhere 
is this life more clearly registered than in the 
everyday affairs. Civilization is revealed in 
the social habits of people in the large cities.

DARWINISM AND RACE PROGRESS.* 

It is easy for most persons to admit a great 
scientific principle in a general way, without 
realizing what its application to details really 
involves. Many, who unhesitatingly accept 
the great Darwinian principle of Natural Selec- 
tion, probably have not thought of applying it 
to sociological questions. Professor Haycraft, 
in his little book, " Darwinism and Race Pro- 
gress," makes such an application. 

Race and nation are widely different words. 
A nation may rise and fall without the race or 
races interested in it being profoundly affected. 
Our author says : 

"It would be quite impossible for our Empire to 
crumble away from us. It is a political organization 
dependent upon ties of mutual advantage and sentiment 
and likewise upon the tolerance and weakness of other 
nations. But we may lose our colonies and be stripped 
of our prestige, and yet remain, man for man, as fine 
individually as when we gained them; for bone, mus- 
cle, and brain are one thing, whilst the political union 
that binds us together is another." 

To improve race is the problem. Before we 
can solve it, we must know the laws of racial 
change. The fundamental law is selection. It 
should have free course ; the unfit must die, 
the fit must survive. Nature works constantly 
to such results. Haycraft says, " leprosy ex- 
terminates the unhealthy," " phthisis and scrof- 
ula are social friends," " if we stamp out in- 
fectious diseases we perpetuate poor types." 
We are prone in these days of science to point 
with pride to what we are doing to prolong 
human life. We speak of a lengthening life 
average, we decrease infant mortality by im- 
proved sanitation, we rob smallpox of its ter- 
rors by inoculation. All of this is interesting ; 
nay more, it is wonderful achievement. But 
what is undoubtedly individual gain is racial 
loss. Lengthening the life of the weak or unfit 
increases the chances of their leaving behind 
them weak and unfit progeny. When pesti- 
lence sweeps a land but few physically able 
persons succumb ; the survivors are usually the 
ones whose progeny is desirable. Reducing 
quantity, the pestilence has distinctly improved 
quality. The statement appears harsh, but is 
it not true ? 

Take a single well-known disease consump- 
tion. Of it our author says : 

" Now this phthisical type is very common with us 
indeed, and it appears to be an innate variation to which 

* DARWINISM AND RACE PROGRESS. By John Berry Hay- 
craft. " Social Science Series." London : Swan Sonnen- 
schein & Co. (Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons, New 
York. ) 



our race is liable. It is evident, therefore, that those 
people with the tuberculous variation who, even under 
the present circumstances, manage to contribute their 
quota to the population, would, were the bacillus tuber- 
culosus altogether exterminated, contribute more than 
their share, and the type would become more common. 
And let it be remembered that this type, apart from 
the action of the bacillus, is a delicate and fragile one 
and liable to other affections, and the effect of giving 
the type any advantage in the struggle for life would 
surely imperil the well-being of the future of the race." 

" The finest races are bred by hardship." Hard- 
ship destroys the fragile and. weak, leaving the 
strong, hardy, and vigorous to continue the race. 
The race begins already to feel the results 
of preventive medicine. Insanity and nervous 
derangement increase wherever civilization goes 
with germicides, inoculation, and sanitation. 
Well-meant agitations and reforms tend to dan- 
gerous ends. What is alcoholism ? " a habit, 
a sign of mental instability." "Drink is a 
selective agency " destroying early and surely 
a class of persons whose continued existence is 
a menace to the race. Drunkenness is symp- 
tomatic of unbalancement. What results must 
follow and have followed prohibitory legisla- 
tion ? In Maine we find insanity, pauperism, 
crime, on the increase at an abnormally large 
rate ; in Kansas " there were more prisoners 
in its penitentiary and county jails in propor- 
tion to population in 1890 than there were in 
1880," and it has a larger ratio of prisoners 
to population than its neighboring states ; in 
an Iowa town, where wine could not be had 
for a communion service, opium dens flourished 
for poor wretches whose craving for liquor 
could not be satisfied. Students of ethnology 
know into what insane methods of intoxication 
Mohammedans have been driven by the Koran 
prohibition of wine. Whole districts in Ire- 
land are to-day given over to ether drinking be- 
cause of Father Matthew's phenomenal success 
in his temperance crusade. The whole matter 
lies in a nutshell in this statement : 

" Excessive drinking can only be looked upon as a 
symptom of a debilitated or depraved nature, which, 
without access to drink, would show itself depraved in 
other ways, and which, if artificially kept sober and as- 
sisted thereby to live, will tend to perpetuate itself and 
widen the circle of its depravity." 

The author then studies the criminals and 
incapables, whom at present we seem to prefer 
to help to live and leave descendants. He shows 
in a study of competition how the ranks of the 
unfortunate are constantly recruited. Success 
to-day, in civilization, is not sure to go to the 
best unless by best we mean the "pushing 
and diplomatic," the possessor of " talons and

claws." Still worse, " talent is being bred out 
of us," for the successful career in modern life 
" carries with it and necessitates relative ster- 
ility." Among animals the fit are the ones who 
produce many and healthy young ; among men, 
" the capable and successful are rewarded by 
honor and wealth, but are relatively sterile, and 
the man that society is inclined to overlook con- 
tributes a large percentage to the race of the 
future." 

All of which no doubt sounds to some pes- 
simistic and gloomy. Haycraft has his pan- 
acea. He does not demand relaxation in ef- 
forts to save individuals ; he cannot help us at 
one sweep of the arm to rid ourselves of the 
insane, criminal, and incapable. He would have 
high-minded but diseased persons refrain from 
marriage ; he would have the bad and insane 
prevented from marriage or restricted in the 
production of children ; he would have the 
truly capable careful in selection of life part- 
ners, early in marrying, and conscientious in 
their duty as producers of children. With such 
steps taken, the unfit would soon disappear and 
the race would advance. 

The book will hardly meet an enthusiastic 
reception : it contains far too much of good, 
hard, common-sense. The author is thoroughly 
in earnest. His style is direct, forcible, inter- 
esting. However sound his argument may be, 
it will probably have little direct result. But 
he will set many to thinking, and it is well that 
some one should show us quite fearlessly and 
clearly that Darwinism cannot stop just where 
we might like, and that Natural Selection af- 
fects man in society as much as any species or 

variety of animal.

H.ARNED'8 CYCLOPAEDIA OF HISTORY.* 

When the first two volumes of Mr. Larned's 
"History for Ready Reference and Topical 
Reading " were noticed in THE DIAL [Septem- 
ber 16, 1894], the promise was made that the 
work when completed would add to the refer- 
ence books already in existence a most valuable 
guide to the broad domain of history. We find 
this promise more than fulfilled in the five im- 
perial volumes now before us, aggregating 3935 
pages, completing the work, and, by means of

tion. Springfield, Mass.: The C. A. Nichols Co. 



a Supplement included in the fifth volume, 
bringing it up to within the present year. 

By a rough estimate, four thousand histor- 
ical subjects are fully treated in articles vary- 
ing in length from a single paragraph to four 
hundred pages. Thus are included complete 
histories of all the nations of the earth, past 
and present, as well as of the smaller political 
divisions and important cities. Fully twelve 
thousand titles, chiefly biographical and geo- 
graphical, are introduced as cross references. 
An eclectic method has been employed in the 
preparation of these histories, and the works 
of experts and specialists have been freely 
quoted and duly accredited. To do this, fifteen 
hundred authors have been drawn upon, be- 
sides a large number of historical documents 
and the proceedings of historical societies. 
From the bibliographical tables in the supple- 
ment, it may be seen that over five thousand 
volumes have been made tributary to the work ; 
and in further aid of the student of history, 
references are given to double that number of 
volumes. 

All this attests the amount of labor required 
for the preparation of such a work. That Mr. 
Lamed, who planned this reference library of 
history and has carried it forward to its suc- 
cessful completion, was amply equipped for the 
task, has been evident from the start. His con- 
nection with public libraries has given him an 
exhaustive knowledge of the sources of histor- 
ical information and ready access to the neces- 
sary materials for his work. Close scrutiny of 
the result proves that he has made a most judi- 
cious use of his materials. He has been espe- 
cially liberal in his choice of subjects, and care- 
ful that his work should be as comprehensive 
as possible and that nothing pertaining to the 
field of history should be overlooked. The fol- 
lowing subjects, fully treated, exhibit the wide 
scope he has given to his work: Education, 
Electrical Discovery, Factory Legislation, Debt 
Legislation, Civil Service Reform, Hellenic 
Genius and Influence, Hieroglyphics, Law, 
Libraries, Medical Science, Money and Bank- 
ing, Navigation Laws, Printing and the Press, 
Social Movements, Tariff Legislation, and (in 
the Supplement) Commerce. The editor has 
furthermore furnished transcripts of the con- 
stitutions of the various constitutional coun- 
tries, dynastic genealogies, chronological tables, 
and every other conceivable aid to the success- 
ful pursuit of historical study or reading. 

In the performance of his task, Mr. Larned 
has formed some fortunate alliances. The long

article on the history of Law was prepared by 
Professor Austin Abbott, Dean of the New 
York University Law School. Mr. Alan C. 
Reilly, an expert in historical geography, has 
supplied (besides several outline maps and 
plans) twenty-five ethnographic and historical 
maps, printed in colors, and exhibiting at a 
glance the changes history has made in the 
political divisions of the world at various times. 
In its presentation of universal history in 
convenient encyclopaedic form, this work stands 
alone. The eclectic method pursued is a guar- 
anty of its trustworthiness ; but to make as- 
surance doubly sure in that regard, the editor 
has been careful to introduce the evidence on 
both sides of such historical questions as are 
still undecided, and to give references to recog- 
nized authorities holding views opposed to those 
selected for extended presentation. There re- 
mains to be applied the experimentum crucis, 
the use of these volumes as designed by their 
projector. This we have begun, and thus far 
have found such satisfactory results as to an- 
ticipate a material lightening of the labor here- 
tofore bestowed upon historical research.

It is the only story of any length that the writer has 
thus far sought to tell, and it breaks down com- 
pletely when subjected to the tests we are bound to 
apply to full-fledged works of fiction. There is no 
description worth speaking of ; there is none of that 
power of characterization which gives inevitable- 
ness to the acts of the men and women concerned ; 
there is not very much to be said for the occasional 
pages of psychological analysis, although what praise 
the book deserves must be given to this feature and 
to the general phrase-making therewith associated. 
But the heaviest indictment against the book must 
be based upon the fact that its main interest cen- 
tres about a woman of type so loathsome that it is 
questionable whether it ought even to appear in 
fiction, and quite certain that it should be presented, 
if at all, with some measure of decent reserve. 

We are accustomed to such deep draughts of 
fiction from Mrs. Humphry Ward, to canvases so 
large and filled so f ull with faithful detail, that " The 
Story of Bessie Costrell," being nothing more than 
a novelette, makes a disappointing impression, in 
spite of the fineness of its conception and execu- 
tion. It is a village tragedy, combined with a study 
of the peasant character as it exists in the midland 
districts. The central incident is the theft of an 
old man's hoarded savings as in "Silas Marner," 
which it naturally suggests and the pathos is in 
both cases almost unbearable. The wretched woman 
who steals the money is a carefully studied type, 
but somehow comes just short of being a genuine 
creation. There is no doubt, however, of the fine 
quality of the constructive art displayed in these 
pages, and no living novelist would need to be 
ashamed of having written them. 

" Into the Highways and Hedges " is a title that 
straightway suggests the theme of the book that bears 
it. The story is of an itinerant evangelist of fanati- 
cal type, yet a man of singular simplicity, directness,

and force withal. His mission takes him now to the 
morally benighted rural districts, now to the slums 
of London, and, since the period chosen is the mid- 
dle of the present century, the conditions he meets 
with are greatly different from those of the present 
day. Among those to whom his message makes a 
personal appeal is a young girl of refinement and 
good social position, unhappy in her home surround- 
ings, and impulsive enough to renounce them for 
the sake of sharing, as his wife, the hard existence 
of the preacher. It is an unpromising theme, and 
Miss Montre"sor achieves something of a triumph in 
compelling our sympathetic acceptance of so un- 
natural a relation. The simplicity, the courage, and 
the moral energy of the illiterate preacher end by 
winning the reader's heart as they win the heart of 
the heroine, and these two types, at least, are de- 
lineated with real insight into the workings of char- 
acter. The remaining features of the book are 
rather mechanical, and we get no very vivid reali-

sizing, as it constantly does, the fact that genuine 
worth is largely independent of the accidents of 
birth and breeding.

but for that reason none the less impressive. His 
notion of an "Impregnable City," built upon a 
rocky island in the South Pacific, and made by its 
founder ( an enthusiast of the Count Tolstoy type ) 
a city of refuge for the oppressed of all nations, is 
sufficiently novel to keep the interest alert, and the 
story is told with vivid coloring and dramatic effect. 
The love passages of the story are rather thin and 
unreal, but there is no doubt of the exciting quality 
of the chapters which depict the siege of the City 
and its downfall. 

In " The Martyred Fool," Mr. Christie Murray 
has given us a careful study of an anarchist of the 
practical modern sort, and an account of the con- 
dition and influences which are at work in society, 
and which are adequate here and there to shape a 
character of this, at first, seemingly inexplicable 
type. The first part of the book shows us our an- 
archist in embryo, a child in the Australian bush, 
living in extreme poverty, learning from his parents 
only one thing that the rich are always and every- 
where the oppressors of the poor, taking the lesson 
deep into his passionate heart, a child to whom the 
trial and execution of his father for murder appeal- 
only in the light of a triumphant substantiation of 
the truth of that lesson ; here is enough to account 
for the anarchistic predisposition, at least. In the 
second part, the boy, befriended and provided with 
an education, has grown to be a man, but his asso- 
ciations have been such as to confirm the prejudiced 
and bitter view of the social structure impressed 
upon him as a child, and a small group of desper- 



ate conspirators, making Paris their headquarters, 
find in him a ready tool. At the last moment, how- 
ever, realizing the essential baseness of the work 
that he has rashly undertaken to perform, and at 
the same time furious at the discovery that his as- 
sociates have tricked him, he turns the bomb with 
which the crime was to have been committed into 
an instrument of destruction for himself and for 
the more hardened criminals who have urged him 
on. The whole story is told with directness and 
dramatic effect, and the hero, little deserving of 
sympathy as he is, gets enough of it to remain 
throughout an object of interest. Abhorrence for 
the ideas and practices of the anarchist are not alto- 
gether incompatible with a certain degree of respect 
for his courage and his devotion to what he believes 
to be the cause of justice. This seems to us to be 
one of the best of Mr. Murray's many books, and 
at the same time one of the best of the recent novels 
of " underground Europe." It is far from reach- 
ing the level of Mr. Black's " Sunrise," for exam- 
ple, but it is also well above the level of the merely 
sensational stories of similar theme that have be- 
come so abundant of late. 

"The Prince of Balkistan " is not so distinctly 
raised above that level, and in some of its scenes 
becomes the merest melodrama. But a slight meas- 
ure of redemption may be claimed for it on behalf 
of its variety of ingenious incident, and the fresh- 
ness of some of its material. Balkistan is one of 
the Balkan States, and its Prince is a German placed 
upon the throne in accordance with the will of the 
people whom he governs, but in defiance of the 
wishes of Russia. The reference to recent happen- 
ings in Southeastern Europe is so obvious through- 
out that there is no real disguise in any of the proper 
names devised by the author. The story is essen- 
tially one of intrigue and adventure, well-planned 
and exciting. 

It is difficult to justify the existence of a book 
that makes its readers think meanly of mankind, 
although it possess all the virtues of finished style, 
symmetrical construction, and vital characterization. 
Since Mr. Gissing's newest fiction, " In the Year 
of Jubilee," makes not the slightest approach to any 
of these forms of excellence, and since its chief 
characters are without exception sordid and vulgar 
examples of humanity, the most complaisant of 
critics would find some difficulty in finding anything 
to praise. Mr. Gissing's portrayals of low and mid- 
dle-class life in England are, with their dull real- 
ism, about as uninviting as anything that we have 
lately been called upon to contemplate, and the 
present example seems to be the worst of them all. 

The story of " Almayer's Folly " takes us to so 
remote a place as Borneo, and tells the sombre 
tragedy of a Dutch trader, seeking a fortune that 
ever eludes him, and living unhappily with a Malay 
wife. Almost as much interest attaches to his 
daughter, in whose nature the strain of Malay sav- 
agery struggles with the European, and finally as- 



1895.]

serts its mastery. Deserting her parents for the 
caresses of a native lover, she crushes the last hope 
remaining to her father, and leaves him to the min- 
istries of gin and opium that soon put an end to his 
miserable life. The Malay and Arab characters 
that figure in the narrative seem to be portrayed 
with fidelity to their respective racial types, and, 
by their contrast with the European, enforces once 
more the lesson that " East is East, and West is 
West, and never the twain shall meet." 

It might be a little rash to say that the place of 
Louis Stevenson, as a biographer of the beach-com- 
ber and a chronicler of life in the isles of the South- 
ern Seas, had been already filled, but it is certain 
that it has a not unwoi'thy occupant in Mr. Guy 
Boothby, two novels by whom are before us. While 
these books have not the felicity of style character- 
istic of " The Ebb-Tide," and while they make oc- 
casional concessions to the lower instincts of novel- 
readers such, for example, as letting us know that 
the heroes in both cases are English noblemen in 
disguise that Stevenson, with his healthy demo- 
cratic instincts, would never have made, yet they 
curiously reproduce in many ways the schooling of 
their unacknowledged but unquestionable exemplar. 
Of the two, " A Lost Endeavor " is the slighter per- 
formance, but perhaps the more artistic in the work- 
ing out. In " The Marriage of Esther," there are 
more loose ends, so to speak, more trains of sugges- 
tion started by the novelist and left for the reader 
to do what he can with. But both books are dis- 
tinctly clever performances, and their author is a 
man whom we are likely to have to reckon with dur- 
ing the next few years. 

Neither "The Zeit-Geist" nor "The Mermaid" 
will add anything to the reputation gained for Miss 
Dougall by her two earlier novels. The former is 
hardly a story at all, but rather a theological dis- 
quisition of mystical flavor ; the other is so clumsy 
in its machinery that it keeps a reader continually 
out of patience. Both books are characterized by 
preoccupation with religious matters, and the writer 
seems to be struggling, not so much for suitable 
expression as for a distinct realization in her own 
mind of certain fundamental religious problems. 
This imperfect mastery of her material, coupled 
with much amateurishness and unnatural solemnity, 
prevents Miss Bengali's work from making a deep 
impression. It is too strenuous to be forcible, too 
monotonous to be attractive. Its main interest is 
to be found in its glimpses of everyday life in the 
Provinces of Lower Canada. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker has allowed a fantastic im- 
agination to run riot in his tale of the year "When 
Valmond Came to Pontiac." Yet utterly prepos- 
terous as is the conception of the story, it is told 
with such grace of diction and intensity of feeling 
that we are constrained for the moment to accept 
the hero and his claims, to sympathize with him in 
his devotion to his cause. For Valmond, coming to 
the little Canadian village of Pontiac one summer 



in the late forties, with well-lined purse and the 
most winning of ways, passes himself off upon the 
simple village folk as a natural son of the great 
Napoleon, and with their aid sets about the realiza- 
tion of a mad plan for the raising of an army, and 
the expulsion of Louis Philippe from the Tuileries. 
Valmond is represented as the embodiment of an 
almost fanatical enthusiasm for the Napoleonic idea, 
and as carrying self-delusion almost to the point of 
believing in his own claims. His influence upon 
the Pontiac folk, and the contagion of his enthusi- 
asm, are finely-planned effects in pure romance, and 
Mr. Parker is to be congratulated upon having 
achieved a success almost commensurate with the 
daring of his invention. We do not know that much 
is gained by telling us, in an epilogue, that Val- 
mond really was, unknown to himself, what he had 
pretended, and almost believed himself to be. Yet 
the irony of the revelation, coming after his tragic 
end, is not without being impressive, and the study 
of Valmond's character has evidently been made 
with this explanation in ultimate view. 

Mrs. Burton Harrison's latest novel is in a new 
vein, for she has chosen, after the fashion of Mr. 
William Black, to associate with the interest of a 
love-story the interest of travel in some of the most 
romantic parts of Europe, and thus to provide a pic- 
turesque and varied background for the " Errant 
Wooing " of her heroes and heroines. Of these there 
are four, and their story is one of " elective affini- 
ties," declared early enough to preserve the con- 
ventionalities and avoid post-matrimonial complica- 
tions. It is pleasant to accompany these well-bred 
people in their wanderings through England, Spain, 
and Morocco, and to share in their hopes and fears, 
their ambitions and achievements. The novel is 
of the " international " genus, and brings into con- 
trast, with no little spicy suggestion, the character- 
istics of its English and American characters. 

The mark of the amateur is upon almost every 
page of Miss Bigelow's " Diplomatic Disenchant- 
ments," yet it seems less of a defect than it usually 
is, and gives the impression that the writer will soon 
and easily learn to avoid it. In spite thereof, and 
equally in spite of a certain carelessness of diction 
and of slips in the use of foreign words and proper 
names, there is a charm about this unpretentious 
story the charm of freshness and spontaneity, the 
charm that comes from an observant eye and a vivid 
sense of the minor humors of life. Then the ex- 
periences of an American scholar, suddenly trans- 
planted, rather against his inclination, from the pre- 
cincts of a New England college to the United States 
Legation at a European capital, is by no means bad 
stuff for a novel, especially when the writer is qual- 
ified by residence in the capital concerned to write 
entertainingly and truthfully about it. But we ob- 
ject to her having come so dangerously near to mak- 
ing her minister out to be a simpleton ; it was her 
desire to score a few humorous points, rather than 
her better judgment, that caused him to be thus 



94 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



pictured as the embodiment of guilelessness. Some 
of our national representatives in the diplomatic ser- 
vice abroad do queer things, Heaven knows, but not 
those belonging to the social stratum in which Miss 
Bigelow has chosen to find her example of the class. 

Mr. Bliss Perry is one of the most promising of 
the younger Americans who have taken to story- 
telling, and one takes up with pleasurable anticipa- 
tions his latest and most ambitious book. " The 
Plated City " is not so very ambitious, either, for 
it deals only with a little group of people in a Con- 
necticut manufacturing town, and its plot has but 
a moderate degree of complication. The most no- 
ticeable thing about the book is the careful finish of 
the workmanship ; there is nothing scamped, even 
in the lesser details. This quality is a source of 
distinct and unfailing pleasure in itself, and when 
we add that it is conjoined with good style and ex- 
cellent taste, an interesting story and shrewd sym- 
pathetic character-drawing, we need hardly make in 
so many words the inference that Mr. Perry has 
done a very satisfactory piece of work. 

One of the most healthful symptoms of our recent 
literature has been the multiplication of novels based 
upon the history of our colonial period. Mr. Bynner 
and Mrs. Austin gave us much admirable writing of 
this sort, and many others of our late writers have re- 
verted to the scenes and incidents of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. Miss Maud Wilder Good- 
win, already accredited to literature by her finished 
study of " The Colonial Cavalier," now joins the ranks 
of our colonial novelists with " The Head of a Hun- 
dred," a story of Virginia in the early seventeenth 
century. It is an exceptionally graceful piece of 
work, a love-story told with feeling and insight, im- 
bued with the spirit of its period, and made quaint 
by effective touches of archaism. The career of 
the hero is unfolded, in well-ordered sequence, from 
the time when he seeks the New World to forget 
the maiden whom he fancies is lost to him, through 
various exciting episodes of frontier adventure and 
Indian warfare, to the final reunion with the wo- 
man who has loved him all the time, he being too 
modest or dull-witted to realize it. The book is a 
very charming one, simple, tasteful, and bathed in 
the atmosphere of romance. 

Dr. Underwood's posthumous novel comes to us 
as something of a surprise, for we had supposed 
that the author early in life abandoned fiction as a 
medium of self-expression. " Quabbin," to be sure, 
had the semblance of a novel, but the semblance 
only, for it was evident enough that the real pur- 
pose of that remarkable book was the presentation 
of a social study. " Dr. Gray's Quest," too, has 
something of this character, and will perhaps be 
more highly valued for its intimate view of New 
England town life early in the century than for its 
qualities as mere narrative. In some of its aspects 
it is even too intimate to get much sympathy from 
readers not of the very puritan stock with which it 
deals, while those who are of that stock will prob- 



ably exaggerate the merits of the book, and give to 
constructive art the credit for what is, after all, 
nothing more than keen observation and close com- 
prehension of a bygone phase of American life, 
clothed in the mellow wisdom of philosophic age. 
For the present writer, it is no easy task to charac- 
terize this book, so strong is its personal appeal, yet 
we are compelled to recognize the fact that it has 
many faults, that some of its incidents are highly 
improbable and some of its characters very imper- 
fectly vitalized ; that the action is stiff throughout, 
and the method old-fashioned in the bad sense as 
well as the good. On the other hand, the general 
plan is well-conceived and even striking, while two 
or three at least of the leading figures are strongly 
individualized. 

Of the many volumes of short stories brought 
forth by the past few months, few seem deserving 
of special mention. We have chosen half a dozen 
of them, English and American, that seem to call 
for consideration in this article. Sir Walter Besant 
shall head the list with " In Deacon's Orders and 
Other Stories." There are eleven pieces in this 
collection, that which gives it a title being the most 
important. The author calls it a study in " relig- 
iosity," a word which is hardly adequate to express 
the consummate rascality and hypocrisy combined 
of its principal character. The remaining stories 
are slight productions, and two or three have a dis- 
tinct flavor of allegory. They are marked by ease 
and fluency, much fertility of invention, and whole- 
someness of tone. 

Mr. George Moore's three studies of "Celibates" 
are as distinctly unwholesome as Sir Walter's tales 
are wholesome. They have a certain finish of style, 
and attempt a subtlety of analysis that we should 
hardly expect of Sir Walter, but the sane outlook 
of the latter is a far more desirable equipment than 
Mr. Moore's jaundiced vision. Indeed, it takes as 
ugly a word as bestial to characterize the imagina- 
tion revealed in the worst scenes of this book. There 
is nothing edifying, or even attractive, about the 
sickly types of manhood and womanhood that fill 
Mr. Moore's gallery ; they are " degenerates " of a 
peculiarly disagreeable sort. The author's impres- 
sionist method, moreover, is as unsatisfactory in an 
artistic sense, as, from a moral point of view, is his 
choice of subjects. 

To turn from Mr. Moore's pages to those of Mr. 
Kenneth Grahame, in " The Golden Age," is like 
passing from the miasmatic exhalations of a swamp 
to the fragrant air of some daisy-starred adjoining 
meadow. Mr. Grahame's " golden age " is the one 
in which we have all lived for a brief space, the age 
when the world was full of wond^er, and the imag- 
ination doubted not of its own creations. But few 
of us, when we have outlived it, are able to erect 
once more in thought the structure of that age, its 
form and pressure ; the once firm outlines are irre- 
vocably lost, and the passion of our regret clings to 
images that are but shifting, and to memories 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

whereof we may not understand why they remain 
so dear. Mr. Grahame is one of the few fortunate 
to whom, in manhood, the child's point of view re- 
mains yet accessible, and these little stories or 
sketches, that so irresistibly command alternate 
smiles and tears, are unmatched by anything that we 
know of, unless it be Stevenson's volume of child- 
hood verse. No descriptive words can do justice to 
the exquisite art of this lovely book to the charm 
of its style, the gentleness of its irony, the lambency 
of its humor, or the deep tenderness of its feeling. 
Such sketches as " A Harvesting," " The Argo- 
nauts," and " The Roman Road " are classics in 
miniature, to be read and reread with ever deepen- 
ing delight. 

There are but two stories in Mr. George Bas- 
sett's "Hippolyte and Golden Beak," and the com- 
ponent parts of this title are their respective names. 
The author, though he writes from the wilds of Wis- 
consin, appears to be an Englishman. Both stories 
are well told, and provided with startling denoue- 
ments. Hippolyte is a precocious French boy who 
serves as a gentleman's valet, and ends his career 
with the explosion of a dynamite bomb, snatched 
and run away with in time to save the lives which 
it threatened ; Golden Beak, alias Mrs. Potwin, 
is an American divorcee, loved by a descendant of 
the Tokugawa shoguns, and by him murdered, in 
strange Oriental fashion, when he deems her faith- 
less. 

Mr. Henry Harland is, we trust, still an Amer- 
ican, although we have lost his presence, and although 
Yellow Books and Parisian haunts now claim his 
attention. The " Gray Roses " of his new volume 
are nine in number. They are tales and sketches 
tinged with the pathos of retrospect, and prefaced 
by this " keynote " motto: " Yes, the conception was 
a rose, but the achievement is a rose grown gray." 
Several of them are stories of Pays Latin, and 
most of them are infused with the sentiment of the 
Quarter. " The Bohemian Girl " and " Castles near 
Spain," first and last in the collection, are probably 
the most successful of these pieces. 

It is a relief to pass from these sketches of a 
sophisticated civilization to Miss Murfree's pictures 
of nature and primitive man in the Tennessee 
mountains. Miss Murfree has turned to the short 
story once more, and five such stories, finely imag- 
inative, fill the volume before us. The scenes are 
-by this time familiar enough to her readers, but the 
Rembrandt-like quality of her art has the old fascin- 
ation, and its essential truthfulness makes it accept- 
able in spite of its repetitions. Perhaps the grave 
and studied rhetoric of the descriptive passages is 
not altogether in keeping with the simple conditions 
of life that are portrayed, or with the rugged emo- 
tional nature of these untutored mountain-folk, but 
the sum total of the effect is certainly impressive, 
and reveals one of the most masterly hands now at 
s work in American literature. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



A volume 
of English 
fishing lore. 



BRIEFS O:NJNE\V BOOKS. 

Holiday-makers of a piscatorial turn 
will find Mr. John Bickerdyke's 
" Days of My Life " ( Longmans) a 
rare book to beguile the evening after a hard day's 
fishing. Indeed, we should be puzzled to name on 
short notice another one of the class quite so good. 
The author, we need scarcely say, is a noted English 
Brother of the Angle, and his stories are all first-hand 
and capitally told. They range themselves under 
the two main headings : " Fresh Water " and " Salt 
Water," with such pleasantly suggestive minor titles 
as "Three Thames Trout," "In the Murgthal," 
"A Glacier Salmon River," "On a May Day," 
"Trout Problems," "The Bass of the Maelstrom," 
etc. Several of the papers are of a humorous turn, 
among them one with the curious title " Fin-de- 
Siecle Fish." Fin-de-siecle fish, as we gather from 
Mr. Bickerdyke, are of no special scientific variety. 
An outcome of civilization, and found always near 
great centres of population, their chief character- 
istic is extreme distrust of man, and consequent in- 
difference to the usual blandishments in the way of 
bait. If caught at all, it is only by uncouth and 
unorthodox methods as in the case of Mr. Bicker- 
dyke's famous fin-de-siecle trout. This sagacious 
fish " had his headquarters opposite a clubhouse on 
a certain famous stream." Flies innumerable had 
floated captivatingly, yet harmlessly, above his ven- 
erable head ; and there was a story that once, in an 
unguarded moment, getting hooked on a piece of 
bread, he had quickly " warped " the line round a 
convenient stump, extracted the hook, and was pla- 
cidly rising to some natural flies half an hour after- 
wards. New club-members used to bet they would 
catch him, and old ones would take their bets and 
pocket their money, as a matter of course. One day 
there joined the club a comparative novice who, 
with a novice's conceit, promptly proposed to catch 
the fin-de-siecle trout. Old members laughed, took 
his bets as usual, and languidly awaited the result. 
Next evening the new member arrived provided 
with many bluebottle flies and (Shade of Walton !) 
a peashooter. He at once began, so to speak, to lay 
his parallels. Says our author: "Deftly a half- 
dead bluebottle was puffed out of the tube in front 
of the fish. It was taken, of course, as everything 
eatable from a trout's point of view was taken. The 
fish had a rare supper that evening. . . . He fed 
the trout in this way for more than a week ; the 
others smiled and looked on. ' I will catch him 
soon,' said the new member, ' I am only waiting for 
wind.' In three weeks there came a day when a 
stiff breeze was blowing up-stream. The new mem- 
ber appeared at the clubhouse with a long, slender 
rod, with running tackle and a length of fine but 
strong gut, terminating with a single hook. He took 
his stand some distance below the fish and began 
feeding him as usual. On the hook was a bluebottle. 
Good luck helped our friend, who, however, exhibited 
some skill. The up-stream breeze took the hooked

[Aug. 16, 



fly just over the trout, and the new member at the 
same time puffed a fly out of the tube. Which would 
the trout take ? Had the rod been in front instead 
of behind him he would have taken neither. But 
he did not see the rod, having no eyes in his tail 
(this has been questioned), and the fly containing 
the hook was sucked in. How he fought ! He died, 
as wise and grand a specimen of a fin-de-siecle fish 
as has ever been seen in a trout stream." A good 
deal of English fishing lore may be extracted from 
Mr. Bickerdyke's book. 



Etsa s b Square and Circle " (Macmil- 

a ""punch" Ian), by "Jack Easel, sometime 

contributor. Punch's Roving Correspondent," is 

not a treatise on geometry or carpentry, as one may 
hastily infer from the title. " Mr. Easel's " Square 
is only Dexter Square, Bayswater ; and his Circle 
is merely that of his acquantances and household. 
The reader will perhaps " shy " at first at the omi- 
nous fact (strangely paraded on the title-page) of the 
author's " sometime " connection with " Punch "- 
a journal of rather atrabiliary suggestions to the 
American mind. We hasten to say, however, that 
" Mr. Easel's " humor is as remote in quality from 
the depressing article that forms the staple of that 
respectable London weekly as it is from the cheap 
buffoonery of the miscalled " humorous columns " 
of our own daily papers. " Mr. Easel " is a de- 
lightfully amusing and withal refined writer, with a 
playful, gently-satiric vein, at times almost Thack- 
erayan in quality. His book comprises a series of 
brief causeries on his drawing-room, his sanctum, 
his books, pets, servants, amusements, etc., spiced 
with any number of piquant " asides " on all sorts 
of topics. Evidences of sound taste and sound read- 
ing are abundant ; and if " Mr. Easel's " standards 
and preferences in art and letters are not exactly of 
the ultra " up-to-date " order, our readers are not 
likely to think the less of him for that. As to paint- 
ing, for instance, he complains, with much reason : 
" Old canons of style and grace are forgotten 
old standards of excellence are set aside. The one 
essential condition of success for a fin-de-siecle pic- 
ture is that it shall be original. Group your figures 
in constrained attitudes enshroud them with fog 
or deck them in all the colors of the rainbow : paint 
your skies red and your meadows blue : show us a 
sea without ships, knights without courage, youth 
without joy, love-making without beauty, drapery 
without texture ' impressions ' good, bad, or indif- 
ferent no matter so long as they are original! " 
Had " Mr. Easel," in this passage, written " eccen- 
tric " in place of "original " he would seem to have 
hit the case fairly well. We suspect that " impres- 
sionism " (a much-abused term) is made to cover a 
multitude of sins in the direction of personal inca- 
pacity and lack of technical skill ; and certainly the 
ways of Providence are not more inscrutable than 
is the current vogue of those amazing productions in 
purple, orange, pink, pea-green, and vermillion, that 
one is nowadays asked to accept (on trust) as quite 



peculiarly truthful representations of nature. Luck- 
ily, however, every fad has its day ; so we may 
cheerfully expect pseudo- impressionism to go the 
way of good Bishop Berkeley's tar-water and Gen- 
eral Pleasan ton's blue-glass ere long. 

* ew selections " The Golden Book of Coleridge " 
from Coleridge is the happy title chosen by the Rev. 
and Shelley. Stopf ord A. Brooke to adorn his vol- 

ume of selections from Coleridge's verse. A golden 
book it must be that contains "Christabel" and 
" Kubla Khan," in spite of whatever alloy of the 
less finished work the editor has thought it wise to 
include. A feature of the book that must not be over- 
looked is the remarkable introductory essay, which 
makes us more impatient than ever for the comple- 
tion of the author's long-planned and partly executed 
history of English poetry. The essay is upwards 
of sixty pages in length, and at least equals the best 
critical treatment to which the poetry of Coleridge 
has yet been subject. We cannot refrain from quot- 
ing a part of what is said of the poet's opium-eating : 
" More than enough has been said about it from the 
moral point of view. The mass of right and gentle- 
thinking folk are thoroughly sick of the Pharisaic 
habit in which so many writers indulge, of making 
the great poets as well as other men of genius the 
moral object-lessons of mankind, or of using their 
errors, especially in matters relating to women, as 
the ground for endless discussions in biographies, 
reviews, sermons, and the daily press. These dis- 
cussions minister to the ugliest of all the cravings 
of Society. . . . The long discussion about Shelley 
and his wife and Mary Godwin is intolerable, and 
as uninteresting, except to those whose nectar is 
scandal and whose ambrosia is gossip. And how 
wicked it has been ! It has turned men's eyes away 
from the permanent and noble in him to the tran- 
sient and the commonplace. The reverence due to 
his work has been lowered, and this is an injury to 
mankind. Even Matthew Arnold was carried away 
into a ludicrous attempt to make Shelley vulgar. 
He might as well have tried to vulgarize the star 
Arcturus." These are words that have long needed 
to be said, and we are glad that Mr. Brooke has 
spoken them with so much emphasis. We may 
fitly couple with this volume of Coleridge the sim- 
ilar volume, edited by Mr. Ernest Rhys, of " The 
Lyric Poems of Shelley." The editor's introduc- 
tion is brief but just in its appreciation. Both of 
these books have the Dent imprint, and are supplied 
in this country by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

Mr. William H. Rideing's " In the 
L and of Lorna Doone" (Crowell) 
is a pretty, inexpensive book, com- 
prising five brief descriptive papers of a rural and 
" summery " flavor, which readers with a taste for 
literary quality will do well to add to their sum-

" A Bit of the Yorkshire Coast," and " Amy Robsart, 
Kenil worth, and Warwick." Mr. Rideing's grace- 
ful and graphic pen seems to bring one very near 
the rustic England of Abbey and Hugh Thomson 
the England, as he says, " of ' The Quiet Life,' of 
fat meadows, flowing verdure, tiled and thatched 
cottages, mossy, dripping mill-wheels, hawthorn 
hedges, inviting inns, and spacious parks, where the 
beeches and oaks throw out rounded, drooping vol- 
umes of foliage, that have the soft density of an 
exhalation, and where the cuckoo, lark, and night- 
ingale are fearless visitors." The reader who is 
familiar with the polished, park-like beauties of old 
England will feel the truth of Mr. Rideing's de- 
scription. It accentuates, too, it may be added, pre- 
cisely that note of English landscape which, charm 
as it may at first, soon palls upon the transatlantic 
visitor, and awakens a longing for the wilder and 
less prim and regular beauties of American field 
and woodland. Very different, however, from En- 
glish landscape in general is that of the land of 
" Lorna Doone " mostly moorland, wild, unculti- 
vated, and solitary, clothed with only gorse, heather, 
and bracken, or clumps of scrub oaks and dwarf 
pines, still the haunt and cover of the wild deer. 
Nearly everyone who visits this country nowadays 
brings, as a matter of course, Mr. Blackmore's ro- 
mance with him. " The visitors," says our author, 
" go forth in the morning, book in hand, and make 
it the gospel for the day " which ought to be glory 
enough for Mr. Blackmore. Mr. Rideing has sea- 
soned his pages with some quaint specimens of rustic 
dialect. Here is one from Cornwall : "While we were 
at Penzance a high-pressure sermon was delivered 
against modern unbelief ; and a fisherman who was 
asked what he thought of the preacher answered, 
' Aw ! a stunner a was. He es the boy fer the in- 
ferels. Iss aw iss ; and a sent the sances (sciences) 
to shivereens too. Es no good fer ould Bardar- 
laugh or Darby (Darwin) to coom where a is.' " 
We infer that those ancient temporal and spiritual 
lords, the " squire " and the " parson," are still 
strong in Cornwall. 



spiritual life 
in modern 

English poetry. 



^ e Spirit in the Mod- 
ern English Poets " (Houghton), by 

Migg y ida j) S cu( Jder, is a work 

difficult of characterization in a few words. At- 
tempting, although on a smaller scale and within 
the limits of a single nationality, what Dr. Brandes 
has attempted in his " Hovedstromninger," Miss 
Scudder has sought to isolate for special study such 
aspects of modern thought as have attracted to them- 
selves the greater part of English poetic energy 
such things, for example, as the revolutionary im- 
pulse, the new scientific spirit, the sympathetic envis- 
agement of the historical past, and the aspirations 
of a deanthropomorphized religion. " Let us study," 
she says, " the influence of science in all our poets ; 
the new democracy, especially in Wordsworth ; the 
early religious and social ideals, especially in Shelley ; 
the power of the past in the poetry of reversion ; 



the power of the present in the ironic art of Brown- 
ing ; the poetry of religious inquiry in its various 
phases ; and, finally, the outlook of faith." This is 
a praiseworthy programme, even if we may not ac- 
cept the conclusion, u that the poetry of our age has 
a vital unity, and witnesses to an advance of the 
spirit, straight as the logic of experience, from doubt 
to faith and cheer." Anyone who starts out upon 
a critical excursion with such a thesis as this to 
maintain will be apt unconsciously to make the 
facts fit therewith ; and, however plausibly they are 
arrayed by Miss Scudder in support of her conten- 
tion, we feel at many points that something might 
be said upon the other side. Her appreciation of 
the spiritual elements in Victorian poetry is usually 
keen and adequate, although she now and then dis- 
plays a curious blindness, as, for example, toward the 
social and ethical phases of Mr. Swinburne's work. 
To speak of him as " acknowledging no sphere but 
that of the senses and the passions " is the most gro- 
tesque of perversions. We are surprised, also, to find 
no account made of Mrs. Browning and Christina 
Rossetti, in which work the " life of the spirit " is 
surely, if anywhere, to be found. But in spite of 
some defects, Miss Scudder's book is a noteworthy 
contribution to poetical criticism, and deserves the 
careful attention of students. 



The new 
English edition 
*f Balzac. 



" ^ a P eau de Chagrin," translated 
by Miss Ellen Marriage as " The 
wild Ass's Skin," inaugurates the 
new Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac in English 
which Mr. George Saintsbury has been engaged to 
edit and superintend generally. The edition will, 
we understand, be a practically complete version of 
the novels, extending to something like forty vol- 
umes. Each novel will have a special introduction 
by the editor, these introductions forming, with the 
prefatory essay now published, "a sufficient study 
of Balzac and a sufficient commentary on his work." 
We have no doubt that Mr. Saintsbury will fulfil rea- 
sonably the boast implied in the above words, and 
shall await with pleasure his remarks upon the suc- 
cessive volumes. The first volume is well printed, 
tastefully bound, and provided with three etchings. 
If it may be assumed to set the standard for the 
series, the completion of the undertaking will pro- 
vide English readers with a Balzac far more attract- 
ive mechanically than anything existing in French.

the history of progress in these and other directions 
in this truly interesting and suggestive book. The 
style, though vague at times, is usually pleasing. 
The descriptions of devices are not always clear. 
The illustrations are mainly from specimens in the 
United States National Museum, with which the 
author is officially connected. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In the " Library of Philosophy," edited by Mr. J. H. 
Muirhead (Macmillan) there has recently been pub- 
lished a translation, by Miss Helen Dendy, of the 
" Logic " of Dr. Christoph Sigwart, of Tubingen. The 
translation is not only authorized, but has been carefully 
revised by the author. It fills nearly a thousand large 
pages, divided into two volumes. In comparison with 
this bulky treatise, Dr. Noah K. Davis's " Elements of 
Inductive Logic " (Harper) is as a pygmy to a giant, 
being designed for use as an elementary college text- 
book. It is a systematic and carefully-written manual. 

Two translations of Count Tolstoy's " Master and 
Man " have reached us. One is translated by Mr. A. 
Hulme Beaman (Appleton),and has an introduction by 
Mr. W. D. Howells; the other is the joint production of 
Miss Yekaterina Alexandrovna Ludwig and Dr. George 
Bruce Halsted, and is published by " The Neomon," in 
Austin, Texas. The latter version appears to be the 
more careful and exact. As for the story, it teaches, 
in the author's familiar didactic style, the lesson of the 
common humanity that is shared by the lowest and the 
highest in the social scale, and exalts the beauty of sac- 
rifice in a singularly touching manner. 

Mr. Richard B. Gruelle is the author of a volume of 
" Notes, Critical and Biographical," upon the famous 
art collection of Mr. W. T. Walters, of Baltimore. 
Aside from the artistic feeling and critical insight dis- 
played in no small measure by this work, it appeals to 
the book-collector by the great beauty of its mechanical 
execution. The volume is one of over two hundred 
pages, and is printed in black and red, upon Michallet 
paper. It is published by Mr. J. M. Bowles, the editor 
of " Modern Art," in a limited edition, and copies may 
be had at the absurdly low price of seventy-five cents. 
We predict that the edition will not last long. The ad- 
dress of Mr. Bowles is 286 Roxbury street, Boston. 

"Dentscher Wortschatz; oder, Der Passende Aus- 
druck," is the title of a sort of German thesaurus pre- 
pared by Herr A. Schlessing, and obtainable in this 
country from Messrs. B. Westermann & Co. Its lists 
of synonyms and groupings of allied words and expres- 
sions make it a very valuable aid for those who have 
occasion to express themselves in German, or to trans- 
late into that language. The work was first published 
three years ago, and the present is a second and revised 
edition. 

Dr. Morton W. Eastman's " Readings in Gower " is 
a recent publication of the University of Pennsylvania, 
obtainable through Messrs. Ginn & Co. Dr. Eastman 
has been going through the Gower manuscripts in the 
British Museum, and has made a large number of cor- 
rections in the current printed texts. Every owner of 
Pauli will need this little volume as a supplement, and 
will be likely to share the author's conviction that a 
new edition of the " Confessio Amantis "is sorely needed. 



LiITERARY NOTES. 



"The American Historical Review," already an- 
nounced in these pages, will make its first appearance 
in October. 

Eighty-three titles are included in a list of the books 
written or edited by the Rev. Edward Everett Hale. 
May he live to complete his century! 

Professor James Taft Hatfield reprints from the 
" Methodist Review," in pamphlet form, a sympathetic 
critical study of " The Poetry of Wilhelm Mtiller." 

" The Mid-Continent," until recently " The Southern 
Magazine," has discontinued publication, having sold 
its subscription list and good will to the publishers of 
"Scribner's Magazine," who will fill out all unexpired 
subscriptions. 

Mr. J. M. Bowles has moved his beautiful quarterly, 
" Modern Art," from Indianapolis to Boston, and now 
inaugurates his third volume with a number dated Jan- 
uary 1, 1895. Two more numbers will follow in quick 
succession, enabling the periodical to " catch up." A 
new typographical dress makes it more attractive than 
ever. 

A new series of manuals of the history of literature, 
projected by Mr. Gosse, is promised for the near future. 
English literature will be taken by the editor, French 
by Professor Dowden, Italian by Dr. Garnett, Greek by 
Professor G. G. A. Murray, Japanese by Mr. Basil Hall 
Chamberlain, and Modern Scandinavian by Dr. Georg 
Brandes. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have purchased the library 
of Mr. Norton Q. Pope, of Brooklyn, and will place it 
on private sale. There are less than ten thousand vol- 
umes in the collection, but the average value is very 
high. The most famous number is the Caxton " Morte 
Darthur," the only perfect copy in existence. It is re- 
ported that the price paid for the library was $150,000. 

The latest addition to the lengthening list of publica- 
tions issuing from the University of Chicago Press is 
the first number of " The American Journal of Soci- 
ology," a bi-monthly review. The Faculty of Social 
Science, with Professor Albion W. Small at the head, 
constitutes the editorial board. The new review pre- 
sents a dignified appearance and an attractive pro- 
gramme. We congratulate the editors both upon their 
first number and upon their pioneer occupation of an 
important field. 

Mr. Frederick Saunders, librarian of the Astor Li- 
brary, celebrated his eighty-eighth birthday on the thir- 
teenth of August. He is well preserved and active. 
Mr. Saunders was born in London, his father having 
been the senior member of the firm of Saunders & Ot- 
ley, book publishers. He was well educated, and at the 
age of thirty he was sent to this country to endeavor to 
influence such action by Congress as would prevent 
American piracy of English books. His attempts to 
this end were not successful, although petitions for an 
international copyright were headed by such men as 
Irving, Bancroft, and Bryant. Mr. Saunders deter- 
mined to remain in this country, and was engaged in 
various positions before becoming connected with the 
Astor Library. In 1859 he was appointed assistant 
librarian of the Astor Library, and in 1876 librarian, 
where he has continued ever since. Mr. Saunders is 
well known to book readers, particularly of the older 
generation, as the author of " Salad for the Solitary " 
and other once-popular volumes of light essays.

" The story is told in a delightfully simple and spontaneous manner. 
Mr. Trevor-Battye's simple and unaffected narrative enables us to 
learn a good deal. " London Times. 

" From beginning to end the story of this adventure is outside the 
common lines. It is a tale of success of an odd kind." Spectator.

ter." Glasgow Herald.

pleasant volume, ' The Alps from End to End.' " Times,

" Mrs. Ward's new story is one of the daintiest little gems I have come across in my weekly literature hunts." ALAN 
DALE, in the New York World. 

"Mrs. Ward has done nothing finer than this brief story. The sustained interest, which does not permit the reader to 
miss a line ; the vivid clearness in which each character stands out in self-revelation ; the unfailing insight into the familiar 
and confused workings of the village mind all represent work of the highest class. ' The Story of Bessie Costrell ' will 
become an English classic." Christian World.

FICTION WORTH READING. 



THE NEW MOON. 

By C. E. RAIMOND, author of " George Mandeville's Hus- 
band," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

" An intensely interesting story. A curious inter-weaving of old su- 
perstitions which govern a nervous woman's selfish life, and the brisk, 
modern ways of a wholesome English girl." Philadelphia Ledger. 

" The story is admirably written. The author has a forcible style and 
a remarkable power of developing ideas with i strong presentation of 
the details. ' The New Moon ' is one of the most impressive of recent 
works of fiction, both for its matter and especially for its presentation." 
Milwaukee Journal. 

THE LILAC SUNBONNET. 

A Love Story. By S. R. CROCKETT, author of " The Stick! 1 
Minister," "The Raiders," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" A charming love story, redolent of the banks and braes and lochs 
and pines, healthy to the core, the love that God made for man and wo- 
man's first glimpse of paradise, and a constant reminder of it." San 
Francisco Call. 

"The cleverest of the clever fictions of a clever writer." Elmira 
Telegram. 

" Mr. Crockett has written no better story than this." Boston Sat- 
urday Evening Gazette. 

THE ZEIT-GEIST. 

By L. DOUGALL, author of " The Mermaid," " Beggars All," 

etc. 16mo, cloth. 75 cents. 

" This story is for their reading who reflect and aspire, who find God 
immanent in all things even in the sin and shame that drag humanity 
downward and leave it there, as well as in the virtue and glory that lift 
it higher, and who believe, on the testimony of Holy Writ or any other, 
that all things work together for such as loyally follow after charity 
and good conscience." Chicago Evening Post. 

" One of the best of the short stories of the day. The scene is located 
in the Ottawa valley, and the story is a strong presentation of a pecu- 
liar personality.'' Boston Journal. 

IN THE FIRE OF THE FORGE. 

A Romance of Old Nuremberg. By GEOKG EBERS, author 

of " Cleopatra," "An Egyptian Princess," "Uarda," etc. 

In two volumes. 16mo, paper, 80 cents ; cloth, $1.50. 

" A healthful story, not at all dependent upon any sensationalism. 
It shows the scholar and fine romancer in every passage." Chicago 
Inter Ocean. 

"Ebers knows his ground thoroughly. Local color abounds, and 
hints of old German customs give evidence of familiarity with history. ' ' 

Syracuse Post. 

THE WISH. 

A Novel. By HERMANN SUDERMANN. With a Biograph- 
ical Introduction by ELIZABETH LEE. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
" It is a comfort to obtain at last, in this country, through the me- 
dium of an excellent translation, an opportunity to become acquainted 
with Sudermann's much-talked-of novels. None who reads this remark- 
able tale, "The Wish,' as notable for its extreme simplicity as for its 
profound psychological insight, can fail to recognize its author as a nov- 
elist of the highest rank." Brooklyn Standard-Union. 

" In its simple detail of inward struggle with conscience, duty, love, 
it will be found fascinatingly interesting." Detroit Tribune. 

THE BONDMAN. 

By HALL CAINE, author of " The Manxman," " The Deem- 
ster," etc. New edition. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" The welcome given to this story has cheered and touched me, but 
I am conscious that, to win a reception so warm, such a book must have 
had readers who brought to it as much as they took away. ... I have 
called my story a saga, merely because it follows the epic method, and 
I must not claim for it at any point the weighty responsibility of history 
or serious obligations to the world of fact. But it matters not to me 
what Icelanders may call ' The Bondman,' if they will honor me by 
reading it in the open-hearted spirit and with the free mind with which 
they are content to read of Grettir and of his fights with the Troll." 

From Author's Preface. 



A STREET IN SUBURBIA. 

By EDWIN PUGH. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

"Rippling over from end to end with fun and humor." London 
Academy. 

"In many respects the best of all the books of lighter literature 
brought out this season. " Providence flews. 

" Thoroughly entertaining and more it shows traces of a creative 
genius something akin to that of Dickens " Boston Traveller. 

BOG -MYRTLE AND PEAT. 

Being Tales, chiefly of Galloway, gathered from the years 
1889 to 1895. By S. R. CROCKETT, author of " The Lilac: 
Sunbonnet," " The Stickit Minister," etc. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

" ' Bog-Myrtle and Peat ' contains some of the most dramatic pieces 
Mr. Crockett has as yet written." Philadelphia Press. 

" These stories are lively and vigorous, and have many touches of 
human nature in them, such touches as we are used to from having read 
'The Stickit Minister' and 'The Lilac Sunbonnet.'" New Haven 
Register. 

THE GODS, SOME MORTALS, AND LORD 
WICKENHAM. 

By JOHN OLIVER HOBBES, author of "Some Emotions and 
a Moral," etc. 12mo, cloth, with portrait of the author, 
$1.50. 

" The new novel by the lady who chooses to be known in literature 
as John Oliver Hobbes is announced by her publishers as the success of 
the season. . . . Mrs. Craigie, in short, has taken her place among the 
novelists of the day. It is a high place and a place apart. Her method 
is her own, and she stands, not exactly on the threshold of a great ca- 
reer, but already within the temple of fame." G. W. SH ALLEY, in the 
New York Tribune. 

MASTER AND MAN. 

By Count LEO TOLSTOY. Translated by A. HULME BEAMAN. 

With an Introduction by W. D. HOWELLS. 16mo, cloth, 

75 cents. 

" It is only a brief sketch, but it reveals a wonderful knowledge of 
the workings of the human mind of the natural impulses and the con- 
ventional habits that spring from environment and education and it 
tells a tale that not only stirs the emotions, but gives us a better insight 
into our own hearts." San Francisco Argonaut. 

THE STORY OF SONNY SAHIB. 

By Mrs. EVERARD COTES (Sara Jeannette Duncan), author 
of "Vernon's Aunt," "A Daughter of To-day," "An 
American Girl in London," etc. With 10 full-page illus- 
trations. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
" It is an exquisite story . . . the best that Mrs. Cotes has done and 

she is a brilliant writer." Chicago Times-Herald. 

" A capital boys' book. It has all the descriptive charm and easy 

flow of narrative which distinguished 'The Simple Adventures of a 

Memsahib."' New York Commercial Advertiser. 

MAJESTY. 

A Novel. By Louis COUPERUS. Translated by A. TEIXEIKA 
DEMATTOS and ERNEST DOWSON. l'2mo, cloth, $1.00. 
" There have been many workers among novelists in the field of royal 
portraiture, but it may be safely stated that few of those who have es- 
sayed this dubious path have achieved more striking results than M. 
Couperus. ' Majesty ' is an extraordinarily vivid romance of autocratic 
imperialism." London Academy. 

AN IMAGINATIVE MAN. 

By ROBERT S. HITCHENS, author of " The Green Carnation." 
12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

" The strength of the story lies almost entirely in atmosphere and 
character. It is, therefore, an extremely difficult thing to describe 
its charm from the outside, or to give any satisfactory indication of its 
power." London Weekly Sun.

Oh beati que' pochi che seggono a quella mensa ove il pane 
degli Angeli si mangia. Convito, I., 1. 

Pan degli Angeli, del quale 
Vivese qui, ma non sen vien satollo. 

Paradiso II., 11,12. 

We build and build; each generation's rise 

Brings us the old new question: what the way 
To shape the soul, and fit it for the fray 

That is the life of man. Shall these suffice 

The rule of thumb, the formula concise, 
The pedant's wisdom hoarded day by day ? 
Dry husks of fact do these the toil repay ? 

Shall this of all our labor be the price ? 

Nay, truth our aim, and truth is more than fact; 
Ere knowledge ripen into worthy act 

The spirit's glow must make it truth indeed, 
Of ardent aspiration all compact, 

Such truth as Dante won in sorest need, 
" Angelic bread " whereon the soul may feed.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT EDUCATION. 

At no previous time in the history of this coun- 
try has the discussion of educational questions 
been so serious a preoccupation as it is at pres- 
ent. During the past quarter of a century we 
have become pretty thoroughly awakened, not 
so much to the importance of education, which 
has never been questioned, as to the import- 
ance of establishing education upon the right 
foundation, and of conducting it in accordance 
with the most enlightened methods. So great 
a fermentation in so important a department 
of thought is, of course, a desirable thing, even 
if its blessings be not wholly unmixed. It is 
well occasionally to shake off our torpor, to get 
out of ruts, to avoid stagnation at almost any 
cost. But such a condition of intellectual un- 
rest, such a determination to reexamine the old 
grounds of the faith, is always fraught with the 
danger that we may, in our haste to make all 
things new, sweep away the good with the bad, 
and discard some of the fundamental principles 
of the philosophy of a sound education. 

Many zealous advocates of what they are 
pleased to call " the new education " are so 
thoroughgoing in their notions that the tem- 
perate onlooker is compelled to view their pro- 
posed policy somewhat askance. They would 



106 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



have us believe that the world has hitherto been 
all astray, that the educational wisdom of the 
ages is little better than foolishness, that we are 
upon the eve of a reform in our practice which 
is to be nothing less than revolutionary in its 
effect. These theorists complain, briefly, that 
education has in the past been made too much 
a matter of words ; the remedy they offer is to 
make it in the future chiefly a matter of things. 
To bring about this radical change, it is pro- 
posed to displace, to a great extent, the sterile 
practices of literary, philological, and historical 
study, by the productive practices with which 
physical science acquaints us ; to substitute for 
the study of man in his social and political 
character the study of man in his character as 
a tool-making and tool-using animal, mainly 
intent upon material comfort and progress. 
The educational tendency here suggested is 
very marked at the present day, and the signs 
of the times in many ways force it upon our 
attention. It is a tendency more marked, per- 
haps, during recent years than ever before, 
and more marked, probably, in our own country 
than in any other. This is a fact easily to be ac- 
counted for. The development of physical sci- 
ence is the dominant intellectual characteristic 
of the age, and this development, with its count- 
less implied possibilities of material ameliora- 
tion, has diverted many eyes from those things 
of the spirit that are so essential to the higher 
welfare of mankind, fixing them instead upon 
the objects which their lower natures demand ; 
it has, in a word, substituted ideals of comfort 
for ideals of virtue and of the full-statured life 
of the soul. And this diversion of attention 
from the higher to the lower aims of life, this 
substitution of lesser ideals for greater, of ig- 
noble for noble purposes, has been nowhere 
else so nearly complete as in this country of 
unexampled material resources and unexam- 
pled material prosperity. 

Matthew Arnold, in one of his essays on re- 
ligious subjects, has a passage exactly descrip- 
tive of our too prevalent attitude toward the 
educational problem. This passage, with the 
necessary substitution of " the humanities," or 
some such phrase, for the word " religion," runs 

f n " 

as follows : 

" Undoubtedly there are times when a reaction sets 
in, when an interest in the processes of productive indus- 
try, in physical science and the practical arts, is called 
an interest in things, and an interest in [the humanities] 
is called an interest in words. People really do seem to 
imagine that in seeing and learning how buttons are 
made, or papier mdche, they shall find some new and 
untried vital resource; that our prospects from this sort 



of study have something peculiarly hopeful and ani- 
mating about them; and that the positive and practical 
thing to do is to give up [the humanities] and turn to 
them." 

Now a great many sincere and well-meaning 
people have been telling us of late that " the 
positive and practical thing to do " in educa- 
tion is to set aside such useless studies as 
" mere " history and literature, as " dead " lan- 
guages and ancient civilizations ; to restrict 
considerably the attention paid to most other 
kinds of " book " learning ; and to devote the 
time thus reclaimed from waste to such scien- 
tific and even manual pursuits as are likely to 
have some direct bearing upon the everyday 
life of the men and women that our school- 
children are so soon to become. 

Half-truths are often more dangerous than 
downright errors, and the consequences of the 
sciolist theory of education just outlined are in 
many directions manifest. For one thing, there 
is the loud outcry, heard in many quarters, for 
the introduction of " manual training " into our 
common-school systems, not as an adjunct to 
intellectual training, which it may very prop- 
erly become, but as a substitute for what is 
contemptuously styled the Wortkram of the 
old-fashioned systems. One persistent advo- 
cate of this particular nostrum goes so far as 
to say that in the ideal school of his imagining 
" the highest text-books are tools, and how to 
use them most intelligently is the highest test 
of scholarship." In the field of higher educa- 
tion, the same spirit is illustrated by the im- 
mense expansion of the technological and sci- 
entific departments of our universities, at the 
expense, too often, of the humanities, and by 
the determined warfare that has been waged, 
during the past score of years, upon the clas- 
sical and other branches of the older education. 

In the development of the current popular 
opinion upon this all-important subject, we may 
distinguish two phases. To begin with, science, 
in the first flush of its great mid-century achieve- 
ments, put forth the arrogant plea that it alone 
was deserving of serious consideration as an 
educational discipline. Mr. Spencer's famous 
tractate upon " Education " seemed to give 
cogency to this plea, and for a time did duty 
as a sort of gospel of the new dispensation. 
But the narrowness and inadequacy of that 
gospel became, after a while, apparent even to 
the less reflective of minds, and a new doctrine 
emerged to fit the altered educational attitude. 
That doctrine, which has lately been urged with 
considerable eloquence, is, substantially, that

all subjects are equally valuable as intellectual 
disciplines, and that physics and biology, if 
pursued in the proper spirit, are as potent to 
build up the full-statured life as are history, 
and literature, and philosophy. But there are 
now indications that a third phase of the dis- 
cussion is at hand, and that the question of 
relative educational values is about to receive 
a more searching examination than it has ever 
had before. And, in this connection, it is in- 
deed significant that the President for 1895 of 
the National Educational Association, in pre- 
paring his inaugural address, should have felt 
that the time was ripe to use such words as the 
following : 

" If it be true that Spirit and Reason rule the universe, 
then the highest and most enduring knowledge is of the 
things of the Spirit. That subtle sense of the beauti- 
ful and the sublime which accompanies spiritual insight, 
and is part of it, is the highest achievement of which 
humanity is capable. . . . The study of nature is en- 
titled to recognition on grounds similar to those put 
forward for the study of literature, of art, and of his- 
tory. But among themselves these divisions of knowl- 
edge fall into an order of excellence as educational ma- 
terial that is determined by their respective relations 
to the development of the reflective Reason. The ap- 
plication of this test must inevitably lead us, while hon- 
oring science and insisting upon its study, to place above 
it the study of history, of literature, of art, and of in- 
stitutional life." 

Contrasted with such an ideal as this of the 
well-ordered education, how poor are all ideals 
that but proclaim the watchword of a narrow 
practicality. One of the finest expressions ever 
given to the nobler view is embodied in this pas- 
sage from Newman's " Idea of a University ": 

" That perfection of the Intellect, which is the result 
of Education, and its beau ideal, to be imparted to indi- 
viduals in their respective measures, is the clear, calm, 
accurate vision and comprehension of all things as far 
as the finite mind can embrace them, each in its place, 
and with its own characteristics upon it. It is almost 
prophetic from its knowledge of history; it is almost 
heart-searching from its knowledge of human nature; 
it has almost supernatural charity from its freedom 
from littleness and prejudice; it has almost the repose 
of faith, because nothing can startle it; it has almost 
the beauty and harmony of heavenly contemplation, so 
intimate is it with the eternal order of things and the 
music of the spheres." 

Nor does this higher aim concern the advanced 
stages of educational work alone. It should 
be an inspiring force in the kindergarten no 
less than in the college ; for the child, as well 
as the man, does not live by bread alone, un- 
less, indeed, it be that "pan degli Angeli " 
whereof Dante tells us. " Those few," he says, 
" are blessed who sit at the board " where it is 
eaten. Let it be our task to make the few the 
many, and the largess such as knows no stint.

THE LIFE or A "TYPICAL, ENGLISHMAN."* 

Mr. Leslie Stephen's Life of his brother, Sir 
James Fitzjames Stephen, is an admirable bio- 
graphy which may be read with interest even 
by those who care little for its ostensible theme. 
Fitzjames Stephen, eminent alike as journalist, 
judge, jurist, and writer on polity and jurispru- 
dence, seems to have corresponded pretty closely 
in his general make-up with what we Americans 
have in mind when we speak of the " typical 
Englishman " a type perhaps on the whole 
more forcible and virile than engaging. A rug- 
ged, combative, unpliable man, massive alike 
intellectually and physically, he could well 
afford to accept life (as we think he did accept 
it, under qualification) as an ordered form of 
the Hobbesian war of each against all a grand 
trial of individual strengths, regulated by gov- 
ernment charged mainly with the duty of keep- 
ing the lists and seeing fair play between the 
competitors. All Fitzjames Stephen asked for 
himself in the contest was a fair field and no 
favors ; and we fancy he had a hearty contempt 
for anyone who asked for more. Our social 
ideals are constructed, however unconsciously, 
with reference to our own personal needs and 
aptitudes ; and Fitzjames Stephen, a born ath- 
lete, was naturally not averse to an order of 
things in which the race is to the swift and the 
battle to the strong. We find him once frankly 
declaring (though he seems to have been rather 
ashamed of the sentiment afterwards) that " to 
be stronger than other people, and to have one's 
own will as against them, is the deepest and 
most general of human desires. If it were a 
wish which fulfilled itself, how very strong and 
how very triumphant I should be." His bio- 
grapher hastens, with brotherly solicitude, to 
style this outbreak " a mere passing velleity "; 
but it seems characteristic enough of the speaker. 

The opening chapters contain a brief history 
of the Stephen family, dating from the early 
part of the last century, and beginning with 
James Stephen, a thrifty Aberdeenshire small 
farmer, " with no insuperable objection to deal- 
ing in contraband articles." The Stephens 
were a strong and prolific race, hardy and en- 
terprising, fruitful of fine women and stalwart 
men. Of James, the third son of the Aber- 
deenshire farmer, a young giant of six feet

three inches, tradition says that when a friend 
once offered him a pony to carry him home 
after dinner, " he made and won a bet that he 
would carry the pony." As an amusing con- 
trast to this Titan may be mentioned a member 
of the family by marriage, one Mr. Garratt, 
a barrister of high character and standing, 
though a dwarf in stature. " Mr. Garratt ! " 
an irascible judge once shouted, " when you 
are addressing the court you should stand up." 
" I am standing up, my lord." " Then, Mr. 
Garratt, you should stand upon the bench." 
"I am standing upon the bench, my lord," 
meekly rejoined Mr. Garratt. Sir James Ste- 
phen, grandson of the smuggling ancestor and 
father of Fitzjames and Leslie, was a really 
eminent man. As under Secretary of State 
for the Colonies, he " literally ruled the Col- 
onial Empire," and seems to have been in his 
quiet way a masterful character, albeit cursed 
with a shyness beyond, said a colleague, " all 
shyness you could imagine in anyone whose 
soul had not been preexistent in a wild duck." 
A shining Evangelical light, Sir James was 
ascetic by temperament, hating long dinners, 
abhorring port wine, and appearing to his sons 
a sort of living " categorical imperative." " Did 
you ever know your father do a thing because 
it was pleasant?" Lady Stephen once asked 
one of her children. " Yes, once when he 
married you," was the young courtier's neat 
reply. Sir James himself used to say, and it 
was no empty boast, that he was one of the few 
people to whom it was the same thing to eat a 
dinner and to perform an act of self-denial. 
He once smoked a cigar, and found it so de- 
licious that he never smoked again ; and he in- 
dulged in snuff until it suddenly occurred to 
him that snuff was superfluous, when the box 
was solemnly emptied out of the window and 
never refilled. 

Fitzjames Stephen was born on March 3, 
1829 ; and, if the maternal record of his in- 
fantile doings and sayings is to be trusted, he 
was a remarkable child indeed, a young non- 
conformist much given to reflection on precepts 
which are commonly taken on trust, and filled 
with notions which resolutely declined to run 
in the regulation moulds. At four we find him 
sagely refusing to join in a hymn which ex- 
presses a premature desire " to die and be with 
God," on the ground that even good people 
may prefer to stay in this world ; and, later, 
he evolves a kind of Benthamee - Christian 
theory that, as naughtiness is extremely pleas- 
ant in itself, and as we know that it is finally 



expiable by repentance, the true rule would be 
" to be naughty all your life, and to repent just 
at the end," thereby, we suppose, securing the 
greatest possible measure of bliss in this world, 
without unduly drawing on one's account in 
the next. Fitzjames's first school, at Brighton, 
was a sort of spiritual forcing-house, a young 
prig's paradise, where there was no cricket, no 
fighting, no fagging, and an excess of evan- 
gelical theology. At prayers (they were nearly 
always at prayers) the boys used to be ques- 
tioned : " Gurney, what's the difference be- 
tween justification and sanctification ? " " Ste- 
phen, prove the omnipotence of God," and 
so on. Rescued betimes from Brighton, Fitz- 
james was sent to Eton, where, it is needless to 
say, there was plenty of fighting and fagging, 
and no evangelical or other theology to speak 
of. A tutor once rather naively excused this 
lack on the ground that he " was always of 
opinion that nothing was so important for boys 
as the preservation of Christian simplicity "; 
and Fitzjames always considered the answer a 
" perfectly admirable " one. Partly because 
he was an " up-town boy " he lived with his 
parents at Windsor, and not in college and 
partly because of his rather unsocial turn, Fitz- 
james was at first dreadfully bullied at the 
shrine of " Henry's holy shade." But he pres- 
ently grew so tall and strong that it was dan- 
gerous to attack him. As pugnacious as Keats, 
the once passive victim became a doughty cham- 
pion in his turn. Says an old Etonian : 

" Often have I applauded his backhanders as the fore- 
most in the fray. He was only vanquished by numbers. 
His bill for hats must have amounted to a stiff figure, 
for my visions of Fitzjames are of a discrowned war- 
rior, returning to Windsor bareheaded, his hair moist 
with the steam of recent conflict. . . . The kicks, cuffs, 
and hat-smashing had no other result than to steel his 
mind forever against oppression, tyranny, and unfair- 
ness of every kind." 

We do not find that Fitzjames was among 
the crack verse-makers at Eton, or that he spe- 
cially distinguished himself in any way save 
pugilistically ; but he there learned the lesson 
which he never forgot, that to be weak is to be 
wretched, that the state of nature is a state of 
war and Vce Victis Nature's primal law. His 
recollections of Eton (like his brother's) are 
not wholly flattering : 

" The teaching was ' wretched ' ; the hours irregular 
and very unpunctual ; the classes were excessively large, 
and the tutorial instruction supposed to be given out of 
school frequently neglected. ' I do not believe,' says my 
brother, ' that I was ever once called on to construe at 
my tutor's after I got into the fifth form. . . .' Bal- 
ston, our tutor, was a good scholar after the fashion of

the day and famous for Latin verse; but he was essen- 
tially a commonplace don. ' Stephen major,' he once 
said to my brother, ' if you do not take more pains, how 
can you ever expect to write good longs and shorts ? If 
you do not write good longs and shorts, how can you 
ever be a man of taste ? If you are not a man of taste, 
how can you ever hope to be of use in the world ? ' a 
sorites, says my brother, which must be somewhere de- 
fective." 

A man of taste Stephen major certainly 
never became, though he acquired a forcible 
and even brilliant prose style. For art he cared 
little, and for poetry less. He honestly con- 
fessed, to the dismay of the judicious Balston, 
that he could not see why people wrote poetry 
at all. " When a man has anything to say, I 
am always tempted to ask why he cannot say 
it in plain prose." The Eton course was fol- 
lowed by two rather profitable years at King's 
College, London, where the principal, Dr. Jelf, 
represented the high and dry, cock-sure form 
of Anglicanism. Says our author : 

" I can remember how, a little later, I used to listen 
with wonder to his expositions of the Thirty-nine Arti- 
cles. What a marvellous piece of good fortune it was, 
I used dimly to consider, that the Church of England 
had always hit off precisely the right solution in so 
many and such tangled controversies ! " 

At King's College, Fitzjames was much at- 
tracted by Professor Maurice, and for the time 
fancied himself more or less of a Mauricean. 
Afterwards, in his skeptical days, he used to 
say, picturesquely enough, of Maurice's preach- 
ing that it was like " watching the struggles of 
a drowning creed." 

In 1847 Fitzjames entered Cambridge. The 
Cambridge of those days, says Mr. Leslie Ste- 
phen, had merits now too likely to be under- 
valued ; but the course was strangely narrow. 
To adapt a phrase of Hume's, she virtually 
said to her pupils : "Is this a treatise upon 
geometry or algebra ? No. Is it, then, a treat- 
ise upon Greek or Latin grammar, or on the 
grammatical construction of classical authors ? 
No. Then commit it to the flames, for it con- 
tains nothing worth your study." In both these 
arenas, Fitzjames was comparatively weak. He 
had neither head nor heart for mere scholar- 
ship, was clumsy at calculation, and lacked the 
docility which so often enables a merely clever 
and teachable boy to outfoot rivals of ten times 
his real power and originality the latter a 
quality which " tempts a man outside the strait 
and narrow path leading to the maximum of 
marks." So, despising at heart what he con- 
sidered the trivial standards and empty pedan- 
tries of the place, Fitzjames left Cambridge 
without academical honors. 



Three times in life Fitzjames performed du- 
ties thoroughly consonant with his talents and 
temper : as journalist, as legal member of the 
Council at Calcutta, and as a judge on the crim- 
inal bench. 

In the last capacity the characteristics which 
impeded his fortunes at the bar where his 
career is described as a series of " tantalising 
half-successes" became distinctly advantages. 
His contempt of trickery ; willingness to give, 
and determination to have, fair play ; and his 
inbred disdain of all arguments not going to 
the substantial merits of the issue, were com- 
patible at least with high judicial qualities. 
Woe to the pettifogger who tried to eke out a 
flimsy case by playing on the foibles or throw- 
ing technical dust in the eyes of Judge Ste- 
phen ! Viewing himself as in some sort the 
organ of the moral sense of the community, he 
leaned rather to severity than mercy ; and 
when, after a fair trial, a man had been clearly 
proved before him to be a scoundrel, so far 
from affecting the usual reluctance in passing 
sentence, he showed rather the grim satisfac- 
tion of a man crushing a noxious reptile. Yet 
he showed, in doubtful cases, an almost pain- 
ful anxiety to secure fair play to the accused. 
One incident out of many of his love of exact 
justice may be quoted : 

" A man accused of stabbing a policeman to avoid ar- 
rest, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years' 
penal servitude. On being removed by the warders, he 
clung to the rail, screaming, 'You can't do it. You 
don't know what you are doing ! ' Fitzjames shouted 
to the warders to put him back; discovered by patient 
hearing that the man was meaning to refer to some cir- 
cumstance in extenuation, and after recalling the wit- 
nesses found that the statement was confirmed. < Now, 
you silly fellow,' he said, < if you had pleaded " not 
guilty," as I told you, all this would have come out. It 
is true that I did not know what I was doing, but it was 
your own fault.' He then reduced the sentence to nine 
months, saying, ' Does that satisfy you ? ' ' Thank you,' 
my Lord,' replied the man, ' that's quite right,' and left 
the court quite cheerfully." 

Stephen rigidly suppressed anything in the 
court-room tending to lower the dignity of the 
proceedings ; and it is recorded that when a 
spectator once laughed at a piece of evidence 
which should have disgusted him, he promptly 
had the fellow placed by the side of the pris- 
oner in the dock, and kept him there till the 
end of the case. The promiscuous attendance 
of ladies at " sensational " trials was the sharp- 
est of thorns in his side ; and he once gave 
offence by speaking of some persons of that sex 
who were fighting for admission as " women." 
Possibly this was during the trial of Mrs. May-

brick, a cause celebre at which he presided. 
It will be remembered that Mrs. Maybrick was 
convicted of the murder of her husband, and 
that her sentence was commuted (with Ste- 
phen's approval} to imprisonment for life, on 
the ground that, although there was no doubt 
that she had administered poison, it was pos- 
sible that her husband had died from other 
causes. Says Mr. Leslie Stephen : 

" A great deal of feeling was aroused; Fitzjames was 
bitterly attacked in the press, and received many anon- 
ymous letters full of the vilest abuse. Hatred of wo- 
men generally, and jealousy of the counsel for the de- 
fense, were among the causes of his infamous conduct 
suggested by these judicious correspondents. . . . But 
as attacks were made in public organs upon his behavior 
as judge, I think it right to say that they were abso- 
lutely without foundation. His letters show that he 
felt the responsibility deeply ; and that he kept his mind 
open till the last. From other evidence I have not the 
least doubt that his humanity and impartiality were as 
conspicuous in this as in other cases, and I believe were 
not impugned by any other witnesses, even by those 
who might doubt the correctness of the verdict." 

The author gives a detailed account of his 
brother's career in literature and journalism, 
at the bar and on the bench, and of his official 
work in India. The chapters analytical of his 
somewhat involved religious, philosophical, and 
political convictions are full of interest and sug- 
gestion. The work is finely mounted, and con- 
tains two excellent portraits.

FRANCE AND ENGLAND IN NORTH 
AMERICA.* 



Dr. Winsor's "Mississippi Basin," like his 
" Cartier to Frontenac," immediately suggests 
comparison with one of the best and most favor- 
ably known contributions to American history. 
Reference is made, of course, to Mr. Parkman's 
series of works that are collectively known as 
" France and England in North America." Save 
that Dr. Winsor, as befits his earlier title, passes 
by the Huguenots in Florida, to whom Mr. Park- 
man devotes ten thrilling chapters, the two writ- 
ers run side by side from first to last. The 
parallel is a suggestive one, and we shall follow 
it a little distance, since it will enable us to 
point out clearly the characteristic excellences 
and defects of Dr. Winsor's two works. 

Mr. Parkman's volumes are marked, in the 
first place, by the results of laborious and suc- 
cessf ul research. They are real contributions to

England and France, 1697-1763. With full cartographical 
illustrations from contemporary sources. By Justin Winsor.

knowledge. But, more than this, Mr. Parkman 
has used his materials, so conscientiously gath- 
ered, with excellent effect, combining and pre- 
senting them with such admirable literary skill 
that the series is a brilliant picture, on a great 
canvas, of the competition of England and 
France for dominion in North America. In 
the first of these particulars, Dr. Winsor is fully 
Mr. Parkman's equal : he is quite as thorough 
in investigation. Indeed, his books are not 
unlikely to impress some readers as the more 
learned of the two. But to literary art Dr. 
Winsor can lay no claims. He is often for- 
cible, and occasionally animated and pictur- 
esque ; but, on the whole, he carries his nar- 
rative as heavily as Mr. Parkman carries his 
lightly. It is owing in part to this difference, 
and in part to differences in ideal and subject- 
matter, that the unpracticed reader is likely to 
overrate, comparatively, the intrinsic value of 
Dr. Winsor's books, as suggested above. Ow- 
ing to these three causes ideal, matter, and 
style Dr. Winsor's volumes are not likely to 
prove attractive to the conventional general 
reader ; but historical students and scholars 
will hold them in highest estimation. 

It must be said that Dr. Winsor's researches 
have run mainly in a different channel from 
Mr. Parkman's ; or, to be more exact, that they 
have run mainly in one of the two channels in 
which the earlier writer moved. The sub-title 
of the earlier work, " Geographical Discovery 
in the Interior of North America in its Histor- 
ical Relations, with full Cartographical Illus- 
trations from Contemporary Sources," indi- 
cates what this channel is. Dr. Winsor is here 
seen at his best in a field that is peculiarly his 
own. It is a part of the field that he culti- 
vated with such good results in the " Narra- 
tive and Critical History of America " and in 
the " Christopher Columbus." He now returns 
to it for the purpose of a richer and more 
thorough tillage. It is true that the present 
work has the alternative title, " The Struggle 
in America between England and France"; 
but geographical discovery and exploration are 
still kept at the fore, and the cartographical 
illustrations, partially changed indeed in char- 
acter as the progress of history compels, are 
as abundant as ever. In a word, the writer's 
main purpose is to exhibit to his readers that 
gradual uncovering or disclosure which explor- 
ers of the North American continent made 
to the eyes of the civilized world from 1634 
to 1763, or at least so much of it as was in- 
volved in the competition of the two powers

with which he deals. The properly equipped 
reader who will read these pages, and study 
the accompanying maps, will see unrolled be- 
fore his eyes a panorama of events that, of their 
kind, are perhaps the most interesting that the 
world has seen. It is true that Mr. Park- 
man is also strong in this field ; but his work 
is much less minute, while the cartographical 
studies and illustrations are meagre indeed 
when compared with Dr. Winsor's affluence of 
such material. It is also to be said that, in 
respect to discovery, the one writer dwells more 
upon the merely historical aspects, the other 
upon the scientific aspects. The further re- 
mark is to be made that, although Dr. Win- 
sor's present sub-title is the same as the title 
of Mr. Parkman's series, the struggle, even 
relatively, is far less prominent in his pages. 
The value of Dr. Winsor's account lies far 
more in the indication of the causes that made 
the struggle inevitable, and that also predeter- 
mined its character and result, and especially 
the geographical causes, than in his handling of 
proper historical material. Parkman has given 
far more attention to the human, or strictly his- 
torical, aspects of the story. A few illustrations 
of the difference in method will be given. 

Parkman gives a chapter of thirty -eight 
pages to Deerfield ; Winsor barely alludes to 
it. Parkman finds two volumes necessary for 
dealing with the last act of the drama ; Win- 
sor dispatches it in one hundred pages. Park- 
man devotes three long chapters to Wolfe's 
great exploit ; Winsor, barely as many pages. 
Parkman lengthens out his account of the fall 
of Louisbourg into the hands of Pepperell and 
Warren, in 1745, until it fills two chapters of 
fifty-four pages ; Winsor finds a single para- 
graph of eleven lines sufficient. On the other 
hand, Winsor gives a much more minute and 
careful account of the establishment of the 
French settlements on the Gulf of Mexico and 
on the Lower Mississippi, and has a sharper 
eye for the progress of discovery in that quar- 
ter. Parkman, indeed, gives nearly forty pages 
to the heroic achievements of the La Verend- 
ryes in the far West, which is about twice the 
space Winsor thinks necessary ; but the ca- 
reers of these adventurous and self-forgetting 
men gave Parkman one of his good opportu- 
nities for the multiplication of historical detail 
and picturesque writing. And so we might go 
on, were it necessary to go further. 

It will be seen that we have chosen to char- 
acterize the work that Dr. Winsor has done 
in his present field rather than to deal partic- 



ularly with the book before us. This is because 
his qualities as historian are the same through- 
out. Eespecting the new book, it will suffice 
to say that he begins with defining the position 
of the rival claimants to North America at the 
close of the seventeenth century, indicating also 
the titles upon which they rested ; that he then 
draws the boldest and most comprehensive out- 
line of the grand natural features of our con- 
tinent to be found in any book of history ; that 
he then takes up the work of Iberville and Bien- 
ville on the Lower Mississippi ; that he closes 
with the completed occupation by the English, 
in 1765, of the empire that the French had 
yielded to them two years before ; and that 
every intervening chapter and page is filled 
with valuable information and discussion, the 
whole illustrated with such wealth of maps as 
to show that the author has really laid all lit- 
erature under contribution. An abstract of 
two of his later pages will at once illustrate his 
method, and at the same time show why the 
boundary which the Treaty of Paris gave to the 
United States in 1782 was an impossible one. 

While the upper waters of the Mississippi were not at 
this time [1763] supposed to be connected with the water- 
system of Hudson's Bay, the contemporary cartographers 
placed the river's source anywhere from latitude 45 to 
55. Jefferys thought it somewhat above 45. Samuel 
Dunn put it, a little later, under 46, and he clusters sev- 
eral lakes about the source. Buache, the French map- 
maker, places the fountain at 46, among the Sioux. 
A map based on Danville, and using material gathered 
by Governor Pownall, puts the source in a lake at 47, 
due south of the Lake of the Woods. The Dutchman, 
Vander Aa, in 1755, puts the springs doubtfully at 55, 
but in 1763 he finds reason to place a little group of 
three lakes, out of which the river flows from a triple 
source under 49. A French map, prepared for the 
Company of the West, establishes the head under 50. 
Bowen, in a map produced to show the treaty bounds, 
says the position of the source is uncertain, but that 
the Indians report it under 50, and in a marshy region. 
Robert Rogers says the Mississippi rises in a lake " of 
considerable bigness " into which flows a stream through 
a notch in the mountains, carrying a red substance. 

Some geographers still clung to an older notion of in- 
terlinking inland waters, flowing in different directions. 
It was common for these to connect the upper wa- 
ters of the Mississippi with a reticulation of lakes and 
streams having a dependence upon Hudson's Bay, and 
sometimes upon that mysterious channel which formed 
a union with the western sea. Roberts, an English car- 
tographer, in 1760, makes the Mississippi rise in Lake 
Winnipeg. Palairet, a French map-maker, connects the 
sources with Lake Winnipeg, though he acknowledges 
the upper parts of the channel are little known. He 
adds that some suppose there is a connection between 
the Mississippi or Missouri and the Manton (Mandan) 
River, which he represents by a dotted line as flowing 
ultimately into the Sea of the West. This same de- 
vice of an uncertain dotted line is used by Emanuel 
Bowen, in 1763, to join the upper Mississippi with the 



112 



[Sept. 1, 



Red River of the North. The Neptune Fran^aise has 
no hesitancy in connecting the Mississippi with Lake 
Winnipeg, and a most wonderful network of waters is 
supposed by Vander Aa on a map of 1755, where the 
Mississippi, Winnipeg, Lake Superior, and Hudson's 
Bay are all brought into a single system of communica- 
tion. In 1776 Jefferys connects Winnipeg with a fan- 
ciful inlet on the Pacific coast, which D'Aguilar is sup- 
posed to have entered in 1603. Explorers were still 
beguiled by the Indian tales of the connection of the 
Missouri by means of a string of interjacent lakes with 
the South Sea, and there were stories which induced 
Carver to believe that the Shining Mountains (Rockies) 
stretched from about 48 north latitude toward the south, 
and divided the waters flowing into the Gulfs of Mexico 
and California. He suspected that north of 48 there 
was a water-system somehow connecting Hudson's Bay 
with the Pacific, and lying somewhere thereaway were 
the Straits of Anian, " which, having been discovered 
by Sir Francis Drake, belong of course to the English." 

Even the most careful scholars commit blun- 
ders. Dr. Winsor brings La Salle to the shore 
of the Gulf of Mexico in 1681 (page 4), and 
Pineda to the mouth of the Mississippi in 1579 
(page 6). On page 279 he names the south 
branch of the Potomac where he evidently 
means the north branch. The index to the 
work is perhaps as complete as could reasona- 
bly be expected, but the lack of an analytical 
table of contents is a great drawback. Then 
Dr. Winsor, of all writers, should be the last 
to omit from such a work as this all references 
or other indications of his sources, save the 
very general ones that are found in the text.

THE LOWEST OF THE BACK-BONED 
ANIMALS.* 

Since the discovery of the vertebrate nature 
of the Lancelet, by Gabriel Costa, in 1834, this 
little creature has been an object of special in- 
terest to anatomists, to taxonomists, and to evo- 
lutionists alike. It is a vertebrate animal re- 
duced to its lowest terms, being deprived of 
all those structures with which the name ver- 
tebrate is usually associated. The Lancelet, or 
Amphioxus (in technical nomenclature, Bran- 
chiostoma) is fish-like in form and habit, but 
it is as far below or behind the fishes as man 
is above or beyond them. It lacks limbs, 
scales, skull, brain, jaws, eyes, ears, heart, red- 
blood, and vertebra. Its existence shows that 
all these structures are results of special de- 
velopment additions not essential to the 

* AMPHIOXUS AND THE ANCESTRY OF THE VERTFTJRATES.

lege, Balfour Student of the University of Cambridge. With

Biological Series, II.) New York : Macmillan & Co. 



primitive definition of a " back-boned animal." 
Of late it has been supposed that Bran- 
chiostoma is of the type of the primitive ver- 
tebrates, and that the study of its structure 
and embryology would give a clue to the steps 
by which the chordate or vertebrate animals 
had risen from worm -like forms. But this 
has not been certain, nor have the features of 
degeneration been clearly separated from those 
of primitive simplicity. 

In his work on " Amphioxus and the An- 
cestry of the Vertebrates," Dr. Willey treats 
in detail all these matters, with also an account 
of the Ascidians, Balanoglossus, and other 
types near the border-line between vertebrates 
and invertebrates. His final conclusions are 
thus expressed : 

" The proximate ancestor of the vertebrates was a 
free-swimming animal intermediate in organization be- 
tween an Ascidian tadpole and Amphioxus, possessing 
the dorsal mouth, hypophysis, and restricted notochord 
of the former; and the myotomes, ccelomic epithelium, 
and straight alimentary canal of the latter. The ulti- 
mate or primordial ancestor of the vertebrates would, 
on the contrary, be a worm-like animal whose organi- 
zation was approximately on a level with that of the 
bilateral ancestors of the Echinoderms." 

The eight species of Amphioxus are all 
placed by Dr. Willey in one genus, Amphi- 
oxus. As Dr. Gill has shown, the secondary 
modifications of this group are better shown, 
for purposes of classification, by its division 
into four genera, Branchiostoma, JEpigon- 
ichthys, Asymmetron, and Amphioxides. 

The book is a very valuable resume of our 
knowledge of a branch of zoology especially 
interesting in its relations to evolution.

Attacks, which they thought would be destructive 
in a high degree if not final, have passed by as mere 
episodes in a general development of religious be- 
lief. Conventional rites and creeds that seemed 
like barren fields exhausted by careless and routine 
tillage broken in on, no matter where or how, 
have shown a soil full of seeds, capable of astonish- 
ing life. If any faith has been stripped away, it 
has given place, like a felled forest, to another and 
equally abundant form of growth. This pertinacity 
of life has shown itself, on the one side, in the able 
and sturdy defence, even with a backward trend, 
of older forms of faith ; and on the other side, in 
the eagerness with which every new position is 
taken up in the spiritual world and fortified as if it 
had something of the nature of a finality. No bands 
of inquirers, even in science, are disposed to pitch 
their camp for a single night without throwing out 
some defensive works on the side of religious belief. 
The one omnipresent thought with men, more than 
ever before, is : How do these facts bear on man's 
spiritual hopes? We are impressed anew with this 
perennial flow of faith by the range, force, and 
depth of the works before us for review. With all 
the diversity of tendencies they present, there is no 
languor nor indifference. 

" As Others Saw Him " is a well-written, agree- 
able book. It is not a product simply of the imag- 
ination, but an effort to construct, pictorially and 
historically, the farther side, the more unfamiliar 
side, of the life of Christ. The " others " in the 
title stand for those not his disciples, yet those whose 
interested attention was called out by Christ. The 
author strives to restore the impression which the 
presence and words of Christ must have made upon 
them. In doing this he avails himself, not merely 
of the Gospel narrative, but also of all sayings and 
representations afloat in " patristic literature." 
Works of this cast encounter a difficulty hard to 
escape. Events that are intensely momentous, pre- 
eminently historical, can accept only with some con- 
fusion of impression, and shock of feeling, an im- 
aginary form. Earnest minds prefer a severely 
critical method that does not admit of any slurring 
of the facts, or of the evidence on which they rest. 
The author, however, uses the freedom of an imag- 
inary restoration of the life of Christ with forbear- 
ance and good taste. 

" A Creedless Gospel and the Gospel Creed " is 
a comprehensive, able, and abating one's own be- 
lief that it is inadequate a profound work. It is 
an earnest plea for the supernatural character and 
force of the leading facts and doctrines of Christian 
faith as presented in the Apostolic Creed. It is 
divided into three parts. The first part endeavors 
to show the inadequacy of the grounds of belief 
which have been given by science, philosophy, ethics, 
natural religion, and social growth. The second 
part presents, on the positive side, the chief events 
on which Christianity rests, as the author conceives 
it : the self -revelation of God, the incarnation, the 



crucifixion, the resurrection, the ascension, the Holy 
Ghost, the church, the judgment. The third part 
is a brief enforcement of Christian courage, knowl- 
edge, joy in the presence of this supernatural light. 
The book is well-fitted to impress the mind with a 
sense of the zeal and the redemptive power of the 
old forms of faith. Here is the true seed broken 
indeed for many of us and left behind by the divine 
process of growth out of which emerges the spir- 
itual life of man. The work is too wide and thorough 
in its scope to be criticized hastily, or to be advan- 
tageously found fault with, in single details. We 
draw attention to a few of the general considerations 
which have made, and still make, against an inflex- 
ible defence of the supernatural as hitherto con- 
ceived. The words of Christ, defining our relations 
to God, are the very essence of naturalism. If we 
make religion a field foreign to science, to philoso- 
phy, to morality, to society, we, at the same time, 
make science, philosophy, morality, and society in 
the same measure fields foreign to religion. We 
break the harmony of the universe. We oppose 
religion to the universe. Evolution, rightly ren- 
dered, must find its way, does find its way, into 
religious faith. Faith can not be opposed to rea- 
son or put above reason. Reason must be ultimate. 
When faith at any point transcends reason, it owes 
its acceptance in that relation to reason itself. 

" The United Church of the United States " is a 
volume made up chiefly of essays addressed, at var- 
ious times, to distinguished assemblies and to the 
public on the question of Church Unity. The au- 
thor has been, for a long time, a prominent ex- 
pounder and advocate of this unity. The book is 
a full and accumulative presentation on the writer's 
part of this discussion. It seems to us character- 
ized by an extravagant estimate of the importance 
of the theme, and by vagueness in its presentation. 
The first assertion of the preface is : " It has been 
becoming evident to many thoughtful observers that 
the chief Christian problem of our age is the Re- 
union of Christendom." This, in view of the social 
and spiritual questions at issue with us, seems a 
very extreme assertion. The author misconceives 
the value of an outer unity. "But surely, if 
social ills are fast coming to a crisis, it is folly to 
ignore them ; and if organized Christianity is their 
only perfect remedy it is madness to withhold that 
remedy " (p. 260). The vagueness of the work is 
in keeping with the over-estimate of its subject. 
The unity of the Church may be spiritual or formal. 
The two, however, in clear discussion must be kept 
apart. We may dwell at liberty on the need of 
spiritual unity, and nobody will say us nay. The 
moment we propose some distinct formal union, 
most persons will lapse into indifference ; many will 
violently oppose it ; and the advantages to be gained 
by it will rapidly disappear. The author seems to 
us to stand with one foot on the land the firm 
land of spiritual unity and the other on the sea 
the sea of rites and creeds still indeterminate in

men's minds, and to be very careful not to throw 
his weight forward into the position next in order 
a distinct form of union. The dispersive results 
of intellectual activity are not yet complete. The 
truly vital forces are still explorative and devisive. 
It is vain to try to bring them together till they 
begin to come together. If Episcopacy in England 
were to-day to be disestablished, it would be very 
likely to drop into three parts, a high church, a 
low church, a broad church. Formal unity is to be 
gained by interior growth and lies far in advance 
of us. 

"The Bibles and Beliefs of Mankind" is an 
after-clap of the Parliament of Religions. It is 
made up of three parts : The Bibles and Beliefs of 
Mankind with liberal quotations ; Churches and 
Communions associated with Christianity; Parlia- 
mentary Utterances. It is popular and pictorial in 
form, and has especially some fine portraits of those 
who took part in the Assembly of 1893. It is an 
effort still farther to utilize the wide impressions 
made by that expressive, fruitful, and somewhat 
scenic assembly The Parliament of Religions. 

" Life Here and Hereafter " is a volume of ser- 
mons ; the earlier ones on immortality, the later 
ones on various subjects. They are republished from 
corrected newspaper reports. They are not remark- 
able for literary excellence, for critical investigation, 
or for unusual spiritual insight. Taken, however, as 
sermons, as plain, practical, and earnest enforcement 
of accepted truths, they are much to be commended. 
There is nothing in them conventional on the one 
side, nor sensational on the other. There is only 
a simple, well-proportional effort to draw from the 
truth, as apprehended by speaker and listener, its 
appropriate impulses. They are good sermons. 
They do credit to the integrity of mind and heart 
both of the speaker and of his audience. They have 
also a fair breadth of theme, touching on such top- 
ics as Party Spirit, Capital and Labor. They are 
such discourses as do most men good to hear or read. 
The last two volumes on our list rightly claim the 
attention of all whose view of the world in which 
we are has first received the expansion of scientific 
thought, and is now coming under its limitations. 
The human mind by being too long or too exclus- 
ively occupied with one class of themes, or one 
method of inquiry, suffers something very like atro- 
phy. This atrophy, unfortunately, lies, most of it, 
in our time, in the direction of spiritual truth. 
These two books in very different ways should at 
least serve to disclose this atrophy to those who suf- 
fer from it, and to correct it with those not con- 
firmed in it. The Foundations of Belief " is the 
product of a very active, wide-ranging mind, and 
one fairly familiar with, and impressible by, the 
facts and arguments of naturalism. Without this ap- 
preciation, nothing can now be said to much purpose 
in defense of faith. The drift of the book is well put by 
the author at the opening of the fourth part. " We 
have now considered beliefs, or certain important 



classes of them, under three aspects. We have con- 
sidered them from the point of view of their practical 
necessity ; from that of their philosophic proof ; and 
from that of their scientific origin. Inquiries relating 
to the same subject-matter more distinct in their char- 
acter it would be difficult to conceive. It remains for 
us to consider whether it is possible to extract from 
their combined results any general view which may 
command at least a provisional assent" (p. 241). 
The treatment will constantly call out dissent, but 
it will also as constantly open up wider views than 
those which become habitual in naturalism, and will 
confront its assertions with corrective principles. 
The author, without dogmatism, has a strong hold 
on the spiritual elements in our nature, and walks 
by reason, not as a veiled *lantern, which casts its 
entire light on the particular path pursued, but as 
one which sends some disclosure in all directions. 
We commend the book as well fitted to help the 
mind out of narrow and positive opinions into wide, 
open possibilities. The naturalism, whose weak- 
nesses Mr. Balfour exposes in many effective ways, 
is that complete naturalism which rests on a purely 
empirical philosophy. This naturalism, as a final 
and adequate theory, receives no quarter at his 
hands. The gist of the book is found in the relation 
of reason and authority as sources of belief. The 
author magnifies authority. Yet the ninety-nine 
persons and opinions resting on authority have less 
philosophical interest and importance than the one 
hundredth person and opinion making an appeal to 
reason. These are the points of growth. Mr. Bal- 
four's enforcement is the enforcement of a states- 
man rather than of a philosopher. 

"Thoughts on Religion" is remarkable in the 
same direction, but in another fashion. George 
John Romanes, during his whole life, was closely 
identified with inquiries involved in evolution, espe- 
cially with those which unite in development the 
intellectual powers of animals and of men. Unlike 
Darwin, however, he constantly interested himself 
in the speculative bearings of the facts under dis- 
cussion. " Theism," published by him some years ago 
under the designation of " Physicus," was a very 
thorough presentation of the grounds of unbelief. 
It showed no hesitancy in reaching its conclusions. 
He was a man of candor and of restless inquiry, 
and the present volume presents accumulated mem- 
oranda of beliefs slowly forming in his mind, that 
looked toward a complete even more complete 
than many believers would accept reconstruction 
of faith. As this reconstruction is as purely ra- 
tional as the destruction which preceded it, the fact 
is most significant. Both books will make the mind 
a broader and better instrument in the search for 
truth.

RECENT POETRY.* 



Among the English poets of the later Victorian 
period, contemporary criticism has made a fairly 
sharp distinction between the six dii majores of song 
and the host of minor versifiers. The consecrated 
group that includes Tennyson and Browning, Ar- 
nold and Rossetti, Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Morris, 
seems now to be separated by a pretty deep and 
definite gulf from the other occupants of the hill of 
Parnassus, and it is not probable that posterity will 
take a different view of the situation. Here and 
there a plea will doubtless be made for the admis- 
sion of some outsider or other into the charmed cir- 
cle of the elect, but we doubt if any of these will 
obtain the requisite suffrages. Among those who 
will, however, come the nearest to such apotheosis 
are two or three whose work has been practically 
unknown to the generation in which they have lived, 
for the simple reason that they have not chosen to 
strive for the plaudits of the crowd. Such a poet 
is Mr. Robert Bridges, who has until recently been 
but a name and hardly that to lovers of poetry ; 
another such is Mr. Theodore Watts, who has only 
just now consented to the publication of a volume 
of his work. Still another is the author of the fol- 
lowing lines, descriptive of the ambition of Phae"- 
thon : 

" As when the rathe and poignant spring divine 
Sighs all too soon among the hoary woods, 
And from the fleecy drifts of sodden snow 
With promise and with perfume calls her buds, 
And the buds open when they hear her feet, 
And open but to perish. So his heart 
Bloomed in a burst of immortality, 
Nor feared the onward rolling vans of doom. 
Yearning he had and hunger to ascend, 
To sit at endless feast with purple robes 
To fold his limbs in sheer magnificence, 
With rays of glory round his radiant hair, 
And deity effulgent in his brows :

BLUE AND GOLD. By William S. Lord. Chicago: The 
Dial Press. 



A dream divine, whose passionate desire 

Flooded his soul, till in the golden car 

He trembled at the vision : as a leaf 

Moved by a gale of splendour, that comes on, 

When, at the point of sunrise, the wind sweeps 

With sudden ray and music across the sea. 

So in that rapture of presumptuous joy 

He spake a dreadful and impious word ; 

That he was nature's lord and king of gods, 

He cared not now for Zeus, how should he care ? 

Let the old dotard nod and doze above. 

He rode the morning in unchecked career, 

Apparelled in his sire's regalities, 

The new Hyperion, greater than his sire ; 

While the swift hooves beat music to his dream : 

And for a little while his heart was glad, 

Throbbing Olympian ichors. For an hour 

Elate, he bore an ecstasy too great 

For mortal nerve, and knew the pride of gods." 

This passage occurs in one of the longer of the sec- 
ond series of " Poems, Dramatic and Lyrical," by 
Lord De Tabley. It is blank verse that will bear 
a close examination ; that needs careful scrutiny, in 
fact, to disclose all of its subtle beauty. Its affini- 
ties seem to be partly Landorian and partly Ten- 
nysonian, although it misses the severity of the 
earlier and the exquisite dreamy languor of the later 
poet. More strictly Tennysonian are these stanzas : 

" I fain would have thee at my side, 

When Spring is reaching out her hands, 
When April, like a weeping bride, 
Sails o'er the rosy orchard lands. 

" When May winds bathe the reedy isles, 

Where swans are nesting with their broods, 
And sheets of sapphire pave for miles 
The floors of hyacinthine woods." 

Elsewhere, there may be found a touch of the sweet 
paganism that Mr. Swinburne so often sang for us 
in his earlier years. Swinburnian, although with a 
passion tuned to lower and more decorous pitch, is 
" A Hymn to Aphrodite," from which this stanza 
comes : 

" To thee, enwreathed with passion flowers, 

Our unreluctant prayers are given : 
Thou art so near, when other powers 

Seem worlds away in frigid heaven : 
They know not, for they live apart, 
The craving tumult of the heart." 

In " The Wine of Life," on the other hand, we hear 
such a grave philosophic note as Arnold so often 
gave us : 

" How idle for a spurious fame 

To roll in thorn-beds of unrest ; 
What matter whom the mob acclaim, 
If thou art master of thy breast ? 

" If sick thy soul with fear and doubt, 
And weary with the rabble din, 
If thou wouldst scorn the herd without, 
First make the discord calm within. 

" If we are lords in our disdain, 

And rule our kingdoms of despair, 

As fools we shall not plough the main 

For halters made of syren's hair." 

Yet with all these suggestions of other poets, we 
never feel that Lord De Tabley is an imitator. He 
speaks with his own voice, and we must hold either 
the Zeitgeist or the spirit of classical culture respon- 
sible for whatever similarities may be noted be-

tween his work and that of his contemporaries. 
The dignity of his thought and the knowledge which 
he displays (particularly of the intimate aspects of 
nature), added to the true poetic feeling that per- 
vades his work, warrant the belief that his place at 
the Victorian banquet-board will prove a high one, 
late-comer though he be at the feast. 

Mr. Lionel Johnson is one of the younger En- 
glish men of letters, and has heretofore been known 
by a number of delicate critical studies, mostly pub- 
lished in the English reviews. He now puts forth 
a volume of " Poems," gleaned from the work of 
something less than ten years, and bearing much 
evidence of thoughtful workmanship. The main 
current of the thought which they embody is one 
of religious mysticism, adorned with the symbols 
of the Romanist faith. Other influences at work 
in his verse are the racial feeling of the Celt, and 
the ideals of Greek and Latin literature. An elegiac 
strain pervades the work, and may be detected in 
many of the poems besides those that are frankly 
commemorative. The blending of classical and 
Christian motive is happily illustrated in the two 
poems, " Men of Assisi " and " Men of Aquino," the 
one singing of Propertius and St. Francis, the other 
of Juvenal and St. Thomas. We quote the open- 
ing and closing stanzas of the former poem : 

" A crown of roses and of thorns ; 
A crown of roses and of bay : 
Each crown of loveliness adorns 
Assisi, gleaming far away 
On Umbrian heights, in Umbrian day. 

" One bloomed, when Cynthia's lover sang 
Cynthia, and revelry, and Rome : 
And one his wounded hands did hang 
Whose heart was lovelier Love's dear home ; 
And his, an holier martyrdom. 

" O city on the Umbrian hills : 
Assisi, mother of such sons ! 
What glory of remembrance fills 
Thine heart, whereof the legend runs : 
These are among my vanished sons." 

The purely elegiac strain may be illustrated by the 
lines " To a Traveller." 

" Fare thee well, strong heart ! The tranquil night 
Looks calmly on thee : and the sun pours down 
His glory over thee, O heart of might ! 
Earth gives thee perfect rest : 
Earth, whom thy swift feet pressed : 
Earth, whom the vast stars crown." 

The religious vein of Mr. Johnson's verse, in one 
of its simpler aspects, finds beautiful expression in 
a prayer to the Virgin on behalf of a fishing hamlet. 

" Mary, Star of the Sea I 
Look in this little place : 
Bless the kind fisher race, 
Mary, Star of the Sea ! 

"Send harvest from the deep, 
Mary, Star of the Sea ! 
Mary, Star of the Sea ! 
Let not these women weep." 

We might illustrate another of the marked currents 
of the author's thought by the fine poem on " The 



Classics," but prefer to take the briefer " Sortes 

Virgilianae," a sonnet in alexandrines. 

" Lord of the Golden Branch, Virgil ! and Cassar's friend : 

Leader of pilgrim Dante ! Yes, things have their tears : 

So sighed thy song, when down sad winds pierced to thine ears 

Wandering and immemorial sorrows without end. 

And things of death touch hearts, that die : Yes ; but joys blend, 

And glories, with our little life of human fears : 

Rome reigns, and Caesar triumphs ! Ah, the Golden Years, 

The Golden Years return : this also the Gods send. 

" O men who have endured an heavier burden yet ! 

Hear you not happy airs, and voices augural ? 

For you in these last days by sure foreknowledge set, 

Looms no Italian shore, bright and imperial ? 

Wounded and worn ! What Virgil sang, doth God forget ? 

Virgil, the melancholy, the majestical." 

Arnold is the only other poet that we know of who 
has made such beautiful use of the sunt lacrymce 
rerum, 

" The Virgilian cry, 
The sense of tears in mortal things." 

The masterpieces of modern literature have inspired 
some of Mr. Johnson's best verses, and notably the 
poem upon the Bronte sisters, which has the follow- 
ing close : 

" Children of fire ! The Muses filled 
Hellas with shrines of gleaming stone ; 
Your wasted hands had strength to build 
Gray sanctuaries, hard-hewn, wind-blown. 

" Over their heights, all blaunched in storm, 
What purple fields of tempest hang ! 
In splendour stands their mountain form, 
That from the sombre quarry sprang. 

" Now the high gates lift up their head ; 
Now stormier music, than the blast, 
Swells over the immortal dead : 
Silent and sleeping, free at last. 

" But from the tempest, and the gloom, 
The stars, the fires of God, steal forth : 
Dews fall upon your heather bloom, 
royal sisters of the North ! " 

Our last citation shall be a fragment from the beau- 
tiful tribute to our own Hawthorne. 

" Hesperian soul ! Well hadst thou in the West 
Thine hermitage and meditative place : 
In mild, retiring fields thou wast at rest, 
Calmed by old winds, touched with aerial grace : 
Fields, whence old magic simples filled thy breast, 
And unforgotten fragrance balmed thy face." 

We have sought, in making the above quotations,, 
to represent Mr. Johnson, as every poet should be 
represented, by his best work, and there is little 
need to state how good that work. is. But it is due 
in -justice to say that much of his work is faulty r 
either in technique or in thought. There are many 
poems in which, while we are conscious of a profu- 
sion of poetical material, we must recognize that 
the material has not been properly elaborated ; the 
expression is diffuse and the thought far from clear. 
How imperfect the technique may be, a single verse 
will show. " Well couldst thou justify severe 
thoughts then " is a phrase which one would hardly 
suspect of being a verse, did it not occur in what is- 
clearly meant for a poem. Such a verse may fairly 
justify a few severe thoughts on the part of the 
critic, however well he may wish its author.

THE DIAL

A deep feeling of the unity of the universe finds 
expression in " Homeward Songs by the Way." To 
pierce through the veils of sense, discerning the 
transcendental realities beyond ; and then to inter- 
pret these realities in half-mystical language, yet 
with all the glow of sensuous imagery, this has 
been the essential task of the true poet whose per- 
sonality is modestly hidden beneath the initials that 
alone acknowledge authorship of the beautiful little 
book before us. " I moved among men and places," 
so runs the preface, " and in living I learned the 
truth at last. I know I am a spirit, and that I went 
forth in old time from the Self-ancestral to labours 
yet unaccomplished ; but filled ever and again with 
homesickness, I made these songs by the way." One 
is reminded over and over again of such poems as 
Emerson's " Brahma" and Mr. Swinburne's " Her- 
tha," even more, perhaps, of Vaughan's mystical 
song. " Dusk " is an exquisite example of this 
writer's work. 

" Dusk wraps the village in its dim caress ; 
Each chimney's vapour, like a thin grey rod, 
Mounting aloft through miles of quietness, 
Pillars the skies of God. 

" Far up they break or seem to break their line, 
Mingling their nebulous crests that bow and nod 
Under the light of those fierce stars that shine 
Out of the calm of God. 



" Only in clouds and dreams I felt those souls 
In the abyss, each fire hid in its clod ; 
From which in clouds and dreams the spirit rolls 
Into the vast of God." 

A second note of this collection, or rather a corol- 
lary of its main thesis, is foreshadowed in the words 
already quoted : " In living I learned the truth at 
last." The ultimate harmonies of thought must 
come to the soul as the resolution of the discords of 
life. Says " The Man to the Angel ": 

" I have wept a million tears. 
Pure and proud one, where are thine ? 
What the gain, though all thy years 
In unbroken beauty shine ? 

" All your beauty cannot win 
Truth we learn in pain and sighs : 
You can never enter in 
To the Circle of the Wise." 

One more example must suffice us, and this pair of 
quatrains it shall be : 

" I heard them in their sadness say 
' The earth rebukes the thought of God ; 
We are but embers wrapped in clay 
A little nobler than the sod.' 

" But I have touched the lips of clay : 
Mother, thy rudest sod to me 
Is thrilled with fire of hidden day, 
And haunted by all mystery." 

This is the poet's even nobler way of saying what 
Tyndall so nobly said in the Belfast address, when 
he swept away the reproach of materialism by bid- 
ding us view the material world in the new light of 
modern physical science. 



A few bluff and stirring ballads, some lyrics and 
meditative pieces in rough or unconventional metres, 
and a few classical echoes, are the contents of Mr. 
Beesly's " Ballads and Other Verse." The work, 
as a whole, displays poetic energy rather than poetic 
art, and but a moderate degree of either quality. 
The influence of Browning is very marked, as in 

" ' Life worth living ? ' Well, maybe 

Not by you, I agree, 
If the best of it you pawn 
For a yawn," 

or in the dramatic piece, "A Woman's Last Word " : 

" Dead ? Yes. I see him stark there on the bed, 

Thank God, stone-dead. 
Nor can I, as you preach to me I ought, 

Think one kind thought, 
Or say one soft word to his memory, 

Howe'er I try. 
' De Mortuis ' it is a fool who writes 

For hypocrites ; 
Better without false tear or feigned ruth 

The whole, black truth. 
God ! how I always hated him, and how 

I hate him now. 
By him, I tell you, even from the first, 

My life was cursed : 
He made me traitress to divinest trust, 

And his hands thrust 
Away whatever nobleness I had 

And made it bad, 
Whatever sweetness took my fancy thrall 

He turned to gall, 
Whatever woke in me of steadfast will 

He stifled still, 
Whatever spark was struck of generous flame 

He quenched in shame : 
Had he but made my body loth to live 

I could forgive, 
But not the mocking thief who stained and stole 

My very soul." 

The quotation must end here, but the whole piece 
is finely conceived. 

One half of Mr. Block's new volume of verse is 
made up of a single poem " The New World " 
published two years ago as " El Nuevo Mundo," and 
then reviewed in these pages. Of the remaining con- 
tents, the most important, or at least the most am- 
bitious, are the long poems upon Goethe, Dante, 
and Plato, and " The Friendship of the Faiths." 
The latter work, which was read at the Parliament 
of Religions in 1893, has also had previous publi- 
cation. Besides these lengthy productions, the vol- 
ume contains several carefully-finished sonnets, po- 
etical tributes to Lowell, Whitman, David Swing, 
and Alice Gary, and a few short lyrics. We hardly 
need to repeat upon this occasion the high estimate 
previously given of Mr. Block's work, of its opulent 
vocabulary, its dignity, its high seriousness, and, in 
the longer poems, its largeness of utterance. The 
defects of these qualities sometimes appear, indeed, 
for the vocabulary includes some words that had 
better have been spared, and the utterance, while 
large, is sometimes also a little thick. Mr. Block 
is best when his expression is most nearly simple, 
as in the following paraphrase of certain familiar 
Goethean ideas :

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



" He only wins his freedom truly, 
Who daily wins it fresh and fair ; 
He only rises ever newly 
Into the regions of the purer air 
Who falters not for blame nor praise, 
But lives in strenuous and victorious days. 
Past the times that bore and held him 
Looked the gray poet with his quenchless gaze, 
Some dear vision hovered and compelled him 
Toward the Future's sunnier ways. 
Over the ocean's welter westward 
Sped his hope and strengthening thought, 
Where each tenth wave rolled higher to crestward 
Even as Fate rose nobler wrought." 

This stanza from the poem on Dante is also an 
example of sincere and heartfelt expression : 

" We climbed that Mount where pain is held and sought 

As expiation of the luckless deed, 
We heard the hymns of deep contrition wrought, 
We saw the stars that glowed for each one's need ; 
We felt the mountain thrill, 
And knew some happier will 
Had found release from its long-harbored grief, 
And in the Heavens its fit and sure relief." 

Perhaps the most satisfactory thing in the whole 
volume is the Dante-suggested sonnet, " The Garden 
Where There Is No Winter," which readers of THE 
DIAL will remember. 

A delicate spirituality is also the predominant 
note in the " Sonnets and Lyrics " of Mrs. Trask, 
whose post -Arthurian idyls ("Under King Con- 
stantine") we had the pleasure of praising two or 
three years ago. This fine sonnet exhibits Mrs. 
Trask's work at its best : 

" I wander in the desert of this world, 
See God's effulgence for a moment's space 
On some Mount Sinai, then come face to fate 
With altars to the Golden Calf. Thus hurled 
From holy heights, my soul in depths is whirled ; 
Tea, from the Blessed swiftly to the base. 
Ah ! 't is a desolate and barren place ; 
My heart is weary ; but, behold I unfurled 
Before me floats a fleecy cloud of light, 
A roseate pillar through the toiling day, 
Illumining the desert's arid sand ; 
And, lo ! a vivid guiding flame by night. 
'T is Love that goes before me on my way, 
And leads me onward to the Promised Land." 

The chaste and tender diction of the poems from 
which this selection comes is unfailing in its charm, 
and the beauty of the soul which can thus express 
itself is everywhere manifest. 

The " Poems " contained in Father Tabb's mod- 
est little volume are the merest seed-pearls of song, 
so simple and unpretentious they are. Many of 
them are only quatrains, and few (the group of son- 
nets excepted) fill more than eight or ten lines. 
" Narcissus " is a good example : 

' ' The god enamoured never knew 
The shadow that beguiled his view, 
Nor deemed it less divinely true 
Than Life and Love. 

" And so the poet, while he wrought 
His image in the tide of thought, 
Deemed it a glimpse in darkness caught 
Of light above." 



The author is certainly an adept in the compact pre- 
sentation of detached thoughts ; his taste is well-nigh 
faultless, and the stamp of spirituality is upon every 
page of his book. 

Some one has cynically remarked that almost 
anyone can write sonnets, but that few can read 
them. Certain it is that the writing of sonnets is 
becoming more and more affected by the minor 
poets of England and America, and it is equally 
certain that many of these attempts at one of the 
most difficult of verse-forms serve mainly to illus- 
trate the well-known saying about reckless fools and 
timorous angels. The " Distaff and Spindle " of 
Mrs. Mary Ashley Townsend, for example, is a vol- 
ume containing nothing but sonnets sixty-nine of 
them ; and, while her verse displays much poetic 
sensibility and fineness of perception, it should have 
been cast in any mould other than that of the son- 
net. We do not now speak of such technical im- 
perfections as the scant verse " Odorous invisibil- 
ity," or of such lapses from poetic diction as " The 
phonograph, that marvel of our age," but rather of 
the fact that these pieces, far from being " moments* 
monuments," are nothing more than so many short 
didactic and discursive poems, among which one 
would seek in vain for other than accidental illus- 
trations of the fundamental principles of sonnet- 
structure. The example which we are about to 
quote comes far nearer than most of the poems to 
what a sonnet ought to be, and is chosen because it 
is always our wish, in these reviews of current verse, 
to represent a writer by the best that he has to 
give us. 

" Come forth, Beloved ! the hour has grown so still 
That I can almost hear the violets blow, 
And hear the sap stir in the palms below 
The lawn, and, listening, seem to hear that thrill 
The lily feels when, bending down to fill 
From urns of dusk her petals with the slow 
Sweet-odored dews that out of darkness grow, 
One ardent star comes trysting o'er the hill ! 
I believe that I could hear if even a thought, 
Or yearning glance, of thine this way should pass, 

Or if thy white soul beckoned me apart ; 
Love has a sense so delicately wrought 
That it could hear thy shadow cross the grass, 
Or thy chill silence drifting toward my heart I " 

We would say of this volume, in conclusion, that it 
would have been the gainer had the effort expended 
in searching for strange expressions and verbal 
effects been directed to the more important tasks 
of polishing the rhythm, illuminating the structure, 
and reducing by one the number of rhymes that the 
author has allowed herself in her sestets. 

What we have just said of Mrs. Townsend's son- 
nets applies also in considerable measure to those 
fifty or sixty in number in Mr. Nesmith's volume. 
Yet in this case the poetic energy is so marked, the 
stuff so various and well-fitted for treatment, and 
the thought so compact, that the failings of the 
poems considered strictly as sonnets become less 
apparent. Mr. Nesmith has studied good models 
Rossetti, Wordsworth, Milton and echoes from 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

them all at times strike the ear. What, for exam- 
ple, can be more Rossettian than this : 

" What drear encampment of encircling glooms, 
Or sick surmise of culminating fate, 
Can bid To-day put off her eddying plumes. 
Her orb, her ornaments, and purpled state " ? 

A certain austerity of feeling also not infrequently 
suggests Matthew Arnold or E. R. Sill, with the 
latter of whom the author seems to have no slight 
degree of spiritual kinship. One of the best of the 
sonnets is " Subtle Spring ": 

" What subtle touch upon what secret string, 
What naked bleakness of wind-withered bowers, 
What frozen barrenness of wintry hours, 
What sick surmise, forlorn imagining, 
Makes sad the haunting melody of Spring ; 
Her songs, her pomp, her verdure and her blooms, 
Her friends, her coronals, and eddying plumes, 
While all the cherubs of the morning sing ? 
Subtle as Sphinx is she, too subtly wise 
To dull the soul with undisturbed content ; 
But with suggestions sad and subtly blent, 
She weaves in her enchanting mystery 
Musings and thoughts that touch eternity, 
The songs of April and the breath of sighs." 

The spirit thus described is very different from the 
riotous Spring invoked by Mr. Charles Leonard 
Moore's magnificent sonnet, but it represents with 
no less fidelity its own temperamental point of view. 
It will be noticed from the quotations above made 
that Mr. Nesmith takes all sorts of liberties with 
the form of the sonnet, that if a phrase pleases his 
fancy he does not hesitate to use it more than once, 
and that he is not careful to avoid pressing a word 
too often into service in the same context. Five 
poems which are not sonnets are included in the 
volume, and one of them, " Philoctetes at Lemnos," 
gives it a title. We are less impressed by this frag- 
mentary imitation of Greek tragedy than by the 
fine " Hymn of Nature " that follows a poem of 
unusual imaginative power and felicity of phrase. 
On the whole, although the present volume hardly 
exhibits an advance upon the " Monadnoc " of six 
years ago, it sustains the note sounded by that note- 
worthy volume, and we are glad to repeat some- 
thing of the praise then bestowed by us upon the 
author in these pages. 

A copy of verses left among the manuscripts of 
the late Frank Bolles has just been published, and 
reveals that lover of nature in a new light. It is 
called " Chocorua's Tenants," and describes the say- 
ings and doings of a dozen or more of the birds of 
New England. It cannot be said that the author 
had the poetical gift in any marked degree, and 
these verses, in the trochaic metre of " Hiawatha," 
may be praised, not as verses, but simply as a new 
illustration of the author's fine and sympathetic 
quality of observation, of his intimate feeling for 
the message of nature of birds, and flowers, and 
rugged mountain fastnesses. One example is as 
good as another for our present purpose of illustra- 
tion, and hence, opening the book almost at random, 
we pluck from its pages these lines : 



" Midway in the month of roses, 
When beside the brook is blooming, 
Pure and shy, the sweet linnsea ; 
In the pines, among the beeches, 
On the boulders, cawing, scolding, 
All the crows in Crowlands gather. 
Then it is the young are learning 
How to stand and beat their pinions, 
How to caw, and croak, and bluster. 
Happy days those days in June-tide ; 
Days of feasting, days of plunder." 

Not upon mountain slopes, but " In Woods and 
Fields," are set the scenes of Miss Larned's mus- 
ings. They are pretty, tasteful lyrics, soaring to 
no heights, but tender with reflections of the beauty 
of nature in her restful moods. Let us take, for 
example, some verses written " At Evening ": 
" Within this hushed and sacred hour 
The silence blossoms like a flower, 
And color melts unseen away, 
And leaves the silver and the gray ; 
So thought gives place to vague content, 
The soul of music twined and blent 
With reveries dim and pleasing throng, 
A soundless chant, a wordless song." 

Another thin volume, Mrs. Poole's " A Bank of 
Violets," has natural beauty for its keynote, although 
the fancy sometimes wanders into the world of books 
and men. We cannot do better than reprint the 
opening triolet : 

" Were Poetry the sweet south breeze, 

To breathe upon my violets, 
Delight would thrill the neighboring trees 
Of Helicon ; and Fancy ease 

Her heart in far-heard triolets, 
Were Poetry the sweet south breeze 

To breathe upon my violets ! " 

Miss Susanna Massey's volume, " God's Parable 
and Other Poems," takes a wider range than the 
collection just mentioned, and finds inspiration in 
life rather than nature. Its contents include the 
long titular poem a sort of dramatic idyl some 
bits of French verse, a translation from the " Chan- 
sons de Guzla," echoes of European travel, songs, 
and sonnets. We reproduce the irregular sonnet 
called " An Aspiration." 

" Peak piled on peak, like dim cathedral spires, 

Prick the light lace-work of the amber sky. 

On the green slopes weird, twisted shadows lie, 
Cast, dark and writhing, from the sun's fierce fires. 
Upward we strain our gaze, the soul aspires 

Unto those heights I Oh, but for wings to fly, 
To mount and mount with zeal that never tires 

To burst Earth's clod and live, though we should die. 

" To reach the vast Beyond ah, that Beyond, 
Which only once was bared to mortal eyes 

On Pisgah's mount ! To knit the unseen bond, 
That twixt the Infinite and Finite lies ! 

The pent soul struggles, and the heart grows fond, 
Whilst dimmer through our tears, the dim peaks rise." 

It is a pity that so unpardonable a license of form 
should mar what is otherwise an excellent sonnet. 
A lack of technical finish, we should add, is fre- 
quently to be observed in Miss Massey's poems. 

Our final word shall be given to the sheaf of un- 
pretentious verses called " Blue and Gold." They 
are hardly more than the recreations of a few idle

No longer miscall him when all has been said,

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

A new study of In his volume entitled "Man and 
the capabilities of Woman," Mr. Havelock Ellis, the 
man versus woman. e( jitor of the " Contemporary Science 
Series" (Scribner) in which the book appears, pre- 
sents data resulting from a dozen years' reading in 
sociological and anthropological literature. The au- 
thor has tried to gather and to present clearly our 
actual knowledge regarding the secondary sexual 
characters in the human species. The work is a 
timely contribution. Just at this time it is com- 
monly asserted that woman is capable of undertak- 
ing and accomplishing almost anything and every- 
thing that man can do. The idea is necessarily 
erroneous. Inherent differences due to sex are 
present in the whole of human life. Woman can 
never do man's work ; man can never do the work 
of woman. Each sex is adapted to a particular 
sphere of activity. This is not to assert that woman 
is man's inferior, either wholly or in most respects. 
But man and woman are necessarily unlike. The 
male is everywhere militant, active ; the female is 
everywhere industrial, passive. This fundamental 
distinction exists not only in humanity ; it goes 
throughout the animal and vegetable series until 
one gets very far down. No number of social ex- 
periments or emancipations will ever do away with 
it. Militancy demands the harmonious combination 
of certain characteristics : industrialism demands 
an equally happy combination of other characteris- 
tics. Neither is superior, neither inferior ; for race 
perpetuation and progress, both must be present, 
and both well characterized. To study these com- 
binations of qualities is a legitimate task in science. 
In his book Mr. Ellis breaks ground in this direc- 
tion. Anatomical, physiological, psychical com- 
parisons are made. Too little definite work has 
been done by original investigators for the book to 
give much of final conclusion. But it is an excel- 
lent compilation of present knowledge, and points 
out hopeful lines for future work. Mr. Ellis him-

self appears to conclude that women are nearer like 
children than like men ; that women are not unde- 
veloped men ; and that the child represents a higher 
degree of evolution than the adult. He appears 
also to expect a gradual approximation between the 
sexes, in which man may go further to reach the 
common ground than will woman. While not very 
fully agreeing with the author's deductions, we can 
heartily commend the book to thoughtful readers. 

That stanch Tory and amusing quid- 
mine, Mr. G. W. Smalley, signalizes 
his return to democracy and his na- 
tive heath by reprinting in book form a number of 
his London letters to the New York " Tribune," 
under the title " Studies of Men " (Harper). The 
papers are all chatty and readable, and filled with 
a certain unconscious humor for which the writer is 
noted. Thackeray should have known Mr. Smalley. 
The " Studies " are largely concerned with the no- 
bility and gentry, with whom the author seems to 
have been on almost as good terms as " Mrs. Jar- 
ley "; and the name of that eminent layer of corner- 
stones and glass of fashion, the Prince of Wales, 
crops up with agreeable frequency. Literary and 
political lights are not neglected, there being some 
very good papers, in the journalistic way, on Ten- 
nyson, Professor Jowett, Mrs. Ward, Mr. Parnell, 
Mr. Balfour, and others. One of the best of them 
is " A Visit to Prince Bismarck," reprinted from 
the " Fortnightly Review." Mr. Smalley tells a 
story of Lord Granville, then Foreign Minister, 
which he thinks very characteristic of him, and 
which we quote as very characteristic of Mr. Smal- 
ley. Lady Granville was giving a party at the 
Foreign Office, and host and hostess were receiving 
their guests on the landing of the great staircase. 
It was a notably grand affair. Mr. Smalley was 
there, and the Prince and Princess of Wales were 
momentarily expected. At this solemn juncture 
were announced " let us say Mr. and Mrs. Jones 
two very humble units in the brilliant procession 
which was advancing up the staircase. In another 
country than England it would hardly be under- 
stood, but here a guest not known to the Foreign 
Minister or his wife may easily enough pass both of 
them in the crush without recognition. Lord Gran- 
ville knew Mr. Jones, and shook hands with him. 
Mrs. Jones, with a dozen other ladies equally unre- 
marked, was passing on. The first notes of ' God 
Save the Queen,' proclaiming the approach of the 
royalties, were heard just then. Lord Granville 
heard them, but he stopped Mr. Jones, with that 
leisurely manner which he had in such perfection, 
and said : ' Pray introduce me to Mrs. Jones before 
you go up.' And he found time to murmur a polite 
greeting in Mrs. Jones's ear, while the music swelled 
and the Prince and Princess drew near ; and he 
reached the hall to receive them, with an infinitesi- 
mal fraction of a second to spare." Of such small 
phenomena Mr. Smalley is the keenest of observers 
and most unctuous of chroniclers.

THE DIAL 



121 



A hopeful view Mr - Arthur Henry Jones is not only 
of the future of the author of successful plays, such as 
English drama. u The Middleman," " The Tempter," 
etc., but he is also an agreeable writer on subjects 
pertaining to the dramatic art. His lectures and 
essays of the last ten years have covered nearly 
every phase of the dramatic situation in England ; 
and these he has now published in a volume called 
" The Renascence of the English Drama " (Mac- 
inilla.ii). At a time when so much is said and 
written of the hopelessness of the dramatic outlook, 
it is pleasing to find one well-informed writer tak- 
ing a cheerful view of the case. Mr. Jones pro- 
nounces the present a very critical period in the 
history of the English drama, the two most recent 
schools having perished because they failed to fur- 
nish any satisfaction to the artistic sense, and sup- 
plied only amusement. But in the last few years an 
improvement in public taste begins to be manifested ; 
audiences have become educated at least up to the 
point where they can detect artificiality and insin- 
cerity in plays. He has hopes for the foundation 
of a school of modern English drama, for a school 
of plays of serious intention, plays that implicitly 
assert the value and dignity of human life, that deal 
with its great passions and great aims, and show 
that it is full of meaning and of moment. Another 
interesting feature of the book is Mr. Jones's con- 
tention that the chief tests of a good play are " lit- 
erature and character-painting." The test of a good 
play, we are usually told, is, "How will it act?" 
Our author grants only that this is the test of a 
popular play ; that the test of a really good play is, 
" Can it be read as well as acted ? " Mere inge- 
nuity of situation, dramatic surprises, and complica- 
tions of a story, are at bottom worthless unless they 
illustrate and develop human character ; and every 
dramatic work of lasting value will stand the test 
as literature and as character-painting, though it 
may not stand any other test. The author has a 
great admiration for Matthew Arnold, as is ap- 
parent not only by his direct tributes occasionally, 
but by his imitations, probably unconscious, of Ar- 
nold's literary style. There is, in both, the same 
fondness for reiteration of a happy phrase (for ex- 
ample, the "billy-cock-hat criticism"), the same 
tendency to humor of a somewhat frisky order, the 
same type of allusions, as well as the same high 
qualities of directness, simplicity, and insight. 

The second volume of " Moods " (" a 
childish'" Moods." Journal Intime, wherein the Artist 

and the Author pleaseth himself ") 
is upon us before we have noticed the first. We 
hasten, therefore, with a slight remark on the sec- 
ond, in order that the third may not find us still 
among those who are unimpressed by this manifesto 
of the youth of the day. Certain things about this 
publication will be remarked by everyone : we need 
merely note that such an artistic publication is 
always, in a general way, a good thing, as showing 
some movement of ideas ; that this particular one 



is an imitation of the " Yellow Book "; that it is 
quite amateurish, especially in its pictures ; that the 
Jenson Press ("Makers of Unique Volumes") is 
kept rather too prominently before the reader ; and 
that it must be pleasant for the young artists of this 
country to have some city of refuge from those 
cold encouragers of youthful genius, the " Century 
Magazine " et aliis. Having said so much, the 
whole contents of kk Moods " may well enough pass 
without special comment, and one or two general 
remarks on the publication will be sufficient for 
practical purposes. The first is that, while there 
are several things that one may easily acknowledge 
to be quite clever, there is nothing from cover to 
cover ( in Volume Two) that absolutely compels ad- 
miration. This is a pity ; a few such things give 
sufficient reason for a publication of this kind. One 
would think that in such a movement of generous- 
hearted young men and women, there would surely 
be something which would make one say, " That 's 
the real thing; that fellow has the right stuff in 
him ; there 's a lot of rubbish about it, but it 's a 
thing you have to acknowledge, whether you like it 
or not." But no such genuine feeling has disturbed 
the mind of any reader of " Moods." There's not a 
spark of real life. The second thing to observe is 
that there is a tone of indelicacy and immodesty in 
the book which is unbecoming. We use these mild 
words, because stronger ones would seem to indicate a 
certain virility or manliness which is absent. The pub- 
lication is by no means wholly improper ; but about 
half of the young men of the day have written things 
which their mothers will be pained to read. Mr. 
Owen Wister and Mr. Walter Blackburn Harte give 
rather slight assistance in counterbalancing the child- 
ishness of the rest, but they have much to contend 
with. We have then, on the whole, a book without 
anything of commanding excellence, and with a 
great deal that really demands the contempt that 
such ventures as " Moods " are too apt to receive. 

Volume II. of a useful series of studies 
A new life of of p ublic Men of To-day " ( Warne) 

tneC/nnese Vweroy. . T < FT- TT i ?> i 

is a " Life of Li Hungchang, by 
Professor Robert K. Douglas. Considering the ob- 
vious difficulties in the way of the biographer of a 
Chinese statesman, the author has done his work re- 
markably well, tracing intelligibly the military and 
diplomatic career of the Viceroy from his first active 
services at the time of the T'aip'ing Rebellion, down 
to the late ruffianly assault upon him in the streets 
of Shimonoseki. With many admirable qualities, 
and even a certain sense of the superiority of West- 
ern nations in point of practical science and the me- 
chanical arts, Li has never been able to shake off 
the chains of the fatal conservatism which have 
bound his countrymen for ages. The evidence of his 
senses has forced upon him the unwelcome fact that 
in the appliances of industry and warfare the " bar- 
barians " of the West and their facile imitators in 
Japan have far outstripped his countrymen ; but 
never for an instant has been shaken his implicit

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



belief in " the ineffable wisdom of the founders of 
Chinese polity, or in the superiority of the civiliza- 
tion of China over that possessed by any other na- 
tion on the face of the earth." Nevertheless, Li 
Hungchang has rendered his country signal ser- 
vices. It is a pity that his long and heretofore rel- 
atively useful career should close with a series of 
national disasters due to his fatal inability to read 
aright the drift of Japanese policy in Korea. With 
China and Japan in accord, and Korea strength- 
ened and developed into an effective " buffer " state, 
Russian advance to the southward would receive a 
serious check ; and it is plainly the Russian Drang 
nach Suden that furnishes the key to Japan's ac- 
tivity in the " Hermit State." Heinrich Heine once 
predicted that the time would come when all Eu- 
rope would "smell of Russian leather." The spirit 
of the prediction, or the thought that inspired it, has 
long pervaded the diplomacy of the Orient ; and 
that so astute a man as Li, filled moreover with a 
wholesome dread of the " grasping policy of Rus- 
sia," should have failed to join hands with Japan 
in the Korean matter, is surprising enough. The 
volume contains portraits of Li Hungchang and of 
Vice-Admiral Ito. 



Dr. G. F. Browne's Off the Mill " 

A collection of /. ,> \ ,. a , 

Alpine sketches. (Macmillan) is chiefly made up of 
papers on Alpine subjects, which first 
appeared some thirty years ago in various periodicals. 
These productions will be of some interest to the 
present generation of Alpine climbers as reflecting 
the conditions that faced the amateur mountaineer 
before Einspdnners and the like valetudinary helps 
had made the ascent of Mont Blanc comparatively 
a rather commonplace, not to say cockney, affair. 
Your genuine mountaineer nowadays, men like 
Messrs. Con way and Whymper, are content with 
nothing short of the Andes and the Himalayas. Dr. 
Browne's Alpine sketches, we learn, were originally 
printed with illustrations, " the earliest, or almost 
the earliest, of Mr. Du Maurier's work "; and these 
chefs-d'oeuvre have, we regret to say, been omitted 
from the reprint on the singular plea that "the 
great change which has taken place in the ladies' 
dress would cause the illustrations to seem unreal." 
The creator of " Trilby " is not just the man, per- 
haps, to do justice to the Alps ; but we should very 
much like to see what he would make of them. 
Other papers in the volume are : " A Night with a 
Salmon," " The Engadine," " Collecting Ancestors," 
" Archaeological Frauds in Palestine " (a very good 
one), " Pontresina," etc. 

Professor F. M. Warren's " History 
Lei. of the Novel Previous to the Seven- 
teenth Century " (Holt) is a useful 
contribution to literary history, although it is a 
somewhat discursive production, and not as well 
written as it ought to be. The idea of the book was 
suggested by KOrting's "History of the French 
Novel in the Seventeenth Century," and the method 



of study derived from Rohde's "History of the 
Greek Novel." After an introductory chapter, which 
aims chiefly at distinguishing between the terms 
" story," " romance," and " novel," the author dis- 
cusses in successive chapters the Greek novel, the 
romance of chivalry, the Italian and Spanish pas- 
toral, and the Spanish picaresque novel. Lengthy 
analyses are given of such works as the " Amadis 
of Gaul," the " Palmerin of England," the " Ar- 
cadia " of Sannazaro, the " Diana " of Montemayor, 
and the " Lazarillo de Tonnes." The author de- 
serves much credit for the patience with which he 
has read and summarized these wearisome produc- 
tions, and for the measure of success with which he 
has traced the ancestry of the typical forms of mod- 
ern fiction. For a large part of the ground covered 
by this work, we had, previous to its appearance, 
nothing better than Dunlop in English ; and Dun- 
lop, viewed in the light of modern criticism, leaves 
much to be desired. 



Readings from 
old English 
dramatists. 



Two volumes of " Readings from 
the Old English Dramatists" (Lee 
& Shepard) have been compiled by 
Mrs. Erving Winslow, the selections being con- 
nected and introduced by some discussion of the 
successive dramatic periods thus represented. Be- 
ginning with a chapter called " Miracle to Masque," 
the subject is carried through the " Comedy of the 
Eighteenth Century." The compiler has shown 
much skill and taste, together with occasional orig- 
inality. The chapter on " Minor Elizabethan Dram- 
atists " is noteworthy because it is an appreciative 
tribute to a class of men that commonly have scant 
justice done them. The readings here are from 
Ben Jonson's " Every Man in his Humour," from 
Dekker's " Shoemaker's Holiday," and Heywood's 
" A Woman Killed with Kindness." Speaking of 
the first appearance on the stage of women actors, 
in place of the boys who had previously played the 
women's parts, the author makes this striking ob- 
servation : " Here is a mystery, with all the ad- 
vantages offered to the modern dramatist by the 
greatest actresses, it is but rarely that he moulds 
a perfect woman for the stage ; while the ancient 
poets were inspired by these beardless youths to 
some of their most delicate productions, and sex 
seems never to have been forgotten." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We take pleasure in calling attention to the excep- 
tionally neat and well-edited German texts that have 
recently been published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
They include Schiller's " Jungfrau von Orleans," edited 
by Mr. A. B. Nichols; ScheffePs " Trompeter von Sak- 
kingen," edited by Miss Mary A. Frost; a volume of 
" German Prose and Poetry for Early Reading," edited 
by Mr. T. B. Bronson; and a selection of "Deutsche 
Gedichte," edited by Dr. Camillo von Klenze. Mr. 
Bronson's volume includes Hauff's " Karawane " and 
many shorter pieces; Dr. von Klenze's book is devoted 



1895.]

to " characteristic German literary ballads and lyrics 
since the dawn of the classical period." 

Professor B. A. Hinsdale's work on " The American 
Government, National and State " (Werner) was first 
published four years ago, and now reappears in a re- 
vised edition, printed entirely from new plates, and 
embodying many alterations and improvements. The 
work must be regarded as one of the best of our college 
text-books, and as an invaluable aid to teachers of the 
subject in our lower schools. Compactness, careful 
arrangement of matter, and a plain forcible style, all 
commend the book to both teacher and student. The 
treatment is throughout historical, and the State govern- 
ments get their due share of attention. 

The constant and increasing demand for Dr. Mas- 
pero's " Manual of Egyptian Archaeology " has caused 
the publishers (Putnam) to issue a new edition " in as 
light and portable a form as possible." This new edi- 
tion has been revised and enlarged by the author him- 
self, and made more useful than ever to the traveller in 
Egypt, or to the student at home, as a work of refer- 
ence. The text of the translation is that made by 
the late Amelia B. Edwards, subject, of course, to the 
modifications that have been found necessary to bring 
the work to date. There are over three hundred illus- 
trations. 

The excellent new English edition of Balzac (Dent- 
Macmillan), the initial volume of which was noticed in 
our last issue, has been extended by two more volumes 
" The Chouans," translated by Miss Ellen Marriage, 
and " At the Sign of the Cat and Racket," translated 
by Miss Clara Bell, and supplied with a preface by Mr. 
George Saintsbury. The new edition of Defoe, edited 
by Mr. George A. Aitken and illustrated by Mr. J. B. 
Yeats, and bearing also the Dent-Macmillan imprint, 
reaches its ninth volume in " A Journal of the Plague 
Year." It is a pleasure to commend such beautiful 
books as are contained in both these sets. 

Mr. A. P. Gage's " Elements of Physics " has been 
for the past dozen years the best American book of its 
kind accessible for high school use. It is now supple- 
mented (we can hardly say replaced) by the more com- 
prehensive and up-to-date " Principles of Physics " 
(Ginn), which exemplifies the same admirable methods 
of presentation as the earlier work, and offers material 
enough for both high school and college courses. It is 
a book of between six and seven hundred pages, with 
all sorts of helpful illustrations in abundance. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" A Pair of Blue Eyes " has just been added by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers to their handsome library 
edition of the novels of Mr. Thomas Hardy. 

The Dent-Lippincott imprint is borne by the title- 
page of a new and revised edition of Mrs. Alfred Bald- 
win's " The Story of a Marriage." 

A pleasant surprise for the Fall Season is announced 

by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co a new volume of 

poems by Lowell, with a new portrait as frontispiece. 

Notwithstanding the almost innumerable editions of 
De Amicis' " Cuore," a new one, illustrated, is nearly 
ready for publication by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

The International Literary and Artistic Association 
will hold its seventeenth congress at Dresden from Sep- 



tember 21 to 28, under the patronage of the King of 
Saxony. 

Mrs. Humphry Ward's new novel, " Sir George Tres- 
sady," upon which she has been at work for the past 
two years, will appear as a serial in " The Century," 
beginning with November. 

The first story by Michael Field to appear in an 
American periodical is begun in the September " Atlan- 
tic " with the title of " Tiger Lilies." Is not this, by 
the way, the title of Sidney Lanier's earliest novel ? 

A new edition of Shakespeare's plays, intended espe- 
cially for high school and college classes, will be begun 
at once by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. There are sev- 
eral editors, and the text is based on that of the Globe 
edition. 

It is reported, from London, that Li Hung Chang, 
the Chinese Viceroy, desires to spend next winter in the 
United States. A book of " impressions " by him dur- 
ing his sojourn here would be an interesting literary 
announcement. 

The " Literary World " of Bostqn has changed editors, 
Mr. N. P. Gilman retiring to become a professor of 
sociology in the Meadville Theological School, and the 
Rev. Edward Abbott, who was editor of the paper for 
about twelve years previous to 1889, resuming his old 
position. 

The committee of the Incorporated Society of Au- 
thors (London) have adopted a resolution conveying to 
Mr. G. H. Putnam " their recognition and appreciation 
of the services he has rendered to the cause of interna- 
tional copyright, in conjunction with Mr. R. Under- 
wood Johnson and the American committee." 

The recent death of the artist Hovenden, in Phila- 
delphia, has inspired a movement, on the part of the 
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, for a memorial 
exhibition of his works, together with those of two other 
Philadelphia artists also lately deceased, P. F. Roth- 
ermel and I. L. Williams. The Academy would be glad 
to hear from owners of pictures by these artists, as it 
is desired to make the exhibit a full and representative 
one. The address is Philadelphia. 

The following monographs have just appeared in the 
" Science Series " of the " Bulletin of the University of 
Wisconsin " : " On the Quartz Keratophyre and Asso- 
ciated Rocks of the North Range of the Baraboo Bluffs," 
by Mr. Samuel Weidman; "Studies in Spherical and 
Practical Astronomy," by Mr. George C. Comstock; 
" A Contribution to the Mineralogy of Wisconsin," by 
Mr. W. H. Hobbs; and "An Experimental Study of 
Field Methods Which Will Insure to Stadia Measure- 
ments Greater Accuracy," by Mr. Leonard S. Smith. 

A gap is left in the ranks of the publishing fraternity 
of America by the death of H. O. Houghton, head of 
the house of Houghton, Mifflin & Co., which occurred 
suddenly at his home in North Andover, Mass., August 
25, at the age of seventy years. Mr. Houghton began 
life as a printer, and after building up one of the fore- 
most printing houses of America, the " Riverside Press," 
he entered the publishing field as a member of the firm 
of Kurd & Houghton. A few years later he acquired an 
interest, with J. R. Osgood, in the firm which succeeded 
the historic houses of Ticknor & Fields, and Fields, Os- 
good & Co., and which afterwards, on Mr. Osgood's re- 
tirement, became the house of Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
It is a house which possesses the highest traditions and 
associations in American literature; and these were 
worthily maintained under Mr. Houghton's regime.

WILSON'S WORKS, 



BEING 

Lectures Upon Jurisprudence and the Political Science, 

By JAMES WILSON, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, delivered in the Pennsylvania 
University Law College, in 1790-91, with Introduction and Notes, by JAMES DE WITT ANDREWS, Professor 
of Law in Northwestern University College of Law, Chicago, constitute just such an introduction to the study 
of our institutions as enables one to see the transition of old principles from other systems to our jurisprudence. 
This is the first book after the adoption of the Constitution explaining the underlying principles of that 
instrument. 

.lames Wilson is recognized as the most learned of the lawyers who were members of the Convention of 1787. 
This work will be especially desirable as an introduction to the study of jurisprudence in universities and col- 
leges. The notes, while not voluminous, give the key to the present application and development of the principles 
elucidated in the text. 

Two Volumes. Will be ready in October.

Hill Caves of Yucatan. 

By HENRY C. MERCER. Illustrated. 8vo. Cloth, $1.50. 
This is a clever and interesting account of the Corwith Expedition of 
the University of Pennsylvania in Yucatan, for the exploration of 
human culture layers in the mountain caverns, and of proving the 
antiquity and character of the Maya civilization in the peninsula. The 
work is profusely illustrated by photographs of caves and drawings of 
cavern refuse exposed in the explorations. 

Hans Breitmann in Germany. 

By CHARLES GODFREY LELAND. 12mo. Ornamental title 
and cover, $1.25. Published in connection with T. Fisher 
Unwin, of London. 
Mr. Leland has been seized with a renewal of the old inspiration ; 

hence this further instalment of the excellent Dog-English of Hans. 

The old book is a classic : all the new book wants is time to become so. 



Lippincott's Gazetteer of the World. 

Revised Edition of 1895. With Tables of Latest Census Re- 
turns. One volume. 8vo. Sheep. $12.00 ; half Turkey, 
$15.00 ; half Russia, $15.00. Two volumes. Sheep, $15.00 ; 
half Russia or half Turkey, $18.00. With Patent Index, 
75 cents additional. 

It is scarcely necessary to say that in the present edition all the char- 
acteristic excellences of former issues have been retained, but in addi- 
tion to these features many improvements such as are necessary to the 
perfection of a work of reference on a progressive science, like the 
science of geography, will be found embraced therein. It is confidently 
believed that the recent revisions of the work and the many improve- 
ments now first embraced in the volume will render this issue of 1895 a 
worthy successor to preceding editions.

M.A., author of "Prince Bismarck: an Historical Bio- 
graphy," etc. With portrait. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00. 
The author's previous volume bears witness to his thorough knowl- 
edge of the life and character of the greatest modern diplomat. In this 
work, however, the author deals with the more intimate side of Bis- 
marck's character ; and his eccentricities, amusing chapters in his life, 
and witty sayings are fully dealt with.

A Northern Seasonal. Part I., Spring, 1895. 4to. Full 
leather, stamped, $2.00. Part II., Autumn, 1895. 4to. Full 
leather, stamped, $2.00. 

As the " Yellow Book " has been the exponent of the Decadent 
School in literature and art, so does this beautiful quarterly represent 
the new Scottish School, which now has the latest attention of the 
public both here and abroad. The literature is most attractive, and 
the revival of Celtic ornament and design is one of the features of 
the book. "The Evergreen" will be printed on rough paper, by 
Messrs. Constable, of Edinburgh, with colored cover, fashioned in 
leather, by C. H. Mackie. The Book of Summer will appear in May, 
1896, and the Book of Winter in November, 1896.

Dr. Savidge has made a comprehensive picture of the military and 
diplomatic phases of the Franco-Prussian War, including the battle of 
Sedan, the Siege and Commune of Paris, and has woven them into a 
romance which throws into prominence not only the figures but the 
actual authenticated utterances of Bismark, Moltke, William, Napoleon 
III., Eugenie, Favre, Thiers, Gambetta, MacMahon, Bazaine, Louise 
Michel, and the Americans Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, and Washington.

BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 

If we may judge from the announcements 
of new books made by the publishers for the 
season just opening, the trade of the bookman 
is anticipating its full share in the revival of 
prosperity that seems to be close at hand, if it 
has not already begun. Following our usual 
custom, we print in this mid-September issue 
of THE DIAL a classified list of the announce- 
ments already made by American publishers, 
and, although there are doubtless many more 
to come during the next few weeks, the list as 
it now stands is considerably more extensive 
than any that we have previously had occasion 
to present. The object of the present article 
is to single out from the multitude of books 
already definitely promised a few of those that 
are likely to attract the most widespread atten- 
tion and find greatest favor with book-lovers. 

The most important work of the year, at 
least from the strictly literary point of view, 
will be the long-deferred collection of Matthew 
Arnold's letters, edited by Mr. George Russell. 
Nothing promised us of late years has been so 
impatiently awaited as this collection, and we 
hail with delight the prospect of its early ap- 
pearance. In the same category come three 
other collections of letters, all soon to be pub- 
lished : the " Vailima " letters of Robert Louis 
Stevenson, the letters of Edward FitzGerald 
to Fanny Kemble, and the " Family Letters " 
of Dante Rossetti, edited by his brother, Mr. 
W. M. Rossetti. Here, indeed, are four books 
that will be read with avidity by all lovers of 
literature. Literature and literary history are 
also to be represented by " Anima Poeta3," a 
series of hitherto unpublished passages from 
the note-books of Coleridge ; "An Introduc- 
tory to the Study of Literary Criticism," by 
Professor C. M. Gayley ; a work on " Modern 
German Literature," by Dr. B. W. Wells ; 
" Books and Their Makers during the Middle 
Ages," by Mr. George Haven Putnam ; " The 
Literary History of the American Revolution," 
by Professor Moses Coit Tyler ; a volume of 
" Miscellaneous Studies," by Walter Pater ; and 
the long-promised " Victorian Anthology " of 
Mr. Stedman, a work which will, we doubt not, 
surpass in taste, judgment, and knowledge all 



134 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



previous attempts to represent by a series of se- 
lections English poetry of the last half-century. 

Of new literature, in the narrower sense, it 
seems that we shall have our full share. Vol- 
umes of poetry by Thoreau, Mrs. Stoddard, 
Mr. Frederick Tennyson, James Russell Low- 
ell, Mr. Francis Thompson, Mr. William Dean 
Howells, Christina Rossetti, and Mrs. Marriott 
Watson, are a few of the many gifts to be 
brought us from the kingdom of song. We 
suppose that " The Wood beyond the World," 
by Mr. William Morris, must be described as 
fiction, although it is sure to have more of the 
characteristics of poetry than many a volume 
of rhymed and rhythmical utterance. A few 
titles of forthcoming novels are the following : 
" The Stark Munro Letters," by Dr. A. Conan 
Doyle ; " Clarence " and " In a Hollow of the 
Hills," both by Mr. Bret Harte ; " The Mys- 
tery of Witch-Face Mountain," by Miss Mary 
N. Murfree ; "A Gentleman Vagabond," by 
Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith ; " The Amazing 
Marriage," by Mr. George Meredith ; " The 
Second Jungle Book," by Mr. Rudyard Kip- 
ling ; " Joan Haste," by Mr. H. Rider Hag- 
gard ; " Casa Braccio," by Mr. F. M. Craw- 
ford ; " The Red Cockade?' by Mr. Stanley J. 
Weyman ; " The Day of Their Wedding," by 
Mr. W. D. Howells ; His Father's Son," by 
Professor Brander Matthews ; and "A Three- 
Stranded Yarn," by Mr. W. Clark Russell. 

Among biographical works, the most inter- 
esting to Americans will be the memoir of Fran- 
cis Parkman, by Mr. C. H. Farnham ; the 
" Recollections of Abraham Lincoln," by Mr. 
Ward H. Lamon ; and the story of Townsend 
Harris, our first envoy to Japan, by Dr. W. E. 
Griffis. A " Life of Gustave Flaubert," by Mr. 
J. C. Tarver, is an extremely interesting an- 
nouncement, and hardly less interesting are the 
promised life of Hans Christian Andersen, by 
Mr. R. Nisbet Bain ; of W. H. Seward (in the 
" American Statesmen " series), by Mr. T. K. 
Lothrop ; of Agassiz, by M. Jules Marcou ; of 
Cardinal Manning, by Mr. E. S. Purcell ; and 
of Cardinal Wiseman, by Mr. Wilfred Ward. 
Mr. F. Marion Crawford's book on " Constan- 
tinople " is sure to be among the most popular 
works of travel and description published dur- 
ing the year, and many readers will also be 
found for " Advance, Japan ! " by Mr. J. Mor- 
ris ; and for the first volume of Mr. A. H. 
Keane's great work on Africa. One of th? most 
ambitious of recent undertakings in the liter- 
ature of art is the great " Cyclopedia of Art 
and Architecture in Italy, Greece, and the Le- 



vant," edited by Mr. W. P. P. Longfellow. 
Other important art-works are Sig. Cattaneo's 
" Architecture in Italy from the Sixth to the 
Eleventh Century "; " Lectures on Art," by 
Mr. John La Farge ; and " The Art of Velas- 
quez," by Mr. R. A. M. Stevenson. Art the- 
ory and criticism will be exemplified by Mr. 
George L. Raymond's "Painting, Sculpture, 
and Architecture as Representative Arts," Mr. 
Frank P. Stearns's " The Midsummer of Italian 
Art," and three essays, published in separate 
illustrated volumes, by the late P. G. Hamerton. 
In the department of political and social science 
we may mention Dr. Albert Shaw's " Munici- 
pal Government in Continental Europe," " The 
Principles of Sociology," by Professor F. H. 
Giddings ; " Lectures on Political Science " 
and " The Growth of British Policy," both by 
the late Sir John Seeley ; " The Science of 
Finance," by Professor Henry C. Adams ; 
" Money and Banking," by Mr. Horace White ; 
and a work on " The Poor of Great Cities," 
by various hands. In religious history, the 
most important announcements seem to be the 
lectures of Professor Rhys-Davids on " Bud- 
dhism," and the popular papers of Professor 
C. H. Cornill on The Prophets of Israel." 
Finally, we may include in this category of the 
works of serious scholarship the promised 
translation, from the Greek of Dr. Crestos 
Tsountas, of his great work on " The Mycen- 
a?an Civilization," Professor J. P. Mahaffy's 
" History of the Ptolemies," and volumes by 
the late E. A. Freeman upon Western Europe 
in the fifth and eighth centuries. 

Three classes of books yet remain to be 
scanned the special holiday publications, the 
continuation of works already in part before the 
public, and the reprints of standard literature. 
In the first of these classes, the announcements 
now made cover but a small proportion of what 
may be expected as the Christmas season draws 
near. We may mention here the holiday edi- 
tions of Mr. Dobson's poems, of Reade's

fifth (and last) volume of Renan's " History

George J. Romanes ; " A Natural History of 
Plants," by Professor Kerner von Marilaun ; and 
" A Literary History of the English People," 
by Mr. J. J. Jusserand. As for the promised 
reprints, they are legion ; and, as they usually 
mean handier or more tasteful editions than we

ate new material, they are cordially welcome. 
What could be more satisfactory, for example, 
than a complete Browning, in a single volume ? 
And that is just what is promised us, by a house 
whose name is a guarantee that we shall not 
be disappointed in the mechanical features of 
the book. A complete one -volume Holmes 
(that is, the poetry) is promised us by the same 
house. A five-volume edition of Mrs. Jame- 
son's works on art will supply an obvious want, 
for these books hold their own, although recent 
scholarship has left them less adequate than 
they once were. The new Poe, edited by Mr. 
Stedman and Professor Woodberry, will be on 
the market complete at a very early date. As 
for new editions of Stevenson, they are so nu- 
merous that we have not space even to name 
them all. In old-fashioned fiction, we shall 
have an eight-volume edition of Gait's novels, 
and doubtless many other reprints of like char- 
acter. During the coming months, of course, 
the works above mentioned, together with many 
others, will receive characterization and criti- 



cal treatment, at the hands of the most compe- 
tent American authorities, in the pages of THE

as it has been for the past fifteen years, to pro- 
vide the prospective buyer and reader of the 
new books with impartial and trustworthy guid- 
ance in his selection of the volumes that he 
may wish to add to his shelves. 



MODERN DANISH LITERATURE, AND 
ITS FOREMOST REPRESENTATIVE. 



For a considerable part of the present century, 
Denmark was the country of Romanticism. There 
are those who would say that such is still the case. 
Names from that period could be mentioned which, 
if known, would shine among the world's best ; but 
it was their fate to write in a language familiar to 
but a small fraction of the European population. 
After the war of 1864, the disrupted and discour- 
aged country was most concerned with healing its 
own wounds. The patriotism which has always 
distinguished the Danish nation naturally favored, 
after such disappointment, an absorption in the past 
which had somewhat the character of an after- 
growth of Romanticism. The predilection for sub- 
jects of historical and legendary character, with a 
deep feeling for their value because they were na- 
tional and Danish, and the enthusiasm for the peas- 
ant character, with its simple unaffected ways, as 
the core and centre of a national regeneration, have 
left a deep impression on the literature and life of 
this period. 

The great change, however, which institutions and 
ideas underwent all over Europe after the Franco- 
German war, together with the establishment of the 
German Empire, has given rise in Denmark to a 
school of distinctly modern writers. The hegemony 
of the German Empire on the continent made clear 
to intelligent patriots the utter hopelessness of any 
dreams of restitution of that part of the conquered 
provinces which the Danes claimed as theirs in ac- 
cordance with the sentiment of nationality. When 
the thought of revenge was recognized to be vain, 
the greater part of the population decided to accept 
the situation as it was, and to make the most of it 
from a standpoint of absolute neutrality ; to content 
themselves with peaceful efforts in the arenas of 
science, literature, and art, as well as in commer- 
cial enterprise and progress. In such conditions 
the modern literary school has firmly established 
itself, and has gained possession of the Parnassus 
of Danish literature. The present craze for military 
equipment, which ruins the Danish treasury and im- 
perils its future, brought about as it is by a power- 
ful but unpopular faction which has the sympathy 
of the crown, but has for years governed against the 
expressed will of the nation at large, is viewed with 
no little grief and indignation by all sensible peo-

pie. The actual if not recognized leader of this 
opposition party has been, and is, Herr Georg 
Brandes, renowned not less for his eminence as a 
writer and critic than for his wonderful versatility 
and truly cosmopolitan interests. The remark of 
M. Zola, that Denmark seemed like a small animal 
with big feelers stretched toward the general cur- 
rent of European life to find out what was going 
on, is no inadequate simile. And the one who really 
established such a communication between the life 
in the great centres of culture outside and the intel- 
lectual circles of his own fatherland, is undoubtedly 
Herr Brandes. Such a thing is usually undertaken 
for private benefit only ; but Herr Brandes has had 
greater and wider aims than personal pleasure or 
fame. Always ready to accept and utilize new 
impulses, never corrupted or crushed in the service 
of the ideas he has advocated through more than a 
generation, Herr Brandes seems imbued with the 
inexhaustible energy of the wonderful Semitic race 
to which he belongs. It is, moreover, a character- 
istic feature of his activity that hardly anything he 
writes or says fails to arouse antagonism among 
his countrymen, and to call out an assault upon his 
veracity, knowledge, understanding, judgment, and 
what not. This in turn rouses his friends and fol- 
lowers to rush to his defence. Thus, amidst the 
dead calm of a government of the utmost reaction- 
ary and absolute tendencies, the spiritual atmos- 
phere at least is frequently renewed, and a steady cur- 
rent of controversy, with an occasional whirlwind, 
keeps things on the move and prevents stagnation. 

It is no wonder that a writer with such ideal aims 
and of so firm a fibre should become the creator 
and chief supporter of a new school of thought and 
culture. That this school has, as its programme, 
sympathy with all modern literature, is only a 
necessary consequence. The aim of this school, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, has been to combat the 
supposition, sometimes expressed, that Denmark in 
its reduced circumstances has played out its part in 
the world's drama, and is on the point of losing its 
individuality, its character, and its rank among na- 
tions. This aim has been so successfully main- 
tained, that Danish art and literature at least stand 
worthily side by side with the strivings and achieve- 
ments of the general spiritual life of Europe. 

Among the host of younger and older authors of 
this new phalanx, the poet and painter Holger 
Drachmann is indisputably the most gifted, and at 
present we are glad to say the most popular. 
He is a painter of no small ability, and a writer of 
much force and originality in his various novels ; 
but by far the greatest manifestation of his genius 
and power is shown in his lyrical poetry, which 
unites a singular freshness of feeling with exquisite 
melody and perfection of form. 

It has been said that Herr Drachmann became 
a painter from love of the sea ; but when he saw 
that his pictures were dumb that they lacked the 
roar of the gale, the ripple of the waves, the sigh 
of the water on the shore, he began to paint with 



words, and in rhythms. In Herr Drachmann 's 
work, the love of the sea is the predominant chord, 
whether he writes songs, novels, or plays, for he 
has many strings in his lyre. In this respect one 
might think there existed some resemblance between 
Herr Drachmann and Mr. Swinburne. But this is 
not so ; the Greek character so prevalent in Mr. 
Swinburne's poetry is entirely lacking in Herr 
Drachmann's. Dreaminess is not his characteristic, 
nor is philosophy, nor pure harmony. Artistic love 
of light and color imbues his poetry with a special 
charm. The rhythm and rhymes flow from his pen 
as easily as from Mr. Swinburne's ; but his verse 
lacks the sombre tint and the peculiar redundancy 
of melody characteristic of the English poet. 

Herr Drachmann made his literary debut with a 
little work in prose, entitled " With Charcoal and 
Chalk "; and in 1872 his first volume of poems ap- 
peared. Little by little the poet became more pow- 
erful than the painter, and after some years the 
brush had wholly to give way to the pen. Since 
then, half a hundred volumes in prose and verse 
have appeared, and among them works that are a 
true ornament of Danish literature. The tendency 
in his works is certainly modern ; but Herr Drach- 
mann can be classed neither with the " naturalists " 
nor with the " symbolists." He has his own indi- 
vidual forte, which is at the same time thoroughly 
popular. He is much attracted by the fantastic, 
but by the fantastic in such measure and form as is 
possessed by the fairy story. His particular aim, 
especially in later years, has been to reach the heart 
of the common people, to draw nearer to them and 
draw them closer to him, in order to find thereby a 
broad field for an activity both encouraging and 
awakening, which he thinks is needed in order to 
rouse their slumbering powers and deadened energy. 
His life with the fishermen at Skagen, his travels 
and conversations, have opened his understanding to 
the struggles and the unostentatious bravery shown 
in the existence of the hundreds and thousands 
of men upon whose courage and resistance the ten- 
acity of a nation depend. Herr Drachmann is a pa- 
triot of the most exultant character. All through the 
earlier part of his productive period he was almost 
too turbulent in praise of his country and advocacy 
of its cause. In later years, however, the continued 
misgovernment, and the increasing lethargy of the 
people in allowing the ministry to continue their 
absolute ignoring of all constitutional rights, have 
made him more and more distrustful and hopeless 
concerning the future. Accordingly, in 1890, with 
the publication of his largest and weightiest novel, 
" Pledged," the poet made up the account between 
himself and his past. An attempt to establish in 
Copenhagen a place of public resort of a high in- 
tellectual grade, yet not of an " academic " charac- 
ter, receiving the ideas and movements of the time, 
and allowing artists and poets to bring their works 
directly to an unprejudiced public, hoping thereby 
to educate the masses, failed utterly. It is the re- 
sult of ideas cherished by Herr Drachmann, that

the " free theatre," on the plan of the Tlie&tre libre 
in Paris, enjoyed its brief existence. But his liter- 
ary-popular "cafe" had not even such fortune. 
Wearied of the hopeless project, which met no in- 
terest and support from the wealthy classes, Herr 
Drachmann left the country, and has since spent 
his time mostly in Germany the land from which 
he thinks Denmark has much to learn. His stay 
in Hamburg during the cholera epidemic, his cour- 
ageous and helpful conduct during that time, when 
even the inhabitants themselves lost hope and wished 
to desert the plague-stricken city, have been favor- 
ably commented upon in the German papers. His 
productivity as an author has lost nothing during 
his absence from home, and although his health is 
not strong, his friends and admirers may still hope 
to see much from his pen in years to come. 

To English readers, it may be of interest to 
know that Herr Drachmann has made himself 
known also as a brilliant translator of Byron's " Don 
Juan," a task not yet finished. Here the translator 
has done his brother poet a service such as few have 
been able to render. It is true of music that no- 
body can render a composer as well as one who is 
himself a composer ; and the same must be true of 
poetry. The masterly handling of the difficult ma- 
terial places this translation of Byron scarcely be- 
low the original. Whether Herr Drachmann him- 
self, and especially in some of his best lyrics, shall 
ever be satisfactorily translated into English, is a 
question time only can answer. Perhaps in his 
most genuine works he is as little translatable as is 
Dr. Ibsen, although some reproductions may be a 
pleasant exception. Of his works the following are 
probably the best known : " Songs by the Sea," 
" Venezia," " From the Frontier," " The Princess 
and Half the Kingdom," " Lars Kruse," " East o' 
the Sun and West o' the Moon," " The Daughter of 
the Waters," " Paul and Virginia of a Northern 
Zone," Once Upon a Time," " The Book of Songs," 
"Pledged," " Volund the Smith," "Renaissance." 

Herr Drachmann was born in 1846. It is hoped 
that he will remain for years to come the honor and 
joy of his country. M> WERGELAND . 



COMMUNICA TION. 



LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An interesting controversy is going on, in the col- 
umns of the literary magazines of Tokyo, on the ques- 
tion of the abolition of the Chinese idiographs in the 
written language. The weight of centuries of usage and 
of economy, through conciseness in the expression of 
ideas, is in favor of their retention. But they are so 
complex and so cumbrous, and require so much time 
for study in a curriculum tremendously overcrowded, 
that they are felt to be a great drag upon popular edu- 
cation. And especially do they seem to be entirely un- 
suited for the new career for which Japan is evidently 
destined. There is a strong feeling among thinking 



men that the Japanese language and Japanese literature 
cannot adapt themselves to modern thought and attain 
the possibilities of modern civilization with such incon- 
venient and unpractical modes of expressing and com- 
municating thought. It is argued, therefore, that a 
more simple and easy alphabet must be substituted for 
the prevalent mixture of Japanese characters and Chi- 
nese idiographs, if Japan wishes to maintain communi- 
cation with the world at large. 

But the reformers are thus far unable to agree upon 
a substitute. Some urge the adoption of Roman let- 
ters; others are in favor of using only the Japanese 
Kana; " while yet others propose modifications of the 
Kana so as to meet the requirements of transliterating 
foreign names." These last, who seem to be supported 
by a majority of the literary reformers, also recom- 
mend the mode of writing from left to right in the 
European fashion. 

It is also proposed to make " radical changes in the 
grammar of the Japanese language," so as to recognize 
constructions that have lately been introduced through 
imitation of Western modes of thought. This proposal 
has, of course, " evoked a loud protest from the votaries 
of classical Japanese," but is " welcomed by the literary 
public in general." 

These attempts to conform the Japanese language to 
the requirements of foreign intercourse are accompanied 
by an increased interest in the study of foreign lan- 
guages. This extends, in the first place, to the Korean 
and the Chinese languages, and reaches, also, even in 
spite of political prejudices, to the Russian language 
and literature. "But the language whose status has 
been most extensively and permanently improved is En- 
glish," the importance of which, " as a medium for con- 
ducting business transactions and international inter- 
course," is now more fully recognized. 

This same tendency to emphasize the necessity of 
" modernizing " is apparent in a recent address on " The 
Future of Japanese Literature," by Professor Tsubou- 
chi, " one of Japan's foremost literati." He spoke along 
this line: 

" At the present time, unfortunately, there are no 
standard works in the realm of Japanese literary thought. 
Those works which foreigners read in a translated form, 
believing them to be the finest literary products of 
Japan, are without exception old classics, and have 
nothing in common with the trend of modern ideas. It 
is impossible to rest satisfied with this state of affairs; 
we cannot hope that Occidentals will ever rightly un- 
derstand the Japanese people if they are to have noth- 
ing better than these antique and obsolete works as their 
standards. The encouragement of a national literature 
is thus at the present moment of prime importance. It 
is the only means which will serve to promote an inti- 
macy with the Western world. We have now to pro- 
duce a series of masterpieces that will show us in the 
true light the progressive, invincible Japanese of the 
19th century." 

It will certainly be interesting and instructive for all 
scholars, especially for comparative philologists, to watch 
these attempts to reform a language and a literature 
that are not only of old standing, but that for at least 
two and a half centuries were crystallized. Even 
though radical reforms may not be accomplished, great 
changes will be made, have already been made, in both 
the language and the literature of Japan.

A FINANCIER OF FRANCE.* 

To most English readers, the name of Tur- 
got is only one in a group of distinguished men 
who, in the middle of the eighteenth century, 
prepared the mind of France for the transition 
from the old to the new regime consummated 
by the Revolution. His writings, however, 
have not ceased to interest and instruct thought- 
ful readers who desire to learn something about 
one of the most interesting men of his century, 
and to know accurately the condition of France 
in the twenty-five years prior to the Revolution. 
" Every science, every language, every litera- 
ture, every business," says Michelet, " inter- 
ested Turgot." " He took to the work of civil 
government," says Matthew Arnold, " in what 
spirit many of us know, and whoever of us does 
not know should make it his business to learn." 
" The nineteenth century is the true century 
of Turgot," says Leon Say, " because it is that 
in which his ideas have been applied, and in 
which he has borne manifest sway over minds 
and over things." These are quite sufficient 
reasons to justify Mr. Stephens in his " attempt 
to provide English readers with a fuller and 
more exact knowledge of Turgot and his writ- 
ings than they have hitherto possessed." Mr. 
Stephens, within the limits he set, has probably 
condensed, as he says, into a single volume all 
matter of sufficient importance and interest for 
general readers of the present day. Industrial 
students, however, who can spare the time, will 
not be satisfied with selections and condensa- 
tions, but will go to the original fountains 
the entire works of Turgot. 

Prior to the Revolution, there were only three 
openings for sons of the French nobility 
civil administration, the army, and the church. 
Turgot, being the youngest of three sons, was 
destined for the church. He was accordingly 
sent to the Sorbonne, where, however, his 
studies took a wide range, including a full 
course in the civil law. At the conclusion of 
these studies, and with his father's consent, he 
announced his determination not to follow the 
ecclesiastical calling. His fellow-students urged 
him, with many reasons, to reconsider his de- 
termination. "Take for yourselves," he re- 
plied, " the counsel you have given me, since 
you can follow it. Although I love you, I can-

not enter into your views. As for me, it is im- 
possible to subject myself all my life to wear- 
ing a veil over my face." 

For a few years after leaving the Sorbonne, 
Turgot held a judicial office. In 1761 he was 
appointed Intendant of the Generality of Li- 
moges, the poorest of the thirty-five Generalities 
in France. But genius makes its own place. 
He refused many offers to transfer him to richer 
and more desirable Generalities. For thirteen 
years he gave the best of his life to the people 
of Limoges, who excited his sympathies because 
they were oppressed and degraded. He began 
at once to institute those reforms with which 
his name will ever be associated. Taxes were 
unequal, and the heaviest burdens were laid 
upon those who could least support them. He 
restored equality and removed the undue bur- 
den. The roads were made by the forced and 
unpaid labor of the peasants. He abolished 
compulsory service, substituted equal taxation, 
and changed the poorest into the best roads of 
the kingdom. The details of his great work 
cannot be given here. He sought from every- 
body information in relation to his duties. 
Through the curates, who were near to the peo- 
ple, he gained the people's confidence. In those 
laborious years he studied profoundly the causes 
of the evils existing in France ; and his reports 
to the Comptroller-General during that period, 
while accurately stating the facts of the cases 
under consideration, were also economic treat- 
ises, good for all time. The reader who cares 
to pursue the subject fully will find the desired 
information in the works of Turgot, and no- 
where besides. 

Turgot had a scholar's love of study. He 
was probably the profoundest thinker then in 
France. He knew the sacrifice he made. His 
friend Condorcet wrote to him : " You are very 
fortunate in having a passion for the public 
good, and in being able to satisfy it ; it is a 
great consolation, and of a very superior order 
to the consolation of mere study." "Nay," 
replied Turgot, " whatever you may say, I be- 
lieve that the satisfaction derived from study 
is superior to any other kind of satisfaction. 
I am perfectly convinced that one may be, 
through study, a thousand times more useful 
to men than in any of our subordinate posts." 

Turgot was appointed Comptroller-General 
of Finance, July 24, 1774 ; and held the office 
a little more than twenty months. He devoted 
every spare moment of that period, with intense 
and passionate earnestness, to the execution of 
his comprehensive scheme of reform. He un-

derstood well the risk he was taking, the oppo- 
sition he would encounter, and the danger of 
failure in the execution of his plan ; but he 
considered that the emergencies of the time 
justified him in taking any personal risks in 
order to avert if possible the greater calamities 
of the then pending Revolution. His method 
was statesmanlike. " If one is not to give up 
the attempt to correct little by little the faults 
of an ancient constitution," he said, " it is 
necessary to work to that end slowly and ac- 
cording to the measure in which public opinion 
and the course of events render changes possi- 
ble." He was not a novice. He had been 
twenty-one years in public life, had travelled 
over the provinces of France with his friend 
the celebrated Gournay, then perhaps the clos- 
est living observer of economic conditions. 
Turgot's special studies, as well as his great 
experience, qualified him in the highest degree 
to prepare to explain and to introduce the gen- 
eral scheme of reforms with which his name 
will be forever identified. In a general way it 
may be said that these reforms involved the 
reestablishment of the public finances, then 
deranged to the verge of bankruptcy ; the cor- 
rection of innumerable abuses which were the 
heritage from a worn-out feudal system ; the 
destruction of special privileges, under the 
operation of which the mass of the people were 
reduced to poverty and despair ; freedom from 
the monopoly of the guilds ; and freedom of 
commerce and the industries from intolerable 
burdens and restrictions. Turgot's state papers 
during this period are the best existing exposi- 
tion of all these evils and the measures he took 
to reform them. 

France at that period had no constitution 
in the English or in the American sense. There 
was no organized public opinion to which a 
statesman could make an appeal. The blind 
obstinacy of the privileged classes was such 
that no material reforms could be effected ex- 
cept by the prerogative of the king or by revo- 
lution. Turgot relied only upon the prerogatives 
of the king, whose power was absolute ; for 
France at that time was monarchical to the 
core. The king controlled the purse and the 
sword. He could send his parliaments, then 
judicial bodies, into exile or into bastiles. He 
could, by his edicts, make and repeal laws ; and 
he had control of all the offices of administra- 
tion. It was upon this vast power that Turgot 
relied. The king at first resolved to sustain 
Turgot in all his proposed reforms. The queen 
and her courtiers, the nobility and the higher 



clergy who had inherited their privileges, and 
the rich bourgeois who had bought them, would 
not have it so. The weak king yielded to the 
pressure. Turgot was driven from the Minis- 
try, and his reforms were not then accom- 
plished. A little more than eight years after 
Turgot's death, his triumph came, not, how- 
ever, as the great statesman desired, by the 
peaceful and orderly steps of progressive re- 
form, but through the exaltation of revolution- 
ary feeling, when, on the memorable night of 
the fourth of August, 1789, all feudal rights 
and privileges were abolished, and France 
passed at once and forever from the old to the 
new regime. 

The selections made by Mr. Stephens give 
a fair idea of Turgot's rank as an economist. 
The average reader has but little conception of 
the restrictions laid upon trade, commerce, and 
the industries, in Turgot's time ; and does not 
appreciate the debt of gratitude we owe to the 
earlier economists who led the way to the com- 
parative freedom now enjoyed in those pursuits. 
The celebrated edicts prepared by Turgot dur- 
ing his ministry were based upon his matured 
convictions that industry and the exchanges of 
commerce, being entirely a matter of individ- 
ual right, should be maintained free from every 
restriction on the part of government, and that 
it was no part of the function of government to 
interfere at any time or anywhere with these in- 
dividual rights ; that the imprescriptible right 
of labor involved as corollaries, first, the right 
to enjoy property as the fruits of labor, and, sec- 
ond, the unqualified right of exchange between 
individuals. All those great edicts were pre- 
ceded by ' ' Memoires" fully explaining their pur- 
poses. Leon Say says : " That which impressed 
the friends of the minister at first, and united 
the approbation of all men of elevation of mind, 
was the care taken by Turgot to explain in an 
extended preamble the reasons of the change 
made by the new decree to the legislation then 
in force. To discuss before the public, was a 
novelty. Turgot was thus the inventor of that 
usage, generally practiced since in free govern- 
ments, to preface the projects of laws by that 
which we call to-day an exposition of its mo- 
tives." And Voltaire said : " We have not be- 
fore had edicts in which the sovereign deigned 
to teach his people, to reason with them, to in- 
struct them in their interests, to persuade them 
before commanding them." These great writ- 
ers are, however, not quite accurate in their 
claim that Turgot was the inventor of this ad- 
mirable usage. In the fourth book of Plato's

" Laws " (pp. 720 et seq.) the Athenian 
Stranger says : " And is our legislator to have 
no preface to his laws, but to say at once 
do this, avoid that ; and then, holding the pen- 
alty in terrorem, to go on to another law ; offer- 
ing never a word of advice or exhortation to 
those for whom he is legislating?" It is 
credit enough for Turgot that he was the first 
to embody in the laws of a great people the 
ideas of the immortal Greek thinker. 

Turgot's writings cover a period of about 
thirty years. His first publication, 1749, is a 
letter to L'Abbe de Cice upon Money. In 
that letter he exploded the mischievous brood 
of fallacies that still torment us, based upon 
the same error that the fiat of government can 
compel commodities of unequal value to be 
taken as equivalents in exchange for each other. 
Mirabeau exploited that fallacy, with his usual 
eloquence, when he misled a small majority of 
the Constituent Assembly into issuing the as- 
signats, and, with the usual result, paralyzing 
the industries of France for six years from 
1790. Seventy-two years later, our practical 
statesmen, who had learned nothing from the 
economists and nothing from the experience of 
the nations, put out the " legal tenders," at a 
cost to the people of the United States, it is 
estimated, of some thousand millions of dollars. 
A great fallacy is sometimes more costly than 
a great war. 

The last state paper of Turgot, dated April 
6, 1776, was a "Memoire" prepared in re- 
sponse to a request from Louis XVI. for his 
opinion in writing in relation to the part 
France ought to take in the American war. 
Vergennes, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, had 
determined to declare war against England, 
ostensibly in aid of the Colonies. Turgot, for 
many statesmanlike reasons which I cannot 
here recite, advised the king to give the col- 
onies every possible assistance allowed by an 
honorable neutrality, but not to declare war in 
their favor. Vergennes cared nothing for the 
American cause. Turgot cared for all causes 
in which men struggled for freedom. His whole 
official life was a protest against the restrictions 
which monopoly imposed upon industry and 
trade within the limits of France. He did not, 
however, believe that the principle governing 
trade was limited by national boundaries, and 
that restrictions upon it ceased to be injurious 
when they become colonial or international ; 
and in his last state paper he declared that the 
independence of the English colonies would dis- 
sipate the delusion which for two centuries had 



led European nations erroneously to believe 
that they could gain wealth by reserving to 
themselves the exclusive right to buy from and 
sell to their colonies. " I firmly believe," says 
Turgot, " that all the mother-countries will be 
forced to abandon all empire over their colonies, 
to leave to them entire freedom of commerce 
with all nations, to content themselves in par- 
taking along with the others this liberty, and 
in maintaining with their colonies the ties of 
friendship and fraternity."

OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE or THE 
ORIGIN OF SPECIES.* 



In Professor Marshall's " Lectures on the 
Darwinian Theory " we find a simple, direct, 
and accurate account of our present knowledge 
of the origin of species. The matter is cast in 
the form of University Extension lectures 
eight in number elementary in character,, 
as befits the interest of an intelligent but un- 
scientific audience. In his exposition, Profes- 
sor Marshall follows closely the lines of argu- 
ment laid down by Darwin. In other words, 
he is guided by what is really known, and has 
no hypothesis of his own to be maintained or 
illustrated. 

In reading these lectures, one is impressed 
by the self-restraint of the author. He never 
forgets his purpose, never falls into rhetoric, 
never makes points, and never puts himself in 
any degree into a controversial attitude. Out 
of the wealth of his knowledge he draws noth- 
ing that he does not need. Often the results 
of years of investigation are summarized in a 
single paragraph. Matters still under dispute 
as the inheritance of acquired characters 
are passed by without mention, as not yet a 
part of science. Every effort is made to con- 
centrate attention on that which is known and 
essential to the doctrine of the development of 
species through natural selection. 

The analogies between changes in words by 
natural selection and changes in species are 
well brought out by Professor Marshall. The 
physical kinship of man with the lower ani- 
mals is very clearly shown. He says : 

" In fact, unless man wishes to continue going about 
the world stamped with living and palpable proof of

his kinship with lower animals, he had better stop up 
his ears, or, still better, cut them off altogether; for so 
long as he bears at the side of his head those tell-tale 
flaps, with their aborted and rudimentary muscles, so 
long as he hears by means of that slit, once a gillcleft, 
now by change of function become an accessory organ 
of hearing, so long does he carry about in sight of all 
men sure proof of his relationship with lower, even with 
water-breathing, animals. Yet one can scarcely recom- 
mend the operation, for if you were to remove one by 
one the various parts of your body which proclaim this 
kinship, you would get rid in succession of skin, mus- 
cles, nerves, bones, etc., and all that would be left in 
the end as man's special and peculiar possessions would 
be: (1) certain parts of his brain, and these only doubt- 
fully; (2) the extensor primi internodii pollicis muscle, 
which straightens the first joint of the thumb; (3) the 
peroneus tertius, a small muscle in front of the lower 
part of the leg and ankle, inserted into the base of the 
little toe; (4) certain portions of other muscles. 

" Again, if we turn from bodily structure to the other 
characteristics of man, we find the same tendency to 
over-population, resulting in the same struggle for ex- 
istence and the same survival of the fittest. Indeed, it 
was from the study of Malthus' ' Essay on Population ' 
that Darwin was led to the theory of Natural Selection. 
So it is with the history of the rise and fall of nations, 
with the evolution of human speech, customs, and cloth- 
ing. All alike conform to the same laws as those regu- 
lating the structure and habits of other animals. And 
so with the influence of man on other animals; the ad- 
vent of man has simply been the arrival of another ani- 
mal, better equipped, and more cunning, more cruel, 
than any other; acting with supreme selfishness; toler- 
ating the existence of other animals only when they can 
be made subservient to his own wants or pleasures; 
ruthlessly exterminating all that offends or thwarts him. 
His only kindness is merely a nominal exception, for if 
perchance he appear kindly disposed to certain animals, 
it is only to satisfy his own selfish ends, that he may 
fleece them of their coats or pluck them of their feath- 
ers to adorn himself; or to fatten them, that they may 
acquire a flavour more acceptable to his palate." 



Again, referring 
Marshall observes : 



to Language, Professor 



" Language has been said to be ' the one great differ- 
ence between man and brutes,' and an ' insurmountable 
obstacle to the theory of alliance by descent.' This has 
been urged even by those who accept the theory as ap- 
plying to all other animals. 

" But has not language a history, has it not been 
evolved gradually, and is it not constantly, even daily, 
undergoing change ? Is not this evolution, are not 
these changes of a nature precisely similar to those which 
have governed the animal kingdom in other branches, 
and have made it what it is at the present day ? " 

The controverted questions as to man's spir- 
itual kinship with the beasts are brushed aside, 
perhaps too easily, on the doubtful ground that 
science has nothing to say regarding them. 

" Whether there is anything further than this, 
whether man has other attributes, either peculiar to 
himself or held by him in common with other animals, 
whether these are attributes that cannot be explained 
by these laws, is a question with which we have no 



concern here. Science has nothing to do with such mat- 
ters, and has nothing to say for or against them." 

One slight error may be noted. Surely the 
lung of mammals is not derived from the swim- 
bladder of fishes. The swim-bladder is a de- 
generate organ, existing in all stages of degra- 
dation. It was developed from a respiratory 
structure which in land animals has culminated 
in the lung. 

Professor Marshall's lectures are printed in 
a handsome volume, with new and excellent

THE BASES OF APPRECIATION iisr ART.* 



Mr. Marshall's more popular presentation of 
the subject of ^Esthetics has to contend with a 
difficulty that confronts any other book on the 
theory of art. The " general reader " does not 
desire instruction on the topic. Political econ- 
omy is one of those matters on which, accord- 
ing to common feeling, any voter has as good 
a right to an opinion as the most devoted and 
learned student. Such is also the case in mat- 
ters pertaining to the fine arts, with the addi- 
tion that here special thought and exact knowl- 
edge are usually held to cloud and befog the 
freshness necessary to excellent views on the 
subject. In literature, in painting, and else- 
where, the generally accepted dictum is, " I 
don't know anything about the rules of art, but 
I know what I like," with which is coupled a 
firm determination not to like anything that one 
doesn't want to of one's own mere motion, and, 
indeed, not to submit to any interference that 
in any respect smacks of thought or knowledge 
of the matter in hand. 

Discussions, then, of the reasons which un- 
derlie our artistic appreciation, and principles 
which may be deduced as to what is better to like 
and what worse, are sure to meet at the outset 
with a good deal of indifference and prejudice 
in the mind of the general reader. The psy- 
chologist, the critic, the art student, may wel- 
come a new theory ; a few thinking readers 
may be interested ; but unless it is presented 
in a particularly persuasive manner, the hearts 
of most readers do not warm to it. It is per- 
haps just as well. ^Esthetics is a science, and 
so demands in the reader a certain tempera- 
ment and a certain preparation. As most peo- 
ple have neither the temperament nor the pre-

paration, they can no more understand fully a 
theory of the beautiful than they can a theory 
of the origin of species. 

In spite of this, some books on aesthetic sub- 
jects have such a charm or power of presenta- 
tion as to have been a good deal read. Taine's 
works, especially the "English Literature," and 
Euskin's "Modern Painters," are cases in 
point. These books owed their popularity 
chiefly to their style. Now, unfortunately, Mr. 
Marshall has not any special gift of style. He 
writes clearly and concisely : he is not (in the 
present book at least) a difficult author. But 
he has not any special igift of popular exposi- 
tion. "Esthetic Principles " can be read easily 
enough if one is determined to read it, but it 
has no charm, it does not tempt the indifferent 
to continue ; unless impelled by his own zeal, 
the reader is not unlikely to faint by the way- 
side. Despite the effort to the contrary, the 
book is somewhat arid. 

This is the more unfortunate, since Mr. Mar- 
shall has much that would be of use to just the 
sort of reader whom he will fail to interest. If 
one can emerge from the class of readers in 
question and realize that we have here a dis- 
cussion of a profoundly interesting topic, one 
will find in "Esthetic Principles " a great 
deal that is worth while. Mr. Marshall's first 
book was original and scholarly ; so is this one, 
and also far simpler and less technical. 

One great excellence, on the whole the first 
to be remarked, is that Mr. Marshall not only 
recognizes that there are different points of 
view in this matter, but plans his book on that 
basis. People are apt to read different things 
about art, a bit from Taine, as has been said, 
something of Ruskin's perhaps, and some hard 
saying of Hegel, and there is generally a bad 
hitch when they try to coordinate their views. 
They seem to be on wholly different topics. 
Everybody doesn't know, or doesn't see at once, 
that Taine is generally concerned with those 
forces which go to produce a work of art, while 
Ruskin is apt to be thinking of those forces which 
a work of art tends to produce, and Hegel con- 
siders beauty rather in itself than as a cause or 
an effect. Mr. Marshall begins almost at once 
with " two different standpoints : first, the ' Ob- 
server's Standpoint,' relating to the field of 
Impression ; and, second, the * Artist's Stand- 
point,' which deals with the Art Instinct." And 
the first of these is developed into a Critic's 
Standpoint ; which gives us three ways of look- 
ing at the matter. 

The term " observer " does not seem to me 



a very happy one. When we have looked at 
a picture, or read a book, or heard music, or 
anything of the sort, we never think of our- 
selves as observers. When we think of an ob- 
server we think of somebody studying the habits 
of the domestic fly, or the tendencies of our 
present social system, or something of the sort. 
Where art is concerned, we are hardly observ- 
ers, we are enjoyers. But " enjoyer " is a ridicu- 
lous word, and when we try for another we have 
no easy task in improving Mr. Marshall's ter- 
minology : amateur, art-lover, connoisseur, 
none of them give us anything of the idea we 
have in mind, of the normal person of cultiva- 
tion who receives enjoyment from the various 
forms of art. In spite of all this, however, one 
cannot remain contented with " observer "; it 
introduces into the idea a dry scholastic ele- 
ment, which should be very foreign to it. As 
to the use of the word artist for " the aBsthetic 
worker in each and all of the varied fields in 
which beauty is of moment," that use of the 
word has been so long habitual to many writers, 
that even those who usually understand by it 
" painters and draughtsmen only " will be ready 
to extend their conception. 

Beginning, then, with this division of our 
study into three topics the Observer's, the 
Artist's, the Critic's Standpoints we get at 
once a good way out of Egypt, and come to 
Mr. Marshall's special theory. As to this the- 
ory, on which the book is built, it is not nec- 
essary to discuss it now. It is, of course, the 
theory propounded more fully and scientifically 
in the author's " Pain, Pleasure, and JEsthet- 
ics," published a year or so ago in book form, 
and before that in one of the philosophical 
journals. It is a theory which calls for the 
special criticism of the psychologist : the gen- 
eral reader is no better off if one authority pro- 
nounces it sound, and no worse off if another 
authority pronounces it fallacious. The chief 
point of interest, I believe, is that it is a theory 
which is stimulating and suggestive. Once get 
hold of the idea, that, for each man, that is 
beautiful which results in pleasurable " reviv- 
als," or recollections, and that he will do well 
to think beautiful that which results in pleas- 
urable recollections to the ideal type of the cul- 
tivated man (the esthetic man, if we do well 
to imitate the Frankenstein of the political 
economists), once get a good idea of what is 
meant by this conception and of the possible 
applications of it, and one finds a sort of spur, 
and at the same time a help, in thinking about 
some things that have been puzzling.

THE DIAL 



143 



Many people will seriously object to the as- 
sumption that the aim of art is only to give 
pleasure. The objection comes from the dif- 
ferent ideas of pleasure that people have. Some 
people regard pleasure as being at bottom a 
deceitful, grovelling evil. Others conceive more 
readily of pleasures which are candid and noble, 
which do not lead astray, but carry us to places 
where we say, " It is good for us to be here." 
Naturally enough, those who think of pleasure 
as something essentially low do not feel that 
mere pleasure is a very good aim for art or for 
anything else. Mr. Marshall, however, under- 
stands by pleasure a quality which may belong 
to any element of consciousness. It is subject- 
ive : the pleasures of a noble man are noble, the 
pleasures of a degraded man are not. The 
pleasures of a good man are in good things, and 
they lead him to desire them. The pleasures 
of our artistic type are, then, of a fine and in- 
spiring kind ; they are not Capuan in charac- 
ter, nor is their effect relaxing. But the word 
" Hedonist " has a bad sound in the ears of a 
nation which has not forgotten the Puritans, 
and there will be many who will not be able to 
think with equanimity of pleasure as the aim 
of art. 

However this may be, Mr. Marshall shows 
how the assumption gives a basis to the art- 
lover, the artist, the critic. He then proceeds 
to amplify the last topic in a discussion of " gen- 
eral laws of esthetic practice from a consider- 
ation of the conditions upon which pleasure- 
getting depends." Here we may leave the 
subject, with a single remark. 

I have said that Mr. Marshall has not the 
gift of a persuasive and engaging style. He 
has, however, a very nice way of working his 
principles out into applications which take our 
attention at once. We are attracted by his de- 
veloping the conclusion that an early disposi- 
tion to draw pictures does not constitute a di- 
vine call to an artist's life ; we see that we have 
to do, not with a mere theorizer, but with a 
scholar who has his own outlook on the world. 
So, also, when he shows us that bad architec- 
ture is a lasting calamity, that it is impossible 
that everyone should enjoy the best art, espe- 
cially such as have always lived in the " slums," 
that although different people must like differ- 
ent things, some are better worth liking than 
others, and so on. Such points serve a double 
purpose : they are hints to us for our own think- 
ing, and they give us confidence in our author, 
a confidence in this case not undeserved.

SEVEX BOOKS OF TRAVEL,.* 



Mr. Swettenham, the author of u Malay Sketches," 
informs us that his is " not a book of travels," but 
rather " a series of sketches of Malay scenery and 
Malay character, drawn by one who has spent the 
best part of his life in the scenes and amongst the 
people he describes." We judge, however, that an 
account by a foreigner resident in strange lands is, 
in a large and true sense, a book of travel. The 
mere fact that one writes from a foreign country 
from a stationary point of view, as in Mrs. Martin's 
" Ostrich Farm," Lady Barker's " South Africa," 
or Mr. Swettenham's " Malay Sketches," does not 
debar the work from being considered a book of 
travels. One who stops in a country a few years, 
and gives us a book about it, does not radically 
differ from him who stops a month and gives us a 
chapter. Mr. Swettenham is connected with the 
English Government in Perak, a division of the 
Malay Peninsula ; and he has there made the ob- 
servations upon which this book is based. It is his 
object to put before us the real Malay in his own 
environment ; to give us an intimate knowledge of 
his appearance, character, and habits. But we are 
disappointed in finding that this Malay is not, after 
all, the real aboriginal one, but the Islamized, and 
to some extent Europeanized, one. This modernized 
Malay, who dynamites fish, who has tricycles and 
music-boxes, who is under police and judges, is de- 
scribed by our author simply and clearly. Still, de- 
scription of scenery and people, even when good, is 
inferior to illustration, which this book entirely 
lacks. A lifelike picture of a Perak Malay would 
save many words of description, and help the reader 
to realize his characteristics. Mr. Swettenham offers 
to " the jaded pleasure-seekers of the West " a new 
form of amusement practised by the Malays, namely, 
sliding down a waterfall into a pool at the base. 
He has probably never heard of our water-chutes. 
His chapter on the running Amok does not enlighten 
us much as to its real nature and causes. Again, 
he asserts that the Malays cannot be christianized, 
but still, in his opinion, they are not to be swept out 
of existence by superior races ; two opinions that are

not supported by due evidence. On the whole, this 
book does not attain its object ; it is not a deep study, 
and the reader gets merely a few rather superficial 
glimpses of this interesting people. The writer's 
point of view is, after all, that of an outsider and 
of one in authority. If some artistic realist, like 
Miss Wilkins, would go to Perak and write tales 
full of local color, we should gain that complete pic- 
ture of the Malay which this book cannot give us. 

Mr. F. G. Jackson, in the expedition which he 
describes in " The Great Frozen Land," had two 
objects in view : " the first and more important was 
to experiment with and test a selected variety of 
equipment, clothing, and food, under the conditions 
of an Arctic winter, in order that the results of this 
experience might be utilized in the more prolonged 
and far more difficult journey contemplated to the 
unknown Arctic area north of Franz Josef Land." 
The second object was " to visit and, for some 
months, to live with that primitive group of the hu- 
man family, the Samoyads of the Great Frozen 
Tundra of Arctic Russia." These two objects Mr. 
Jackson fairly accomplished in his journey through 
Siberia and Lapland in the winter of 1893-94. To 
the general reader, the most interesting part of his 
book is that which describes the rude Samoyads. 
Mr. Jackson thus pictures a night halt at a wayside 
hut or choom: 

" As we found three Samoyads there, we made in all 
a party of nine in a choom nine by ten. And I must not 
forget indeed, I cannot forget that in addition to 
these, there was a Samoyad baby of about eighteen 
months, who kept up a vigorous crying and made itself 
generally felt. My companions, including the Russian, 
were soon deep in a feast on raw reindeer, and the Sam- 
oyad lady on my right comfortably seated herself on the 
ground and placed the stomach of a deer on her lap. 
It was full of blood, and she dipped in it the pieces of 
raw meat she was eating. As the coloured candles 
the same as they use before their ikons flared and nick- 
ered, the blood-smeared faces of these hungry eaters 
framed in a strange circle of primitive life. However, 
hunger provided sauce and overlooked surroundings, 
and I supped well, and then tried to thaw the sleeping- 
bag, which had frozen hard after getting wet (we had 
been driving in 14 F. of frost), but the attempt was 
not very successful, and I had eventually to sleep on 
the ground in my clothes. It was amusing to see the 
baby, which had been sitting up and had eaten a fairly 
good supper of raw meat, put to bed by its mother. She 
first wrapped it in furs, then placed it in a box shaped 
like a coffin, and laced it in with narrow strips of hide, 
so that it was not only impossible for it to fall out, but 
also very difficult for it even to move." 
And yet these people who live on raw meat, and 
who never bathe or change their clothes, are affected 
by the ceramic craze, their chief treasures being 
china cups and saucers. Though publicly Chris- 
tians, in private they are pagans. Mr. Jackson's 
description of the frozen Siberian marsh or Tundra 
is impressive : 

" Nothing I know of in nature can equal the dreari- 
ness and solitude of the Tundra. Mile after mile, as 
you travel along, there is no break in the monotony of 



this great frozen land. Everywhere is snow, everywhere 
the vast white plains. In the perspective of distance, 
the very ridges melt into the general level; and as you 
look around, everywhere you are met with the same 
great mantle of unbroken snow. The country lies be- 
fore you as an earth that is dead, so still, so motionless, 
so rigid is the landscape. Life has fled before the icy 
winds which draw out of the north, and the land you 
traverse is surely the land of death. There is scarcely 
the cry of a single bird to break upon the ear in this 
untenanted wilderness ; the very streams are motionless 
masses of ice. Track there is none, and you may wan- 
der east, west, north, and south, without a landmark to 
set you right. Day after day and week after week your 
deer will gallop along their frozen way, and your com- 
pass, or, if the grey clouds will lift for a while, the stars 
in the heaven above, will be your only guide." 

This book is a conscientious piece of work. It is 
well illustrated, and is provided with very good 
maps. It concludes with chapters on Language and 
on Folk -Tales, and with appendices of scientific 
value. While on the whole it appeals more to the 
scientist and explorer, the book possesses no little 
interest for the general reader. 

Miss Hapgood is well and favorably known as a 
translator of the works of Tolstdy (as she spells 
the name). In her volume of " Russian Rambles," 
which is largely a reprint of magazine articles, she 
seeks to dispel " some of the absurd ideas which 
are now current about Russia," that is, ideas of 
Russia as a country full of despotic cruelty, of start- 
lingly strange customs, and where the visitor is being 
constantly dogged by a lynx-eyed police. She de- 
nounces (p. vi.) as an incredible yarn the story that a 
peasant was met on the NeVsky Prospe*kt, " holding 
in his hand a live chicken, from which he was taking 
occasional bites, feathers and all." However, her 
own story (p. 115) about " people walking along 
the streets with bunches of pea-vines, from which 
they were plucking the peas, and eating them, pods 
and all, quite raw," might seem to some people a 
doubtful tale. Miss Hapgood is too severe in her 
constant polemic against other writers. Others need 
not be disbelieved in order to believe her. If she 
had comparatively little annoyance from the pass- 
port system, and the censorship, for example, this 
was largely due to her tact and knowledge of the 
native language* One official, indeed, was so im- 
pressed by her proficiency that, 

" Rising, drawing himself up, with the heels of his high 
wrinkled boots in regulation contact, and the scarlet 
pipings of his baggy green trousers and tight coat brist- 
ling with martial etiquette, he made me a profound 
bow, hand on heart, and said : ' Madam, accept the 
thanks of Russia for the high honor you have done her 
in learning her difficult language.' " 

Miss Hapgood has kept the best wine to the last ; 
her earlier chapters are rather inferior in interest 
and style to the later ones. Four out of the eleven 
pages of Chapter IV., " Bargaining in Russia," are 
taken up with a description of furs and Russian 
houses. For the best remarks on bargaining and 
shopping, see pp. 109 ff. Chapters V.-VIII. and 



1895.]

X. XI. may be recommended as the most entertain- 
ing and instructive in the book. Miss Hapgood 
became quite intimately acquainted with Count 
Tolstdy, and her description of the man is very in- 
teresting and seems quite veracious. 

" I am aware that it has become customary of late to 
call Count Tolstdy ' crazy,' or ' not quite right in the 
head,' etc. The inevitable conclusion of any one who 
talks much with him is that he is nothing of the sort; 
but simply a man with a hobby or an idea. His idea hap- 
pens to be one which, granting it ought to be adopted 
by everybody, is peculiarly difficult in his own case. 
And it is an uncomfortable theory of self-denial which 
very few people like to have preached to them in any 
form. Add to tbis that his philosophical exposition of 
his theory lacks the clearness which generally not 
always results from a course of strict preparatory train- 
ing, and we have more than enough foundation for the 
reports of his mental aberration. On personal acquain- 
tance he proves to be a remarkably earnest, thoroughly 
convinced, and winning man, although he does not de- 
liberately do or say anything to attract one. His very 
earnestness is provocative of argument." 

Miss Hapgood falls often into the easy fault of 
travellers, of using foreign words without due ex- 
planation. For instance, on pages 250-251, there 
are five Russian words at whose meaning we are 
left to guess (cf. pages 87, 106, 243, 249). If Rus- 
sian words must be used, there should be a glossary. 
But on the whole, this is a very commendable book. 
Miss Hapgood, by knowing the language and going 
without guides, improved the opportunity, during a 
two-years residence in Russia, of coming to a direct 
knowledge of the people and of the country, and 
she has given expression to these experiences in a 
bright femininely written account. Certain surface 
aspects of Russian life are pleasantly and truthfully 
treated, and if this was the aim of the book it is 
certainly a success. 

If Miss Hapgood gives us the brighter side of 
Russian life, Mr. Bigelow, in " The Borderland of 
Czar and Kaiser," emphasizes the darker side. To 
Mr. Bigelow, Russia is a " sad gray land," a " mourn- 
ful empire," where the unmitigated political despot- 
ism of the czar and his officials, the religious despot- 
ism of a fanatical priesthood, and the financial des- 
potism of the avaricious Jew, make life not worth 
the living. Further, he regards the peasantry as a 
hopeless race of dull and shiftless drunkards. The 
book is mostly made up of a series of conversations 
with chance acquaintances. But Mr. Bigelow in 
this way gets too much at second-hand to make his 
work either very reliable or interesting. His studies 
are not independent, unbiassed, first-hand impres- 
sions, and seem hardly candid or thorough. In 
these respects, however, his remarks on Germany 
are more satisfactory than the Russian sketches. 
Most if not all of the material has previously ap- 
peared in " Harper's Magazine." The book is clev- 
erly illustrated by Mr. Frederic Remington. 

In " The Great Dominion," Mr. Parkin has given 
us a good book of information, provided with ex- 



cellent maps, and of especial interest to the intend- 
ing settler or investor. It is for the most part a 
reprint of letters to the " London Times," and takes 
on the whole a very optimistic view of Canada as 
a British possession. He regards the annexation 
movement as practically dead. 

" In 1892, some remnant of this feeling could yet be 
discovered; in 1894 it was gone. The unparalleled 
wave of business depression which swept over the United 
States during the interval; the spectacle of Coxeyite 
armies of the unemployed moving on Washington; of 
Atlantic steamboats crowded with emigrants returning 
from the United States ; of industry paralyzed by strikes 
which divided authority made it difficult to repress, 
all made Canadians more conscious than they had ever 
been before of the serious social and political problems 
which their neighbours have to confront. The fact that 
Canada's industrial condition was meanwhile scarcely 
affected, emphasized the advantages of her independent 
position on the continent." 

The Great Canadian Northwest is rapidly filling 
up with desirable immigrants. There are now ten 
thousand Icelanders in Manitoba. Further, there 
is a considerable immigration from the United 
States, especially from Dakota, Nebraska, and 
Washington. This, however, is more than offset by 
the emigration of French Canadians into " the 
States," though Mr. Parkin regards M. Louis Frech- 
ette's estimate, in " The Forum," of eleven to twelve 
hundred thousand Canadians now resident in the 
United States, as "much exaggerated." Yet I find 
that the census returns show over one million immi- 
grants into this country from Canada during the last 
thirty years, and it must be apparent that Frechette's 
is rather an under estimate. Moreover, the French 
Canadian is enormously prolific. On this point, 
Mr. Parkin himself says : 

" Three or four years ago the government of the 
province, reverting to the policy of the French Kings 
in the early days of Canadian colonization, instituted a 
system of premiums on large families, by offering to 
give a grant of a hundred acres of land to all heads of 
families who had twelve or more children. This grant 
has already been made in nearly 2000 cases, and appli- 
cations are said to be flowing in. Families of twenty 
children are common; families of twenty-five or more 
are not unknown." 

Mr. Parkin emphasizes the perfect security to life 
and property in Canadian frontier life as a contrast 
to the lawlessness so often displayed in the Western 
life of the United States. However, he says noth- 
ing about the Indian difficulties in the Canadian 
Northwest, nor does he even refer to the Indian 
problem at all. 

Dr. Henry M. Field, the veteran traveller and 
writer of travels, in his last book, " Our Western 
Archipelago," gives an account of an Alaskan 
trip. However, less than seventy pages of the two 
hundred and fifty are concerned with Alaska, the 
rest being a description of the outward trip by the 
Canadian Pacific Railway, and the journey back by 
way of the Northern Pacific and through Yellow- 
stone Park. These familiar letters of travel con-

tain little that is new, or of great interest. The 
style is rather diffuse and garrulous, although some- 
times the garrulity may be even attractive, as in 
Chapters V. and VI. In the opening of Chapter 
XXIII. is a suggestive account of a bear who do- 
mesticated himself at a Yellowstone Park hotel as 
readily as a sparrow ; and we quote this account 
as an example of Mr. Field's method of descrip- 
tion : 

" He was not an old acquaintance, as he had come 
from the woods only a week or two before, but was of 
such a domestic turn of mind that he made himself at 
home anywhere, whether 'under the greenwood tree,' 
or under a house or barn. But in coming to abide with 
men he did not submit to be a servant under bondage, 
to be confined in a cage or held by a chain; but was a 
free and independent citizen, free in all his goings out 
and comings in, as if he took the place of a faithful old 
servitor, who has earned the right to have his own way; 
to have the run of the kitchen, or what was thrown out 
from it; and in all respects to live as a pensioner of the 
family. ... I was curious to see this addition to the 
family, and asked Where is he ? ' with vague suspicions 
that he might be a myth. But ' No, no,' said the inn- 
keeper; by and by he will make his appearance. Per- 
haps he is here now.' With that he went about the 
house, looking underneath it, till suddenly he exclaimed, 
' Why, there he is.' I was down on my knees in an in- 
stant, and sure enough, right under the floor, indeed, 
under my very feet, where I had been writing, was what 
might be a bear or a buffalo. The next thing was to 
stir him up, and make him show himself. The master 
of the house tried to poke him with a stick, but had not 
one long enough. Then he threw stones at him. But 
the thick brown hair was proof against stones, and the 
burly old creature slept on with proper contempt of the 
pygmies that were trying to disturb his repose. I con- 
fess, I rather respected him for his royal indifference 
to his puny assailants. The landlord apologized for his 
want of deference to his visitors, but explained it thus: 
' The old fellow takes his time about everything. He 
has probably been off in the woods to visit his family, 
to see Mrs. Bear and his children or grandchildren, and 
is now a little tired. By and by he will wake up and 
feel hungry, and then he will come round to the door 
for his breakfast, which he will take from our hands as 
if he were a Newfoundland dog.' " 

Dr. Field's pleasant, easy-going, optimistic person- 
ality permeates the whole hook. He was accom- 
panied by his niece, and his references to her are 
hardly in taste in a book designed for the general 
reader. Thus, " Oh, dear, oh, dear, my poor little 
chicken, that was hardly out of the hen-coop," etc. 
( p. 235 ). Mr. Field's remarks regarding his friends 
are apt to he rather fulsome ; as, for instance, in 
regard to Lord Dufferin and Mr. Harper (pp. 21, 
25). The book is illustrated with process cuts, and 
is provided with a map. 

The first volume of Mr. Henry M. Stanley's la- 
test work, " My Early Travels and Adventures in 
America and Asia," is a series of letters, which, as 
he himself acknowledges, " were not written with a 
view to permanent publication, but for the exacting 
and imperious necessities of American newspapers, 
principally for 'The Missouri Democrat' of St. 



Louis, and a New York paper." As special corre- 
spondent, Mr. Stanley accompanied General Han- 
cock, and, later, General Sherman, in expeditions 
against the Indians ; and he narrates in vigorous 
and terse style many incidents of Indian and fron- 
tier life. The book throbs with the wild and pro- 
gressive spirit of the sixties in Kansas, Nebraska, 
and Colorado, and will be found very interesting by 
all who have had any experience of pioneer life. 
The story of the Plum Creek Massacre is particu- 
larly vivid. Mr. Stanley's description of the buffalo 
is quotable : 

" Until to-day we were not prepared to accept all the 
statements we heard about the numbers of buffalo on 
the plains, for prairie folk are like sailors, fond of em- 
bellishing the truth. When we were told that the prai- 
rie has been so packed with them that one might walk 
on their backs for ten miles, we set it down to the nar- 
rator's desire to express a countless number, rather than 
as a literal fact. When they swore that, not many years 
ago, military expeditions were compelled to mow a pas- 
sage through them with grape shot from their howit- 
zers, we thought they were taking advantage of the 
credulity of youth, and inwardly lamented their de- 
pravity. We are becoming wiser every day, however. 
We think of all the bales of buffalo robes annually ex- 
ported East, of the many thousands of hides required 
by the 150,000 Indians of the plains for their wigwams, 
of the thousands of robes in use among the military 
and civilians out West; and we are not so skeptical as 
formerly. We have seen many herds at various times, 
but to-day we had the pleasure of seeing ten great 
herds, of about a thousand head each, guarded by their 
sentries and videttes, which suspiciously watched our 
advance, and continually snorted the alarm to the re- 
spective hosts. It was to me a thrilling sight." 

Occasionally these letters show defective editing, 
thus (p. 157), a " first letter " is referred to, which 
nowhere appears. And again (p. 160), there is a 
hiatus after " when it had gathered." If most of 
the official speeches and all the official letters and 
inventories (as on pp. 45, 135, 229), and all other 
matter of historical value, but of no interest to the 
general reader, had been relegated to an appendix, 
and the remaining matter were disconnected from 
the epistolary form and chronological order, and 
thrown by subjects into chapters, we would have a 
very interesting book. As it is, the reader must do 
some judicious skipping, which is always vexatious. 
Mr. Stanley's second volume contains newspaper 
letters on the inauguration of the Suez Canal, on a 
Nile trip, on explorations in Jerusalem, and on a 
journey to Persia. Some of this material may have 
a historical value, but to the general reader much 
in these reports will appear dry and perfunctory. 
Some portions of the Persian journey may be read 
with interest, particularly the visit to Teheran. 
However, most of the topics discussed have been 
much more fully and better treated by other writers. 
In short, we do not think this book will much en- 
hance Mr. Stanley's reputation. He has given us 
the scrapings from his barrel, and we find them 

little satisfying.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

A sensible book The misgiving with which we natur- 
about America, ally take up a book about the United 

by a Frenchwoman. g tategj written by ft f ore i gne r after 

a few months' sojourn in the country, is soon dis- 
pelled after opening the pages of Madame Blanc's 
(Th. Bentzon) " The Condition of Woman in the 
United States," in Miss Alger's excellent transla- 
tion (Roberts). The accomplished author has wisely 
added the modest sub-title, " A Traveller's Notes," 
thus saving the reader all disappointment at a some- 
what careless composition, or rather disposition of 
the material, for the style is all that could be de- 
sired. Less stimulating to thought than more pre- 
tentious publications of this class by writers with 
whom philosophizing is more of a profession, Mme. 
Blanc's chapters appeal rather to the emotions, and 
will be read with satisfaction and profit by those 
not very familiar with the amount of good done in 
this country by individual women and women's or- 
ganizations. For the interest of the book centres 
in its subject, not in its foreign authorship, though 
the latter frequently heightens the relief in which 
things appear. The vivid accounts of repeated 
visits to Hull House, for example, cannot fail to 
awaken the strongest sympathy for Miss Addams's 
noble work. So with regard to other institutions 
in the West and in the East. The generous hos- 
pitality enjoyed by the French visitor at the homes 
of so many distinguished women in the land has 
not, it seems to us, betrayed her into any indiscre- 
tions, though modesty might have prevented some 
of her hostesses from too positively sanctioning all 
of her statements. Neither, do we believe, will 
sensible Americans take umbrage at some instances 
of candid and good-natured disapproval, out-bal- 
anced as they are by the author's unrestrained ad- 
miration for what is good and beautiful. Individ- 
ual readers will no doubt occasionally differ with 
Mme. Blanc in matters of judgment and opinion, 
but her book will give rise to no bitterness of feel- 
ing. Miss Alger contributes to the volume a brief 
biographical sketch of the author, and a strikingly 
good half-tone portrait of the latter is inserted as 
frontispiece. 

The remarkable The ^ e ^ the remarkable Russian 
life-story of a woman, Sonya Kovalevsky, who died 

Russian woman. f(mr yearg ago ftt S tockho]mi ig Qne 

of very uncommon interest. At the age of twenty- 
four she had received a doctor's degree from the 
University of Gottingen ; at thirty-one she was made 
a privat-docent by the University of Stockholm, and 
three years later a professor of mathematics (one 
of the most distinguished of the University's posi- 
tions), thus sweeping away the traditions, preju- 
dices, and customs of centuries. This appointment, 
made when the universities of Germany would not 
even consider the question of permitting women to 
study in them, made a marked sensation in the 
learned world. Still another sensation was produced 



when it was discovered that she was the winner of 
the greatest scientific honor ever gained by a woman, 
one of the greatest, indeed, to which anyone can 
aspire, the Bordin prize from the French Aca- 
demy of Science. The jury of the Academy made 
the award in entire ignorance that the winner was 
a woman, though it doubled the prize (making it 
five thousand francs) on account of the " quite ex- 
traordinary service rendered to mathematical phy- 
sics by this work." These brilliant achievements 
were terminated by Sonya Kovalevsky's death, at 
the early age of forty-one. The event called out 
remarkable manifestations of sympathy and appre- 
ciation. Telegrams of condolence poured in from 
nearly all parts of the civilized world ; cartloads of 
flowers were heaped upon her grave ; Russian women 
resolved to erect a monument on her tomb at Stock- 
holm. Yet Sonya Kovalevsky was the last woman to 
be satisfied with being regarded simply as a kind of 
mental giant, a woman with an unusually developed 
brain. Her emotional nature the hunger of the 
heart for loving and for being loved was as 
strongly marked as her intellectual development. 
There was thus in her life a sort of double nature, 
at war with itself ; and the story of this life is one of 
fascinating, almost tragic, interest. She was never 
happy, even when most honored. Near the close of 
her life she wrote : " It is a great misfortune to have 
a talent for science especially for a woman, who is 
forcibly drawn into a sphere of action where she 
cannot find happiness." She considered her life a 
failure, and said : " Some other human being must 
have received the part of happiness that I longed 
for and dreamed of." This unusual and engross- 
ing life story in part autobiographical has been 
simultaneously published by the Century Co. and 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., the first-named using 
the translation from the Russian made by Miss Isa- 
bel F. Hapgood, and the latter the translation from 
the Swedish made by Louise Von Cossel. 

The fifth volume of the new edition 
of . Poe ' s Complete Works (Stone & 
Kimball) is noteworthy for its reprint 
of " The Journal of Julius Rodman," not before 
included in any collection of Poe's tales. This 
sketch of adventure along the shores of the Missouri 
seems almost to have been written to show what the 
romancer could not do : its incident is meagre, char- 
acterization is entirely lacking, and the style itself 
is hardly to be recognized. The real inspiration of 
the story was doubtless the unpleasant necessity of 
eating. In this volume of the series, and its pre- 
decessor, the promised notes begin to appear. The 
chronological list of the tales will be gladly con- 
sulted by all students of them. An equal amount 
of research has been devoted to showing that Poe 
borrowed his quotations at second-hand, and para- 
phrased much of his material in geography and 
natural history from extant scientific works. The 
value of such scholarship is more questionable. It 
is as if the editor had determined that this luxurious

edition, with its special paper, its portraits, its sym- 
pathetic illustrations, should not delude the public 
into too favorable opinion of the author. Editoral 
criticism nowadays is not depreciative. Imagine 
an edition of Longfellow which should set itself the 
task of indicating that poet's frequent obligation to 
his sources ! But Poe, since the days of Griswold, 
has been doomed to have his fame reduced to its 
lowest terms. Fortunately, the most scathing re- 
buke cannot invalidate the genius of the man who 
is to-day the commonplace of the literary conver- 
sation of Frenchmen with Americans, and whose 
poems were esteemed by Dante Rossetti along with 
Tennyson's. _ 

Mr. Frederic Remington's " Pony 

Tracks " ( Har P er ) embraces fif ^en 
sketches, the drift of which is indi- 

cated by such titles as " Lieutenant Casey's Last 
Scout," " A Rodeo at Los Ojos," " Coaching In 
Chihuahua," " Policing the Yellowstone," " A Merry 
Christmas in a Sibley Tepee," etc. Little need be 
said of Mr. Remington as a delineator of Far 
Western life and types. His studies, descriptive 
and pictorial, of the "Cow-puncher," the "Grea- 
ser," the post soldier, etc., are inimitable in their 
way, and the present work contains some of the 
best things he has given us. The volume is a hand- 
some one, and the seventy odd drawings are done 
in the author's usual spirited, if somewhat over- 
literal, style. We have spoken before of the com- 
ical Muybridge effects of Mr. Remington's more 
miraculous horses. 



Safe advice "The Choice of Books," by Charles 

about books F. Richardson (Lovell, Coryell & 

Co.), is one of those curious produc- 
tions that seem the result of spontaneous genera- 
tion. No date of publishing is given, no hint of 
copyright, no preface, no information concerning 
the author, beyond his name ; while the contents 
have come together mostly from other publications. 
We believe that the book was originally published 
about fifteen years ago, by an author who has since 
that time given us some more original work. If 
such be the case, the book may have a certain right 
to its title, which, if it were a more recent produc- 
tion, would seem to belong to Mr. Frederic Harri- 
son. Whether this be so or not, it might just as 
appropriately have been called "A Choice from 
Books "; for, as is not uncommon nowadays, it con- 
sists almost entirely of quotations. Of the three 
chapters which we have particularly examined, one 
has a sixth original matter, one a fifth, one a fourth. 
In the two hundred pages we have one hundred 
and forty-seven extracts, of which about twenty are 
two pages or more in length, the others being shorter. 
"In this chapter," remarks the author on page 27 
(but the limitation was unnecessary), " I prefer to 
express my own conclusions principally in the words 
of mightier men." Such a practice has decided 
advantages to the reader : it is much easier to recog- 



nize a good passage than to write one, so the reader 
is surer of getting them. This volume, then, has in 
it a great deal that is interesting about books and 
reading, and may be confidently recommended to 
anyone who desires advice on the subject in hand. 
The cover presents a design having one book in the 
centre between three other books. From the inside 
it would appear that these other books must be re- 
spectively by Noah Porter, Hamerton, and Emerson. 



Specimens 
of the humor 
of Russia. 



A fresh and very acceptable addi- 
tion to the " Library of Humor " se- 
ries (imported by Scribner) is the 
" Humor of Russia," admirably translated by E. L. 
Voynich, and furnished with an introduction by S. 
Stepniak. The translator has aimed to give samples 
not only of the best, but of all, Russian humor ; hence 
her list includes, beside the masters, such names as 
Glyeb, Nikolai, V. Slyeptzov, and even Gorbounov. 
As M. Stepniak observes, " there is hardly a name 
worth mentioning that could be added to these." 
Among the selections are Gogol's " Marriage " and 
"A Madman's Diary," Shchedrln's (Saltykov) 
" The Self-Sacrificing Rabbit," Dostoyevsky's " The 
Crocodile," Gorboun6v's " La Traviata," and Step- 
niak's delightful " Story of a Kopeck." The book 
sparkles from end to end with good things, and the 
collection is fairly representative. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Richard Whately wrote his " Historic Doubts Rela- 
tive to Napoleon Buonaparte " (now reprinted by Messrs. 
Putnam's Sons) in 1819, to show that theories of evi- 
dence like those Hume developed in his " Essay on 
Miracles " break down in quite a ridiculous fashion when 
applied even to well-known historical facts, and conse- 
quently are not to be trusted in the criticism of the 
Scripture narratives. As a controversial tract belong- 
ing to the first quarter of the century, its reputation 
for acuteness need not suffer. Its interest is, however, 
purely historical, because its argument has no point in 
the controversy about more recent methods of criticism. 

It is not often that a railroad company, desirous of 
providing a seductive handbook for travellers over its 
tracks, presses into its service so distinguished a man 
of letters as Professor Charles G. D. Roberts. This, 
however, is what has been done by the Dominion At- 
lantic Railway of Nova Scotia, and the resulting book, 
called " The Land of Evangeline," is equally good read- 
ing, whether one travels in Acadia or remains at home. 
It is prettily printed and illustrated, and, we presume, 
distributed free of charge by the company that issues it. 

It is a little curious that the sprightly Frenchwoman 
who writes under the name of " Gyp " should not have 
found favor with English translators. Her bright and 
entertaining stories of up-to-date society have a consid- 
erable degree of literary merit, and are exceptionally 
readable. One of the best of them, " Le Mariage de 
Chiffon," recently published in the "Revue de Paris, "has, 
however, just found not one translator, but two Mr. 
Henri Pene du Bois, who calls his version "A Gallic Girl " 
(Brentano's) ; and " M. L. J.," whose translation is more

literally styled " Chiffon's Marriage " (Lovell). Both 
books are neatly and attractively made. 

A recent issue of " Sound Currency " reprints from 
Mr. W. A. Shaw's " History of Currency " the chapter 
which discusses bimetallism in France, remarking that 
" of all the Quaker artillery that has been used by our 
friends of the Bimetallic League (alias U. S. silver mine 
owners), none has done better service than the alleged 
experience of France." Of course, every well-informed 
student of finance knows that France never had bi- 
metallism in the sense of concurrent circulation of the 
two metals. The superstition is a hard one to kill, and 
" Sound Currency " provides some effective ammuni- 
tion, while its gun is not of the Quaker sort. The semi- 
monthly pamphlets of which this is one are doing ex- 
cellent service in the cause of honest money, and friends 
of that cause will do well to aid in their circulation. 
They are issued by the Sound Currency Committee of 
the New York Reform Club. 

" Maid Marian " and " Crotchet Castle," combined in 
a single volume of the Macmillan series of old-fashioned 
fiction reprinted, will be welcome to all existing Pea- 
cockians, and will probably bring some new members 
to that select guild. The introduction to this volume 
is by Mr. George Saintsbury, who has recently discov- 
ered in Marmontel's " Contes Moraux " what he believes 
to be the model that Peacock had in view when he 
wrote " Headlong Hall," and who has thus brought the 
whole Peacockian series of tales into at least a shadowy 
connection with the literature of that period. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Mr. Andrew Lang is at work upon a biography of 
Lockhart. 

The value of Huxley's estate is a little less than nine 
thousand pounds. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have just added 
" Leighton Court " to their edition of the novels of 
Henry Kingsley. 

" Hypatia " is the first volume of a new " pocket " 
edition of Charles Kingsley's novels, published by 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

The publications of the Century Co. will hereafter be 
issued in England by Messrs. Macmillan & Co., who 
succeed Mr. T. Fisher Unwin in the agency. 

" Richard III." and " Henry V.," the newest volumes 
of the " Temple " Shakespeare (Macmillan), delight the 
sense no less than have done their many predecessors. 

The long looked for "Letters of Matthew Arnold," 
as also the " Letters of Edward Fitzgerald to Fanny 
Kemble," are promised for the present month by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. 

Holger Drachmann, the Danish novelist and poet, a 
sketch of whose life and work appears in this issue of 
THE DIAL, is shortly to be introduced to American 
readers by a translation of one of the best and most 
characteristic of his shorter stories " Paul and Vir- 
ginia of a Northern Zone," to be published by Messrs. 
Way & Williams. 

The International Congress of Journalists, now (Sep- 
tember 13-17) in session at Bordeaux, is particularly 
occupied with discussing the desirability of a Bureau 
Central des Associations de Presse, " for the purpose of 
establishing friendly feelings and common action be- 
tween them in regard to all purely professional ques- 



tions, irrespective of creeds, political opinions, races, 
and nationalities." 

The Hakluyt Society will issue almost immediately a 
volume from the pen of its president, Mr. Clements R. 
Markham, C.B., consisting of a translation of the journal 
kept by Pedro Sarmiento during his voyage to Magel- 
lan's strait in 1579-80, supplemented by documents 
procured from the archives at Madrid. Another of 
the Society's volumes, which, under the joint care of 
Mr. C. A. Gosch and Mr. Miller Christy, deals with the 
Arctic voyages of Jens Munk and James Hall, is in the 
press, and may be expected shortly; while a commence- 
ment has also been made with the printing of Dr. Robert 
Brown's edition of the " Travels of Leo Africanus." 

A meritorious bit of bibliographical work is the " Bib- 
liografia di Pompei, Ercolano e Stahia," by M. Friedrich 
Furchheim. It presents with great exactness the titles 
of the works, both large and small, that have been 
written about the buried cities of Campania, dealing 
with the popular as well as the scientific side. More 
than five hundred titles are given, in one hundred and 
sixteen attractively printed pages; and there is an in- 
troduction of fifteen pages (in Italian), giving a general 
survey of the literature. It is announced that a simi- 
lar bibliography covering Vesuvius, Capri, and other 
points of interest about the Bay of Naples, is in prepara- 
tion. (Naples: F. Furchheim, 59 Piazza dei Martiri.) 

The " Baconian craze " can hardly be said to be ex- 
tinct, since three new books inspired by it are announced 
two of them by lawyers : Mr. T. S. E. Dixon of Chi- 
cago (" Francis Bacon and his Shakespeare," The Sar- 
gent Publishing Co.), and the other by Judge Stotsen- 
berg of Indianapolis. The third is a recent German 
work, a translation of which is promised by Mr. Henry 
Brett. The aim of Mr. Dixon's work is stated to be 
" to present, in a critical exposition, the data (almost 
wholly new) whose consideration has convinced him of 
Bacon's authorship of the plays. The hypothesis is also 
given a crucial test in a novel and striking interpreta- 
tion of the play of ' Julius Csesar,' under the illumina- 
tion afforded by Bacon's acknowledged writings." 

The speech made by Professor Charles Eliot Norton 
at Ashfield, Mass., about three weeks ago, attracted 
much attention by its outspoken strictures upon popu- 
lar education in this country. We reproduce the most 
significant passage of the address: "We speak of popu- 
lar education as the foundation of republican institu- 
tions, and so, indeed, it is. But when we boast that it 
exists in America we delude ourselves. We have indeed 
a very imperfect system of popular education, but of 
true education of the people there is not enough to guar- 
antee the prosperity of the republic. The minds of 
the mass of Americans are still in a prehistoric, or at 
least in a mediaeval stage. It is folly to call a com- 
munity educated in which such an organization as the 
A. P. A. can spread widely. Its members have not 
learned the first, the simplest lesson of good citizenship. 
The records of our recent Legislatures, the records of 
both houses of Congress, give evidence that a very large 
proportion of their members have no claim to be recog- 
nized as educated men. The great body of our news- 
papers in every part of the land not merely display, but 
contribute to, the lack of education of the community. 
The speeches and the acts of many of our most promi- 
nent men, public men, men who have had every advan- 
tage that school and college can afford, give proof that 
their authors belong among the uneducated or the mis- 
educated." 



THE DIAL, 



[Sept. 16, 



ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL, BOOKS. 

In accordance with our established custom, we pre- 
sent herewith our annual list of the more important 
books to be issued during the Fall season by American 
publishers. The list contains nearly seven hundred 
titles, and represents forty-two publishers; the largest 
number of entries for one house is over a hundred, and 
the smallest is one, the average being about seventeen. 
The unusual size of the list makes it necessary to ex- 
clude juvenile books, the most of which appear rather 
late in the season, and the announcement of which is of 
minor literary interest. In all other departments, how- 
ever, the list is believed to be full and representative. 
The proper classification into departments is of course 
the difficult part, and it is made doubly difficult by the 
inadequate or misleading information sometimes sup- 
plied. Books that have not yet been received by THE 
DIAL, and hence that have not yet appeared in its regu- 
lar printed List of New Books, are included among the 
books announced, although in some cases the books may 
have been actually issued by the time this list is pub- 
lished. The books in the list are presumably all new 
new editions not being included unless having new 
form or matter. Some analysis of the list, and com- 
ments upon its more interesting features, may be found 
in the leading editorial article of this issue.

LOWELL. 

With an admirable new Portrait, and rubricated title- 
page and initials. Printed and bound in careful and 
artistic style. 12mo, $1.25.

brought out in a style corresponding to its importance. It contains 
poems not heretofore included in any volume of Mr. Lowell's, and is 
edited by Professor Charles Eliot Norton. It has a fine new portrait of 
Mr. Lowell, selected by his family as the best likeness of him The 
form and style of the volume harmonize with its literary and memorial 
character, and are sufficiently decorative to make a beautiful holiday gift. 

THE WHITTIER YEAR-BOOK. 

Passages from the Verse and Prose of JOHN GREEN- 
LEAF WHITTIER. Carefully printed and tastefully 
bound, with a fine new Portrait of Whittier. 16mo, $1.

By HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. Popular Hol- 
iday Edition. With a fine Portrait and 22 full-page 
Illustrations by FREDERIC REMINGTON. Crown 8vo, 
$2.00. 

This is an artistic but inexpensive edition of a unique poem. Mr. 
Remington's pictures of Indians and Indian life are not drawn from 
fancy but from years of study on the plains of the West. The book has 
a frontispiece portrait of Mr. Longfellow which is regarded as one of 
the best ever made of him, and which shows how he looked at the time 
"Hiawatha" was written. 

THE WISE WOMAN. 

By CLARA LOUISE BURNH AM, author of " Sweet Clover," 
"Miss Bagg's Secretary," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

A host of readers will welcome this announcement of a fresh novel 
from Mrs. Burnham. The leading aim of the story is to discredit and 
sweep away the artificial conventionalities of society, and to promote a 
more sincere, untrammelled social life. 

THE COMING OF THEODORA. 

A Novel. By ELIZA ORNE WHITE, author of "Winter- 
borough," "When Molly Was Six," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

This story promises to create no little discussion. It deals with but 
few persons in a half rural neighborhood. The characters are true to 
life and free from exaggeration ; the incidents are natural, and the in- 
terest is well sustained. Those who have read " Winterborough " know 
how skilfully Miss White reports conversations, and with what ease 
and grace she tells a story. 

CLARENCE. 

A Novel. By BRET HARTE. 16mo, $1.25. 

A spirited novel dealing with the Civil War. President Lincoln fig- 
ures in the story, which is told with the charm of style characteristic 
of Mr. Harte.

By HELEN DAWES BROWN, author of " The Petrie Es- 
tate " and " Two College Girls." With colored cover 
design and other Illustrations. Square 16mo, $1.00.

terest youthful readers, and older people who have not forgotten their 
childhood. It contains fifteen short stories, each devoted to a special 
event or feature of the life of Phoebe when she was about ten years old ; 
and is a companion volume to Miss White's charming book, " When 
Molly Was Six," published last year. 



THE VILLAGE WATCH TOWER. 

By KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN, author of "The Birds' 
Christmas Carol," The Story of Patsy," A Cathe- 
dral Courtship," etc. 16mo, $1.00. 

Several short stories, excellent studies of life in a New England 
village, and, being Mrs. Wiggin's, they are in the highest degree bright, 
witty, sympathetic, and readable. 

ESSAYS IN MINIATURE. 

By AGNES REPPLIER. New Edition. Enlarged, 16mo, 
$1.25. 

MISS REPPLIER'S BOOKS.

Five vols., 16mo, in new binding, $1.25 each; the set, 
$6.25. 

" Her claims to be accounted of the true succession [of essayists] 
Augustan, Georgian, Victorian are incontestable. She has a fine crit- 
ical faculty, and is mistress of a charming style. She has wit, a fund of 
good sense, and humor. . . . There is not one of these essays that is 
not marked by rare sanity of judgment, an invigorating tone, and the 
inspiring grace of humor." Saturday Review (London). 

TOWNSEND HARRIS, FIRST AMERICAN 
ENVOY TO JAPAN. 

By WILLIAM E. GRIFFIS, author of " Japan : In History, 
Folk-Lore, and Art," "The Lily Among Thorns," 
" Brave Little Holland," etc. With Portrait. Crown 
8vo, $2.00. 

The material of Dr. Griffls's book is of very high historic value, and 
is new to Americans, Europeans, and Japanese. It omits what may be 
found in other books which treat of various phases of Japanese life, and 
gives Mr. Harris's journals which contain matter of unique value ; hence 
this work must always stand as one of peculiar interest. 

FRAIL PEOPLE OF THE AIR : 
Excursions into the World of Butterflies. 

By SAMUEL H. SCUDDER, author of " The Butterflies 
of the Eastern United States and Canada," etc. Illus- 
trated. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

Dr. Scudder knows all about butterflies and their life. This book is 
written in a style which the reader will enjoy, and he will have the sat- 
isfaction of knowing that while he is reading a charming book he is fol- 
lowing the lead of a thoroughly competent guide in fascinating excur- 
sions. 

CHRIST'S IDEA OF THE SUPERNATURAL 

By JOHN H. DENISON, D.D. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

Dr. Denison has been engaged for several years on this book, which 
he offers as a contribution to the solution of problems that challenge 
attention. These relate to facts of science, psychic phenomena (includ- 
ing hypnotism), and spiritual experiences. The hypothesis which in- 
cludes all of them he finds in Christ's idea of the supernatural ; and his 
book is not only very well worth reading, but is very readable.

By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS. New Popular Edi- 
tion. Uniform with " The Birds' Christmas Carol." 
With Illustrations. Square 12mo, 75 cents. 
A very attractive and inexpensive edition of one of the most striking 

and touching stories Miss Phelps has ever written.

History for Ready Reference 
and Topical Reading. 

By J. N. LARNED, Ex-President American Library 
Association. 



Giving History on All Topics in the Ex- 
act Words of the Historians Themselves. &ot 
the opinion of one man, hut the thoughts of many 
men, have heen diligently sought out and ar- 
ranged for the " Ready Reference " of the Reader. 

" It supplies what no Encyclopaedia known to me can 
give." MELLEN CHAMBERLAIN. 

" It bids fair to render good historical reading profit- 
able and popular beyond any other work." E. BEN- 
JAMIN ANDREWS. 

" Williston Seminary must, all other academies 
should, have it." WILLIAM GALLAGHER, Principal. 

" It is a most magnificent work in both history and 
literature. The plan is most ingenious, and its execu- 
tion most masterful." HENRY R. PETTENGELL, A.M. 

" It provides a standard History for the busiest age 
the world ever saw, and puts under the eye of the busi- 
est man all that is best from the great historians. To 
read it is to gain breadth of vision and acquaintance 
with the best writers of English. Where the Dictionary 
goes this History should go. The two books come 
nearer making a complete library than any other two 
books in the world." JOHN H. VINCENT, D.D., LL.D.

The recent revival of interest among American and English readers 
in the novels and romances of Dumas and Balzac is rapidly extending 
to their contemporary, the gifted genius who styled herself George Sand. 
Although no complete edition of her books in English has ever appeared, 
their number perhaps precluding it, many of them have been trans- 
lated into English and have had a wide circulation. The best of these 
the masterpieces of George Sand are the books here described. 
With one exception they deal with nature, with country life, with the 
French peasant ; and George Sand's transcendent genius in all these has 
never been rivalled by any of the authors of her land or time. 

.Francz's Parkman's Life and Uncollected Papers. 
THE LIFE OF FRANCIS PARKMAN. By CHARLES H. FABNHAM.

UNCLE REMUS. 

His Songs and his Sayings. By JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS. 

New and revised edition, with 112 Illustrations by A. B. 

FROST. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

It is unnecessary to say anything in praise of Mr. A. B. Frost's unfal- 
tering individuality, his instant realization of types, his quaint and un- 
expected turns of humor, and the constant quality of absolutely true 
and individual pictorial expression of things American. Of the enthu- 
siasm and perfect comprehension and sympathy shown in his 112 draw- 
ings the public can judge, and there can be no doubt that the verdict 
will stamp these pictures as the artist's crowning work in illustration. 
This is the final, the definitive edition of Mr. Harris's masterpiece. 



QUSTAVE FLAUBERT, 

As seen in his Works and Correspondence. By JOHN CHARLES 

TARVER. With Portrait. 8vo, buckram, $4.00. 

No one who is genuinely interested in literature can afford to neglect 
this much-needed and valuable book. It furnishes both a critical bio- 
graphy and, in a sense, an autobiography, for the letters permit a more 
intimate acquaintance with the spirit and aims of the great realist. The 
interesting personages who appear here and there in these pages and 
the author's associations increase the value of one of the most import- 
ant literary biographies of recent years. 

" It is surprising that this extremely interesting correspondence has 
not been Englished before. " London Alhenceum. 

" This handsome volume is welcome. ... It merits a cordial recep- 
tion if for no other reason than to make a large section of the English 
public more intimately acquainted with the foremost champion of art 
for art's sake. . . . The letters are admirably translated, and in the 
main the book is written with skill and v erve. " London Academy. 



THE BEGINNINGS OF WRITING. 

By WALTER J. HOFFMAN, M.D., of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution. A new volume in the 
Anthropological Series, edited by Prof. FREDERICK STARR. 
Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

Professor Hoffman, one of the most successful workers in the field of 
American ethnology, presents the first steps in the development of 
writing from tangible reminders like quipus and wampum belts, through 
picture writing to phonetic writing with an alphabet. These first steps 
are described especially as they are shown among North American 
tribes. Our native peoples made much use of reminders ; they drew 
truly expressive pictures ; they developed complicated systems of pic- 
tography ; and some peoples of Mexico and Central America were pass- 
ing from the use of idiograms to phonograms. This transition period is 
most interesting. In clear and popular language Professor Hoffman 
sets forth the latest results of scientific study, and his references are 
illustrated with many helpful pictures. 



THE PSYCHOLOGY OF NUMBER, 

And its Applications to Methods of Teaching Arithmetic. By 
JAMES A. McLELLAN, A.M., LL.D., Principal of the On- 
tario School of Pedagogy, Toronto, and JOHN DEWEY, 
Ph.D., Head Professor of Philosophy in the University of 
Chicago. International Education Series, Vol. 33. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

. It is believed that this work will supply a special want. There is no 
subject taught in the elementary scho'ols that taxes the teacher's re- 
sources as to methods and devices to a greater extent than arithmetic, 
and none that is more dangerous to the pupil in the way of deadening 
his mind and arresting its development, if bad methods are used. The 
authors of this book have presented in an admirable manner the psy- 
chological view of number, and shown its applications to the correct 
methods of teaching the several arithmetical processes. 



THE STARK MUNRO LETTERS. 

Being a Series of Twelve Letters written by J. STARK MUNRO, 
M.B., to his Friend and Fellow-Student, Herbert Swanbo- 
rough, of Lowell, Mass., 1881-1884. Edited and arranged 
by A. CONAN DOYLE, author of " Round the Red Lamp," 
" The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," etc. With 8 full- 
page Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This original and dramatic story presents fresh types, extraordinary 
situations, and novel suggestions with a freshness and vigor which show 
that the romancer's heart was in his work. How far certain incidents 
of the story are based upon personal experiences it is impossible to say, 
but the unflagging interest and unexpected phases of the romance are 
no less in evidence than the close personal relations established between 
author and reader.

ries " translated by SUSAN E. BLOW. With 48 full-page 
Illustrations. Vol. 31, International Education Series. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The increased interest in kindergarten work and the demand for a 
clearer exposition of Froebel's philosophy than has heretofore appeared 
have made a new version of the " Mother Play " an imperative neces- 
sity. No one is better equipped for such a work than Miss Blow, as her 
late book, " Symbolic Education," has attested. In the " Mottoes and 
Commentaries" the original pictures have been faithfully reproduced, 
except where bad drawing rendered slight changes necessary. It is an 
attractive volume of a convenient size, and a book of specific value to 
mothers as well as to teachers of every grade. It will be followed 
shortly by another volume containing the songs and games. 



NOT COUNTING THE COST. 

By TASMA. No. 175, Town and Country Library. 12mo, 

paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

This novel seems likely to be accounted the most ambitious work of 
its talented and successful author. The literary value of her work has 
been abundantly recognized, but " Not Counting the Cost " is certain 
to add to her reputation and increase her popularity. 



OUT OF DUE SEASON. 

A Mezzotint. By ADELINE SERGEANT. No. 176, Town and 
Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 
The development of Miss Sergeant's power is well shown in this 

strong and significant study of life and character.

A Novel. By RHODA BROUGHTON, author of " Nancy," "A 
Beginner," etc. No. 177, Town and Country Library. 12mo,

The new story by this popular author will be found full of human 

interest, agreeable, and entertaining. 



THE WAITER'S MOU'. 

By BRAM STOKER. 16mo, cloth, 75 cents. 
This is a singularly dramatic story of the English coast, worked out 
with excellent command of forceful motives and an abundant power of 
graphic description.

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 

(Obiit October 7, 189/ f .) 

He that so often bade us smile, 
What later whim hath bid us weep ? 

Or was it some new jest, that while 
He jested he should fall asleep ? 

His mirth, we now remember, stood 
Next neighbor always to regret. 

Responding to his merriest mood, 
We often found our lashes wet. 

With courtly quip, and kindly scoff, 
And laughter never long or loud, 

His fun was not the common stuff, 
His fancy fooled not for the crowd; 

But, Humor's mild aristocrat, 

He bowed him through these busy days, 
Half wondering what the world was at, 

And shrewdly smoothing it with praise. 

And now he lives but in his page, 

Where wit and wisdom are comprised, 

The gentlest breeding of the age 
Most graciously epitomized. 

CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS. 



THE ITALIAN NOVEL OF THE YEAR. 

One of the foremost books of the year in Italy,, 
and certainly the foremost novel, has been Girolamo 
Rovetta's " La Baraonda." Signer Rovetta has been 
held, for some time, to be one of the cleverest of 
the Verists ; but he has done nothing which has 
met with the amount of attention bestowed on " La 
Baraonda." There are particular reasons for this- 
The novel is entertaining as literature, but it is also 
striking as an epitome of the precise social, political, 
and moral crisis through which Italy is now pass- 
ing. One may go further, and say that Signer Ro- 
vetta's book gives the measure of a crisis in the evo- 
lution of the whole Latin race a crisis than which 
it has known none more serious. This means much ; 
and it explains the mark which the book has made r 
and the fact that thoughtful minds should have oc- 
cupied themselves so much with it. 

"Baraonda" is an untranslatable word. It is 
nearer in meaning to the French " Debacle " than 
to any work that we have in English. It signifies 
a crumbling to pieces, a going down, a breaking up, 
a foundering. The main motif of Signer Rovetta's 
novel is the career of one Cantasirena, formerly 
friend and associate of Giuseppe Garibaldi in the 
liberation of Italy, and now become, by a gradual 



170

[Oct. 1, 



descent through devious ways, a bombastic, melli- 
fluent, tireless, and an utterly unscrupulous promoter 
of bubble companies. This character is a type, a 
creation. It is drawn with a masterly hand. Can- 
tasirena has a niece, who has beauty and a voice, 
and whose moral sense is about what might be ex- 
pected from the precepts and practices current in 
the household where she has been brought up, where 
friends under one pretext or another are dexter- 
ously relieved of ten-franc notes to pay waiting cabs. 
Acquaintances and strangers are manipulated for 
loans that are never paid back, and the air is per- 
petually filled either with the infuriated denuncia- 
tions of ancient dupes, or the orotund discourses 
of the great Canasirena drawing new ones into the 
nets of countless associations and societies that spring 
into being, fully organized, from hour to hour, in 
his fertile brain. The niece succeeds in marrying 
the Duke of Casalbara, an elderly viveur, but the 
possessor of an ancient name and of untarnished 
reputation and honor. The end is to be expected. 
The " Zio Matteo " uses the Casalbara influence to 
float a wild-cat scheme on a gigantic scale, the gov- 
ernment lends its support, and we have the whole 
tragi-comedy of the Panama scandals, and of the 
Giolitti and Banca Romana infamies, unrolled be- 
fore us. 

Signor Rovetta wastes no time in pointing morals; 
but he goes his way, and says his say, with a cynical 
frankness that drives the nail in to the head. The 
book must indeed be a sad one to that generation 
of Italians who, high hopes and lofty enthusiasms 
burning in their souls, gathered about the noble 
spirits that fought with their blood, and toiled with 
their brain, for a United Italy. Where is the pure 
and ardent patriotism, where is the devotion to the 
most unselfish ideals, of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Cavour ? 
What has become of these things, through which 
Italy was united, in the Italy of to-day ? Signor 
Rovetta has allowed them to survive in one charac- 
ter of his latest book, that of the old soldier who, hav- 
ing lost his leg in the Garibaldian wars, now stumps 
it on a wooden one, but whose faith has never 
dimmed ; who lives on in the service of the unspeak- 
able rascal and charlatan Cantasirena, in candid 
ignorance and innocence of all that passes beneath 
his eyes, still ingenuously and heroically glazing in 
that great past ware of exalted patriotism, which to 
Cantasirena is a magniloquent catch-word to entice 
victims mad with the desire to get rich, and faith- 
fully, from the bottom of his honest heart, crying 
" Viva 1'Italia ! " in response to that individual's 
sonorous harangues. One grows fond of the old sol- 
dier. What has been debased into a cloak for every 
humbuggery and corruption in others is still a great 
and disinterested sentiment to his simple soul. He 
alone purifies a little the atmosphere in which Sig- 
nor Rovetta's knaves and fools and dupes and trick- 
sters move and have their vulgar and sordid being. 

It has been said that " La Baraonda " derives its 
value from the accuracy with which it has caught 
the social, economical, and political phase through 



which modern Italy is now passing ; through which, 
in a wider sense, the whole Latin race is now passing. 
No one who has studied the two countries can fail to 
have been struck with the similarity of social phenom- 
ena there occurring. The Panama and Giolitti scan- 
dals did not come so near together for nothing. They 
are symptoms of deep-lying causes. The pressure 
of the new industrial conditions, the money-fever 
that has spread over the world with the enormous 
extension that commercial enterprise has taken on, 
are having an effect upon the Latin peoples which 
presents some very curious aspects. It may be said, 
roughly generalizing a very complex consensus of 
phenomena, that money looked upon in the posi- 
tion which it has and as the power which it is in 
modern life and the Latin genius, are incompat- 
ible entities. Modern industrialism, in its essence, 
tends to create material needs in the individual, 
that it may supply them. That is its whole process. 
The race which develops these needs in the greatest 
number, and is most dependent upon their gratifi- 
cation, is the Anglo-Saxon. The uses to which the 
Englishman, left entirely to himself, puts wealth, 
and the uses to which the Italian, or Frenchman, 
also quite uninfluenced, would naturally put it, are 
different from the root up. The conception of lux- 
ury, in the Latin race, has never been separated 
from aesthetic conceptions. Money has meant art, 
in some form or other; in different words, it has 
the satisfaction of a certain inborn desire for that 
sort of grace-harmony in the surroundings which 
affects the spirit rather than the flesh. There is 
no denying that we of the English-speaking race 
are more materialistic. Money means, to us, before 
it means anything else, bodily comforts : the com- 
forts under the guarding shield of which all the nat- 
ural processes of sleep, digestion, etc., go on most 
easily and perfectly. Perhaps it has not been suf- 
ficiently considered how ethically dangerous such a 
view of comfort might become, if pushed to the ex- 
treme. However this may be, it has certainly acted, 
so far, upon the races with whom it is not indi- 
genous as a very perilous dissolvent and disinte- 
grator. 

Exacting in the aesthetic direction, the Latin peo- 
ples have hitherto been content with comparatively 
little materially. But now that the rage for ma- 
terial possessions has infected them, their more sen- 
sitively-responsive nervous organization has been 
led to exaggerate the desire into a sort of frenzy. 
They are not moving along a line natural to them, 
and they have lost their balance. 

There never was a sadder, a more ignominious, 
collapse of great dreams, noble ideals, than that 
which within this generation has befallen Italy. Its 
tottering financial condition has aided the causes 
just outlined to give impetus to a speculative mania 
that invades, in some shape, all classes of society. 
Bearers of historic names who formerly would have 
supported reduced circumstances in dignified retire- 
ment, secure in their station, and disdainful of ad- 
vantages of the sort that any parvenu possessed of 



1895.]

gold could purchase, now parting clandestinely with 
the treasures of priceless family collections to make 
a figure in the general display ; ministers lending 
the prestige of their official station to float rotten 
financial enterprises ; these are characters that 
many French and Italian novelists have rendered 
familiar to us. In " La Baraonda " we see how the 
" little folk " rush in likewise, how they invest their 
savings feverishly in any scheme whatever, regard- 
less of consequences. 

It has been said that this is a sad book. It is 
certainly one that awakens thought, and gives rise 
to many questions. What is the outcome of this 
crisis to be to Italy, to the Latin race in general? 
Are we confronting one of those social cataclysms 
in which a race literally, so far as national cohe- 
siveness is concerned, crumbles away in the shock 
of contact with another race capable of adapting 
itself more easily and completely to the conditions 
of existence of the moment ? Or will there be pro- 
cesses of adjustment, the great agility and supple- 
ness of the Latin genius enabling it to take from 
the new conditions what it can digest, and to reject 
the rest ? No cultivated reader will lay down " La 
Baraonda," with its keen observation, its photo- 
graphic characterization, without the sensation that 
it defines a critical situation, and is quite worthy of 
giving pause to the student of social manifestations. 

ALINE GORREX. 



THE DECADENCE OF A SCHOLAR. 



At the seventh unsuccessful application for a po- 
sition, Thomson lost heart. Professorships were 
no longer plums, ready to fall into the hands of him 
who had most conscientiously prepared himself. 
The fact was plain that since Thomson's departure 
for those subsequent hard years of study in Ger- 
many, conditions had arisen in his own country 
which involved a political idea. Public sentiment 
was against scepticism in any form ; it was not 
enough that one should be a quietist in his worship 
of unusual and Utopian theories : he must give as- 
surance that his study ran resolutely into the chan- 
nel of popular and conservative thought. In short, 
without any will of one's own, truth, to be popular, 
must coincide with the dominant belief. 

Thomson knew that the truth for which he had 
labored was of no kin to the ideas in vogue. At 
first, this consciousness rather amused than troubled 
him. Recollections of German lecture-rooms were 
fresh, in whose atmosphere of catholicity and unbias 
the contraries of these qualities of mind were un- 
realities, hardly to be taken seriously. As time 
gradually opened to him the order of things in his 
native land, what he had at first termed provincial 
began to assume the royal value of sovereignty. 
The people, the popular will, above all the popular 
level, were factors which had had small place in his 



scientific vigils. German imperialism had lent its 
authority to her learned men of the universities. 
As in France, and to a less degree in England, 
Thomson had followed others of his kind into un- 
questioning allegiance to authorities of the book. 

Here, all was changed. There seemed to be no 
authorities. Clear and independent conceptions 
the scientific point of view had been allowed a 
brief utterance, only to be silenced by ridicule and 
misappreciation. When Thomson left for Ger- 
many five years before, the light shone bright ahead. 
He remembered standing, outward bound, on the 
prow of the great liner, the spray stinging his face 
as the Titanic iron wedge rose and ploughed into the 
sea. A break in the clouds let down the imprisoned 
silver light to flood the horizon. " Is it not," he 
thought, " pure science clear truth, that needs no 
guardian or embellishment which is to bring light 
to my land, where war has been, and ignorance, 
and all uncharitableness? " There could be no 
doubt. He would return with some message from 
wise and sober Germany. 

What a child-like dream ! Politics recked not 
of truth or sobriety. The last letter from an edu- 
cational Power, announcing Thomson's unfitness for 
the position, contained these words : " Whilst I 
have no doubt of your ability to lecture along cer- 
tain lines, the question of opinion, of political tim- 
bre, is of more importance to us than adroitness in 
special work. Indeed, I take the liberty of an older 
man, in advising you (who have your work to do 
here) that the people care very little for German 
training in your subject. Whether the fact is to be 
deplored or not, such training is rather a hindrance 
than a help to your influence and advancement." 

The friendship of the letter was unmistakable. 
Equally so was the tide in Thomson's affairs which 
bore him mute and helpless from his moorings. His 
old enemy, Popularity, met him at every turn, and 
he read in the kindly letter from the President a 
reflection of popular desire. 

At this scattering of Thomson's forces, he felt 
himself bound to lay hands on something that was 
fast in general esteem. As our ablest critic has said, 
" Philistia has its aesthetic rituals and pageantry "; 
and Thomson was drawn to them. Already the 
special workers, his old colleagues, seemed high 
priests of Phariseeism, and the careful cultures of 
remote and independent inquiry took on the form 
of curious exotics. His contributions to print ap- 
peared to belong to the poetry of science rather than 
to actual life. Then came the corollary, biting and 
poisonous to his self-esteem : that truth, for which 
he had renounced the world, and which was to make 
him free, lacked the first quality of truth uni- 
versal application. 

Doubt is a tragedy with some men ; it was with 
Thomson. Fast upon his years of firm resolve, of 
puritan training, of simple and reverent life, there 
crowded brutal moments of vulgarity. His friends 
made money. An old acquaintance, who never 
worried over truth or untruth, was high in political 



172 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



life. His good-natured condescension to Thomson 
had indeed caused the first serious conflict of ideas 
in the brain of the careful student. Whether right 
or wrong, this man, whom Thomson had been wont 
to regard with little respect, had influence and 
power. He represented thousands of human beings. 
Thomson felt that his own clientele could be spelled 
by a capital Ego, or at best by a few others like 
himself. Herein lay the tragedy ; for he was hu- 
man, and selfishness to him was inhuman. 

It was at this point that he lost heart. " After 
all," he said to his old university chum, " can a man 
rise higher than his source ? " and quickly denying 
the affirmation of his friend, " John Tyndall was 
sure of a response somewhere when he played the 
seer in his essay ' On the Scientific Use of the Im- 
agination.' Is there in all the land a want repre- 
sented by this work of mine ? The source of power 
desire is in myself alone ; that of the politician 
is the desires of others. I cannot rid myself of the 
idea that the men who have stayed at home, even 
those of no training, as we say, know people, grasp 
these human conditions, are better men for the place, 
than you or I." 

" It is for us to create new wants," said his friend. 

" I am not so certain of that. A man should be 
the product of his time, and the days of the seer 
are numbered." 

u. 

A year went round, and the period of opportun- 
ity again arrived. It seemed to Thomson that the 
twelve months had been worse than lost : he had 
not stood still, but had gone backward. Upon his 
table lay a pile of rejected MSS. and unapplauded 
addresses. Science was indeed a stern mistress. 
The boy who used to blacken his boots rode by on a 
spirited horse. There were cards announcing the 
marriage of the Politician and the girl upon whom 
Thomson had been dependent for an occasional 
word of good cheer. In the morning's mail there 
was a letter from an old friend of his father's. " I 
have watched," the letter ran, ' ; your career with 
interest and some anxiety, knowing full well that 
prolonged study abroad would tend to unfit you for 
the practical work ahead. Your habits of quiet 
study and reserve, your intense application to the 
hidden labor of the lamp, are un-American and un- 
popular. There may come a time when our civil- 
ization will demand such sacrifices. To-day, how- 
ever, it is the man who knows not so much, maybe 
and who wears his knowledge broadly and with 
a smile, that finds his place and audience. Close 
your books ; go out among men ; meet the politi- 
cians, noting how they toil and spin and flourish. 
Above all, do not take yourself so seriously. Your 

theories may be true enough ; but only a sense of 

i p . 

humor can save you from too quixotic a service to 

them. . . Let me say to you, in closing, that sooner 
or later a man must meet the people on their own 
terms. He must be of actual use to some community 
if he ask for its support." 



Thomson groaned. " I pledged my word in Ger- 
many that I would teach nothing that I did not be- 
lieve to be the truth : and now, with Pilate, must I 
ask, 'What is truth'?" 

The bell rang, and a telegram was brought in. 
Thomson read : " The professorship in Col- 
lege is vacant. Cultivate Wilcox and you may get 
it." Signed by his own friend. 

Wilcox was the Politician whose marriage was 
announced. He was not only a financial patron of 
the college ; he was a director of its policy, which 
was narrow and closely sectarian. 

How great was Thomson's fall when he did 
eventually " cultivate " this man, obtain the posi- 
tion, and sink by slow degrees to the level of his 
environment ! He has been heard to say that as a 
people we were nearer truth in Jefferson's day than 
in the present year of grace. Whatever may be 
argued in Thomson's behalf, his decadence is now 
complete. He is a laudator temporis acti.

LOUIS PASTEUR. 



Louis Pasteur was born December 22, 1822, at 
Dole, and died September 28, 1895, in his suburban 
home near Paris. His death, which was not un- 
expected, came as the result of an apoplectic stroke, 
and was painless. He was not, like Huxley, Tyn- 
dall, and Helmholtz to name the greatest men 
whom science has lost of late a writer of books 
that were known to the general public ; but his sci- 
entific work was widely familiar, and popular report 
can hardly have over-estimated its value to man- 
kind. We think of him first and foremost as a bac- 
teriologist, and his studies of such subjects as the 
silkworm disease, anthrax, fowl cholera, and rabies, 
have proved immensely fruitful in practical results. 
Huxley's statement that the discoveries of Pasteur 
had more than made up to the French people the 
five milliards of the war indemnity is probably 
well within the truth. And of even greater sig- 
nificance is the fact that, thanks to his efforts, hy- 
drophobia has been robbed of its terrors, and added 
to the rapidly growing list of human diseases that 
are amenable to treatment. He ranks among the 
greatest benefactors of mankind known to all his- 
tory, and it will not be easy to do adequate honor 
to his memory.

CRIME IN PROHIBITION STATES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Professor Frederick Starr, in his review of Haycraft's 
" Darwinism and Race Progress " in THE DIAL, gives 
circulation to some statements that can, I think, be 
safely challenged. When he says that " In Maine we 
find insanity, pauperism, crime, on the increase at an 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



173 



abnormally large rate," he gives sanction to an untruth, 
if we can believe the statements of representative men 
of that State. Such assertions have often been made 
by the enemies of prohibition, without any warrant from 
official and authorized sources. 

Professor Starr also makes a quotation to the effect 
that in Kansas " there were more prisoners in its peni- 
tentiary and county jails, in proportion to population, 
in 1890 than there were in 1880," with the inference 
that prohibition had caused an increase of crime. As a 
resident of Kansas during the years mentioned, and 
until within the past two years, and having some knowl- 
edge of the facts, I ask for proof of what I believe is a 
falsehood. The warden of the penitentiary of Kansas 
reported in 1890 almost the same number of convicts 
in the penitentiary as there were in 1882, the year pro- 
hibition took effect; although the population of the State 
had increased some half a million. I have not the 
official figures as to the inmates of county jails, but I 
believe they will show the untruthfulness of the state- 
ment " that Kansas has a larger ratio of prisoners to 
population than its neighboring States." It seems re- 
markable that so intelligent a people as the residents 
of Maine and Kansas and Iowa should advocate a pol- 
icy that increases crime and vice. 

I would not have felt like noticing these statements, 
had not Professor Starr said that the book under re- 
view " contains far too much of good hard common 
sense " to " meet an enthusiastic reception." If its 
statements on other questions are as unreliable as those 
on prohibition, it is unworthy of the notice of honest 
people. D. C. MILKER. 

Chicago, Sept. 13, 1895. 

[The authorities quoted or used by Mr. Haycraf t 
appear to be two Rathbone and Fanshawe's 
4i Liquor Legislation in the United States and Can- 
ada," and the United States Census of 1880 and 
1890. I have assumed the accuracy of quotation 
and figures, and have not compared our author with 
the original authorities. After showing from insane 
asylum statistics that insanity in Maine is not nota- 
bly decreasing, Mr. Haycraf t presents Census figures 
showing an abnormal increase in the prison popu- 
lation of that State. The statement Mr. Milner ob- 
jects to in reference to Kansas is based upon the 
Census figures, and ends as follows : " Of all the 
neighboring States, Kansas had in 1890 absolutely 
the largest ratio of prisoners to population." If 
Mr. Milner can show that the Census is inaccurate, 
or that Mr. Haycraf t has used it wrongly, he has a 
good case. In this country we constantly depend 
upon the Census for comparisons, and must forgive 
a British writer who does the same. I have not 
looked up the figures, because the statements appear 
to me to be reasonable. By prohibiting the sale of 
strong drink, the drunkard is not made over. It 
is very doubtful if the man who would be a sot in 
Illinois is likely to be a good citizen in Iowa. No 
one deplores the use of liquor or the crimes done 
under its influence more than myself. But the 
would -be -drunkard is the same weak, unstable, 
viciously-inclined creature in Kansas that he would 
be in Texas, and probably full as harmful. THE 
REVIEWER.] 



A CORRECTION FROM PROFESSOR NORTON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the report of my address at Ashfield from which 
you copied some words into your issue of Sept. 16, there 
was an error which I should be glad to have corrected. I 
did not say, " We have a very imperfect system of popu- 
lar education" but " We have a very imperfect system of 
popular instruction." My point was to make a wide dis- 
tinction between education and instruction. So long as 
the speech was having a mere ephemeral existence in 
the daily newspapers, it did not seem worth while to 
make the correction ; but now that you have cited the 
passage in THE DIAL, and, so doing, given to it a chance 
of longer life, the correction seems needed.

THE CRAZE FOR WRONG SPELLING. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

At different times I have noticed in the newspapers 
poems of good quality, marred only by the fault of bad 
spelling, intentional bad spelling. In a recent speci- 
men that I have examined, nearly every line contains 
misspelled words. The syntax from first to last is fault- 
less, with the exception of the omission of words neces- 
sary to the sense, which are left to be understood; and 
this is allowable. The wrong spelling appears to be 
intended to represent vulgar pronunciation ; the writer, 
strangely enough, seeming to believe that these faults 
in some way add to the value or the interest of his 
work, but how or why will never be known to anyone 
but himself. 

Of course, when to wrong spelling and vulgar pronun- 
ciation are added " slum " English expressions, and igno- 
rant grammatical distortions of any kind, the evil be- 
comes so much the more grievous. There is no conceivable 
temptation that can justify the use of orthoepic, ortho- 
graphic, or syntactical irregularities, unless it be a de- 
sire for picturesqueness such, for instance, as is found 
in the Scottish dialect, or the dialect which Tennyson 
musically portrays; and perhaps in poems intended to 
hold up to ridicule brother villains other than versifiers 
the versifier being sufficiently damned by his own 
act. The common American half-dialect which is found 
in most of these poems is altogether unpicturesque and 
unbeautiful; and no attempt to make poetry of it has 
ever resulted in anything but disaster. Dialect poems 
are, of course, sometimes so good as to be still good, 
though defaced in this manner ; as are some of the 
pieces of the well-meaning James Whitcomb Riley, at 
present the chief offender, and, strange to say, a poet 
of considerable strength, who has hosts of misguided 
imitators, weak, weaker, and weakest. If wisdom is 
to be drawn from the mind of a humble man, may not 
humble good English well be put into his mouth to 
make his words respectable too? 

Our English language is so simple that no one who 
can read is excusable if he utter grammatical absurd- 
ities every time he opens his mouth; and, it is needless 
to say, his words ought never to be repeated if he do. 

Many a good poet would redeem himself, and many 
a grievous one greatly mitigate himself, by spelling 
rightly. They should respect the English language, 
not degrade and deface it.

MORE FITZGERALD LETTERS.* 

Little need be said in the way of general 
praise or characterization of the sprightly little 
volume of " Letters of Edward FitzGerald to 
Fanny Kemble." The premier translator is al- 
ways admirable, whether in verse or prose, and 
his good wine needs no bush. The letters, rang- 
ing chronologically from the middle of 1871 
to within three weeks of the writer's death in 
1883, form a nearly continuous series ; and, ex- 
cept a few of the later ones already printed in 
the "Letters and Literary Remains," they will 
be new to most American readers. Perhaps the 
best of the book, as of its monumental prede- 
cessor, is the constant suggestion of a singularly 
engaging personality a sort of happy mean, 
as one may guess, between the recluse Gray and 
Mr. Rickman, Charles Lamb's famous " pleas- 
ant hand." Like Elia's friend, Mr. FitzGer- 
ald was " hugely literate," without conceit of 
scholarship ; " up to anything," without the 
pitiful assumption of aloofness from current 
pursuits and interests. Mrs. Kemble was a 
congenial spirit and his life-long friend ; and 
he chats with her unreservedly of his daily do- 
ings, his reading, his friends, his literary and 
other likes and dislikes the latter never very 
violent, for " dear old Fitz," as his familiars 
called him, was anything but a good hater. 
Like his prime favorite Mme. de Sevigne (who, 
he says somewhere, " with Crabbe and John 
Wesley seem to be my great hobbies"), he 
gives his pen the loose rein ; and, indeed, one de- 
tects in his style an echo, sometimes playfully 
deliberate, of the fluent stream of alternate 
sense and sportiveness, depth and badinage, 
that marks the epistles of the incomparable 
mistress of the " Rochers." It is in a letter 
of 1875 that we find him first occupied with 
Mme. de Sevigne. " I should like," he says, 
"to send you a Bouquet of Extracts"; and 
a year later he runs on, quite in the Sevigne 
manner : 

" * Ho I parlons d'autres choses ma Fille,' as my dear 
Se'vigne' says. She now occupies Montaigne's place in 
my room: well worthily: she herself a lover of Mon- 
taigne, and with a spice of his free thought and speech 
in her. I am sometimes vext I never made her ac- 
quaintance till last year: but perhaps it was as well to 
have such an acquaintance reserved for one's latter 
years. The fine Creature ! much more alive to me than

most friends I should like to see her Rochers ' in 
Brittany." 

The letters are freely sprinkled with literary 
and personal allusions little asides mostly, 
thrown in haphazard amid the general stream 
of chat. An interesting series of references to 
Carlyle, or rather to his unexpectedly outspoken 
biographer, may be quoted without comment. 
Shortly after Carlyle's death, Mr. FitzGerald 
writes : 

" I was touched with the account of Carlyle's simple 
Obsequies among his own Kinsfolk, in the place of his 
Birth it was fine of him to settle that so it should be. 
I am glad that Mr. Froude is charged with his Biog- 
raphy: a Gentleman, as well as a Scholar and < Writer 
of Books,' who will know what to leave unsaid as well 
as what to say." 

In a letter of the following month, we read : 

" You have, I suppose, the Carlyle Reminiscences : 
of which I will say nothing except that, much as we out- 
siders gain by them, I think that, on the whole, they 
had better have been kept unpublished for some while 
at least. As also thinks Carlyle's Niece, who is sur- 
prised that Mr. Froude, whom her Uncle trusted above 
all men for the gift of Reticence, should have been in 
so much hurry to publish what was left to his Judgment 
to publish or no." 

The Biography is more favorably judged : 

" The Carlyle Reminiscences ' had long indisposed 
me from taking up the Biography. But when I began, 
and as I went on with that, I found it one of the most 
interesting of Books: and the result is that I not only 
admire and respect Carlyle more than ever I did: but 
even love him, which I never thought of before. . . . 
His indifference to her [Mrs. Carlyle's] sufferings seems 
to me rather because of Blindness than Neglect; and I 
think his Biographer has been even a little too hard 
upon him on the score of Selfish disregard of her. In- 
deed, Mr. Norton (of Cambridge) wrote to me that he 
looked on Froude as something of an lago toward his 
hero in respect of all he had done for him. The pub- 
lication of the Reminiscences is indeed a mystery to me : 
for I should have thought that, even in a mercantile 
point of view, it would indispose others, as me it did, 
to the Biography. But lago must have bungled in his 
work so far as I, for one, am concerned, if the result is 
such as I find it or unless I am very obtuse indeed. 
So I tell Mr. Norton, who is about to edit Carlyle's 
Letters to Emerson, and whom I should not like to see 
going to his work with such an ' Animus ' toward his 
Fellow-Editor." 

The month following, Mr. FitzGerald contin- 
ues : 

" Yes ; you must read Froude's Carlyle above all 
things, and tell me if you do not feel as I do about it. 
Professor Norton persists in it that I am proof against 
Froude's invidious insinuations simply because of my 
having known Carlyle. But how is it that I did not 
know, that Carlyle was so good, grand, and even love- 
able, till I read the Letters which Froude now edits ? 
I regret that I did not know what the Book tells us 
while Carlyle was alive; that I might have loved him 
as well as admired him. But Carlyle never spoke of 
himself in that way: I never heard him advert to his

Works and Fame, except one day he happened to men- 
tion ' About the time when Men began to talk of me.' " 

Touching the Carlyle-Emerson Letters, Mr. 
FitzGerald says : 

" Professor Norton had sent me his Carlyle-Emerson 
Correspondence, which we [ himself and Mr. Aldis 
Wright] conned over together, and liked well on either 
side. Carlyle should not have said (and still less Nor- 
ton printed !) that Tennyson was a ' gloomy ' Soul, nor 
Thackeray ' of inordinate appetite,' neither of which say- 
ings is true : nor written of Lord Houghton as a ' Robin 
Redbreast ' of a man. I shall wait very patiently till 
Mudie sends me Jane Carlyle where I am told there 
is a word of not unkindly toleration of me ; which, if one 
be named at all, one may be thankful for." 

Among the American authors alluded to 
here and there in the letters is Mr. Lowell 
who " may do," thinks the writer, " for En- 
glish authors something as Ste. Beuve has done 
for the French." Apropos of Mr. Leslie Steph- 
en's " Hours in a Library," Mr. FitzGerald 
says : 

" Another book of the kind Lowell's ' Among my 
Books ' is excellent also : perhaps with more Genius 
than Stephen; but on the other hand not so temperate, 
judicious, or scholarly in taste." 

Mr. FitzGerald is always refreshingly frank 
as to his own (sometimes a little whimsical) 
literary preferences. After bestowing a page 
of praise on a little street song, " Le Bon 
Pasteur" which he once heard sung in Paris 
to a barrel-organ accompaniment, and which 
he confesses " touched me more than any of 
Beranger's most beautiful things," he goes on 
to say: 

"I have been trying again at another Great Artist's 
work which I never could care for at all, Goethe's 
Faust, in Hayward's Prose Translation. Hayward 
quotes from Goethe himself, that, though of course 
much of a Poem must evaporate in a Prose Translation, 
yet the Essence must remain. Well; I distinguish as 
little of that Essential Poetry in the Faust now as when 
I first read it longer ago than < Le Bon Pasteur,' and 
in other subsequent attempts. I was tempted to think 
this was some Defect great Defect in myself: but 
a note at the end of the Volume informs me that a 
much greater Wit than I was in the same plight even 
Coleridge. ... I find a great want of Invention and 
Imagination both in the Events and Characters." 

A comparison more flattering to Beranger 
than the one above noted is made in a previous 
letter. On the question whether the French 
chansonnier or Burns were the " Greater Gen- 
ius," the writer concludes : 

" I can 't say; but with all my Admiration for about 
a Score of the Frenchman's almost perfect Songs, I 
would give all of them up for a Score of Burns's Coup- 
lets, Stanzas, or single Lines scattered among those 
quite imperfect Lyrics of his. Be*ranger, no doubt, was 
The Artist; which still is not the highest Genius wit- 
ness Shakespeare, Dante, ^Eschylus, Calderon, to the 



contrary. Burns assuredly had more Passion than the 
Frenchman ; which is not Genius either, but a great 
Part of the Lyric Poet still. What Be*ranger might 
have been, if born and bred among Banks, Braes, and 
Mountains, I cannot tell: Burns had that advantage 
over him. And then Highland Mary to love, amid the 
heather, as compared to Lise the Grisette in a Parisian 
suburb ! . . . Some thirty years ago A. Tennyson went 
over Burns's Ground in Dumfries. When he was one 
day by Doon-side ' I can 't tell how it was, Fitz, but 
I fell into a Passion of Tears ' and A. T. not given to 
the melting mood at all." 

The writer's love of fun peeps out pleasantly 
in most of the letters. An amusing personage, 
the low comedian of the book, one may say, is 
the small boy employed by Mr. FitzGerald (his 
own eyesight failing) as " reader." This liter- 
ary character seems to have been retained as a 
source of mirth rather than of instruction, for 
we read at the outset : 

" Books you see I have nothing to say about. The 
Boy who came to read to me made such Blundering 
Work that I was forced to confine him to a Newspaper, 
where his Blunders were often as entertaining as the 
Text which he mistook. We had ' hangarues ' in the 
French Assembly, and, on one occasion, iron-clad laugh- 
ter from the Extreme Left.' Once again, at the con- 
clusion of the London news, ' Consolations closed at 
91, ex Div.' and so on." 

We shall close our poachings from Mr. Fitz- 
Gerald with the following story, which is cer- 
tainly worthy of Dean Hole : 

" Scene. Country Church on Winter's Evening. 
Congregation, with the Old Hundredth ready for the 
Parson to give out some Dismissal Words. Good old 
Parson (not at all meaning rhyme) : ' The Light has 
grown so very dim, I scarce can see to read the Hymn.' 
Congregation, taking it up : to the first half of the 
Old Hundredth: 

' The light has grown so very dim, 
I scarce can see to read the Hymn' 
(Pause, as usual: Parson, mildly impatient): 'I did 
not mean to read a Hymn, I only meant my eyes were 
dim.' 

Congregation, to second part of Old Hundredth: 
' I did not mean to read a Hymn; 
I only meant my eyes were dim.' 
Parson, out of Patience, etc.: 

' / did n't mean a Hymn at all, 
/ think the Devil 's in you all.' " 

The volume is carefully and thoroughly ed- 
ited by Mr. William Aldis Wright, who has 
wisely retained his author's peculiarities, or 
whimsicalities, of punctuation, spelling, and in 
the use of capital letters. One slip we note in 
the indexing a reference to Sainte-Beuve on 
page 38 being credited to page 35. Edward 
FitzGerald ranks easily with the best half-dozen 
of our later letter-writers ; and the reader is not 
likely to regret anything in the present volume 
save its brevity. E. G. J.

[Oct. 1, 



OUR SHAKESPEARIAN SCHOLAR.* 

In one of the many semi-apochryphal con- 
versations with Continental friends, which are 
reported by our wandering students on their 
return home, is the following passage : 

The German student to his American friend : But you 
cannot have Universities in America, for you have no 
scholars. 

(American friend says, feebly, that we have scholars.) 

G. S. : But if you have scholars, where are their 
books ? Produce the books, I beg of you, produce the 
books. 

Although the challenge is based upon a con- 
ception of scholarship somewhat different from 
that which obtains generally among us, yet it 
has a certain sense of its own. Dr. Furness's 
" Variorum Shakespeare " is one of the works 
to be produced upon such an occasion, and it 
is always with a mingling of pleasure and pride 
that it becomes a duty to chronicle the ap- 
pearance of one of its volumes in this case 
the tenth, containing " A Midsummer Night's 
Dream." It is not, however, necessary to repeat 
here the congratulations which American schol- 
ars may justly exchange with each new volume 
of this edition. Everyone knows its general 
character, the excellence of its scholarship, and 
the value of its contents. 

Each volume of the " Variorum " is a mon- 
ument to the learning, the devotion, the acumen 
of the noble army of Shakespearian critics ; 
and also to the childishness, at times, and the 
pedantry, of at least some of them. We have 
in this volume of 350 large octavo pages the 
best of what the critics have said upon "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," and also a good 
deal else. To the Shakespearian student the 
value of the book is obvious enough ; but the 
intelligent, though general, reader may perhaps 
be excused if he look somewhat coldly at the 
unutterable deal of comment to the halfpenny- 
worth of text.f Would it not be more to his 
purpose to read the play by itself, to enjoy its 
living beauty, and to let the commentators 
struggle by themselves over the dry bones? 
The generous stimulus of soul, the keen de- 
light at the reading of the play, is nowise in- 
creased by pausing on every line to consider 
opinions on a disputed reading or conjectures 
as to a difficult allusion. 

* A NEW VARIORUM EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE. Edited 
by Horace Howard Furness. Volume X., A MTDSOMMER 
NIGHT'S DREAME. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 

t This may seem a low estimate of the value of a play of 
Shakespeare's, but the allusion requires it, and when yon can 
get all the plays for a shilling, two farthings apiece is not so 
bad a price. 



The question is a perennial one ; it comes to 
mind with each new volume of the "Variorum," 
and, indeed, is practically answered by each, 
the question of the value, or perhaps better, the 
place, of the immense amount of special scholar- 
ship which by this time surrounds every play 
of Shakespeare's and many other masterpieces 
as well. There is always present in mind the 
conception, on the one hand, of the lover of 
literature who reads the plays, and the plays 
only, for pure delight in them ; and on the 
other hand, of the dryasdust who scents a 
crux in every misprint and indulges in arduous 
hair-splitting to account for every unimportant 
trifle. Between the two, Dr. Furness has good 
right to act as mediator ; for he has done as 
much hard work, and dry work too, as the next 
man, and he takes as keen a pleasure in the 
plays, as such, as anyone else. 

One matter over which Shakespearian schol- 
arship never wearies, and at which the Shake- 
speare lover is apt to gird a bit, is that concern- 
ing the dates of the plays. On this subject Dr. 
Furness has already expressed his opinion 
at the end of his discussion of the date of " The 
Tempest, " for instance ; and in this volume we 
have it again. In his few words (pp. xx., xxi.) 
upon the matter, he calls attention to the opin- 
ion of those who deem speculations on the sub- 
ject " of keen interest, and the source of what 
they thiuk is, in their own case, refined pleas- 
ure." Such students, however, he wishes would 
calmly " ask themselves, what is the chief end 
of man in reading Shakespeare. I think they 
would discern that not by the discovery of the 
dates of these plays is it that fear or compassion, 
or the sense of humor, is awakened : the clearer 
vision would enable them, I trust, to separate 
the chaff from the wheat ; and that when, be- 
fore them, there pass scenes of breathing life, 
with the hot blood stirring, they would not seek 
after the date of the play, nor ask Shakespeare 
how old he was when he wrote it " (p. xx.). 

Doubtless everybody would agree with Dr. 
Furness here, for there certainly is much empty 
pedantry in many such studies : it seems worth 
while, however, to look at the matter from a 
somewhat different point of view. As far as 
concerns refinement of intellectual pleasure for 
the individual, there will probably be little 
question between the man who is reading with 
delight for the first or the hundredth time " A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," and the one who 
is balancing evidence concerning the year the 
play was written, and therefore on the age of 
Shakespeare when he wrote it. As a play, it

would doubtless be delightful, if, as it stands 
now, it had been written by anyone and at any 
time. But it is by Shakespeare, a very in- 
teresting man, as Mr. Dowden and Mr. Wen- 
dell and others have written books to testify. 
Now these books on the nature of Shakespeare's 
genius, and the development of it, are well 
worthy of existence ; and, further, they are not 
only in themselves sources of refined pleasure, 
but they give us a certain increase of pleasure 
in reading the plays which is not to be obtained 
otherwise.* But in order that such books 
might be possible, it was necessary that a vast 
amount of guessing, criticizing, comparing, sift- 
ing, and theorizing should be done concerning 
the date of each particular play. It would not 
be enough that one scholar should study the 
matter ; the attention of many was necessary 
to secure the highest possible accuracy ; there 
needed many mistakes, many follies even, that 
the truth might be somewhat assured. A point 
here, a point there, were perhaps only curious 
speculations in themselves, but taken altogether 
the whole made up a fine piece of work, and 
one well worth the doing. It was hard work, 
and dry and stupid it seemed to many ; but it 
had to be done, and well done. And it had to 
be done by many, not merely by such as liked 
it ; it was work to which something was due 
from every scholar, if only for the honor of the 
guild ; for if left entirely to such as prized it 
above all other work, it was sure to be done 
well, perhaps not entirely as it might have been 
done. 

So, without placing the pleasure to be gained 
from a study of the dates of Shakespeare's 
plays on a level with the pleasure to be gained 
from the plays themselves, we may see that 
such studies are important and honorable in 
their way, and indeed indispensable. And 
something of the same sort may be said as to 
some of the other directions in which Shake- 
spearian criticism has directed itself : the study 
of texts, for instance, the study of sources, and 
of what not else. If it were undone, we should 
have the plays themselves, and great pleasure 
should we get from them. But now that the 
work has been done, the student who has ac- 
quainted himself with a bit of it, and kept his 
head the while, finds the plays the source not 

* I can hardly say, with Dr. Furness, that facts which are 
" purely biographical " have for me as much relevancy to the 
plays themselves as has " a chemical analysis of the paper of 
the Folio or of the ink of the Quarto" (p. xxi.). For my 
own part, on appreciating its place in Shakespeare's life, I 
read "Hamlet" with an increase of pleasure which could 
never be given me by the contemplation of a chemical formula. 



only of the simple appreciation of character 
and action and feeling, but of a hundred or a 
thousand new bits of thought and significance. 
Words and lines which before had no special 
importance come to be rich with emotion or 
weighted with meaning ; and although on a 
cursory reading such things may not, do not, 
intrude themselves on the attention, they are 
at least sub - consciously present, and give a 
body, an .atmosphere, which would otherwise 
be missing. 

It is, however, known to everyone that there 
is the temptation to be so carried away by the 
scholarship that Shakespeare himself becomes 
but a minor figure. But this is the abuse of 
what should be rightly used, and the remedy 
is temperance rather than total abstinence. 
And it is because anyone may find in this vol- 
ume of the " Variorum " a good example of the 
temperate scholarship which is a fine thing, 
rather than the pedantic abuse of it, that the 
above remarks have any pertinence here. A 
variorum edition consists of the notes and crit- 
icisms of many scholars ; but it is by no means 
a mere compilation. There is more even to be 
done than finding industriously and selecting 
carefully, and more and more as the present 
edition proceeded have its readers become ac- 
quainted with the editor. In the first volumes 
he was almost concealed behind the fruits of 
his industry ; in the present volume, as in the 
two or three before it, he takes more frequent 
occasion to mingle with the criticisms of others 
the result of his own ripened and seasoned judg- 
ment. 

Indeed, to the young student, as to the reader 
who has no desire to be a student at all, the 
great value of the present volume of the " Vari- 
orum " is not so much in exhibiting the net 
result of Shakespearian scholarship as to " A 
Midsummer Night's Dream " as in its showing 
the use to be made of all this work and the 
temper in which it is to be regarded ; and this 
is something which can hardly be rated too 
highly. 

It is not necessary to point out that Dr. Fur- 
ness is widely read, learned, industrious, acute, 
and so on. It may, however, be worth while 
to remark that he is a critic eminently sane, 
temperate, appreciative, human, sympathetic. 
He is always ready with explanation of a diffi- 
culty or suggestion of a meaning ; but he has 
little patience with the mole -like burrower 
whose investigations are so deep that the life 
and beauty of the world above is lost to him. 
He patiently records the follies of too-zealous 



178

theorists, but takes liberty to point out that no- 
body need be over-persuaded by them. He is 
careful to call attention to the knowledge which 
is good enough in itself, but lacks any real con- 
nection with the matter in hand. Nor is he so 
taken up with a sense of the dignity of his po- 
sition that he cannot indulge himself and his 
readers in pleasing satire now and then, or lam- 
bent humor. In fact, he uses his great learn- 
ing for his own ends, and by no means allows 
himself to be abused by it. And as evidence 
of all this, might be cited from the volume in 
hand hundreds of examples of editorial com- 
ment if there were space for them. We must 
be content, however, to note merely some of 
the excellences of Dr. Furness's temper as a 
scholar, which now he is more willing than for- 
merly to allow his readers to appreciate. 

And this, it would appear, is precisely what 
Dr. Furness should do. It would be a pity, 
surely, if the first Shakespearian scholar of our 
country should content himself with a resume, 
no matter how carefully arranged, of the work 
of his predecessors. It is very fortunate that 
with the succeeding volumes of his edition he 
allows us to see more and more of the scholar 
himself, and to gain what we may from so ex- 
cellent an example. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



THE ALPS FROM END TO END.* 

It is writ in an ancient Hebrew book that 
on the day of his creation man was bid by his 
Creator to "replenish the earth and subdue 
it." This task has now for many ages occupied 
man's attention, but only of late has he attained 
any great mastery of nature and any true cos- 
mopolitanism. To-day, for the first time, he 
feels fairly at home on the earth. He sails 
every water, he sets foot on every land with 
confidence. He subdues even the pinnacles of 
the earth, making of the highest Alps a sum- 
mer playground, scaling Mount Blanc and even 
the dread Matterhorn with the same zest with 
which a schoolboy climbs an apple-tree. 

This sportive familiarity of the modern man 
with great mountains is well exemplified by Sir 
William Martin Conway, as we learn from his 
latest book, " The Alps from End to End." 
Here we have the journal of a three months' 

*THE ALPS FBOM END TO END. By Sir William Martin 
Conway. With 100 full-page illustrations by A. D. M'Cor- 
mick. Westminster : Archibald Constable & Co. (Macmil- 
lan & Co., New York.) 



excursion, taking in the whole range of the 
Alps in their highest peaks, and covering a 
tramp and climb of one thousand miles, with a 
record of the ascent of twenty-one mountains 
and thirty-nine passes. The author strongly 
advises a long trip of this kind, as giving " a 
knowledge of the Alps as a range or region of 
mountains, and not merely as a casual assem- 
blage of crags, affording gymnastic problems," 
and also as conveying " a truer idea of any moun- 
tain region than can be yielded by a number 
of climbs, radiating from a centre." " When, 
however, a man has traversed the depths of a 
mountain region on foot, and climbed a succes- 
sion of peaks and passes, beholding from each 
the others that are to come, or those more re- 
motely left behind, he has within him a scale 
whereby to measure the depth as well as the 
extent of a view. 

Mr. Conway and party started from Turin, 
June 2, 1894, and soon came to the first Alp, 
Rocca dell'Abisso, " a trifling hump, but being 
number one, we wanted to climb it." However, 
as it commanded the view of a number of forts, 
they were not allowed this privilege, and so 
passed on through the verdurous Italian land- 
scape, occasionally stopping for the view. 

" We halted often, sitting on the grass amongst green 
lichen-covered rocks, with rock-walls about us, aval- 
anches booming, and a fresh air stroking our hot faces. 
Overhead was a blue sky, wherein the heavenly powers 
were spinning cirrus webs. Falling waters sang to us 
their eternal mountain song, how that all winter long 
frost had bound them in prison, but now the sun had 
come to set them free, and they were off to the sweet 
fields and bright villages, to Venice and the Sea." 

After sundry fortunes and misfortunes of no 
great consequence, the party came on to the 
Ruitor neve-, an immense field of glacier snow. 

" Seldom have I been in lovelier surroundings than 
those afforded by the rippled neve and the glittering 
mist. The air was soft. A perfect silence reigned. 
Nothing in sight had aspect of solidity; we seemed to 
be in a world of gossamer and fairy webs. Presently 
there came an indescribable movement and flickering 
above us, as though our bright chaos were taking form. 
Vague and changeful shapes trembled into view and 
disappeared. Low flowing light bands striped the white 
floor. Wisps of mist danced and eddied around. At 
last, to our dewildered delight, there spread before us 
in one long range the whole mass of Mont Blanc and 
the Grandes Jorasses, a vision of sparkling beauty be- 
held through a faint veil, which imperceptibly dissolved 
and disappeared. I halted to gaze on the wondrous 
panorama, thus astonishingly revealed. Assuredly no- 
where else is Mont Blanc better seen than from this 
Ruitor neve. No foreground more admirably serves to 
set off its blue shadowing buttresses and cream-colored 
domes than the flat white area of this magnificent snow- 
field."

Shortly after this "celestial vision," they 
made the first ascent of Mont Blanc for the 
year 1894. The author's description of the 
present appearance of the summit is interest- 
ing: 

" It was just noon when we stood on the top, arriving 
there all together. The first thing we looked at was 
not Europe at our feet, but M. Jansen's hut a dread- 
ful disfigurement. The last time I was here, the sur- 
face of the dome was one unbroken curve of snow, aloof 
from man. Now man has rooted the evidences of his 
activity deep into the icy mass and strewed its surface 
with shavings and paper, so frozen down that the storms 
of the whole year have not sufficed to remove them. I 
cannot, however, say that we felt any resentment against 
the hut-builders, for we took shelter behind the observ- 
atory from the blasts of the cold gale." 

From this summit there was a magnificent 
panorama ; but the clouds were the most fas- 
cinating. Mr. Con way is very much alive to 
the beauty of clouds, regarding them as " every 
bit as beautiful as mountains," and he has 
much to say about them in this book. From 
Mont Blanc Mr. Conway proceeded on through 
the Bernese Oberland and the Tyrol, and fin- 
ished his expedition by the ascent of the An- 
kogl, " the last of the snowy Alps." 

Mr. Conway, we note, is not one of those who 
abuse the mountain railways, which are becom- 
ing so common in the Alps. He regards them 
of distinct use to all, and as having a special 
value in keeping the crowd to a definite track, 
which the unconventional traveller can easily 
avoid. " Every new hill railroad, every recog- 
nized lunching-place or Belvedere, becomes a 
further clamp that yet more irrevocably holds 
the crowd to its particular and narrow route." 
On this point, I observe that that excellent 
traveller Mr. Finck, in a recent letter to " The 
Nation," is of similar opinion, and he shows 
also that the railways need not deface the land- 
scape. 

There is, on the whole, some sense of disap- 
pointment in this book. It chronicles no great 
feats and no thrilling adventures, as does Mr. 
Whymper in his " Scrambles among the Alps " 
or his " Great Andes of the Equator," or as 
Mr. Conway's own " Climbing in the Korako- 
ram-Himalayas." This volume is too scrappy 
in contents and in style, and sometimes there 
is a suspicion of padding. In short, the book 
is not inevitable enough. It is interesting in 
parts, but its chief value is as a guide-book sup- 
plementary to Baedeker. This value is greatly 
increased by the last chapter, " so kindly con- 
tributed by the Eev. W. A. B. Coolidge, the 
most learned expert in Alpine topography that 
has ever lived." The volume sadly lacks a 



map, and a glossary of mountaineering terms 
would be very acceptable to most readers. The 
work is fully illustrated with drawings by Mr. 
M'Cormick. These are soft and artistic, and 
the experienced Alpinist will find them highly 
interesting and suggestive ; but, for the most 
part, they will be " caviare to the general."

THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY.* 

The anticipations awakened when it was an- 
nounced that Mr. W. J. Courthope was en- 
gaged in the preparation of "A History of 
English Poetry " are now in a measure realized 
by the publication of the first volume of the 
work, accompanied by a promise that the re- 
maining volumes shall be forthcoming during 
the next few years. Such a history, which 
amounts to a history of our literature in the 
noblest and most significant of its forms, has 
long been awaited, and it is probable that no 
more competent hand for the work than that 
of Mr. Courthope could be found among liv- 
ing English or American scholars. It is true 
that he is lacking in equipment for some parts 
of the work, and particularly for the treat- 
ment of the period discussed in this initial vol- 
ume ; but the most versatile student can hardly 
be expected, in these days of intensive inves- 
tigation, to do adequate justice to the great 
subject of our thousand years of poetical his- 
tory in all of its aspects. To elucidate En- 
glish poetry, as annalist, philologist, and met- 
rical specialist, as aesthetic critic and philosoph- 
ical historian, as student of its ethical and 
political bearings, of its manifold relations to 
the life of our race, this is a task not likely 
to come within the reach of any one man, how- 
ever great his will and his scholarly devotion. 
It is not in disparagement, then, but in recog- 
nition of the inevitable limitations of the indi- 
vidual, that we must set down Mr. Courthope's 
work as defective in some of these matters. 
Mere annalist he does not attempt to be, and 
he frankly confesses that he is not a philologist. 
As a metrist, he gives evidence of much spe- 
cial preparation, yet even here he is not always 
abreast of modern English scholarship. But 
For the other aspects of the work his equipment 
is substantial, and he has built upon a broad 
and deep foundation.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



,The underlying principle of Mr. Courthope's 
treatment of English poetry is found in his con- 
ception of the fundamental unity of the subject 
and of its solidarity with the other phases, 
artistic, social, and political, of English life. 
" My aim has been," he says, " to treat poetry 
as an expression of the imagination, not simply 
of the individual poet, but of the English peo- 
ple ; to use the facts of political and social his- 
tory as keys to the poet's meaning, and to make 
poetry clothe with life and character the dry 
record of external facts." In this aim, we note, 
Mr. Courthope is at one with M. Jusserand, 
whose work we reviewed not long ago ; although 
the former writer keeps his extra-literary ma- 
terial more in the background than does the 
latter. To exhibit the principle of growth and 
movement in our poetry, to show that there 
are in its history no inexplicable phenomena, 
is set down by the author as a second primary 
aim, although, strictly considered, it is rather 
a corollary of the aim previously formulated. 
This principle is illustrated by the account of 
the Renaissance, in which he takes exception 
to the tendency of such men as Symonds and 
Pater to regard that new birth of the spirit as 
" a sudden and isolated movement of the hu- 
man mind, which cannot be explained by the 
ordinary methods of historic investigation." In 
outlining his plan of treatment, Mr. Courthope 
distinguishes " from Chaucer downwards . . . 
the confluence of three great streams of thought, 
which blend in a single channel without any 
of them ever quite losing its separate life and 
identity." These streams of thought are : (1) 
"The genius of Race, the stream of Anglo- 
Saxon language, character, and custom, modi- 
fied by the influence of Scandinavian imagin- 
ation, as well as by all the impulses and ideas 
derived from the Latin nations through the 
Norman Conquest." (2) The tradition of Ed- 
ucation systematized by the Latin Church, 
many traces of which survive in the courses of 
our universities and public schools." (3) " The 
tradition of Graeco - Roman Culture, carried 
through the barbarous ages in many slender 
ducts and channels, which, mingling the spirit 
of the ancient world with the infant civilization 
of Europe, prepared the way for the great re- 
vival of arts and letters commonly known as 
the Renaissance." 

This is admirably put, no doubt, and em- 
bodies a sound philosophy of the subject, but 
the words " from Chaucer downwards " are sig- 
nificant, and call attention to the feature of 
Mr. Courthope's treatment likely to provoke 



the largest measure of dissent. For he contra- 
venes his fundamental doctrine of unity by re- 
fusing to apply, except in a one-sided way, the 
method above outlined to the history of our 
poetry from Caedmon to Chaucer. He is very 
emphatic upon this point. " Between the poetry 
produced in England before the Norman Con- 
quest and the poetry of Chaucer there is abso- 
lutely no link of connection." To state his po- 
sition simply, it is that the antecedents of the 
Chaucerian and post-Chaucerian poetry are to 
be sought in " the region of mixed culture pre- 
vailing among the nations of joint Latin and 
Teutonic descent." We are content to state 
Mr. Courthope's position, without arguing at 
length against it. To our mind, the opposed 
position,'so well occupied and strongly defended 
by Ten Brink, M. Jusserand, and Mr. Stop- 
ford Brooke, is more tenable ; but the whole 
question is obviously one of balance between 
the three elements of the problem as already 
outlined. Mr. Courthope magnifies the import- 
ance of the second and third at the expense of 
the first, that is all. Mr. Brooke, on the other 
hand, has probably magnified unduly the first 
at the expense of the others. Both views de- 
part from the mean which here, as almost every- 
where else, is golden ; but Mr. Courthope's de- 
parture seems the wider and the less justifiable. 
The adequate classical equipment of the au- 
thor is doubtless responsible for the undue 
stress that he puts upon the classical and other 
non-racial influences in the development of our 
poetry. He is constantly seeking for classical 
parallels and illustrations, as when he calls 
Langland the Naevius and Chaucer the Ennius 
of English poetry. He gives us a fine analysis 
of the decay of the classical spirit in European 
thought, and pictures with ample knowledge 
and insight the transition to medievalism. He 
assumes a corresponding sympathy and knowl- 
edge on the part of his readers when he prints 
without translation many of the Latin passages 
cited in the furtherance of his argument, al- 
though translations are given of the Italian 
and even of the Old English quotations. This 
classical bent, so characteristic of Mr. Court- 
hope's treatment throughout, seems on the 
whole fortunate (even if a little partial), be- 
cause it does justice to a phase of the subject 
to which most historians have done something 
less than justice. We shall await with an in- 
terest even greater than occasioned in the pres- 
ent volume the applications of Mr. Courthope's 
classical scholarship to the later periods of our 
poetry, so rich in opportunities for the tracing

of classical parallels of expression and analo- 
gies of thought. 

A rapid commentary upon the successive 
chapters of this volume may now be given. Of 
the introductory chapters we have already dis- 
cussed the salient features. They are followed 
by one on Anglo-Saxon poetry, in the course 
of which three stages are indicated : (1) The 
primitive Teutonic pre-Christian compositions 
(Beowulf, etc.). (2) Compositions in which 
the art of minstrelsy is applied to scriptural 
subjects (Czedmon). (3) Compositions dom- 
inated by the influence of Latin ecclesiastical 
education (Cynewulf, etc.). On the vexed 
question of the composition of " Beowulf," Mr. 
Courthope stands for unity of authorship. The 
chapter on Anglo-Norman poetry is crowded, 
and its treatment is less satisfactory than that 
of M. Jusserand. This is followed by a chap- 
ter on the early Renaissance, in which space is 
found for rather lengthy consideration of 
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, of the " Ro- 
man de la Rose," and of Laurence Minot and 
the political songs of his period. This episode 
brings us to Langland and Chaucer, who have 
chapters to themselves, about equal in length. 
They are, on the whole, perfunctory summaries, 
arranging in a fairly acceptable manner the 
materials collected by past scholarship. The 
most striking thing in the treatment of Lang- 
land is the elaborate comparison of "Piers 
Plowman " and the " Divine Comedy "; the dis- 
tinctive note of the chapter about Chaucer is 
its envisagement of the poet as a full realiza- 
tion of the ideals of the trouvere. A chapter 
upon Gower, Lydgate, and Occleve comes 
next, and informs us that Gower's " poetical 
qualities are of a high order," which does not 
exactly agree with Lowell's opinion, and is not 
as likely to find acceptance. The recent dis- 
covery, by Mr. Macaulay, of the lost " Specu- 
lum Meditantis," came too late to be mentioned 
in the present work. The various uses of alle- 
gory in the Middle Ages, with illustrations 
from Henryson, Dunbar, Douglas, Hawes, Skel- 
ton, and Barclay, is the subject of the next 
chapter, and leads up to an account of " The 
Rise of the Drama in England." Mr. Court- 
hope does not propose to treat of the drama at 
length, for reason of the histories already ex- 
isting, which does not seem to us an entirely 
adequate excuse for neglecting the greatest of 
English poetical forms. " The Decay of En- 
glish Minstrelsy " is the subject of a chapter 
which admirably illustrates the philosophical 
method of the whole work, a method that is 



constantly reverting to the origins of the move- 
ment or form under consideration, and deals 
with it from a historical and evolutionary stand- 
point. A brief " Retrospect " brings the vol- 
ume to its close. 

In conclusion, we will venture to express the 
hope that Mr. Courthope may be permitted to 
complete the work he has so well begun. When 
we think of Warton, Morley, and Ten Brink, 
to say nothing of the unrealized plans of Pope, 
Gray, and so many others, we cannot fail to 
be impressed with the uncertainty of all such 
great intellectual undertakings as the present. 
We are comparatively rich in treatments of 
our poetical history in its beginnings, but from 
the Elizabethan period downwards, we have 
practically nothing continuous but the great 
work of Taine. Just now there are three men 
in the race, Mr. Courthope, Mr. Brooke, and 
M. Jusserand. All three have started well, 
and we shall indeed have reasons for self-con- 
gratulation if all three live to carry out their 
plans. Of these three ambitious beginnings, 
that of Mr. Courthope, in spite of the strictures 
that we have found it necessary to make, is on 
the whole the most promising. Completed in 
accordance with its present design, it will be 
such a monument of our poetical history as the 
scholarship of the twentieth century will not 
easily better, and such as few literary archi- 
tects will be found daring enough to attempt 
to rival. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH.* 

The cataloguers in our public libraries, com- 
ing to the volume on " The Teaching of English 
in American Universities," will doubtless enter 
it under the rubric " Educational " and justly 
so. Only as we have been shaking off pro- 
vincialism we have come to know that in the 
largest sense three-quarters of the world's lit- 
erature is properly educational. The culture 
of the individual is the correlative of the rights 
of the individual, and civilization means pre- 
cisely the possibility of individual rights and 
individual culture. The history of culture is 
the vastly significant thing at the heart of all 
history. In the story of Greek education, of 
the education of the church in the middle 
ages, and of modern public and corporate 
education, is summarized the story of modern

civilization. The old order is breaking up, now 
as ever, and we desire to readjust our scheme 
of culture to a new order of ideas. We have 
thought too narrowly that education is mainly 
mental training. We are ambitious now to 
attempt to mould equally the physical form 
and the moral nature. It is true, of course, 
that intellectual training has always involved 
moral discipline as a sine qua non, but perhaps 
there are years in which the order should be 
reversed and the intellectual training should be 
incidental to the moral. And of course moral 
does not mean merely prudential or prudish. 

The literature of power appeals directly to 
the moral nature. Can we grade and present 
this literature in such a way as to make it a 
progressive curriculum of moral training ? Cer- 
tainly not after any half-hearted and mechan- 
ical system. But broadly and liberally yes. 
Let us begin our experiment, therefore, with 
the literature which offers the least impediment 
of mere scholasticism, which appeals the most 
directly to the moral mood and to sympathetic 
emotions. Let us take English literature, and 
make of it a means to direct training of facul- 
ties hitherto neglected in our imperfectly organ- 
ized modern educational system. Eeasoning of 
this sort, I take it, prompts the movement of 
which this book is the outcome and the expres- 
sion. 

As a book, it is both experimental and de- 
liberative. It is a record of experiments and 
attempts, a sort of cooperative stock-taking and 
balancing of accounts, together with delibera- 
tions and counsellings as to methods and theo- 
ries and beliefs. It is evident that the move- 
ment is still experimental, although the theory 
of it is becoming rapidly approved. English 
literature is to be taught as literature, with the 
full force and effect of the emotional and imag- 
inative meaning of each masterpiece considered, 
if in any way this can be managed. From Bos- 
ton to Berkeley, we agree upon this. The aim 
is to make great books speak loudly and thrill- 
m gty to the secret and primary consciousness 
of each pupil and neophyte, as they speak at 
their best to the chosen few. Then as we read 
in youth so will we read in age, and the springs 
of emotion will be stirred with formative and 
lofty ideals. 

But we must beware lest a separation, too 
early and too easy, be forced between what are 
at bottom but two aspects of one being, the 
moral nature and the intellectual nature. Both 
the intellect and the emotions are servants of 
the will, and must be trained together pari 



We must avoid scholasticism in liter- 
ary teaching, but we must beware equally of a 
de-intellectualized emotionalism and of hazy 
Hegelianisms fitted in as connotative interpre- 
tations. Simply because literature appeals more 
directly to the emotions and the will, it is not 
exempted from the tests and the discipline of 
logic. 

Again, we should remember that as all hu- 
man action in a wide prospect is of mixed 
moral worth, so even the greatest literature 
does not reflect perfect ideals. This is perhaps 
elementary, but it is mostly disregarded ; and 
consequently all art, from Plato to the Puritans, 
has been put on the defensive. And with the 
Philistines (who replenish the earth) it is a 
grave consideration. Wherefore logic and the 
sciences appear safer, while the emotional na- 
ture is restrained from generalizing into forms 
of art and is stifled at home and in school under 
the rule-of-thumb. A great deal can be said 
on this question. Ruskin and the psycholo- 
gists are quite right in pointing out that the 
excitation of emotions which receive no vent in 
action (or even the similitude of action) is dan- 
gerous. The great aim of literature, however, 
is to excite the purely sympathetic emotions. 
Art does not excite the concupiscence of the 
individual. But what is the duty of the teacher 
of literature in these premises ? Shall he ster- 
ilize his text, and lift it out of the range of 
sympathy? Or shall he gloze it and preach 
from it his own philosophy of life ? A short 
and straightforward answer is not easy. 

This volume is a compilation of papers that 
are for the most part already familiar to the 
readers of THE DIAL. But their full value 
can be appreciated only when they are taken 
together. As they stand, they form an indis- 
pensable book of reference and vade mecum to 
all interested in the teaching and study of En- 
glish literature. The various reports from each 
college, which make up the body of the volume, 
form a record that is authoritative, and as ac- 
curate as may be under the circumstances. For 
purposes of exact comparison, however, an in- 
dependent general view by one impartial inves- 
tigator would be necessary. But the chief inter- 
est of the volume, after all, is in its discussions, 
and in what it reveals of motive, ideal, and 
theory. Much is suggested in this way, but 
much more remains to be worked out by con- 
ference and through experience. It is plain 
that the field of English teaching is still but 
poorly defined. The present state of the mat- 
ter is admirably summed up in Mr. Payne's

general introduction to the volume. The best 
opinion, I believe, is all with him, both in his 
views as to secondary school and to the collegi- 
ate study of English. He stands for a sound 
and well-approved ideal of literature and of lit- 
erary training. It is a very vital matter this, 
whether the ideal of the best judges and lovers 
of literature, of men like Goethe, Coleridge, 
Ste. Beuve, Ruskin, and Lowell, is to be ac- 
cepted in our organized teaching of literature, 
or whether some narrower and more technical 
view of literary culture is to prevail. The intel- 
ligent and educated public is deeply interested 
in this question. This book is a landmark in 
a discussion which is not yet ended.

RECENT WORKS ON ETHICAL, THEOKY 
AND THE MORAL, 



The immortality which, as it would seem, has been 
vouchsafed to the " Meditations " of Marcus Aure- 
lius, shows the existence of a constant and wide- 
spread interest in collections of moral aphorisms. 
To the great majority of the reading public, system- 
atic treatises on ethics are caviare ; but the writer 
who, without descending to argument or attempted 
demonstration, speaks straight to the moral con- 
sciousness, revealing to dull eyes the beauty of char- 
acter and the glory of service in the great cause, 
warming the heart with a sense of fellowship in 
well-doing or calling attention to duties hitherto un- 
perceived, such a writer is sure of a welcome from 
earnest men and women. It is a need of this kind 
that Dr. Coit has sought to supply in the little book 
entitled "The Message of Man." It is a well- 
selected collection of brief quotations representing 
the best thought on the problems of the moral life 
on the part of more than two hundred writers. At 
the same time, it is something better than a mere 
unorganized mass of disjointed quotations after the 
manner of Bartlett's " Dictionary." Each selection 
has been fitted to the next preceding with such ad- 
mirable skill that at least the main divisions of a 
chapter often read like continuous discourse, an 
effect which is rather heightened than otherwise by 
the division of the text into verses after the manner 
of the " Imitation of Christ " and the " Meditations." 
The compiler has supplied two excellent indexes 
one by chapters, giving the source of each verse in

of all the selections from any one author. 

" Ethical Addresses " is a collection of lectures, 
originally prepared for delivery before the various 
societies for ethical culture in the United States. 
They deal for the most part, not with disputed 
points of the moral code, nor with the abstract the- 
ories of systematic ethics, but rather with certain 
phases and problems of that moral experience which 
is the common possession of humanity. What is 
implied in the deliberate choice of devotion to duty 
as the supreme principle of every-day life is impress- 
ively set forth in two lectures by Mr. Salter. Dr. 
Adler draws an exquisite picture of the modern 
saint, contrasting him with the mediaeval ideal of 
holiness on the one hand, and with the heroic type 
of character on the other. In the address on prayer 
and worship, Dr. Adler asks the question : How can 
high ideals be maintained by those who find it im- 
possible to voice their aspirations for perfection 
either in private prayer or in the exercises of wor- 
ship as conducted in the churches ? Other subjects 
discussed are : The religion of ethical culture, true 
liberalism, what does it mean to be religious? etc. 
The opening pages are devoted to a paper written 
originally for " The Forum," in which Dr. Adler, the 
founder of the ethical movement, gives a clear and 
complete presentation of the aims and methods of 
the ethical societies. Although the papers thus 
brought together are without external marks of rela- 
tionship to each other, nevertheless a bond of union 
exists between them in the common spirit which per- 
vades them all. This finds expression in the con- 
viction that man has within himself the power to 
choose the right and to follow day by day its com- 
mands ; that to make him moral you need not ap- 
peal to the fear of future punishment, or even to 
the desire of divine approbation and favor ; you have 
but to open his eyes to the sacredness of duty, to 
the beauty of the perfected character, and to the 
claims of his fellow-men, who are his brethren. To 
some minds, such doctrines will appear strange, if 
not actually repugnant ; to others they are the very 
corner-stone of their life's structure. To the former 
class, the moral strength and enthusiasm of these 
writers will come as the revelation of a new world. 
To many of the latter, these papers may serve as 
the formulation of ideals and principles of action 
for which they have long sought definite expression. 
To the earnest student of whatever creed, they are 
to be recommended as reflecting faithfully the spirit 
of one of the most significant movements of the 
present time. 

" Institutional Ethics " is a work dealing with the 
ethical aspects of the four great institutions of so- 
ciety, namely, the family, the school, the state, and 
the church. The detailed discussion of these topics 
is introduced by two chapters devoted to a statement 
of fundamental principles. We are bound to con- 
fess that a careful perusal of this book has failed 
to disclose anything either new or particularly val-

uable in its contents. To be sure, we have found 
some interesting quotations from Mr. John Fiske, 
J. R. Green, Prof. H. K. Adams, and other sources, 
equally difficult of access, and, furthermore, we have 
observed that a few of the commonplaces of ethical 
science have been allowed to drift into the text ; but 
he who seeks for more than this is doomed to dis- 
appointment. The introductory chapters are steeped 
in the lore of Dr. W. T. Harris. Possibly some 
readers may find them edifying; personally, we 
could not, though that of course may be due to in- 
tellectual myopia combined with narrow sympathies. 
In connection with a definition of justice as " the 
exaction of what is due to the self," we read (page 
3) : " The return of the heavenly bodies unto their 
own places shows the phase of justice in the creative 
process, the unconscious claiming of that which is 
their own." When this interesting statement met 
our eye we prepared ourselves to be entertained, if 
nothing more. But even this hope failed. 

We have asserted that works on systematic eth- 
ics are likely to prove caviare to the average lay- 
man, but we must add that the last twenty-five 
years have witnessed a development in the methods 
and results of ethical investigation, sufficiently 
marked to be worthy of the attention of the outside 
public. No longer than a generation ago, the study 
of the subject resembled the performances of a de- 
bating society ; every man was in it to help his side 
win, and you would as soon expect to find an hon- 
est citizen who had voted with his party since Fre- 
mont was nominated admitting that the scales had 
fallen from his eyes at a democratic campaign meet- 
ing, as to find a participant in the great debate on 
morals who had allowed the arguments of his op- 
ponents to make any particular impression upon his 
mind. Perhaps the moralist of to-day has learned 
a thing or two from the struggles of the past, per- 
haps he is less interested in " schools " and more 
interested in facts than were his predecessors ; at 
all events, an unmistakable tendency towards a gen- 
eral agreement on a number of fundamental points 
is making itself felt for the first time in the history 
of ethics, a sign, as we take it, that we are ready 
to bid farewell to the days of blind partisanship and 
of the superficial dilettanteism with which, curiously 
enough, it was invariably accompanied. To the 
question, What makes any given action right? a 
compact school of moralists have for a century or 
more insisted no answer could be given, except what 
an ungallant cynic has styled a " woman's answer," 
namely, " It is so because it is so." To-day almost 
all the leading students of the subject are agreed 
that an ungrounded moral judgment is a moon made 
of green cheese ; that an action that is right is right 
for some reason, and this reason is found in the end 
which it subserves. Expressed in a bare formula, 
this end is the well-being of those in any way affected 
by the action. With regard to what constitutes well- 
being, there does indeed exist serious difference 
of opinion, one school holding that all its elements 
are ultimately reducible to happiness, the other 



claiming that it is rather to be identified with the 
perfection of our whole nature, more particularly 
of character. But much has certainly been accom- 
plished when a complex problem has been reduced 
to this simple form. 

Again, it is not many years since conscience was 
quite generally held to be an infallible guide. To- 
day it is seen that moral insight, like all other parts 
of knowledge, is subject to the laws of growth; that 
as a result, there may be traced through the ages a 
progress in the apprehension of the nature of true 
well-being, an increasing display of intelligent care 
in the selection of the necessary means and a con- 
stant widening in the circle of those having ad- 
mitted claims upon our service. Formerly the same 
school held that conscience was a separate faculty 
dwelling apart by itself in the mental world ; to-day 
it is generally recognized as but the name for the 
varied and complicated processes which reveal to us 
what is contained in and what manner of life is re- 
quired by the moral ideal. 

At the same time, it must be admitted that the 
present state of ethical study leaves much to be de- 
sired, and the future will certainly see methods of 
investigation in common use of whose value few 
moralists of to-day seem to have any conception. 
The fundamental problems of ethics deal with judg- 
ments of approbation and reprobation upon con- 
duct. As yet, the great majority of moralists have 
contented themselves with resting the broadest gen- 
eralizations upon the testimony of their own narrow 
experience. As a result, the personal equation has 
played a role whose magnitude is not unfairly repre- 
sented by the number of conflicting statements as 
to matters of fact which may be found even in stand- 
ard modern treatises. Already, however, the way 
out of this labyrinth is beginning to dawn upon the 
minds of a few investigators. We must study with 
equal care and attention the moral judgments passed 
by ourselves and by others, by Americans and by 
Russians, by Europeans of the nineteenth century 
and those of the ninth, by the saint and the man 
of the world, by the child and by a Goethe, by the 
Australian savages and the cultured Athenians. 
All of these judgments, alike the commonplace, the 
exceptional, and the apparently absurd, must be 
described, analyzed, and explained, before any con 
elusions as to the principles underlying them are of 
much more value, as science, than the ipse dixit of 
our friends the Esoteric Buddhists. The ethics of 
the immediate future will profit also by the rapid 
advances which are being made in psychology. It 
has been in vain to discuss the differentia of delib- 
erate and instinctive action with an inadequate ac- 
quaintance with the phenomena of volition. The 
place of reason in the moral life might be debated 
forever if there were no prospect of obtaining a 
better insight into the true nature of the mental 
processes covered by this term. The now generally 
accepted doctrine of conscience is largely the fruit 
of the conquests of modern psychology.

THE DIAL 



185 



f Elements of Ethics " is a representative book of 
the period. Conduct is declared to be right or 
wrong according as it is calculated to promote or 
hinder the development of the capabilities of human 
nature. The fallibility of conscience is freely ad- 
mitted, and all that is insisted upon is its inviola- 
bility, i. e., its right to uniform obedience from us, 
as the ultimate authority on the problems within 
its jurisdiction. Conscience itself is defined as the 
mind occupied with moral phenomena. These con- 
clusions bring the author in line with modern 
thought. On the other hand, he has transcended 
it neither in his methods nor his results. We find 
a greater show of precision and exhaustiveness in 
the analysis of phenomena under investigation, with- 
out being, as a matter of fact, brought much farther 
than previous writers have carried us. The extent 
to which the recent treatises in psychology have 
been studied appears to be meagre, and there is no 
trace of any conception of the rich harvest to be 
obtained by an objective study of the moral judg- 
ments as exhibited in others besides ourselves. 
Apart from an outline of the history of ethical 
thought, and chapters devoted respectively to a con- 
sideration of elementary principles, to the relation 
of religion and morality, and to the relation of rights 
and duties, the main body of the book is occupied 
with the discussion of two great problems : the con- 
ditions of moral judgment, i. e., of the imputation 
of praise or blame, and the criterion of moral judg- 
ment. The answer given to the latter and, indeed, 
the positions taken throughout mark the author 
as a member of the school of the late Professor T. 
H. Green. The conditions of moral judgment are 
held to be two in number : first, the possession of 
freedom in the sense of power to choose between 
alternatives ; and secondly, the possession of con- 
science, or the power to recognize moral distinctions. 
It cannot be said that the discussion of these sub- 
jects brings out much that is absolutely new, but 
the author has stated more clearly than any other 
member of his school just what is essential to moral 
responsibility, and a matter of equal importance 
what is not. This portion of his book is worthy 
of careful study. The remainder will certainly re- 
pay the professional moralist for a rapid reading, 
but he will find, on the whole, considerably more 
desert than oasis. The college student for whom 
the work is in a manner especially prepared, and 
the general reader who happens to be hungering and 
thirsting after a knowledge of the principles of 
ethics, will be repelled, we fear, by the heavy style 
and the dreary length to which many of the discus- 
sions have been drawn out. They should be in- 
formed, however, that the former at least is a fail- 
ing common to ethical treatises. The teacher in 
search of a text-book will hardly find in this the 
realization of his ideals, and yet if two-thirds of the 
colleges in the country should adopt it in place of 
what they now use, the change would undoubtedly 
be to the advantage of all concerned.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 






In the rambling Introduction to his 
. "New Studies in Literature" (Hough- 

ton), Professor Edward Dowden dis- 
cusses the influence of democracy upon genius, the 
hollowness of manufactured patriotism among Irish- 
men, the future of poetry, the modern school of 
historical writing, and a few other subjects. Upon 
the first theme he is mildly optimistic, and upon 
the second eminently sane; toward the third his 
attitude is not very clearly defined (although he 
goes out of the way to gird at Matthew Arnold's 
familiar prophecy), and toward the fourth his atti- 
tude is one of semi-regretful acceptance. These dis- 
cursive remarks precede a group of essays in which 
we read, first, of the poetry of Mr. George Mere- 
dith and Mr. Robert Bridges, then of John Donne, 
the good Dean of St. Paul's, and then of the amours 
de voyage of Fabre d' Eglantine. These essays lead 
us up to what we may call the core of the volume 
a series of chapters upon Goethe. Then follow 
papers upon Coleridge, Edmond Scherer, " Liter- 
ary Criticism in France," and " The Teaching of 
English Literature." The five chapters upon as 
many aspects of Goethe's protean individuality dis- 
play the critical powers of the author at their best. 
While they hardly have the comprehensive vision 
of another English critic of Goethe the late Sir 
John Seeley they exhibit acute penetration and 
unfailing sympathy, qualities not as common as they 
ought to be in English appreciations of the greatest 
of Germans. And it is precisely by this method of 
approaching Goethe from many special points of 
view that he is alone fully to be understood. In 
many respects the most interesting chapter of this 
volume is the closing one " an introductory lec- 
ture to my college class " on " The Teaching of En- 
glish Literature." The writer makes a number of 
excellent points. In the first place, he insists that 
the general view shall not be dispensed with. " A 
General Sketch of European Literature " is neces- 
sary for the student, and he should be made to learn 
it. It should be a book of some three hundred 
pages. " It would be possible by brute force to 
hammer the contents of this little book into a boy's 
head in the course of a few weeks or months, and 
brute force could hardly be better employed. The 
young student of history would ever after be able 
to place things aright, and to understand how this 
thing is related to that. He might by-and-by pro- 
ceed to fill in one fragment of the great map with 
topographical details, nor rest until he had become 
intimate with every feature of his chosen province." 
In addition to this book there should be a similar 
manual of English literary history, likewise to be 
learned. But and the proviso is of the utmost 
importance no such history " should be read until 
the student is made to perceive and feel what knowl- 
edge at first hand indeed is by being put to work 
on an actual text." What Professor Dowden means 
by this kind of work he then proceeds to illustrate

by taking the play of " Hamlet," and describing, in 
much detail, the way in which the student should 
set about its study, and, having mastered it, should 
pass to the study of its author, its period, and its 
relation to literature as a whole. Finally, there are 
the larger inductions that can alone give unity and 
meaning to the study of literature. Philosophical 
criticism is the ultimate aim, and the author speaks 
upon this point with no uncertain accent. " That 
there are general laws or principles applying to the 
various forms of literature, in whatever age and in 
whatever clime produced, is certain." Subjective 
criticism gets no countenance from the writer of 
this sentence, and can get no countenance from any 
serious teacher of literature. 

Mr. Willis J. Abbot's Life of Car- 
ter Henry Harrison" (Dodd,Mead& 
Co.) is a sympathetic and creditable, 
though somewhat eulogistic, biography of a man 
whose career and personality may be taken as strik- 
ingly typical of a passing phase of national life and 
character. With certain familiar foibles and eccen- 
tricities, Mr. Harrison was an estimable, and in 
some points even an admirable, man, a sturdy and 
characteristic product of American democracy, 
whose unwearied and often useful political activity 
was at least measurably motived by public spirit 
and an honest desire to serve the general welfare. 
Mr. Harrison's career was full of change and stir- 
ring incident, and Mr. Abbot tells the story well, 
dwelling chiefly on the really essential and instruc- 
tive phases, and resisting the obvious temptation to 
exaggerate and over-color the more sensational epi- 
sodes. The narrative is freely sprinkled with quo- 
tations from Mr. Harrison's speeches and writings 
the latter naively frank and egotistical produc- 
tions, such as could scarcely have been written by 
other than an essentially honest man. An extract 
from a youthful journal describing the street scenes 
attending the third Napoleon's coup d'etat, of which 
the writer, with Bayard Taylor, was an eye-witness, 
shows some really good descriptive writing, terse, 
vivid, and dramatic, which will surprise those famil- 
iar with the rather inflated and wordy style usually 
affected by the " World's Fair Mayor." Says Mr. 
Harrison : " At one time I was in a pack at the 
mouth of Rue Lafitte when some firing was heard 
up the boulevard ; we were ordered to disperse with 
an ' Allez-vous-en ! ' We paid no attention to it. 
Then came a stern ' Va-fen ! ' We knew that 
meant business, especially when a platoon of infan- 
try was seen rapidly approaching. I was open to 
the enemy. I ran, putting my hands in front of 
me, and then drawing them back, as if swimming. 
Each motion put two or three Frenchmen, not so 
strong as I, behind me. I thus made a living breast- 
work to my rear, of probably a hundred, when the 
crash of musketry was heard. There were screams. 
How many were hit I did not hear, but I soon saw 
two men on shutters borne up the street." Chica- 
goans will have no difficulty in picturing the stal- 



wart ex-mayor cleaving his way through the pack. 
Commenting on Mr. Harrison's assassination, the 
author does not hesitate to lay a due share of the 
responsibility for that deplorable deed at the door 
of the Chicago press, which had, during the heated 
canvass shortly preceding the tragedy, heaped upon 
Mr. Harrison the vilest and most unjustifiable abuse. 
While the murderer Prendergast, a half -crazed 
place-hunter of the Guiteau stamp, was mainly im- 
pelled to his crime by a fancied political slight, his 
conduct at the trial leaves no doubt that he believed 
to the last the public would justify him in ridding 
it of the vicious man and corrupt official depicted 
by the leading newspapers. In the light of such 
examples as that of Mr. Garfield and Mr. Harri- 
son, it is not too much to say that a man who braves 
newspaper calumny by becoming a candidate for 
election to a hotly-disputed office does so at peril 
not only of his good name, but of his life. 

" A Sketch of the Life and Work of 
Domenico Morelli," by Mr. Ashton 
R. Willard, is issued in a very at- 
tractive volume by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. Signor Morelli, the acknowledged present 
leader of Italian art, is a Neapolitan ; and it is 
largely to the stimulus of his example and influence 
that the current artistic ascendancy of his native 
city is due. The part played heretofore in the history 
of Italian painting by the southern capital has been 
relatively inferior ; and its contribution to the gen- 
eral product, even during the splendid efflorescence 
of the national art in the sixteenth century, is 
strangely insignificant in character and amount. Su- 
preme among the native cities in the beauty of her 
surroundings, in the natural motifs and scenic inspir- 
ations favorable to a rich and luxuriant artistic de- 
velopment, Naples nevertheless produced in the 
past, near and remote, few men who are now re- 
membered, or who won even in their own day wide- 
spread recognition. It might seem as if the Nea- 
politans, favored beyond other men by partial 
Nature, had been content to bask lazzaroni-like in 
the sunshine of her beauty, without rendering her 
the laborious homage of strenuous study and por- 
trayal. But Naples, stirred by the genius and ac- 
tivity of a gifted citizen, Domenico Morelli, has 
awakened from her long lethargy ; and it may be 
hoped that her awakening presages for Italy at 
least an afterglow of the past glories of her match- 
less art. Signor Morelli is a born innovator one 
of those men, says Mr. Willard, " who arrive at 
new results, not by trying to be original, but by an 
inward compulsion which will not allow them to be 
other than original." His influence was felt at 
Naples as early as 1865, lending a distinctive tone 
and tendency to the painters immediately about 
him. By 1875 the flocking of young men to his 
atelier for instruction surpassed anything that had 
been seen in Italy since Canova's time ; and in 
1880 an Italian jury awarded him a diploma pro- 
nouncing him the leader of Italian art a crucial

test of admitted supremacy in a land where pro- 
fessional jealousies still survive with mediaeval vir- 
ulence. Mr. Willard gives an interesting account 
of Signor Morelli's chequered, and at one time even 
stormy, career, of his up-hill fight against poverty, 
public indifference, and the academic narrowness 
of critics and juries. The criticisms and apprecia- 
tions are temperate and scholarly ; and the several 
fine plates with which the volume is enriched cer- 
tainly bear out Mr. Willard's generous estimates. 
Signor Morelli's themes are mostly Scriptural ; and 
one may almost fancy, in studying his ample and 
dignified compositions, that they are from the brush 
of some belated member of that noble company of 
bygone Italian masters whose works are at once the 
pride and the despair of their successors. 

A good volume of Mr - . Lewis E - <f ates > of Harvard Uni- 
prose selections from versity, has edited a volume of " Se- 

Cardinal Newman. l ect i ons f rom t h e Prose Writings of 

John Henry Cardinal Newman " (Holt), and thereby 
placed in the hands of students of English a choice 
series of examples from one of the greatest masters 
of English prose. The selections are so arranged 
as " to give something like a connected account in 
Newman's own words of his theory of life and of 
his justification of it." The book has thus a two- 
fold value, in that it brings to the student of style 
a model and an exemplar particularly needful in 
this age of feverishly clever writing, and to the stu- 
dent of culture a bird's-eye view of the work of one 
of the subtlest and most imaginative minds of the 
nineteenth century. The selections include many 
passages from the " Idea of a University," the 
" Apologia," the novels, sermons, and controversial 
essays. We are particularly glad to find among 
the chapters the inimitable satire on " Count Potem- 
kin and John Bull," and a number of those passages 
in which Newman, more eloquently perhaps than 
any of his contemporaries, pleaded for the higher 
aims of education and the nobler ideals of human- 
istic scholarship. And we are almost tempted to 
say that the introductory essay supplied by Mr. 
Gates is as valuable as any of the remaining con- 
tents of the book. At least we should hardly know 
where else to look (unless possibly in Mr. Hutton's 
pages) for so keenly analytical and warmly appre- 
ciative an estimate of the stylistic and rhetorical 
characteristics of Newman's work. This essay is a 
masterpiece of criticism, and makes us await impa- 
tiently further work of the sort from Mr. Gates. 

Excellent service has been done to 
the reading public by Mrs. Millicent 
Garrett Fawcett in giving us a " Life 
of Her Majesty Queen Victoria" (Roberts Bros.). 
It is a sympathetic and able biography of one who 
is at the same time a great ruler and a great woman. 
The idea is too common among Americans that the 
Queen is but a figure-head for the government, that 
she is without power or even much influence. This 
unpretending little book will correct that error in 



Syllabub

the minds of all who read it. She is shown to be 
an exceedingly hard worker in public affairs, exer- 
cising constant supervision over the greater interests 
of the Kingdom, though taking the department of 
foreign affairs under her special superintendence. 
She is also shown to be a thoroughly trained states- 
man whose judgments deserve the respectful con- 
sideration of the ablest ministers. The woman as 
portrayed in this book deserves our admiration no 
less than the monarch. And her influence, with 
that of her noble husband, in raising the tone of so- 
cial life in England, cannot be sufficiently praised. 
Mrs. Fawcett has set forth the details of the train- 
ing of the Queen for her work, her accession and 
marriage, her beautiful domestic life, the character 
and influence of Prince Alfred, her connection with 
the government, and the points where she has espe- 
cially touched public affairs, in such a way as to give 
a true and vivid picture of one of the world's great 

rulers. 

In her "Side Talks with Girls" 
(Scribner), " Ruth Ashmore " offers 
herself as guide, philosopher, and 
friend in general, to the " American Girl " to whom 
her book is gushingly dedicated. We should be 
sorry to think that this production could be taken 
as a fair gauge of the culture and mental capacity 
of any large proportion of those to whom it is ad- 
dressed. The drift of the book is indicated in such 
chapter-headings as : "The Social Life of a Girl," 
"A Girl's Religious Life," "What Shall a Girl 
Read," "The Girl Who Uses Slang," "My Sweet- 
heart and I," and so on. We subjoin a specimen 
or so of the text : " . . . and then while your heart 
is full of the heroism of a man, you will elect to 
read a new and very full life of the martyrdom of 
Marie Antoinette." " A book with pictures is always 
doubly interesting, and I fancy my girls are like 
me in that respect." "... from the beginning 
of the world men have never loved the women who 
were slangy in their manners, but rather the woman 
who represents what a French writer calls the ' eter- 
nal feminine.' " " Give [your sweetheart] plenty 
of the bread and butter of affectionate friendship, 
and every now and then add to it a spoonful of the 
marmalade of love." One tolerates, under protest, 
such sorry stuff as the foregoing in the newspapers 
and in ladies' journals ; but its intrusion between 
book-covers should be resented. 

M. Saint-Amanda We take Pleasure in calling atten- 
accountofthe tion to a fresh volume, "The Revo- 
Revoiution of '48. lution o f 18 48 " (Scribner ), from the 
unflagging pen of M. Imbert de Saint- Amand. M. 
de Saint-Amand's now cpmprehensive series of his- 
torical sketches are not only as pleasant reading as 
anything in their way we know of, but they render 
writers and special students the solid service of 
bringing handily within three feet or so of shelf- 
room the pith and marrow, the " purple patches," 
so to speak, of the generally inaccessible mass of 
memoirs, diaries, letters, etc., in which the period

treated by M. de Saint-Amand especially abounds. 
The present volume is a readable one, full of anec- 
dote and portraiture, and re-telling with graphic 
effect the homely yet touching story of Louis Phil- 
ippe's abdication, how (to adopt the poet Heine's 
version of the matter) the good old bourgeois king, 
finding that France did not want him, and resolutely 
refusing to fire on his unruly people, tucked his 
wife under one arm and his umbrella under the 
other, hailed a cab, and drove away from Paris, its 
mobs and its barricades, forever. It is needless to 
say that M. Saint-Amand, a friend of the old regime, 
accords French royalty a more stately final exit. 
There are four portraits in the volume, which is 
admirably translated by Elizabeth Gilbert Martin. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

A new edition of Dr. Dickson's translation of Momm- 
sen's "History of Rome " is at hand (Scribner). The 
translation has been revised throughout, and thus 
brought into conformity with the latest (eighth) Ger- 
man edition. " As compared with the first English edi- 
tion," says the translator, " the more considerable alter- 
ations of addition, omission, or substitution amount, I 
should think, to well-nigh a hundred pages." The text 
has been broken up into paragraphs further than here- 
tofore, and provided with marginal headings. Last of 
all, we may note the greatly enlarged index. 

Among recent reprints of standard fiction we note 
the following: "Two on a Tower," by Mr. Thomas 
Hardy, with a preface, an etching, and a map of Wes- 
sex (Harper); "Great Expectations" and "Hard 
Times," making a new volume in the " dollar " Dickens 
(Macmillan) ; Maria Edgeworth's " Ormond," intro- 
duced by Mrs. Ritchie, and Marryat's " Jacob Faith- 
ful," introduced by Mr. David Hannay, both of these 
published in the Macmillan series of old-fashioned nov- 
els; and the first two volumes of a neat new edition 
(Roberts) of the works of John Gait, containing " Annals 
of the Parish " and " The Ayrshire Legatees," edited 
by Mr. D. S. Meldrum, and introduced by Mr. S. R. 
Crockett. 

A dissertation by Dr. Edwin W. Bowen, offered for 
a degree at the Johns Hopkins University, is entitled 
" An Historical Study of the e-Vowel in Accented Syl- 
lables in English." It is published by Messrs. John 
Murphy & Co., Baltimore. Dr. Bowen has also re- 
printed in pamphlet form, from the " Virginia School 
Journal," a paper on " The Relics of Umlaut in Liv- 
ing English." Both of these studies are creditable illus- 
trations of the philological scholarship of our younger 
university men, and are examples of a class of publica- 
tions that have multiplied rapidly of late. 

From Owens to Passelewe is the range of the latest 
volume numbered forty- three, of the "Dictionary of 
National Biography " (Macmillan). Most readers will 
turn quickly to Mr. Leslie Stephen's articles on Thomas 
Paine (ten pages), and William Paley (six pages), and 
to Mr. Stanley Lane Poole's article on Edward H. 
Palmer. The longest biography in the volume is 
awarded to Charles Stewart Parnell (twenty pages), 
and is unsigned. The statement is made that the ar- 
ticle is based in part upon private information.

Many of the most distinguished educators and scholars 
of the country will participate. 

The Board of Regents of the University of California 
having decided that a location in the immediate vicinity 
of San Francisco is preferable to the University's pres- 
ent home at Berkeley, Mayor Sutro has presented to the 
University a site of thirteen acres south of Golden Gate 
Park for the erection of the new college buildings. 

The following lines have been engraved upon Hux-

" And if there be no meeting past the grave, 
If all is darkness, silence, yet 't is rest. 
Be not afraid, ye waiting hearts that weep ! 
For God still giveth his beloved sleep. 
And if an endless sleep he wills, so best ! "

deemed most expedient." The first work undertaken 
by the Guild will be the publication of the poems of 
Miss Ina D. Coolbrith, which will be issued during the 
coming holiday season. 

A new play by " Michael Field " will be entitled, "At- 
tila, my Attila." It deals with the strange and despe- 
rate adventures of Honoria, daughter of the famous 
Empress Galla Placidia. This young princess may 
reasonably be regarded as the New Woman of the fifth 
century, and it is from this point of view that Michael 
Field has presented her audacities and their punishment. 

Mr. Theodore Stanton is preparing an illustrated ar- 
ticle on " The Home of the Gue'rins," Maurice and 
Eugenie having lived and died in the part of Langue- 
doc where the Stantons have their summer home. Two 
female relatives of the Gue'rins are still living at the 
Chateau du Cayla (described in Matthew Arnold's 
"Essays in Criticism"). Mr. Stanton has met them 
both, and they have given him some interesting facts 
for use in his forthcoming article. 

Dr. Elliott Coues has just completed his new edition 
of Zebulon M. Pike's " Explorations in the West and 
Southwest." In it he has gone in great detail into the 
" Headwaters of the Mississippi " question, and of the 
claims made by explorers of ancient and modern times. 
Those interested in Western history and discovery will 
await with interest the appearance of Dr. Coues's work. 
He claims to have sifted every conceivable source of in- 
formation on the subject, and to have settled the Mis- 
sissippian question for all time. 

Mr. Theodore Stanton writes to a friend in this coun- 
try: "The venerable M. Barthe'lemy Saint-Hilaire, the 
distinguished Life Member of the French Senate, pre- 
sents a wonderful example of intellectual activity at an 
advanced age. In August he celebrated his ninetieth 
birthday. A few months before, he published a large 
three-volume ' Life of Victor Cousin,' and a week ago 
he wrote me in a firm, legible hand: 'I can still work, 
I am thankful to say. I am busy at this moment on 
the second edition of Cousin's " Plato," and I hope to 
issue the first volume at the end of the year.' " 

" The Harvard Graduates' Magazine " for September 
has for its leading feature Sir Frederick Pollock's great 
address on " The Vocation of the Common Law," de- 
livered last June at Harvard. The report of the Alumni 
Dinner, at which Professor Norton presided, is also 
given, and proves extremely interesting reading. Among 
other festivities, there were speeches from the Chair- 
man, the President, Governor Greenhalge, Sir Fred- 
erick Pollock, Mr. Charles Francis Adams, and Mr. 
Joseph Jefferson, the latter three having been pre- 
viously made the recipients of honorary degrees. Pro- 
fessor Norton was particularly happy when, introducing 
Mr. Adams, he quoted the remarks of the Principal of 
the University of Louvain, as reported in " The Vicar 
of Wakefield." " ' You see me, young man, I never 
learned Greek, and I do n't find that I ever missed it. 
I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek; I 
have had ten thousand florins a year without Greek, 
and I can eat heartily without Greek'; in short, con- 
tinued he, ' as I do n't know Greek, I do not believe 
there is any use in it.' " Mr. Adams, in the speech that 
followed, discreetly avoided making any allusion to so 
delicate a subject. 

Among the holiday books of last year was a hand- 
some one called " Hoofs, Claws, and Antlers," issued 



in Denver, and containing a striking collection of pho- 
tographs of wild animals, purporting to have been taken 
in their native haunts among the trees and rocks, by 
an old hunter and his wife, one of them covering the 
wild creature with a rifle while the other got a " snap 
shot " with the camera. The volume contained portraits 
also of this enterprising couple, and had an enthusiastic 
Introduction by that experienced sportsman Mr. Theo- 
dore Roosevelt. The book had a considerable vogue, 
and some of its pictures were reproduced in the pages 
of a popular New York magazine. It is now stated by 
a Colorado paper that the whole thing is a hoax a 
"clever fake." The animals were not wild at all; they 
were not even alive; they were only stuffed specimens 
from the extensive collection of a Denver taxidermist, 
taken out into the plains and mountains and skilfully 
" placed " for the conniving photographer. Even the 
veteran hunter and his wife appear to have been stuffed; 
and so too, according to the Colorado journal, was Mr. 
Roosevelt. 

Sir Walter Besant thus writes in " The Author " of 
literary affairs in Chicago. " A great novelist, accord- 
ing to the ' Times,' has appeared in the city of Chicago. 
I am glad to hear it, because, two years ago, I pointed 
out without being believed that there exists in Chi- 
cago a society of literary students who are working seri- 
ously and earnestly with the ambition of producing 
something real. There is also at Chicago a rich and 
flourishing university, with a great many professors on 
a great many subjects, and a great many students. 
There are good schools in Chicago ; there is a good 
literary paper in Chicago. There are libraries, mu- 
seums, art collections, concerts, theatres, and, in fact, all 
the necessary aids to culture. When, in so great a city, 
we find a number of people steadily cultivating every 
form of art, it is pretty certain that, before long, one 
or more will come to the front. The man who has come 
is Mr. Henry B. Fuller, and the name of his book is 
' With the Procession.' My prophecy was held up to 
scorn at the time, especially by those who still think 
that Chicago is a small collection of log huts, with a 
saloon or two, populated by gaunt men with revolvers 
and bowie knives. I can only hope that the book is as 
good as the ' Times ' correspondent thinks." 

Seven new leaflets have just been added to the " Old 
South " series, all relating to English Puritanism and 
the Commonwealth. They are numbered 58 to 64, and 
are as follows : No. 58, Hooper's Letters to Bullinger ; 
59, Sir John Eliot's " Apology for Socrates "; 60, Ship- 
money Papers ; 61, Pym's Speech against Strafford ; 62, 
Cromwell's Second Speech ; 63, Milton's " Free Com- 
monwealth"; 64, Sir Henry Vane's Defence. There 
are many earlier leaflets in the series relating to the 
same period, including Vane's " Healing Question," the 
Petition of Rights, the Grand Remonstrance, the Scot- 
tish National Covenant, the Agreement of the People, 
the Instrument of Government, and Cromwell's First 
Speech. With these Old South leaflets, which are sold 
for five cents a copy, just enough to cover their cost, 
our students can come into immediate touch with the 
men of the English Commonwealth and the great scenes 
in which they acted. These men and events were as 
truly a part of American as of English history, as it has 
been a main object of the Old South lectures of the 
present year, on the Puritans in Old England, to point 
out. It is pleasant to know that these leaflets are com- 
ing into general use in the schools and being circulated 
throughout the country.

AN ACCOUNT OF PALMYRA AND ZENOBIA,

DESERT. By Dr. WILLIAM WRIGHT, author of " The Em- 
pire of the Hittites," etc. Fully illustrated. 8vo, cloth 
extra, gilt top, $2.50. 

" Palmyra is chiefly known for its ruins and its traditions of Zeno- 
bia's illustrious reign. To both of these Dr. Wright does more justice 
than is commonly expected from travellers' tales. He has occupied him- 
self with original research and the study of inscriptions, so that his 
narrative has a very different style from that of the vapid, second-hand 
and tenth-rate literature of the majority of unprofessional travellers. 
Much entertainment as well as much information may be found in this 
modest volume." New York Times, Sept. 15, 1895. 

" A stirring narrative by Dr. William Wright. Besides a brief history 
of the ancient cities, with a glance at the architecture, art, and indus- 
tries of their people, the author tells us how they look to-day. The vol- 
ume is handsomely illustrated, and the ruins in the two great cities are 
portrayed in a series of artistic engravings that tell a story in them- 
selves. " Commercial Advertiser, Sept. 11, 1895.

THE MODERATE MAN OF THE XVI. CENTURY. The Story of his Life, as told in his own Letters, in those of his Friends and 
of his Enemies, and from Official Documents. By RUTH PUTNAM. Fully Illustrated. 2 vols., 8vo, gilt tops, 3.75. 
" It is doubtful if any previous works on this interesting character are more readable and accurate than this of Ruth Putnam. Her book 

shows a vast amount of intelligent research among original documents, and an unbiassed, thoughtful, discriminating study of the histories of her 

subject." New York Times. 

" It is certain that the author's book will be read with pleasure, for it throws new light upon the struggle for religious civil liberty in the 

Netherlands, and renders it easier for us to detect in the most conspicuous figure of its earlier stages the real lineaments of the man." ^V. 1". Sun. 

The Winning of the West. 1769 = 1790. 

By THEODORE ROOSEVELT, author of " Hunting Trips of a Ranchman," etc. With Maps. 3 vols. (sold separately), 8vo, f 7.50. 

"... A lucid, interesting narrative, written with the impartial soberness of history, warmed and colored by a lively imagination. . . . The 
work is admirably done, and forms a valuable contribution to the history of the country." London Spectator. 

"For the first time the whole field has been covered in one work by one accomplished and thoroughly equipped writer, whose book will rank 
among American historical writings of the first order." Critic. 

A Literary History of the English People. 

FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE PRESENT DAY. By J. J. JUSSERAND, author of "The English Novel in the Time of 
Shakespeare," " Piers Plowman," etc. To be completed in three parts, each part forming one volume. Sold separately. 

Part I. From the Origins to the Renaissance. With frontispiece. 8vo, gilt top, $3.50. 
Part II. From the Renaissance to Pope. (In press.) 
Part III. From Pope to the Present Day. 

"M. Jusserand's qualifications for the task which he has undertaken are of a high order. There are few foreigners who have so intimate a 
knowledge of English life. He has already gained great distinction as an original investigator in more than one period of English literary history ; 
and he shows a degree of sympathetic insight which is seldom met with in critics of our literature." London Athenteum. 

"The book bears witness on every page to having been written by one whose mind was overflowing with information, and whose heart was in 
abounding sympathy with his work." New York Times. 

Personal Recollections of War Times. 1861 = 1865. 

By ALBERT GALLATIN RIDDLE, Member of the House of Representatives from the 19th District of Ohio. 8vo, $2.50. 

" I have just been reading Mr. Riddle's ' Recollections of War Times,' and have found it both informing and fascinating. It seems to me that 
for fidelity of stroke and vividness of color, it compares well with any other sketch, by a contemporary, of our second and perhaps greatest heroic 
age." Moses Coil Tyler. 

Louis XIV., 

AND THE ZENITH OF THE FRENCH MONARCHY. By ARTHUR HASSALL, M.A., Senior Student of Christ Church College, 
Oxford. Being No. 14 in " Heroes of the Nations " Series. Fully Illustrated. Cloth, $1.50 ; half leather, $1.75. 
" We are inclined to call this a model piece of work in its class, brief without being meagre, and full without going into needless details. The 

author never loses his own clear judgment nor the historical perspective and relations of his subjects, and the basis of knowledge on which the 

work rests is thorough and critical." Independent. 

" Mr. Hassall treats his subject in a most attractive and interesting way. The book is a history of Louis' reign, simply and clearly told, with 

judicial fairness and historical appreciation." Philadelphia Times. 

Julian, Philosopher and Emperor, 

AND THE LAST STRUGGLE OF PAGANISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY. By ALICE GARDNER, Lecturer in Newnham College, 
Cambridge. Being No. 13 in " Heroes of the Nations " Series. Fully Illustrated. Cloth, $1.50 ; half leather, gilt tops, 81.75. 
" One of the most admirable of the volumes included in the ' Heroes of the Nations ' Series. ... To the author was intrusted a most difficult 

subject, and but few English scholars could have treated it with more thoroughness, skill, and discrimination."" M. W. H." in the New York Sun. 
" Miss Gardner has written her study with as full a knowledge of Julian and his time as it is possible to obtain. Her ability, erudition, and 

the vast research that she made to prepare her work, place her study of Julian far in advance of any life of him that has ever been written." 

New York Times. 

Story of Vedic India, 

As EMBODIED PRINCIPALLY IN THE RIG-VEDA. By Z. A. RAGOZIN, member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain 

and Ireland, author of "The Story of Chaldea," etc. Being the new volume in the "Story of the Nations " Series, 

Illustrated. Large 12mo, cloth, $1.50 ; half leather, $1.75. 

" The author of this book knows how to write ; she catches the points which are most interesting, and presents to us only things which we 
wish to know. . . ." Literary World. 

" This admirable manual of the sacred books of India. . . . She develops her subjects historically, and presents a vivid and sympathetic 
description of the peoples and physical characteristics of the East." Philadelphia Press.

A NEW CHILD'S STORY 

BY 

Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett. 

Her longest and most notable Juvenile 
since "FAUNTLEROY." 




A Story of the City Beautiful. 
WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY MR. R. B. BIRCH. 

Square 8vo, Uniform with " Fauntleroy." 
Price, $1.50. 



In " Two Little Pilgrims' Progress " Mrs. Burnett 
is at her best. It is the story of two children a 
little boy and girl brought up on a Western farm, 
where they have been neglected by their aunt with 
whom they live, and who find their chief happiness 
in reading Bunyan's " Pilgrim's Progress " in a corner 
of the barn. Just then they hear of what must have 
been a glimpse of fairyland to so many Western chil- 
dren, the White City of the Chicago Exhibition, and 
they make up their minds to take their small savings 
and go to see the wonder. This is their pilgrims' 
progress, and their adventures, which in the end re- 
sult most happily, are told by Mrs. Burnett in her 
well-known delightful manner. It is sure to prove a 
prime favorite among books for the young, and will 
rival even " Fauntleroy " in popularity.

A NEWSPAPER MYTH. 

A few months ago it was reported that a 
certain instructor in the University of Chicago 
was about to sever his connection with that in- 
stitution. Such incidents are a part of the 
normal life of every university, and this par- 
ticular incident did not seem to call for any 
comment on the part of the public. But a sec- 
tion of the newspaper press, that stern guar- 
dian of public morality, found in the matter 
the germ of a possible sensation, and by its 
familiar methods of innuendo, baseless asser- 
tion, and reckless reasoning, proceeded to ex- 
ploit the case. It so happened that the in- 
structor in question had been at work in the 
departments of economic and social science, 
and had in various ways brought himself before 
the public, outside of his university teaching, 
as a student of trusts, monopolies, and indus- 
trial combinations, and was credited with pro- 
nounced opinions upon those subjects. But 
sinister reflection the founder and chief 
benefactor of the University of Chicago was a 
man firmly associated in public opinion with 
one of the most gigantic of industrial monopo- 
lies. Obviously, here were all the materials 
for a first-class sensation. To the limited sort 
of intelligence that presides over the average 
newspaper, a theory of the facts presented 
itself ready-made. Nothing could be clearer. 
The founder of the University was also the 
head of a well-known trust ; others of its bene- 
factors were wealthy men and consequently in 
close sympathy with the plutocratic view of 
society ; here was an instructor, supported by 
their endowments, and expressing opinions that 
they must regard as peculiarly obnoxious ; it 
was a plain case of an attempt to throttle free 
thought and shape the teaching of a great pub- 
lic institution in accordance with the unholy 
views of those whose wealth had created it. 

This theory of the situation, reckless as it 
was, got considerable currency through the 
efforts of the newspapers that had given it 
the sanction of their prejudice. To an impar- 
tial outsider, knowing nothing of the spirit and 
organization of the university thus brought to 
the bar of journalistic opinion, it may have 
presented itself as one of the many possible

[Oct. 16, 



reasons why an educational institution should 
seek to dispense with the services of one of its 
instructors. To anyone at all familiar with the 
attitude of the University of Chicago toward 
the general question of Lehrfreiheit, it was of 
all possible reasons the one least likely to be 
supported by the facts. Upon that great prin- 
ciple, the position of the University has from 
the start been absolutely unequivocal. The 
character of its faculty, its courses, and its 
methods has been such as to preclude the notion 
that it aimed in its teaching at anything less 
than the fullest freedom of discussion and in- 
vestigation. Bigotry, partisanship, and secta- 
rianism have in vain sought to obtain a foot- 
hold within its quadrangles. Its theological 
school, indeed, teaches a particular form of 
theological dogmatism, frankly enough pro- 
claimed, and it is difficult to see how a theo- 
logical school could do otherwise. Even in 
Germany, Lehrfreiheit does not go so far as 
to say that the theological faculties of the uni- 
versities shall not be distinctly Catholic or 
Protestant. But even the theological students 
at the University of Chicago get their Semitics, 
their classics, and their philosophy, for the 
most part, from the regular university depart- 
ments concerned with these subjects, depart- 
ments so liberally organized that it would be 
ridiculous to charge them with the least sec- 
tarian bias. 

All these facts, familiar as they are to those 
who have studied the organization and ob- 
served the workings of this newest of our great 
universities, are not sufficiently well known to 
the public intelligence to fortify it against such 
an appeal to prejudice as has recently been 
made. The newspaper myth which is the sub- 
ject of these remarks was given such currency, 
and found so wide an acceptance among peo- 
ple who are willing to let the newspapers do 
their thinking for them, that the President of 
the University, at the July Convocation, thought 
it best to recognize the myth in question to the 
extent of making a very distinct public state- 
ment that the University had never sought to 
influence the teaching of its instructors or to 
abridge in any way their intellectual freedom. 
A statement of this sort should, of course, have 
put an end to the discussion of the matter ; but 
newspaper myths are not so easily discredited. 
The growth of such a myth offers an interest- 
ing subject for psychological study. Put forth 
at first as a plausible hypothesis, it speedily 
assumes the shape of an incontrovertible fact, 
and is taken as a new fixed basis for further 



reasoning. Many of our leading newspapers, 
East and West, taking for granted the suppres- 
sion of free discussion by the authorities of the 
University of Chicago, have been moralizing 
all summer long upon the awful consequences 
of a higher education controlled by class influ- 
ences, and indulging in dismal vaticinations of 
a time when our university faculties shall have 
become mere hirelings of an unscrupulous plu- 
tocracy. The peculiarly impudent feature of 
the whole discussion has been the frequently- 
reiterated assertion that the University author- 
ities had made no reply to the charges brought 
against them. This assertion, which we have 
seen in a good many reputable newspapers dur- 
ing the past three months, must be accounted 
for in one of two ways. If made in actual 
ignorance of the explicit denial of last July, it 
must be taken as a fresh illustration of the dis- 
graceful recklessness characteristic of the edi- 
torial management of too many of our news- 
papers. If, on the other hand, it has been 
made with knowledge of the facts, it merely 
illustrates that cardinal maxim of journalistic 
ethics in accordance with which a newspaper, 
having once made itself responsible for a state- 
ment of any sort, is in self-respect bound to 
insist upon its truth, even if it be demonstra- 
bly false, unless there is too great a risk of 
being detected in the lie. Neither of these 
explanations, judged by other than journalistic 
standards, is very creditable ; but no third ex- 
planation is under the circumstances possible. 
It is always a serious question to determine 
to what extent popular clamor of this sort, 
directed against a public man or a public insti- 
tution, should be recognized by its object. Most 
of the anonymous scribbling upon such subjects 
in the public press is obviously undeserving of 
the slightest attention. Dignity and self-respect 
nearly always prompt one to ignore such at- 
tacks altogether. But there are cases in which, 
when all the circumstances are considered, it 
seems that some notice ought to be taken, even 
of a foolish popular opinion. At all events, 
the President of the University of Chicago 
deemed it advisable, when the University came 
to Convocation the first of the present month, 
to reiterate, with greater emphasis and ampli- 
tude, his declaration of three months before. 
He said : 

" In view of the many incorrect and misleading utter- 
ances which have recently been published in reference 
to the policy of the University of Chicago in its rela- 
tion to its teaching staff, it seems wise to make the 
following statement: 

" 1. From the beginning the University has believed 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

in the policy of appointing to positions in the same de- 
partment men who represent different points of view. 
It is evident, therefore, that no instructor in the univer- 
sity has been or will be asked to separate himself from 
the university because his views upon a particular ques- 
tion differ from those of another member of the same 
department. 

" 2. From the beginning of the university there has 
never been an occasion for condemning the utterance 
of any professor upon any subject, nor has any objec- 
tion been taken in any case to the teachings of a pro- 
fessor. 

" 3. The university has been, in a conspicuous way, 
the recipient of large gifts of money from wealthy men. 
In absolutely no single case has any man, who has given 
as much as one dollar to the university, sought by word 
or act, either directly or indirectly, to control or even 
to influence the policy of the university in reference 
to the teachings of its professors in the departments 
of political economy, history, political science or soci- 
ology. 

"This public statement is made because the coun- 
ter statement has been published far and wide, and be- 
cause it is clear that a serious injury will be done the 
cause of higher education if the impression should pre- 
vail that in a university, as distinguished from a college, 
there is not the largest possible freedom of expression 
a freedom entirely unhampered by either theological 
or monetary considerations." 

This is, we should think, explicit enough, and 
may even be said to mark a noteworthy epoch 
in the history of American higher education. 
Does it dispose of the newspaper myth that we 
have been talking about ? Probably not ; peo- 
ple of intelligence did not believe in the myth 
anyhow, and most of those who did believe in 
it will never see the disclaimer. As for the 
newspapers, they may continue to assert that 
no denial of the charge has been made ; or they 
may change their tactics, and demand all the 
facts in the case, be they of public concern or 
not. Some of them, in fact, have already taken 
the latter course. 

Since the publication of the declaration above 
mentioned, the instructor about whom all this 
pother has been raised has supplied the news- 
papers with a statement of his position. We 
cannot but regard this as an unwise proceeding, 
for the statement is not wholly ingenuous, and 
does not contravene in any essential respect the 
utterances of the President of the University 
upon the principle of freedom in teaching. The 
public is nowise concerned with the reasons 
for which the retirement under discussion was 
made, as long as those reasons have nothing to 
do with Lehrfreiheit. We are assured that 
this is the case by an emphatic and authorita- 
tive pronouncement, and there the question 
ends for all reasonable persons. To demand, 
as some newspapers still seem inclined to do, a 



statement of the specific reasons for which the 
retirement was made, is the sheerest impu- 
dence, and even to recognize such a demand 
would be a derogation from dignity with which 
the University is not likely to become charge- 
able. 

Eeaders of THE DIAL do not need to be re- 
minded that we have always stood steadfast in 
defense of the freedom of University teaching. 
That fact alone, to say nothing of the further 
fact that the instructor whose case has just 
been under discussion is a valued contributor 
to our review columns, would preclude any de- 
fense on our part of the university, were we 
not convinced that the principle of Lehrfrei- 
heit is fully recognized by that institution, and 
that it has not, in this case or in any other, 
been put in jeopardy. For the newspapers 
that have hatched and fed the mythical mon- 
ster now so desperately .wounded, no condem- 
nation can be too strong. They have given a 
fresh illustration of the apostolic apostrophe, 
" Behold, how great a matter a little fire kin- 
dleth ! " and as far as they have injured the 
University of Chicago in the eyes of those who 
should wish it well, they have no reason to be 
proud of their work. In the case of some of 
the Eastern papers, it has been only too evi- 
dent that jealousy of a Western institution was 
the prime motive of the attack ; in the case of 
the papers nearer home, a spirit of reckless sen- 
sationalism has mainly prompted the attitude 
assumed by them. In either case, the motive 
has been anything but creditable, and it is at 
least pleasant to think that the attack has been 
so obviously prejudiced, if not malicious, that 
it cannot have had any serious influence upon 
public opinion, but has rather strengthened 
than weakened the University with all judi- 
cious minds. 



RECENT PEA THS. 

Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen died on the fourth of 
this month, at his residence in New York. His 
death was entirely unexpected, and came from an 
attack of acute rheumatism of the cardiac muscles. 
He was born September 23, 1848, in Frederiks- 
vaern, Southern Norway, and was educated at Leip- 
zig and Christiania. Graduating from the latter 
university in 1868, he came to America the year 
after, and settled for a while in Chicago, where he 
edited the Scandinavian paper " Fremad." He later 
occupied academic posts at Urbana and Cornell 
Universities, and at Columbia College, with which 
latter institution he has been connected since 1880.

He early acquired a surprising knowledge of the 
English language, and his first publication in En- 
glish had few traces of foreign idiom. The list of 
his publications is a lengthy one, comprising twenty- 
one titles of books, besides many contributions to 
periodical literature. The books, with their dates, 
are "Gunnar" (1874), "A Norseman's Pilgrim- 
age" (1875), "Tales from Two Hemispheres" 
(1876), " Falconberg " and " Goethe and Schiller " 
(1879), "Queen Titania" and " Ilka on the Hill- 
top" (1881), "Idyls of Norway" (1882), "A 
Daughter of the Philistines " (1883), " The Story of 
Norway" (1886), "The Modern Vikings" (1887), 
"Vagabond Tales " (1889 ), " Against Heavy Odds " 
(1890), "The Mammon of Unrighteousness" 
(1891), "Essays on German Literature," "Boyhood 
in Norway," "The Golden Calf" (1892), "Social 
Stragglers" (1893), "A Commentary on Henrik 
Ibsen," "Literary and Social Silhouettes" (1894), 
and "Essays on Scandinavian Literature" (1895). 
Much of this work was pot-boiling, but the best of 
it was well worth doing. As a writer, he was robust 
rather than refined, and a vein of philistinism now 
and then cropped out in his pages. A certain cyni- 
cism, as far as women were concerned, marred some 
of his later books. But he was a remarkable writer, 
and all the more so from his use of a language not 
originally his own. Readers of THE DIAL will re- 
call his frequent contributions to its pages. 

William Wetmore Story, who was born in Salem, 
Mass., February 12, 1819, and who died in Vallom- 
brosa, Italy, on the seventh of this month, was 
almost, if not quite, the dean of our American lit- 
erary guild. He was antedated only by Mrs. Stowe 
(1812), Mr. Parke Godwin (1816), and Mr. Will- 
iam Ellery Channing the second (1818), among 
those still living. The son of a distinguished law- 
yer, he was himself admitted to the bar, and worked 
at the law for ten years. Several volumes of legal 
writings remain to attest his industry in this field. 
But a passionate devotion to art led him, after this 
apprenticeship to an inartistic profession, to leave 
America for Italy in 1848, and to devote his life 
thenceforth mainly to sculpture, in which field he 
achieved the most distinct of his successes. His 
literary work, which served him as a form of recrea- 
tion in his career as an artist, was varied and indi- 
cative of talent and the broadly-cultured mind 
hardly more than that. It comprises " Nero," a 
play ; three collections of poems ; " Roba di Roma," 
a series of " walks and talks about Rome "; " Graf- 
fiti d'ltalia"; " He and She," a "poet's portfolio"; 
"Fiametta." a graceful Italian idyl; "Conversa- 
tions in a Studio "; a series of " Excursions in Art 
and Letters "; and the " Life and Letters of Joseph 
Story," his father. All of this work is pleasing in 
form, although it shows little critical penetration, 
and often displays an unsoundness of judgment that 
would have been impossible to a rigorously-trained 
intellect. But it gives to its author an honorable 
place in our literature, and will probably afford 



considerable pleasure to another generation or two 
of readers. 

Victor Rydberg, who died last month, was prob- 
ably foremost among recent Swedish men of letters, 
with the possible exception of Herr Topelius. He 
was born December 18, 1829, in JonkSping. He 
was educated at Wexio and Lund, and at the former 
place enjoyed the teaching and friendship of Teg- 
ne"r. His first important work was the historical 
novel " The Pirate of the Baltic " (" Fribytaren paa 
Oestersj5n"), published in 1858. The following 
year produced the still more important work " The 
Last Athenian " (" Den Siste Athenienser "). This 
work, with its liberal tendencies and its almost po- 
lemical attitude towards church authority, evoked 
much criticism, and led to the composition of " Christ 
in the Bible " (" Bibelns Lara om Kristus "), " The 
Hebrew Worship of Jehovah " (" Jehovatjensten 
hos Hebreerna"), and " The Magicians of the Mid- 
dle Ages" (" Medeltidens Magi"). A sojourn in 
Rome in 1873 74 was the inspiration of several 
thoughtful works. He also wrote lyrics, and made 
a highly successful translation of " Faust." He 
was one of the eighteen members of the Swedish 
Academy, and a professor in the Superior School of 
Stockholm. 



THE RETROGRESSION IN ENGLISH. 

" The restoration of English to much of its old- 
time valiency " is ably, instructively, and entertain- 
ingly discussed in an article on " The Renascence 
in English," in the October issue of " The Forum." 
But while the writer, Mr. Richard Burton, does not 
ignore the debt which English owes to other lan- 
guages for a large portion of its vocabulary, and 
acknowledges that " the return to Old English ex- 
pression " must always be " within limits of com- 
mon sense and controlled by custom and conven- 
ience," yet it may well seem to some of his readers 
that he looks for too great an enrichment of our 
speech through a return to native English words 
and turns of expression which have long ago dem- 
onstrated their inferiority to foreign importations, 
and perhaps even their uncouth and unmanageable 
nature, by allowing themselves to be crowded out 
of the language by substitutes of greater flexibility 
or euphony. 

We are told by the writer that the German lan- 
guage, the historic cousin of the English, " owing 
to its different history has kept its native powers 
in relative purity; while English, subjected to more 
disturbing influences in the Norman Conquest and 
the classic Renascence, has diverged far wider from 
its normal physiognomy and its original tenden- 
cies." As a result of these disturbing influences, 
we are subjected to the necessity of saying preface 
instead of foreword, unless we are willing to seem 
odd and affected, and we have domesticated " such 
a repulsive foreign importation as massa ere. "in stead

of enjoying the privilege of using the German com- 
pound, blood-bath (blutbad). We are assured that 
" had our tongue encountered a happier linguistic 
experience," we might now be using such expres- 
sive and self-explanatory, though uncouth and 
homely, words as the above. 

But let us look, in passing, at this " repulsive for- 
eign importation," massacre. To be sure, its pres- 
ent form is French, and it points back to the mediae- 
val Latin mazacrium ; but its real origin is Teu- 
tonic, and not Latin, into which latter language it 
is an importation from northern Europe. It ap- 
pears in the German metzger, the provincial Ger- 
man metzgern and metzgen, the Old High German 
meizan, and the Gothic mditan. With a slightly 
altered spelling it would become an excellent En- 
glish word of purest lineage. 

Let us rather paraphrase the passage quoted 
above, and say that German, owing to its less for- 
tunate history, has retained all its provincialisms, 
while English, wrought upon by more wide-reaching 
influences in the Norman Conquest and the classic 
Renascence, has freed itself of the purely insular 
and local in its vocabulary and structure, and be- 
come, in a sense true of no other tongue, a world- 
language. The Norman element in the English 
language gives it that power of precision which is 
so characteristic of the French, and which explains 
why the latter is so peculiarly fitted for the use of 
mathematicians and scientists, while, on the other 
hand, and as a necessary consequence, it is never 
less at home than in the flights of poetry or the pro- 
foundness of philosophy. From northern Europe 
we gain to use the words of Professor C. C. Ever- 
ett, in his " Science of Thought " " the richness 
and fulness which spring from the vital presence of 
roots whose meaning is not yet exhausted but which 
are ever ready for new uses, and suggest more than 
they strictly express. Such language is fitted for 
poetry and philosophy and all the higher uses of 
the imagination." * This very opulence unfits the 
German language and the Germanic element in our 
own language for the strictness of science. Vague 
and sometimes ridiculous are the scientific terms of 
the Teuton : coal-stuff \ sour-stuff, water-stuff, and 
stifle-stuff sound queerly enough to any but a Ger- 
man chemist, however much poetry and philosophy 
may delight in such word-formation from within. 
The English language, occupying as it does, with 
respect to this power of word-formation, an inter- 
mediate position between the French, all of whose 
roots are as dead as so many dry sticks and as un- 
able to grow together, and the German, whose roots 
are still pulsating with life, possesses many of the 
advantages, while it avoids many of the defects, of 
each. 

The peculiar excellence and distinctive charac- 
teristic of our tongue is its wealth of vocabulary and 
the variety of its phraseology, its ability to assume 
at will the light graceful flow of the Romance lan-

guages, or the slower and heavier measure of the 
north-European tongues. It is a language most 
admirably adapted, from the very nature and his- 
tory of its formation, to voice our joyful moods and 
to express our more serious thoughts. In it the 
sunny South and the cloudy Northland meet and 
unite. By all means cultivate the Old English ele- 
ment in our speech, and hold fast to what northern 
Europe has contributed to it ; but do not despise 
and allow to become obsolete all that lighter, more 
flexible and moi-e musical element which the south- 
ern races have given for our use. The writer of 
the article under discussion claims, and not without 
reason, that native English words and formations 
are more "virile." (Why, then, not use the good 
Old English word manly f) He also maintains that 
they open to the poet "larger possibilities for mel- 
ody and harmony." Without dwelling on the cu- 
rious fact that he has expressed these poetic possi- 
bilities in a string, of Latin and Greek derivatives, 
we may yet question whether any language, or ele- 
ment of a language, of north-European origin and 
growth, will prove its superiority, in point of mel- 
ody and harmony, to the south-European languages 
and the Romance element of our own English as 
spoken to-day. 

To turn to the modern developments of science, 
and the increasingly prominent part which scientific 
terms play, not only in our daily conversation and 
in our technical literature, but also in the imagery 
of our poetry and fiction, what could we do without 
the French and Latin and Greek words which we 
have made our own, and which have become almost 
as familiar and necessary as mother, father, hearth, 
and hornet Why, then, deplore the combination 
of these Romance with the older Teutonic elements 
in our language, a union which makes it superior 
to either French or German taken alone, and gives 
it no small degree of the power and usefulness of 
both taken together ? One might as reasonably ad- 
vocate the uprooting of those Old English radicals 
which, however admirably fitted for purposes of 
poetry and philosophy, are worse than useless when 
we turn our conversation to the telautograph, the 
kinetoscope, alternating currents, and electric mo- 
tors. 

The genius of a people portrays itself in the lan- 
guage spoken by that people ; and, conversely, a 
language tends to mould the character of those who 
speak it. As our tongue has drawn abundantly 
from all that northern and all that southern Europe 
has to offer, so it is spoken by a many-sided race, 
as able to conquer and colonize the habitable globe 
as its speech is to spread over large areas of both 
hemispheres. If in-breeding be injurious to ani- 
mals and plants, and sure to result at last in the ex- 
tinction of the in-bred species, why may it not be 
equally harmful for languages to depend, to any 
considerable extent, on growth from within? In- 
stead of hoping for a renascence of a pure unmixed 
Old English, let us continue to engraft on the par-

ent stock all that is best in other tongues. It is 
thus that English has grown from the time of the 
Norman Conquest, when it was spoken by a few 
thousand semi-barbarians, to the present time, when 
it is the language, or, at least, is understood by, 
nearly three hundred millions of people. It is its 
glory and charm that it has taken of the best that 
other languages had to give ; it has profited by their 
experience and adopted freely of their words and 
idioms, without surrendering anything of worth in 
its native growth. 

Let us examine some of the passages from mod- 
ern writers, quoted as illustrating this " renascence 
in English." From Mr. Kipling we read the fol- 
lowing : 

" As he spoke the fog was blown into shreds, and we 
saw the sea, gray with mud, rolling on every side of us 
and empty of all life. Then in one spot it bubbled and 
became like the pot of ointment that the Bible speaks 
of. From that wide-ringed trouble a Thing came up 
a gray and red Thing with a neck a Thing that 
bellowed and writhed in pain." 

Is this style of composition any more " virile," is 
its imagery more pleasing or more vivid, than that 
revealed in the works of some of the great earlier 
writers who knew nothing of this "renascence " ? 
Opening one of the Waverley Novels at random, 
we hit upon the following bit of description : 

" The path soon led deeper into the woodland, and 
crossed more than one brook, the approach to which 
was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it 
flowed; but the stranger seemed to know, as if by 
instinct, the soundest ground and the safest points of 
passage, and by dint of caution and attention, brought 
the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had 
yet seen ; and pointing to a large low irregular building 
at the upper extremity, he said to the Prior, ' Yonder 
is Rotherwood, the dwelling of Cedric the Saxon '." 

Can we wish any alteration of even a word in this ? 
Is not the English of Addison as nearly perfect as 
we can conceive language to be, and the easy flow 
of Macaulay's prose as faultless as it could well be 
made ? Even pedantic old Johnson has plenty of 
the " virile " in his style, despite the scarcity of old 
English words, and there is grace and harmony 
and balance at the same time. Recall for a moment 
his well-known comparison of Pope and Dryden, 
and see whether it could in any way be altered for 
the better : 

"The style of Drydeu is capricious aud varied; that 
of Pope is cautious and uniform. Dryden obeys the 
motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to 
his own rules of composition. Dryden is sometimes 
vehement and rapid; Pope is always smooth, uniform 
and gentle. Dryden's page is a natural field, rising into 
inequalities, and diversified by the varied exuberance of 
abundant vegetation ; Pope's is a velvet lawn, shaven by 
the scythe and levelled by the roller." 

The poetry of the first part of the century, of the 
Lake poets, is contrasted with that of the genera- 
tion subsequent to William Morris and Swinburne, 
and the reader is told that 



" Compared with these men in their typical manner, 
the poetry of the great earlier men Wordsworth, 
Coleridge, Keats, and Shelley shows a startling differ- 
ence in regard to the relative prominence of native En- 
glish words and formations. They had not the advan- 
tage of the popularization of younger literature which 
has since transpired [sic]. And the latter-day bards, 
the generation subsequent to the Morris-Swinburne 
time, reveal this influence more and more, just in pro- 
portion as they are virile and awake to larger possibili- 
ties for melody aud harmony now open to English." 

Alas ! poor Wordsworth, poor Coleridge ! They 
had to write the " Lyrical Ballads " without ever 
having seen one of the " Barrack-Room Ballads." 
They had not the advantage of the popularization 
of younger literature. Probably the possibility of 
such lines as the following, quoted from Mr. Kip- 
ling by the author of " The Renascence in English," 
had never dawned upon them : 

" Oh, was I born of womankind, and did I play alone ? 
For I have dreamed of playmates twain that bit me to the 

bone. 

And did I break the barley bread and steep it in the tyre ? 
For I have dreamed of a youngling kid new riven from the 

byre, 
An hour it lacks and an hour it lacks to the rising of the 

moon ; 
But I can see the black roof-beams as plain as it were 

noon." 

Our unfortunate Wordsworth was forced to content 
himself with turning out such lines as the following, 
from 4i Tintern Abbey " : 

" The sounding cataract 
Haunted me like a passion ; the tall rock, 
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, 
Their colours and their forms, were then to me 
An appetite, a feeling and a love, 
That had no need of a remoter charm 
By thoughts supplied, nor any interest 
Unborrowed from the eye. 

A sense sublime 

Of something far more deeply interfused, 
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, 
And the round ocean and the living air 
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man, 
A motion and a spirit, that impels 
All thinking things, all objects of all thought, 
And rolls through all things." 

The following passage from Marsh's " Origin 
and History of the English Language " may be of 
interest as touching on the causes which led to the 
adoption of foreign words : 

" The birth or revival of a truly national and peculiar 
literature is generally contemporaneous with an enlarge- 
ment of the vocabulary, by foreign importation, or by 
the resuscitation of obsolete words of native growth. 
It is not always easy to say whether this extensiou of 
the means of expression is the cause or the consequence 
of the conception and familiarization of new ideas; but, 
in any event, new thoughts and new words are neces- 
sarily connected, if not twin-born. . . . The want of a 
sufficient nomenclature and the convenience of rhyme 
and metre, as is very clearly seen in all the older En- 
glish versions, naturally led to the employment of many 
French words."

In view of this " want of a sufficient nomencla- 
ture," what can it profit our language to cultivate 
a preference for old English terms whose inadequacy 
has been proved by centuries of experience ? What 
advantages of clearness or picturesqueness or even 
of strength did the historian Freeman hope to gain 
by carrying his preference for native English words 
so far as to repeat the same substantive or verb or 
adjective again and again in the same passage, 
rather than use a synonym of foreign growth ? 
The conditions of early English life were too 
cramped and primitive to admit of the formation 
of a vocabulary at all adequate to our needs. The 
necessity which our literature felt for a proper 
medium of expression worked out its own relief by 
laying hold of words wherever they came most 
readily to hand, whether from without or from 
within. It was so in Chaucer's time, and it will 
continue to be so as long as our language is spoken 
and written. PEECY F BlCKNELL .

THE COMPLETE WORKS OF POE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to call your attention to the fact that 
" The Journal of Julius Rodman," mentioned in your 
notice of the new edition of Poe's Works, was printed 
in Volume IV. of Ingram's edition of the Works of. 
Poe, published by Nimmo (Scribner & Welford, New 
York), in 1885. 

And, speaking of Poe, your readers may be interested 
to know that the manuscript of " The Bells," as finally 
sent by him to the printer, saving only the last four 
lines, is still in existence. It is in the form of his famous 
rolls, written on pale-blue paper, the fragments sheets 
and parts of sheets pasted together, end to end, and 
shows the printers' thumbing. It is the more interest- 
ing, from the erasures, interlineations, and alterations 
of the author. Inasmuch as certain peculiar italicising 
in the manuscript does not appear in any printed copy 
I have ever seen, it is evident that Poe continued to 
polish and refine the poem in the proofs. I am not 
sure that the poem gained by the omission of the italics 
in the line: 

" What & world of merriment its melody foretells." 
There is an unusualness in that italicised word quite 
characteristic of Poe. WILLIAM NELSON.

"THE DECADENCE OF A SCHOLAR." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with interest a cleverly written sally in 
your issue of October 1, entitled "The Decadence of a 
Scholar." While there is a leaven of wholesome truth 
in the sketch, it seems to me nevertheless to contain an 
implication (perhaps unintended) not at all palatable 
or flattering to a considerable class of your readers and 
contributors. If the usual method of securing and hold- 
ing professorships in American colleges be really such 
as Mr. Reeves intimates, then the plain inference is that 



our college professors are on the whole anything but 
the high-tninded and independent body of men we are 
accustomed to think them. For may we not infer from 
Mr. Reeves's pathetic picture of the " decadence " of 
the once proud-spirited " Thomson " (whose " scientific 
vigils " in Germany, by-the-bye, would seem to have 
made him more or less of a prig) that in our country 
professorships, formerly " plums, ready to fall into the 
hands of him who had most conscientiously prepared 
himself," are now the spoils of men who sink their re- 
spect for themselves and their calling by truckling to 
politicians, and making, not truth, but expediency and 
popularity, the rule of their teachings. Now I should 
be extremely sorry to think that even a small minority 
of the professors in our universities owe their positions 
to having " cultivated Wilcox," or hold them by the 
ignoble tenure of attuning their teachings to the cur- 
rent " political timbre." The fact is, there is no consid- 
erable class or corps in this country (except perhaps the 
clergy) so widely and proverbially remote from the in- 
fluence and sphere of action of political Wilcoxes as 
the one impliedly touched by Mr. Reeves; and the road 
to preferment taken by the hypothetical " Thomson " 
is, I venture to say, in the region of fact quite as un- 
usual as it is abject. Self-satisfied and inexperienced 
young men like Mr. " Thomson," who emerge from the 
universities with a blissful sense of their own compe- 
tency to lift up and enlighten an unregenerate world, 
are, it is true, usually obliged to dismount from their 
stilts and condescend to make some advances to people 
in a position to help them to the object of their wishes. 
But they need not, like Mr. " Thomson," sacrifice their 
self-respect and mental independence in doing so.

THE LOCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY 

OF CALIFORNIA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A paragraph has been going the rounds of the East- 
ern press, and found its way into the last issue of THE 
DIAL, to the effect that the Regents of the University 
of California have decided to remove the home of the 
University from Berkeley to San Francisco, and have 
accepted the offer of Mayor Sutro of thirteen acres of 
ground as a site for the new buildings. Permit me to 
say that this statement is incorrect. The University of 
California consists of the Colleges of General Culture, 
located in Berkeley; and the affiliated Colleges of Law, 
Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Art, which have 
always been located in Sail Francisco. The Colleges 
of General Culture have their home in half a dozen or 
more spacious buildings in Berkeley, the number of 
which is being constantly increased. The work of the 
affiliated colleges has heretofore been done in rented 
buildings. The last legislature appropriated $250,000 
for the erection of buildings that should belong to the 
state, in which the work of these affiliated colleges 
should be done. The thirteen acres offered by Mayor 
Sutro, and accepted by the Board of Regents, are offered 
as a site for these new buildings, and have nothing to 
do with the location of the University proper the Col- 
leges of General Culture. These remain in Berkeley. 
The Astronomical Observatory on Mount Hamilton is 
also a part of the property of the University, and under 
the control of the Regents. ^ j[ y RAYMOND.

FLAUBERT'S JJIFE AND LETTERS.* 

The volume containing the life and letters 
of Gustave Flaubert will come with a quicken- 
ing appeal to the average reader of French lit- 
erature, who may have pushed his way with 
deepening repugnance through " Madame Bo- 
vary," or been awe-stricken but fatal defect 
not interested by the piled-up erudition of 
" Salammbo." This average reader, repre- 
sentative of the great middle-class which Flau- 
bert detested so cordially, will probably rise 
from the perusal of Mr. Tarver's volume with 
the assurance that Flaubert's life is more in- 
teresting than his writings. 

It was a life lived through the sixty years 
(18211880) which were the heart of the cen- 
tury. The Bourbons, the Republic, the Second 
Empire, the Prussian invasion, the Commune, 
the new Republic, Flaubert saw them all, and 
their effects on France ; and his pictures from 
the comedie humaine are colored accordingly. 
Yet in itself, the current of his life ran smoothly 
enough. Possessed of a comfortable fortune, 
never marrying, a devoted son to his widowed 
mother in their peaceful Norman home near 
Rouen, it is obvious that Flaubert's fascination 
for us is one of personality, not of environment. 
Impetuous in his affections, sweeping in his 
judgments, boisterous even to horse-play in his 
humor, he was superlative in everything. This 
fluffy-haired giant could devote three hours to 
a practical joke on a friend, or six years to the 
production of a book. 

What extremes he was capable of may be 
illustrated by Mr. Tarver's account of an inci- 
dent in Flaubert's Wanderjahre, when he and 
his friend Maxime Ducamp were making a 
pedestrian tour through Brittany. 

" At a fair at Gue*rand the travelers came upon a man 
who was showing a monstrosity or a pair of monstros- 
ities for authorities differ on this point. According to 
Ducamp, the ' young phenomenon ' was a sheep with 
five legs and a stiff tail ; according to Flaubert there 
were two, a cow and a sheep, ' wearing one arm, four 
shoulders,' as the showman stated. Flaubert fell in 
love with the ' young phenomenon,' made much of the 
showman; would have him to dine, when he got abom- 
inably drunk; encouraged him to write to King Louis 
Philippe ; declared that he would make his fortune. 
For days the joke lasted. He could talk of nothing 
but the 'young phenomenon'; would stop in the mid- 
dle of the road and exhibit poor Ducamp, in the style 

* GUSTAVE FLAUBERT, AS SEEN IN HIS WORKS AND COR- 
RESPONDENCE. By John Charles Tarver. New York : D. 
Appleton & Co. 



of the showman, to the trees and hedges as ' the young 
phenomenon.' At Brest he encountered the 'young 
phenomenon ' again, who had united his, or their, forces 
with a dancing bear, some performing dogs, a donkey, 
and a pack of fighting mongrels. Again the hospitali- 
ties of Flaubert proved too much for the sobriety of the 
showman. A year later, Maxime Ducamp was lying ill 
at Paris, having been wounded in the tumults of '48 ; 
he was one day disturbed by hearing a strange confu- 
sion of sounds on his staircase, pushing, struggling, 
suppressed explosions. Suddenly the door flew open, 
and Flaubert appeared: 'Gentlemen, allow me to intro- 
duce to you the young phenomenon; it is three years 
old, has been approved by the Academy of Medicine, 
and been honored by the presence of several crowned 
heads.' Flaubert had discovered his old friend at a 
fair in some part of Paris, and spent a hundred francs 
for the pleasure of this private exhibition." 

Compare with this the following bit of ele- 
giac musing over Chateaubriand's tomb at St. 
Malo, visited by the two friends a few days 
after their meeting with the " young phenom- 
enon ": 

" There he will sleep, his head turned to the West, 
in the tomb built on a cliff, his immortality will be like 
his life, deserted of all and surrounded by storms. The 
waves with the centuries will long murmur round this 
great monument; they will spring to his feet in the 
tempests, or in the summer mornings, when the white 
sails are spread and the swallow comes from beyond the 
seas, long and gentle, they will bring him the voluptu- 
ous melancholy of distances, and the caress of the open 
air. And the days thus slipping by, while the billows of 
his native beach shall be forever swinging between his 
birthplace and his tomb, the heart of Rend, cold at last, 
will slowly crumble into nothingness to the endless 
rhythm of that eternal music." 

Which seems to justify his friend Bouilhet in 
calling him a lyric poet, though he could not 
write a verse. 

Flaubert thus characterizes himself as a 
hater of the commonplace, and a lover of the 
beautiful : 

" And now what I like above everything is form, pro- 
vided that it be beautiful, and nothing more. . . . For 
me there is nothing in the world except beautiful verses, 
well-turned, harmonious, resonant phrases, glorious sun- 
sets, moonlight, coloured paintings, antique marbles, and 
shapely heads. Beyond that, nothing. ... In all pol- 
itics there is only one thing that I understand, revolt. 
Fatalist as a Turk, I believe that all that we may do for 
the progress of humanity, or anything else, comes to 
absolutely the same thing. As for this ' progress,' my 
understanding is a bit obtuse for things that are not 
quite clear. All that has to do with that way of talk- 
ing fatigues me immeasurably." 

His genius ripened slowly into adequate ex- 
pression. At the age of twenty-eight, he had 
published nothing of importance, though the 
" Temptation of St. Anthony " had been com- 
pleted and read in MS. to his intimate friends 
Ducamp and Bouilhet. It is interesting to re- 
call the scene : 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



209 



" Early in the autumn (of 1849) Flaubert wrote to 
Ducamp, ' the Temptation is finished, come ! ' Dueamp 
started at once for Croisset; found Bouilhet already 
established there ; and the reading began. It lasted four 
days; eight hours a day; from mid-day till four in the 
afternoon; from eight in the evening till midnight. At 
the beginning, Flaubert, waving the pages above his 
head, cried: ' If you do not utter howls of enthusiasm, 
the reason is that nothing is capable of moving you.' 
For two-and-thirty hours the friends listened in silence; 
at the end of each reading Madame Flaubert (his 
mother) used to inquire ' Well ? ' and they had no reply 
to make. Before the last sitting Ducamp and Bouilhet 
conferred privately ; they determined to give their opin- 
ion frankly, without reserve ; the question of Flaubert's 
literary future was at stake. 

" That evening, after the last reading, towards mid- 
night, Flaubert, tapping on the table, said : ' Now, it is 
with the three of us, tell me frankly what you think.' 
Bouilhet replied : We think you ought to throw it into 
the fire and never speak of, it again.' A conversation 
followed, which lasted till eight o'clock in the morning ; 
Flaubert at last, conquered rather than convinced, gave 
way. ' St. Anthony ' was not burned but consigned to 
a drawer." 

" Madame Bo vary " is Flaubert's best- 
known if not his greatest work. It is as dis- 
tinctive of him as " Vanity Fair " of Thack- 
eray or " Jane Eyre " of Miss Bronte ; and is 
simply unequalled as a searching and pitiless 
satire on provincial French life, which won 
for its author a place among the first literary 
names in France. It is impossible to reproduce 
here Mr. Tarver's admirable summary of this 
Gallic " Middlemarch " ; nor is it desirable. 
The merits of the book are its penetration, its 
truth, its mastery of detail, not the sordid and 
repellant little lives and events transfixed for 
inspection, like an entomologist's beetles. As 
to its " realism " much misunderstanding has 
been rife ; it is sufficient to accept Flaubert's 
distinction (so often sharply insisted on by 
him) between the love of realism, and the love 
of the real : 

" They think me in love with the real, whereas I ex- 
ecrate it: it is out of hatred of it that I have under- 
taken this book. . . . Do you really believe that this 
mean reality, whose reproduction disgusts you, does 
not make my gorge rise as much as yours? If you 
knew me better, you would know that I hold the 
everyday life in detestation. Personally I have always 
kept myself as far away from it as I could. But 
aesthetically I wanted this time, and only this time, to 
exhaust it thoroughly." 

The success of " Madame Bovary " was too 
pronounced : its straightforward way of calling 
the French spade a spade was found by the 
Government to be an outrage on morals and 
religion, and the author was prosecuted. On 
January 23, 1857, Flaubert writes to his old 
friend Jules Cloquet : 



"I beg to inform you that to-morrow, the twenty- 
fourth of January, I honor the criminals' bench with 
my presence, sixth chamber of the executive police, at 
ten o'clock in the morning. Ladies are admitted; cos- 
tumes must be decent and in good style. 

" I do not count on any justice at all. I shall be 
condemned, and have to pay the highest possible fine 
perhaps; a pleasant reward for my toils, noble encour- 
agement given to literature. But one thing consoles 
me for these stupidities ; it is that I have found so much 
sympathy with myself and my book. I count yours in 
the first rank, my dear friend. Now I defy the whole 
French magistracy, with its policemen, and the whole 
Committee of Public Safety, including its spies, to write 
a novel which will please you as much as mine. These 
are the proud thoughts which I propose to cherish in 
my dungeon." 

The trial resulted in a sort of ambiguous ver- 
dict of " Not guilty, but don't do it again " ; 
and the book was triumphantly advertised and 
widely sold. 

If Flaubert had kept to modern life in his 
next novel, we should have had a literary suc- 
cess instead of an antiquarian tour de force. 
But " Salammbo " called out certain qualities 
lavishly present in Gustave Flaubert's make- 
up enormous industry, a relish of details, and 
a Victor Hugo-ish fondness for extravagant 
lists of recondite names and these fairly 
smother the story. Still, Flaubert had felt 
that the book must be written, and fairly 
wreaked himself on it : we can only echo the 
wonder of Henry James that " a writer could 
spend such an infinity of talent in making 
himself unreadable." 

In the dark days of 1870, Flaubert was 
writing his " Education Sentimentale," and 
incidentally girding at the fatuity of the " mid- 
dle class people." The municipal council of 
Rouen had refused to allow space in the public 
square for a memorial to Louis Bouilhet, Flau- 
bert's poet-friend. This refusal drew from 
the novelist a slashing open letter, which con- 
cluded with the following vigorous indictment : 

"There are seven hundred of you in the National 
Assembly. How many of those are there who can tell 
the names of the principal treaties in our history, or 
the dates of six kings of France who know the first 
elements of political economy who have read even 
Bastiat ? The municipality of Rouen, which has denied 
as a body the merit of a poet, is possibly ignorant of 
the rules of versification. And it has no need to know 
them, so long as it does not meddle with verses. 

"To be respected by what is below you, please to 
respect what is above you. 

" Before sending the people to school, go there your- 
selves! 

" Enlightened classes, seek enlightenment. . . . Your 
whole intellectual effort consists in trembling before the 
future. Bethink yourselves of something else. Rouse 
yourselves, or France will soon sink deeper and deeper

into the gulf, between a hideous demagogy and a mind- 
less middle-class." 

To which Mr. Tarver adds, not without mal- 
ice : " Can this be that same French middle- 
class that Mr. Matthew Arnold was wont to 
hold up to Englishmen as a brilliant example? " 

We must close this desultory notice with a 
few general remarks on this interesting pre- 
sentment of one of the most original and bril- 
liant of Frenchmen. Mr. Tarver's aim, as 
announced in his preface, is to place the per- 
sonality of Gustave Flaubert vividly before 
his readers. The book is essentially made up 
from the correspondence of Flaubert ; the edi- 
tor, with rare self-restraint, supplying only so 
much running comment and outline biography 
as will serve to make the letters intelligible 
and attractive. His work has been well done ; 
the apparently scrappy appearance of some of 
his interposed remarks is a necessary incident 
of his method. His comments on Flaubert's 
character and conduct, as well as his criticisms 
on the novels (full summaries of which are 
given), seem, on the whole, eminently shrewd 
and just. His style is trenchant, almost epi- 
grammatic ; albeit disfigured for American 
eyes by the Briticism " by way of " (e. g., 
" Mile. Leroyer de Chantepie was by way of 
being an authoress," p. 228). 

The volume is handsomely printed and bound, 
contains two illustrations and a good index, 
and does credit to the publishers. Altogether, 
we may thank Mr. Tarver for a distinct addi- 
tion to the literary biography of the century.

ZEBULON MONTGOMERY PIKE.* 



Dr. Coues's new edition of the " Pike Ex- 
peditions " is a beautiful specimen of press- 
work most creditable to the taste and liberal- 
ity of the publisher. No explorer could ask a 
more enviable destiny than to be enshrined in 
such pages. The edition is limited to eleven 
hundred and fifty copies, of which the first one 
hundred and fifty are printed on hand-made 
paper, and one thousand on fine book paper. No 
expense has been spared in materials and typo- 
graphical work, and the result is delight to the 
eye and to the mind. The editor has done the 
material portion of his work as successfully as 

THE EXPEDITIONS OF ZEBULON MONTGOMERY PUCE. A

has the publisher. A comparison of these three 
stately volumes with the plebeian single volume 
of the original edition of 1810 emphasizes the 
progress of book-making in the century. Dr. 
Coues has appreciated the real function of ed- 
itorship in regard to such a work, and has cor- 
rected the misprints, solecisms, and faulty 
punctuation of the original. He has also re- 
constructed the arrangement. Pike's hurriedly- 
made edition is composed of three parts (cor- 
responding to three stages of his travels) fol- 
lowed by three appendices in smaller type. As 
each of the parts is little more than a bare 
iter, and as the three appendices pertain re- 
spectively to these parts, adding to them much 
elaborative material of the nature of letters and 
reports, Dr. Coues has placed each of them 
after its appropriate part, in uniform type, 
after arranging its documents in chronological 
order. The result is a well digested and most 
readable chronicle, instead of ill assorted bun- 
dles of information. To all the plates and 
maps of the first edition have been added an 
" historico-geographical " chart of the upper 
Mississippi, made under the direction of the 
editor, and a facsimile letter from Pike ac- 
knowledging to the Secretary of War his ap- 
pointment as major. The handwriting of this 
letter is admirable in its regularity. One 
looks for such a script from a clerk, but not 
from a soldier ; yet it is full of the forceful 
character of Pike. 

The editor passes from the lower to the 
higher elements of his work in an exhaustive 
name-index of one hundred pages, composing 
the third volume. The versatile editor must 
have been in one of his merriest moods when, 
in composing his preface, he characterized this 
index as " exceptionally accurate," if accuracy 
includes arrangement as well as content and 
reference. In the two latter points, so far as ex- 
amination goes, it deserves the commendation ; 
but in the matter of arrangement it is cer- 
tainly most helpful when read straight through. 
"Pike, Capt. John" precedes "Pike City, 
Cal."; "Pike, Major Z." precedes "Pike, 
memoir of "; " Pike, Mrs. Z. M." precedes 
"Pike, N. Y."; and the nearly two columns 
regarding the word pike and its derivatives be- 
gins : " pike, a fish," " Pikean source of Miss. 
R.," "pike, a weapon," "Pike bay." Yet, 
withal, this index is a most needful companion 
in searching among the riches accumulated in 
Dr. Coues's notes. An important portion of 
the first volume is a biographical sketch of 
Pike, by Dr. Coues, in which he says he has

used much hitherto unpublished documentary 
material, and other sources of information not 
before utilized ; and it is especially full in re- 
gard to the later years of Pike's life. But it 
is sketchy and imperfect for the earlier life. 
On page 603, Pike speaks of himself as " hav- 
ing commanded for some time the post of Kas- 
kaskias." There is no mention of this fact in 
the biography. In fact, one cannot there learn 
where he spent the first ten years of his mili- 
tary career with the exception of the years 
1800-1801. 

Nearly one-half of the text of these volumes 
is made up of critical and illustrative notes by 
the editor. Here is a great wealth of material 
geographical, topographical, ethnological, 
biographical, and linguistic, and here Dr. 
Coues is a master. It is well known that 
Pike's narrative covers two expeditions : one, 
by authority of the President, from St. Louis 
to the headwaters of the Mississippi, in 1805-6 ; 
the other, under orders from General Wilkin- 
son, the commander-in-chief, through Louis- 
iana Territory to Mexico, in 1806-1807. The 
first of these expeditions, as well as the con- 
temporaneous Lewis and Clark expedition, was 
part of a general plan of President Jefferson, 
to take stock of his new purchase of half 
a continent ; and the second, although not or- 
dered by the President, was approved by him 
and had in the main the same object. The 
newly extended boundaries were to be brought 
out of the realm of conjecture into that of fact, 
and the Indian tribes were to be attached more 
closely to the national government. On the 
northern adventure, the British traders of the 
Northwest Fur Company, who had entered into 
trade relations with our Indians and encroached 
somewhat upon our political prerogatives, were 
to be met; in the Southwest, the Spaniards 
who were intriguing from Santa Fe were to be 
checkmated. Pike performed both missions 
with much intrepidity and tact, although the 
personal outcome of the first was more fortunate 
than of the second. In both cases, launching 
forth with a handful of soldiers into a practic- 
ally unknown wilderness, he endured physical 
ills as great as fall to the lot of most Arctic 
explorers. From the first journey he returned 
with laurels after eight months ; from the sec- 
ond he was sent back as a prisoner at the hands 
of the governor of New Spain. Dr. Coues, in 
the summer of 1894, in person retraced the 
entire boat- journey of Pike to the head waters 
of the Mississippi, himself discovering the real 
sources ; and his voluminous notes cover nearly 



every acre of the route with the minutest de- 
tails of topography and previous visitations. 
Every collateral knowledge that in any wise 
may illustrate the main text is brought in ; and 
one leaves each stage for the next, feeling that 
nothing more could have been said. The jour- 
ney to the Rio Grande is handled in the same 
exhaustive way. The editor's twenty years of 
army life on our western frontier enabled him 
at different times to visit nearly every portion 
of Pike's route, and he has accumulated here 
also the same wealth of illustrative material. 
Not only has he shown a German industry in 
his commentary on his text, but he has shown 
the brilliancy of a Frenchman in his presenta- 
tion. His pathway sparkles with wit, and one 
follows him with unabated interest, and even 
ardor, to the end. Even the dreary wastes of 
an index are enlivened with such an explana- 
tory note as : " The arrangement of the entries 
is intended to be strictly alphabetical, without 
regard to the logical order in which phrase- 
names and phrases would follow one another : 
thus . . . various Sandy things interrupt 
the canon of Spanish saints whose names be- 
gin with San." One admirable note gives a 
complete history of the surveys in connection 
with the Gadsden Purchase boundary. Va- 
rious other notes are devoted to the linguistic 
and ethnic relations of our Indian tribes. No 
explorer has ever been more fully aided to ex- 
press himself through the ampler knowledges 
of the generations that come after him than in 
this case. 

It would be pleasant to end our review at 
this point. No allusion has yet been made to 
the spirit in which this critical work has been 
done ; and herein lies the deficiency of the edi- 
tor. Major Pike's explorations bring one not 
merely into the fields of geography and ethnol- 
ogy, but are a part of the history of the United 
States. A critic who handles an historical 
theme, and deals with men and measures, should 
have the historical perception, as well as the 
ability to observe and relate natural phenomena. 
Yet there is no antinomy here. It is the true 
scientific vision that is needed in both cases 
the ability to see things in their relations. Dr. 
Coues has established an international reputa- 
tion as a natural-science worker. Yet when he 
steps within the field of social phenomena, his 
manner is thoroughly unscientific. He does 
not seem to know that the idea of evolution, 
undoubtedly accepted by him in his own field 
of work, is also a fully accepted working prin- 
ciple in the social and historical field. His

special inability seems to be in the direction 
of an historic religion, and he is apparently 
unable to judge the religious perceptions of the 
sixteenth century A.D., or of the sixteenth cen- 
tury B.C., by any other standard than that of 
the latter part of the nineteenth century. Pike's 
incidental remark that he is reading Volney's 
" Ruins " is the occasion for half a page, in 
fine print, of atrabilious comment on the 
" they " who called Volney an infidel. Pike's 
reference to " a Reynard " who professed not 
to believe in a hereafter brings out a page of 
abuse of the Hebrews, who " invented very 
little except their precious Jehovah, who was 
less polished and less agreeable a god than 
most of those who were elaborated by the more 
civilized tribes who surrounded and generally 
whipped the Jews." The "Noachian narra- 
tion " comes in for withering scorn, since " the 
most credible items in this account are that the 
elephant took his trunk with him and stood 
behind it in the ark, but that the cock and the 
fox were worse off for baggage, having only a 
comb and a brush between them." There is 
a fling at " the unisexual transports of the mor- 
bid imagination " of the noble Marquette whom 
the world will still continue to admire with the 
authority of Mr. Parkman. In truth, in an- 
other note the whole effort of the Roman 
Catholic Church in behalf of the American 
Indian in New Spain, from 1537 to the present 
time, is brutually characterized as the work of 
" the horde of corrupt, profligate and extortion- 
ate ecclesiastics who have cursed the country 
from that day to this." Poor Mr. Schoolcraft 
is treated to two pages of belaboring, as " a 
gentleman who was expert in expanding his 
own stock of information to the most volumin- 
ous proportions, and whose cacoethes scribendi, 
by dint of incessant scratching, finally devel- 
oped a case of pruritus senilis, marked by an 
acute mania for renaming things he had named 
years before," and who was true " to the su- 
preme selfishness, inordinate vanity, vehement 
prejudices and conscientious narrow-minded- 
ness with which his all-wise and all-powerful 
Calvinistic creator had been graciously pleased 
to endow him." 

Dr. Coues reminds one of Carlyle. He is fre- 
quently as brilliant, he is fully as prejudiced, 
and he is even more hopelessly dyspeptic. If 
he were content to gird only at those minds 
which to-day still trammel themselves with the 
limitations of Jahvism or of Calvinism, instead 
of accepting all the truth of God which our 
own favored age makes its own, we would pass 



him by silently. But as a visitor in the domain 
of history, he fails to grasp even a faint portion 
of Tennyson's wise words : 

" Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs. 
And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of 
the suns." 

For he sins not only against the men who are 
the bystanders in his critical career through 
the ages : he sins against the hero of his tale 
as well. There is not a word, either in the 
text or in the critical notes, that bears any 
evidence to a fair mind of Pike's knowledge of 
any nefarious scheme against Mexico on the 
part of his commanding officer. Yet the edi- 
tor assumes as fact what has never been proved 
although strongly suspected even of Wil- 
kinson ; and then carries over, by a sort of im- 
putation, the evil designs to the credit of Pike. 
There is again and again a disparagement of 
Pike by sinister interpretation, which is not 
justified by anything we know of him. In 
short, Dr. Coues has laid down an admirable 
rule by which his critical estimates of men 
should have been and have not been guided, 
when he says, with the true scientific temper, 
in answer to aspersions upon Beltrami's char- 
acter : " With me the question is not one of 
Beltrami's character, temperament, imagina- 
tion, sex-relations, etc., but simply, What did 
he do about the Mississippi origines ? " 

This work is one that we must ever prize 
highly as a treasury of multifarious knowledge, 
whilst we at the same time regret the limita- 
tions of the gifted editor. For a tolerant spirit, 
a disposition to entertain evidence for as well 
as against, and ability to discern the true grain 
amid the chaff and to recognize the achieve- 
ment of those who in earlier times without 
straw made the brick upon which we found, 
are essential qualifications of one who would 
really enter the field of historical criticism.

" THE BISMARCK or BULGARIA." * 

The recent assassination of Stambuloff, " the 
Bismarck of Bulgaria," has stimulated public 
curiosity regarding his life and work, and the 
readable biography by Mr. A. Hulme Beaman 
will supply all that most readers will care for. 
The author was an intimate friend of the states- 
man and patriot whose life he has written, and 
is an Englishman. It follows that he is an

enthusiastic admirer of Stambuloff's splendid 
fight against Russian influence, and of his con- 
structive work in building up a Bulgarian 
nation. The book is written with the sym- 
pathy necessary to a good biography, but the 
author's admiration has not blinded him to 
the defects of his subject. The book is, from 
the English standpoint, and we believe from the 
world's standpoint, a thoroughly good sketch 
of the political career of Stambuloff, and of 
the rise of independent Bulgaria. 

The life of Stambuloff was a stirring and a 
stormy one. Revolutionist at fourteen, Nihil- 
ist at eighteen and expelled from Russia, at 
twenty-one he was the life and centre of the 
revolutionary movement in Bulgaria against 
the oppression of the Turk. His whole time 
was spent in the work of organizing committees 
and planning futile risings, " marked from the 
first by his imperious spirit and indomitable 
energy, as the natural champion of Bulgarian 
independence." 

The Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 gave 
Bulgaria practical independence from Turkey, 
but she was sadly lacking in men with the 
requisite knowledge and training to manage 
her affairs. But this lack of experience in po- 
litical life only intensified political passion, and 
degraded party contests into personal and fac- 
tional strife. Two parties contested bitterly 
for supremacy, the National and the Russo- 
phile. In this contest, Stambuloff soon emerged 
as the National leader, as ardent an opponent 
of Russia, the new foe of Bulgarian indepen- 
dence, as he had been of Turkey in former days. 
From this time the history of Bulgaria cen- 
tres in him until his fall in 1894. The Czar 
seemed to have the little state in his power, 
when he had punished Prince Alexander by 
forcing his abdication ; but he had not taken 
sufficient account of this young man, then only 
thirty-two years old. He was Regent during 
those critical and exciting days, and during the 
interregnum until Ferdinand was hunted up, 
elected, and invested with power. The course 
of Russia toward Bulgaria, her dog-in-the-man- 
ger policy, can never be anything but a dis- 
credit to the late Czar. The plots formed and 
attempts made to destroy the national govern- 
ment and crush the rising national spirit were 
unworthy of a civilized ruler. The thwarting 
of these, in addition to the government of the 
turbulent country, was a heavy task, and the 
splendid success attained will be Stambuloff's 
permanent monument in history. 

Yet there is another side, and Mr. Beaman 



does not attempt to hide it. Stambuloff was 
arbitrary, unwilling to yield in any point, but 
bound to override all opposition. No prince 
could long endure the masterful rule of such 
a premier, nor could associates who were un- 
willing to be mere clerks serve under him long. 
He was a patriot to the last drop of his blood, 
and had the insight of a real statesman. He 
would not yield, because he knew his policy to 
be the best for his country. Yet his rough 
disregard and insolent treatment of his col- 
leagues and his prince made enemies that fin- 
ally overthrew him, and wrecked, for a time 
at least, the policy his heart was set on. The 
persecution visited upon him when once his 
position had been undermined, and the subse- 
quent horrible assassination directly instigated 
by Prince Ferdinand, show this prince to be 
one of the meanest men that ever filled a 
throne. Nor can Russia be freed from the 
stain of complicity in ^these base deeds. 

Though Stambuloff was harsh in his treat- 
ment of opponents and arbitrary in his man- 
agement of the government, he must be judged, 
not by Western standards, but by his surround- 
ings as the head of a youthful nation just 
emerging from the despotism of the Turk into 
self-government and constitutional methods of 
political life. So judged, much that we con- 
demn in his course will disappear, while his 
achievements will deserve higher praise from 
the disadvantages under which he worked.

INSPIRATION AND INTERPRETATION.* 

Most of the works now before us pertain to the 
evidences of Christian faith, or to its right inter- 
pretation. The two are, in fact, closely united. If 
we interpret our oracles of belief in one way, the 
proof of their authenticity is comparatively easy

and simple ; if we render them in another and more 
authoritative form, as we deem it the proof be- 
comes much more complicated and difficult. The 
key to our exegesis and our evidences is one and 
the same : our notion of inspiration. If the inspira- 
tion we accept and enforce is one of authority in 
any degree beyond that which attaches to the Scrip- 
tural declarations themselves, then this authority, 
both as to its validity and its extent, puts us con- 
stantly in a defensive attitude, and becomes a very 
exacting element in our exegetical and in our his- 
torical rendering of religious truth. If, on the other 
hand, the Scriptures hold their moral proof and 
power within themselves, we at once attain freedom 
in our reconstruction of the events under which 
they have arisen. The mind and heart are simply 
dealing with their own in all Scriptural inquiry. 

The prevalent notion of inspiration has arisen 
chiefly in behalf of authority ; and yet the corrected 
view gives a far more stable and undeniable hold 
of the truth on the mind. We can neither palter 
with nor escape that which declares itself as light 
within our own spiritual consciousness. Between 
two spiritual summits, men'have mistaken the lower 
one for the higher one. As their better measure- 
ments correct their error, they begin silently to for- 
sake the one and seek the other. That mind is in- 
spired which is acting with God, the medium of 
communication being simply the truth. We cannot 
leave the question of inspiration with a vague an- 
swer, and then pass on to interpretation. We must 
know at the beginning of our exegesis what author- 
ity to attach to it. 

" The Breath of God " is a prolonged rhetorical 
rhapsody. This is a remark of description, not of 
censure. Those who wish an effusive and impres- 
sional statement of the Bible and its services will 
find it in this volume. The fact is sufficiently in- 
dicated by a portion of the titles of successive chap- 
ters : " King Liber," " His Courtiers," " His Critics," 
" His Blemishes," " His Exaltation," " His Power." 

" Christian Evidences " is a very concise presen- 
tation of the proofs of Christianity, and one at the 
same time comprehensive and discriminating. It 
rests upon lectures given by Dr. Robinson as an 
instructor, and is rather a comprehensive statement 
of their substance than the full text. The stand- 
point of the author is that of liberal orthodoxy, and 
the weight of emphasis is laid on the completeness 
of Christian truth and its power to assert itself ; its 
power to master, guide, and build up the human 
spirit. The perennial vitality of Christian faith is 
the force of the volume. 

" Religious Doubt " is a kindly and painstaking 
book, and, from the author's point of view, compre- 
hensive. Yet it is fitted to interest only a limited 
number who share the religious prepossessions on 
which it rests. There are two kinds of doubt : one 
arising from the strong independent action of the 
mind, and another due to its hesitancy and weak- 
ness. One is incident to growth, the other follows 



on the decay or perversion or misdirection of powers. 
It is the second of these that the author treats so 
fully. Doubt is with him much of the nature of 
disease ; and though he is tender and patient in its 
treatment, he does not see that we have no other 
designation than that of doubt for a most robust and 
profitable frame of mind. The philosophy of the 
author prepares the way for this restricted view. 
Faith is, with him, a special power transcending 
reason, and making its own revelations. Not to 
have this power, therefore, in full and fortunate ac- 
tion, is simply and necessarily an evil. The higher 
truths of religion are its proper objects, and the ac- 
ceptance of these truths is evidence of a vigorous 
fulfilment of its functions. To those who regard 
faith as one form or direction in which our intel- 
lectual powers find expression, and who think that 
this expression is sure to be inadequate and may 
be false, the whole question of doubt assumes wider 
scope and demands different treatment. 

We make haste to affirm the ability and insight 
of the author of " Doctrine and Life." It is a 
book sure to receive and reward the diligent perusal 
of a large class of readers. We wish to secure, by 
this concession, a brief space for criticism. The 
title of the book, " Doctrine and Life," the preface, 
and the first chapter prepared us to expect, in the 
discussion that was to follow, a close connection be- 
tween Christian doctrine and Christian life. The 
author disappointed us in this respect. We turned 
eagerly to such chapters as those on " The Trinity," 
" The Person of Christ," " The Atonement," to see 
in what way these current dogmas now involved 
any refreshment to feeling and action. We found 
little in them beyond a softened and persuasive rep- 
resentation of the doctrines themselves. What we 
doubt is the present ministration of these dogmas 
to an enlarged spiritual life. This doubt the author 
leaves much as he finds it. He is disposed to waive 
any statement of the doctrine of inspiration, as a 
dogma that does not admit of any final determina- 
tion. In this he overlooks the fact that we cannot 
so much as enter on interpretation till we know 
what is to be conceded to simple authority. The 
author thinks that Christian doctrine may be " above 
and beyond reason." Now, if we mean by reason 
as we well may the entire hold of the mind on 
truth, then a dogma which transcends reason cannot 
be nutritious in spiritual life. It is, in that very 
degree, unmanageable intellectually indigestible. 

" Outlines of Social Theology " is a work, in the 
purpose indicated, not unlike " Doctrine and Life." 
" This little book aims to point out the logical re- 
lations in which the doctrines of theology will stand 
to each other when the time shall come again for 
seeing Christian truth in the light of reason, and 
Christian life as the embodiment of love " (Preface, 
page v.). The difference between them lies in the 
fact that President Hyde has thrown his full strength 
into the social force of religious truth, and so has 
wrought out a stirring exposition of the existing re-

lation of duty and belief. From our own point of 
view, we can but give the book a most cordial com- 
mendation. Our slight criticism would be that the 
author is anxious, too anxious, to impart the current 
cast of thought to the doctrine involved in his own 
presentation. The book is divided into three part: 
Theological, Anthropological, Sociological. Each 
of these again falls into three portions. The first, 
or theological part, involves the doctrine of the 
Trinity in a somewhat fanciful way. Professor Ste- 
vens hardly reaches the urgent social life that is 
upon us. President Hyde is unwilling to seem to 
leave behind him the. doctrinal life which has so 
stirred and ruled the world hitherto. Is not the 
real relation evolutionary ? Our acceptance of purer 
spiritual truth is not a desertion of dogma. It is 
allowing dogma to burst its integuments, and grow. 
We have no need to trouble ourselves about any 
identity in substance or in form between the seed 
and the plant which springs from it. The true de- 
pendence is that of genetic transition. The book is 
one of enthusiasms quite as much as of thoughts ; 
the author uses words freely, and gives the words 
he uses a wide range. Many practical questions 
as the unity of the church are treated very incis- 
ively. The entire temper of the volume is fitted to 
strengthen the mind and bear it forward. 

The three remaining volumes on our list are pri- 
marily exegetical. The first of the three, " The 
Messiah of the Apostles," is present in completion 
of two previous works by Professor Briggs, and 
gives the promise of two more volumes. The work 
of Professor Briggs is so thorough and candid as to 
command at once respect and attention. The va- 
riety in the views entertained by the authors of 
the New Testament of the nature and office of 
Christ and of his character as the Messiah is fully 
brought out. The work also contains an interesting 
discussion of the Apocalypse of John. The author 
accepts the theory that this is made up of different 
original documents, put together in the present form 
by a series of editors. It is resolved into six parts : 
the Apocalypse of the Beasts, of the Dragon, of the 
Trumpets, of the Seals, of the Bowls, of the Epis- 
tles. 

" St. John's Gospel" presents a large amount of 
matter in a clear, compact form, and in a discrim- 
inating way. The book is scholarly and earnest. 
It accepts the prevalent opinion as to the origin of 
the Gospel. The first hundred and seventy-nine 
pages are occupied with a discussion of the authen- 
ticity and character of the Gospel. In these pages, 
the author reviews the objections to its authenticity 
and the proofs in its favor, and discusses at large 
the Gospel itself. The last seventy pages give the 
Greek text with a literal interlinear translation. The 
text of the authorized version is given in the mar- 
gin, and the various readings at the bottom of the 
page. The volume puts the reader in possession of 
a large amount of material. 

In "The International Critical Commentary," 



Deuteronomy is the first of a series, whose an- 
nouncements already extend to twenty -eight vol- 
umes. The entire series will stand for an amount 
of labor and inquiry that is startling. The material 
is so abundant and varied in this first volume as to 
make the book one for protracted study, for refer- 
ence and consultation, rather than one for perusal. 
The minister must be well endowed who can make 
use of a fraction of what is here provided. The 
spirit is of the most catholic and liberal order, and 
aims to give all opinions due weight. Besides the 
Commentary of four hundred and twenty-seven 
pages, the volume contains an introductory discus- 
sion of Deuteronomy of ninety-five pages, treating 
in a very full manner its authorship, date, charac- 
ter. The purchaser of this volume is only too likely 
to be buried beneath the wealth of his reward. It 
was well that the Commentary on Deuteronomy 
should have been the first of the series to be issued, 
as it holds, perhaps more than any other book in 
the Old Testament, the key of interpretation, and 
determines later conclusions. The peerless manner 
in which Professor Driver has executed his work 
inspires some fear for those who are to follow him.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



So long as Mr. Richard Harding 
Davis continues to produce such 
fresh and spirited work as his 
" About Paris" (Harper), his vogue will stand in 
little danger of abatement. Mr. Davis is a wide- 
awake traveller, with a keen eye for the salient 
and the bizarre. He does not affect to resolve 
French humanity into its last elements, or to cut 
very deep into social metaphysics ; but he sets the 
outward and visible signs of things before us with 
much distinctness. Mr. Davis is a comparatively 
young man, with a young man's taste for novelty, 
and capacity of enjoyment. Even the worn attrac- 
tions of the cafes chantants, and the terpsichorean 
revels of the Mabille and the Moulin Rouge, do not 
appear to strike him as yet with a sense of hollow- 
ness; and the zest with which his scientific researches 
among still more risques haunts of pleasure-loving 
Paris have been pursued is happily reflected in his 
style. Mr. Davis has a due sense of personal and 
national humors and oddities witness his English 
tourists dressed (for the boulevards) " in flannel 
shirts and hunting-caps and knickerbockers, exactly 
as if they were penetrating the mountains of Af- 
ghanistan or the deserts of Syria " ; the young man 
who objected to Casimir-Perier as a presidential 
candidate because he was rich, but who " withdrew 
his objection when an older man in a blouse pointed 
out that Casimir-Perier would make an excellent 
appearance on horseback " ; the Deputy (a belated 
Montagnard, evidently) who refused to announce 
his vote, on the roll-call, " until he was addressed

as ' citizen ', and not as ' monsieur ' " ; the budding 
connoisseur (supported at Paris by a fond aunt in 
Kansas City) who superbly damns a picture " by 
waving his thumb in the air at it, and saying, ' it 
has a little too much of that,' with a downward 
sweep of the thumb, ' and not enough of this,' with 
an upward sweep." A capital story is that of 
Pierre Loti's admission to the Academy. The 
newly-elected Immortal, it seems, in his maiden 
address, " instead of eulogizing the man whose 
place he had taken, lauded his own methods and 
style of composition so greatly that when the second 
member arose he prefaced his remarks by suggest- 
ing that ' M. Loti has said so much for himself that 
he has left me nothing to add.' " The contents of 
the volume are divided into five chapters : " The 
Streets of Paris " ; " The Show Places of Paris " ; 
" Paris in Mourning " ; " The Grand Prix and 
Other Prizes " ; " Americans in Paris." The book 
is prettily bound, and passably illustrated by Mr. 
C. D. Gibson. 

The Women of " Margaret Winthrop," a biograph- 
Coioniai and Revo- ical sketch of the estimable wife of 



Governor John Winthrop of Mass- 
achusetts, is the initial volume of a promising series 
of portraits of distinguished " Women of Colonial 
and Revolutionary Times," now issuing from the 
press of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The 
book is from the accomplished pen of Mrs. Alice 
Morse Earle, who, we need not say, sets for the 
authors of the forthcoming volumes a desirable 
standard of form and quality. The object of the 
series is twofold : biographical and historical. Each 
volume, besides portraying the individual from 
whom it takes its title, is designed to serve as a 
study of the social life and customs of a special 
class, period, and geographical section. In Mrs. 
Earle's work, for instance, we are shown, in the 
first half of the volume, the domestic manners of 
Puritan England under James I. (Mrs. Winthrop 
not following her husband over seas until some 
years after his arrival in the Colony), as exhibited 
in the home life of a country housewife and lady of 
the manor ; and, in the second half, the correspond- 
ing phase of life in early colonial Massachusetts. 
Succeeding volumes will do for the Knickerbocker 
and the Cavalier sections of the country what the 
opening one does for the early Puritan. Mrs. 
Earle has done her work in her usual thorough way, 
sparing no pains in the way of research among the 
authorities, and freely interlarding her narrative 
with extracts from unfamiliar and out-of-the-way 
sources letters, journals, inventories, family ex- 
pense accounts, and what not. Outwardly, the 
volume (a shapely, well-printed duodecimo, prettily 
bound in crimson linen with plain gold lettering) 
is a model of taste ; and altogether the publishers 
are to be congratulated on the conception, and (thus 
far) the execution, of their venture. Each volume 
will contain either a frontispiece portrait, or, where 
no portrait is procurable, a facsimile reproduction. 



That Mrs. Earle has written con amore, and with 
unflagging interest in a theme which has long been 
her special literary province, is pleasantly manifest 
throughout the book, which, to our thinking, is in 
some respects the best she has given us. 

Mr. Charles Godfrey Leland's little 
volume of " Legends of Florence " 
(Macmillan), a collection of tales 
quaint, humorous, or gruesome, popularly associated 
with famous Florentine places and buildings, the 
Cathedral and Campanile, the Signoria, the Bar- 
gello, the old city gates, towers, bridges, crosses, etc., 
should prove no less interesting to the folk-lorist 
than entertaining to the general reader. Mr. Le- 
land's book differs from the familiar works of such 
writers as Mr. Hare, Mr. Scaife, and the sisters 
Horner, in that its contents are derived, not from 
authentic records, but from the people themselves 
the sole exceptions being certain racy anecdotes 
taken from antique jest-books, and the like bygone 
halfpenny literature of the people. The author or- 
iginally intended to include in the present work 
only the occulter sort of folk-lore of which his 
" Etruscan-Roman Remains in Popular Tradition " 
consists ; but finding himself, in the course of his 
labors, in danger of swamping amid an embarass- 
ment of riches in the way of the lighter, semi hu- 
morous local legends dear to the Florentine heart, 
he concluded to omit the graver matter, fol- 
lowing, we suppose, the rule of the illustrious Poggio 
that in a storm the heaviest things must go over- 
board first. Touching the more scientific aspect of 
his book, Mr. Leland forestalls the possible stric- 
tures of those whom he ironically styles " the second- 
rate folk-lorists, whose forte consists not in finding 
facts but faults," by cheerfully admitting that he 
has built up, on a plan suggested by the idea expede 
fferculem, certain tales from a very slight tradi- 
tional foundation. These instances, however, are 
the exceptions ; and we can answer for it that while 
Mr. Leland has occasionally sacrificed sans merci 
the letter, he has throughout admirably preserved 
the spirit of truth. Italian tourists will find the 
volume a delightful and inspiring companion in their 
rambles about Florence. 

Mr. Edward Robins's " Echoes of 
the Playhouse " ( Putnam) is an in- 
telligently written volume of remin- 
iscences of the older English stage, in which the 
reader may find concisely drawn and appreciated 
the careers and talents of such bygone Thespians 
as Garrick, Quin, Macklin, Foote, the Spranger 
Barrys, Mrs. Woffington, Kitty Clive, Mrs. Abing- 
ton, Nell Gwynne, Mrs. Bracegirdle, and other 
lesser lights, all of whom made their final exits long 
before the historic dignities of the drama gave way 
before the onset of the coming tide of fin de sibcle 
realism which now, carried to puerile excess, is rap- 
idly reducing the popular taste to an incapacity to 
enjoy anything above the intellectual level of

'" Punch." Contrasting the dramas regularly ex-

that the advantage is not altogether with our own 
times. In his opening chapter Mr. Robins discusses 
broadly, by way of prologue, the development of 
the British drama, from its sacerdotal original down 
to the day when its prosperity was temporarily dark- 
ened under the lowering sky of the Commonwealth. 
The text is enlivened throughout with odds and 
ends of green-room gossip and anecdote ; and the au- 
thor has fished up from the recprds much that even 
those familiar with stage literature will find com- 
paratively fresh. Discussing Garrick, Mr. Robins 
is inclined to think (with excellent reason) that his 
Hamlet was a wide departure from accepted models 
something in the way, probably, of M. Monnet- 
Sully's romantic and picturesque, if very un-English 
impersonation. The strain of French blood in Gar- 
rick may partly account for the strain of French 
vivacity in his acting. How he appeared, at first 
blush, to his startled contemporaries may be gath- 
ered from Mr. Richard Cumberland's graphic pen- 
picture : " Heavens, what a transition ! It seemed 
as if a whole century had been stepped over in a 
single scene old things were done away with, and 
a new order at once brought forward, light and lum- 
inous, and clearly destined to dispel the barbarisms 
and bigotry of a tasteless age, too long attached to 
the prejudices of custom, and superstitiously de- 
voted to the illusions of imposing declamation." 
The volume contains sixteen portraits, some from 
rare originals, in half-tone. 



Memories of 
some notable 
New Englanders. 



In a dainty booklet entitled " Under 
the Old Elms" (Crowell), Mrs. 

Majy g Clafl j n hag gathered to . 

gether a sheaf of memories of the notable men and 
women who have from time to time visited Gov- 
ernor Claflin's historic estate at Newtonville, Mass- 
achusetts. One is glad to find throughout Mrs. 
Claflin's pleasant pages a prevailing note of that 
kindly tact and refinement which is too often con- 
spicuously absent from books dealing in the ticklish 
matter of personal chat and reminiscence. It is so 
easy to compel a little notice for one's self by say- 
ing sharp things of other people. Among the names 
mentioned by Mrs. Claflin we note : Charles Sum- 
ner, Henry Drummond, Whittier, Rev. Newman 
Hall, Mrs. Stowe, Henry Ward Beecher, Rev. 
James Freeman Clarke, etc. A characteristic story 
is told of impulsive Professor Agassiz. At an edu- 
cational meeting at Boston, an English gentleman, 
the speaker of the occasion and a man " somewhat 
renowned as a practical educator in his own coun- 
try," shocked his democratic auditors by asking 
with unexpected candor : " I do not understand 
how you conduct your public schools. How do 
you know that your child will not be obliged to sit 
by a wash-woman's child or a blacksmith's child ? " 



Professor Agassiz rose to the emergency : " The 
glory of our country is that we have no wash- 
woman's children or blacksmith's children as such ; 
and all we have to fear is that the wash-woman's 
child will go ahead of our children, and leave them 
in the background." Without doubting either the 
Professor's sincerity or the theoretic democratism 
of his hearers, one would really like to know, as a 
matter of cold fact, just how many of the ladies 
and gentlemen present did not every day of their 
lives carry into practice in some way or degree the 
spirit underlying the query of the candid Briton. 
The volume contains a pretty frontispiece represent- 
ing the " Old Elms." 



Mr. Shearman on 



A little book by Mr. Thomas G. 
the Single Tax. Shearman entitled " Natural Taxa- 
tion " has been added to the " Ques- 
tions of the Day" series (Putnam). The author 
is well known as the leading advocate of the "sin- 
gle tax limited "; that is, the collection of all nec- 
essary revenues of government by the taxation of 
land values, without necessarily absorbing their en- 
tire amount. The single tax is sometimes opposed 
on the ground that economic rent, at least in new 
and poor communities, would not suffice to pay the 
expenses of government ; but Mr. Shearman gives 
figures to show that, on the contrary, the necessary 
taxes would absorb less than one-half of the land- 
owners' gains. The " single tax limited " accord- 
ing to this calculation would not destroy private 
property in land ; and Mr. Shearman treats it rather 
as a method of tax reform than as a means of abol- 
ishing landlords. His point of departure is quite 
different from that of Mr. Henry George and his 
disciples, and he is somewhat less extreme in his 
conclusions ; yet he claims many wonderful and de- 
sirable things as necessary results of the system he 
proposes. Perhaps the strongest part of his argu- 
ment is that in which he shows the weakness of ex- 
isting forms of taxation. He is particularly fero- 
cious in his attack upon import duties and other 
forms of indirect taxation, which he re -names 
" crooked taxation," to make the designation as op- 
probious as possible. Four chapters are devoted to 
the failure of the general property tax, and to its 
disproportionate burden upon the rural population 
and upon widows and orphans. Mr. Shearman 
calls his proposed system " natural taxation," be- 
cause he looks upon ground rents as a kind of inev- 
itable tax, whether collected by the government or 
by the individual land-owner. 

The important place now held by

social accomplishments ensures a wel-

now, even at comparatively lax tables, carried to a 
point that must not only have won the approval but

outrun the ideal of that " gentlewoman born." In 
the little book before us, " The Evolution of Whist " 
(Longmans), the eminent authority Mr. William 
Pole traces the natural history of the game, from 
its small and obscure beginnings in the sixteenth 
century down to its present highly evolved form. 
While the work is primarily a careful scientific 
study stamped throughout with a proper sense of 
the dignity of its theme, it is by no means a mere 
curious collection of dry facts and dates. Unlike 
many scientific writers, Mr. Pole is not above writ- 
ing down to the popular comprehension, and cloth- 
ing his serious theme and purpose in the attractive 
garb of an alluring and agreeable style. After an 
interesting general introduction, he proceeds to treat 
his subject under the four main heads : " The Prim- 
itive Era" (1500-1730); "The Era of Hoyle" 
(1730-1860); "The Philosophical Era" (from 
1860 onwards); and " Latter-Day Developments " 
the last division embracing a critical review of 
modern changes and innovations, together with a 
complimentary chapter on whist in America. Touch- 
ing the status of the game in this country, the writer 
cites approvingly the statement of " Cavendish " 
(who visited us in '93) that " there is no sort of 
comparison to be made between the American and 
the European players the former possessing a 
general quality of excellence which is almost un- 
known here or which, at any rate, it has been the 
habit to attribute only to exceptional persons like 
Deschapelles, appearing once in an age." This, like 
the approbation of Sir Hubert Stanley, is " praise 
indeed," and should serve as a lenitive to interna- 
tional smarts. Mr. Pole's pleasantly written and 
neatly made little book ought to find its way into 
the hands of every whist-player desiring a critical 
knowledge of the game.

and method, and of his success in adapting his work 
to the special audience he addresses. The Rev. Dr. 
Clark is a hero-worshipper, and Oliver Cromwell is 
his one hero. As his introducer says of the work, 
" It is a book of enthusiasm, a warm-hearted vindi- 
cation of a great man . . . written with fervor." 
The fervor shows itself in thickly sprinkled exclam- 
ation points and ejaculations of admiration called 
out by the hero's acts or qualities. The audience 
addressed is a supposed general public whose idea 
of Cromwell, if it has any, has been gained from 
the hostile pages of Hume. The book is written 
topically in ten chapters. The first, very good in 
its way, is a discussion of the defamatory writers 
who shaped the world's opinion of Cromwell until 
recently ; the second treats of Carlyle's work ; the 
others speak of Cromwell under the heads of " Early 
Life." " Farmer " " Warrior " PaiOSomawf orJ

seems very inadequate for a proper conception of 
his work. In this respect the book compares un- 
favorably with Mr. Frederic Harrison's volume, 
which is of about the same size, but makes the 
statesman, the warrior, and the man stand before 
us clearly outlined. This lack of facts is not made 
good by the constant eulogy which every page fur- 
nishes. Cromwell's character and deeds, properly 
presented, need no eulogy to convince men of their 
greatness. 

The late Professor Thomas Hill 
Green was known at Oxford quite 
as much for his personal influence 
and his unselfish life of social service as for his 
scholarly philosophical work. To the general public 
he is less well known than he ought to be ; but many 
readers of " Robert Elsmere " will remember that 
he was one of Mrs. Ward's two friends to whose 
memory she dedicated the book. He was also the 
model from whom she drew the character of " Henry 
Grey." That portion of Professor Green's philo- 
sophical works which treats of theories of the state 
has now been reprinted under the title " Lectures 
on the Principles of Political Obligation" (Long- 
mans). The subject is one in which the author ap- 
pears at his best, and upon which he is well entitled 
to be heard ; for he had an unusually acute sense 
of political duty. The volume contains his lectures 
upon such themes as the different senses of the 
term " freedom," the grounds of political obligation, 
sovereignty, private rights, the rights of the state, 
etc. The political theories of various earlier writ- 
ers are examined, but particular attention is paid to 
Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. The method 
of treatment is metaphysical for the most part, but 
is partly historical ; and in connection with the 
rights of the state in regard to property, morality, 
and the family, certain very practical questions are 
considered. 

Continuation of The f ourth volume of Prof essor Free- 
Pro/. Freeman's man's " History of Sicily " (Mac- 
History of Sicily. m in an ) j s devoted to the interesting 
period which extends from the beginning of the 
tyranny of Dionysius to the death of Agathocles, 
B.C. 405 to 289. The considerable gaps in the manu- 
script as left by the author have been in part bridged 
by passages quoted from his " Story of Sicily "; but 
his own narrative, so far as completed, had been 
written with much care, and well merited publica- 
tion. The point of view and method of treatment 
are the same as in the previous volumes (see THE 
DIAL for Oct. 1, 1892, pp. 214-15). This book 
is edited by Professor Freeman's son-in-law, the 
well known archaeologist at the Ashmolean Museum, 
Mr. Arthur J. Evans. To him are due many notes 
and several valuable supplements to the three chap- 
ters, of which the latter in particular quite offset 
his modest disclaimer in the preface regarding his 
fitness for the task laid upon him by force of cir- 
cumstances ; the first supplement, on the tyranny 
of Dionysius, is in breadth of view and political

insight quite worthy of Freeman himself. The ser- 
vices of archaeology as " the handmaid of historical 
investigation " are well illustrated in the later sup- 
plements on the coinage of Dionysius, Timoleon, 
and Agathocles, as casting light on the events with 
which their names are associated. The volume is 
illustrated with four excellent maps and a numis- 
matic plate. 

It is difficult to discover enough that 
is new concerning Louis XIV. to 
change the judgment of history in 
regard to him. Mr. Arthur Hassall would proba- 
bly be the last to claim the discovery of new facts 
for his work, " Louis XIV. and the Zenith of the 
French Monarchy" (Putnam). The interesting 
feature of the book is its point of view. The writ- 
ing of history sometimes moves in a circle. Time 
was when Louis XIV. was f ulsomely praised ; this 
was while he was yet alive. When he died, the 
Parliament annulled his will ; cries of joy greeted 
the news of his decease ; history has singled him out 
as the real author of the French Revolution. Of late, 
however, criticism has swung around to the original 
point ; and Mr. Hassall's work represents this atti- 
tude. But the attitude is an unfortunate one. The 
book is a study in hero-worship, and in so far it 
conforms to the spirit of the series (" Heroes of the 
Nations ") in which it appears ; but sober history 
suffers in the process. In his zeal to make Louis 
XIV. a hero, the author tells us that " Louis has 
certainly as great a claim as Napoleon to be consid- 
ered a Hero "; he characterizes Louis as the " most 
hard-working, pains-taking, and on the whole suc- 
cessful ruler " France has had; and finally declares 
that " Louis's reign, as far as military glory was 
concerned, is the most glorious in the annals of 
French history " (pp. 2-4). This calm disparage- 
ment of Bonaparte surely will be a death-blow to 
the prevailing Napoleonic revival. From these 
opinions, the character of the book may be inferred. 

In a pretty booklet of some two hun- 
dred and fifty diminutive pages, en- 
titled " The Flower of England's 
Face " (Macmillan), Mrs. Julia C. R. Dorr de- 
scribes in her cheery way some of the more notable 
places visited by her during a recent trip to En- 
gland. Mrs. Dorr's sketches are ranged under such 
pleasantly suggestive titles as " A Week in Wales," 
"In the Forest of Arden," "At Haworth," "To 
Cawdor Castle and Culloden Moor," " From the 
Border to Inverness," etc.; and we need scarcely 
say that the little bits of scenery and genre are 
touched in with a dainty and sympathetic hand. A 
pilgrimage to the Bronte" country resulted in a sheaf 
of interesting anecdotes and impressions of the 
gifted sisters. One elderly witness who had known 
the Bronte" family well, "saw Miss Charlotte very 
often, almost every day. She wor nothing to look 
at. She wor a little thing, little and shy. She did 
not lift up her eyes. She wor quiet, and kept out 



o' the way. They wor all great all great, every 
one of them. But, you see, we did not know it till 
they wor dead." So it is that the recognition most 
longed for comes latest usually too late. 

stage studies of Decidedly the brightest and freshest 
Shakespeare's book of its kind that has come to our 
heroines. notice of late ig Mr Charles E. L. 

Wingate's " Shakespeare's Heroines on the Stage " 
(Crowell). While Mr. Wingate's work is largely 
based on researches in the regions of moth and dust 
and documental chaos, the depressing nature of his 
preliminary labors has left no regrettable traces on 
his style. The book is piquant and chatty, descrip- 
tive and anecdotal rather than critical, yet critical 
enough to convey a fair impression of the distinctive 
qualities and merits of its heroines. Its point is 
fairly expressed in the title, the author's aim being to 
present, briefly and vividly, critical pen-portraits of 
those famous actresses, past and present, most worth- 
ily identified with Shakespeare's women. Thus, in 
the chapter headed " Juliet " are grouped Mrs. Bel- 
lamy, Mrs. Gibber, Miss O'Neill, Miss Cushman, 
Mary Anderson, Mrs. Duff, Mrs. Mowatt, etc. A 
feature of the book is the illustrations, which, rang- 
ing from the days of " Peg " Woffington and the 
saucy Clive, down to the notable Juliets, Rosalinds, 
Ophelias, and Lady Macbeths of our times, form a 
veritable gallery of players.

for a High School has been gaining ground that the 
Classical Library, standards of classical education can 
only be raised by helping the teachers to do better 
work ; and that while something may be said about 
method, it is scholarship that counts in the long run. 
American high schools and the same is true of 
most small colleges are notoriously deficient in 
the appliances of classical teaching, whether in the 
way of books or of illustrative material. With a 
view to remedying this unfortunate condition, the 
Michigan Schoolmasters' Club in 1894 appointed a 
committee to make a select bibliography of the 
classical books most essential to high school and pre- 
paratory work. The committee succeeded in inter- 
esting a score of the leading classical men in various 
parts, who contributed suggestions and criticisms. 
The "List of Books Recommended for a High 
School Classical Library," now published by the com- 
mittee, contains 480 titles, carefully classified, with 
precise information regarding editions, publishers, 
and prices. This list will be found invaluable by 
teachers who wish to strengthen their work in the 
ancient languages and ancient history. A copy will 
be sent gratis on application to the chairman of 
the committee (Mr. C. L. Meader, 33 S. Thayer St., 
Ann Arbor, Mich.), with enclosure of a two-cent 
stamp for postage.

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have added six volumes 
to their handsome library edition of the novels of 
Charles Lever. The novels now published are " Roland 
Cashel " and " Con Cregan," in two volumes each; and 
" Maurice Tiernay " and " Sir Jasper Carew," each in 
a single volume. The illustrations are etchings by 
" Phiz " and Mr. E. Van Muyden. The volumes are 
tastefully bound in dark green and gold, and present 
a highly dignified appearance upon the shelf. 

Quite a number of annotated English texts for school 
use have recently come to hand. Messrs. Macmillan & 
Co. publish " King Henry the Eighth," edited by Mr. K. 
Deighton; the " Essays of Elia," edited by Messrs. N. L. 
Hallward and S. C. Hill; and Tennyson's "Lancelot 
and Elaine," edited by Mr. F. J. Rowe. These books 
are very neat and attractive. From Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. we have, in equally attractive get-up, Irv- 
ing's " Tales of a Traveller," edited by Professors Brau- 
der Matthews and George R. Carpenter; Defoe's " Jour- 
nal of the Plague Year," edited by Professor Carpenter; 
and George Eliot's " Silas Marner," edited by Mr. Rob- 
ert Herrick. Another edition of Defoe's " Plague " 
comes from Messrs. Maynard, Merrill & Co., but no 
one seems to be responsible for the editing. The same 
remark applies to the American Book Company's edi- 
tion of As You Like It." 

Mr. Gosse writes of Walter Pater, Mr. R. C. Christie 
of Mark Pattison, Dr. Garnett of T. L. Peacock, and 
Principal Ward of Peele, in the forty-fourth volume of 
the " Dictionary of National Biography " (Macmillan). 
The longest articles in this volume, which runs from 
Paston to Percy, are those on William Penn, by Mr. J. 
M. Rigg, and on Robert Peel the second, by the Hon. 
George Peel. 

" Le Francois Idiomatique," a collection of French 
idioms and proverbs, made by M. Victor F. Bernard, 
is published by W. R. Jenkins, who also sends us 
an edition of "Athalie," edited by M. C. Fontaine, 
and of " La Fille de Roland," edited by Dr. W. L. 
Montague. From the American Book Co. comes a 
small volume, " First Year in French," by M. L. C. 
Syms. Professor E. Bergeron's edition of Eugenie 
Grandet " (Holt), very neat in get-up, has been on our 
table for some time, and should have had a word of 
commendation before now. Professor B. W. Wells has 

condensed a process we cannot approve M. Dau- 

det's "La Nabab" (Ginn) for a school text. Finally, 
we have from Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. an edition of 
"Athalie," edited by Dr. C. A. Eggert, and one of 
Labiche's ever-delightful Perrichon," edited by Pro- 
fessor B. W. Wells. 

"The Idiomatic Study of German" (Peck), by Dr. 
Otto Kuphal; and "Der Praktische Deutsche" (Jen- 
kins), by Herr U. Joseph Beiley, are the latest appli- 
cants for favor with teachers of the German language. 
Recently published German texts include " Maria Stu- 
art" (Macmillan), edited by Dr. C. A. Buchheim, 
being Volume XIII. in the Clarendon Press series of 
"German Classics"; a relume of "Selections from P. 
K. Rosegger's Waldheimat,'" (Ginn), edited by Mr. 
Laurence Fossler; and Herr Heinrich Seidel's "Die 
Monate " (American Book Co.), edited by Dr. R. Ar- 
rowsmith. 

" Hajji Baba of Ispahan " is just now enjoying a new 
lease of life. We noted not long ago the publication 



of a reprint of that fascinating narrative in the Mac- 
inillan series of old-fashioned fiction, and now Messrs 
Stone & Kimball send us another reprint of the book, 
which fills two volumes in their extremely attractive 
series of " English Classics." Mr. E. G. Browne pro- 
vides this edition with an introduction. The series in 
question, which is under the editorship of Mr. W. E. 
Henley, aims to reproduce well-known works in a form 
at once beautiful and inexpensive, an aim, we may add, 
which is successfully reached, judging from the volumes 
before us. 



TO ENGLAND. 



Now England lessens on my sight; 

The bastioned front of Wales, 
Discolored and indefinite, 

There, like a cloud-wreath, sails. 
A league, and all yon thronging hills 

Shall sink beneath the sea; 
But while one touch of Memory thrills, 

They yet shall stay with me. 

I claim no birthright in yon sod, 

Though thence my blood and name; 
My sires another empire trod, 

Fought for another fame. 
Yet a son's tear this moment wrongs 

My eager watching eyes, 
Land of the lordliest deeds and songs 

Since Greece was great and wise! 

Thou hedgerow thing that queenest the Earth, 

What magic hast ? what art ? 
A thousand years of work and worth 

Are clustered at thine heart! 
The ghosts of those that made thee free 

To throng thy hearth are wont; 
And as thy richest reliquary 

Thou wearest thine Abbey's front! 

Aye, ere my distance is complete 

I see thy heroes come 
And crowd yon shadowy mountain seat, 

Still guardians of their home; 
Thy Drake, thy Nelson, and thy Bruce 

Glow out o'er dusky tides; 
The rival roses blend in truce, 

And King with Roundhead rides. 

And with such phantoms born to last, 

A storm of music breaks; 
And bards pavillioned in the past 

Each from his tomb awakes: 
The ring and glitter of thy swords, 

Thy lovers' glow and breath, 
By them transmuted into words, 

Redeem the world from Death. 

My path is West! My heart before 

Bounds o'er the dancing wave; 
Yet something 's left I must deplore 

A magic wild and grave ; 
Though Honor live and Romance dwell 

By native stream and wood, 
Yet not in keep and spire so well 

Is throned each lofty mood.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" Our Industrial Utopia," by President D. H. Wheeler, 
and " That Dome in Air," a volume of literary criti- 
cism by Mr. John Vance Cheney, are announced by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

Balzac's " Le Me'decin de Campagne," now called 
" The Country Doctor," and translated by Miss Ellen 
Marriage (Macmillan), has just appeared in Mr. Saints- 
bury's edition of the novelist. 

Richard Jones on "Peasant Rents" (1831) is the 
latest of Professor Ashley's " Economic Classics " (Mac- 
millan), and will soon be followed by Professor Schmol- 
ler's essay on " The Mercantile System." 

A new translation of Count Tolstoy's " Master and 
Man," by Messrs. S. Rapoport and John C. Kenworthy, 
is published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. This is 
the third version that has come to our table. 

" The Union," described as " a semi-monthly journal 
for English and Americans in Germany," is a sprightly 
little paper that comes to us from Wiesbaden, with 
Miss Linda M. Prussing, of Chicago, as " responsible 
editor." 

An " Index Antiphonteus," prepared by Dr. Frank 
Louis Van Cleef, is the latest issue of the " Cornell 
Studies in Classical Philology " (Ginn). It makes a 
volume of 173 pages, and is printed entirely in Greek 
and Latin. 

" The Boy in Grey," the closing volume of Messrs. 
Ward, Lock & Bowden's edition of the novels of Henry 
Kingsley, will soon be issued, and will contain an illus- 
trated biographical sketch of the author, by his nephew, 
Mr. Maurice Kingsley. 

The Rev. Stephen D. Peet, editor of "The American 
Antiquarian and Oriental Journal " (just beginning its 
eighteenth volume, by the way), is about to publish a 
work entitled " Prehistoric America." The address of 
Dr. Peet is Good Hope, Illinois. 

Robert Beverly Hale, the youngest son of the Rev. 
Edward Everett Hale, died on the sixth of this month. 
He was only twenty-five years of age, but had become 
somewhat known as a writer for the magazines, and 
was a young man of considerable literary promise. 

Mrs. Clara Doty Bates, the well known writer of 
stories for the young,-died at her home in Chicago, Oc- 
tober 14. She was born in Michigan in 1838. Her 



works include many volumes of juveniles, and a volume 
of verse. She was a frequent contributor to the pe- 
riodicals for the young. 

Miss Maud Wilder Goodwin's " The Colonial Cava- 
lier," reviewed by us last March, has come into the 
hands of Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., who republish 
it in handsome holiday form, with many illustrations by 
Mr. Harry Edwards. It is an excellent book, and de- 
serves to become widely known. 

The University and Normal School of North Dakota 
having been closed, owing to the neglect of a recalci- 
trant legislature to make the appropriations necessary 
for their support, a private movement has been started 
to provide for their expenses by a series of popular lec- 
tures, concerts, and other entertainments. We wish the 
movement all success, and understand that it has already 
done much toward the accomplishment of its purpose. 

Sir Walter Besant has written to an American friend 
that, although he is sure the project will at first meet 
with derision, he intends, as soon as he can conveniently 
do so, to agitate the subject of another Authors' Con- 
gress, to be held in his country. He believes that the 
recent Authors' .Congress at Chicago was "as impor- 
tant to the future of literature and the rights of au- 
thors as the Bering Sea Arbitration or the Monetary 
Conference were to the commercial interests of nations." 

Mr. W. L. Phelps is giving a course in modern fiction 
at Yale, and the novels to be taken up before Christ- 
mas are the following ten: " Lorna Doone," " Marcella," 
" A Modern Instance," " Esther Waters," " A Gentle- 
man of France," " Treasure Island," " Trilby," and vol- 
umes of short stories by Mr. Bret Harte, Mr. Kipling, 
and Professor Henry Beers. The latter name doubt- 
less appears in deference to local sentiment. It would 
hardly have been thought of anywhere but in New 
Haven. 

Following Mr. T. Fisher Unwin's retirement from 
the London agency of the "Century Magazine," we 
have the announcement of a new monthly magazine to 
be launched by him with the new year, to be called 
" Cosinopolis," and to appear contemporaneously in 
London, Berlin, and Paris. It will contain original 
articles in English, French, and German; while a special 
feature will be chronicles of the literary, political, 
and theatrical occurrences of the month in Germany, 
France, and England. 

Mr. F. J. Furnivall, writing about the neglect of En- 
glish in common school education, shows by a quotation 
from the statutes of Brunton Grammar School, dated 
1519, that the evil is of ancient date. The Statutes say 
that the " maister shall not teche his scolers song, nor 
other petite lerninge, as the Crosse Rewe, redyng of 
the Mateyns, or of the Psalter, or such other small 
thyngs, nether redyng of Englissh, butt such as shall con- 
cerne lernynge of gramer For the Founders of the said 
scole intend, with our lordes mercy, only to have the 
grammer of Latyn tongue so sufficiently taught, that 
the scolers, of the same profityng and provyng, shall in 
tyme to come forever be, after their capacities perfight 
Latyn men." 

We learn from the " Athenaeum " that the French 
government has sent out invitations to a conference to 
those states which joined in 1886 the Literary Conven- 
tion of Berne. According to a special stipulation, a 
conference was to have been summoned by France 
after a lapse of four or six years from that date for 
the purpose of revising the convention, but hitherto

[Oct. 16, 



the government of France has not considered it oppor- 
tune to take any steps in the matter. It has done so 
now, fixing April 15, 1896, as the date for another 
conference, with the intention of submitting for discus- 
sion a programme based on the result of the investiga- 
tions carried on since 1886, both by the French Gov- 
ernment and the Berne Bureau. It is to be hoped that 
those states which have not yet joined the Berne Con- 
vention will also be invited to send representatives to 
the next conference, in order to induce them to join it. 
The increasing vogue of Omar Khayyam is evidenced 
by the announcement (by the Joseph Knight Co.) of a 
variorum edition of the " Rubaiyat." The standard is 
the fourth edition of FitzGerald's version; this is fol- 
lowed, quatrain by quatrain, by M. Nicolas's French 
prose translation; Mr. Justin Huntley McCarthy's En- 
glish prose version; the Whinfield translation of 1889 
(with the variants of the translation of 1882) ; several 
representative versions from Mr. John Leslie Garner's 
Milwaukee edition; then the German versions of Boden- 
stedt and Graf von Schack. Appendices will contain 
full notes, a considerable number of additional Rubai- 
yat illustrating GitzGerald's translation or specially 
characteristic of the Persian poet. The volume will 
contain nearly everything that throws any light on his 
life and genius Gautier's appreciation, Dean Plum- 
tre's interesting comparison between Omar and Eccles- 
iastes, a sketch of FitzGerald's life, and a full biblio- 
graphy. 

The Oxford University Press now uses the famous 
Oxford India paper for more than 160 different pub- 
lications. This paper, of which the secret is carefully 
guarded, is unequalled for thinness combined with opa- 
city and strength. It is stated in " Book Reviews " that 
at the Paris Exhibition " volumes of 1500 pages were 
seen suspended during the whole period of the Exhibi- 
tion by a single leaf, opaque, although as thin as tissue; 
and when, at the close of the Exhibition, they were 
taken down and examined, the leaf that had sustained 
the weight had not started, the paper had not stretched, 
and the solid gilt edge of the volume when closed re- 
vealed no mark to show where the strain had been 
applied. The paper when subjected to severe rubbing, 
instead of breaking into holes, assumed a texture re- 
sembling chamois leather, and a strip only three inches 
wide was found able to support a quarter of a hundred- 
weight without yielding." One can get editions of 
Bibles, Prayer-books, Shakespeare, Dante, and Virgil, j 
printed upon this paper, and all are marvels of compact 
bookmaking. 

The first number, dated October, of " The American 
Historical Review" has just made its appearance, and 
adds one more to the lengthening list of our serious and 
scholarly periodicals. It will probably share the fate j 
of its fellows in respect of public support, for it is much 
too good to be likely to find any considerable number 
of subscribers outside the narrow circle of historical 
students. Its expenses are, we understand, met by the 
universities under whose auspices it appears. Its Board 
of Editors is made up of six men, all of the highest 
standing, and they have shown the best of judgment in 
selecting Professor J. F. Jameson as their managing 
editor. The issue before us is a stately octavo of 208 
pages, about one-half of which are filled with special 
articles and newly-printed documents, while the other 
half are devoted to reviews and miscellaneous matter. 
Our only criticism upon the number shall be an expres- 



sion of our amazement upon discovering that the sheets 
were fastened together by wires, instead of being de- 
cently sewn. The imprint of Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 
should have made that offence impossible. 

Mr. R. H. Sherard, writing from Paris to " The Au- 
thor," discourses amusingly of what he calls " literary 
blacklegs." In Paris, he says, " no successful author 
would read the manuscript of another author for a pub- 
lisher; in Paris no successful author would write, other- 
wise than under his own signature, a criticism on an- 
other author's book; in Paris no author would espouse 
the cause of the publisher who, qua publisher, is the au- 
thor's antagonist. In London a number of blacklegs 
Do you know them ? Yes, I do are doing this daily, 
hourly, minutely, and, like sheep before the shearers, 
we are dumb. We even invite them, some to a drink, 
some to a week in our country-houses. Let us, for our 
protection, form a Vehmgericht, or since in this age 
we must be practical, let us have a black book, privately 
printed and privately circulated, in which the blacklegs 
or black sheep in our midst are denotated and set down ; 
a waistcoat pocket booklet with their names and ad- 
dresses; so that when we meet the literary blackleg we 
may show him the fall of our coats, velvet or shoddy, 
over the shoulders, and waist, and beyond." This is 
hard, to say the least, on such publishers' readers as 
Mr. George Meredith, and the distinguished critics who 
contribute literary reviews to the anonymous English 
press.

-PAUL AND VIRGINIA OF A 
NORTHERN ZONE. 

A Romance. Translated from the Danish of HOLGER 
DRACHMANN, with Introductory Note by Mr. FRAX- 
cis F. BROWNE. Daintily printed and bound, with 
cover design by Mr. BRUCE ROGERS. Gilt top, un- 
cut, $1.25. 

In introducing to American readers the work of the popu- 
lar Danish novelist Holger Drachmann, the publishers have 
selected "Paul and Virginia of a Northern Zone " as one of 
the most characteristic and attractive of his shorter tales. It 
is a story of simple life upon a Northern Strand, of storm and 
wreck at sea, of youth and its triumphant love. The work is 
at once romantic and realistic, written in a charming poetic 
style, with masterly descriptive power, and strong coloring 
from the scenes and life where it is laid.

THE CENTURY FOR NOVEMBER, 

Ready Friday, November 1st, will be 

AN ANNIVERSARY NUMBER, 

Celebrating the beginning of the fifty-first volume of THE CENTURY MAGAZINE. It will contain a 
brilliant table of contents, including a great number of illustrations, with a figure from Titian's " Sacred 
and Profane Love," engraved by Cole, as a frontispiece ; articles on " The Issues of 1896," the Repub- 
lican view by Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, and the Democratic view by Ex-Gov. William E. Russell, of 
Massachusetts ; a richly illustrated paper on " Mural Decoration in America," with illustrations from 
decorations by John La Farge, John S. Sargent, Edwin A. Abbey, Edward Simmons, and Thomas W. 
Dewing ; an article on " The Armenian Question," by the Hon. James Bryce ; a sketch of the life of 
the famous painter Vibert, contributed by himself ; a story by Bret Harte ; an interesting sociological 
study by W. D. Howells ; etc., etc. The number will also contain the first instalment of 



"Sir George Tressady," 

Author of "Robert Elsmere," "Marcella," etc. 

The scene of this story, upon which Mrs. Ward has been engaged for the last two years, is laid in 
the England of to-day, the world to which the readers will be introduced being partly industrial and 
partly that of the English country-house. All serial rights to this story for America and England 
have been secured by THE CENTURY, and " Sir George Tressady " will be the leading feature in fiction 
for the twelve months of the magazine beginning with November, 1895. 



The leading historical feature for the year will continue to be Professor Sloane's " Napoleon," 
which with November reaches the establishment of the Empire and begins the story of 

NAPOLEON I., EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH. 

This biography is considered " A masterpiece of historical literature "; " The best biography of 
the great Frenchman yet issued "; " The ablest of all histories of this remarkable character "; " A 
tremendous popular success "; " The literary event of the season." 



OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES 

Of THE CENTURY to appear during the coming year include novelettes by W. D. Howells, F. Hop- 
kinson Smith, Mary Hallock Foote, and Amelia E. Barr ; contributions from Mark Twain 
and Rudyard Kipling; a series of articles on the great naval engagements of Nelson, by Captain 
Alfred T. Mahan, author of " Influence of Sea Power upon History "; three brilliant articles on 
Rome, contributed by Marion Crawford, and superbly illustrated by Castaigne ; a series of articles 
by George Kennan, author of " Siberia and the Exile System," on the Mountains and the Moun- 
taineers of the Eastern Caucasus, describing a little-known people ; articles by Henry M. Stanley 
and E. J. Qlave on Africa; a series of papers on "The Administration of the Cities of the United 
States," by Dr. Albert Shaw. THE CENTURY will also contain during the year a great number of 
papers on art subjects, richly illustrated. Many of its important contributions, now in preparation, 
will be announced later. 

THE NEW VOLUME begins with the November number. Subscription price, $4.00 a year. For $5.00 
new subscribers can have a year's subscription beginning with November, 1895, and all the numbers of the past 
year from November, 1894, the beginning of Professor Sloane's great Life of Napoleon. All dealers take sub-

our great experiment they have a profound interest, and Mr. Scott has treated them 
with marked ability. It is a work of wide research and patient investigation of

unquestioned rank as poetry. The book has sufficient variety, no little humor, a 
delightful freshness, and ought to find a large audience.

"This is a handsomely printed, well illustrated volume of 394 pages, 
reciting the explorations and adventures of nine years in this historic 
land. Its graphic, concise descriptions of famous places now in ruins 
and its clear pen pictures of the people that live and wander over these 
lands are both entertaining and profitable reading. " The Chicago Inter 
Ocean (Sept. 14, 1895.) 

"Palmyra is chiefly known for its ruins and its traditions of Zeno- 
bia's illustrious reign. To both of these Dr. Wright does more justice 
than is commonly expected from traveller's tales. He has occupied 
himself with original research and the study of inscriptions, so that his 
narrative has a very different style from that of the vapid, second-hand 
and tenth-rate literature of the majority of unprofessional travellers. 
Much entertainment as well as much information may be found in this

and sense on all public topics of the hour. It is 
a singular combination of the monthly magazine 
and the daily newspaper. It is daily in its fresh- 
ness ; it is monthly in its method. It is the world 
under a field-glass. If we were the teacher of a 
school we should use the REVIEW OP REVIEWS as 
a reader, and so make it do duty as an illustrated 
text-book in current history."

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SELBORNE, 

And Observations on Nature. By GILBERT WHITE. With 
an Introduction by JOHN BURROUGHS, 80 Illustrations by 
CLIFTON JOHNSON, and the Text and New Letters of the 
Buckland Edition. In 2 vols. 12mo, cloth, $4.00. 
In order to present a satisfactory and final edition of this classic of 
Gilbert White's, Mr. Clifton Johnson visited Selborne and secured pic- 
tures of the actual scenes amid which White's life was passed. The 
photographs and the drawings form in themselves a most delightful gal- 
lery of pictures of unspoiled English rural life. This new edition can 
not be neglected by anyone who cares for Nature or for the classics of 
English literature. 

UNCLE REMUS. 

His Songs and his Sayings. By JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS. 

New and revised edition, with 112 Illustrations by A. B. 

FROST. 12mo, cloth, $2.00. 

It is unnecessary to say anything in praise of Mr. A. B. Frost's unfal- 
tering individuality, his instant realization of types, his quaint and un- 
expected turns of humor, and the constant quality of absolutely true 
and individual pictorial expression of things American. Of the enthu- 
siasm and perfect comprehension and sympathy shown in his 112 draw- 
ings the public can judge, and there can be no doubt that the verdict 
will stamp these pictures as the artist's crowning work in illustration. 
This is the final, the definitive edition of Mr. Harris's masterpiece. 

Also, an Edition de luxe of the above, with the full-page 
cuts mounted on India paper. 8vo, white vellum, gilt, $10.00. 



CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY. 

By Professor E. FKRRI. A new volume in the Criminology 
Series, edited by W. DOUGLAS MORRISON. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

In this volume, Professor Ferri, a distinguished member of the 
Italian Parliament, deals with the conditions which produce the crim- 
nal population, and with the methods by which this anti-social section 
of the community may be diminished. His view is that the true remedy 
against crime is to remove individual defects and social disadvantages 
where it is possible to remove them. He shows that punishment has 
comparatively little effect in this direction, and is apt to direct atten- 
tion from the true remedy the individual and social amelioration of 
the population as a whole. 



ANTHONY HOPE'S NEW ROMANCE. 

THE CHRONICLES OF COUNT ANTONIO. 

By ANTHONY HOPE, author of " The God in the Car," " The 

Prisoner of Zenda," etc. With colored Frontispiece by S. 

W. VAN SCHAICK. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"The Prisoner of Zenda " proved Mr. Hope's power as the author of 
a fighting romance, and his pen again becomes a sword in this pictur- 
esque and thrilling story of a mediaeval Italian paladin, whose character 
will recall the Chevalier Bayard to the reader who breathlessly follows 
him through his adventures and dangers. 

" Mr. Hope has been rapidly recognized by critics and by the general 
public as the cleverest and most entertaining of our latest-born novel- 
ists." Si. James Gazette. 

"All his work impresses with qualities to mark a rarely cultivated 
mind and art." Boston Globe. 

" Mr. Hope is a master at the work. His construction is in every 
way admirable. He lays an excellent foundation in the choice of other 
characters, and then he marshals his incidents with consummate art." 
Milwaukee Journal. 

" It is a great achievement nowadays to be entertaining, and that Mr. 
Hope is, in his lively, fantastic, dramatic, impossible little stories." 
Chicago Journal. 



THE PSYCHOLOGY OF NUMBER, 

And its Applications to Methods of Teaching Arithmetic. By 
JAMES A. MCL.ELLAN, A.M., LL.D., Principal of the On- 
tario School of Pedagogy, Toronto, and JOHN DEWEY, 
Ph.D., Head Professor of Philosophy in the University of 
Chicago. International Education Series, Vol. 33. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

It is believed that this work will supply a special want. There is no 
subject taught in the elementary schools that taxes the teacher's re- 
sources as to methods and devices to a greater extent than arithmetic, 
and none that is more dangerous to the pupil in the way of deadening 
his mind and arresting its development, if bad methods are used. The 
authors of this book have presented in an admirable manner the psy- 
chological view of number, and shown its applications to the correct 
methods of teaching the several arithmetical processes. 



THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. 

A Tale of the Civil War. By STEPHEN CRANE. 12mo, 

cloth, $1.00. 

For an equally searching and graphic analysis of the volunteer in 
battle, one is tempted to turn to certain pages of Tolstoy. Mr. Crane 
puts before us the reality of war as it appeared to the soldier, and the 
interest of his picture is intense and absorbing. 



THE STARK MUNRO LETTERS. 

Being a Series of Twelve Letters written by J. STARK MUNRO, 
M.B., to his Friend and Fellow-Student, Herbert Swan- 
borough, of Lowell, Mass., 1881-1884. Edited and arranged 
by A. CONAN DOYLE, author of "Round the Red Lamp," 
" The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," etc. With 8 full- 
page Illustrations. Third Edition. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" ' The Stark Munro Letters ' is a bit of real literature. ... Its read- 
ing will be an epoch-making event in many a life." Philadelphia 
Evening Telegraph. 

" Will be as successful, when it becomes known, as any Couan Doyle 
has written." New York Times. 

"Positively magnetic, and written with that combined force and 
grace for which the author's style is known." Boston Budget. 



IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. 

A Romance of the American Revolution. By CHAUNCEY C. 

HOTCHKISS. No. 178, Town and Country Library. 12mo, 

paper, 50 cents ; cloth, $1.00. 

In this American historical romance, by a new writer of rare promise, 
there is unfolded a stirring tale of patriotic adventure ranging from 
Lexington, the burning of Norwalk, the British occupation of Long 
Island, and thrilling experiences on Long Island Sound, to Benedict 
Arnold's descent on New London and the Massacre at Fort Griswold. 
It is a book to appeal to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary 
scenes, while the love story which is interwoven will be found a singu- 
larly charming idyl. 

A BID FOR FORTUNE. 

By GUY BOOTHBY, author of " The Marriage of Esther," etc. 

No. 179, Town and Country Library. 12mo, paper, 50 cents ; 

cloth, $1.00. 

The unexpected incidents and strange adventures which follow thick 
and fast in Mr. Boothby's stirring story maintain the interest of the 
reader at the highest point throughout. It would be unfair to sketch 
the plot of his thrilling tale, which will be welcomed as a relief from 
the novel of analysis and the discussions of marital infelicity.

THE VICTORIAN GARDEN OF SONG. 

It is always difficult to fix the limits of a 
literary period. Such terms as the Age of 
Pericles, the Augustan Age (Roman or En- 
glish), and the Elizabethan Age stand, indeed, 
for fairly definite concepts ; we recognize the 
fact that a certain unity of spirit and aspira- 
tion in the writers who made them famous jus- 
tifies their employment as counters in the game 
of literary history ; yet scientific precision of 
statement is obviously out of the question where 
they are concerned. We are reminded, some- 
how, of the decorative swirl wherewith, in Mr. 
Vedder's designs for the quatrains of Omar, 
we find symbolized the convergence of all the 
forces and influences that meet in the hour of 
our conscious existence, only to diverge once 
more from that focus, that they may enter into 
other and we know not what combinations. 
Thus it is with the Victorian Age in our liter- 
ature : we know that it has been the outcome 
of the past ; we know, likewise, that its scat- 
tered elements will enter into the spiritual syn- 
thesis of the future; but to us, whose lives 
have been shaped by its ideals, the immediate 
fact of its nearness to us is all-important, and 
the impulse to regard it as a concrete is well- 
nigh irresistible. 

When Mr. Stedman published his " Victo- 
rian Poets," in 1875, he brought abundant and 
convincing logic to the support of the faith 
that was in us of the belief that we were near- 
ing the close of a literary epoch as well-marked 
and as distinctly characterized as any that had 
preceded it in our history. Now, at a date 
twenty years removed, the same skilful hand 
gives us a " Victorian Anthology " which con- 
firms the earlier impression, and leaves us with 
a deepened sense of the richness in poetical 
material and inspiration of the period in which 
our fortunate lot has been cast. That the end 
has been now reached is by no means certain, 
and the transition to the poetry of the coming 
century will, no doubt, be made easy by many 
connecting links of melodious utterance, just 
as the poetry of Wordsworth and Landor did 
much to save from abruptness the passage 
from the glorious period of Shelley, Keats, 



238 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



and Coleridge, to the no less glorious period 
of Tennyson, Browning, and Mr. Swinburne. 
Yet the signs of a closing epoch are, on the 
whole, clearer in 1895 than they were twenty 
years ago, and Mr. Stedman's prognostica- 
tion has not been flouted by the emergence of 
any new and distinctive poetical force. It was 
made at a time when six great poets of English 
speech wore the laurel upon living brows ; 
since it was made, four of the six have gone 
" where Orpheus and where Homer are," and 
no new altar-fires have sprung up to dim the 
light of the two singers who still happily re- 
main with us. We cannot, in the nature of 
things, hope for an extension of the Victorian 
name far over the years to come, and no twen- 
tieth century compiler of a Victorian anthol- 
ogy will be likely much to exceed the scope of 
Mr. Stedman's collection. 

The octogenarian of to-day whose years have 
run parallel with those of England's Queen, 
and who has been all his life a lover of poetry, 
has had many things for which to be thankful, 
many sensations of the rarer and more exqui- 
site sort. To such a person, coming to man- 
hood, let us say, in the very year of the Queen's 
accession, the deaths of Shelley and Keats were 
but childish memories, while the deaths of Scott 
and Coleridge doubtless seemed to ring the 
knell of creative poetry. Yet he may have 
been old enough to be captivated by the first 
poems of Tennyson, and to detect in them the 
new note which even then set the key in which 
the swelling harmonies of the coming age were 
destined to be scored. Possibly, also, he may 
have strayed, at the verge of manhood, upon 
" Pauline " and " Paracelsus," and wondered at 
their strange cadences and virile strength. His 
first genuine sensation, however, must have 
been delayed until 1842, when the possibilities 
of Tennyson's genius were first fully revealed. 
The middle of the century found our lover of 
song in possession of " The Princess " and " In 
Memoriam," and of a series of Browning vol- 
umes numerous and distinctive enough to put 
beyond question the fact that this poet also 
must be reckoned with. If, moreover, he had 
lent an attentive ear to the new voices about 
him, he could not have failed to be impressed 
by the quality of a thin volume, published in 
1848, and entitled The Strayed Keveller and 
Other Poems." At least, the appearance of 
" Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems," in 
1853, must have made it clear that a third great 
poet had arisen in Victorian England. The 
year 1855, when the subject of our imaginary 



biography had just turned the forties, must still 
be remembered by him as an annus mirdbilis, 
for it brought the " Poems " of Arnold, Ten- 
nyson's " Maud," and the " Men and Women " 
of Browning. 

Some ten years were to elapse before another 
sensation of the first class was possible. The 
first series of Mr. Swinburne's " Poems and 
Ballads " appeared in 1866, and even our hypo- 
thetical octogenarian, who then had a half cen- 
tury to his credit, would probably subscribe to 
the opinion of Mr. Saintsbury (a much younger 
man), when he says : " I do not suppose that 
anybody now alive (I speak of lovers of poetry) 
who was not alive in 1832 and old enough then 
to enjoy the first perfect work of Tennyson, 
has had such a sensation as that which was ex- 
perienced in the autumn of 1866 by readers of 
Mr. Swinburne's ' Poems and Ballads.' And 
I am sure that no one in England has had any 
such sensation since." Our reader may, how- 
ever, have been in a measure prepared for the 
experience by getting hold of the " Atalanta " 
in 1864, of the " Chastelard " in 1865, and 
even of " The Queen Mother " and " Rosa- 
mond " in 1861. He may also have recognized 
the possibilities of still another poet, who put 
forth " The Defence of Guenevere " as early as 
1858. At all events, he can have had no doubt 
of the appearance of a fifth great Victorian poet 
when the year 1867 brought " The Life and 
Death of Jason," and the following year the 
beginnings of " The Earthly Paradise." En- 
gland might now proudly boast of five great 
poets among the living ; would there be a sixth ? 
The question was soon answered. It was in 
1870 that the friends of Rossetti persuaded 
him to exhume the manuscript collection of 
verse that had, in a passion of unassuageable 
grief, been consigned to the grave with the 
body of his wife, and to give it to the world. 
The publication of this volume gave to our lover 
of poetry the last distinctive sensation that he 
was to know. The quarter-century that has 
elapsed since 1870 has brought him no exper- 
ience comparable with this, and his pleasures 
have been limited to the retrospective enjoy- 
ment of a rich past, and delight in the later 
productions of the six great poets whose fame 
was so long ago so surely established. 

Mr. Stedman's " Victorian Anthology " fills 
six hundred and seventy-six compact double- 
columned pages, eighty-seven of which are de- 
voted to the six Victorian master singers. No 
other poets are illustrated at similar length, 
with the exception of Landor, who stands in 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



239 



the forefront of the epoch, and, more than any 
other poet, serves to link it with the age of 
Shelley. Examples are given us of no less 
than three hundred and forty-three poets, 
thirty-six of whom belong to Australasia and 
Canada. The three hundred and seven En- 
glish (as distinguished from Colonial) poets 
are grouped in three great divisions, corre- 
sponding to the beginning, the middle, and 
the close of the reign. In each of these divi- 
sions, subdivisions are formed, and the fine 
critical sense of the editor is displayed in the 
felicitous names that he has given to these 
lesser groups. Nothing could be happier, for 
example, than to classify Barham, Maginn, 
and Mahony as "The Roisterers"; Barnes, 
Waugh, and Laycock under the style of " The 
Oaten Flute," or Locker-Lampson, Calverley, 
and Sir Frederick Pollock as writers of " Ele- 
gantiae." This carefully-considered classifica- 
tion is in itself a great help to the student, 
and often suggests affinities that would other- 
wise be likely to escape his notice. Nothing 
is lacking to make this great anthology all 
that could be desired. Besides the features 
of the work that have already been mentioned, 
there is such an introductory essay as Mr. 
Stedman alone could write, a section devoted 
to biographical notes, and indexes of first lines, 
titles, and poets. By way of adornment, to 
say nothing of such unfailingly tasteful me- 
chanical features as we have learned to expect 
from Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Company, 
the book has two appropriate illustrations in 
photogravure the "Poet's Corner" in the 
Abbey where so many of England's poets lie 
buried, and the Queen whose name will always 
be as firmly associated with that of Tennyson 
as the name of Elizabeth is associated with 
that of Shakespeare. No less noticeable than 
the fine critical taste displayed by Mr. Sted- 
man in making his selections is the conscien- 
tiousness which has gone into every detail of 
his work. It would be difficult to imagine a 
better-made anthology, or one more likely to 
take a permanent place among standard works 
of reference. It belongs to the small class 
which includes Mr. Humphry Ward's " En- 
glish Poets " and Professor Palgrave's " Golden 
Treasury," and hardly any other collections of 
English verse. We may well be proud as a 
nation that such a work for English poetry 
should have been left for an American to per- 
form. The book is one that will prove simply 
indispensable to students of poetry and culti- 
vated readers alike. 



THE REAL AND THE IDEAL. 
A HINT FROM NATURE. 



To Walter Pater's question, " Is poetry, the lit- 
erary beauty, the poetical ideal, always but a bor- 
rowed light upon man's actual life?" I think an 
affirmative answer must be given. The poetry is 
from within ; it is the light that never was upon sea 
or land ; and this light is upon the past more than 
upon the present. The present moment is always 
prosy and commonplace. The grandeur and sig- 
nificance of our own day are very apt to be hidden 
from us. Hence to wed poetry and modernity is 
always a difficult task. It is easier to charm us with 
the imaginary than with the real. I think un- 
doubtedly Hawthorne had an easier task than has 
Mr. Howells, Balzac than Zola. The latter is some- 
times overpowered and hampered by the reality 
as in " Lourdes." 

All true art is interpretative. The great realist, 
like Tolstoi, interprets life. If he were merely to 
copy it, we should tire even of him. To interpret 
it is not to improve upon it ; it is to draw it out, set 
it off, and make us see it through a new medium 
and as a whole. The true historian interprets his- 
tory, shows us what probably the actors themselves 
did not know. The value of any writer's or artist's 
interpretation of life is in proportion as it is vivid 
and large and true. Did not Carlyle interpret 
Cromwell to his countrymen? In art, facts are to 
be digested, made fluid, and informed with life. 
In science, they are to be left as facts. If I go out 
and name every bird I see, and describe its color 
and ways give a lot of facts about the bird my 
reader is not interested. But if I relate the bird 
in some way to human life, to my own life, show 
what it is to me and what it is in the landscape or 
the season, speak of it in terms of general human 
experience, then is the reader interested. Only so 
do I give him a live bird. To cast an air of ro- 
mance, of adventure, of the new and untried, over 
common facts and common life to infuse the ideal 
into the real that is the secret. 

The best analogy I know of in Nature of the re- 
lation of the artist to his environment is furnished 
by the honey-bee. The bee is both realist and ideal- 
ist. Her product reflects her environment, and it 
reflects that which her environment knows not of. 
Most persons think the bee gets her honey from the 
flowers. But she does not ; honey is the product 
of the bee it is the nectar of the flower with the 
bee added. What the bee gets from the flower is 
sweet water; this she brings home in her honey 
bag : she meditates upon it as it were ; she puts it 
through a process of her own ; she reduces the wa- 
ter and adds a minute drop of formic acid, secreted 
by her own body. It is this minute drop which 
gives honey its delicious sting, like the works of 
genius, and makes it differ from all other sweets in 
the world. 

Nothing is better, nothing is more indispensable

in a novel or other imaginative work, than local 
color, local flavor, the atmosphere of the time and 
place ; but these things must all have been supple- 
mented, and in a measure changed, by the genius 
of the artist. We shall detect New York, or New 
England, or California, or the South, in his work, 
only as we detect the local flora in the product of 
the bee. The honey of Hymettus is not like that 
of Pentelicon ; the honey of California is not like that 
of Michigan or Florida, yet all kinds agree in being 
honey and not merely nectar. You can taste the 
flowers in each one of them the clover, the orange 
blossom, the thyme, the linden, the sumac ; but to 
the nectar of each the bee has imparted her own 
peculiar and transforming quality. 

A recent London writer argues against realism 
in fiction, because, he says, " In human life there 
are no facts. . . . Life is in the eye of the observer. 
The humor or the pity of it belongs entirely to the 
spectator, and depends upon the gift of vision he 
brings." Still there are facts in life facts of race, 
of country, of time, of conditions ; and the work 
of the true realist reflects them. New England life, 
old England life, life in Texas or Iowa or Massa- 
chusetts, here are facts that must modify the work 
of the novelist who finds the materials of his story 
in any of these countries. 

One might as well say there are no facts in Na- 
ture no facts anywhere. True, all depends upon 
the eye that sees, upon its interpretative power; 
but the facts the types, the conditions must be 
there to start with. We do not want a barren real- 
ism, as I suspect we sometimes get in Zola ; we do 
not want merely the raw sweet water of the facts : 
we want soul and personality added ; we want the 
amber liquid with the delicious sting in which the 
nectar of fact has been transmuted into something 
higher and finer. I suspect that all Mr. Garland 
really demands in that suggestive little volume of 
his called " Crumbling Idols " is that Western bees 
shall make honey from Western flowers though he 
may err a little in thinking this honey will be better 

than any ever made before. .

MONA LISA. 

What had this woman felt and seen and known, 
Ere, Lionardo, she was snatch't by thee 
From our gross precincts of mortality 
To that serene and un transcended zone 
Where the fair arts abide! Lo, years have flown, 
And new lands have been born beyond the sea; 
But she remains from perturbation free, 
This woman that hath made all life her own! 

O glorious face! triumphant over time 

And chance and change and ignorance and woe, 

What was the secret talisman sublime 

That bore thee up against the common foe, 

That let thee smile at Death, and, in thy prime, 

Look back on youth as on a toy let go ?

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE DECADENT " THOMSON." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Since reading THE DIAL of October 1, I have been 
racking my brains for a satisfactory estimate of " Thom- 
son," the decadent scholar; but with no adequate results. 
One feels a slight uncertainty whether his biographer 
really intends him to be taken seriously. There is an 
indescribable air about the story which is not inconsist- 
ent with the theory that the writer holds a " retainer " 
from that commanding portion of the American public 
which is represented as in deadly hostility to the " un- 
bias " (here my dictionary is left behind) of the Ger- 
man university. 

But granted that he wishes " Thomson " to be taken 
seriously: is the fate of the latter, after all, of such a 
nature as to claim any large amount of our sympathy, 
at a time when the Cubans and Armenians and Vene- 
zuelans have so nearly exhausted that emotion in the 
American breast ? One might easily lash himself into 
indignation, like Homer's lion, at the thought of such a 
genius as " Thomson," compelled, in a college " narrow 
and closely sectarian," to teach Presbyterian Physics, or 
the Baptist theory of Taxation, or Methodist Chemistry, 
or any of the other well-known requirements of our 
sectarian schools ; but the troublesome question will 
come to the front, Did not Thomson fall too easily ? 
Since when has it been absolutely necessary to the in- 
tegrity of a great man's devotion to Truth that he be 
furnished with a good professorship, a regular salary, 
and an ample supply of " elbow-room " ? Why should 
a few years of unappreciated endeavor have made the 
descent into the Avernian regions of learned decadence 
so easy ? Why was the brain of this all too faithless 
devotee to truth fired by no prophetic vision of 

" Seven cities claiming 1 Thomson dead, 

Through which the living Thomson begged his bread ? " 
No, men of " Thomson's " fibre will not do. In mak- 
ing up the army of reformers which is to bring light 
where " ignorance and all uncharitableness " have been, 
all such as he must be firmly rejected if the recruiting 
officers are to do their duty. We want no one in the 
ranks who is liable to desert when supplies run short. 

But, as I said at the start, I am not clear in my own 
conceptions as to " Thomson," and I do not want to go 
so far as to accuse him of personal moral turpitude. 
I surrender him to the psychiatrist, who may detect 
some lesion of the brain ; or to the student of heredity, 
who may find that the seeds of his decadence were 
born in him. In taking leave of him, my mind is in- 
clined to settle down into an attitude of thankfulness 
that he was not elevated to any really important edu- 
cational position before his inevitable tendency to de- 
cadence was made manifest. \y t jj f JOHNSON. 



A CARD FROM ''THOMSON'S" BIOGRAPHER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg leave seriously to assure W. R. K. and " a con- 
siderable class of your readers and contributors " that 
the alarming inferences in W. R. K.'s letter (DiAL, Oct. 
16) are not, I am relieved to say, based upon a sound 
deduction, or upon data which could warrant an induc- 
tion. The feverishness of Thomson's ambition and the 
low tone of his opportunity were purposely exaggerated 
to bring out the conflict necessary to such a bit of fiction.

Just now there seem to be indications that 
the waning " Napoleonic revival " is going to 
be followed, in this country at least, by a whole- 
some corrective in the shape of a Lincoln re- 
vival. Hero-worship is harmless and even prof- 
itable, if only the object of one's cult be wisely 
chosen. Napoleon Bonaparte was as unques- 
tionably the hero of his epoch, as Satan is the 
hero of Milton's poem ; and it is pretty diffi- 
cult to settle the balance of iniquity between 
them. But Abraham Lincoln was a hero of 
another type. The painters of great men, from 
Plutarch down, have shown us none worthier 
the esteem of a democratic age than the homely 
figure whose progress, chiefly through the force 
of high personal qualities, from the settler's 
cabin to the White House, may well strengthen 
the faith of those who believe that " govern- 
ment of the people, by the people, and for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth." 

None of the volumes before us is or pre- 
tends to be very critical, or at all exhaustive. 
Loosely coherent collections, mainly, of per- 
sonal reminiscences, they call for little in the 
way of general comment, and may best be 
allowed, so far as possible, to speak for them- 
selves. 

Mr. Noah Brooks's " Washington in Lin- 
coln's Time " is a graphic, if rather fragment- 
ary, volume of pen-sketches of war-time scenes 
and celebrities, interesting mainly for what the 
author tells us of Mr. Lincoln, whom he saw 
often and knew intimately. Mr. Brooks went 
to Washington in 1862 as a newspaper cor- 
respondent, and remained there up to John- 
son's administration ; and he now gives us the 
pith of what he observed and wrote during that 
time. His pictures of the then chaotic condi- 
tion of the federal capital are fresh and full of 
interest. At once the seat of government and 
an armed camp on the fringe of battle, con- 
stantly menaced by the enemy and the prey of 
countless alarms and flying rumors, Washing-

ton was the focus where all that was peculiar 
to the times seemed to gather and concentrate. 
There, as perhaps nowhere else in the North, 
home-keeping citizens realized the war, its ex- 
citements, anxieties, and horrors. For months 
the flag of the Union floating over the Capitol 
had been challenged by the stars and bars vis- 
ible on the other side of the Potomac; and 
later in the war Early brought the defiant 
colors once more within view from the city 
walls. Scenes of pathos and pity were not 
wanting. After the great battles that were 
fought near at hand, like Fredericksburg and 
Chancellorsville, the way to Washington be- 
came a via dolorosa, along which streamed the 
dejected tide of fugitives returning from the 
front. Says Mr. Brooks : 

" They arrived in squads of a hundred or more, ban- 
daged and limping, ragged and dishevelled, blackened 
with smoke and powder, and drooping with weakness. 
They came groping and faltering, so faint and so long- 
ing for rest that one's heart bled at the piteous sight. 
Here and there were men left to make their way as 
best they could to the hospitals, and who were leaning 
on the iron railings or sitting wearily on the curbstones; 
but it was noticeable that all maintained the genuine 
American pluck in the midst of their suffering." 

Hardly less moving than the plight of these 
directer victims of war was that of the anx- 
ious-faced strangers from the North who flocked 
to the city close upon the tidings of the great 
battles, in quest of friends or of news of friends 
who had been at the front. It was easy, says 
the author, " to recognize them by their dis- 
tressed faces, their strangeness in the city, and 
their inquiries for hospitals or for the shortest 
routes to scenes made celebrated by some life- 
destroying fight." Close to the seat of war, the 
capital became a city of hospitals, one of the 
most unique of which was that improvised in 
the Patent Office museum. The author gives 
an amusing story of a visit he once made to 
this place with Mr. Lincoln. In making the 
round of the cots they paused beside a badly- 
wounded soldier who was apparently nearing 
the end of his pilgrimage, and to whom a be- 
nevolent lady had just then thoughtfully pre- 
sented a tract. 

" After she had gone, the patient picked up with lan- 
guid hand the leaflet dropped upon his cot, and, glanc- 
ing at the title, began to laugh. When we reached him, 
the President said: 'My good fellow, the lady doubt- 
less means well, and it is hardly fair for you to laugh 
at her gift.' ' Well, Mr. President,' said the soldier, 
how can I help laughing a little ? She has given me 
a tract on the " Sin of Dancing," and both of my legs 
are shot off.' " 

Mr. Lincoln had a great relish for the rough

wit of the soldiers, and met it cordially enough, 
as in the following encounter with a profane 
mule-driver, whose unusually picturesque oaths 
had attracted his attention : 

" Finally Mr. Lincoln, leaning forward, touched the 
man on the shoulder, and said : ' Excuse me, my friend, 
are you an Episcopalian ? ' The man, greatly startled, 
looked round and replied : ' No, Mr. President ; I am 
a Methodist.' ' Well,' said Lincoln, < I thought you 
must be an Episcopalian, because you swear just like 
Governor Seward, who is a church-warden.' The driver 



swore no more. 



Besides his Washington pictures, and stories 
illustrative of Mr. Lincoln's private life and 
character, Mr. Brooks gives a brief account of 
two war-time National Conventions the one 
at Baltimore, which renominated Lincoln, and 
that at Chicago, which nominated McClellan. 
There is a good deal of interspersed political 
comment and gossip ; and while some of Mr. 
Brooks's stories strike us as being old acquaint- 
ances, the book is entertaining on the whole, 
and repays reading. 

A well-edited and fairly continuous little 
volume of Lincoln reminiscences is " Recol- 
lections of Abraham Lincoln" (1847-65), 
compiled from various letters, memoranda, and 
published articles of Mr. Ward Hill Lamon, 
by his daughter, Miss Dorothy Lamon. As 
Mr. Lamon published, many years ago, a biog- 
raphy of Lincoln, it is presumed that these are 
additional reminiscences, found among his pa- 
pers. We need scarcely say that Mr. Lamon 
was a competent witness in the premises. He 
was for years Mr. Lincoln's law partner and 
confidential friend ; and when Mr. Lincoln 
went to Washington for his inauguration in 
1861 he accompanied him, pursuant to the 
following characteristic summons : 

" Hill, on the llth I go to Washington, and I want 
you to go along with me. Our friends have already 
asked me to send you as Consul to Paris. You know 
I would cheerfully give you anything for which our 
friends may ask or which you may desire, but it looks 
as if we might have war. In that case I want you with 
me. In fact I must have you. So get yourself ready 
and come along. It will be handy to have you around. 
If there is to be a fight, I want you to help me do my 
share of it, as you have done in times past." 

There was no beating about the diplomatic 
bush then, nor was there a month or so later, 
when Mr. Lamon was sent on a pacificatory 
mission to Governor Pickens of South Caro- 
lina. Secretary Seward opposed the mission 
which certainly looked risky enough for Mr. 
Lamon, in view of the then disposition of the 
Carolinians towards " Lincoln hirelings." The 
President, however, at once clinched the matter : 



" Mr. Secretary, I have known Lamon to be in many 
a close place, and he has never been in one that he didn't 
get out of. By Jing ! I '11 risk him. Go, Lamon, and 
God bless you ! Bring back a Palmetto branch, if you 
can't bring us good news." 

Mr. Lamon went ; and it is needless to say 
that it was the palmetto, and not an olive 
branch, that he brought back from Charleston. 
As we have said, the editor of this volume 
has succeeded in reducing her material to a 
fairly continuous narrative. It opens with an 
interesting chapter on Mr. Lamon's early asso- 
ciation with Mr. Lincoln, first at Danville, 
then at Bloomington, and on the circuit ; and 
thence passes on to the journey from Spring- 
field to Washington, the inauguration, and so 
on through the two administrations down to 
the assassination, at which time the Marshal 
was journeying to Richmond on probably the 
last passport ever issued by Mr. Lincoln. On 
the eve of his departure Mr. Lamon, scenting 
danger, urged the President, in the presence of 
Secretary Usher, to go out as little as possible 
after nightfall, and on no account to go to the 
theatre. Turning to Mr. Usher, Mr. Lincoln 
said: 

" Usher, this boy is a monomaniac on the subject of 
my safety. I can hear him, or hear of his being around, 
at all hours of the night, to prevent somebody from 
murdering me. He thinks I shall be killed; and we 
think he is going crazy. What does anyone want to 
assassinate me for ? If any one wants to do so, he can 
do it any day or night, if he is ready to give his life for 
mine. It is nonsense." 

Three nights later the speaker was shot, at pre- 
cisely the place against which he had been 
warned by his Marshal. 

Like many men of strictly practical training, 
Mr. Lincoln had a strain of superstition in his 
nature that contrasted oddly with his common 
views and practice. The very genius of strong 
sense and plain dealing in everyday matters, 
he set great store by dreams and omens, and 
seems to have long had a presentiment of his 
coming fate that amounted to certainty. A 
singular incident that greatly affected him oc- 
curred just after his election in 1860. 

" It was the double image of himself in a looking- 
glass, which he saw while lying on a lounge in his own 
chamber at Springfield. There was Abraham Lincoln's 
face reflecting the full glow of health and hopeful life ; 
and in the same mirror, at the same moment, was the 
face of Abraham Lincoln showing a ghostly paleness. 
On trying the experiment at other times, as confirm- 
atory tests, the illusion reappeared, and then vanished 

as before. . . . To his mind the illusion was a sign, 

the life-like image betokening a safe passage through 
his first term as President ; the ghostly one, that death 
would overtake him before the close of the second."

The most startling incident of the kind was a 
dream Mr. Lincoln had just before his assassi- 
nation ; and however we may interpret the 
phenomenon as related to its sequel, the coin- 
cidence was certainly striking enough. De- 
scribing his dream to his wife, who had noted 
his disturbed appearance, Mr, Lincoln con- 
cluded : 

"... Determined to find the cause of a state of 
things so mysterious, I kept on until I arrived at the 
East Room, which I entered. There I met with a 
sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque, on 
which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. 
Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as 
guards ; and there was a throng of people, some gazing 
mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, 
others weeping pitifully. Who is dead in the White 
House ? ' I asked one of the soldiers. ' The President,' 
was his answer ; ' he was killed by an assassin.' Then 
came a loud burst of grief from the crowd, which 
awoke me from my dream. I slept no more that night ; 
and although it was only a dream, I have been strangely 
annoyed by it ever since." 

The volume contains a plentiful crop of Mr. 
Lincoln's quaint stories ; and these, Mr. La- 
mon is careful to say, were usually told with a 
definite purpose often a very serious one. 
It is pretty difficult nowadays to realize that 
Abraham Lincoln, the very soul of earnestness, 
sincerity, and public zeal, the man who per- 
haps above all others was penetrated with a 
realizing sense of the tragedy of his time and 
wrung by the spectacle of its blood and tears, 
was once freely denounced from press and 
platform as a vulgar jester, a " buffoon," who, 
while driving over the corpse-strewn field of 
Antietam, was heartless enough to call on a 
companion for a comic song. The Antietam 
story ran the rounds of the press, and " was 
repeated in the New York * World ' almost 
daily for three months." Marshal Lamon was 
the " companion " in question ; and he devotes 
a chapter to clearing up the charge which 
was, of course, only a newspaper " yarn " of 
rather more than the usual degree of mendac- 
ity. Mr. Lincoln himself used to style his 
stories ' labor-saving contrivances "; which was 
a fair way of putting it. When he wished to 
light up a principle, or expose a fallacy, or re- 
duce the proposals of a long-winded meddler 
to absurdity, all in the shortest possible order, 
he simply told a story in point, to the great 
saving of his own time and the nation's. The 
office-seeker was truly Mr. Lincoln's bete-noire. 
While the fate of the country was trembling in 
the balance, he was constantly being called on 
to solve some squabble over patronage, to put 
good men in office, while heeding at the same 



time what he called " the shrieks of locality." 
Mr. Bryce, we remember, tells how a man, 
meeting Mr. Lincoln on the streets of Wash- 
ington and noting with alarm his unusually 
worried and abstracted look, asked anxiously : 
" What is the matter, Mr. President has any- 
thing serious happened at the front ? " " No," 
replied Mr. Lincoln, wearily, " it is n't the war ; 
it 's that post-office at Brownsville, Missouri." 
Very humorous, if summary, was his disposal 
of a delegation that once called on him to solicit 
a place as commissioner to the Sandwich Islands 
for a friend whose chief stated qualification for 
the post was that he was in poor health and 
needed a balmy climate. " Gentlemen," said 
Mr. Lincoln, kindly but firmly, " I am sorry to 
say that there are eight other applicants for 
that place, and they are all sicker than your 
man." Second only to the office-seekers in vex- 
atious persistency were the well-meaning med- 
dlers who swarmed to the capital to tender 
their " views " to the President. Like sorrows, 
they came in battalions scarcely a day pass- 
ing without several delegations, loaded and 
primed for the edification or discomfiture of 
the Administration, presenting themselves at 
the White House. Some of them were com- 
mittees of clergymen, who came to offer their 
strategical views, and to propose sweeping 
changes in the conduct of the war. Mr. Lin- 
coln listened courteously to all ; and once, when 
his patience was sorely tried by the cavils of 
some reverend gentleman from the West, he 
made the following notable reply : 

"Gentlemen, suppose all the property you possess 
were in gold, and you had placed it in the hands of 
Blondin to carry across the Niagara river on a rope. 
With slow, cautious, steady step he walks the rope, 
bearing your all. Would you shake the cable, and 
keep shouting to him, Blondin ! stand up a little 
straighter ! Blondin ! stoop a little more ; go a little 
faster ; lean more to the south ! Now lean a little 
more to the north ! ' would that be your behavior in 
such an emergency ? . . . This government, gentle- 
men, is carrying an immense weight ; untold treasures 
are in its hands. The persons managing the ship of 
state in this storm are doing the best they can. Do n't 
worry them with needless warnings and complaints. 
Keep silence, be patient, and we will get you safe across. 
Good day, gentlemen. I have other duties pressing 
upon me that must be attended to." 

Miss Lamon's volume contains two portraits 
of Mr. Lincoln, one after a painting by Healy 
done in 1868, and one after a photograph of 
ten years earlier, together with several inter- 
esting documents in facsimile.

publication the first attempt, we believe, at 
a handy separately-issued volume of selections 
from Mr. Lincoln's works. All of the speeches 
are worth reading, some are worth pondering, 
and one of them, certainly, ought to be en- 
graved on the memory of every American who 
cares for his country and has faith in the 
theory and the future of popular government. 
Compared with the Gettysburg Address, half 
the " famous speeches " in the anthologies 
savor of fustian. Mr. Chittenden's book is 
small, but it is representative, and contains 
enough to convey a just idea of Mr. Lincoln's 
style and powers, as well as of his views on the 
great issues of the period. The selections 
range, in time, from 1832 to 1865 ; in quality, 
from the plain sense and homespun diction of 
his early speeches, to the condensed power and 
classic purity of the Gettysburg Address. The 
editor has furnished a brief biographical intro- 
duction, and there is a good frontispiece por- 
trait. 

It may be remembered that on the thirtieth 
anniversary of the death of Mr. Lincoln (April 
4, 1895) the publishers of the New York " In- 
dependent " issued a " Lincoln number " of 
their journal, containing some forty brief pa- 
pers on the Martyr President, by men who had 
known him, or had seen him under interesting 
conditions. This matter has since been pub- 
lished in book form, with the title " Abraham 
Lincoln, Tributes and Reminiscences from his 
Associates," and it forms an acceptable and 
informing memorial volume. The Introduc- 
tion is by Dr. Ward, editor of the "Inde- 
pendent." The papers are critical, eulogistic, 
or anecdotal, according to the bents and stand- 
points of the respective authors. Among these 
we note Mr. George S. Boutwell, Dr. Henry 
M. Field, Mr. Daniel D. Bidwell, Senator 
Dawes, Dr. Theodore Cuyler, Hon. L. E. Chit- 
tenden, General Neal Dow, Grace Greenwood, 
etc. Senator Morgan of Alabama, once a gen- 
eral in the Confederate service, pays a thought- 
ful tribute to Mr. Lincoln, finding that his most 
conspicuous virtue as Commander-in-Chief of 
the Federal forces " was the absence of a spirit 
of resentment or oppression toward the enemy, 
and the self-imposed restraint under which he 
exercised the really absolute powers within his 
grasp." It is related that President Lincoln 
once said, in his quaint way, when about to 
sign the pardon of a man condemned to be shot 
for some breach of duty, that he did n't " be- 
lieve shooting was going to do him any good." 
Nor did he believe harsh treatment was going 



to do the South any good ; and it is a common- 
place of history that the bullet of the wretched 
Booth deprived the South of its best friend, 
and put back substantial reconstruction a de- 
cade or more. We are glad to note that it is 
the serious and grandly humane, rather than 
the humorous, side of Mr. Lincoln's character 
that stands out most prominently in this vol- 
ume, which is a very acceptable addition to 
Lincoln literature. E> G> j. 



LEAVES FROM COLERIDGE'S NOTE-BOOKS.* 

Following almost immediately upon the pub- 
lication of Coleridge's Letters (reviewed in 
THE DIAL of June 1, 1895), and the renewed 
interest in the poet's personality and writings 
which that work has awakened, the appear- 
ance of the " Anima Poetse " is most timely. 
The present volume is a " collection of hitherto 
unpublished aphorisms, reflections, confessions, 
and soliloquies," made up from the note-books 
and pocket-books which Coleridge himself in- 
forms us were at times his " only confidants." 
More than fifty of these noteworthy books have 
been preserved, dating from as early as 1795 
down to the poet's death in 1834 ; and although 
occasional extracts from these copy-books had 
been published, there yet remained a vast quan- 
tity of literary material of which no use had 
been made. It is from this source that Mr. 
Ernest Hartley Coleridge, the poet's grandson, 
has brought together a volume of prose selec- 
tions, arranged as far as possible in chrono- 
logical order, and extending nearly from the 
beginning of Coleridge's literary career down 
to the summer of 1828. The note-books be- 
longing to the succeeding years (1828-34), 
the editor states, are devoted too largely to 
theological and metaphysical disquisition to be 
of any great interest to the general reader. 
Among the five or six hundred topics touched 
upon in this book, ranging in length anywhere 
from a single line to four pages, that delight- 
ful confusion of subject prevails which gives a 
work of this sort its greatest charm. One 
finds here allusions and figures, a sentence or 
a paragraph, which the poet stowed away for 
future use in some lecture, essay, or poem ; 
brief passages on the more interesting of his 
daily experiences ; estimates of the characters 
of his literary friends ; thoughts on friendship,

love, and marriage, subjects that deeply moved 
Coleridge's affectionate nature ; bits of criti- 
cism of contemporary criticism, interlarded 
with statements of more general import ; quo- 
tations from Greek, Latin, German, Italian, 
and English classics, with either critical or in- 
terpretive comment ; suggestions for unwritten 
poems, nestling in among weightier and vaster 
metaphysical observations ; the strangest of 
fancies beside the most prosaic of practical 
admonitions ; and all these thoughts and fan- 
cies crowding each other to death, as Cole- 
ridge observes was always characteristic of his 
thoughts, thrown off in his most impassioned 
moments before the glow of the poet's imagin- 
ation was cooled by the pruning care of the 
artist. The intimacy which one can have 
with one's note-book, but not at all times with 
one's friends, is felt on every page ; and it is 
this, together with that subtle fineness of the 
breath and spirit of poetry, which is not sel- 
dom lost, or at any rate changed into a fine- 
ness of a different kind that often resolves 
itself into a classic coldness when put into 
more polished forms of verse and prose, that 
gives the work its unique value. The poet is 
not posing here : 

"... What I have seen and what I have thought, 
with a little of what I have felt, in the words in which 
I told and talked them to my pocket-books, the con- 
fidants who have not betrayed me, the friends whose 
silence was not detraction, and the inmates before whom 
I was not ashamed to complain, to yearn, to weep, or 
even to pray ! " 

One may dip into the " Anima Poeta3 " 
almost at random, and come upon striking 
passages. Not a few may be found to illus- 
trate Coleridge's intercourse with his friends ; 
take as an example this afterthought in which 
he records Hazlitt's anger on the occasion of 
an animated argument and then proceeds to 
protest against Wordsworth's nature-worship : 
" A most unpleasant dispute with Wordsworth and 
Hazlitt. I spoke, I fear, too contemptuously ; but they 
spoke so irreverently, so malignantly of the Divine 
Wisdom that it overset me. Hazlitt, how easily raised 
to rage and hatred self-projected ! but who shall find 
the force that can drag him out of the depths into one 
expression of kindness, into the showing of one gleam 
of the light of love on his countenance ? Peace be with 
him ! . . . But, surely, always to look at the superficies 
of objects for the purpose of taking delight in their 
beauty, and sympathy with their real or imagined life, 
is as deleterious to the health and manhood of intellect 
as always to be peering and unravelling contrivance 
may be to the simplicity of the affection and the 
grandeur and unity of the imagination. dearest 
William ! would Roy or Durham have spoken of God 
as you spoke of Nature ? " 



Coleridge was at all times devoutly religious, 
and his faith, even when protesting against 
dogma, was pervaded by a gracious tender- 
ness. 

It was, however, as a conversationalist, or 
rather as a monologuist entirely monopolizing 
the talk, that Coleridge exerted his greatest 
influence upon the men and literature of his 
time. " No talk," says Carlyle, " in his cen- 
tury or in any other, could be more surprising," 
and though he adds that it more often speeded 
" everywhither " rather than " anywhither," 
these discourses must have possessed an inim- 
itable eloquence, flooded as they were by that 
wealth of intellectual light and drawn from 
those immense stores of information always at 
Coleridge's command. Much of this marvel- 
lous power was necessarily fleeting, and to all 
except a few it is even now become, like the 
voice and personality of a great actor who is 
of the past only, a mere tradition. But judged 
by the standards of the ordinary conversation, 
there was a certain inappropriateness about 
these talks, of which even Coleridge himself 
at odd moments was conscious, though he urges 
a nimeity of ideas, not of words : 

" There are two sorts of talkative fellows. . . . The 
first sort is of those who use five hundred words more 
than needs to express an idea that is not my case. . . . 
The second sort is of those who use five hundred more 
ideas, images, reasons, etc., than there is any need of 
to arrive at their object, till the only object arrived at 
is that the mind's eye of the bystander is dazzled with 
colors succeeding so rapidly as to leave one vague im- 
pression that there has been a great blaze of colors all 
about something. Now this is my case, and a grievous 
fault it is. My illustrations swallow up my thesis. I 
feel too intensely the omni-presence of all in each, pla- 
tonically speaking; or, psychologically, my brain-fibres, 
or the spiritual light which abides in the brain-marrow, 
as visible light appears to do in sundry rotten mackerel 
and other smashy matters, is of too general an affinity 
with all things, and though it perceives the difference 
of things, yet is eternally pursuing the likenesses, or, 
rather, that which is common [between them]." 

He elsewhere in less serious vein hints that 
his conversation was not always adapted to his 
listeners : 

"Coleridge! Coleridge! will you never learn to ap- 
propriate your conversation to your company ! Is it not 
desecration, indelicacy, and a proof of great weakness 
and even vanity, to talk to, etc., etc., as if you [were 
talking to] Wordsworth or Sir G. Beaumont ? " 

Another noteworthy feature of the book is 
the descriptive portion. Coleridge was not the 
close observer of nature that Wordsworth was, 
yet that association with the latter brought the 
former into a closer communion with nature is 
no more to be doubted than that the imagina-

tion of Coleridge had, in turn, just as percepti- 
ble an effect upon the poetry of Wordsworth. 
On the whole, it was the right side of nature 
of which the poet was fondest, the grander and 
sublimer rather than the simpler things of na- 
ture ; but here, on the other hand, are two 
descriptive sentences quite in Wordsworth's 
own manner: 

" The beards of thistle and dandelions flying about 
the lonely mountain like life, and I saw them through 
the trees skimming the lake like swallows." 

" The old stump of the tree, with briar-roses and 
bramble leaves wreathed round and round a bramble 
arch a foxglove in the centre." 

The Wordsworthian will at once compare the 
former of these with those lines in the poem 
" On the Naming of Point Rash-Judgment ": 

" And, in our vacant mood 
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft 
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard 
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake." 

Add to these passages one on the voice of 
winter : 

" Now the breeze through the stiff and brittle-becom- 
ing foliage of the trees counterfeits the sound of a rush- 
ing stream or water-flood suddenly sweeping by. The 
sigh, the modulated continuousness of the murmur, is 
exchanged for the confusion of overtaking sounds 
the self-evolution of the One for the clash or stroke of 
ever-commencing contact of the multitudinous, with- 
out interspace, by confusion. The short gusts rustle, 
and the ear feels the unlithesome dryness before the 
eye detects the coarser, duller, though deeper green, 
deadened and not [yet] awakened into the hues of de- 
cay echoes of spring from the sepulchral vault of win- 
ter. The aged year, conversant with the forms of its 
youth and forgetting all the intervals, feebly repro-* 
duces them, [as it were, from] memory." 

It is too ambitious to hope for the " Anhna 
Poetffi " any such popularity as that accorded 
to the " Table Talk," which in some particu- 
lars it closely resembles ; but the book is justly 
entitled to a place among Coleridge's works, 
for it is here, above all, as its editor suggests, 
that the reader will be enabled " to form some 
estimate of those strange self-communings to 
which Coleridge devoted so much of his intel- 
lectual energies, and by means of which he 
hoped to pass through the mists and shadows 
of words and thoughts to a steadier contempla- 
tion, to the apprehension if not the compre- 
hension, of the mysteries of Truth and Being." 
The student of Coleridge will thus, perhaps, be 
enabled to see the poet from a slightly differ- 
ent point of view than has hitherto been pos- 
sible, and to the general reader the book will 
afford occasional journeys full of pleasantness. 

Mr. Coleridge has provided the volume with 
an introduction, notes where necessary, and 



very full indexes, which are absolutely essen- 
tial in a work of this character. The work is, 
moreover, issued in a style uniform with the 
recent edition of the Letters, and the three vol- 
umes taken together make a valuable addition 
to Coleridgean literature.

THE PROGRESS OF GLACIAL GEOLOGY.* 

The progress of glacial geology has been so 
great since the publication of the earlier edi- 
tions of Professor Geikie's "The Great Ice 
Age " that in the revision it has been found 
necessary to rewrite most of the volume. Even 
those parts which are not wholly rewritten are 
so modified that they read as if now written 
for the first time. Apart from the alterations 
which the studies of recent years have made 
necessary, the general scope of the volume has 
been enlarged and somewhat changed. Many 
of the minor changes in the volume are of much 
interest to geologists. While these need not be 
here detailed, they are of general interest be- 
cause they furnish unmistakable proof that 
European and American interpretations of the 
phenomena of the glacial period are steadily 
approaching each other. 

The parts of the volume which will prove to 
be of most interest outside of geological circles 
are those which deal with the question of the 
recurrence of glacial epochs, the cause of the 
glacial period, and the existence of man dring 
the glacial period. According to the author, 
the sequence of events during the glacial period 
of Europe is as follows : (1) A glacial epoch, 
preceded by a period of increasing cold. At 
this time the ice filled the basin of the Baltic. 
The Alpine lands were swathed in snow and 
ice, and great glaciers came out from the moun- 
tains, making moraines on the low ground at 
their bases. The mountain regions of Britain 
were probably ice-clad, though of this there is 
no direct evidence. In France there were gla- 
ciers from the volcanic cones of Auvergne and 
Cantal, which descended so as to deploy upon 
the plateaus. (2) Then followed the first in- 
terglacial epoch. The southern part of the 
North Sea became land, and a temperate flora, 
comparable to that of England to-day, covered 
corresponding latitudes. A luxuriant decidu- 
ous flora occupied the valleys of the Alps, and

vised Edition. New York : D. Appleton & Co.

flourished at heights which it no longer reaches. 
(3) The first interglacial epoch was succeeded 
by a second glacial epoch. During this time 
the northern mer de glace reached its greatest 
extent. At the same time, the Alpine glaciers 
reached their greatest development ; while in 
the other mountains of Europe, snow fields and 
glaciers came into being. (4) The dissolution 
of this ice sheet was followed by a second inter- 
glacial epoch. The climate of Northern and 
Central Europe again became temperate, a tem- 
perate flora and fauna replacing the arctic 
forms which first occupied the land after the 
ice disappeared. The plants which occupied 
Germany and the central plains of Russia at 
this time indicate a climate less extreme than 
that which now affects these regions. Toward 
the close of this epoch the climate became more 
rigorous. The amount of river erosion accom- 
plished during this second interglacial interval 
was such as to testify to its great duration. 
(5) The diminution in temperature noted above 
culminated in the third glacial epoch, during 
which the development of ice was less exten- 
sive than in the second. The ice sheet of this 
epoch overwhelmed a large part of the British 
Islands, and spread itself widely upon the con- 
tinent. As in the preceding epoch, the Scan- 
dinavian and British ice sheets were confluent. 
From the Alps great glaciers descended to the 
lowlands. (6) Eventually the ice of the third 
epoch disappeared, and temperate conditions 
succeeded. Of this change, the best evidence 
is furnished by the younger interglacial beds 
of the Baltic coast-lands. (7) The fourth gla- 
cial epoch succeeded the third interglacial. 
During this epoch the Lowlands of Scotland 
were submerged to a depth of a hundred feet. 
The Highlands of Scotland had their glaciers, 
which in places reached the sea. The Alpine 
glaciers flowed for long distances down the 
great valleys, but fell far short of the dimen- 
sions reached by those of the earlier epochs. 
From Scandinavia, the ice moved out, filling 
the Baltic sea, and extending south to the Bal- 
tic ridge of northern Germany. (8) Follow- 
ing the fourth glacial epoch there was a fourth 
interglacial epoch, when deciduous trees spread 
far north into regions where their congeners no 
longer flourish. At this time the Baltic was 
converted into a great lake. Submergence fol- 
lowed, and the Baltic became an arm of the 
sea, with a fauna indicative of a climate warmer 
than the present. (9) Climate conditions again 
became more severe, resulting in the fifth gla- 
cial epoch. During this epoch there were local 



valley glaciers in the British Isles, the position 
of which shows that the snow-line in Scotland 
had an average height of 2500 feet. At this 
time, Scotland was about fifty feet lower than 
now. In the Alps, the fifth glacial epoch is 
recorded in the moraines of the second so-called 
" post-glacial " stage. (10) The fifth intergla- 
cial epoch was marked by the reemergence of 
the land, and the retreat of the valley glaciers. 
Britain's area became wider than at present, 
but it is not known that connection was made 
with the continent. (11) During the sixth 
glacial epoch, Scotland was submerged twenty 
or thirty feet more than at present. The snow- 
line then stood at an elevation of something like 
3500 feet in Scotland, and a few small glaciers 
existed in the more lofty mountains. 

Several maps are given, showing the extent 
of the ice during the second, third, and fourth 
glacial epochs. During the second the ice 
reached its greatest extension. At this time, 
Ireland and Scotland and Wales were com- 
pletely covered by the glacier ice, which reached 
essentially to the valley of the Thames in En- 
gland. The ice of Britain and Ireland was con- 
fluent with that of the continent. On the con- 
tinent the ice covered all of Holland, part of 
Belgium, all the lowlands of Germany, and a 
large part of Russia. It reached its most south- 
ern extension in the valley of the Dnieper, 
somewhat below latitude 50. 

Much of the evidence on which the distinct- 
ness of so many glacial epochs is based is some- 
what technical. Without discussing the evi- 
dence, the conclusions reached by its perusal 
may be stated. There would seem to be no 
question as to the distinctness of the two epochs 
which are designated as first and second gla- 
cial. The only question which could arise in 
this connection is concerning the glacial char- 
acter of the deposits which are referred to the 
first epoch. In favor of their reference to a 
glacial epoch, Professor Geikie seems to make 
a strong case. Between the deposits of the 
second and third glacial epochs, the " lower " 
and " upper " bowlder clays of England, there 
is a well-marked interglacial horizon. This ho- 
rizon represents an interval during which the 
land surface of England was free from ice, and 
very considerably elevated. During the eleva- 
tion, the climate changed from arctic to tem- 
perate, and the land surface became clothed 
with vegetation. Following this condition of 
elevation, and of climatic amelioration, there 
was a submergence of European lands to a lim- 
ited extent, during which, or accompanying 



248

which, the climate changed from cold temper- 
ate to warm temperate, and then to arctic. The 
arctic conditions finally brought on the second 
great ice sheet. Thus, a very considerable in- 
terval of time intervened between the " lower " 
drift of Britain and the " upper," and during 
this interval northern Europe experienced pro- 
found changes of climate and its lands suffered 
considerable changes of level. It is just such 
events as these, and especially the association 
of such events, which serve to differentiate 
epochs in geological chronology. The conclu- 
sions to which the evidence drawn from Great 
Britain leads are found to be as true for the 
continent as for the island, and to be based on 
an almost identical series of facts. 

So far as Britain is concerned, the evidence 
on which the third glacial epoch is separated 
from the fourth seems to be much less conclu- 
sive. The evidence for the separation of the 
corresponding formations on the continent is 
stronger. On the continent, the third glacial 
epoch was separated from the fourth by a very 
considerable interval of time, during which the 
ice disappeared entirely from Germany, though 
it may have lingered in the Scandinavian moun- 
tains. Like its predecessor, this interglacial 
interval is marked by old soils and peat bogs 
now occupying the horizon between the depos- 
its of the preceding and succeeding ice sheets. 
It is in these soils and peat bogs that remains 
of plants are found, which tell of temperate 
climate. The interglacial horizon is also marked 
by marine and fresh-water deposits, which were 
made after the deposition of the drift of the 
preceding ice sheet, and before the develop- 
ment of the next. The position of these beds 
shows that considerable changes of level took 
place during this interglacial interval, while 
their fossils indicate the non-glacial condition 
of the region at the time they were deposited. 
There is reason to believe that this interglacial 
interval was long, not only because the changes 
in climate and in the altitude of the land de- 
mand such a conclusion, but because there is 
specific evidence that the amount of river 
erosion accomplished after the preceding and 
before the following glaciation was great. 

The evidence of three glacial epochs in north- 
ern Europe is not limited to the two lines noted 
above. The several sheets of 'drift, the sec- 
ond of which overlies the first, and the third of 
which overlies the second, are different in phy- 
sical and lithological constitution. The differ- 
ent materials must have been gathered from 
different sources. This implies a difference in 



the direction of the ice movements which formed 
the several beds of drift. The differences in di- 
rection indicated are very considerable great 
enough to indicate that the centres of ice dis- 
persion must have been very different at dif- 
ferent stages of the ice period. 

On the whole, the evidence seems strong for 
the separation of the second glacial epoch from 
the third, and of the third from the fourth, in 
Britain, in northern Europe, and in Switzer- 
land. We are not prepared to follow Professor 
Geikie in the separation of the fifth glacial 
epoch from the fourth, and the sixth from the 
fifth. This separation is based on evidence 
which is far from convincing, if the word 
" epoch " is to retain the meaning which has 
been attached to it in this country. From the 
written page it does not appear that the fifth 
and sixth glacial epochs of Europe necessarily 
amount to more than considerable recrudes- 
cences of the ice which had been temporarily re- 
treating. But even if these so-called epochs rep- 
resent no more than minor advances of the ice, 
their recognition is a matter of some import- 
ance. It helps to emphasize what seems to be 
the fact in America as well as in Europe, that 
the glacial period was long and extremely com- 
plex. This is the conclusion to which detailed 
work on both continents seems to be surely 
leading. 

The chapters of this work which deal with 
the drift of North America were contributed 
by Professor T. C. Chamberlin. They embody 
much that is new in the way of suggestion and 
classification. In these chapters Professor 
Chamberlin directs attention to the fact that 
the recorded history of glaciation must really 
begin with the records left by the ice during 
its maximum extension, for at "that time the 
records of all preceding glacial history were 
largely destroyed or obscured. Any minor gla- 
cial epochs that may have antedated the great- 
est extension of the ice could hardly be expected 
to have left decisive records of themselves. 
After the maximum extension of the ice in 
North America, it is found that there was an 
interval when the ice retreated to a great but 
undetermined extent. Subsequently the ice 
advanced again, but reached a position less 
advanced than during the preceding epoch. 
While the great body of the first sheet of drift 
was either covered or worn away by the ice of 
the second advance, its outer margin was left 
uncovered. After the second advance, the ice 
was melted back again for a great but unknown 
distance. Subsequently it advanced a third

THE DIAL 



249 



time, but again failed to reach the limit which 
it had attained in the preceding advance. Thus 
the margin of the second sheet of drift remained 
uncovered by the drift of the third advance. 

Professor Chamberlin has proposed to name 
these several sheets of drift as other geological 
formations are named. Thus, the oldest sheet 
of drift, which is the only one present in Kan- 
sas, is to be known as the Kansan formation ; 
the second as the East lowan formation ; and 
the third as the East Wisconsin formation. As 
now exposed, the Kansan formation occupies a 
belt of variable width along the outermost bor- 
der of the drift. Theoretically, it should only 
fail where the ice of the second advance reached 
its earlier limit, or where it has been removed 
by erosion. The Kansan formation should un- 
derlie the East lowan formation to the north, 
except where it was destroyed by the ice of the 
East lowan (or some later) stage of glacial his- 
tory. The exposed part of the East lowan 
formation, so named because it is well developed 
in Eastern Iowa, and because it has been care- 
fully studied in that region, occupies a belt 
north of the exposed edge of the Kausan for- 
mation ; while the East Wisconsin formation 
lies still further to the north, sustaining the 
same general relation to the East lowan forma- 
tion that this does to the Kansan. 

Because of the controversy which has arisen 
in America concerning the distinctness of gla- 
cial epochs, Professor Chamberlin judiciously 
refrains from all assertion concerning the de- 
gree of distinctness of these several forma- 
tions. He does not even insist that they be 
referred to separate glacial epochs, but simply 
that these several formations be looked upon 
as marking distinct stages in the history of the 
ice period. These names may therefore be used, 
for the present, without raising the question of 
multiplicity of ice epochs. Whether these 
several formations represent distinct glacial 
epochs, or whether they represent sub-epochs 
only, must turn upon the meaning which at- 
taches to the term epoch. Until geologists have 
agreed upon the exact meaning of this term, 
as applied to glacial history, there is likely to 
be no harmony of opinion concerning the ques- 
tion of one or many glacial epochs. In this 
connection, Professor Chamberlin says : 

" If the ice age consisted of distinct glaciations sep- 
arated by climatic conditions as genial as those of to- 
day, they might as properly be called periods as epochs 
of glaciation. If the intervals of ice retreat, whether 
they amounted to complete disappearances or not, were 
comparable to the post-glacial period in duration, in the 
amount of erosion, weathering, soil production, vegetal 



accumulation, orographic movement, or other work done, 
or in the geniality of climate or the character of their 
life, they are surely entitled to be recognized as mark- 
ing epochs. If the intervals fall notably short of this, 
it is doubtless best to regard them as marking episodes, 
rather than epochs. The need for recognizing them 
would still remain, however, if we are to decipher and 
delineate the intimate history of the Ice Age." 

We suspect that many glacialists would not 
be willing to follow the above suggession in full. 
We suspect that many of them would hold that 
an interval of deglaciation might fall " nota- 
bly " short of the post-glacial interval, and still 
the re-advance of the ice constitute a separate 
glacial epoch, especially if the retreat and the 
subsequent re-advance of the ice were very con- 
siderable, and accompanied by climatic and 
orographic changes. If, for example, the ice 
retreated so far from its extreme position as to 
free the territory of the United States, and if, 
during this retreat, the region freed became 
temperate, a subsequent advance of the ice to 
the limit of the East lowan formation might 
perhaps not improperly be regarded as a dis- 
tinct glacial epoch, even if the deglaciation 
interval were notably shorter than the post- 
glacial epoch. Especially would this be true 
if the ice remained long in retreat, and if other 
events, such as changes of continental attitude, 
intervened. Even on the basis which Professor 
Chamberlin has proposed, there is in the minds 
of many geologists no doubt that at least two, 
and very likely three, distinct glacial epochs 
have affected the North American continent. 
A judicious reading between the lines makes it 
clear that this is Professor Chamberlin 's own 
belief. 

Concerning the cause of the glacial period, 
Professor Geikie appears to have changed his 
opinion since the earlier edition of his work 
appeared. In that edition Croll's astronomical 
hypothesis was advocated with apparently little 
hesitancy. In the present edition the discus- 
sion of the cause of the glacial period has been 
relegated to the end of the volume. This ar- 
rangement makes the chapter much less than 
heretofore an organic part of the volume, and 
it is distinctly pointed out that the general 
facts and relations of the drift are not depend- 
ent on any particular theory of glacial climate. 
While Professor Geikie still believes that 
Croll's hypothesis probably " contains a large 
element of truth," he does not regard it as a 
full solution of the vexed question. He further 
indicates that the complex drift phenomena of 
Europe " are evidence of a succession of 
changes too manifold, and perhaps occupying 



250 



THE DIAL

too short a space of time, to be accounted for 
by the cause to which Croll appealed." Pro- 
fessor Geikie's final conclusion concerning the 
question, as expressed in his own words, is as 
follows : " The primary cause of those remark- 
able changes is thus an extremely perplexing 
question, and it must be confessed that a com- 
plete solution of the problem has not yet been 
found." 

Concerning the relation of man to the gla- 
cial period, the conclusions of the volume have 
a special interest, since they represent a late 
view of the geological evidence relating to the 
antiquity of man. Professor Geikie's interpre- 
tation of the English cave deposits is as fol- 
lows : (1) That man, and certain locally or 
altogether extinct animals, co-existed in En- 
gland at some period of time ; (2) that this 
period was of long duration ; (3) that after oc- 
cupying the caves for untold ages, the paleo- 
lithic man disappeared forever ; (4) that the 
second or neolithic period of human occupancy 
is wholly distinct from the paleolithic ; it is 
widely separated in time and culture, and is 
accompanied by a distinct fauna and flora; 
(5) that, in general terms, continental cave de- 
posits yield a body of evidence of a closely sim- 
ilar character. He finds, further, citing much 
evidence, that the cave deposits, the valley drift, 
and the glacial and interglacial gravels pertain 
to one and the same general period, and con- 
cludes that that period lies between the culmi- 
nation of the second and third ice invasions.

ANOTHER SHORT HISTORY OF ENGLAND.* 

Among the numerous histories of England 
that are constantly appearing, a work by Pro- 
fessor Ransome demands more than passing 
attention. The author has already written " An 
Elementary History of England," " A Short 
History of England," and a series of lectures 
upon " The Rise of Constitutional Government 
in England." In addition, he is joint author 
with the Hon. A. H. Dyke Acland, M.P., of 
a very valuable handbook of English history. 
In view of the ambitious work before us, these 
writings may be regarded as preliminary stud- 
ies. 

There is a vast extent of history compressed

Times to the Present Day. By Cyril Ransome, M.A., Pro- 
fessor of Modern History in Yorkshire College, Victoria Uni- 
versity. New York : Macmillan & Co. 



between the covers of this volume, for palaeo- 
lithic man in Britain and the fall of Lord Rose- 
berry are its terminal pages. The whole field 
is divided by dynasties, into eight periods. 
According to the preface, the author aims 
to meet the wants of four classes of readers : 
(1) those wishing " to study in greater detail " 
special phases of English history ; (2) teach- 
ers who may wish " a fuller and more devel- 
oped treatment of events "; (3) university stu- 
dents ; (4) the general public " who wish to 
have in their hands a handy but fairly full his- 
tory to which they may turn for ready infor- 
mation or the historical points that crop up 
day by day in politics or conversation." We 
surmise that of these classes of readers, the first 
will be sadly disappointed ; for the arrange- 
ment being chronological, one has to hunt from 
page to page in order to follow any special line 
of thought. This calls attention to the main 
defect of the book, which is that it lacks con- 
tinuity ; so much detail being thrown in, that 
the philosophy of the political development of 
a period is obscured. The history of England 
from Henry II. to Edward I. covers essentially 
a constitutional period that of the so-called 
" Winning of the Charters "; but Mr. Ransome 
dwells upon events of that time with so much 
minuteness that the great generic causes and 
the large lines then laid are lost sight of. From 
an institutional point of view, Mr. Ransome's 
treatment of English history is very defective. 
The steady development of Parliament is not 
discernible throughout the period of its forma- 
tion. The Star Chamber suddenly appears 
under Charles I., but no allusion makes us ac- 
quainted with its origin ; and the same obser- 
vation is true of the Privy Council. This fail- 
ure to treat constitutional Tiistory as a thing 
apart from minor matters is a cardinal defect ; 
for subjects like these are more likely to be the 
" special phases " of interest to most readers. 

Naturally in so condensed a work, political 
history must occupy the largest space. Only 
where literature bears a close relation to poli- 
tics, is it more than incidentally dealt with ; 
and the same rule applies to manners and cus- 
toms. In this way the author has secured more 
space than Mr. Gardiner, in his well-known 
handbook. This is increased by omitting illus- 
trations also, much of the space thus saved 
being given and more profitably to maps 
(38) and genealogical tables (21). 

Mr. Ransome is a very positive Englishman. 
For example, we are told that " probably the 
greatest event in modern history is the devel- 



1895.]

opment of the British colonial empire " (p. 
vii.). Unless he dates modern history from 
1815, he will hardly be believed. The French 
Revolution, in comparison with this imperial 
fact, is styled " one of the epoch-making inci- 
dents of the world's history " (p. 855). If Mr. 
Ransome is right in his view of the importance 
of the British colonial empire, there is a poor 
outlook for the future, for it is asserted that 
" even now, with all our facilities of steam and 
electricity, a real knowledge of the wants and 
conditions of the colonies is rare" (p. 823). 
Some portions of the " History of England " are 
fuller and better than others. The account of 
the Roman occupation of Britain (pp. 15-16) 
implies too much to square with the subsequent 
account regarding Christianity in Britain (p. 
26). The way in which the complete displace- 
ment of the Keltic-Roman inhabitants is ac- 
counted for is very novel : 

" So ruiuous had been the long struggle that the Celts 
could no longer occupy their former possessions, so that 
the laud lay desolate. This last statement of Gildas 
supplies the key to much that has hitherto appeared 
obscure ; for if the settlements of the English were 
made not in lands from which the Britons had just been 
driven, but in districts which had for some time lain 
waste, then the disappearance of the British race, with 
its language, customs, and religion, and its complete 
replacement by the English race, becomes perfectly in- 
telligible and in strict accord with the only contempo- 
rary narrative that has come down to us " (pp. 22-3). 

But there are two defects in this view : In the 
first place, Gildas is a most unreliable author- 
ity ; and, secondly, the evidence of topography 
and archaeology are ignored. Moreover, if the 
struggle had been so ruinous " that the Celts 
could no longer occupy their former posses- 
sions, so that the land lay desolate," how does 
Mr. Ransome account for the exceedingly slow 
progress of the English conquest ? And, obiter 
dicta, why does he prefer the word " Saxon " 
to the more general term " English " ? 

On pp. 1089 the reader is disappointed to 
meet with the usual account of the causes and 
results of the Crusades. It is the rankest sort 
of writing of history, to say, in this day, that 
the Crusades began in 1096, and that Peter 
the Hermit was the genius of the movement. 
When Mr. Ransome is writing narrative, he is 
at his best. The account of the preliminaries 
to the Hundred Years' War is excellent, though 
it is much too much to speak of that war 
as " an utterly unnatural feeling of hereditary 
hatred between the two countries " (p. 246). 
Exception might be taken, too, to the state- 
ment that " Henry Fifth himself believed thor- 
oughly in the propriety of his demand " for 



the French crown (p. 316). It is more than 
likely that Henry was desirous of a pretext for 
foreign war in order that he might secure him- 
self more firmly in the hearts of the English 
people, for the title of the house of Lancaster 
to the throne was by no means clear. In dwell- 
ing upon the Hundred Years' War, it would 
be refreshing if English historians were less 
insular in their thinking. In English writings, 
the work of Bedford, since it lay in France, is 
assumed to have had slight influence upon En- 
gland. Yet the reforms of Bedford in France, 
when regent for the infant Henry VI., are 
largely accountable for Charles VII. 's sudden 
awakening ; he realized that if he were to re- 
cover France he must do so by counter-means 
of the same sort, which resulted in the French 
people rallying to the support of the crown, 
and the consequent expulsion of the English. 
French historians, although somewhat dazzled 
by the bright figure of Jeanne Dare, are better 
than English in appreciating the reciprocal in- 
fluence of Bedford's reforms upon those of 
Charles VII. 

Here and there a failure to be acquainted 
with late researches is betrayed in Mr. Ran- 
some's work. The paragraph (pp. 225-6) 
devoted to William Wallace represents him 
as a hero of Scottish independence, and not a 
rebellious feudal vassal, as Mr. Freeman has 
shown. Again, we are told, in speaking of 
early English local government, that " a group 
of townships formed the hundred. ... In the 
south, ' hundred ' was the term usually em- 
ployed ; in the east Midlands and in Yorkshire, 
' wapentake ' " (p. 43). Yet in 1888 Canon 
Taylor showed that the evidence of Domesday 
goes to show, if it does not prove, that the wap- 
entake was an administrative division compris- 
ing three " hundreds." Similarly, Mr. Ran- 
some seems to be unaware (p. 400) that late 
research has shown that Clement VII. actually 
granted a bull of divorce between Henry VIII. 
and Katherine. 

It may be unfair to judge a writer in a field 
in which his rival is the master, but the Puri- 
tan Revolution is very unsatisfactorily treated 
when compared with the account of Mr. Gardi- 
ner. There is next to nothing said of Cromwell's 
government ; nothing at all of his major-gen- 
erals ; the massacre of Drogheda is slighted, 
and Cromwell's continental and commercial 
policy resolves itself into the deeds of one man 
Blake. The author ventures to disagree 
with Ranke in respect of the character of 
Charles I.; while Charles II., on the other

hand, is said to have been " a man of consum- 
mate ability " (p. 642). Some other judgments 
may be questioned, e. g., Dunstan is pro- 
nounced " the most remarkable English sub- 
ject who lived before the Norman Conquest " 
(p. 65). How about Godwine? John is said 
to have been well-read, though his learning 
rests on the statement that he once borrowed 
a book from the abbot of St. Alban's, which 
Stubbs thinks of slender authority (p. 168). 
Shakespeare's delineation of Richard III. is 
accepted (p. 299). On p. 540 occurs the 
statement that " Pym was quite of opinion that 
Laud and Strafford had been engaged in a sys- 
tematic plot, the one to overthrow Protestant- 
ism, the other parliamentary government. . . . 
This is now known to be a caricature of Straf- 
forcTs real position." Are we, then, to believe 
that Laud seriously intended to overthrow Prot- 
estantism ? The loss of Waterloo is attributed 
directly to Napoleon (p. 908). And, speaking 
of Napoleon, is there not a touch of irony in 
the allusion to the " beautiful and healthy " 
island of St. Helena (p. 910) ? The statement 
has the sound of an Englishman's hereditary 
hatred of Bonaparte. So, also, Mr. Ransome's 
estimates of Castlereigh and Canning have a 
Tory ring (pp. 912, 936). 

E'it criticism to be just must be relative, not 
absolute. The exceptions taken above have 
been in matters where there is room for honest 
doubt ; and a good author always has preposses- 
sions in his favor. Moreover, they are few in 
number compared with the amount of matter 
presented ; the defects indicated represent pro- 
protionately a slight percentage of the narra- 
tive. For a book of information, presenting a 
clear, succinct narrative, Mr. Ransome's " His- 
tory of England " will take rank with the best 
handbooks. To the public at large who wish 
to have a ready source of information as to 
facts and facts are the body of history it 
will commend itself. The correlation of these 
facts, what Guizot called the physiology of his- 
tory, is less evident, and perhaps was not in- 
tended. The thoughtful reader in this case 
will dwell upon what he here reads ; while in 
the case of the university and college student, 
the very absence of this element allows room 
for original force and suggestion ; he must 
think for himself if he would understand. 

At times, however, even in the domain of 
facts, Mr. Ransome is manifestly wrong. The 
most obvious example of this, to an American 
reader, at least, is the statement that " In 1861 



a war broke out between the northern and 
southern sections of the United States. . . . 
The slave -owning States of the South viewed 
with apprehension the rise of an Abolitionist 
party in the North, and when Abraham Lin- 
coln, an Abolitionist [!] was elected president, 
they declared their intention of seceding from 
the union" (p. 999). If a second edition of 
the " History of England " is called for, it is to 
be hoped that Mr. Ransome will first read the 
platform of the Chicago Republican Conven- 
tion, and also Lincoln's first Inaugural. More- 
over, he has yet to learn that the negroes were 
not freed, and could not be enfranchised, by 
an act of Congress (p. 1000). 

A few minor errors may be pointed out, 
which are doubtless due to oversight : The 
peace of Wedmore was in 879, not 886 (p. 55) ; 
Cnut, not Harold, became king in 1017 (p. 
75) ; Americans, at least, speak of Bunker 
Hill, not Bunker's Hill (p. 824) ; Louis XVI. 
was executed Jan. 21, 1793, not in February 
of that year (p. 860) ; the French Empire was 
declared in May, not December, 1804. 

In style the narrative is plain and unvar- 
nished, to the point of tediousness ; it is hard 
reading ; yet that, perhaps, is to be expected 
in a work of such condensation. But at times 
the language is careless. The average reader 
would infer an old English township and a bor- 
ough to be governmentally wholly distinct from 
one another, owing to omission of the word "or" 
in the last paragraph on p. 41. Again : " When 
Tacitus wrote, few German tribes were ruled by 
kings, but kingship was universal among the En- 
glish who had settled in Britain " ("p. 46). One 
would infer that the English, when on the con- 
tinent, were of two sorts those who had kings 
and those who had not. Mr. Ransome's think- 
ing is not always clear. We are told (p. 854) 
that from one point of view the French Revo- 
lution was " the abolition of mediaeval feudal- 
ism "; from another, " the abolition of privi- 
lege," whereas the essence of feudalism was 
privilege. So, again, in the account of the 
States General of 1789, there is lack of defin- 
iteness of statement (p. 858) ; and on p. 866 
the Spanish and Dutch fleets, in 1795, are sud- 
denly found cooperating with France, though 
no reason is given for the fact. Perhaps, 
though, more has already been required than it 
is right to expect from an author seeking to 
compress the enormous space of two thousand 
years into a thousand pages.

A NEW ARCTIC BOOK.* 

If the reader will look to his map of Europe, 
he will find lying off the far northwestern out- 
skirts of Russia, in the Arctic Ocean, a con- 
siderable island named Kolguev. This Kol- 
guev (pronounced Kol-gwev) is so little known 
that the adventurous soul of Mr. Trevor-Bat- 
tye, an English traveller of some experience, 
was drawn toward it with a view to exploration. 
" Whether those were right who had main- 
tained that we should find it quite impossible 
to land at all ; whether, if we did succeed in 
landing, we should discover a harbor where 
the Saxon might be secure ; what birds, flow- 
ers, and mammals we should chance upon ; 
whether we should find people there, or only a 
desolate and barren land, in a word, the idea 
of the unknown, this it was which really at- 
tracted me, as it has attracted many before." 

This ignorance was, however, in a degree 
unnecessary. If the author had taken down 
so common a reference book as " Chambers's 
Encyclopaedia," he would have read under 
"Kolguef ": " It is visited in summer by fur- 
hunters, and fowlers, who capture eider-ducks, 
swans, and other sea-birds that yield down. 
The only permanent inhabitants are a few 
Samoyedes." While Kolguev is not quite the 
terra incognita that Mr. Trevor-Battye would 
have us believe, yet it is sufficiently unknown 
to justify such an expedition as he undertook. 

On the second of June, 1894, our author 
left Peterhead, Scotland, on the steam yacht 
" Saxon." The rather commonplace voyage 
is described in Chapters I.-V., which might 
easily have been omitted. In Chapter II. he 
puts this curious preface to his three-page de- 
scription of Tromso : " Many of my readers 
will know Tromso and its surroundings far 
better than I, and can skip this next bit, 
which I simply take straight out of my journal 
as it stands." Surely what most readers would 
skip is just the thing to omit. The book-mak- 
ing traveller is often tempted to pad. 

The reader will, then, miss nothing by waiv- 
ing unimportant preliminaries, and begin with 
Chapter VI., where our author is set down on 
the lonely isle, and his real adventures begin. 
After six days of tramping, he succeeded in 
finding some of the native Samoyeds, and he 
lived with or near them for the next three

months. These people moved from pasture to 
pasture with their herds of reindeer, which 
subsisted chiefly upon lichens. When a party 
once stopped to bait the deer, he found that in 
ten minutes they ate " the lichen which lay 
around them without moving from where they 
stood." Although snow lay in patches all 
summer, yet flies and mosquitoes were some- 
times very troublesome. Under record of July 
19, he says : " The mosquitoes were bad to- 
day, and gnats were in clouds. I think the 
Samoyed name for mosquito is so good 
4 nyanink ' they call it, from the noise and its 
stab. ' Nya ' is its singing, and then * nink,' 
and in goes its horrid stab." 

The staple food of the Kolguev Samoyeds is 
the wild goose. Mr. Trevor-Battye gives a very 
interesting description of a " goosing." Thou- 
sands of wild geese were driven into a trap, 
and there despatched with clubs. They then 
hid them under fresh turf for a few days, and 
afterward prepared them for winter's use. Mr. 
Trevor-Battye learned many Sarnoyedic prac- 
tices, but he never mastered their method of 
eating. " The Samoyeds held the food between 
their teeth, and with the other end in their left 
hand cut quickly upwards, with the knife close 
to their noses. We tried this, but not success- 
fully. It requires much practice, because of 
your nose." Our author got on very well with 
his Samoyed acquaintance. He even succeeded 
in obtaining some of their idols, or bolvans, 
which they usually conceal with great care. 
But one of his successes was so discreditable 
that we wonder he records it. On his ex- 
ploration of their Holy Hill, he was accom- 
panied by a guide who kept sharp watch on his 
visitor. " I felt he had his eye on me all the 
while, for whenever I moved a hand towards 
the bolvans he turned quickly around with a 
cunning intelligence on his face. But I was 
one too many for him. For I offered him a 
cigarette which I had made from a leaf of my 
note-book. And while he was stooping down 
to light this, I managed to slip a small bolvan 
and the spoon into my pocket unperceived." 

Mr. Trevor-Battye's description of the Sam- 
oyeds is fuller and closer than Mr. Jackson's 
account in " The Great Frozen Land," recently 
reviewed in THE DIAL (Sept. 16, '95), but on 
the whole they confirm each other. He finds the 
Samoyeds a simple, friendly people, of much 
ability in certain ways, and he resents the con- 
trary imputations of other writers. " Why," 
he asks, " does Nordenskiold put these Samoy- 
eds at the bottom of the Arctic Mongol group ?

He makes them the lowest. And why does 
Carlyle, casting about for an instance of hope- 
less barbarity, pitch on the poor Samoyed? 
This book, if it shows anything, will surely 
reveal the Samoyed as an extremely intelligent 
man, far and away more so than the Red In- 
dian." 

The main part of this book may be cordially 
recommended to the general reader as an en- 
tertaining narrative of varied adventures and 
experiences. The style, as is apparent from 
our quotations, is very lively, but sometimes 
becomes careless and slangy. The book is pro- 
vided with maps and scientific appendices, and 
is fully illustrated with interesting drawings by 
various artists. HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



RECENT ENGLISH NOVELS.* 



It must be admitted, curious as is the fact, that 
there are hardly half a dozen English novelists now 
living and to the manner born, whose work is as 
acceptable and as deserving of praise as that of a 
Dutchman of letters who has chosen to use the En- 
glish language rather than his native idiom, and 
has learned to use it so effectively that he must be 
reckoned to all intents and purposes an English 
novelist. Those who indulge in dreams of a time 
when English shall have become the universal lan- 
guage may well find a happy omen in the fact that 
a foreigner, who might easily occupy the foremost 
place among his contemporaries in his own country, 
should be found willing to relinquish such an honor 
for the sake of enrolment in the English literary 
guild, and for the sake of the larger audience that 
he is thus enabled to reach. The case is almost, 
if not quite, unparalleled in nineteenth century 
literary history, for neither Ochlenschlaeger nor Dr. 
Brandes, neither Heine nor Tourgue'nieff, ever be-

came so completely naturalized in Germany or 
France, respectively, as " Maarten Maartens " has 
become in the republic of English letters. It is in- 
teresting to note, in this connection, the recent re- 
port that Sig. d'Annunzio has decided henceforth 
to write primarily for French rather than for Italian 
readers. Such cases, however, must at the best be 
sporadic ; it will not frequently happen that writ- 
ers of one country will have both the inclination 
and the ability to make of the idiom of another the 
chief medium of their expression. " My Lady 
Nobody," the latest novel of our Anglicized Dutch- 
man, is one of the strongest novels of the season, 
although we are inclined to rank it a little below 
God's Fool " and " The Greater Glory." It is 
without the thin veil of poetical allegory that gives 
so great a charm to those two books, although it 
is quite their equal in shrewd observation, genial 
humor, and sane envisagement of the relations of 
everyday life. The characters do not seem quite 
as sharply realized as they might have been at 
least, some of them do not and an uncertainty in 
the use of English idiom is now and then noticeable. 
But the book is a very human document, after all 
for Dutch humanity is very much the same as 
any other and does equal honor to the head and 
the heart of the writer. 

Mr. Mallock, doubtless, would wish his latest 
work of fiction to be described as " a human docu- 
ment," and, indeed, he gave that very title to one 
of its predecessors. But the claim may be made 
for " The Heart of Life " only with some qualifi- 
cation. It is not so much essential humanity with 
which Mr. Mallock deals as humanity of exotic or 
morbid type. This, at least, must be said of the 
three or four characters upon which he has spent 
the most pains. And there is throughout the work 
a disagreeable streak of perverted feeling, an envis- 
agement of the ethical problems of sex, that needs so 
ugly a word as " nasty " to give it adequate expres- 
sion, and that vitiates the atmosphere of the entire 
book. This is no new thing with Mr. Mallock, as 
readers of his earlier books do not need to be told. 
Having lodged this needed caveat, we will hasten 
to do justice to the better qualities of the novel in 
question. So careful a work, written in so graceful 
and cultured a style, is calculated to give consider- 
able pleasure to readers of taste, in spite of the 
subtle immoralities of its conception. There is a 
well-bred air about it all, and a command of felicit- 
ous phrase, that bespeak attention and interest. 
Particularly in the delineation of the Countess 
Shimna does the writer display his best literary 
qualities. She is one of those fascinating foreign 
women in whom he delights, and she is presented 
with a poetical investiture that completely capti- 
vates the on-looker and wins for her his instant 
sympathies. The character of Pole, likewise, is 
built up from within rather than from without, and 
wins respectful sympathy. Into this latter charac- 
ter Mr. Mallock has put no little of himself a

remark suggested not so much by Pole's specific 
attitude toward socialism as by the whole tenor of 
his life and mental habit. As for Pansy the 
other woman who plays ducks and drakes with his 
heart we must give her up as quite unintelligible. 

Mr. R. S. Hichens, whose amusing skit " The 
Green Carnation " stirred up the menagerie of the 
decadents a few months ago, has now. produced a 
serious piece of fiction. " An Imaginative Man " 
may be described as a study in morbid psychology 
that ends in nothing less than insanity. The hero 
is a man of high-strung and sensitive nature, self- 
centred and cynical, who, married to a pretty and 
commonplace woman, takes her to Egypt for a win- 
ter vacation. He sees the Sphinx for the first time 
in his life, and is thereby inspired with an absorb- 
ing passion. He cannot tear himself away from the 
fascinating presence of the mysterious statue, and 
finally, in a mad ecstasy, dashes out his brains against 
its base. The story sounds bald, and even ludi- 
crous, in this outline, but it is not so in the reality. 
The steady encroachment of madness upon his in- 
tellect is subtly worked out, and a sombre poetry 
invests the successive scenes of the drama, inviting 
to anything rather than mirth. We must say, how- 
ever, that about the minor episodes of the story there 
is something repulsive, in spite of the imaginative 
quality of it all ; and that the night scene in Cairo, 
with all its force and vividness, is a thing that could 
have no place in a work of serious and wholesome art. 

Careful characterization without which no work 
of fiction can expect to be taken seriously has not 
usually been looked for in Mr. Rider Haggard's 
novels. In this respect, "Joan Haste" is a marked 
advance upon any of its predecessors, for it intro- 
duces us to three or four characters which are de- 
lineated with fairly satisfactory art. This is par- 
ticularly true of Sir Richard Graves, of whom we 
receive a really vivid impression, and who thinks 
and acts in a consistent way throughout. The new 
novel has nothing to do with strange scenes or 
peoples; it gets along without the accessories of 
mystery and carnage in which the author has been 
wont to delight ; it is simply an English story, deal- 
ing in semi-melodramatic fashion with a few hack- 
neyed themes. It does not prepossess one in its favor 
to learn that it turns upon the betrayal of a young 
girl by an English nobleman, upon the self-sacrifice 
of the girl Camille-f ashion at the instance of 
an agonized parent's pleadings, and upon the dis- 
covery when too late that she is the heiress to a 
great property. Yet it is undeniable that Mr. Hag- 
gard has made an interesting tale out of these sit- 
uations, and that we forget at the time of reading 
how utterly hackneyed they are. The story loses 
in vigor and reality toward the end, and the wind- 
ing up of its complications is excessively bald and 
unconvincing. Nor are the characters all well done, 
for that of Samuel Rock is about as grotesque and 
unreal as any that is ever met with in the most pre- 
posterous sort of fiction. 



" The Emancipated," although just published in 
the United States, is not, we understand, Mr. Giss- 
ing's latest novel. We are happy to say that the 
unqualified condemnation we felt bound to bestow 
not long ago upon a recent production of that writer 
is by no means to be dealt out to the volume now 
before us, which impresses us as the best of Mr. 
Gissing's novels that we have read. It is certainly 
untainted by the vulgarity characteristic of so much 
of his work, and contains studies of a number of 
men and women in whose company it is pleasant to 
be. Then there is the background of Southern Italy 
to cast a sort of glamour over the pages. It would 
be a poor book indeed that could not attract by the 
frequent use of such magic names as Capri, Paes- 
tum, and Amalfi. Mr. Gissing presents us with 
several types, or rather degrees, of intellectual 
emancipation, and his moral appears to be that such 
a thing as too much freedom is quite possible. An 
undercurrent of rather bitter feeling about English 
Puritanism runs through the book, and the author 
seems to out- Arnold Arnold upon this subject. The 
best character-study is that of the woman who out- 
grows the Puritan environment of her early years, 
and discovers that the world offers a larger air and 
a freer view than may be found in the dissenting 
society of a stagnant English town. 

The lady who writes over the signature of 
" Tasma " is usually entertaining, although her work 
never rises far above the plane of mediocrity. There 
is considerable variety of character and incident in 
" Not Counting the Cost," and a somewhat ques- 
tionable moral. The heroine, that is, does not ac- 
tually violate the conventional code, but is saved 
from so doing by a series of fortunate accidents, 
rather than by a resurgence of principle strong 
enough to defy temptation. We are somehow left 
with the impression that it would not have been 
very wrong for her to assure her family a comfort- 
able existence at the cost of her own honor. The 
story of this little group of Tasmanians, self-exiled 
in Paris, and struggling against heavy odds for a 
subsistence, has much pathetic verisimilitude, and 
seems to be told from first-hand knowledge of the 
main conditions. 

The title of Mr. Frank Barrett's latest novel will 
best illustrate how wide a departure has been taken 
from the conventional lines of even the romance of 
adventure. It runs as follows : " A Set of Rogues ; 
to-wit : Christopher Sutton, John Dawson, the Seftor 
Don Sanchez del Castillo de Castellafta, and Moll 
Dawson, their wicked conspiracy, and a true ac- 
count of their travels and adventures, together with 
many other surprising things, now disclosed for the 
first time, as the faithful confession of Christopher 
Sutton." In other words, Mr. Barrett has given 
us a very good imitation of the picaresque fiction of 
the seventeenth century, with a suitable archaism 
of diction, and a fine sense of the appeal of mere 
reckless adventure to the unsophisticated imagina- 
tion. We read this story, just as we read its pro-

totypes of two centuries ago, with sheer interest in 
the doings of the persons concerned, and with little 
care for the morality of their actions. They start 
out to gain fraudulent possession of an estate, and 
we cannot help hoping that they will succeed, so un- 
moral is the atmosphere of the tale. When they do 
eventually accomplish their purpose, we rather ap- 
plaud them, and are reduced to so wicked a frame 
of mind that we hope they will not be found out. 
Later in the narrative, they exhibit marked com- 
punctions of conscience, by no means in keeping 
with their characters, and we cannot but think that 
the intrusion of this note is an artistic error. Lamb's 
well-known theory of the conventional character of 
the Restoration drama applies equally to works of 
this class, and is one of the profoundest truths to 
which that great critic ever gave expression. Eth- 
ical motive has no place in a story like this, and 
one may rejoice in the turpitude of such a " set of 
rogues " without the slightest danger of falling out 
of moral equilibrium. We have in this book one of 
the best stories of adventure that recent years have 
brought to our reach. 

" When Charles the First Was King " is a his- 
torical novel in the manner of Dr. Doyle's " Micah 
Clarke," but rather more artificial and laborious 
than that striking work of fiction. It is told in the 
first person by an eye-witness of some of the stir- 
ring events that led up to the Commonwealth, and 
its incidents are seen in the retrospect of old age. 
The narrator was not a soldier, except for a brief 
time and as it were by accident, but he was mixed 
up in the great fight at Marston Moor, and met 
Cromwell face to face. Historical study of the 
period and a close familiarity with the Yorkshire 
country have stood him in good stead, and his 
story, if not wildly exhilarating, is at least well- 
planned and interestingly told. 

Dr. Conan Doyle's latest publication will not add 
to his reputation. It is in form a series of letters 
addressed by a young English surgeon to a friend 
in America, descriptive of the struggles of the for- 
mer to gain a professional foothold and to attain 
mental equilibrium in matters of philosophical and 
religious concern. This double motive is at work 
in every chapter of the correspondence, and the 
juxtaposition is utterly incongruous. Most readers 
will skip the moralizing (which is of a rather callow 
sort) and fix their attention upon the very slender 
thread of the story, only to be disappointed in the 
pettiness and poverty of the narrative. The one seri- 
ous attempt at characterization is the singular Cul- 
lingworth, whose preposterous antics may be found 
amusing, but who is no more a real living figure 
than any wooden puppet worked by strings. If 
Dr. Doyle cares anything for his literary standing, 
he will abandon the sort of pot-boiling of which 
this book is a flagrant example, and will seek to 
regain public confidence by means of the historical 
novel, of which he is an undoubted master. 

Mr. Weyman is better advised in this respect 



than Dr. Doyle, and does not stray from the field 
in which he has won a well-deserved success. His 
passages "From the Memoirs of a Minister of 
France " are a series of imaginary episodes in the 
life of the Due de Sully, running from about the 
period when his royal master had concluded that 
Paris was worth a mass, to the inception of the 
Great Design, and the foul crime that left that 
gigantic plan only a dream. These chapters dis- 
play inventive powers of a high order, and show 
their author's remarkable insight into his chosen 
period of history. Each of them is a story com- 
plete in itself, yet the character of the great Min- 
ister links them together into one chain. They are 
more than interesting ; they are true to the essen- 
tial facts of history, without for a moment becoming 
dull or pedantic. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Early in the seventies, a familiar 
% ure at the New York Union Club 
was a stately, well-mannered, neatly- 
dressed gentleman of seventy odd years, pleasantly 
known to younger habitues as the " Old Tycoon." 
This gentleman who ( to quote his nephew, Pro- 
fessor Brander Matthews) " disliking the noisy, 
fast, stock-exchange element of the club," chose to 
pass his time " talking sense " at one end of the 
room with the few, while the many " talked dollars " 
at the other was Townsend Harris, America's 
first Envoy to Japan, a man who did perhaps as 
much as any individual toward unsealing the Her- 
mit Kingdom to the commerce and ideas of the 
West. Among the foreign diplomatists who assisted 
in that work, it is Mr. Harris's distinction to have 
left by far the kindliest impression on the minds of 
the Japanese. He is remembered by them to-day 
as " the nation's friend." Says the native writer, 
Nitobe' : u The mission of Perry was that of a pion- 
eer ; that of Harris, a sower. The duty of one was 
to force a barred door open ; that of the other was 
to keep it open. ... If an ambassador, according 
to Wotton's definition, ' is an honest man sent abroad 
to lie for his commonwealth,' Harris was no diplo- 
matist. If, on the contrary, an American minister 
to an Oriental court is a representative of the moral 
principles of the great Christian Republic, Harris 
deserves the name in its best sense." The volume 
before us, " Townsend Harris, First American En- 
voy to Japan" (Houghton), edited by Mr. Wm. Elliot 
Griffis, consisting of Mr. Harris's Japanese diary, 
together with some complementary biographical and 
historical chapters by Mr. Griffis, is a very timely 
and acceptable book. Since the outbreak of the 
late war in the East, competent writers have shown 
us in ample detail the New Japan, politically a 
modern power, and fast outgrowing her period of 
tutelage ; but the New Japan cannot be understood, 
still less the nation's long and heroic effort in thfr

way of self-transformation be appreciated, without 
attaining a notion of what Japan was at the time 
the process of change began. To this end, readers 
will find the present work decidedly helpful. The 
journal extends from August 21, 1856 (the date 
of Mr. Harris's landing as Envoy at Shimoda), to 
February 27, 1858, when the hard-won treaty open- 
ing the Japanese ports was ratified. The obstacles 
he encountered in the way of native insularism, and 
official duplicity and obstruction, seem almost in- 
credible in view of the Japanese character of to-day. 
The journal is largely a record of a long and exas- 
perating contest with native officialdom a process 
of alternate wheedling and " bluffing " on the part 
of the Envoy against a race of " diplomatists " who 
for " ways that are dark and tricks that are vain " 
showed themselves no whit behind their Chinese 
counterparts, and would have easily distanced the 
comparatively ingenuous Talleyrands and Metter- 
nichs of Europe. Once, the badgered Envoy writes 
plumply, " They are the greatest liars on earth " 
a statement somewhat modified later on. It was 
not until September 25, 1857, that Mr. Harris re- 
ceived permission to go to Yedo to present the Pres- 
ident's letter to the Mikado in person a prelim- 
inary step to a second stage of tedious diplomatic 
fencing with the experts of the native Circumlocu- 
tion Office. The battle, however, was finally won ; 
and in 1859 Mr. Harris's services were rewarded 
by the appointment, on President Buchanan's nom- 
ination, as Minister Resident of the United States to 
Japan. He resigned in 1861, reaching America to 
find the nation he had served so well rent by civil 
war. Says Mr. Griffis : " It was while returning 
home, in an agony of fear for the safety of the 
Union, that the loyal American, Townsend Harris, 
was directly and personally insulted by the Captain 
of a British mail steamer flying the Confederate 
flag. Englishmen often wonder whether Americans 
' hate ' them, and why." Perhaps the captain thought 
reprisals were in order for our usual ante-election 
performances in regard to the Irish Question. Mr. 
Harris's diary forms an interesting and valuable 
document, and the editor has put it in excellent 
shape for the use of general readers. 



The Japan 
of to-day. 



The Chino-Japanese war has made 
it painfully evident that the fanciful 
notions long- current regarding the 
" child of the world's old age " stand badly in need 
of revisal. To go on patronizingly viewing Japan 
as a clever child mimicking the ways of its elders, 
and amusing itself for a space with its toy army, 
toy fleet, toy railroads, telegraph, etc., is out of the 
question since Yalu and Port Arthur. Japan her- 
self has all along resented the unflattering flattery 
ladled out to her by amiable visitors like Sir Edwin 
Arnold; and it is now plain that what may be 
termed the globe-trotter view of her must be re- 
placed by something more actual and prosaic. To 
this end we know of no book at once more concise, 
practical, and comprehensive than Mr. J. Morris's 



" Advance Japan " (Lippincott). The author was 
long connected with the Tokio Department of Pub- 
lic Works, and his pages have naturally a slightly 
statistical flavor. He aims to call attention to 
the more serious side of the Japanese, to their solid 
qualities of perseverance and ambition of excelling, 
and particularly to the strong mechanical bent 
which has contributed largely to raise them to their 
present position. He endeavors to show that the 
Japanese, so far from being, as popularly supposed, 
essentially a race of clever copyists with " a genius 
for assimilating," have a marked turn for initiative; 
and that they are already inventing and developing 
from their acquired standpoint on lines peculiarly 
their own. To select a striking if rather question- 
able example, the Murata rifle used by the Japan- 
ese forces, and one of the most destructive and 
efficient weapons extant, is a native invention. An 
idea of the staple matter of the volume may be 
gathered from such chapter-headings as " Admin- 
istration," " Natural History," " Dress, Diet, and 
Manners," " Mines and Minerals," " Armaments," 
" War with China," " Colonization and Trade," 
" The Future of Japan." Each chapter is a com- 
pact summary of its subject-matter, from a point 
of view intimated in the rather flamboyant title of 
the volume. Mr. Morris is a decided Japanophile ; 
and while his facts are undoubtedly accurate, we 
think it is to be regretted that he has not toned 
down his somewhat optimistic views and forecasts 
with a tincture of the frank criticism and admoni- 
tion that Japan just now peculiarly needs. She 
has had applause and flattery enough to spoil a less 
practical people. Carlyle, we remember, getting 
impatient of the prolonged chorus in praise of 
George Washington, once grimly announced his 
intention " to take George down a peg " ; and there 
is possibly a growing number of those who await 
with interest the candid soul who shall do the like 
by Japan. As to the late war, it is quite true that, 
as Mr. Morris says, Japan " thrashed her enemy 
within an inch of her life " ; but the exploit would 
seem to be, on her friends' showing, largely exag- 
gerated. It does not seem to occur to the recent 
writers who, on one page, hold up the Chinese 
army to scorn as an " unorganized mob," and laud 
the Japanese army as a " magnificent fighting- 
machine " on the next, that they are thereby show- 
ing their idol's victory to have been a hollow affair 
relatively, and a poor criterion of what Japan 
might be expected to do if confronted in the field 
by a " fighting-machine " on a footing with her 
own. Mr. Morris has something to say of Japan's 
past history; and he sensibly scouts the popular 
error that she has put on Western civilization like 
a garment miraculously transforming herself, as 
it were, overnight, on the French plan in '89. As 
the French Revolution smouldered for a century 
before breaking into flame, so Japan's startling 
changes in 1867-8 were due to the final upheaval 
of a political system long undermined by natural 
agencies. Japan too had, if on a narrower and

more local scale of doctrine, her philosophes, her 
volunteers of the pen, her Rousseaus, Diderots, and 
Condorcets, who riddled the time-worn fabric of 
feudalism with solid bolts of fact and reason, as it 
tottered to its fall. The present volume contains 
a number of plates, including some interesting 
charts and cuts of naval and military engagements 
in the late war. 

Dr. Edward S. Holden's informing 

book n " The M S ul Emperors of 
Hindustan " (Scribner) may be gen- 
erally described as a mosaic of well-chosen extracts 
from the best native and foreign authorities. The 
author's own rather slender contribution to the text 
is creditable and scholarly, and serves to give it 
some degree of narrative consistency. The chief 
authorities consulted are the Memoirs of the em- 
perors themselves, which are freely quoted; the 
standard histories of Elphinstone, Malcolm, Ers- 
kine, Price, Hunter, and Howorth ; the records of 
early missions and voyages ; the translations of the 
native historians, by Sir Henry Elliot, Professor 
Dowson, and Professor Blochmann. Chapter VIII., 
on " The Ruin of Aurangzeb," is a reprint of Sir 
William Hunter's fine sketch of the downfall of the 
last great Mogul emperors. The present author has 
not essayed to give the history, or even a continuous 
historical study, of the reigns in question, but rather, 
as he says, " to present such views of the personages 
involved as an intelligent reader of the histories 
themselves might wish to carry away." This aim 
seems to us to be amply fulfilled. The work opens 
with a concise account of Tamerlane (in which it 
is made clear that Marlowe knew little beyond the 
truculent side of his Scythian Shepherd's nature), 
thence passes on to the reigns of Babar, Humayun, 
Akbar, Jahangir, the Empress Nur-Mahal, Shah 
Jahan and Aurangzeb, and closes with an Appen- 
dix comprising a list of the various conquests of 
India, beginning with Alexander's, and ending with 
Babar's, in 1525. There is also a useful chrono- 
logical and genealogical table. There are a number 
of curious illustrations, mainly portraits of the Mo- 
gul rulers, many of them from the originals in the 
British Museum, and a few from miniatures belong- 
ing to the author. By thus selecting and putting 
together in compact shape information hitherto so 
widely dispersed and difficult of access, Dr. Holden 
has done general readers a real service. 

French royalty Miss Anna L. Bicknell's graphic 
t the days of the papers in " The Century Magazine " 

Second Empire. ^ Qn L j fe j n ^ Tuilerieg under the 

Second Empire " have been issued, by the Century 
Co., in a handsome volume. Miss BickneJl was 
the English governess of the daughters of the 
Duchesse de Tascher de la Pagerie, the daughter- 
in-law of the Empress Josephine's first cousin who 
was installed with his household in the imperial 
residence throughout the Second Empire. On the 
friendliest terms with the family of her charges, 



Miss Bicknell was an actual inmate of the Tuileries, 
seeing the Emperor and Empress almost daily, and 
meeting familiarly the members of their immediate 
entourage. She is thus enabled to paint for us in 
minute and familiar detail royalty minus its state 
robes and formalities. A warm admirer of the 
Emperor, she dwells on his unaffected gentleness 
and amiability, his unfailing courtesy to all, from 
minister to lackey, giving many anecdotes illustra- 
tive of these traits. Toward Euge'nie she is less 
friendly; the estimate of her, as of her husband, 
tallying closely with that of M. Paul de Lano, 
whose opinion we have just cited. Portraiture and 
anecdote form the staple of the volume, which is 
well written and commendably free from question- 
able gossip and " revelations " of the baser sort. 
Of the little Prince Imperial, " a pale, grave child," 
yet with his due share of a boy's turn for mischief, 
some humorous stories are told none so humor- 
ous, however, as an accompanying portrait, repre- 
senting him (at about five) clad in the uniform of 
the Old Guard, and nearly extinguished by a bear- 
skin shako that might have adorned one of his 
grand-uncle's grognards. Alas, the brief humors 
of the ill-starred Prince's childhood merge into pa- 
thos when one thinks of the boyish figure, a few 
years later, stretched cold and stark on the turf of 
distant Zulu-land the terrible assegai wounds all 
in front, for he died facing his foes, as became a 
scion of the great Emperor. " When he saw," said 
the Zulus who had slain him, " that he was for- 
saken and could not escape, he turned on us like a 
young lion " ; and an eye-witness thus describes the 
finding of the body : " He was lying on his back. 
His head was so bent to the right, that the cheek 
touched the sward. His hacked arms were lightly 
crossed over his lacerated chest, and his face, the 
features of which were nowise distorted, but wore a 
faint smile that slightly parted the lips, was marred 
by the destruction of the right eye from an assegai 
stab." 

M. Pierre de Lano's " Napoleon 
IIL " the second volume in the Se- 
cret of an Empire " series (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), shows an advance in serious historical 
and personal interest over its rather gossipy and 
sensational predecessor. The author is as favorably 
disposed toward the Emperor as he was unfavorably 
toward his wife who, supposing M. de Lano's ac- 
count of her to be measurably true, was not only a 
cold wife and mother, a fickle friend, and a par- 
venue, but (as the instigator and fomenter of the 
German war) a grave state criminal as well. M. 
de Lano's portrait of Napoleon III. is pathetic and 
engaging. In his pardonable admiration for the 
Emperor's private character, he endeavors, with 
some plausibility, to show that the iniquitous Coup 
d'Etat of 1851 was virtually a revolution, in which 
its reputed author is to be regarded rather as a 
semi-passive protagonist, who, the sport of destiny, 
was borne resistlessly on by the current of events,

and partly forced to enact his questionable role. 
The plea seems to us decidedly more ingenious 
than convincing. The volume closes with a spir- 
ited account, the details of which will be new to 
most readers, of Eugenie's flight from Paris after 
Sedan, under the protection of the American den- 
tist, Dr. Evans. The affair throughout strikingly 
recalls the historic flight to Varennes, the Doctor's 
too-sumptuous carriage taking the place of the ill- 
starred berline, and the little town of Evreux, 
where the fugitives were recognized and stopped by 
a mob, only lacking a Drouet and a Mayor Sausse 
to have fairly completed the parallel. The book is 
graphic and piquant, and repays reading. 

An attractive volume entitled " Na- 
P leon ' s Last Voyages'; (Lippin- 
cott) comprises the diaries, first of 
Admiral Sir Thomas Ussher, who conveyed Bona- 
parte to Elba on board the ." Undaunted," and, 
secondly, of John R. Glover, Secretary of Rear- 
Admiral Cockburn, who conveyed him to St. Helena 
on board the "Northumberland." We suppose 
these documents are authentic ; but it is to be re- 
gretted that the editor has left us in the dark as to 
their history, and as to whether they have or have 
not been before published, entire or in part. There 
is a note, however, appended by Mr. Glover to his 
diary, stating that the same was kept for his own 
gratification, and particularly requesting that anyone 
into whose hands it may fall shall not copy or print 
it. How long this request was obeyed, we are not 
told. The editor's contribution to the volume con- 
sists of a few not indispensable notes, and some 
rather superfluous facts as to Admiral Ussher, 
whose portrait is also thrown in. The journals 
themselves, especially Mr. Glover's, are very inter- 
esting. On the voyage to St. Helena, Napoleon 
seems to have conversed about himself, his past, his 
friends, and his rivals, with astonishing freedom ; 
and Mr. Glover's notes on the habits and appear- 
ance of the royal captive are fresh and graphic. 
An interesting feature of the volume is the portraits 
of the Emperor chance sketches, several of them, 
showing him as he appeared at the time, and in 
characteristic attitudes. 



Syrian history, Dr - William Wright's comely volume 
archaeology, entitled " Palmyra and Zenobia " 

and travel*. (Thomas Nelson & Sons) is about 

evenly compounded of history, archaeology, and 
travels. In the way of history, the author naturally 
does not attempt to add much to what the early 
historians have told us of Zenobia's disastrous con- 
flict with the Romans ; but he has nevertheless 
availed himself to some extent of current popular 
traditions, a source to which he inclines to ascribe 
more weight than his predecessors have done. " In 
a bookless land," he says, " traditions are carefully 
preserved among a people who talk and listen, but 
do not read, and the wonderful story of the Sitt 
Zeinab (or Lady Zenobia) is scarcely more myth- 



ical on the lips of the Palmyrans and Bedawin, 
than is that of Zenobia Augusta in the pages of 
Trebellius Pollio, Zosimus, and Vopiscus." The ex- 
plorations and incidents recorded are the fruit of a 
nine years' sojourn in Syria ; and as the writing 
was done on the spot, partly in the saddle and partly 
in the tent, it is unusually fresh, crisp, and full of 
local color. Half the volume is devoted to the 
ruins of Palmyra and the story of Zenobia, and the 
remainder to travels and adventures in Bashan and 
the desert. The illustrations are profuse, and of 
much archaeological interest. 



Sheridan 
as a" Great 
Commander." 



The latest volume in the " Great 
Commanders" series (Appleton) is 
a life of General Sheridan, which 
was completed by the late General Henry E. Davies 
only a month before his death. The author served 
under Sheridan during the whole of his Eastern 
command, and admires him most heartily ; but the 
book has little of the vivacity that personal acquaint- 
ance and experience might have given it. From 
the number of its details, it fails to make upon the 
reader the impression that a more artistic grouping 
of the wonderfully interesting facts of Sheridan's 
career might make exceedingly vivid. It is a solid 
piece of work, showing painstaking labor, and may 
be relied on as a history of that part of the war in 
which Sheridan was engaged. The special interest 
lies in the chapters describing Sheridan's reorgani- 
zation of the cavalry forces of the army of the Po- 
tomac against the strenuous opposition of General 
Meade, his brilliant campaign in the Shenandoah 
Valley, and his even more brilliant work in head- 
ing off Lee's army and making its capture inev- 
itable. This brief narrative shows that Sheridan's 
success was not merely that of a dashing trooper, 
but that he possessed the solid qualities of a great 
military leader, caution, power of combination, 
quickness in seeing and seizing an advantage, per- 
sonal attractiveness, and power of winning the con- 
fidence of his troops. 



Lord Nelson's 
career and 
character. 



The Life of Nelson written for the 
"English Men of Action" series 
(Macmillan) by Mr. J. K. Laughton 
is a straightforward narrative of the career of En- 
gland's brilliant naval hero. The author indulges 
in no fine writing, and the first half of the book is 
a little heavy; but when the story of Nelson's 
achievements in the wars of the French Revolution 
is reached, there is no lack of life, for the events 
described are such as turn the current of history 
and change the destinies of nations. The tone of 
the book is sympathetic yet judicial. While the 
greatness of Nelson's deeds is acknowledged, and 
the lovable qualities of the man and officer, and his 
genius as a naval commander, are fully described, 
the other side of the hero's character is not hidden. 
His disgraceful relations with Lady Hamilton, his 
vanity and jealousy and insubordination, are set 
forth fully enough to give a true portrait.

Mr. M. J. Knight has prepared, in two volumes, " A 
Selection of Passages from Plato for English Readers " 
(Macmillan). The selections are from Jowett's trans- 
lation, and the work carries out an expressed wish of 
the late Master of Balliol. In fact, the selection was 
made in large part by Jowett himself, having in mind 
the needs of the University Extension student and of the 
general reader. "The metaphysical part of Plato's 
philosophy has been kept in the background, attention 
being drawn especially to the political and ethical ideals 
which form a great part of his teaching, and which, like 
the simple truths of religion, have a peculiar and un- 
dying attraction for ourselves." Each extract has a 
brief introduction by Mr. Knight, and the work is fur- 
nished with a good index. 

The revival of interest in the popular fiction of a past 
generation has brought us many reprints of old favor- 
ites, and it has been clearly only a question of time 
when the romancer of the solitary horseman should 
have his turn. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons now issue, 
in what they call the " Fontainebleau Edition," the 
" Richelieu " of G. P. R. James. There are two neat vol- 
umes, boxed, without illustrations. If this is the fore- 
runner of a complete edition of James, the publishers 
have before them a task of no little magnitude. 

ProfessorC. Horstman, late of the University of Ber- 
lin, has edited for the " Library of Early English Writ- 
ers " the works of Richard Rolle of Hampole and his 
followers (Macmillan). The volume is the first to be 
issued in the series to which it belongs, and contains no 
less than 442 closely-printed pages. There is no index, 
or even conspectus of the contents of any sort, and the 
Introduction, written in ponderous Teutonic style, gives 
practically no clue to the contents of the work. This 
introduction, we are informed, is "to be continued," 
but as to when, where, or why, the bewildered student 
gets no intimation. We are, of course, thankful for 
the bare text, but we should be doubly thankful were it 
accompanied by a modicum of useful apparatus. 

Messrs. Curtis & Co., of Boston, publish a " Hand-

of the building the architecture and the painting 
all of which are described at length, and well illustrated 
by photographic reproductions. The history of the 
library is not, however, wholly neglected, nor its special 
collections and other bibliographical features. Boston 
may take a just pride in such an incorporation of the 
higher civic ideals as this noble building with its con- 
tents embody, and visitors to the institution will do well 
to provide themselves with the pamphlet which has oc-

some that are by no means his best, aimed at giving an 
idea of his work that would be fairly accurate as well 
as pleasing." The editor's introduction, which extends 
to some sixty pages, is a critical and biographical study 
that exhibits high qualities of scholarship and discern- 
ing taste. Notes, a glossary, and an index, complete 
the apparatus of this admirably-executed text.

notify the American agents, Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons, New York. 

Southey's " English Seamen," edited by Mr. David 
Hannay, and Izaak Walton's lives of Donne, Wotton, 
Hooker, Herbert, and Sanderson, are the newest volumes 
in the beautiful and inexpensive series of "English 
Classics," issued under the general supervision of Mr. 
W. E. Henley, and published in this country by Messrs. 
Stone & Kimball. * 

Three additional autumn publications announced by 
Messrs. Way & Williams, Chicago, are : " Under the 
Pines, and Other Verses," by Mrs. Lydia Avery Coon- 
ley, whose poems are not unknown to the readers of 
periodical literature ; " Nim and Cum, and the Won- 
derhead Stories," a volume "for children and their 
elders," by Mrs. Catherine Brooks Yale ; and " The 
Little Room, and Other Stories," by Mrs. Madelene 
Yale Wynne, with cover-design, frontispiece, and deco- 
rations, by the author. 

The new House of Commons includes in its member- 
ship the following men of letters, among others: Mr. 



A. H. D. Acland, Mr. H. O. Arnold-Foster, Mr. A. J. 
Balfour, Mr. Augustine Birrell, Mr. James Bryce, Mr. 
George N. Curzon, Sir Charles W. Dilke, Mr. R. B. 
Haldane, Mr. R. C. Jebb, Lord Lome, Sir John Lub- 
bock, Mr. Justin McCarthy , Mr. T. P. O'Connor, Mr. 
H. M. Stanley, and Sir George Trevdyan. Compari- 
son with the American House of Representatives would 
be too " odorous " for our patriotism. 

Messrs. George H. Richmond & Co., New York, an- 
nounce a sumptuous edition of Henri Beyle's famous 
romance, " La Chartreuse de Parme," which has never 
before appeared in English. The edition will be a 
limited one in three volumes, with thirty-two etchings 
and an etched portrait of the author. The same firm 
will issue a limited edition of a " Letter from Captain 
Cuellar to His Majesty Philip II." The letter is one 
to which Froude makes reference in his " Spanish Ar- 
mada," and is now first translated into English by Mr. 
Henry D. Sedgwick, Jr. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, following the example 
of other houses, have just issued a neat portrait catalogue 
of their publications. Nearly a hundred faces appear, 
some of them far from familiar to the general public. 
We note particularly the fine heads of Mr. R. D. Black- 
more, the Rev. Stopford A. Brooke, Mr. Thomas Hodg- 
kin, and Dr. Augustus Jessopp. Another meritorious 
catalogue, combining attractive typography and paper 
with well prepared matter, is issued by Messrs. J. Sel- 
win Tait & Sons. By means of compact descriptions 
and brief quoted characterizations, the reader is enabled 
to form a fair general idea of each work in the list. 

Mr. Arthur Way and Mr. Frederic Spencer have 
collaborated in the preparation of a pamphlet volume 
summarizing " The Song of Roland " for English read- 
ers (Macmillan). The greater part of the epic is con- 
densed into prose narrative, but the more striking epi- 
sodes are put into a rough sort of English verse, of which 
we subjoin a specimen : 

" Roland is ware of the hand of death ; 

with such might as he may 
He upriseth, and rallieth his strength 

O me, but his face is grey ! 
He hath grasped sword Durendal bared ; 

before him a brown rock rose ; 
In sorrow and wrath he smiteth thereon 

ten giant blows." 

One can get a very fair idea of the substance and spirit 
of the great epic from this little volume. 

The next publication of the Grolier Club of New 
York will be an edition of the Poems of Dr. John 
Donne, reprinted from the edition of 1633, revised by 
James Russell Lowell, with the various readings of the 
other editions of the seventeenth century, and with a 
preface, an introduction, and notes by Professor Norton. 
The edition will be in two sixteenmo volumes, printed 
from new Scotch type on German hand-made paper, and 
will contain portraits of Dr. Donne, and other embel- 
lishments. The work is expected to appear in Novem- 
ber. It is interesting to note, in this connection, that 
the new Caxton Club of Chicago, an organization some- 
what similar to the Grolier, contemplates reproducing, 
as its first publication, Franklin's edition, issued in Phil- 
adelphia in 1744, of Cicero's " Cato Major, or Discourse 
of Old Age." The translation is one made for Frank- 
lin's edition by Judge Logan of Philadelphia; and in 
the reprint it is intended to reproduce, so far as prac- 
ticable, the characteristic features of Franklin's typo- 
graphy.

among the chefs-d'oeuvre of the century." Le Figaro (Paris), May 4.

In introducing to American readers the work of the popular Danish 
novelist, Holger Drachmann, the publishers have selected "Paul and 
Virginia of a Northern Zone " as one of the most characteristic and at- 
tractive of his shorter tales. It is a story of simple life upon a North- 
ern strand, of storm and wreck at sea, of youth and its triumphant love. 
The work is at once romantic and realistic ; written in a charming poetic 
style, with masterly descriptive power, and strong coloring from the 
scenes and life where it is laid.

A Necromaunt in Three Chimeras by THOMAS T. STODDART. 
With an introduction by Mr. ANDREW LANG. 16mo, car- 
dinal buckram, $1.50 net. 

Mr. Lang in his introduction says: "The extreme rarity of the 
Death- Wake ' is a reason for its republication, which may or may not 
be approved of by collectors. Of the original edition one author says 
that more than seventy copies were sold in the first week of publication, 
but thereafter the publisher failed in business. . . . The 'Death- 
Wake ' is the work of a lad who certainly had read Keats, Coleridge, 
and Shelley, but who is no imitator of these great poets. He has, in a 
few passages, and at his best, an accent original, distinct, strangely 
musical, and really replete with promise. He has a fresh unborrowed 
melody and mastery of words, the first indispensable sign of a true poet. ' '

the Nineteenth Century," " England in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury," etc. Beautifully illustrated with twenty-three full- 
page half-tone Portraits. 8vo, 456 pages, $2.50. 
This new volume shows that Mrs. Latimer still wields the pen of a 
ready writer. Her already large circle of readers will receive the new 
volume gladly, for it comes fraught with fascinating historical gossip 
on matters, some of which are so recent that they seem almost like 
current news. The exploits of Livingstone and Stanley and Gordon ; 
the settlement of Liberia, and especially of Maryland's own colony 
there ; the founding of the South African Republic, the Orange Free 
State, and the Congo Free State these and many other subjects are 
treated in a style so pleasantly familiar, attractive, and entertaining, 
that the book once taken up cannot be laid down until it is finished. 

THE CHILD'S GARDEN OF SONG.

rector of the Apollo Club of Chicago and of the Children's 
Choruses of the World's Fair. With beautiful colored de- 
signs by ELLA RICKETTB. Quarto, $2.00. 
" It is in every particular the daintiest performance we have seen, 
and we are sure that it will meet with the enthusiastic approval of the 
public. A conspicuously beautiful feature of this volume is the illus- 
tration thereof by Ella Ricketts drawings wholly in harmony with the 
delicacy, purity, and sweetness of the songs, and demonstrating clearly 
the genius of the artist. These pictures, which adorn every page of the 
book, are printed in eight colors, and they surpass, both in point of 
design and in point of execution, everything attempted in this line in 
this country." EUGENE FIELD in The Chicago Record.

" The Countess was the daughter of a Polish nobleman and sixteen 
years old when she began her journal, which covers two years of the 
life of a young woman who was the great-great-grandmother of both the 
King and Queen of Italy. It is a very open and full diary, just such 
as one would expect from a bright young woman of that age." Boston 
Time*. 

NUMBER 49 TINKHAM STREET. 

By C. EMMA CHENEY, author of " Young Folks' History of 
the Civil War," etc. 12mo, 267 pages, $1.00. 
" A simple, often touching little story which seeks to point out some 
of the ways in which the children of the slums may be won from the 
degradation bred of their environment, and led to better things. Doubt- 
less every such effort would meet with difficulties and discouragements 
not set down in this simple tale, but there is little doubt but the general 
idea embodied, is in harmony with the laws of humanity, and the im- 
portant thing, the spirit in which every such effort should be made, is 
reflected simply and sweetly." Boston Traveller. 

BEATRICE OF BAYOU TECHE. 

By ALICE ILGENFBITZ JONES. 12mo, 386 pages, $1.25. 
" It is more than ordinarily well written, full of fanciful turns of 
phrase, and short, charming pen pastels, and would be agreeable read- 
ing even were the story a less pulse-quickening one." Commercial 
Advertiser, New-York. 



MEANS AND ENDS OF EDUCATION. 

By the Rt. Rev. J. L. SPALDING, author of "Education and 

the Higher Life," " Things of the Mind," etc. 12mo, 232 

pages, $1.00. 

This book is written in the concise, epigrammatic style of which 
Bishop Spalding is such a master. Every sentence is pregnant with 
suggestive thought, and affords food for much reflection. 

The author " Marks the educational value of books by their power to 
set the intellectual atmosphere in vibration, thereby rousing the mind 
to self-activity. His thesis on ' Woman and Education ' is a fine analy- 
sis and elegant presentation of the subject." Chicago Inter Ocean. 

A CHILD OF TUSCANY. 

By MARGUERITE BOUVET, author of " Sweet William," " My 
Lady," etc. Illustrated by WILL PHILLIP HOOPER. Small 
4to, 207 pages, $1.50. 

This is a sweet, wholesome, and cheerful story, bright with Italian 
sunshine, and warm with its author's " kindly love " to all the youug. 
The scene is laid in the city of Florence and its richly picturesque- 
neighborhood. The characters are all Italian. The children will follow 
with unabated interest the career of the little peasant hero, who, by 
unselfish love and patient, persistent labor, rises from poverty to wealth. 
Miss Bouvet's large circle of young readers will eagerly welcome this 
story from the pen of one who has given them so much pleasure and 
profit in the past.

A Romance of Osgoldcross, 1632-1649. By J. S. FLETCHER, 
author of " The Wonderful Wapentake." 12mo, 418 pages, 
$1.50. 

" The story is capitally told. The descriptions are alert and vivid. 
There are a number of taking battle-pieces, as for instance that of 
Marston Moor. Taken all in all, ' When Charles the First was King ' 
is good, bluff, honest fiction, and you will read it to the last page." 
The Commercial Advertiser, New York.

A volume of criticism that is truly discriminating and appreciative. 
It consists of able reviews of the works of Emerson, Lowell, Whittier, 
Longfellow, Bryant, Whitman, Blake, Cowper, and Wordsworth. Be- 
ing himself a poet, Mr. Cheney is the more capable of pointing out the 
beauty and strength of other men's work.

and instead of confining itself mainly to the inculcation of reverence for 
motherhood, discusses the mutual relations of the sexes and the intri- 
cate problems arising from individual and race development. " I find 
it hard," writes an authority who read the book in manuscript, "to 
speak of the work in measured terms of praise."

THE TEACHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL. 

Those with whom biography, and particu- 
larly autobiography, is a favorite form of read- 
ing, often have occasion to note the influence 
exerted by teachers of strong personality upon 
men who have afterwards attained sufficient 
distinction to make the story of their lives 
worth reading about. The literature of auto- 
biography is full of tributes appreciative, 
affectionate, grateful, and reverent to the 
memory of the men who, at the impressionable 
age of the writers' lives, gave to them the bent 
that was to remain characteristic, inculcated 
the ideals of learning or of conduct that were 
thereafter to be pursued. The affection of Mar- 
cus Aurelius for Fronto, of Xenophon and 
Plato for Socrates, are classical instances that 
at once rise in the memory. The tribute of the 
Florentine to his teacher, met upon the Fiery 
Plain of the Seventh Circle, and reminded of 

"La cara e buona imagine pater n a 

Di voi, quando nel mondo ad ora ad ora 
M'insegnavate come 1'uom s'eterna," 

has been repeated, with every possible shade of 
tender expression, by all sorts and conditions 
of men of the modern world, down to the pupils 
of Arnold at Rugby, and of other teachers of 
our own day. The name of many a faithful 
teacher has been rescued from the oblivion 
that else awaited it by some such tribute as that 
of Dante to Brunetto, uttered by some voice 
that has compelled the world's attention, and 
many a reader of such utterances has felt a 
responsive thrill of gratitude as he has recalled 
the devoted ministrations and sympathetic guid- 
ance of some teacher of his own youth. 

It is to be noted that in nearly all cases of 
the class now under discussion, the teacher is 
remembered as an individual, a distinctly- 
marked character, a personal influence for 
good ; rarely, if ever, as the representative of 
a system or the exponent of a method. Stress 
is laid upon the fruitful contact of soul with 
soul, not upon the workings of the educational 
machinery, however nice the adjustment of its 
parts. Nor is the teacher thus held in grate- 
ful remembrance because of his success in cram- 
ming the student with facts, or because of his 
skill as a disciplinarian. Success of this sort 
may be accounted highly by administrative 
educational bodies, but is as nothing in the 



276 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



afterglow of the student's recollection, unless 
associated with success of a very different kind. 
It is wisdom rather than knowledge, sympa- 
thetic insight rather than mere strength of will, 
that makes upon the student a lasting impres- 
sion and leaves him with an abiding sense of 
deep obligation to his mentor. However com- 
pletely a teacher may achieve the lower aims 
of educational work the aims that are tested 
by examinations, and theses, and the observa- 
tion of official visitors a student will feel but 
slight personal indebtedness if the higher aims 
have not at the same time been sought after 
with equal strenuousness. It is in the realiza- 
tion of these higher aims that the pith of the 
matter is found, and school inspectors (unless 
they be men of the Matthew Arnold type) can 
know next to nothing of the degree to which 
they have been realized. 

Many wise writers upon education have 
sought to set forth the really vital aims of the 
art pedagogic; none, perhaps, more success- 
fully than Mr. John Morley. He says : 

" There appear to be three dominant states of mind, 
with groups of faculties associated with each of them, 
which it is the business of the instructor firmly to es- 
tablish in the character of the future man. The first 
is a resolute and unflinching respect for Truth; for the 
conclusions, that is to say, of the scientific reason, com- 
prehending also a constant anxiety to take all possible 
pains that such conclusions shall be rightly drawn. 
Connected with this is the discipline of the whole range 
of intellectual faculties, from the simple habit of cor- 
rect observation, down to the highly complex habit of 
weighing and testing the value of evidence. The second 
fundamental state in a rightly formed character is a 
deep feeling for things of the spirit which are unknown 
and incommeasurable ; a sense of awe, mystery, sub- 
limity, and the fateful bounds of life at its beginning 
and its end. The third state, which is at least as diffi- 
cult to bring to healthy perfection as either of the other 
two, is a passion for Justice." 

Here is a programme indeed, one not embodied 
in any official document, and quite irreducible 
to the neat formulas of methodology, yet more 
or less distinctly present in the consciousness 
of every true educator, and the object of his 
most earnest desire. Such were the aims of 
Socrates, as far as we may disentangle them 
from the iridescent web of Platonic expression ; 
such have been the aims of the inspired teach- 
ers of all generations since. 

What, it may well be asked, is the bearing 
of these extremely abstract considerations upon 
the actual problems of the present educational 
day? To us the reply seems very obvious. 
Such aims as we believe to be the most essen- 
tial of all in education are not easy of attain- 
ment at best, and whatever tends to repress the 



individuality of the teacher tends also to make 
impossible the attainment of these aims. Most 
teachers, in most civilized countries to-day, are 
so cabined, cribbed, and confined, by admin- 
istrative prescription, that they are not free to 
be individuals at all ; they are only cog-wheels 
in the machinery. What we are sometimes 
tempted to call the curse of centralization 
has so fallen upon most of our educational or- 
ganizations that the very word " system " has 
come to have the connotations of lifelessness, 
and inadequacy, and dull uniformity. The 
higher education has generally learned the 
lesson that system, although an excellent ser- 
vant, is a poor master, but the lower education 
everywhere calls loudly for emancipation. The 
teacher in a German Gymnasium, a French 
lycee, an English board school, or the school 
of an American city, is so hampered by need- 
less regulations and requirements, by the drudg- 
ery of unnecessary bookkeeping and prescribed 
written work, by the exigencies of over-de- 
tailed courses of instruction and ill-chosen text- 
books to say nothing of the negative embar- 
rassment resulting from a sadly deficient school 
equipment that he becomes utterly disheart- 
ened at the thought of doing good work under 
so great a variety of adverse conditions, and 
can only resign himself to his fate. 

Take the matter of text-books alone : a text- 
book is a tool, and its chief excellence is in 
being fitted to the hand that must use it. There 
is no more reason why a teacher should have 
forced upon him a text-book that he does not 
like than there is for denying a cabinet-maker 
the right to select his own tools. It is irra- 
tionally urged that a school system must be 
based upon the use of uniform school manuals ; 
whereas uniformity in such a matter is not even 
desirable, let alone being necessary. In our 
own country, we act for the most part upon 
the crude theory that administrative boards 
may properly select the text-books to be used 
by teachers, and the patent evils for which this 
notion is responsible are counted as nothing in 
comparison with the blessings of uniformity. 
The simple truth is that uniformity in this and 
many similar matters is the veriest bugbear, 
and that what is needed more than anything 
else is the reduction of prescriptive uniformity 
to the barest minimum. In fact, the attitude 
of the educator towards this subject should be 
that every sort of uniform regulation must give 
indubitable proof of its necessity before it has 
any right to exist ; the prevalent attitude being, 
we need hardly say, that the presumption is in 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



277 



favor of the uniform rule. Local option is as 
essential to educational as to political vitality, 
and it should be extended not merely to every 
school, but to every individual teacher, in every 
case possible. !* ? 

The urgent plea, heard at all educational 
gatherings, and voiced in all educational jour- 
nals, that we need better teachers in our schools, 
is doubtless the one to be kept most prominent 
in current discussions, and can hardly be re- 
peated too persistently. But when the ques- 
tion of ways and means comes up, there are 
opportunities for a wide divergence of opinion. 
What we most need is pedagogical training, 
says one ; another rides the hobby of increased 
superintendence ; a third finds in higher sal- 
aries and permanent tenure a sovereign remedy 
for the evil of inefficient teaching. All these 
opinions have their weight ; and, doubtless, 
our teachers would be better as a class if more 
of them were first professionally trained, then 
wisely guided during the early years of their 
work, and all the time assured of advancement in 
proportion to the development of their ability, 
and of a compensation befitting the high char- 
acter of their calling, and the social status which 
should of right be theirs. But, excellent as all 
these things are, we venture to think a still 
worthier aim that of making the profession of 
teaching attractive by making it one that may 
be pursued without the loss of self-respect. We 
do not get the best kind of men and women in 
our schoolrooms, mainly because we make it 
only too evident that we do not want them. 
The kind of person who ought to be there is 
the kind of person who is not likely to be will- 
ing to submit to the petty regulations with 
which most of our teachers are hedged about. 
Too many of our public school systems have 
as their basis distrust of the teacher's ability, 
and even of his honesty. Then, when it is sug- 
gested that such and such matters may very 
suitably be left to the discretion of the indi- 
vidual teacher, we are informed that he cannot 
be trusted to deal properly with them. There 
never was a more vicious circle of reasoning. 
The formula seems to be : first, to eliminate 
from the schools all persons likely to have and 
to exercise good individual judgment ; second, 
to complain that those who are left cannot be 
trusted to think for themselves, but must have 
their work laid out for them on the most rigid 
lines. We firmly believe that this deliberate 
suppression of the teacher's individualism is one 
of the greatest evils that now exists in our pub- 
lic education, and that it offers a field for the 



reformer quite as promising as that which is 
offered by the question of superintendence, the 
question of professional training, or the ques- 
tion of compensation and tenure. 



THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AND 
THE MAKING OF WRITERS. 

The recent volume on the teaching of English, 
made up of the papers contributed to THE DIAL 
during the past year by sundry college professors, 
suggests a train of thought to the literary worker, 
the main points of which may herewith be set down. 

Anyone who takes the trouble to examine the 
book, and who knows the earlier conditions of En- 
glish culture in our institutions of learning, must 
perforce testify to the betterment of the situation 
chronicled therein. In half a dozen or more places 
in this country, the student may now, instead of the 
vague, aimless aesthetico-critical smattering that did 
service aforetime, receive a symmetrical and catho- 
lic training in the linguistic, historical, comparative 
and purely literary aspects of a study which is com- 
ing properly to be recognized as a natural culture- 
centre for men and women of our speech. By adopt- 
ing the German method and taking advantage of 
the specific courses at several colleges, a post-grad- 
uate scholar can get a broad training such as was 
not dreamed of a generation ago. 

But conceding this improved situation, a question 
of paramount importance to the embryo litterateur 
arises : to-wit, Under present conditions may one 
wishing to fit himself for the career of letters take, 
with the best results, the modern course in English 
offered by a progressive university or college ? The 
latter-day tendency, increasingly, is to emphasize 
the philological side of English study ; this being a 
reaction from the previous too exclusive devotion 
to aesthetics, and a natural result of the wonderful 
development in the vigorous young science of lan- 
guage. Like all reactions, in some quarters it has 
gone too far, so that occasionally a thinker like Pro- 
fessor Corson sounds a note of warning. Young 
men have forgotten literature in a still-hunt after 
the umlaut ; they have failed to see the forest for 
the leaves. But while the attention to philology, 
as such, may be prosecuted with a zeal which for- 
gets that at least for the future literator it is but 
a means to an end, it is quite true that a thorough 
grounding in historic English, enabling the student 
to trace steadily the evolution of both language and 
literature from the beginnings, makes the best pos- 
sible basis for all other exercise in the use of the 
mother-tongue for purposes of literary creation. He 
who has traced organically English literature from 
the start, who knows not only his Chaucer and 
Shakespeare, but his Beowulf and Caedmon as well, 
may be trusted to have a sense of English as an 
instrument of expression and a medium of thought 
such as one not so thoroughly indoctrinated could 



278 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



not command. If the initial severe linguistic drill 
be not allowed to swamp {esthetic taste and inter- 
est, he who undertakes it will rejoice thereat for the 
rest of his literary life. 

It is further to be said that he who now essays 
to study English, looking eventually to literary 
work, gains much from the fact that the subject 
can be pursued in its historic associations, atmos- 
pherically : in other words, English can be investi- 
gated as one of the allied groups of Germanic 
tongues. The English scholar of the present day 
makes the acquaintance not only of Old English, 
but of the German, Dutch, and Scandinavian lan- 
guages, and he gets in this way a comparative sur- 
vey of the speech and literature of a number of 
important and richly productive tongues bound by 
blood-ties to his own. The immense advantage to 
literary culture of attention to the classics has been 
insisted upon, time out of mind : a similar drill, and 
a similar, though perhaps not equal, enrichment is 
won from a knowledge of these linguistic first and 
second cousins of English. Thus, to indoctrinate 
the English-speaking and English-reading person 
for purposes of culture is surely quite as well as to 
steep him in the classic lore traditionally regarded 
as the beginning of philological and other wisdom. 
By this collateral study, as we might call it, a grip 
on the mother-tongue, an insight into her idioms 
and thought-modes and modes of expression, to- 
gether with a comprehension of those qualities she 
shares with her sister-languages, may be gained, 
such as shall prove invaluable to the writer. At 
the same time, he acquires the elements of com- 
parative criticism and is in a position to go on and 
get all the more from the wider linguistic and 
aesthetic experience of Greek and Latin. This pos- 
sibility of beginning language and literature study 
at home, with the native tongue, and working out 
therefrom by way of the germane tongues, the im- 
proved methods now obtaining have put within the 
reach of all. 

And the literary worker in posse has, too, the 
vantage-ground of some sort of organized treatment 
of the several departments of English whether 
philological, critical, or aesthetic. The curricula 
outlined by the teachers in the book suggesting 
these reflections showed plainly enough such a 
recognition. Doubtless the articulation of the parts 
will be clearer in time to come : it may well be 
that, sometime, the scientific historical study of the 
drama, the essay, fiction, and poetry, in their gen- 
era and species, will be pursued in some such fash- 
ion as was adumbrated by a DIAL correspondent 
months ago and great were the gain thereof. 
But the student can now at least elect courses in 
the historic development of language and literature, 
in the dynamics as well as statics of the subject, 
with a proper culmination in the spiritual philoso- 
phy underlying more technical and material phases 
of his work, which should furnish forth a writer 
well-equipped and in the best sense informed with 
a true culture. 



The individual literary forms, then, are begin- 
ning to be studied in what may be called, with no 
unpleasant implication, the scientific spirit, which 
is just the way to help the writer to the technique 
of his craft. In fine, the present hopeful status is 
expressed when we say that the teaching of English 
to-day, in the enlightened centres, puts the student 
in the way of mastering the rationale and the tech- 
nique of his work ; thereby restraining and mould- 
ing to the best and highest uses the fund of aesthetic 
appreciation which, if it be in him by birthright, 
will be fostered, not killed, by this broad, stern, 
wholesome discipline. And this, English instruction 
can now claim to do for anyone who undertakes the 
study with the intention of adopting literature as a 
life-work. The writer of this article (if he may be 
pardoned a personal reference which illustrates his 
point) subjected himself for a term of years to a 
strict philological training, with the expectation of 
taking up work which would be a natural sequella 
to such study. And although he has deflected into 
journalistic and general literary work, he wishes to 
testify that he would exchange for no other drill, 
extending over the same time, the familiarity with 
the organism of language and literature derived 
from that close and on occasion dry experience with 
English in its past and present story. It is an ex- 
perience needed to place the worker on easy terms 
with his tools ; it is an influence which should do 
much to remove the taint of Bohemianism which 
from time immemorial has been detected in the 
works and ways of Buckthorne and his friends.

E UGENE FIELD. 

The sudden death of Eugene Field, on the fourth of 
this month, removed a conspicuous figure from the 
small group of literary people who make Chicago their 
home. He was probably the most widely known of 
them all, for his ten years' unbroken connection with a 
local newspaper had wrought for his reputation the 
usual cumulative effect ; he was, besides, a familiar 
figure on the platform, and, as a reader of his own 
verses, had become known to many thousands of hear- 
ers. Born in 1850, he was in the prime of life at the 
time of his taking-off , and his later work gave evidence 
of progress towards a riper culture than he had, for the 
most part, displayed in his earlier writings. His talent 
deserved a better fate than that of lifelong service to 
journalism, the taskmaster that impelled him to many 
a hasty and unconsidered utterance. Time will sift 
the meritorious things in his work from the heap of 
unsightly scoria in which they are embedded, and is 
likely to preserve the better among his lyrics. His life 
was lighted by 

44 The loveliest lamp for earthly feet, 
The light of little children, and their love," 

and it is as a poet of childhood that he will be chiefly 
remembered. His published writings consist mainly of 
two books of prose tales, two books of verse, and a 
paraphrase of Horace.

PATER'S LAST VOLUME.* 

This second posthumous collection of Mr. 
Pater's essays, of " miscellaneous studies," has 
probably been expectantly waited for by a 
larger number than greeted any of the books 
published during his lifetime. Mr. Pater's 
reputation extended but slowly. There must 
have been many readers of Mr. Mallock's 
" New Republic " twenty years ago who won- 
dered somewhat at that singular and disagree- 
able Mr. Rose. Who was it that could be 
put in along with Matthew Arnold and John 
Ruskin? At that time Mr. Pater was gen- 
erally known only by his studies in " The 
Renaissance." To-day it is not so unnatural 
to think of him as one of the chief critics of 
art and literature of our day. His seven vol- 
umes are well-known, and he is well or ill 
thought of by many. 

Different people value him for different 
things. For my part, on reading this last 
book of his, I think mostly of Mr. Pater's 
ideal of a way of life, of the group of some 
half-dozen very distinctive characters which 
he created, and of his rather singular style. 
A style Mr. Pater certainly had, although there 
exists no very valuable characterization of it. 
" Long-drawn music " it is called by one, and 
" whipt cream " by another ; but more definite 
views are somewhat to seek. It is an interest- 
ing style, however, and one which rather chal- 
lenges a man to define it. One thing obvious 
enough is that in the course of the thirty years 
in which his work was published, his style 
underwent a great change. Certain enduring 
qualities his writing always possessed, it was 
always scholarly, always harmonious, always 
subtle, and there were also certain constant 
minor habits, but in his later years his style 
had undergone so great a change that many ad- 
mirers of " The Renaissance " must have been 
out of patience with " Plato and Platonism." 
The reader of this posthumous volume will be 
interested in looking first at " Diaphaneite," 
the earliest piece of his work that we have, and 
then at " Pascal," the last. In a greater de- 
gree he will experience what he may have re- 
marked in reading the essay on Coleridge in 
"Appreciations," the first half of which ap- 
peared in 1866 and the second in 1880. The

difference wrought by fourteen years is not 
quite so marked as that wrought by thirty, but 
still it is not very hard to perceive it. In 
" Diaphaneite " he writes ; 

" Simplicity in purpose and act is a kind of deter- 
minate expression in dexterous outline of one's person- 
ality. It is a kind of moral expressiveness ; there is 
an intellectual triumph implied in it. Such a simplicity 
is characteristic of the repose of perfect intellectual 
culture. The artist and he who has treated life in the 
spirit of art desires only to be shown to the world as 
he really is; as he comes nearer and nearer to perfec- 
tion, the veil of an outer life not simply expressive of 
an inward becomes thinner and thinner. This intel- 
lectual throne is rarely won. Like the religious life, 
it is a paradox in the world, denying the first conditions 
of man's ordinary existence, cutting obliquely the spon- 
taneous order of things." (P. 217.) 

In " Pascal ": 

" There are moments of one's own life, aspects of 
the life of others, of which the conclusion that the will 
is free seems to be the only is the natural or reason- 
able account. Yet those very moments on reflexion, 
on second thoughts, present themselves again, as but 
links in a chain, in an all-embracing network of chains. 
In all education we assume, in some inexplicable com- 
bination, at once the freedom and the necessity of the 
subject of it. And who on a survey of life from out- 
side would willingly lose the dramatic contrasts, the 
alternating interests, for which the opposed ideas of 
freedom and necessity are our respective points of view ? 
How significant become the details we might other- 
wise pass by almost unobserved, but to which we are 
put on the alert by the abstract query whether a man 
be indeed a freeman or a slave, as we watch from aside 
his devious course, his struggles, his final tragedy or 
triumph. So much value at least there may be in prob- 
lems insoluble in themselves, such as that great con- 
troversy of Pascal's day between Jesuit and Jansenist." 
(Pp. 55, 56.) 

The difference between these two extracts may 
in varying degree be perceived between all 
Pater's earlier work and the greater part at 
least of his later. It is an interesting differ- 
ence. It is not merely that in his early work 
the sentences are shorter, although this is doubt- 
less on the whole the case. Nor is it that the 
sentences are less complicated, or that there is 
more predication, although this also I suppose 
to be the case. The difference is probably as 
much in the thinking as in the writing. In 
the early passage we have a number of direct 
statements, carefully modified and limited it 
is true, but quite clear-cut and authoritative. 
Half a dozen generalizations are presented to the 
reader ; each of independent interest, although 
of course they are closely connected. But the 
later passage offers nothing of the sort. We 
have approximations to the right idea, second 
thoughts, assumptions, queries rather than ques- 
tions, personal experience, remarks, the whole

aiming to leave us in a state, not of certainty, 
but of prepossession. This is persuasion ; com- 
pared with this the early manner seems trench- 
ant. Certainly that little Oxford essay seems 
crude to those who have learned to like Mr. 
Pater's later writing. Its serried phalanx of sen- 
tences, each one stiff and rigid, sharp and pol- 
ished, like a spear stuck up in the air, strikes us 
a little harshly. And yet, although it may be 
crude, it is not so very different from a much 
finer and more familiar piece of work which 
came not so long afterward, the Conclusion * to 
" The Renaissance." The style there is very 
definite and direct, one reason why people 
remember it better than Mr. Pater's later ut- 
terances. 

" Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is 
the end." 

" To burn always with this hard gem-like flame, to 
maintain this ecstasy, is success in life." 

" Not to discriminate every moment some passionate 
attitude in those about us ... is, in this short day of 
frost and sun, to sleep before evening." 

Compare such convictions with the " Essay on 
Style," fifteen years later : 

"In Pascal, for instance, in the persuasive writers 
generally, how difficult to define the point where, from 
time to time, argument which, if it is to be worth any- 
thing at all, must consist of facts or groups of facts, be- 
comes a pleading a theorem no longer, but essentially 
an appeal to the reader to catch the writer's spirit, 
to think with him, if one can or will an expression 
no longer of fact but of his sense of it, his peculiar in- 
tuition of a world prospective, or discerned below the 
faulty conditions of the present, in either case changed 
somewhat from the actual world." 

Such a change in the mode of expression might 
very possibly indicate nothing more than a 
change of intention, a desire to get closer to 
the real current of our thought, to approxi- 
mate more nearly to the actual forms of our 
speech. Such doubtless it was, there are 
many evidences of the endeavor, too many to 
cite here, but comparing it with some other 
considerations, it seems as though this change 
in the mode of expression must have been the 
outward indication of a change in the way of 
thinking. A change in a man's way of think- 
ing, of looking at things, is nothing extraordi- 
nary ; it is, on the other hand, almost a neces- 
sity, especially in the case in question. Mr. 
Pater never acquiesced, to put it as he put it 
himself, in a facile orthodoxy of his own. A

tion of the fact, if it be such. But there are one or two 
minor errors in that bibliography, and it may be that the

writer in " The Quarterly Review " for last 
July spends some time in commenting on Mr. 
Pater's " recantation," as he calls it ; and cer- 
tainly the tone of " Marius " is not the tone of 
the conclusion to " The Renaissance." It is 
hardly right to speak here of recantation ; some 
years after writing " Marius " Mr. Pater re- 
stored the omitted conclusion to its former 
place. But although he desired to stand to his 
old views, there need be no doubt that the 
" Conclusion " did not fully express his then 
position ; one sees readily enough, on reading 
it along with the chapters in " Marius " which 
express the same matter (chapters viii., ix.), 
that there has been a change. The same sources, 
the same ideas, the same conclusions ; and yet 
the temper is wholly different. Whatever ideal 
of a way of life is put forward in that " Con- 
clusion " had evidently, by the time of " Ma- 
rius," been, not rejected probably, but left be- 
hind. Mr. Pater, never holding that any con- 
viction was ultimate, had got beyond his earlier 
view. He had doubtless developed somewhat 
in ten years ; strange if he had not. 

As to where he found himself, there is a little 
evidence, though not of the most definite char- 
acter. The development of the thinking and 
feeling of Marius is something of an indication. 
But if we pass by for the moment the possibil- 
ity of deductions from this particular piece of 
fiction, and look about us for other evidence 
of Mr. Pater's ideas at this time, we come at 
once to the " Imaginary Portraits." Of these, 
four were published not long after " Marius "; 
the present volume gives us three more. One 
of these last was written in 1878, the two others 
much later. Of all seven, none bear the stamp 
of autobiographic feeling more than do " The 
Child in the House " and "Sebastian van 
Storck," of which the latter is more to our 
present purpose. In " Sebastian van Storck " 
we have a young man who, by hard thinking, 
had carefully elaborated a way of life for him- 
self, and was come finally to an attempt to put 
it in practice. We need not suppose that the 
particular line of thought in question had ever 
been Mr. Pater's own (although there is a far- 
away echo in " Emerald Uthwart "), but we 
may perhaps believe that there was something 
reminiscent in the general situation. To think 
out carefully a way of life, and to try to walk 
in it, this is the story of Sebastian, and of 
Marius, and possibly enough of Mr. Pater him- 
self. But then, in the case of Sebastian we 
have the sudden sweeping on of a logic beyond 
the timid assurances of reason, and the man is

hurried out of his carefully arranged life into 
an act of self-sacrifice which brings about his 
death. It was something that he had not fore- 
seen, had not deduced from his premises ; and 
yet it was harmonious, almost syllogistic, right. 
So also was it with Marius. Prepared as he 
was for Christianity, by many thoughts and 
infinite feeling, it needed the pressure of ex- 
ternal events to carry him out of his own circle 
of reasoning into the self-sacrifice which left 
him dead with those who had long been his 
brothers in the spirit and his sisters. It would 
be hardly right to attempt to go further, but 
all reading of Mr. Pater's later work tends to 
make one believe that he was himself advanc- 
ing from the ground on which he had once felt 
secure, advancing cautiously, slowly, always 
testing his foothold, and yet always with a 
presentment that there might at any time, and 
that suddenly, come to pass something that 
should knock from his hand the staff with 
which he groped and snatch him swiftly into 
the splendor of convincing and glorious light. 
The particular point which he had reached is 
as well indicated as we need expect in some of 
his later writings let us say, in the first and 
last chapters of "Plato and Platonism." In 
this last volume there are slight hints in the 
essay on Pascal. 

Such as it may have been this conception 
of a way of life, of Mr. Pater's later thought 
we are always feeling ourselves near it when 
we turn to the group of distinguished and im- 
aginative characters which form so attractive 
a part of his later work. These young men, 
Marius, Hippolytus, Duke Carl, Emerald Uth- 
wart, and the others, have not a few points in 
common which readers of Mr. Pater will easily 
think of ; but perhaps especially this, that each 
one was something of a stranger to the world 
he lived in, separated from it invisibly, though 
effectively, by the veil-like cloud of his own 
eager or intense feeling and thinking. Each 
one was influenced by surroundings, but the 
vital principle was always within. Of some of 
the " Imaginary Portraits " can this be said 
less properly than of others, quite properly, 
however, of Emerald Uthwart, whose story now 
appears for the first time in book form. It has 
almost as much charm of circumstance as Denys 
1'Auxerrois. The curiously unreal story is told 
with such a certainty of human touch that one 
lingers in the exquisite surroundings, to the neg- 
lect at first of the character itself. And yet just 
now it is of the boy Emerald himself that one 
would think the ideal of the pure, beautiful 



youth which Mr. Pater loved, which he has by 
other ways than by direct portrait presented to 
us ; and the early life, the school life, of Emer- 
ald is quite representative of the moods, the 
temper, that we have in mind. Deprived some- 
how of the natural, the hereditary freedom that 
seemed his right, he honestly, even submis- 
sively, gave himself up to the influences and 
requirements of his school-days ; the result be- 
ing, as with Marius or Hippolytus, a life of 
happy, loyal, and unconscious preparation for 
an unknown end, which when it came was un- 
expected, at first incomprehensible, and always 
wholly noble. A sort of cultivation ascesis, 
as he so often called it submissive, self-re- 
strained, open to all good impressions, such, so 
far as we can judge from the matter as well as 
the manner of Mr. Pater's more recent work, 
was the result into which the Epicureanism of 
the " Conclusion " might very possibly have de- 
veloped. By no means self-indulgence, not even 
self-cultivation merely : it was rather a kind of 
expectant self-development, a recognition of 
duty, of responsibility, a feeling of the need of 
preparation ; of preparation for what we are 
nowhere informed, and it would be almost a 
mean curiosity for us to inquire. If Mr. Pater 
had written an autobiography, we might doubt- 
less know. As he has reserved his opinions on 
the matter, we may well enough be content with 
the assurance of our own. 

In reading a book like this, published after 
the death of an author one values, one is 
tempted to think more of the man himself than 
of these particular pieces of his work. And 
so I have been led to neglect the two reminis- 
cences of Mr. Pater's earlier work the papers 
on Raphael and Art in Northern Italy ; as well 
as the beginning of a new vein the studies of 
the Cathedral of Amiens and the monastic 
church of Vezelay. There is also the lecture 
on Merimee, besides the others I have noted, 
all making up a collection, miscellaneous cer- 
tainly, as in the painfully prosaic name (which 
we may hope is due to Mr. Shadwell), but as 
certainly representative. It is hardly to be 
thought that the book will much enhance the 
reputation of its author, but it will make evi- 
dent once again that nothing of Mr. Pater's 
fell much under his best. It needs no com- 
ment nor praise ; it is ripe and beautiful work, 
and with " Greek Studies " offers a fitting ex- 
ample of the range and quality of one who has 
for some time been recognized as among the 
most distinguished and characteristic men of 
letters of our day. EDWARD E. HALE, JR.

A NEW HISTORY or EDUCATION.* 



No man who uses the English language as 
a medium of thought has done more to give 
education a definite status as a science and an 
art, and particularly as a university study, than 
Professor Laurie of Edinburgh. To justify this 
opinion, it is sufficient on his side to mention 
his " Institutes of Education," " Occasional 
Addresses on Educational Subjects," " Life of 
Comenius," "Training of the Teacher," " Eise 
and Early Constitution of Universities," " Pri- 
mary Instruction," " Teacher's Guild Ad- 
dresses," "Language and Linguistic Method," 
and the present " Historical Survey of Pre- 
Christian Education," which is much the most 
valuable, as it is much the largest and most 
pretentious, work of all. We do not, in fact, 
recall a single writer of this class who can point 
to a series of equally valuable pedagogical writ- 
ings. His inaugural address on the " Training 
of Teachers " still remains the best vindication 
of the Chair of Education. 

Before the philosophical student of educa- 
tion has finished the Introduction (pp. 8) of 
" Pre-Christian Education," he discovers that 
its author has seized the right point of view. 
Education is not a fact to be studied by itself. 
It does not stand apart, separate, unrelated, 
and alone. It is an outgrowth of ideas, phil- 
osophies, religions, and institutions. It is re- 
lated to race and national character, and to the 
spirit of the time. It is an integral part of 
the surrounding civilization. The education 
that is furnished in the schools of any country 
at any time may profoundly affect the culture, 
the sentiments, the institutions, the learning, 
the mental and moral character, of ensuing gen- 
erations ; but is itself shaped and inspired by 
the existing factors that fall into these several 
categories. Hence, such education may be con- 
ceived under two aspects : As a result or pro- 
duct of the past or existing culture, and as a 
factor or cause of the coming culture. Human 
history is continuous, human society homogen- 
eous ; and no characteristic social fact relig- 
ion, government, or education can be under- 
stood if torn away from its connections. It 
must be studied in situ. Such fact is part and 
parcel of the whole life of the people. Edu- 
cational facts and ideas, therefore, must be 
taken along with philosophical, social, religious,

History of Education in the University of Edinburgh, etc.

industrial, scientific, and political facts and 
ideas. They all sustain to one another the re- 
lation of mutual cause and effect. Hence no 
intelligent student of the history of education 
will take up the education of any age or coun- 
try as a separate or distinct subject. He will 
search out its antecedents will inquire into 
what soil of culture it strikes its roots. 

And this last is what Professor Laurie does. 
He begins with telling us that " the history of 
education is involved in the general history of 
the world. No adequate survey of it is possi- 
ble which does not presume a considerable ac- 
quaintance with the history of the leading races 
which have occupied and subdued the earth, 
and formed themselves into civilized societies." 
This is raising the history of education at once 
to the rank and dignity of philosophy ; it is 
spreading it over a large part of the territory 
to which the phrase " History of Civilization " 
is ordinarily applied. But, lest his theme es- 
cape him, owing to its very vastness, he limits 
its field, as follows : 

" For by education, even in the narrow sense in which 
the word must be employed here, I understand the 
means which a nation, with more or less consciousness, 
takes for bringing up its citizens to maintain the tradi- 
tion of national character, and for promoting the wel- 
fare of the whole as an organized ethical community. 
It is essential, therefore, that we should understand the 
objects which the nation, as such, desired to secure; in 
brief, its own more or less conscious ideal of national 
and civic life, of personal character, and political jus- 
tice. If we can ascertain this by the study of its highest 
products in men, deeds, and arts, we have made a great 
step towards interpreting the course of training through 
which it would naturally endeavor to subject its youth 
by means of its laws and institutions." 

Starting from this base - line, Professor 
Laurie divides his subject into four grand 
divisions : The Hamitic race, confined wholly 
to Egypt (pp. 37); the Semitic races, Arabs, 
Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, and He- 
brews (pp. 50); the Uro- Altaic or Turanian 
races, limited to China (pp. 52); the Aryan 
or Indo-European races, embracing India and 
the Hindus, the Medo-Persians, the Hellenic 
peoples, and the Romans (pp. 271). Again in 
the last division 230 pages are assigned to the 
Greeks and Romans alone ; and when we re- 
flect oh the fuller educational development of 
these people, the far richer literary memorials 
they left behind them, and the transcendent 
influence they have exerted upon subsequent 
history, we cannot say this assignment is dis- 
proportionate. So far from slighting the peo- 
ples of Egypt and Asia, Professor Laurie has 
rather sought to do them fullest justice ; and, 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



283 



in a sense, the most interesting and valuable 
parts of his books are the parts in which he 
has described their education. The educations 
of Greece and of Rome have been the not un- 
frequent themes of able writers ; Israel and 
China also have received considerable atten- 
tion ; but the educations of Egypt, India, the 
Arabs, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Phreni- 
cians have been obscure topics, and informa- 
tion could only be picked up, at least by En- 
glish readers, here and there. Professor Laurie 
has made diligent search for material in pre- 
paring these sections of his work, and if he has 
found little, the reason is that there is little to 
find. Such as exists he has brought together 
and presented in a clear and interesting man- 
ner, not failing to connect the outward facts 
with some of the inner ideas from which they 
have sprung. The accounts of the Hebrew 
and Chinese educations also are well done. We 
could, indeed, criticise the handling of all the 
Oriental educations in one important feature. 
The writer has not sought, as he might have 
done, for the grand underlying Oriental ideas, 
as repose, conservatism, love of decoration, 
ceremony, and propension to " wisdom," which 
have given to these educations a certain unmis- 
takable cast, making them non-scientific, but lit- 
erary, religious, and rich in prudential teaching. 
For the field that it covers, the work is far 
more satisfactory in treatment than any other 
with which we are acquainted ; and we are glad 
to recommend it strongly, not merely to teachers 
and students of education, but to scholars and 
cultivated men generally. We have noticed 
no indication of a purpose on the part of the 
author to carry his work farther. The contact of 
Christianity and the Grseco-Roman education, 
involving the obscurantist tendencies of the 
Church, the appearance of the first Christian 
schools, and the final establishment of an equi- 
librium between the new religion and mental 
cultivation, is a great theme that still awaits a 
competent writer to handle it. Before he sends 
out a second edition of the present work, Dr. 
Laurie will no doubt reconstruct this sentence : 
" In the Egyptians this race of mankind [the 
Hamitic] found the highest expression of its 
capacity for civilized life, as did the Hebrews 
among the Semites, the Chinese among the 
Uro- Altaic (Turanian), and the Greeks among 
the Aryans." R A> HINSDALE.

Canadian copyright muddle is that by Professor Gold- 
win Smith, in " The Canadian Magazine." 



THE STORY OF SIR SAMUEL, BAKER.* 

The conditions which developed in Sir Sam- 
uel Baker the restless energy of the explorer 
are readily recognized. The old Saxon wander- 
love had made many generations of the Bakers 
sea-rovers like Hawkins and Frobisher, owning 
and fighting their ships : his father had, as a 
privateersman, won a gallant victory against 
the French in his own sloop, the " Ca3sar." 
He came to his majority with a fair education, 
a liberal inheritance which relieved him from 
any claims of business, and an engrossing spirit 
of adventure. 

After an early and a happy marriage, he went 
first to the Mauritius to look after some pater- 
nal estates, and, following a brief sojourn there, 
to Ceylon for the sport of shooting the big 
game then abundant on that island. Here he 
became so fascinated with the beauty of the 
scenery, and. so impressed with the alluring 
opportunities offered to the settler, that he 
founded a sort of feudal colony, at a place called 
Newera Eliya, rather more than a hundred 
miles from Colombo. The enterprise was suc- 
cessful, but after a term of years inroads upon 
his health compelled Baker to return to En- 
gland. An account of this enterprise, under 
the title " Eight Years' Wanderings in Ceylon," 
was published in 1855. 

In 1861 Baker was inspired with the pur- 
pose of exploring the sources of the Nile. The 
geography of Equatorial Africa had already 
been attacked from several quarters. The prob- 
lem of the Niger had been solved. The tradi- 
tions concerning a vast interior lake had been 
more than verified, as two great lakes had been 
determined. Speke and Grant were already 
prosecuting the journey which would demon- 
strate the Victoria Nyanza to be the reservoir 
of the White Nile ; while Livingstone was at 
work upon the territory farther south and east. 
The Blue Nile was known ; that the White Nile 
was the outlet of the Victoria Nyanza was an 
accepted theory rather than a demonstrated 
fact, the objective of expeditions already afield. 
The sources of the western tributaries of the 
great river had not yet been determined, and 
to these points Baker addressed himself. 

His first essay was an exploration of terri- 
tory already fairly known, where he carefully 
mapped the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia, and 
served his apprenticeship for severer labors.

an exploration of the upper Nile. After two 
months he met Speke and Grant, who were 
tracing northward the outlet of the Nyanza, 
and so much of the determination was com- 
pleted. Pushing his own expedition still far- 
ther to the southward, he broke into new terri- 
tory which he traversed under great difficulties, 
until after the toil of a year he was rewarded 
by the discovery of the Albert Nyanza, then 
believed to be second of the great Nile reser- 
voirs. The subsequent discovery by Stanley 
of the Albert Edward Nyanza, a smaller body 
of water at a greater elevation, whose waters 
flow through the Albert lake, has recognized 
in the more elevated lake the second source of 
the Nile. With the finding of the Albert Ny- 
anza, Baker's labors as a discoverer were sub- 
stantially closed. 

The second great enterprise undertaken by 
Sir Samuel Baker was at the instance of Ismail 
Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, and with the au- 
thority of the Egyptian government ; it was the 
herculean task of suppressing the slave-trade 
within the jurisdiction of Egypt. 

The year 1869 saw the inauguration of the 
Suez Canal, and the high tide of apparent 
Egyptian prosperity. The eyes of the world 
were upon the rejuvenated kingdom of the 
Pharaohs. The Khedive, dazzled by the achieve- 
ment, aspired to be an independent ruler, to 
obtain command of all the territory tributary to 
the Nile, and to acquire a place in the charmed 
circle of European rulers. He leaned upon the 
strong arm of England ; and to secure the sym- 
pathy of that mighty power, he proposed to 
destroy the trade in slaves in all his realm. As 
a step toward the accomplishment of these pur- 
poses, in May, 1869, he issued a firman in which 
he proposed to subdue the countries about the 
great Equatorial lakes, to suppress the slave- 
trade, and to introduce a system of commerce 
and the navigation of the lakes. The enter- 
prise was entrusted to Sir Samuel Baker for 
four years ; he was made a Pasha, given the 
rank of Major-General, and was clothed with 
supreme and absolute power, including that of 
death, over all connected with his expedition. 

Like every other scheme for real progress, 
proposed by Egyptian or Turk, the only val- 
idity of these propositions lay in their paper 
announcements. Men and materials were want- 
ing either in quantity or quality suited to the 
enterprise. The real question was how not to 
do it. The slave-trade was to be suppressed, 
but the slave-trader, and his powerful and sub- 
sidized friends at court, were not to be hurt. 



The land was a land of paradox, and the labor 
was the task of Sisyphus. 

With such means as he could get, Baker 
moved to the scene of operations. He occupied 
Gondokoro, the farthest important point toward 
the south, and made it his capital and base of 
operations, with the new name Ismailia. He 
made friends with some of the chiefs in the 
country beyond ; others he coerced into a pre- 
tense of friendship. Then he fought his way 
southward, and after a continuous and harrass- 
ing campaign he placed under subjection the 
whole territory assigned as the theatre of his 
operations. By then the period named in his 
commission had expired, and he returned to 
Cairo, where he transferred his command to 
one whom he himself had named as his suc- 
cessor, that remarkable figure in modern En- 
glish history, Colonel Gordon, of Chinese and 
afterward of Egyptian fame. 

In the four years of Baker's administration 
of the Equatorial provinces he had accom- 
plished scarcely more than to lay the founda- 
tions of Egyptian authority, with the subjec- 
tion of the native tribes. Commerce, except 
the united movement of ivory and slaves, could 
follow only a more advanced civilization. The 
slave-trade was a disease of the social system, 
as fixed and as fatal as the leprosy which has 
once fastened its fangs upon the human frame. 
None of these objects assigned to his enterprise 
could be established in the brief period of four 
years, even under favorable auspices. Could 
his strong hand and vigorous intellect have 
ruled during a period of longer duration, the 
result would have been more nearly commen- 
surate with the effort. 

Baker's commission expired in 1873 ; Gor- 
don's followed in 1874, and lasted until 1879. 
During that period, great changes occurred in 
Egypt. The golden era of Ismail passed, and 
Tewfik followed his deposed father. War pitted 
the Russian against the Turk. England came 
to the succor of the " sick man," taking Cyprus 
for a doctor's fee, and postponing all dreams 
of Egyptian independence. To secure the 
debts incurred by Ismail's extravagance, Egypt 
passed under the dual control of the English 
and French ; Arabi revolted ; the bombard- 
ment of Alexandria was followed by the cam- 
paign in the desert, and the victory at Tel-el- 
Kebir. The fanaticism of the Moslem and 
the Bedouin was aroused, and an insurrection 
under the leadership of a self-styled prophet, 
the Mahdi, spread like a pestilence until it had 
involved the whole of Soudan and of the Equa-

torial provinces which Baker and Gordon had 
so laboriously subjugated. 

In 1884 Gordon was sent back to Khartum 
as one whose person and prestige could repeat 
in the Soudan what they had effected in China. 
Neglected by Egypt and abandoned by Eng- 
land, in 1885 he sealed with his life a devo- 
tion which was ill compensated by the bronze 
effigy quickly placed in St. Paul's to typify a 
nation's contrition. 

During these stirring times, Sir Samuel 
Baker was rather a looker-on than an active 
participant. His comments upon the affairs 
of Egypt and the East, based upon the full 
familiarity of long experience, were more fre- 
quently words of criticism than of approval. 
He passed away in January of 1894. 

He was a stalwart, self-contained English- 
man ; a mighty hunter ; a clear writer ; an in- 
telligent organizer, and an efficient executive, 
a noble specimen of a worthy race.

THE CONCLUSION OF BAIRD'S HISTORY 
OF THE HUGUENOTS.* 

In his two volumes on " The Huguenots and 
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes," Pro- 
fessor Baird has drawn up a severe indictment 
of France for her dealings with the Hugue- 
nots during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. There is no sin of the Gallican 
church or of the Bourbon monarchy which is 
not adequately stated and the degree of its 
enormity marked by an appropriate adjective. 
The conclusion is inevitable that the French 
clergy were largely engaged in the despicable 
business of hounding Louis XIV. on to the 
destruction of thousands of his most loyal and 
industrious subjects, and that by yielding to their 
solicitations he proved himself to be an igno- 
ble, if not a stupid, tyrant. This has long been 
the Protestant, and, with certain modifications, 
the general view of the matter. Professor Baird 
has, however, elaborated it in greater detail 
and with more ample scholarship. The story 
which he tells is at times sombre, and even a 
little dreary, as all recitals of hapless struggle 
against injustice, oppression, and hypocrisy 
must be. It is not until the period of the 
Camisard War and the Church of the Desert

OF NANTES. By Henry M. Baird, Professor in the Univer- 
sity of the City of New York. Two volumes. New York : 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 



is reached that one is reminded of his books on 
the brighter fortunes of the Huguenot move- 
ment in the sixteenth century. 

Professor Baird would have made these ca- 
lamitous chapters of French history more intel- 
ligible had he looked at them in a more philo- 
sophic spirit and less as the special advocate of 
the Huguenot party. Even the bigotry which 
in our eyes cursed the later administration of 
the Great King was not as mean as an unsym- 
pathetic chronicle would make it appear. Its 
principal consequence was the persecution of 
the Huguenots, and this was neither wholly 
Louis's work nor the work of his clergy. Sainte- 
Beuve told at least a part of the truth when, 
long ago, he declared that the King was insen- 
sibly urged on to this terrible blunder by a 
complicity almost universal. It is idle to deny 
this when we know that an overwhelming ma- 
jority of the French people believed that the Cal- 
vinistic heresy not merely imperilled the eter- 
nal salvation of those who cherished it, but also 
endangered by its contagion every community 
in France. Had the religious leaders of France 
acquiesced in the schism legalized by the Edict 
of Nantes, their conduct would have seemed to 
us incredible, or at least very puzzling. The 
seventeenth century produced few such un- 
timely prophets of forbearance. In the Pala- 
tinate, a near neighbor of France, twice within 
sixty years the inhabitants had been forced to 
embrace the doctrines of Luther, and twice to 
give them up for those of Calvin, in obedience 
to that holy principle of the Religious Peace of 
Augsburg, cujus regio, ejus religio. England 
was driving the " Papists " to despair and Gun- 
powder plots by her Recusancy laws, the most 
genial of which provided that Catholics who re- 
fused to go to church should pay a fine of X20 
a month. Necessitous Protestant gentlemen 
of a sensitive piety found some temporal advan- 
tage in this particular statute, as, for exam- 
ple, Lord Hay, who received fi-om the govern- 
ment a grant of all he could get over 240 
from one of the Recusants. In comparison 
with her neighbors, France was until past the 
middle of the century a land of " sweetness and 
light." What the King and his ecclesiastical 
councillors did after 1656 is not surprising, 
although it may fill the modern man with an- 
ger and disgust. But if he be a historian he 
sacrifices the true interests of his readers when 
he leaves the bench and assumes the role of 
prosecuting attorney to plead against one cul- 
prit after another, not forgetting men like Bos- 
suet and Fenelon.

[Nov. 16, 



The Edict of Nantes had been a glorious 
achievement in spite of the fact that it did not 
embody a policy of toleration of the modern 
sort, but was rather the recognition of privi- 
leges, half religious and half political, won in 
battle. It was not a stable peace, and conse- 
quently, although it was ostensibly " irrevoca- 
ble " and needed no confirming, Louis XIII. 
and Louis XIV. repeatedly confirmed it. One 
of these confirmations, which occurred in 1629 
and has been called the Edict of Grace, came 
nearer to a true toleration than did the Edict 
of Nantes itself, for it was granted after the 
political defeat of the Huguenots and the fall of 
La Rochelle, the last of their great strongholds 
when, therefore, no serious threat of insur- 
rection held the government to its pledges. 
From this time to 1656, and perhaps a few 
years later, the Huguenots throve, protected 
by the wise statesmanship of Richelieu and 
Mazarin. Their constant troubles before 1629 
were quite as much due to the abnormal posi- 
tion like a state within a state which the 
original Edict had given them, as to any hos- 
tile intentions on the part of the Regent or 
Louis XIII. The possession of one hundred 
and fifty fortified places was, indeed, less a 
guarantee of the good faith of the government 
than an evidence of its weakness, the result 
of the disastrous civil wars, when feudalism 
sought to rebuild its fortresses and when the 
mediaeval spirit of local independence threat- 
ened the disintegration of France. But the 
royal power was to triumph, and with its 
triumph the exceptional position of the Hugue- 
nots shared the fate of the new feudalism. If 
we forget the political aspect of the affair, it 
is hard to understand why the Huguenot lead- 
ers enlisted Catholic soldiers, who were cer- 
tainly strange partners in the defense of lib- 
erty of conscience for heretics ; or why that 
" unfortunate convocation," to use Professor 
Baird's phrase, the Assembly of La Rochelle 
in 1621, carried its factiousness so far as to 
give its adherents an organization which might 
easily have passed for that of a new Protest- 
ant state modelled after the Dutch Republic. 
Up to 1629 the situation is so complex, there- 
fore, that the issue is not clearly between op- 
pressor and oppressed, and the story must be 
read with divided sympathies. 

It was a great misfortune that the Edict of 
Nantes proved to be only a little more irrevo- 
cable than the " perpetual and irrevocable " 
edict of Queen Jeanne d'Albret in 1563, 
granting toleration in Beam to Catholics, 



which "perpetual" edict lasted eight years. 
For two decades before 1685, when the Revo- 
cation came, the spirit of the great edict had 
been disobeyed, its letter misinterpreted, and 
its object thwarted by the wholesale destruc- 
tion of churches, by the " conversion fund," 
the suppression of Huguenot representation on 
the bench, and by the infamous Dragonnades. 
Indeed, Louis XIV. seems to have thought 
that the formal Revocation was simply the fit- 
ting conclusion to a noble work of Christian 
reunion, already practically complete. 

Professor Baird has one or two interesting 
passages describing the exemplary morals of 
the murderous Camisards. " No quarrels, en- 
mity, calumny, or thieving was heard among 
us," says one of their leaders, Cavalier. "All 
swearing, cursing, and obscene words were 
quite banished out of our society. Happy time ! 
had it lasted forever." But it is not strange, 
perhaps, considering the horrible cruelties that 
were practiced upon them, that their experi- 
ence made the naive combination of these minor 
virtues with the most pitiless butcheries. 

It would have been not out of place had 
Professor Baird given us a fuller description 
of the fortunes of the Church of the Desert 
and its pastors during the storms of the Revo- 
lution. In what he writes, however, about the 
Triumph of Atheism, he falls into the error of 
saying that the Convention ordered the sup- 
pression of all religious worship. The day be- 
fore Gobel's abdication, the Convention had, 
it is true, voted that communes could suppress 
their parishes if they desired, subject to the 
approval of the departments in which they were 
situated. Nine days later it added the pro- 
vision that the suppressed churches or their 
income be used for hospitals or for public in- 
struction. It never went so far as to sepa- 
rate church from state, or to render worship 
illegal. 

Even if Professor Baird's attitude toward 
the French clergy in urging the Revocation be 
open to just criticism, the careful scholarship 
and ripe learning, of which all his pages give 
evidence, make these volumes a fitting conclu- 
sion to the great work on Huguenot history to 
which he has devoted the thirty best years of 

his life - HENRY E. BOURNE.

THE CHAUTAUQUA BOOKS.* 

The reading required of Chautauquans for 
the coming year consists of five books, two of 
them, at least, being departures from the con- 
ventional lines upon which the preceding series 
of manuals have been planned. Experimental 
psychology and anthropology are, to say the 
least, novel elements in a scheme of popular 
instruction, but the growing importance of both 
sciences seems to justify their inclusion. The 
remaining books are devoted to American po- 
litical and industrial history, and to American 
letters. As all these books are sure of a wide 
circulation and a considerable degree of influ- 
ence, they call for a somewhat closer scrutiny 
than their intrinsic importance might warrant. 

Professor E. W. Scripture's work on " Think- 
ing, Feeling, Doing " for thus he entitles his 
popular treatise on the psychology of the lab- 
oratory is an interesting and unusually read- 
able volume, and the author does not, perhaps, 
claim too much for it when he calls it " the 
first book on the new, or experimental, psy- 
chology written in the English language." To 
the reader who knows something of psychology, 
but who has failed to keep up with the modern 
developments of the science in its narrow lab- 
oratory aspect, the book cannot fail to prove 
helpful and instructive. To the beginner, on 
the other hand, who is without the psycholog- 
ical standards necessary for comparison and 
evaluation, it is sure to prove misleading and 
mischievous in effect. Its main contention is 
the foolish one that psychology is essentially a 
science of quantitative experiment, and that 
its modern laboratory wing is the only part of 
the structure deserving of serious considera- 
tion. In many insidious ways is this impres- 
sion made and deepened, while the writer 
misses no opportunity to allude in terms of dis- 
paragement to the psychology of introspection. 
To anyone who knows what the science of psy- 
chology is, and how little of real value has thus 
far been contributed to its development by lab- 
oratory methods, who knows how tentative and 
imperfectly formulated those methods are, the 
attitude of the present writer will be merely 
amusing; but most of his readers, unfortu- 
nately, will be found among a class of people 
little disposed to be critical, and unable to see

how shallow are the pretensions he sets forth. 
A typical illustration of Professor Scripture's 
attitude is provided by the following note : 
" There are so-called ' qualitative sciences ' that 
have no methods of measurement or statistics. 
These are the demireps of the scientific world 
with whom we must put up because we have n't 
more respectable members of society to take 
their places." It is easy to dispose of ethical, 
economical, political, and social science to 
say nothing of the greater part of psychology 
in this airy way, but it is also cheap, and 
not exactly creditable to a thinker who wants 
to be taken seriously. 

Professor Scripture's book is, for the most 
part, a description of experiments, some of which 
are well-fitted for the kindergarten, while others 
call for such adjuncts as sesthesiometers, olf acto- 
meters, and sphygmographs. It is sprightly in 
style, and abundantly supplied with illustrative 
cuts. An example of the experiments may be 
given. " With the thumb-and-finger-grip the 
greatest pressure I can exert during silence is 
eight pounds. When someone plays the giants' 
motive from the Rheingold my grip shows eight 
and three-fourths pounds. The slumber motive 
from the Walkiire reduces the power to seven 
and one-half pounds." This description is illus- 
trated by cuts of the two motives in musical 
notation. What we would say of this experi- 
ment, and of all experiments of its general 
class, is simply that the quantitative fact 
which to the author is the fact of most import- 
ance is in reality of trifling value, and that 
the only fact of real significance is the qualita- 
tive one of increased or decreased stimulation 
with the change in tempo and tone-color. We 
do not wish to minify the value of exact meas- 
urements in any department of investigation, 
but we do claim that in a case like this the 
general statement made long before psycho- 
logical laboratories were invented is of far 
greater importance to the science of psychology. 
Professor Scripture, on the other hand, seems 
to regard the determination of his own thumb- 
and-finger-grip, or, at any rate, of an average 
from a number of cases, as more important 
than the general law of stimulation, qualita- 
tively stated. 

In his closing chapter, on " The New Psy- 
chology," the author takes a final whack at the 
" vague observation, endless speculation, and 
flimsy guesswork " of such duffers as Locke 
and Hamilton. He tells us how the new order 
of things was started in Germany by Herbart, 
continued by Fechner, Weber, and Helmholtz,

and made triumphant by Herr Wundt, " the 
greatest of psychologists." He tells us how 
psychology has at last been rescued from " the 
lingering clutch of philosophy," which has 
" contributed nothing but stumbling-blocks " 
in aid of the new emancipated science. All of 
this is so entertaining that we owe its author a 
final word of thanks. In a more serious sense, 
we may be thankful to him for the pronounce- 
ment that " hypnotic exhibitions," " thought- 
transference follies," and " the so-called psy- 
chical research experiments " are " as unrelated 
to scientific experiments, as clairvoyant healing 
or faith-cure to the science of medicine." His 
suggestions for an improved musical notation 
are also of value, and deserve to be taken into 
practical consideration. A curious error (page 
72) gives a certain angle as 325 instead of 
315, and is repeated no less than five times. 
A quotation of several pages from Herr Wundt 
is, we believe, taken from a recent English 
translation, but no credit is given, which is a 
transaction not entirely creditable to the bor- 
rower. 

The anthropological volume in this Chau- 
tauqua series is by Professor Frederick Starr, 
and is modestly entitled " Some First Steps in 
Human Progress." Strictly speaking, it is a 
resume of culture-history rather than of the 
larger science of anthropology, and, considered 
in relation to its restricted scope, is an admir- 
able piece of work. Indeed, we know of no 
other book which brings together, in a way 
both popular and accurate, the leading facts of 
culture-history, about which recent investiga- 
tion has disclosed so much, and recent theory 
done so much to coordinate. Among the many 
subjects pleasantly discussed in this element- 
ary treatise are fire-making, pottery, hunting, 
the domestication of animals and the cultiva- 
tion of plants, the life of the stone age, metal- 
working, weapons, gesture and speech, the be- 
ginnings of writing, marriage, and primitive 
religious observances. We have noted a few 
points that seem to call for criticism. To char- 
acterize the Japanese as " highly immoral and 
immodest " is a very daring thing to do, and 
we do not believe that the facts, broadly viewed, 
will bear out the opinion. The beginning of 
agriculture, which offers one of the great prob- 
lems of culture-history, is so discussed as to 
convey the idea that no problem worth speak- 
ing of exists. The common origin of peach 
and almond (considered as produced by human 
agency from a single stock) is at least ques- 
tionable, the weight of evidence being rather 



against such an hypothesis. Perhaps the most 
important criticism of the work to be made 
is that it does not, except by implication, em- 
phasize the great principle of uniformity of 
development in the different branches of the 
human family, the most salient general prin- 
ciple that has emerged from recent anthropo- 
logical study. Of .this principle, Professor 
Brinton, in his September address before the 
American Association at Springfield, spoke in 
emphatic terms, characterizing it as " a dis- 
covery little less than marvellous, the most 
pregnant of all that anthropology has yet of- 
fered, not yet appreciated even by the learned. 
The discovery is that of the psychical unity of 
man, the parallelism of his development every- 
where and in all time ; nay, more, the nigh ab- 
solute uniformity of his thoughts and actions, 
his aims and methods, when in the same de- 
gree of development, no matter where he is, or 
in what epoch living." So important a matter 
as this should occupy a conspicuous place in 
even the most elementary of works upon cul- 
ture-history. But these few criticisms are not 
intended to produce the impression that Pro- 
fessor Starr has made an unsatisfactory book. 
On the contrary, it is a strikingly satisfactory 
effort, considering its limitations, and is not 
only instructive but made entertaining by many 
bits of anecdote and folk-lore, to say nothing 
of such felicitous phrases as that which speaks 
of " the wild and unhappy disposition of the 
cat." The beginner in anthropology could not 
easily have a better introduction to that deeply 
interesting science. 

The third of the Chautauqua books is a his- 
tory of " The Industrial Evolution of the United 
States," by Mr. Carroll D. Wright, probably 
the most competent of all authorities on the sub- 
ject. It is an admirable book, packed with fig- 
ures and graphic presentments, yet highly read- 
able. It considers the colonial period of our 
industries at much length, then discusses the 
industrial evolution of our first century of na- 
tional existence, then presents a history of the 
labor movement, with special chapters on " La- 
bor Legislation " and " Historic Strikes," and 
finally reviews the influence of machinery on 
labor. The scientific aspects of the subject are 
set forth with fulness of knowledge, while the 
controversial aspects are discussed with sobri- 
ety and fairness to all sides. It would be dif- 
ficult to make a better book of its size upon 
this vastly important subject, or one more likely 
to conduce to clear thinking upon the indus- 
trial problems of the day.

Professor Harry Pratt Judson, in attempt- 
ing to sketch "The Growth of the American 
Nation " for this series of manuals, has had a 
task at once easy and difficult : easy, in that 
the task has called for no special investiga- 
tions, but merely for the marshalling of the 
undisputed elementary facts of our political his- 
tory ; difficult, in that so many other sketches 
of the sort have been written that it must have 
seemed almost hopeless to justify the existence 
of a new one. It is, however, justified, and 
amply, we should say, by the judicious selec- 
tion and arrangement of the materials, and by 
the breezy and attractive manner of the nar- 
rative. Breeziness, of course, sometimes leads 
to off-hand judgments that a close analysis 
would not support, and to turns of expression 
that a careful stylist would reject. These are 
the defects of the book's quality, which do not, 
however, much impair its usefulness for the 
class of readers to which it is addressed. The 
strength of the book is in its dealing with 
the period lying between our two great wars, 
the preceding and subsequent periods being 
accorded a relatively cursory treatment. 

The last of this set of books, and the least 
valuable, is by Professor Henry A. Beers, is 
called " Initial Studies in American Letters," 
and is the revised edition of "An Outline 
Sketch of American Literature," first pub- 
lished in 1887, and reissued under the present 
title in 1891. The author's judgment and 
sense of perspective may be illustrated by his 
coupling of " The Atlantic " with " Lippin- 
cott's " as " no unworthy competitors " with 
the popular picture-monthlies for public favor, 
or by his giving to Mr. James Whitcomb 
Riley six times the amount of space given to 
Sidney Lanier. The former bard, we are told, 
" has recently attained the rank of a really 
national poet." In trying to illustrate Ameri- 
can literature by a fifty-page appendix of ex- 
tracts, Professor Beers attempts what is sim- 
ply impossible.

INDIAN RELIGIONS.* 



Controversialist, popularizer, and scientific spe- 
cialist find the field of Indian religions attractive 
and productive enough to invite their activity and 
to warrant their putting forth books intended for 
the wider circle of intelligent readers. Mr. Maurice 
Phillips, author of " The Teaching of the Vedas," 
is a missionary of the London Mission, Madras, and 
his book presents and defends a thesis. He pro- 
pounds two questions: "(1) What is the funda- 
mental teaching of the Vedas ? and (2) What light 
does that teaching throw on the origin and develop- 
ment of religion?" And the answer is: "The 
theory of a primitive Divine Revelation alone is 
capable of explaining all the religious ideas of the 
Vedas.' ' Therefore Religion originated in a " Primi- 
tive Divine Revelation." The book shows the de- 
fects of its motive. There may be an honest search 
for truth, but the spectacles of the "P. D. R." 
aforesaid color all the endeavor. Vedic religion ia 
interpreted, not in its own light, but in that of or- 
thodox Christian theology. Professor Hopkins, in 
his bibliography, calls it "the work of a charlatan." 
This is hardly just. But Mr. Phillips is certainly 
an ignoramus in his facts and a partisan in his 
judgments. The book will enlighten nobody. 

" The Story of Vedic India " is from the hand 
of a skilful popularizer of somewhat recondite sub- 
jects. Mme. Ragozin's books on Chaldea, Assyria, 
and Media, in this same series, are useful compends 
of modern scholarship in the field of Oriental his- 
tory. India, as it is revealed in the Vedas, affords 
another excellent subject for her easy and graceful 
pen. The knowledge is reasonably exact and the 
picture fairly accurate. The writer claims nothing 
more than a wide and careful reading of good 
authorities. The average of errors committed by 
second-hand learning is always large, but the scholar 
at first-hand is not faultless. The book will serve 
the larger public by its vivid style, and by a kind 
of spirit and enthusiasm in the presentation which 
carry the reader along. 

The difficulties inherent in the subject are well 
illustrated in the admirable volume of Professor 
Hopkins on " The Religions of India." It is the 
first of a series of " Handbooks on the History of 
Religions," edited by Professor Morris Jastrow. 
The entire religious development of India is traced 
in these six hundred large and closely printed pages, 
by a scholar amply fitted for his task by philolog- 
ical training and knowledge of original authorities. 

But mark how this ample knowledge reveals the 
uncertainties that hang about Indology. Are the

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Vedic Gods nature deities or deified ancestors? Is 
the Kig Veda poetry of a primitive age, or is it sat- 
urated with sacerdotalism? Shall we interpret it 
according to the traditions of native commentators, 
in the light of Iranian and other kindred heliefs, or 
by itself, on the basis of modern scientific philol- 
ogy ? Such are the questions involving fundamen- 
tal points in but one age of Indian religion ; and 
they are samples of what meets the student at every 
stage of this religious development. 

India has no historical sense. Chronology is un- 
known. Literature is anonymous. The only pro- 
gress is in thought, if indeed progress can be traced 
even there. The student of religion in India must 
be philologian, philosopher, theologian, dreamer, lit- 
erary critic, man of insight and of common sense, 
if he would solve the puzzle of myth, ritual, poetry, 
symbolism, and speculation there presented. In 
view of this, it is hardly necessary to add that the 
ideal historian of India's religions will be a long 
time in coming. 

Meanwhile we have Professor Hopkins, and are 
grateful. For he has scholarship and common sense 
at any rate, and he has used these admirable qual- 
ities admirably. His book will be a classic. It will 
mould and stimulate study in this field. The pre- 
face modestly disclaims any purpose of instructing 
the professional indologist, but the best -trained 
scholars will find the book helpful. In general, it 
will bring to them the observations of a critical and 
full mind upon the present condition of studies in 
Indian religion. In particular, its contributions to 
the religious characteristics of the Epics will be en- 
lightening to them. The author has evidently made 
a special study of these writings. 

The general reader will, we fear, find Mr. Hop- 
kins a hard task-master. He takes too much for 
granted in the way of knowledge on the part of 
readers. There is too much allusion to recondite 
matters. The course of thought is often very ob- 
scure. Sentences are inverted ; parentheses are 
inserted with well-nigh unlimited freedom; con- 
structions are loose, and expressions as undignified 
as they are forcible not infrequently appear. The 
author claims to improve upon Earth's classic vol- 
ume on " The Religions of India," because, while 
the latter tells us all about these religions, our au- 
thor has sought to make the reader know these re- 
ligions themselves by presenting ample illustrative 
material. True, but the average reader will read 
Barth through with interest as well as profit, while, 
we fear, only a sense of duty will carry him to 
the end of this book. He will be fully repaid for 
the effort, however, and we only -regret that it is 
toward the end of his task that he will come upon 
the following admirable statement, which should 
have been placed at the beginning. It will give a 
good idea of the writer's insight and sanity. 

" In what, from a wider point of view, lies the im- 
portance of the study of Hindu religions ? Not, we 
venture to think, in their face value for the religious or 
philosophical life of the Occident, but in the revelation, 



which is made by this study, of the origin and growth 
of theistic ideas in one land; in the light these cast by 
analogy on the origin of such ideas elsewhere; iu the 
prodigious significance of the religious factor in the de- 
velopment of a race, as exhibited in this instance; in 
the inspiring review of that development as it is seen 
through successive ages in the loftiest aspirations of a 
great people; and finally in the lesson taught by the 
intellectual and religious fate of them among that peo- 
ple that have substituted, like the Brahman ritualist, 
form for spirit; like the Vedantist, ideas for ideals; 
like the sectary, emotion for morality. But greatest, 
if woeful, is the lesson taught by that phase of Bud- 
dhism which has developed into Lamaism and its kin- 
dred cults. For here one learns how few are they that 
can endure to be wise, how inaccessible to the masses 
is the height on which sits the sage, how unpalatable to 
the vulgar is a religion without credulity."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The best way to learn who were Pro- 
poet<taiaiiusion. m etheus and Hercules and Wotan 

and Siegfried, and other persons 
whom poets and painters are apt to deal with, is 
always to have known ; but there are a good many 
people who have not had this privilege. For such 
are provided an ever-increasing number of books, 
beginning with the works of the excellent Bullfinch, 
and ending up, at present, with Guerber's " Myths 
of Northern Lands " (American Book Co.) and 
Mooney's " Foundation Studies in Literature " (Sil- 
ver, Burdett, & Co.). These books are somewhat 
different in character as well as in subject-matter. 
The latter is a collection of modern poems contain- 
ing allusions to classical mythology or mediaeval 
legend, or else on subjects from those sources, with 
some explanation of the allusions, legends, and 
myths. It is a book which will be of use to those 
who have nothing better, but it is to be regretted 
that it gives no very definite notion of the subject 
which it treats. Greek mythology is not a very 
simple matter, and our generally learning to know 
it through the Latin and in Latin form does not 
make it simpler. A great help in writing about it 
is an acquaintance with the classical authors in the 
original. Such an acquaintance Miss Mooney may 
possess : it has not kept her, however, from such 
inaccuracies and confusions as giving Nox or Nyx 
as alternative Latin forms (p. 11), writing Selene 
without mention of the name Artemis (p. 33), writ- 
ing in the same legend Japetus (p. 61) and Okeanos 
(p. 64), and other such things. Rather quaint than 
otherwise is the idea of naming a consideration of 
Tennyson's " Dream of Fair Women" " The Origi- 
nal Sources of an Historical Poem," and the inser- 
tion of the poem between some remarks upon Ari- 
adne and others upon the days of the week. Mr. 
Guerber's book is of a much higher character, both 
in plan and execution. Having already published 
a volume in classic mythology, he has now turned

to the Teutonic myths, and has produced a very 
good popular handbook. He, too, offers illustra- 
tions from literature and art where they are to be 
found, but there are not enough allusions to the 
Norse in English literature to swamp him, so that 
the result is very satisfactory ; the work seems to 
be much more than a mere compilation. We pre- 
sume that the author would have something to say 
on the matter, but it appears unfortunate that no 
effort is made to clear the confusion which may 
well exist in the mind of the reader as to the Ger- 
man and Norse forms of the same story, and espe- 
cially of the same name, particularly as the stories 
in this book are usually from the Norse, while the 
pictures are apt to illustrate German forms. It 
would not have been difficult to explain the connec- 
tion between the names Odin, Woden, and Wuotan 
(p. 23), to which Wotan might well have been add- 
ed. The hearer of Wagner's operas or the reader 
of the Nibelungenlied might be expected to know 
that Sigurd is a corresponding form to Siegfried, 
but he might be puzzled about Gunnar, HOgni, Atli, 
and others. On page 260 the mention of Sigurd 
and Ermenrich within a few lines brings the mat- 
ter to an inconsistency. The same uncertainty may 
oppress the reader of another book by the same 
author, "The Legends of the Rhine" (A. S. Barnes 
& Co.) where the German names predominate. This 
book follows the Rhine from the North Sea to the 
Alps, and gathers together a great number of the 
legends of the places on the river. It is meant for 
travellers and for those who desire to secure the ad- 
vantages of travel without leaving home, and will 
be convenient for both classes of readers as well as 
for those who like legend and folk-lore. All three 
books are illustrated, the last profusely with good 
reproductions of paintings and photographs. 

In " The Spirit of Judaism " (Dodd, 
A Jewish view Mead & Co x Migs j osep hi n e Laza- 

of Judaism. , ' . JT"7 V ,, 

rus comprises a series of five thought- 
ful, eloquently written papers, the general tenor of 
which is indicated in their collective title. The 
author treats her theme from a broadly humani- 
tarian standpoint, urging upon her Jewish readers 
the need of giving heed to the promptings of that 
larger impulse by virtue of which the prophets and 
leaders of Israel, from Abraham to Saint Paul, ris- 
ing above the narrow sects of Scribes and Phari- 
sees dwelling within the lifeless body of the law, 
broke the bondage of the letter while saving and 
renovating the spirit ; and urging upon her Chris- 
tian readers the duty of self-consistency, of ap- 
proaching the Jewish Question from a Christian 
standpoint, and importing into their opinions and 
practice some tincture of the sublime doctrine of the 
Sermon on the Mount. Dwelling thus upon those 
broader and deeper phases of her subject which 
tend to stir the more generous emotions and quicken 
the sense of abstract right and justice, Miss Laza- 
rus touches but lightly and incidently on its more 
specific, acute, and, one may say, prosaic aspects. 



To the practical mind there seems to be little need 
of seeking for occult and profound causes for the 
plain fact that the Jew, wherever he goes or stays, 
becomes and remains in some degree an object of 
antipathy to his neighbors. His racial isolation is 
primarily bound up with his own fatal tenet that 
he is one of a Chosen People, a being apart and 
peculiarly sanctified in the eyes of the Maker of 
all, and hence religiously bound to abstain from 
mingling too intimately with the unclean tide of 
Gentile humanity. So long as he clings to this es- 
timate of himself as compared with other nations, 
it is not strange that his appeals to the world's tol- 
erance and enlightenment should have a ring of 
unreason in Gentile ears. That everybody ought 
to harbor and tolerate the Jew, while the Jew ought 
to harbor and tolerate nobody, is a proposition not 
likely to find either logical or practical acceptance. 
A most discouraging feature of the Jewish Ques- 
tion is the fact that centuries of discord between 
Jew and Gentile have bred a mutual instinctive dis- 
like, not founded in reason and not to be reasoned 
away ; of secular growth, and not to be effaced by 
the effort and generous impulse of a generation. 
While we believe that the initiative toward a better 
and more rational state of things lies with the Jew 
himself, it seems clear enough that no final solution 
of the Jewish Question can be looked for without 
a large decrease in the world's general stock of 
ignorance and fanaticism. We commend Miss Laz- 
arus's book as an earnest and liberal discussion of 
the higher moral issues of a subject which she be- 
lieves to be " confronted with every great question 
of the day social, political, financial, humanita- 
rian, national, and religious." 

What Grimm is to Germany, and 

p. erha P 8 mor . e ' Afanasiev . is to Rus - 

sia. From his vast collection of folk- 
lore, Ralston drew his "Russian Folk Tales." 
From the same great storehouse, Polevoi drew his 
collection of Mdhrchen, published at St. Petersburg 
in 1874. Two dozen of Polevoi's stories, happily 
done into English by Mr. R. Nisbet Bain, appear 
in a volume of " Russian Fairy Tales " (Way & 
Williams). There is a directness, a simplicity, a 
quaintness about these tales that is quite delicious. 
The themes are few and common to European folk- 
tales generally, but they have a local and ethnic 
flavor, as told by the Russian, that is attractive. The 
favorite plot presents the searcher, who for love of 
a beautiful lady journeys the wide world through 
to accomplish the supposedly impossible ; kindness 
to all sorts of apparently worthless vagabonds and 
beasts gains its reward in needed help at the crisis ; 
of course success always crowns the effort. Not 
only is the same theme found in tale after tale, but 
the same quaint expressions and combinations of 
words. Thus, of the hero, when commanded to 
perform some difficult feat, it is repeatedly affirmed 
that "his impetuous head hung lower than his 
shoulders." To him, in this sad plight, his dear

love usually says, " Lie down and rest, the morn- 
ing is better than the evening." At many places 
in these stories there are pretty hints of ancient 
life, custom, or belief, as where at a critical mo- 
ment the hero turns " to all four points of the com- 
pass." Quite surely there is here a hit of ancient 
religion. One very quaint common conception is 
the rotating hut. The hero is being directed by a 
magic ball : " it rolled a long way, and at last it 
came to a miserable hut; the hut was standing on 
hen's legs and turning round and round." Ad- 
dressed, it halts, and the visitor entering encounters 
a hag. In the story " Verlioka" we have one of 
the most original and curious of the many European 
variants of the " Bremen Town Musicians." We 
have said enough to show that in this collection a 
child will find amusement, and the more serious 
student a delightful rendering of some good speci- 
mens of the peculiar Russian type of familiar 
Mdhrchen. 

A practical ^ r - Horace Fletcher's little book en- 

Mark Tapieyian titled " Menticulture " ( McClurg ) 
philosopher. is os tensibly " a Kindergarten pre- 

sentation of a theory of menticulture through the 
elimination of the germs of the evil passions." We 
may describe it generally as a bacteriological doc- 
trine of morals, the main thesis being that mental 
disease, like physical, may be done away with by 
the process of discovering and killing the germs. 
Do not parley with the enemy or temporize with 
him, but lay the axe at once to the root, is Mr. 
Fletcher's governing maxim. " Anger and Worry," 
he holds, are the twin radical germs of all our men- 
tal ailments and disquietudes ; whence it follows 
that if you once eradicate these germs you become, 
ipso facto, once and for all, a sound and happy man. 
Divested of metaphor, all this seems to amount to 
the easy proposition that if you do n't get angiy and 
worry, you will save yourself a great amount of 
worry and anger attendant evils of course in- 
cluded. The proposal is sound enough logically ; 
but, as a practical measure, it look very like humor- 
ously telling a man to lift himself out of the mire 
by his boot-straps, or to jump away from his own 
shadow. Mr. Fletcher, however, has, contrary to 
the usage of the healing faculty, tried his own rem- 
edy, and with the happiest results. Since it first 
occurred to him to degerminate himself, he has 
been, as we gather from his narrative, uniformly 
the very pink of amiability and soul of the kindlier 
virtues absolutely bomb-proof, so to speak, against 
the provocations of the " Pullman porter, conduc- 
tor, hotel waiter, peddler, book-agent, cabman," and 
other bacteria infesting the social body. He is, in 
fact, a veritable Mark Tapley, who, having acquired 
the art of " coming out strong " under even the 
most trying circumstances, is anxious to impart the 
secret to a perverse and ill-tempered world. There 
certainly can be little harm in the precepts of two 
such cheerful philosophers as Mark Tapley and 
Mr. Fletcher.

Scribner's Sons, and sold only by subscription, pro- 
vides collectors with a uniform set of the greater 
portion of Stevenson's writings, very attractive in 
execution and moderate in cost. Eleven volumes 
are devoted to the novels, four to the essays and 
books of travel, while one is found sufficient for the 
contents of Stevenson's three collections of verse. 
Each volume has a photogravure or etched frontis- 
piece, by such artists as Mr. Low, Mr. Blashfield, 
and Mr. Walter Crane. There are also two por- 
traits of the author. A number of things not here- 
tofore printed in the regular editions appear in this 
one, among which we may mention " The Misad- 
ventures of John Nicholson," " The Story of a Lie," 
" Father Damien," " The Body Snatcher," and a 
number of essays. " Treasure Island," which is 
volume two of the new edition, is accompanied by 
the author's account of how the book came to be 
written. The volumes are from new plates made 
at the De Vinne press, and are neatly bound. 

We gave brief mention, in a recent 
issue, to the opening volumes of the 
series of annotated " English Class- 
ics " planned by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
A new volume in that series, Scott's " Woodstock," 
edited by Professor Bliss Perry, deepens the im- 
pression made by the earlier number that this series 
is one of unusual excellence in the editing, and will 
prove a valuable auxiliary in the reform of English 
teaching now generally in progress. The following 
extract from the publishers' announcement indicates 
the method of treatment aimed at in these books, 
and we would add that the volumes now published 
amply bear out the claim advanced. " The works 
prescribed for reading are treated, in every case, 
as literature, not as texts for narrow linguistic study, 
and edited with a view to interesting the student 
in the book in question, both in itself and as repre- 
sentative of a literary type or of a period of litera- 
ture, and of leading him on to read other standard 
works of the same age or kind understandingly and 
appreciatively." In the " Woodstock," for exam- 
ple, we have, in addition to the unabridged text of 
the novel, a careful editorial introduction ; the au- 
thor's introduction, preface, and notes ; a reprint 
of " The Just Devil of Woodstock "; and such foot- 
notes as the student will need as he turns from page 
to page. Besides all this apparatus, many of the 
chapters have appended a few suggestive hints for 
character-study, collateral reading, and discussions 
of the art of fiction. All this matter is so skilfully 
distributed that it does not weigh upon the con- 
science, and is not likely to make the student for- 
get that he is, after all, reading a novel chiefly for 
the pleasure it affords. The entire aim of this vol- 
ume and its companions is literary, rather than his- 
torical or linguistic, and in this fact their chief 
value is to be found.

A manual of ^ one wno * 8 acquainted with Pro- 
educationai thoughts fessor Daniel Putnam, the veteran 
and methods. instructor in psychology and peda- 

gogy in the Michigan State Normal School, would 
expect him to introduce startling novelties, or what 
is called " advanced thinking," into a pedagogical 
treatise. One would, rather, expect him to produce 
a body of wisely selected educational thoughts and 
methods, which had been tried in the fires of theo- 
retical criticism and practical experience, the whole 
well thought out, carefully arranged, well illustrated, 
and offered to the reader in well-chosen language. 
And this is just what he has done in his book en- 
titled "A Manual of Pedagogy" (Silver, Burdett, 
& Co.). For the common teacher seeking intelli- 
gent guidance in his work by private reading, for 
the reading circle, for the teacher's class in the high 
school or the normal class in pedagogics, we do not 
now recall a book that is better worthy of being 
recommended. Two chapters of forty-five pages 
are devoted to the study of children, which is quite 
disproportionate. It is assumed (page 83) that 
there is a " moral perception " which " examines 
and decides questions " of right and wrong, which 
is not " moral judgment." No doubt Professor 
Putnam will admit that the only difference between 
what he calls " moral perception " and " moral 
judgment" is the greater or less degree of com- 
plexity of the process. Whenever perception passes 
upon a moral question, saying, " This is right " or 
" That is wrong," it utters a judgment. We are 
glad to see that the author bestows reasonable at- 
tention upon the active principles of human nature, 
the feelings and the will ; not falling into the too 
common mistake of supposing that education is an 
affair of the intellect merely. It is a defect of the 
book that there are no references to the numerous 
quotations. 

The six articles that make up Pro- 
fessor Albert Bushnell Hart's new 
volume, " Studies in American Edu- 
cation " (Longmans, Green, & Co.), appeared in the 
years 18871893 in well-known magazines and re- 
views. As qualification for writing them, the author 
adds to general scholarship and successful exper- 
ience in teaching, a special interest in the subject 
of education, and particularly American education. 
Moreover, he has won a good degree by services in 
the Cambridge School Committee, where, it is un- 
derstood, he has been influential in causing the new 
four years' course of study to be introduced into the 
grammar schools of that city. His studies have a 
decidedly practical tendency, and together consti- 
tute an addition to our steadily growing stock of 
good educational literature. There may be differ- 
ences of opinion as to which of the studies is the 
most valuable, but students of American education 
are likely to find the first one, entitled " Has the 
Teacher a Profession ? " the most readable. Pro- 
fessor Hart's remarks on the prevailing popular dis- 
trust of experts, and the low estimate in which real

learning is held, are both interesting and humiliat- 
ing. That a foreign domestic established in an 
American professor's kitchen should ask her mis- 
tress whether the head of the house " had any real 
profession," is not surprising ; but to find the wife 
of a member of the academical staff at Cambridge 
observing that " she could never see what President 
Eliot could find to do," is, to put it mildly, depres- 
sing. 

Book titles are often misleading, but 
such is not the case with Professor 
Thomas's " Practical German Gram- 
mar" (Holt), for the book is thoroughly practical. 
One of its especial features is the treatment of pro- 
nunciation. Some elementary phonetic principles 
are very simply illustrated and used as a basis in 
describing the various sounds. The student learns 
to produce the sounds, not to imitate what he un- 
derstands the teacher to say. The connected exer- 
cises beginning with the fourth lesson are a distinct 
advance over anything that has yet appeared in that 
line. An American boy describes in letters his 
experiences in Germany. Incidentally they serve 
to arouse interest in German life and customs, and 
are accompanied by notes that explain unfamiliar 
matters, idioms, etc. The chapters on Syntax pre- 
sent the facts clearly, and illustrate with aptly- 
chosen examples that are in every instance carefully 
translated. In the arrangement and treatment of 
this part of the book, the influence of Brandt's 
Grammar is very evident, but the statements are 
fuller and clearer. The appendix contains some 
remarks on orthography, and an excellent treat- 
ment of cognates. The colloquies and exercises fur- 
nish sufficient practice, so that no reader is needed ; 
and after finishing Part I. the student is prepared 
to read any one of the numerous short stories that 
have been annotated and edited for school use. The 
book is a distinct advance upon anything at present 
in the market, and will doubtless prove not only a 
valuable and useful text-book but will contribute 
toward a better preparation on the part of students 
who present German as an entrance subject in col- 
lege. 

" The Principles of Rhetoric " (Har- 
P er )' b y Professor A. S. Hill, is an 
example of the best sort of text-book. 
Based, in its earlier editions, upon wide scholarship 
and sound principles, it now adds to these substan- 
tial foundations a superstructure of illustration and 
suggestion derived from the reading of many years, 
and from the experience that results from inter- 
course with many classes of college students. In 
its present revised and enlarged form, it is easily 
the best manual for instruction in rhetoric now ob- 
tainable by American teachers. Its method is pre- 
eminently that of teaching by example ; its formu- 
lations of doctrine, clear and concise, in every case 
lead up to an ample series of illustrative extracts, 
ranging all the way from Shakespeare to the Amer- 
ican newspaper the latter introduced mainly for

reproof. So aptly-chosen are these extracts, and so 
interesting in themselves, that the study of rhetoric, 
pursued with their aid, is in no danger of suffering 
from the reproach of arid technicality, and ought 
to become a delight to the right-minded student. 
We may mention in this connection, as in a way 
supplementary to Professor Hill's book, the admir- 
able series of "Specimens" (Holt), of which we 
have previously mentioned the volumes devoted to 
" Argumentation " and " Exposition," and which is 
now completed by the publication of Dr. C. S. Bald- 
win's " Specimens of Prose Description," and Mr. 
W. T. Brewster's " Specimens of Narration." These 
little books are carefully edited, and teachers will 
find them exceedingly helpful. 



It required no little planning to con- 
^,. dense "The Complete Poetic and 

Dramatic Works of Robert Brown- 
ing" within the limits of a single volume, but 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have accomplished 
the difficult task, and made a book that is at once 
attractive and readable. They have even done 
more than was promised, for they have added the 
essay on Shelley, heretofore practically inaccessible 
to the general reader, and highly valuable both in- 
trinsically and as the most important example of 
Browning's prose. This " Cambridge Edition " of 
Browning extends to 1033 double-columned pages, 
has a fine portrait and an engraved vignette view 
of Asolo, a biographical introduction by Mr. Horace 
E. Scudder, indexes of titles and first lines, and all 
the notes that an intelligent reader ought to ask for. 
The book, with its " infinite riches in a [compara- 
tively] little room," is really a marvel of careful 
editing and mechanical design, and deserves high 
praise from every standpoint. Is it too much to 
hope that we may sometime have a similar edition 
of the poetical works of Mr. Swinburne ? 



Ideals of 

modern 

education. 



Mr. James P. Monroe, formerly of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, in " The Educational Ideal, 
an Outline of Its Growth in Modern Times" 
(Heath), has done a decidedly creditable piece of 
pedagogical work. He assumes that since the days 
of the schoolmen the most advanced nations have 
been steadily working out a common conception or 
ideal of child-training ; and this he at once proves 
and explains by passing in review the principal con- 
tributors and contributions to the work. It cannot 
be claimed that these characterizations of the edu- 
cational reformers fully describe in all cases the 
work they have done ; nor are we sure that the 
particular phase of the reformer's influence hit 
upon is in every case the characteristic one, as, 
for example, in the case of Comenius. Still, Mr. 
Monroe has gone carefully over his field ; he has 
brought together the most valuable educational ideas 
of the men whom he passes in review ; and, if his 
interpretations may sometimes be objected to, the 



value of his contribution to the history of modern 
education will not be questioned by those who are 
capable of passing upon the matter.

to Herbartian ers and pedagogists are not to be left 
pedagogy. j n doubt ag to the Herbartian doc- 

trines; or, if they are, it will be their own fault. 
The latest addition to the literature of the subject 
is Chr. Ufer's " Introduction to the Pedagogy of 
Herbart," translated by Mr. J. C. Zinser, edited by 
President De Garmo of Swarthmore College, and 
published by Messrs. Heath & Co. The book is an 
authoritative exposition of its subject. The learned 
editor says that while it does not make all hard 
things easy, it has certainly rendered it possible for 
the thoughtful reader to make a profitable begin- 
ning of the Herbartian pedagogy, of course. " It 
has been the bridge," he says, " over which thou- 
sands of teachers have passed to independent study 
and research." The book is recommended by its 
moderate size only a hundred and twenty pages. 

Mr. Thomas J. Morgan's " Patriotic 
Patriotism Citizenship" (American Book Co.) 

and citizenship. . , 77 * r i r i i 

is a humble but useful piece of book- 
making. Its object is wholly practical : " To stim- 
ulate patriotism and to promote good citizenship." 
Its plan can be stated in few words. " Patriotism " 
is the first of the seventeen topics that are treated. 
The author asks, " What is Patriotism ? " and he 
answers in a sentence his own question. Then fol- 
low brief quotations from Goldsmith, Shakespeare, 
Noah Webster, Burke, and others. The questions, 
" Why should we love our native land ? " " Is 
Patriotism merely a personal or local attachment 
to one's home?" and many more, are treated in 
the same manner. The other general topics, as 
"The Flag," "The Revolution," "The War for 
the Union," follow in order. The author shows a 
good knowledge of the literature of his subjects, 
and good judgment in making his selections.

teaching feels that he must prove his 
quality by promptly coming before the public as an 
editor of some text. Fortunately, there are several 
enterprising publishing firms ready to accept this 
sort of literary product as fast as it is offered, and 
the modern teacher of French or German is happy 
in finding to his hand so wide a choice of texts as 
to prove almost embarrassing. Only those who 
have been at the work for twenty years can fully 
appreciate the difference between present and ear- 
lier conditions in this respect. Mr. John R. Effinger, 
Jr., seeking to pay his maiden tribute to pedagogy, 
has had the happy inspiration to select for an- 
notation a group of " Selected Essays from Sainte- 
Beuve " (Ginn), than which he could have made no 
better choice. The booklet appears in the " Inter- 
national Modern Language " series.

Metaphor and 



" Metaphor and Simile in the Minor 
Elizabethan Drama" is the subject 
Elizabethan drama. o f tne doctoral dissertation offered 
last summer by Mr. Frederic Ives Carpenter to the 
University of Chicago, and now published by the 
University Press. It is a monograph displaying 
great industry and fine critical tact, giving to its 
subject a fuller treatment than it has, to our knowl- 
edge, ever before received. The dramatists ex- 
amined in detail are Lyly, Peele, Marlowe, Kyd, 
Greene, Tourneur, Webster, Chapman, and Jonson. 
These special studies are followed by a tabular 
presentation of the results, and a highly valuable 
synthetic discussion of the subject of the thesis. 
This monograph is distinguished not only by schol- 
arship, but by a well-balanced and finished literary 
style. The latter quality is none too common, even 
in dissertations upon literary themes, and must be 
particularly singled out for commendation. 

The spiritual Messrs. Copeland & Day have issued, 
autobiography of in a limited edition upon hand-made 
Waiter Pater. pa per, "The Child in the House," 
that hitherto almost inaccessible chapter of spiritual 
autobiography written many years ago by Walter 
Pater. The booklet makes but forty-three small 
pages, but every one of them is a joy. The test of 
such a study as this aside from the purely liter- 
ary tests is, of course, the fidelity with which it 
seizes the moods and fancies that all children have 
at some time dimly experienced, and gives to them 
truthful and permanent expression. This test is 
triumphantly met, while the beauty of the style is 
such as to set the study above the reach of praise. 
It is a miniature classic, if there ever was one. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" King Lear," with a pretty photo-etching of Dover 
Cliff, is the latest addition to the ever-charming " Tem- 
ple " Shakespeare, published by Messrs. Macmillan. 

Mr. Richard Burton's new volume of verse, " Dumb 
in June, and Other Poems," is expected this month 
from the press of Messrs. Copeland & Day. 

" Popular Tales," by Maria Edgeworth, with illustra- 
tions by Miss Hammond, and an introduction by Mrs. 
Ritchie, is the latest volume in the Macmillan series of 
fiction reprints. 

An entirely new edition of Byron's works complete 
the first since 1833 is among the more interesting 
announcements of Messrs. Macmillan & Co. It will 
be in ten volumes. 

An old poetical acquaintance, Coventry Patmore, is 
to be brought to the notice of latter-day readers in a 
collection of " Poems of Pathos and Delight," soon to 
be issued by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

A volume of the letters written by Victor Hugo to 
his wife, chiefly during his travels, and included in no 
English or American edition of Hugo, will be issued 
immediately by Messrs. Estes & Lauriat. The trans- 
lation is by Mr. Dole. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker was in Chicago on the fifteenth 



of this month as the guest of the Twentieth Century 
Club. He spoke of " The Patrol of the Far North," in 
other words, of the romantic and adventurous phases of 
the work done by the Hudson Bay Company. 

" Westward Ho ! " and " Two Years Ago " in two 
volumes each, and " Alton Locke " in one, have been 
added to Messrs. Macmillan & Co.'s " Pocket Edi- 
tion " of the novels of Charles Kingsley, and continue 
that very neat and serviceable publication. We could 
have wished, indeed, for a size of type one degree larger, 
but there are now so many editions of these novels that 
nearly all possible tastes must be gratified by one or 
the other of them. 

A new vest-pocket edition of the " Imitation " pub- 
lished at the Oxford University Press (Nelson & Sons) is 
a marvel of book-making. It is two inches square, one- 
third of an inch thick (morocco binding included) and 
contains 576 pages. The weight is something like half 
an ounce. This wonder is made possible by the India 
paper on which the booklet is printed, paper so thin 
that it might be a fabric woven of the spider's web, yet 
so strong that it is not easy to tear, and so opaque that 
the print is not seen through the page. 

" Vernon Lee's " new volume of essays is to be enti- 
tled " Renaissance Fancies and Studies " and is to pro- 
vide a sequel to " Euphorion." It will contain the fol- 
lowing essays: "The Love of the Saints" (a study of 
the influence of the Franciscan movement on art), " The 
Imaginative Art of the Renaissance," " Tuscan Sculp- 
ture," a valedictory chapter on the value of similar 
studies (comprising an estimate of the late Walter 
Pater), and a biographical romance of the 15th century, 
called " A Seeker of Pagan Perfection." 

If a man has to be " jumped upon," it is well that 
the job should be done with neatness and dispatch. 
This sometimes necessary work (however painful to its 
subject) is performed for President G. Stanley Hall in 
the November 8 issue of " Science," so thoroughly that 
even the disjecta membra are hardly to be found lying 
about. The victim of the process, in his capacity as 
editor of " The American Journal of Psychology," re- 
cently published the astonishing statement that " under 
the influence " of certain of his pupils " departments of 
experimental psychology and laboratories were founded 
at Harvard, Yale, Philadelphia, Columbia, Toronto, 
Wisconsin, and many other higher institutions of learn- 
ing." This statement calls forth letters from Profes- 
sor James of Harvard, Professor Ladd of Yale, Profes- 
sor Baldwin, formerly of Toronto, and Professor Cat- 
tell, formerly of Philadelphia, and now of Columbia. 
Each of these gentlemen is very distinctly under the 
impression that he himself founded the department of 
experimental psychology in the university with which 
he is, or was, connected, and that neither President 
Hall nor his pupils had anything to do with the organ- 
ization of the work. Like Coriolanus, they cry : " Alone 
I did it. Boy!" Even Wisconsin is not left standing 
to the credit of the Great American Claimant, for Pro- 
fessor Jastrow began the work there, and Professor 
Jastrow was a member of Johns Hopkins University 
before Dr. Hall. It seems that in the cases of Har- 
vard and Yale, certain of Dr. Hall's pupils have 
acted temporarily as assistants in the psychological 
work, and upon two or three facts of this sort Presi- 
dent Hall has built up his curious ex post facto theory 
of the greatness of his influence. We would suggest 
that the phenomena of megalomania might profitably 
be investigated in the laboratory of Clark University.

GRAND WINTER CRUISES 

BY THE MAGNIFICENT 

TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS 

OF THE 

if[ HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE. 

FOR several years past the Hamburg-American Line lias arranged excursions at certain 
seasons, placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces, and affording 
them all the comforts and luxuries of modern life. These cruises have become so popular 
with the American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of 
its service. _ 

THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin -Screw Express Steamer FURST BISMARCK, 
Captain Albers, sailing from New York January 28, 1896, to MADEIRA, the MED- 
ITERRANEAN, and the ORIENT. 

Touching at Madeira, Gibraltar, Algiers, Genoa, Villefranche (Nice), Tunis, Alexandria (Cairo 
and Pyramids), Jaffa (Jerusalem), Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Malta, Messina, Palermo, Naples, 
Genoa, and return to New York. 

The cruise from New York to the Orient and return to New York will occupy about ten weeks. Pas- 
sengers desiring to prolong their stay in Europe before returning to America may leave the excursion 
upon touching at Genoa the second time and take any one of the Hamburg-American Line's Express 
Steamers from Hamburg, Southampton, or Cherbourg, to New York, up to August 1, 1896. 

Ever since the childhood of the human race the Mediterranean coasts have played the most important 
part in the history of advancing civilization. Greece has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and 
poetry, Rome has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft, Egypt has filled our 
souls with thrills of awe and wonderment, the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig- 
ious fervor. All along the blue Mediterranean Sea we find the indelible imprints of man's past, the glo- 
rious monuments of antiquity. The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes, not in artistic 
reproduction, but in all its realistic grandeur and glory. The memories of such a trip, the sights of the 
scenery of the most remarkable events of man's history, will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every 
beholder. _ 

THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin -Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA, Cap- 
tain Vogelgesang, sailing from New York January 25, 1896, to the WEST INDIES 
and the SPANISH MAIN. 

The Itinerary will include the following ports : Port au Prince (Hayti), Mayaguez (Porto Rico), 
St. Thomas, St. Kitts, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, Trinidad, La Guayra 
(for Caracas) and Puerto Cabello ( Venezuela), Kingston (Jamaica), Havana, New York. 

This tour lasts about four and a half weeks, and offers American tourists a most attractive and com- 
fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters. 

A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure, recalling many a famous 
exploit of dead-and-gone worthies. But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely 
palm-covered beaches, of beautiful scenery and strange peoples, offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible 
fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses. In cruising from port to port in these en- 
chanted seas, among verdant and flower-clothed islands, nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful 
mood, and life in the tropics at its best. It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine any attribute of an 
ideal winter resort not found among these " Fortunate Isles." 



TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST.

$30.00. Net. 

(^NE hundred and thirty-one full -page photogravure reproductions of 
S^ Mr. ABBEY'S drawings illustrate this edition of THE COMEDIES OF 
SHAKESPEARE. The text is that of the folio of 1623, with obvious errors 
corrected and the orthography modernized, and the retention of passages 
which occur in the folio, but which many editors have omitted, will be 
noted with interest. These volumes should be welcomed equally by the 
student and reader of Shakespeare, and the lover of artistic illustration. 
As the basis of the process of photogravure by which these copper- 
plate pictures are made is photographic, all forms in the original draw- 
ings are perfectly retained, and the qualities faithfully rendered, so far 
as the translatable portions of these superb drawings can be reproduced. 
Museums were ransacked for the costumes and armor of the periods, and 
almost forgotten bits were brought to light by the diligent search of the 
enthusiastic artist. Old hangings and cabinets, that may have been a part 
of the surroundings of the dramatis personce, have been skilfully used as 
decorative backgrounds, and form no small part of these charming com- 
positions. These drawings are the result of many years of careful thought. 
Months were spent in the study of the scenery and accessories of each 
play, and the student and the antiquary will find much in these illustra- 
tions to delight his eye. No other illustrator has got so near to the heart 
of the immortal bard. The text and illustrations of these unique volumes 
will average about 3^0 pages each.

SELECTIONS FROM THE LIST OF HOLIDAY 
PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY MESSRS. 
COPELAND AND DAY. SEASON OF 1895. 

ARABELLA AND ARAMINTA STORIES. BY GERTRUDE SMITH.

PAGE PICTURES BY ETHEL REED : Large square octavo, with ornamental cover and end papers, 
$2.00. Fifteen copies, ten of which are for sale, printed on Royal Japanese paper especially imported 
from Tokio, containing four sets of the plates in colors, on Oriental papers, and extra decorations, by

manufactured for this book. Octavo, $1.25. Thirty-five copies on China paper, bound in Chinan binding, $3.00.

MOODY'S LODGING HOUSE, and Other Tenement Sketches. By ALVAN F. SANBORN. Octavo, 
$1.25. 

MEADOW GRASS. A Book of New England Stories. By ALICE BROWN. Third Thousand. Octavo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

" There is a motion, a light, joyous tread, which gives ' Meadow Grass ' a subtle attraction, not to be found, we venture to say, in any other 
collection of New England tales. . . . It has remained for Miss Brown to enter the same general field with Mrs. Stowe, Miss Jewett, Mrs. Slosson, 
Miss Wilkins, and Mr. Robinson and without producing a new variety of tale, or scarcely any new character, to use familiar material, and yet 
illumine it with a new light. We cannot define it more closely than by saying that the genuine humor which pervades the best of her work ia 
closely identified with the love of sunshine, of growing things, and the changes of light and shade in the human soul. . . . The entire effect of the 
book is of a natural beauty, springing spontaneously and findingimost apt expression. . . . There is a true wildwood flavor, a rusticity, which is 
not a mere foil to civility.'' Atlantic Monthly. 

JACQUES DAMOUR, and Other Stories. By EMILE ZOLA. Englished by WILLIAM FOSTER APTHORP. 

Octavo, cloth, $1.25. Twenty copies on China paper, $3.00. 

"Mr. Apthorp has translated them superbly with a frank and intimate sympathy that is almost genius." New York Commercial Advertiser. 

" ' Jacques Damour ' is one of the strongest of Zola's tales, and it is not unlikely that by his short stories he will be best remembered. . . . 
If the English volume shows the savage strength of the industrious Frenchman, it also reveals in that most laughable ' Cocqueville Spree ' the 
humor of the man. . . . The English reader who hitherto has unfortunately only known Zola by the unfavorable reports of those who either can- 
not or will not understand him, as he shakes over Mr. Apthorp's sympathetic Englishing, will rub his eyes and say : ' Why, this Zola is, after all, 
intensely human.' " Boston Journal. 

" Instantly, if there be a bit of critical sense in any reader, the art, the tremendous compelling power of Zola, seizes the mind, and compels 
the flippant provincial estimate of French work as merely Gallic to cease its effort for preeminence." Boston Transcript. 

"With a single stroke of his pen M. Zola gives life and fullness to his characters, of whom all are natural and true to their environment. 
The triumph of his art in this respect is not an open question." Tribune (New York). 

THE CHILD IN THE HOUSE. An Imaginary Portrait. By WALTER PATER. Edition limited to 350 
copies on hand-made paper. Small octavo, limp, blue paper cover, $1.50.

WA GNER IN CHICAGO. 

The two weeks' season of German opera, 
under the effective leadership of Mr. Walter 
Damrosch, just ended in Chicago, has been 
peculiarly satisfying to lovers of music, both 
on account of the even excellence of the whole 
series of performances, and because of the evi- 
dence it has supplied of a genuine public taste 
for the greatest masterpieces of the lyric stage. 
The performances have mainly been devoted 
to the works of Richard Wagner, the only 
non-Wagnerian productions having been the 
" Freischiitz " of Weber, and the " Fidelio " 
of Beethoven two operas so closely akin to 
" Tristan " and " Die Walkiire " that the as- 
sociation was both fit and salutary. The au- 
diences have been large and appreciative, dis- 
playing a subdued but stern enthusiasm as far 
as possible removed from the noisy ebullition 
of feeling usually evoked by works of the bar- 
rel-organ type. The best evidence that the 
performances have been taken as seriously as 
they deserve is to be found in the fact that 
large numbers of people have sought to prepare 
themselves for the works by some preliminary 
study of their structure. Not only have the 
expository morning lectures of Mr. Damrosch 
attracted crowds of listeners, but a number of 
local musicians as well have addressed large 
audiences of students eager to equip themselves

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



with the knowledge necessary for a comprehen- 
sion of the interwoven harmonies of the " Nib- 
el ungen " tetralogy. 

Of course the Philistine, after the manner 
of his kind, jeers at this sort of thing, as he 
would jeer at anyone who should attend a course 
of lectures on Shakespeare in anticipation of a 
season of Mr. Irving, or as he has recently been 
jeering, in his favorite role of newspaper critic 
of music, at the extremely helpful analytical 
programmes this year for the first time pro- 
vided for the concerts of the Chicago Orchestra. 
In his view, works of dramatic and musical art 
are for the amusement of mankind, not for their 
instruction or ethical discipline, and, in the 
depths of his vulgar ignorance, he resents as a 
personal affront the suggestion that they may 
have for others any deeper meaning than they 
have for him. As a monumental illustration 
of the incapacity of such critics, we may in- 
stance the argument, which we have come 
across more than once in the public print, that 
"Die Walkiire" is to be condemned upon 
moral grounds because it depicts the love of 
Siegmund and Sieglinde. One might say to 
such a critic, " I thank thee, Jew, for teaching 
me that word," for at least it consigns Wagner 
and ^Eschylus to a common infamy, and the 
most fervent apostle of the German composer 
would hardly venture, unprompted, to pedestal 
him beside the Greek tragic poet. The inep- 
titude which makes possible such an amazing 
verdict as we have above recorded does not, of 
course, deserve serious notice, but it does excite 
some curiosity to feel the bumps of the man 
who was capable of expressing such an opinion. 

The history of Wagnerian music in Chicago 
covers a score of years. It is difficult now to 
think of the " Tannhauser " overture and the 
" Lohengrin " nuptial chorus as novelties, but 
a quarter of a century ago it required confi- 
dence and even daring to include them in a 
popular concert programme. Mr. Thomas, 
fortunately, was equal to the occasion, and his 
Wagnerian propaganda was begun in Chicago 
with two or three numbers of this sort as long 
ago as before the Great Fire, of which we read 
in our ancient history. It was a little over 
twenty years ago that the first performance of 
a Wagner opera was heard in Chicago. The 
work was " Lohengrin," and Madame Albani 
sang the part of the heroine. Two or three 
years later came the " Dutchman," with Miss 
Kellogg in the character of Senta. " Tann- 
hauser " came next, then " Kienzi." About a 
dozen years ago Chicago got " Die Walkiire " 



as a first instalment of the Nibelungen tetral- 
ogy. At about this time the late Dr. Damrosch 
gave us the first performance of the " Parsi- 
fal " Vorspiel. Not long after, the entire series 
of the " Ring der Nibelungen " was given, and 
this work was soon followed by the " Meister- 
singer van Niirnberg." " Tristan and Isolde " 
had its first production in Chicago in the spring 
of the present year, and completed the list of 
the Wagnerian music-dramas, with the single 
exception of " Parsifal," which, we need hardly 
say, has not yet been given (as a stage per- 
formance) anywhere in America. And during 
all these years, Mr. Thomas has so persistently 
included Wagnerian selections in his orchestral 
programmes that many of them have become 
as familiar as were the " William Tell " and 
" Freischiitz " overtures m the old pre- Wag- 
nerian days. 

The importance of the educational work done 
in this direction by our veteran conductor can 
hardly be over-estimated. He has done more 
than anyone else to make the music of the fu- 
ture the music of the present, to confound the 
rage of the heathen, and to confute the vain 
imaginings of old-fogyism. We understand 
that it has always been rather against the per- 
sonal inclinations of Mr. Thomas that he has 
given so disproportionate an amount of atten- 
tion to the works of a single modern composer, 
that he would much have preferred to play 
Beethoven and Mozart, but that he at first rec- 
ognized the necessity of combating the strength 
of ignorant anti- Wagnerian prejudice, and af- 
terwards found that so irresistible a popular 
demand for Wagner had been created in the 
music-loving public of this city that he could not 
do otherwise than satisfy it, seeing that the de- 
mand had been so largely of his own creating. A 
word should also be said of the work done dur- 
ing these years by the most influential and schol- 
arly musical critic in Chicago. Mr. Upton's 
long and honorable connection with journalism 
in this city has been noteworthy in many ways, 
but in none more so than in the zeal and sym- 
pathy which it has brought to all the attempts 
made by Mr. Thomas and others to make of 
the music of Eichard Wagner an integral and 
intimate part of the musical consciousness of 
Chicago audiences. 

Those of us who have been watching for years 
sometimes hopefully, sometimes despond- 
ently, and always eagerly for signs of the de- 
velopment of this great city upon its spiritual 
side have derived more satisfaction from the 
progress of musical culture than from any other

single source. While painting and sculpture 
and architecture have at times seemed to be 
making no headway at all, while educational 
and literary ideals have lagged far behind the 
march of material prosperity, while true civic 
feeling has seemed to be forgotten in the 
all-absorbing passion for money - getting, the 
growth of culture in music, the most ideal of 
the arts, has been gratifying in the extreme. 
At the present day, music is probably the larg- 
est factor in the spiritual life of this commun- 
ity, and few communities anywhere offer such 
opportunities for musical culture. The most 
important serious musical review published in 
America is produced in Chicago ; one of the 
three or four best orchestras in the world may 
be heard here in weekly concerts ; the two 
great operatic organizations that occupy the 
field this year give Chicago a large share of 
their attention ; we are having more good cham- 
ber music than ever before ; the great soloists 
of the concert-stage all find here a cordial wel- 
come, while one of them, at least, makes this 
city her home ; and when we look beyond these 
conspicuous features of our musical life, into 
the work of the societies, and the schools, and 
the private teachers with their individual fol- 
lowing, we find an activity that is more than 
hopeful, a state of things that comes near to 
realizing the best that it is reasonable to ex- 
pect of any American community, a f ermentive 
influence at work that is leavening for good 
the whole heterogenous human mass. 



IN GRATITUDE TO PROFESSOR BOYESEN. 



The late Professor Boyesen, like most persons of in- 
terest, was a bundle of contradictions; and to estimate 
his influence, or even trace his manner of thought, one 
must begin and end with the cherished notion that in- 
consistency, not consistency, is the proverbial jewel, if 
indeed the latter is not a bugbear of weak minds. An 
illustration of his delightfully human obliquity, and at 
the same time perhaps of his childlike naivete, is afforded 
by the circumstances of the following letter, confided to 
me by a young man who was at the crossways of jour- 
nalism and teaching when recently he sought the genial 
professor's advice. It is a dilemma so frequently con- 
fronting college-bred men of literary tastes, and Pro- 
fessor Boyesen's words are so pertinent and character- 
istic, that I venture, with " Nicodemus's " permission, to 
reproduce them. 

NEW YORK, May 29, 1894. 
MY DEAR MR. : 

. . . Will you pardon me if I say that I think you are very 
sanguine, and take rather unwarrantable risks, in giving up a 
safe and sure position as a teacher for the very uncertain 
chance of making a success in journalism, at a time when there 
are a hundred applicants (so often very able ones) for every 
position. I have seen so much misery this winter among 



young educated men, who had done the very thing that you 
propose to do, that I cannot refrain from warning you. 

In 1880 I gave up my Cornell professorship for the very 
same reason that you adduce ; and I was very glad to resume 
the professorial harness at Columbia in 1881, and I have never 
since contemplated the possibility of getting rid of it. 

Will you permit me to call your attention to a short story 
of mine called "Liberty's Victim" (in the volume, "Vaga- 
bond Tales"), which preaches a pointed practical moral on 
this subject. I remain, with kind regards and good wishes, 
very sincerely yours, H. H. BOYESEN. 

With his usual frankness and cordiality, he here re- 
ferred " Nicodemus " to a story (the volume underlined, 
N. laughingly insists upon my mentioning, in an en- 
closed price-list of his " works ") of dismally blighted 
literary hopes, which he wrote presumably after he had 
experimented with hack-work as a sole means of sup- 
port, and had known its trials. Not so, however. " Vag- 
abond Tales," which were published in 1889, were writ- 
ten, Mr. Barry informs us, while Boyesen was yet pro- 
fessor at Cornell ; so that " Liberty's Victim," if indeed 
we do not entirely mistake its personal ring, proceeded 
from anxious anticipation, not the actual experiment, of 
burning his ships behind him. Voila. He expected 
a novice to profit from advice he had once given him- 
self and refused to follow. " Though Nestor swear the 
jest be laughable," as he must have done on the occa- 
sion in question, it does not detract from the sanity 
and wholesomeness of his judgment, in helping young 
men to find themselves. It only proves that he knew 
the futility of all advice ; opus est, enim, ad notitiam sui, 
experimento. Nor could he have overlooked the fine 
humor of the situation. 

As advice goes, however, whole oceans of which va- 
porize into nothing, Professor Boyesen's to young men 
was uncommonly potential, because it was generally the 
outgrowth of experience rather than observation. la 
his childhood he was prompted by an inordinate curi- 
osity to put his finger into a lawn-mower, to see how it 
worked. When he, in turn, transmitted to his own boys 
the parental injunction, " Don't get caught in the ma- 
chinery," blue eyes and flaxen curls must have reluc- 
tantly acquiesced. He left many nuts, too, for boys of 
the quill to crack. The literary novice may well pon- 
der the facts of Professor Boyesen's Sturm und Drang 
period. 

Frankness was the atmosphere of his life. Yet he 
was rarely blunt or curt, nor did he appear to carry his 
heart on his sleeve. That he was self-sufficient, and 
transmuted his wide observations into a microcosm of 
his own, denotes virility, not egotism. He lived his own 
life, in the Goethean, not the Emersonian, sense, assi- 
milating vitalizing materials from each new environ- 
ment. He was self-centred, as every artist must be, 
yet not insulated. He followed the shrewd counsel 
dropped by the Merry- Andrew in the prelude of Faust: 

" Reach deep and widely into human life, 
Every one lives it, few know it," 

and found, to judge from his tireless enthusiasm, 
" Wherever you put in your trowel, there it is interesting." 
He projected his life on a large scale; and why not, 
when his zest for living was so keen ? In 1889, his 
forty-first year, he published an essay on the " Meridian 
of Life," striking a mock-elegiac strain. " There is a 
touch of exquisitely cruel regret," he said, "in the 
thought that I am henceforth no more to be numbered 
among that happy throng to whom folly is becoming 
and permissible." Then he quoted Browning:

" Grow old along with me I 

The best is yet to be, 

The last of life for which the first was made." 
Cheerily hoping the full human allotment of years, at 
the half-way point he could talk exuberantly of the 
compensations of middle-life. 

Few men could so engage the popular attention with 
the exposition of their own daily emotions. This very 
note of frankness, his willingness to be subjectively 
committal, was a barrier to preeminent success in story- 
telling. As he confessed, he wrote his stories with his 
" heart-blood." They read so. One feels that, with the 
possible exception of "Gunnar," his one romance, they 
are too individualistic, we had almost said too personal, 
too roughly distilled in the alembic of his imagination. 
Like most men of affairs, he could not get far enough 
away from his subject to see it impassively, and, in the 
truest sense, mirror nature. The essay and discussion, 
rather, were his forte. When editor of " Framerd " in 
Chicago, in those early courageous days, he devoted 
himself " chiefly to denouncing denominational schools 
among the Norwegians," in which " crusade " he took 
" a great deal of pleasure." He was a born controver- 
sialist, who loved to startle his opponents by occasion- 
ally overstating his position, a species of criticism which, 
however entertaining, never fails to rouse sympathy for 
the cause against which one is pleading. Call Professor 
Boyesen "sensational," "cynical," if you will: by his 
pleasing sophistries he often helped others, on the re- 
bound, to find truth; and he was never, never stupid. 
His " Commentary on Ibsen," which, one might imagine 
from its name, would be loaded down with exegetical 
minutiae, is as readable as the happy little bundle of es- 
says entitled " Social Silhouettes." True, one may take 
exception to some portion of everything he wrote. He 
dealt inadequately, perhaps, with the ethics of Robert 
Browning, and he characterized Messrs. Crawford and 
Weyman as "mere purveyors of amusement." But this 
is simply saying that he had the defects of his qualities, 
among which were an intense interest in every social 
and literary problem ; his contemporaneity ; and a Ma- 
caulayan love of warm color and startling paradox. 
That he could daily rise so heroically above the " drudg- 
ery of the desk's dead wood " (I sometimes think Lamb 
by these words characterized the recitation-room as well 
as he did the counting-house), and, between lectures at 
Columbia, turn out, in wondrous succession and with 
apparent ease, essays, translations, poems, causerie, and 
even stories, crudely realistic as they may be, evinces 
a rare versatility and fecundity. 

Amidst all this activity, wearing ever so lightly the 
" professorial harness," he was glad to see his friends, 
and even the chance visitor who had a congenial errand. 
He was of kind service to many, especially of a younger 
generation, in admitting them to his refreshing com- 
panionship, just as he had himself been inspired by 
personal contact with Turgenieff, Ibsen, and Bjornsen. 
He would smilingly suspend his work, and show you 
his rare editions of " Faust," or of old Norse Sagas, ac- 
cording to your taste, with a running commentary of 
gossip and reminiscence, which, for fluency and good 
cheer, equalled any of his writings. On the wall facing 
his desk at Columbia were pinned as many as a hundred 
pictures of literary folk, from magazines and periodi- 
cals. To his American and European contemporaries 
he would point with an amused air, saying he could 
work better, " compassed about with so greaVa cloud of 



witnesses."

COMMUNICA TION. 

THE OBSTACLES TO INDIVIDUALITY IN 

TEACHING. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As a reader who for many years has tried to be a 
teacher in the highest sense of the word, and one who 
has had experience in the schools of several states, I 
wish to express the gratitude that all teachers must feel 
for the recognition so ably accorded by THE DIAL of the 
influence of Individualism in teaching, and its plea for 
wider scope in that direction. I firmly believe, how- 
ever, that the average superintendent and board of 
education are not only willing to allow, but wish to en- 
courage, capable teachers to exert their individuality. 
The trouble is that there are so few teachers who are 
" capable " in this direction ; and for this the conditions, 
not the teachers or the superintendents, are usually to 
blame. 

Owing to many things, chiefly the foreign influx and 
the mania of foreigners for placing their daughters 
above manual work, and above all the despicable poli- 
tical spoils system, there has been a lamentable defi- 
ciency in the quality of teachers, at least below the 
high school. The scholarship requirements have been 
of such a nature that any person with an average in- 
tellect could learn the necessary facts for examination 
and certificate purposes. Given a certificate and a 
" political pull," and the rest has been easy. 

Under existing conditions, how can persons of marked 
individuality be expected to choose the profession of 
teaching, or to remain in it ? No teacher can retain 
self-respect who is continually hampered by the trials 
incident to frequent changes, or whose salary is inade- 
quate to maintain herself and insure the means of in- 
creasing her general and special culture. In most of 
the states, the teacher below the high school rarely re- 
ceives, outside the largest cities, a higher salary than 
$450 a year, and it is more often $360. If she is self- 
supporting, her living expenses will exhaust at least 
$270 for the school year, clothing will consume (in- 
cluding shoes, gloves, and hats) another $100; travel- 
ling expenses, books and periodicals (and if she is re- 
quired to attend teachers' institutes this amount will be 
inadequate), $50. Although these are very low esti- 
mates, and no provision has been made for incidentals, 
$420 is needed to cover them. How-shall the teacher 
plan who receives but the $360 as salary, and must 
live through the vacations ? How can the teacher, 
however high her ideals, however fitted she may be for 
social pleasures and mental improvement, avail herself 
of the opportunities that may offer if any extra expense 
is entailed in the way of dress, books, or tickets ? Is 
not the young woman who has a good home and good 
education, but finds a little extra money desirable for 
dress or the future trousseau, the real enemy of the ideal 
teacher ? This young woman does not expect to make 
teaching a life-work, hence she lowers the standard of 
the profession. Her father, perhaps, holds political in- 
fluence in the district, and says, " What is the use of 
sending away for a teacher ? My daughter will take 
the school for less money than a stranger." This is 
especially true in rural schools. As objectionable as is 
the habit of text-book reliance, I believe most sensible 
people would prefer to have such teachers bound to it 
rather than to exercise their individuality on their 
children. ANNA LEMIRA MOORE.

SHERMAN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 

The two ponderous volumes of John Sher- 
man's autobiography are before us. The bur- 
den of the work is a very skilful and elaborate 
presentation of Mr. Sherman's leadership in 
dealing with the finances of the Government 
during his extended public service ; but other 
questions of interest receive due attention, and 
the reader is thus abundantly supplied with the 
material for a just estimate of the man. 

Mr. Sherman was one of eleven children, 
and was born at Lancaster, Ohio, on the 10th 
day of May, 1823. A particular account of 
his ancestors is given in his first chapter, but 
he says he cannot claim for them superior rank 
or wealth or ability, but that they were men of 
useful and honorable lives, of untarnished rep- 
utation, thorough republicans in the best sense 
of that word, and always for their country in 
every contest for the right. In dealing with 
his school days and early life, Mr. Sherman is 
singularly frank. He says he was regarded 
as a wild reckless boy and eager to fight, and 
that he frequently quarrelled and fought with 
one of his schoolmates. He had numerous 
controversies with his teachers, and was some- 
times punished with the ferrule and the switch. 
He was often more or less intoxicated, and in 
one instance excessively so, and was twice ex- 
pelled from school for inexcusable misconduct. 
In his early school days, however, first at Mt. 
Vernon and afterwards at Lancaster, he made 
considerable progress in his studies, especially 
in mathematics, and at the age of thirteen he 
began to develop his thrifty disposition. " If 
fortunes could be made by others," said he, 
" why could I not make one ? I wished I was 
a man. It began to appear to me that I could 
not wait to go through college. What were 
Latin and Greek to me, when they would delay 
me in making a fortune ? " Prompted by these 
feelings he succeeded, through the influence of 
his brother Charles, in getting the position of 
rodman under the chief engineer in charge 
of the improvement of the Muskingum river. 
He was then only fourteen, but proved equal 
to his duties, and after the survey was com- 
pleted he was entrusted with the supervision of 
a portion of the work. During the vacation

which was allowed him in the fall of 1838, he 
purchased a barge, and undertook the shipment 
of salt and other commodities to Cincinnati as 
a speculation, but the unexpected delay caused 
by the low water in the Ohio made the venture 
a losing one. In the election of this year the 
Democrats were successful, and a change in 
the board of public works deprived young Sher- 
man of his position. In the following year he 
determined to study law, and in 1840 entered 
upon his studies in Mansfield ; but as he could 
not be admitted to practice till he was twenty- 
one, he managed in the mean time to support 
himself by such odd jobs of miscellaneous busi- 
ness as fell in his way, without seriously neglect- 
ing his studies. He was admitted to the bar in 
1844, soon after he became of age, and entered 
into a prosperous business as the equal part- 
ner of his brother Charles. In this year he 
cast his first vote, and made his first political 
speech for Henry Clay. He was a Whig by 
inheritance and association, and he tells us that 
at this time he had but two definite ideas about 
politics : a hearty belief in the doctrine of pro- 
tection to American industries, and a strong 
prejudice against the Democratic party. 

On the slavery question the attitude of Mr. 
Sherman as a great Republican leader natur- 
ally awakens a peculiar interest. No man had 
less sympathy with abolitionism. By nature 
he was unimpassioned and conservative. The 
moral bearings of slavery gave him no concern. 
In 1848, when men of eminence from all other 
parties joined in forming a new one to prevent 
the spread of slavery over our national terri- 
tories, the movement had no significance for 
Mr. Sherman, who contentedly remained in the 
Whig party, and became a delegate to the 
national convention which voted down the Wil- 
mot Proviso and nominated for the Presidency 
a large slave-owner who was perfectly accept- 
able to the South. In 1850, when Congress 
balked this great uprising of the people of the 
Northern States by a compromise which aban- 
doned the Wilmot Proviso, and thus invited 
the repeal of the Missouri restriction which 
followed, Mr. Sherman gave his unhesitating 
approval to this betrayal of a great cause. In 
1852, when the Whig and Democratic parties 
joined hands in solemnly pledging themselves 
to oppose the further discussion of the slavery 
question, in Congress or out of Congress, when- 
ever, wherever, or however such discussion 
might be attempted, and under whatever shape 
or color the attempt might be made, Mr. Sher- 
man heartily indorsed these pledges, was a dele-

gate to the national convention which nominated 
General Scott, and an elector of his party. He 
always declared himself opposed to the aboli- 
tion of slavery in the District of Columbia, 
though always conceding the power of Con- 
gress to do it ; and when the events of the war 
brought the question to the front in 1862 he 
voted for the measure because it would add to 
the value of the property of the District and 
increase its population. The right of the ne- 
groes to their liberty seems not to have entered 
his thoughts. It is true that in 1854, when 
he was first elected to Congress by the Whigs 
and Know-Nothings of his district, he opposed 
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and 
afterwards demanded its restoration ; but so 
did thousands of conservatives like himself 
who were shocked by this attempt to remove 
an ancient landmark and renew the agitation 
that had been quieted by the final settlement 
of 1850. To oppose the repeal of the Missouri 
Compromise as the violation of a solemn com- 
pact, was one thing ; but to oppose it as a cold- 
blooded conspiracy for the spread of slavery 
over the continent was another and totally dif- 
ferent thing. 

That Mr. Sherman's opposition to slavery 
was not inspired by conviction, but grounded 
on political expediency, was made evident by 
his conduct while a candidate for Speaker in 
the Thirty-sixth Congress. A North Carolinian 
named Helper had written a book entitled 
" The Impending Crisis of the South : How to 
Meet It." Helper was not the champion of 
the negroes, and thought they ought to be colon- 
ized ; but he appealed to the poor whites of the 
South, of whom he was one, to organize against 
the crushing exactions of slavery. His argu- 
ments were unanswerable, and his facts in the 
main trustworthy ; and nothing could have 
seemed more innocent than the recommenda- 
tion of such a book by a man who was opposed 
to slavery even on economic grounds. But 
when Clarke of Missouri charged Republican 
members of Congress, including their candidate 
for Speaker, with recommending the book, and 
declared that the man who did it was not only 
unfit to be Speaker but unfit to live, the bal- 
loting for Speaker was suspended, and denials, 
apologies, and explanations abounded, as if 
slavery had been of divine appointment and 
the writing of such a book an unpardonable 
sin. Mr. Sherman did not think he had rec- 
ommended the book, but as he found his name 
printed along with other signatures he sup- 
posed he must have signed the paper. He 



finally stated that he signed it by proxy, but 
that he knew nothing of the contents of the 
book ; and he disclaimed any right on the part 
of the people of the Free States to meddle with 
the relation of master and slave in the South. 
This disclaimer was repeated and gratuitously 
reiterated during the protracted debate which 
followed ; and he made the remarkable state- 
ment that at the beginning of that session of 
Congress he did not believe the question of slav- 
ery would come up, and that but for Brown's 
raid at Harper's Ferry there would have been 
no feeling on the subject. In his mental be- 
wilderment he seems to have forgotten that the 
repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the bloody 
outrages in Kansas, and the brutal assault upon 
Charles Sumner, had created a commotion of 
which the affair at Harper's Ferry was a mere 
incident. His labors as a peace-maker were 
utterly thrown away. It was this spirit of 
conciliation in the presence of turbulence and 
threats which called forth the stinging rebuke 
of Northern members, by Thaddeus Stevens, 
for cowering before the studied bluster of the 
Southern leaders. 

But in justice to Mr. Sherman it should be 
remembered that he rendered invaluable ser- 
vice in the struggle to make Kansas a Free 
State. He was Chairman of the Congressional 
Committee which was sent to the territory to 
investigate the Border Ruffian outrages, and 
which dragged to the light a great mass of 
startling facts which powerfully and savingly 
influenced public opinion in the Northern 
States. His labors on the stump in the cam- 
paign of 1860 were untiring and effective, as 
they were a little later in the enlistment of re- 
cruits for the war. When the great conflict 
came, and the power he had vainly sought to 
propitiate struck at the Nation's life, his tim- 
idity gave place to courage, and he gave his 
whole heart and strength to the imperilled 
cause of the Union. He believed in prosecut- 
ing the war with the whole might of the nation, 
and he took an active and leading part in all 
the legislation of Congress during and following 
the struggle, including whatever acts affected 
the institution of slavery and the fortunes of 
the colored race. 

Mr. Sherman's strongest claim upon the 
gratitude of his country, however, is based 
upon his activity and leadership in managing 
the finances of the government during the war 
and thenceforward to the present time. His 
natural aptitude for financial studies was joined 
to tireless industry in the public service. He

was a zealous champion of the Legal-tender 
Act of 1862, and of our system of national 
banks. He took the lead in the work of fund- 
ing the public debt, as he did also in the re- 
sumption of specie payments. His labors both 
as Senator and Secretary of the Treasury are 
set forth with elaboration and detail in these 
two great volumes, including citations from the 
Congressional debates, copious extracts from 
his own speeches, letters from distinguished 
public men commending his action, and such 
explanations as he deemed called for in placing 
himself advantageously before the country. He 
may well be proud of his record, for it shows 
his prodigious industry and patience and the 
large measure, of success which followed. We 
do not mean to say, however, that he made no 
mistakes. He was wrong in espousing the 
Sherman Act, which proved so disastrous to 
the country. He had no faith in it, and in 
lending it his support on grounds of party ex- 
pediency the statesman was lost in the politi- 
cian. He was wrong again, as he now con- 
fesses, when he favored the payment of 5-20 
bonds in greenbacks. He is wrong to-day in 
opposing the retirement of our legal-tender 
notes, and thus lending the continued sanction 
of the government to the mischievous folly and 
delusion of an irredeemable paper currency. 
And we believe the sober judgment of history 
will pronounce him wrong in favoring the pas- 
sage of the Legal-tender Act of 18 b* 2. It was 
this legal attempt " to make something true 
which was false," and not Secretary McCul- 
loch's policy of contraction, as Mr. Sherman 
asserts, that gave birth to the greenback craze 
which demoralized both the great parties, de- 
luded the people, and finally found expression in 
the Supreme Court of the United States in its 
its opinion overruling the decision of Chief Jus- 
tice Chase in the case of Hepburn vs. Griswold. 
These volumes bear constant witness to Mr. 
Sherman's absolute loyalty to his party. If 
this is a virtue, no man has a better title to it. 
His career shows that he has been ambitious. 
In his long public life he has had many rival- 
ries and conflicts, and his aspirations for the 
presidency have been repeatedly disappointed ; 
but his devotion to his party has known no 
change. When it has gone astray, he has still 
followed it. When its chief leaders and found- 
ers felt compelled to leave it on account of 
the scandals of Grant's two administrations, 
he quietly and uncomplainingly followed its 
fortunes. While he was Secretary of the Treas- 
ury he removed Arthur and Cornell from the 



New York Custom House, on account of gross 
malfeasance in office ; but when Cornell after- 
wards became a candidate for Governor of New 
York, Mr. Sherman supported him in a series 
of public speeches. When this action was crit- 
icised by his friends, his defence was that " we 
must carry New York next year, or see all the 
results of the war overthrown and the consti- 
tutional amendments absolutely nullified." 
Kindred considerations induced him to support 
the Sherman Act. He did not approve the 
measure, but thought it would be of temporary 
advantage in preventing the passage of a bill 
for the free and unlimited coinage of silver. 
Such a bill would have to be acted upon by 
President Harrison, and his approval or veto 
of the measure would tend to divide and weaken 
the Republican party. That was his sole and 
anxious concern, for the President held in his 
hand the power to save the country from the 
free-silver madness. 

Mr. Sherman's loyalty to his party has a still 
more striking illustration in his action in 
Louisiana in the fall of 1876, respecting the 
famous Returning Board of that State. He was 
then in New Orleans as one of the " visiting 
statesmen " deputed by President Grant to su- 
pervise the action of this body in counting the 
vote of the State for President. The result 
of the national canvass was at stake, and Mr. 
Sherman knew that these were the same men 
who constituted the Board in 1874, and that 
after the election in that year they took the 
majority of votes from one side and gave it to 
the other, by unjust, arbitrary, and illegal ac- 
tion, as shown by a Republican Congressional 
Committee composed of Wheeler of New York, 
Hoar of Massachusetts, and Frye of Maine. He 
knew that Wells, the President of this Board, 
who had been Governor of the State under the 
reconstruction policy of President Johnson, 
had been summarily ejected from that office 
for violating an act of the Legislature respect- 
ing the repair of her levees, and seeking to 
prostitute the funds of the State to partisan 
purposes. He knew that this Returning Board 
had no power to reject the vote of any precinct 
unless the certificate from such precinct was 
accompanied by a sworn protest, signed by the 
supervisors, that intimidation had been prac- 
ticed ; and that in no single instance did the 
Commissioners of Election show a compliance 
with this requirement, without which Tilden 
had legally carried the State by seven thousand 
majority. But Mr. Sherman was working for 
his party. He believed, and so did the Repub-

licans throughout the country at that time, 
that the election of Tilden would be a national 
calamity, and that we should " see all the results 
of the war overthrown and the constitutional 
amendments absolutely nullified," as he had 
declared in speaking of the defeat of Cornell in 
New York. It was as impossible for Mr. Sher- 
man to consider the issue of the Louisiana elec- 
tion judicially as to add to his stature by tak- 
ing thought. Mr. Sumner used to say, "The 
slave of principle, I call no party master." 
Mr. Sherman might say with equal truth, " The 
slave of party, I call no principle master." 
That he attempts in this autobiography to de- 
fend his action in Louisiana simply proves that 
the party idolatry which blinded his vision in 
1876 has never been intermitted. 

Mr. Sherman refers to a meeting between 
General Thomas and General Sherman, at 
Williamsport, on the Potomac, early in June, 
1861. In the light of the past it now has a 
special interest. The interview took place at 
Mr. Sherman's lodgings in a country tavern. 
His brother, he says, 

"Then met for the first time in many years his old 
class-mate, Colonel, afterwards Major General, George 
H. Thomas, who then commanded a regular regiment 
of the United States army in the force under the com- 
mand of General Patterson. The conversation of these 
two officers, who were to be so intimately associated in 
great events in the future, was very interesting. They 
got a big map of the United States, spread it on the 
floor, and on their hands and knees discussed the prob- 
able salient strategic places of the war. They singled 
out Richmond, Vicksburg, Nashville, Knoxville, and 
Chattanooga. To me it has always appeared strange 
that they were able confidently and correctly to desig- 
nate the lines of operation and strategic points of a war 
not yet commenced, and more strange still that they 
should be leading actors in great battles at the places 
designated by them at this country tavern." 

Mr. Sherman's interest in the finances led 
to a particular intimacy between him and Sec- 
retary Chase, who figures largely in this auto- 
biography. It is pleasant to notice that their 
relations were those of friendship and mutual 
respect. 

Prior to the National Republican Conven- 
tion of 1880, Mr. Sherman's relations with 
Garfield were most friendly. He now says : 

" I knew Garfield well. From his early advent in 
1861 in the Legislature of Ohio, when I was a candi- 
date for the Senate, to the date of his death, I had every 
opportunity to study his character. He was a large, 
well-developed, handsome man, with a pleasing address 
and a natural gift for oratory. Many of his speeches 
were models of eloquence. These qualities naturally 
made him popular. But his will-power was not equal 
to his personal magnetism. He easily changed his mind, 
and honestly veered from one impulse to another. This, 



I think, will be admitted by his warmest friends. Dur- 
ing the trying period between his election and inaugur- 
ation his opinions wavered, but Elaine, having similar 
personal qualities but a stronger will, gained a powerful 
influence with him. When I proposed to him to be a 
delegate-at-large to the Chicago convention he no doubt 
meant in good faith to support my nomination. When 
his own nomination seemed probable, he acquiesced in, 
and perhaps contributed to it, but after his election he 
was chiefly guided by his brilliant Secretary of State." 

Mr. Sherman evidently believes that Gar- 
field secretly cooperated with his friends in 
securing his own nomination ; and as to this 
there is probably little diversity of opinion 
among intelligent men. The Presidency was 
too tempting a plum to turn away from when 
pressed upon him by his enthusiastic admirers. 
He yielded ; but he is not solely responsible. 
If Mr. Sherman's temperament had been more 
tropical, and his friends in Ohio and elsewhere 
had heartily and enthusiastically worked for 
his success, either he or Mr. Blaine would have 
been nominated, and no " dark horse " would 
have been thought of. Mr. Sherman, in tell- 
ing the story of his political defeats and arraign- 
ing other public men for their hostile action, 
should remember that he too has been an ex- 
emplar in the business of practical politics. 
He has had his literary bureaus, and has freely 
used all the appliances by which public opin- 
ion could be influenced in his behalf and the 
votes of delegates secured, whether in the 
Northern or Southern States. Indeed, if he 
had been less intensely devoted to his own am- 
bition, and less obsequious to the party which 
has so often failed him in times of trial, his 
chances of political success would probably have 
been improved. 

We have little space left for minor topics. 
In telling the story of his life, Mr. Sherman 
has evidently cared more about the accuracy 
of his facts than their literary expression. In 
the matter of style, his third chapter, giving a 
brief history of Ohio, is by far the best in the 
two volumes. The public will be glad to learn 
that Secretary Stanton and General Sherman 
became reconciled, and that during Stanton's 
last illness General Sherman called to see him. 
In stating that the Republican party was named 
at its Philadelphia convention of the fourth of 
July, 1856, Mr. Sherman is mistaken. It was 
named at its first national convention, which 
met at Pittsburg on the twenty-second of Feb- 
ruary of that year, organized the party, and 
issued the call for its first nominating conven- 
tion in the following July.

STUDIES OF BIRD TJ 



Any treatise in ornithology coming from the 
hand of Professor Elliot, the Curator of Zool- 
ogy in the Field Columbian Museum, bears the 
stamp of authority. The author has proved 
his capacity to deal with this branch of natural 
history by various monographs in special groups 
of birds peculiar to both the eastern and the 
western hemispheres. In his latest work, de- 
voted to " North American Shore Birds," he 
addresses a more popular audience than here- 
tofore, desiring particularly to meet the needs 
of sportsmen, and of the interested but unsci- 
entific observer of birds found on our coasts 
and along the shores of our inland waters. He 
has therefore adapted his book in every fea- 
ture to the requirements of these two classes of 
readers. 

The species described number upwards of 
seventy, all comprised in the order Limicolice. 
Among them are some of our choice game 
birds, woodcock, snipe, plover, etc. Each spe- 
cies is figured in a full-page engraving, which, 
with the accompanying life-history, ensures its 
easy recognition. There are furnished, besides, 
a key to the order, by which the name and 
place of any shore bird in hand may be deter- 
mined, an outline map plainly defining the sci- 
entific terms applied to its external features, 
and a glossary. The biographies are short and 
compact, simple in style, and enriched with 
incidents drawn from the author's own experi- 
ence. He has been from boyhood a student of 
shore birds, seeking them in their native haunts 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from 
Alaska to the plains of Mexico. There is con- 
sequently a freshness in much of the informa- 
tion given which renders it valuable to the 
naturalist as well as the inexperienced bird- 
lover. 

Among the whole number of species de- 
scribed, none are quite so curious in certain 
habits as the Phaleropes, of which there are 
three species, all partaking of the same strik- 
ing peculiarities. In his account of the North- 
ern Phalerope, Professor Elliot thus tells its 
strange story : 

" Early in May it arrives at the breeding grounds, 
and the females commence to make love to the appar-

ently indifferent males, using all the wiles and blandish- 
ments generally employed by one of the sterner sex 
(when bent on a like purpose) to gain the favor and 
seduce the affection of the object of its adoration. And 
the male is as coy and retiring as the most bashful 
maiden, turning away from the proffered attentions, 
first to this side, then to that, even flying to the oppo- 
site side of the pool, or to another near by; but all in 
vain, for he is followed by the fair one who has chosen 
him from his fellows, and there is no escape. He swims 
rapidly along, but she is ever near, and with arched 
neck circles about him, rising on wing at times and 
poising above him, and producing a sharp series of 
sounds by quick strokes of the pinions. At last, like 
any other poor bachelor so beset, he yields, and the 
nest, a slight structure of dry stalks, is placed in the 
centre of a thick tuft of grass. The eggs are four in 
number. . . . On these the poor male, a victim to 
woman's rights, is obliged to sit the greater part of the 
time, the female amusing herself on the pool near by." 

As a rule, male birds are handsomer than 
their mates ; and if there be a difference in 
their size, it is to his advantage. But the re- 
verse of this obtains among the Phaleropes. 
Only last spring the writer of this saw two 
Lady Wilson Phaleropes disputing over the 
possession of one of the opposite sex. They 
were in a tiny pool left by the rains in a grain- 
field, where they had dropped to rest and re- 
fresh themselves on their way up from the 
south. The ladies were elegantly attired and 
most graceful in every motion, while the little, 
shy, demure male, in a coat of plain colors, 
kept to himself and fed quietly at one side of 
the pool, apparently unmindful of the eager, 
not to say violent, behavior of the pair con- 
tending for his companionship. It was a singu- 
lar study in bird-life, suggesting amusing par- 
allels in human history. How or when this 
dominion of the female sex began among the 
Phaleropes is a question lost in an obscure an- 
tiquity. 

The manual on " British Birds," by Mr. "W. 
H. Hudson, might be called a companion piece 
to Chapman's " Handbook of the Birds of the 
Eastern United States," which won such gen- 
eral applause on its appearance last spring. 
Mr. Hudson's work is one to be commended 
without reserve, dainty in its exterior and val- 
uable in its contents. Within the compass of 
a duodecimo volume it compresses the most de- 
sirable special information concerning the birds 
which make their home for any portion of the 
year within the territory of the British Islands, 
and includes also the essential parts of the rudi- 
mentary science of ornithology. A prefatory 
chapter explaining the anatomy of a bird is 
from the skilful pen of an adept in such expo- 
sition, Mr. Frank E. Beddard, F.K.S. It is

couched in language so simple that a child 
should be able to comprehend and enjoy it. By 
way of conclusion, a brief account is added 
of the scheme of classification adopted by the 
ornithologists of England. Then follow con- 
densed sketches of the habits and manners of 
more than two hundred separate species of 
birds, beginning with the thrushes and ending 
with the auks. Each sketch is headed by a 
technical description of the bird under notice, 
and in many cases with an exquisite portrait 
in black and white. The volume is further 
illustrated by eight plates in color, which, like 
the drawings, are executed with admirable deli- 
cacy and truth. 

One has to read but a single chapter in 
" Game Birds at Home," by Mr. T. S. Van 
Dyke, to discern that the author treats his sub- 
ject with a sympathy equal to his knowledge. 
All the qualities of the true sportsman are his. 
First of these is a passionate love of Nature in 
every form and phase, and this prompts him 
to study her patiently and faithfully. He knows 
every tree and flower in the region around him, 
not only by its name but by its minutest fea- 
tures. He has the same familiar acquaintance 
with the animals, although with it he has the 
fondness of the hunter for bringing down his 
game. The book is written, in fact, from the 
sportsman's standpoint as though the author 
were talking to some fellow-sportsman, recount- 
ing, as such never tire of doing, exciting inci- 
dents in the field which have their date in the 
past, but renew their life in vivid recollections. 
It is to such comrades in spirit that the book 
will appeal, and probably with the same pleas- 
ant effect as have Mr. Van Dyke's previous 
works of a kindred character.

OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE.* 



It could have required no little courage in 
Miss Ruth Putnam, author of a new life of the 
Prince of Orange, to undertake to cover again 
the ground that Motley has made so peculiarly 
his own. The result, however, fully justifies 
her undertaking ; for the difference in point of 
view, the use of new material discovered since 
Motley wrote, the biographic form of the work, 
and the newer method of historical writing, 

* WILLIAM THE SILENT, PRINCE OF ORANGE. The Mod- 
erate Man of the Sixteenth Century. The Story of his Life 
as Told from his own Letters, from those of his Friends and 
Enemies, and from Official Documents. By Ruth Putnam. 
In two volumes. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



all make the book a distinct contribution to 
our knowledge of the man and the period in 
which he lived, and to American scholarly 
achievement. 

Miss Putnam has followed Motley quite 
closely through the tangled politics of the time, 
the relations of the several provinces to one 
another, to Spain and to outside countries, and 
the patient efforts of the Prince of Orange to 
unite them against the oppressor ; but she has 
read in those same documents some different 
motives and characteristics that give her por- 
trait of the Prince another aspect and a new 
interest. Yet it is the same man that appears 
in these pages, and our estimate of his great- 
ness is confirmed by the result of this different 
treatment. For Miss Putnam does not write with 
the blind enthusiasm of the hero-worshipper, 
but with an excess of caution against that very 
enthusiasm. One cannot imagine her giving 
those thrilling dramatic pictures in which Mot- 
ley's volumes abound, and when she even ap- 
proaches enthusiasm she seems to hold herself 
up lest she should be betrayed out of her self- 
contained and almost plodding gait. There is 
in this work nothing of the grand style of the 
classic historians, but a plain, judicial account 
of the man and his work, his perplexities and 
disappointments, his patient steadfastness when 
everything seemed lost, his growth from abso- 
lutism and religious indifference to liberalism 
and spirituality. Strong as is the fascination 
of Motley's brilliant word-pictures, one turns 
almost with relief from his strains of unmixed 
eulogy to the cool account in these volumes, 
where defects are pointed out as well as excel- 
lences, and no attempt is made to cover over 
the weaknesses of the great leader. Accord- 
ingly, we have here " the man under the dust 
of the past," and not a glorified heroic portrait. 

The key to Miss Putnam's conception of the 
Prince of Orange is found in the sub-title of 
her book. It is a moderate man that she sees 
in him, a cautious and conservative statesman, 
whose career is a gradual development, whose 
opposition to his king was forced upon him, 
and not a religious or political enthusiast who 
worked up a revolution. While Motley makes 
his opposition to Spanish tyranny mainly relig- 
ious, dating from the revelations of the French 
king in the forest of Vincennes, Miss Putnam 
attributes it to his indignation at the invasion 
of the political rights of the Netherlands, and 
fails to see much of heart religion in him until 
the later years of his life. That utterance of 
his which is taken for the motto of this work 



1895.] 



THE DIAL 



331 



shows his character, and in the sixteenth cen- 
tury could have been uttered only by a moder- 
ate man who cared more for the essentials of 
religion than for the differences that made the 
divisions of the Christian church bitterly hos- 
tile to one another: "This difference is too 
slight for you to remain separated." His train- 
ing could well have made him tolerant beyond 
his age, for he was born of earnest Lutheran 
parents, was reared a Catholic, and then in the 
course of his life-struggle was led back through 
Lutheranism to Calvinism. His moderate con- 
servatism made him an object of distrust to 
the partisans on both sides, and often seemed 
likely to destroy his influence with the people. 
But when the radical partisans had brought 
disaster upon their cause, the weight of Will- 
iam's character, the evident sincerity of his 
devotion to the popular cause, and the proved 
wisdom of his advice, brought them back to 
him with renewed confidence. 

Another of William's qualities, barely no- 
ticed by other writers but given almost undue 
prominence by Miss Putnam, is his craving for 
sympathy. It was indeed a characteristic, as his 
letters plainly show, but hardly so excessive as 
to become the weakness this book would make 
it. On the other hand, Miss Putnam is not 
blinded to the self-seeking ambition and the 
Macchiavellian subtlety that in more than one 
instance marred the fair outline of his career. 
For example, Motley cannot explain his leav- 
ing his oldest son in the power of the Spaniards 
when he fled from the Netherlands ; but Miss 
Putnam acknowledges that he probably risked 
his son in the hope that he might save his 
Netherland estates. 

A pathetic feature of William's career is 
that it was cut off before he could know that 
all his sacrifices and his suffering would result 
in success, and that he had made for himself 
one of the great names of history. Things 
were almost at their worst in the summer of 
1584, after the deceptive successes of the pre- 
ceding year. Washington and Lincoln lived 
to know that they had founded and saved their 
country. William left all in confusion and 
even apparent decline, the southern provinces 
back under the Spanish rule, and the northern 
despondent and not yet roused to the despera- 
tion that finally was too much for even Par- 
ma's genius and Philip's stubborn determina- 
tion. The northern union that at last won 
national independence was organized against 
his wishes, for his ideal was unity and freedom 
for all the provinces. 



Miss Putnam's work is a genuine biography, 
and not a history masquerading under a false 
name. Much attention is given to William's 
domestic affairs, and much of the interest of 
the book lies in its direct and indirect descrip- 
tions of the Nassau family the noble mother 
and brothers, and the close ties, reaching almost 
the clannish spirit, that bound them together, 
the spirit of mutual devotion and self-sacrifice. 
The story of William's four marriages and of 
his married life is also most interesting, and 
reveals much as to his character. All but one 
of these marriages were politic, and only in 
that one did he find the sympathy and comfort 
that he craved. His second wife, Anne of 
Saxony, was a thoroughly bad woman. 

The publishers have given the work a most 
fitting and beautiful dress, and enriched it with 
more than fifty portraits, copies of old prints, 
and fac similes. Altogether it is a very satis- 
factory piece of work, and deserves high com- 
mendation. CHARLES H. COOPER. 



PHENOMENA AND PROBLEMS OF SOCIETY.* 

The methods of grouping the phenomena of so- 
ciety are by no means settled. Each author ar- 
ranges the same material in a different way. Out 
of the conflict and comparison of many forms of 
analysis we shall secure a better form than any yet 
devised. In "Social Theory," Dr. Bascom em- 
ploys a method very similar to the one used in his 
earlier work on " Sociology," but here the analysis 
has been carried much further. Five groups of 
social factors are treated: Customs, Economics, 
Civics, Ethics, and Religion. All the phenomena

of social life are regarded as coming within these 
groups, and as belonging to them by virtue of in- 
herent likeness. The analysis of phenomena and 
the interpretation of their existence are not treated 
apart from recommendations as to their improve- 
ment. These recommendations are put forward as 
the chief purpose of the treatise. The social move- 
ments of reform are treated under the factors of 
society, the reform of the press, socialism, single 
tax, the labor movement to secure shorter hours 
and higher wages, profit-sharing, extension of poli- 
tical control over monopolies, charities, corrections, 
education, improvements in taxation, arbitration of 
national disputes, religious progress and influence. 
The author's long experience in public affairs, his 
wide reading, his reflection on events, his shrewd 
insight, have enriched his pages with many sugges- 
tive and thought-provoking sentences. Many of 
the metaphors carry one's mind into the heart of a 
great theme and assist the memory in retaining the 
impression. For popular presentation, the dog- 
matic and oracular style of treatment is effective 
and suitable. But a careful reading compels one 
to ask for further discussion and different method. 
The definition of sociology (page 8) is, " a knowl- 
edge of the facts of society, the order in which they 
follow one another, and their causes and reasons." 
The author begins each part with a discussion of 
facts and their causal explanation, but everywhere 
his mind goes far beyond the limits of his definition, 
for he erects ideals for the future and seeks to have 
them realized in action. The definition is not large 
enough for his book, and it is not the book which 
is blamed. The standard and touchstone of social 
conduct is given at the start (page 3), as "that 
final, comprehensive product the public welfare." 
In every chapter this idea controls the current of 
thought. Domestic activity, customs, political and 
economical methods, church work, are all compelled 
to pass under this measure. And yet one will 
search the book in vain for a clear and definite 
statement of the elements which enter into this 
criterion of welfare. No doubt all the essential 
elements are implicit in the discussion, but the aim 
of the author would have been made more clear and 
powerful by a complete and explicit analysis of a 
very complex conception. He has made an import- 
ant advance beyond his earlier work, in giving a 
more prominent place to the domestic institution ; 
and many of his suggestions are very instructive 
and inspiring. But he places the discussion under 
the head of " Customs " and along with " Classes." 
It would be difficult to imagine a more incongruous 
or illogical arrangement. The title of the part 
does not cover the contents. His method confines 
him (page 5) to "phases of progress offered by 
our own and by English society," and some of the 
most important arguments for monogamic marriage 
come from its earlier history. One often agrees 
with the writer in his conclusions, while objecting 
to the method of reaching them. Just now, in 
the study of sociology, we need fact rather than 



wings, statistical method and historical investigation 
more than rapid flights from premises assumed to 
conclusions desired. At the present stage of the 
science, the method is of supreme moment ; and for 
special students the method of this book is not be- 
yond criticism. With all abatements due to defects 
of the author (or of the critic), we have here a work 
which will be read, and which all interested in so- 
cial thought and social reform will find helpful. It 
will assist the wholesome tendency of our time to 
regard every question in the light, not of class in- 
terests, but of the common welfare. And this com- 
mon welfare is defined in terms of the highest and 
noblest achievements of the human spirit, and not 
in terms of savage life or benumbed spirituality. 

An exceedingly useful work on " Statistics and 
Sociology " is given us by Professor Mayo-Smith. 
The scientific mind is never satisfied until the forces 
which are the objects of study have been measured. 
There are many very important facts which cannot 
be brought into mathematical formulas, but the 
unscientific thinker is too easily contented with a 
general description when an accurate statistical con- 
clusion might be reached if only we take pains 
enough. From a vast range of reliable sources, 
Professor Mayo - Smith, an expert in statistical 
methods, has brought together a mass of ordered 
materials which bear on social problems ; and stu- 
dents of sociology are deeply his debtors. Many 
vague notions and insecure theories will be tested by 
the yard-stick of this book, and no serious worker 
can afford to ignore it. Early in the book (page 6) 
there is a " classification of social phenomena." 
While the author is careful to indicate that the 
" method of statistical observation is not of uni- 
versal application," the unpracticed reader needs to 
have the suggestion emphasized. By virtue of its 
purpose, the book itself may produce in some minds 
the impressions that the phenomena which are " im- 
ponderable " are non-existent or unimportant. The 
classification as given is sufficient for a bare out- 
line, and will suggest the place where-the measured 
facts belong ; but the more ample treatment of Spen- 
cer, De Greef, and Schaffle should be constantly 
compared. It is a distinct merit of the work that 
the data compiled are arranged in a way to excite 
interest and lead to results. At the beginning of 
each chapter the mind is awakened by the question, 
What is the purpose of this investigation ? Then 
the available data bearing on the problem are given 
and are sifted by scientific tests, while in the " re- 
flective analysis " the results are summarized. Under 
the head " Demographic," the relevant material in 
respect to sex, age, and conjugal condition, births, 
marriages, deaths, sickness, and mortality, are pre- 
sented. Under the title " Social " we have a simi- 
lar treatment of social condition (families and dwell- 
ings, education, religious confessions, occupations), 
the infirm and dependent, suicide, and crime. Race 
and nationality, and migration, come under the 
rubric " Ethnographic "; and the closing book on 
" Environment " discusses population and land

(physical environment), and population and civil- 
ization (social environment). In a second volume 
the author proposes to cover the ground of " statis- 
tics of commerce, trade, finance, and economic social 
life generally." Its appearance will be awaited 
with eager interest. In the present work, the treat- 
ment suffers from the absence of a distinct concep- 
tion of the standards and criteria pf social welfare. 
Nowhere do we find stated with sufficient clearness 
the test of the worth of a social arrangement or ten- 
dency. The criteria by which the accuracy of sta- 
tistics themselves is to be judged are given by the 
author ; but the " reflective analysis " would yield 
a clearer result if we were told more definitely on 
what principles the actions, customs, and institutions 
are to be held as more or less valuable to society. 

"Evolution and Effort," by Mr. Edmund Kelly, 
concludes with a summary of the argument : " No 
human being is so circumstanced but that he can 
contribute to make life less hard for those about 
him ; that it is to religious sentiment, and to relig- 
ious sentiment alone, whether within the pale of 
the Church or without, that humanity can look for 
the exercise of the self-restraint necessary for this 
end ; that human suffering can be dealt with most 
efficaciously by the action of the State." The min- 
isters of the churches should help in the organiza- 
tion of non-partisan and unsectarian associations 
for the study of social needs and promoting the 
efficiency of the municipal and other local govern- 
ments. Some of the particular discussions are very 
suggestive and stimulating, as, for example, the 
author's recommendations in respect to pauper col- 
onies. The speculative elements are not always 
sharply distinguished from the judgments resting 
on facts, and one feels in reading such books that 
he has, after all, only the individual opinion of an 
intelligent man. 

The sermon form is not adapted to exhaustive 
and systematic discussions of social science, and the 
clerical temperament is not, as a rule, judicial. So 
much is illustrated in " A Lent in London," by the 
Rev. H. S. Holland and others. And yet it is a 
valuable collection of sermons, and the pages glow 
with inspiration and sympathy. If one turns to 
these pages for definite social programmes, he will 
be disappointed. There is some erroneous and her- 
etical economics, some vague declamation. But 
these men live near the people. One of them was 
a layman before he was a clergyman, and says : " I 
have tried, even after I was ordained, to preserve 
my common sense." His contribution proves that 
he succeeded, for Mr. Boiling's ordination did not 
prevent him from uttering most unpalatable truths 
in a wholesome way. The tendency of this volume 
is toward the " socialistic " camp ; at least, com- 
munity direction of community interests is strongly 
urged. The book will kindle that passion for hu- 
manity which is the sustaining motive of social in- 
vestigation and of humane service after the truth 
has been found and formulated. 

" The Evolution of Industry," by Mr. H. Dyer, 



is an attempt to show the relation of economic in- 
terests to the general interests of society, and to 
depict the process of development from lower to 
higher stages. The common welfare is set forth as 
the goal of all social efforts, and this welfare in- 
cludes all the satisfactions of man's physical and 
spiritual nature. A rapid survey of the physical 
conditions of progress is followed by a discussion of 
the historical growth of the modern industrial sys- 
tem out of the mediaeval methods. This survey in- 
cludes a treatment, very brief and general, of guilds, 
the domestic industry, the factory system, trades 
unions, the work of women, cooperation, municipal 
and state control, and industrial training. The two 
concluding chapters on industrial guilds and indus- 
trial integration are the prophetic portions. Here 
the author passes, and without very distinct notice, 
from description and interpretation of past facts to 
a personal opinion of what ought to be in the future. 
His purpose is rather to show the logic of events 
and the drift of the period than to test the value of 
particular movements. The conclusion is : " The 
society of the not very distant future will have an 
admixture of individualism, trades unionism, coop- 
eration, and municipal and state socialism. The 
present duty of all social reformers is to educate 
public opinion in the direction of their ideals." 

The Catholic Church, under the leadership of 
great bishops and the Pope, is thoroughly committed 
to a discussion of industrial questions. Professor 
Nitti's work on u Catholic Socialism " is now trans- 
lated from the Italian for readers of English. While 
it is somewhat declamatory in style, it is very im- 
portant. The various forms of ecclesiastical activity 
in respect to the labor question, on the continent, 
in Great Britain, and in America, are carefully de- 
scribed, and the bibliography is very complete. 
Here is a power to be counted with, and those who 
wish to understand it will peruse these chapters 
with keen interest. 

The German insurance laws have attracted the 
attention of the civilized world, and provoked dis- 
cussion of state aid to workingmen in countries 
which have usually avoided " paternal " legislation. 
The schemes for old-age pensions which bear the 
influential names of Charles Booth and Joseph 
Chamberlain have been the theme of much discus- 
sion in England, and governmental inquiries and 
proposals have brought the topic within the field of 
practical politics. There is no consensus of opinion 
on the subject. Mr. Geoffrey Drage, in his book 
on " The Problem of the Aged Poor," makes a con- 
tribution of considerable interest to the discussion ; 
and our situation in America is not so different from 
that in Europe that we can safely pass it by with- 
out attention. As our cities grow larger and more 
numerous, we shall be seeking a method of caring 
for honest people in old age without the humilia- 
tions attending the reception of public and private 
charity. Mr. Drage has, before proposing his own 
position, carefully stated the arguments of all the 
more important schools of thought, and has collected 



334 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



data for independent judgment. First of all, the 
facts relating to the extent and causes of old-age 
pauperism are related, and the social apparatus for 
dealing with it in England is desci-ibed the poor 
law, charity, and thrift. The inquiries of the Royal 
Commission and of Mr. Charles Booth are com- 
pared. In Part II. we have a succinct and clear 
statement and criticism of the various schemes pro- 
posed in England by Mr. Chamberlain, Canon 
Blackley, Mr. C. Booth, Mr. Bartley, Mr. Wilkin- 
son, and Professor Marshall. The accounts of the 
poor-law and workingmen's insurance in Germany 
and Denmark are too brief to be entirely satisfactory, 
and need to be supplemented by the study of Mr. 
John Graham Brooks. Mr. Drage does not favor 
state pensions, because he thinks they are not nec- 
essary, that they would tend to destroy the inde- 
pendent friendly societies and the spirit of self-help 
which they represent, and that they are impracti- 
cable. He believes that with a vigorous use of the 
poor-law machinery pauperism will continue to be 
reduced in amount, and that the energy of the la- 
boring population and their societies will gradually 
take care of the infirm and aged. But the grounds 
of a different conclusion are fairly stated. Unfor- 
tunately, the experiments on the Continent are too 
young to help us far toward a conclusion. 

Mr. John Cummings has done a careful piece of 
work in his account of the poor-law methods in New 
York and Massachusetts. The systems adopted 
in the early history of those two states differed in 
important particulars in relation to the local and 
general authorities. This difference in principle 
reappears in the legislation of the newer states 
which have followed New York or Massachusetts in 
these matters. It was worth while to trace the de- 
velopment of both plans from the colonial period 
to the present time, and the author has done this 
with great care, drawing his information at first- 
hand from documents and original authorities. In 
the appendix the immigration and contract-labor 
laws are printed. 

The discussion of Ernest von Halle on Trusts in 
the United States appeared first in the publications 
of the German " Verein f iir Social-Politik," and his 
positions have already been examined. The pres- 
ent book is more than a translation of the original 
essay, and contains important additional material. 
We have a review of the earlier attitude toward mon- 
opolies in this country ; of the progress of trusts 
before the recent anti-trust legislation ; the various 
forms of organization, loose and amorphous associa- 
tions, formal contractual agreements, and combina- 
tions where all interests are connected in temporary 
or permanent pooling and concentrating arrange- 
ments ; the natural, quasi-natural and legal monop- 
olies, and the economic causes which call them into 
existence. The author believes that while protec- 
tive tariffs and advantageous bargains with rail- 
roads have affected the growth of trusts and pools, 
" these are only two of the many points to be con- 
sidered, and not even the most prominent ones. . . . 



They may rightly be called capitalistic combina- 
tions." The chief motives which lead to these com- 
binations are larger and surer profits, while the 
desire for power and social position, in a country 
which does not particularly honor distinction in 
political or literary or scientific fields, is a strong 
incentive. Even in the absence of trusts, the small 
producer must often succumb to the larger indus- 
try, for in many lines the great capital can produce 
more cheaply than the small capital. The author 
does not spare criticism of the defects and abuses 
of trusts, and is specific in his charges against sev- 
eral of them, as the Standard Oil, Sugar, and Dis- 
tillery trusts. A chapter is devoted to the legisla- 
tion and judicial decisions on the subject, and an- 
other to public opinion in respect to combinations. 
In the appendix, valuable documents and a full 
biography are printed. The author does not at- 
tempt to foretell the future, but recommends that 
the present anti-trust legislation be repealed, because 
it has proved inefficient and leads to immorality 
in politics and to disrespect for law. His general 
attitude as to remedial measures is shown in this 
sentence : " No author has conceived better the 
meaning of the corporation problem for the Com- 
monwealth than Henry C. Adams. He asks for 
publicity, publication of the results and the ways in 
which they were reached, a control through public 
bodies, and a responsibility of the individual mem- 
ber of the administration of the corporation for the 
observance of the necessary restrictions." 

The papers read before the International Con- 
gress of Charities, Correction, and Philanthropy, 
were valuable contributions of specialists in various 
departments, and they are printed in several vol- 
umes. We have before us the discussions on "The 
Care of Dependent, Neglected, and Wayward Chil- 
dren " and " Sociology in Institutions of Learning." 
This part is particularly interesting and valuable to 
those whose benevolent work lies in the most hope- 
ful field of philanthropy, the care of the young. 
Mr. Homer Folks, whose success in Pennsylvania 
is so well known, contributes two papers on family 
life for dependent and wayward children. It would 
help to clear the atmosphere in Illinois if his judg- 
ment were followed, and our commonwealth would 
honor itself by asking him and Mr. Birtwell to 
serve on a commission to draft a plan of state care 
of such children. No subject is of deeper concern 
for us just now, and if this book could be carefully 
studied in women's clubs this winter it would assist 
in directing public opinion along the right path. 
The essays on instruction in social subjects show 
that colleges have made great advance of recent 
years, and that the stubborn conservatism of the 
theological schools begins to melt a little under the 
genial rays of modern humanitarianism. But much 
of the instruction is still desultory and fragment- 
ary. The truths hidden in the glad message, how- 
ever, will find a voice in due time, and men will 
draw the conclusions from the abstract principles 
which they teach. C. R. HENDERSON.

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

i. 

The approach of Christmas-tide again brings 
round the pleasant, if always rather perplexing, 
task of preparing a summary descriptive list of the 
new Holiday publications. As heretofore, the ear- 
lier arrivals are given priority of 'notice in our col- 
umns, the later ones being reserved for the issue of 
December 16. At the present writing the indica- 
tions are that this year, as last, publishers generally 
are well on the conservative side, both as to the 
amount and the costliness of their output ; the ten- 
dency being still in the direction of prettily-mounted 
and moderate-priced reprints of old favorites. And 
what better gift is there for any time or occasion 
than a tasteful copy of a good book? The cum- 
brous, highly-ornate, and correspondingly expensive 
quartos and folios once so abundant on the Christ- 
mas counters are this season conspicuously wanting 
a fact due perhaps as much to sounder taste on 
the part of the public as to prudential considera- 
tions on that of the publishers. But while the Holi- 
day output is naturally rather smaller and more 
modest than in years of " booming " trade and as- 
sured returns, it is still large enough in all con- 
science, and attractive enough to make the " em- 
barrassment of riches," as usual, an obstacle in the 
way of choice. We may add that our impression 
is that in no former season has the general average 
of taste in the production of this class of publica- 
tions been higher. 

By all odds the most sumptuous publication on 
our Holiday list is Messrs. Harper & Brothers' 
" The Abbey Shakespeare," in four volumes, large 
octavo ; being the comedies of Shakespeare, richly 
illustrated by Mr. Edwin A. Abbey. The text is 
that of the folio of 1623, with patent errors cor- 
rected, and the spelling modernized. Connoisseurs 
of book-making may well linger over the material 
and pictorial charms of this exquisite work a 
really monumental one in point of luxurious equip- 
ment and artistic finish. The illustrations com- 
prise 131 superb full-page reproductions in photo- 
gravure of Mr. Abbey's usually admirable drawings, 
which display throughout the artist's characteristic 
lightness and daintiness of handling and fancy, as 
well as a minute and scholarly regard to historical 
accuracy in point of costumes and settings, and ac- 
cessories and " properties " in general, that will 
meet the approval of those who are nice in these 
incidental though considerable matters. Mr. Ab- 
bey's conceptions are pleasing as a whole, refined 
and graceful rather than striking, and never degen- 
erating into burlesque. Perhaps there is an occa- 
sional want of breadth and virility notably in his 
Falstaff (a marked departure, by the way, from the 
traditional ideal), which certainly lacks the richness, 
the unctuous Rabelaisian humor, with which Grtttz- 
ner, the delineator par excellence of Falstaff, has 
endowed the fat knight. But Grtitzner, again, must 
have made strange work of the poet's finer and 



daintier conceptions, the lovely women, and creat- 
ures of the fancy Katherine, Miranda, Anne Page, 
Titania and her train ; and here Mr. Abbey's lighter 
pencil is at home. These beautiful volumes, how- 
ever, must be seen and examined to be appreciated. 
They are distinctly a credit to American book mak- 
ing ; and we congratulate artist and publishers on 
a work which this season may be, all in all, safely 
pronounced hors concours. 

Our Holiday list of 1891 was headed by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co.'s " Elizabethan Songs," a, 
choice piece of book-making that the reader is not 
likely to have forgotten ; and this season no less 
hearty praise, for beauty, taste, and general attrac- 
tiveness, seems to us to belong to the same firm's 
" Victorian Songs," a companion volume to the 
above, and at all points a fit casket for the gems it 
contains. Mr. Edmund H. Garrett is again the 
editor and illustrator, and Mr. Edmund Gosse suc- 
ceeds the ubiquitous Mr. Lang as writer of the In- 
troduction. The volume a comely octavo hand- 
somely printed on special hand-made paper, and 
chastely bound in white and gilt follows the form 
set by its predecessor. The pictorial and decorative 
features comprise twenty full-page photogravure 
plates, an ornamental title-page in red and black 
with etched portrait of Queen Victoria, four vig- 
nette etchings for Introduction, table of contents, 
etc., and some fifty dainty head and tail pieces from 
pen-and-ink drawings. Mr. Garrett's designs are, 
as usual, graceful and pretty, rather than strong ; 
the bits of sea-view and landscape being notably 
good better, to our notion, than the figures. Space 
limits considered, the anthology is all that could be 
asked. Lightly skimming the long gamut of Vic- 
torian song, from such master-singers as Tennyson, 
Swinburne, and Landor, down to such lesser names 
as Domett and William Bell Scott, Mr. Garrett fur- 
nishes, enough certainly to bear out Mr. Gosse's 
rather high estimate of the lyrical achievement of 
the period. The latter's Introduction is a thought- 
ful and conscientious piece of literary criticism, 
that adds decidedly to the value of a beautiful and 
well-conceived book, which is not far from our ideal 
of what, in a general way, a Holiday book should be. 

Mr. Timothy Cole's masterly series of engravings 
after "Old Dutch and Flemish Masters," which 
have for some time past formed the leading picto- 
rial feature of " The Century Magazine," are com- 
bined in a handsome and enduring art-book (Cen- 
tury Co.). There are thirty plates in all : five after 
Rembrandt, three after Hals, three after Rubens, 
three after Van Dyck, one each after Cuyp, Potter, 
Hobbema, Ruisdael, Steen, Dou, Ostade, and so on. 
Mr. Cole's skill shows throughout the flawless work- 
manship, the delicate rendering of individualities 
of mind and handling, that make his earlier series 
after the Italian painters probably the best extant 
group of translations of those works. Fidelity to 
the originals has plainly been Mr. Cole's ideal; 
and it is interesting to note that to secure this he 
has availed himself, in an ingenious and perfectly 



336 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



legitimate way, of photography. In each case he 
has prepared his engraving with the original paint- 
ing hefore him, the photograph being thrown upon 
the block and its errors and deficiencies corrected 
by constant comparison with the original. Mr. 
Cole's fidelity to his models is not, however, merely 
mechanical. His work has been not only the pa- 
tient exercise of a refined handicraft, but a labor of 
love and artistic zeal, an effort to grasp and trans- 
fer the breath and finer spirit of the great works 
before him. While the plates in the present work 
as a whole necessarily fall short of Mr. Cole's Ital- 
ian series in the ideal beauty and elevation of sen- 
timent peculiar to the genius of that school, their 
subjects are less familiar, and they offer exceptional 
advantages to actual students of art. In the mas- 
tery of pure technique the painters of Holland and 
Flanders have rarely been approached, and never 
excelled. Except the engraver's pithy and charac- 
teristic notes, the text of the present volume is fur- 
nished by Professor John C. Van Dyke which is 
equivalent to saying that it is precisely the element 
of sound, serious, and scholarly criticism and appre- 
ciation needed to supplement Mr. Cole's work and 
give it its full educative value. Besides the de- 
scriptive matter accompanying each engraving, Pro- 
fessor Van Dyke provides an Introduction of some 
fourteen pages, which is not only a brilliant piece 
of writing, but the best condensed critical and com- 
parative summary of Dutch Art that we can recall. 

Messrs. George Bell & Co.'s " Masterpieces of 
Great Artists" (imported by Macmillan), uniform 
in make-up with their popular " Raphael's Madon- 
nas " of last year, is a rather sumptuous volume, 
the aim of which is to bring together trustworthy 
reproductions of representative mediaeval and re- 
naissance masterpieces. There are forty-two illus- 
trations, representing thirty-one painters ; and the 
reproductions have in each case been made from 
photographs of the originals, and not from copies 
or engravings. Eight of the plates are in pho- 
togravure, and the rest in half-tone, the former 
being excellent examples of the process, while two 
or three of the latter among them, unfortunately, 
Raibolini's (Francia's) fine Pieta, of the London 
National Gallery are slightly marred in the print- 
ing. The average, however, is high, and the sub- 
jects have been well chosen. Notably good plates 
are : Holbein's " The Meier Madonna "; the superb 
"Bacchus and Ariadne " of Titian ; Moroni's " Por- 
trait of a Tailor "; Rembrandt's " Portrait of an 
Old Woman "; and " The Creation of Man," detail 
from the Sistine Chapel frescoes. The text, com- 
prising a brief Introduction and a page or so of de- 
scription and comment with each illustration, is by 
Mrs. Arthur Bell, better known to art readers by 
her pseudonym, N. D'Anvers. 

An acceptable addition to the literature of Na- 
poleonic times is "The Romance of Prince Eugene " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.), in two octavo volumes, trans- 
lated from the French of M. Albert Pulitzer, by 
Mrs. B. M. Sherman. While the work is not a 



Holiday publication in the strict sense of that rather 
elastic term, its sumptuous setting and pictorial 
attractions make it a handsome and suitable gift- 
book. Eugene Beauharnais was an estimable and 
amiable man, whose private and domestic virtues 
won additional lustre from their comparative rarity 
among his compeers ; and it is the graceful and ro- 
mantic side of his character, as reflected in his let- 
ters to his wife, the beautiful Princess Augusta of 
Bavaria, that is mainly brought to view in the pres- 
ent work. " All the world loves a lover," and it is 
pleasant to note that these letters, written during 
the stirring scenes and anxieties of the Napoleonic 
epopee, and amid the trials and perils of the great 
campaigns in which the writer participated, are true 
love-letters to the end, one of the latest of them 
closing with the sentiment, " Our mutual love is the 
only sure happiness that we can look forward to." 
The author has drawn a graphic and pleasing pic- 
ture of Eugene, sketching his career in sufficient 
detail, and weaving into the narrative many strik- 
ing episodes of the times. The volumes are ele- 
gantly bound in sea-green cloth, stamped with em- 
blematic designs in crimson and gold ; and the text 
is well printed on excellent paper. There are twelve 
portraits, including Prince Eugene, the Princess 
Augusta, Josephine, Hortense, Murat, Pauline and 
Elise Bonaparte, Mme. Bonaparte, Eugene's chil- 
dren, and others. 

It is pretty difficult to tell whether the pictorial 
or the literary element of the large octavo volume 
" Pictures of Rustic Landscape " (Longmans) is to 
be considered its leading feature and real raison 
d'etre. The former element consists of thirty full- 
page woodcuts after Mr. Birket Foster; and the 
latter of as many passages in prose or verse, selected 
by Mr. John Davidson, and possessing a correspond- 
ence more or less close (or remote) with the text. 
From either point of view the book is pleasing, and 
should find favor with those who love rural nature, 
its art and literature. Mr. Davidson has made his 
selections with taste, and has managed to maintain 
in most cases a discernible degree of harmony be- 
tween plate and text. Among the writers repre- 
sented are Walton, Wordsworth, Hazlitt, Emerson, 
Taine, Thompson, Cowper, Burroughs, and Jef- 
feries. Oddly enough, Thoreau's name is missing. 
The engravings are acceptably done, and there is a 
good portrait of Mr. Foster. 

At the head of the list of old favorites in new form 
is the " Buckthorne " edition of Irving's " Tales of 
a Traveller " (Putnam). Little need be said in the 
way of general description of these two handsome 
volumes, which are gotten up in the style of the 
same publishers' familiar " Agapida," " Darro," and 
" VonTwiller " editions of " The Conquest of Gran- 
ada," " The Alhambra," and " The Knickerbocker 
History of New York," respectively, of past sea- 
sons. The most striking decorative feature of the 
present work is, as before, the tinted border fram- 
ing the text on each page, the present design show- 
ing a delicate combination of silver-gray and pale

salmon. Mr. George Wharton Edwards is respon- 
sible for most of the ornamentation, including the 
rather florid cover-design; while the twenty-five 
full-page illustrations are mainly from new draw- 
ings by Messrs. F. S. Church, Frederick Dielman, 
J. Wilson, Allan Barraud, and H. Sandham. The 
artists have acquitted themselves well, and the work 
ranks with the best of the season's publications. 

A very charming edition, in two trim 16mo vol- 
umes, of that sweet and genuine English classic, 
Gilbert White's " Natural History of Selborne," is 
issued by Messrs D. Appleton & Co., printed from 
the text and with the new letters of the Buckland 
edition. The volumes are liberally and tastefully 
illustrated by Mr. Clifton Johnson ; and Mr. John 
Burroughs has furnished an Introduction in which 
he draws a loving and sympathetic portrait of his 
author, and discusses the secret of the longevity 
and perennial charm of his work " one of the few 
books," he avers, " which I can return to and re-read 
every six or seven years." Let us add that the 
qualities which have kept White's ' Selborne " fresh 
and sweet while so many learned treatises on its 
theme have sunk to their kindred dust, are the 
dominant ones in Mr. Burroughs's own fragrant 
pages. 

A new two-volume edition of Mrs. Jane G. Aus- 
tin's popular historical novel, "Standish of Stan- 
dish," that fastidious book-buyers will find hard to 
resist is issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
Timeliness of theme and quiet elegance of make-up 
combine to make the work one of the most desir- 
able gift-books of the season. The pictorial feature 
is twenty full-page illustrations by Mr. Frank T. 
Merrill, whom we heartily congratulate on the 
really high artistic quality of his work. There are 
few plates in this series that are not gems in their 
class graceful and spirited in conception, and 
sound in execution. It is a pleasure to welcome 
such refined and finished productions from the pen- 
cil of a native illustrator. Of Mrs. Austin's popu- 
lar romance we need only say that it is at once pic- 
turesque and scholarly, presenting in the form most 
generally attractive a phase of our national life- 
story that is just now the subject of widespread and 
deserved, if somewhat belated, interest. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.'s new edition 
of Longfellow's " Hiawatha " is a model one for 
practical use, and luxurious enough withal to make 
it a suitable Holiday gift. The art feature is twenty- 
two full -page photographic plates from designs 
originally made by Mr. Frederic Remington for 
the elaborate edition of the poem issued by the 
same firm five seasons ago, the plates being now 
considerably reduced. For practical purposes, the 
present handier and more modest form is much the 
better. Mr. Remington's designs are, as usual, re- 
morselessly realistic too much so, we think, for 
their illustrative aim and poetical setting. Here, 
Mr. Remington could probably furnish cogent ar- 
guments contra ; but we wish, nevertheless, he had 
thought fit to idealize, or " Cooperize," his more 



uncompromisingly ugly " bucks " and " squaws " a 
little in the interests of sentiment. The volume 
contains a portrait of Mr. Longfellow, from an orig- 
inal of 1840, and there is an Introduction, together 
with ample notes. 

Very tasty and practical is Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.'s Christmas edition of Longfellow's 
"The Courtship of Miles Standish," with many 
illustrations, full-page and vignette, after the de- 
signs of Messrs. Boughton, Merrill, Reinhart, Shap- 
leigh, and other well-known delineators of Puritan 
life. Besides an Introduction sketching the incep- 
tion and growth of the poem, as indicated in Mr. 
Longfellow's journal and letters, there are copious 
historical notes, which, with the accompanying wood- 
cuts, will materially assist the reader's comprehen- 
sion and enjoyment of this graceful Puritan pasto- 
ral. Bright, open type, pliant, lightly glazed paper, 
and a modestly decorative cover of maroon and gilt, 
make up a tempting ensemble. 

A new and revised edition of Mr. Joel Chandler 
Harris's inimitable " Uncle Remus," with an added 
feature in the shape of a hundred and twelve vig- 
nettes from the whimsical pencil of Mr. A. B. Frost, 
together with a frontispiece showing the aged fab- 
ulist pouring his marvels into the ear of the little 
boy, is attractively issued by Messrs. D. Appleton 
& Co. Mr. Frost's conceptions of " Brer Rabbit," 
" Brer B'ar," etc., are indescribably funny, plainly 
the one element needed to round out " Uncle Re- 
mus " and make it " a joy forever." In addition to 
the fables, the book contains Songs and Sayings of 
" Uncle Remus," together with " Plantation Revels " 
and " A Story of the War." Mr. Harris furnishes 
an Introduction which will interest those inclined 
to view the stories from the f olk-lorist's standpoint. 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page's familiar tale of Old 
Virginia, "Unc' Edinburg," is now issued by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons in a neatly appointed small- 
folio volume, similar to their editions of the same 
author's "Marse Chan" and "Meh Lady." The 
illustrator is Mr. B. West Clinedinst, who shows a 
good appreciation of his author, and the due famil- 
iarity with " Old Dominion " types. Everyone who 
reads Mr. Page at all should read "Unc' Edin- 
burg," for it is decidedly one of the best things he 
has done and Mr. Page is easily chief in his 
chosen literary province. Somehow these romantic 
little stories of his, which we take to be at bottom 
reminiscent of a past social phase more than half 
regretted by the author, leave an impression that 
if the war wiped out a great moral wrong and na- 
tional stain, it also did away with a good deal that 
was beautiful and picturesque in our somewhat pro- 
saic and uniform civilization. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s tastefully ornate edi- 
tion of Goldsmith's " She Stoops to Conquer," uni- 
form with the firm's " The Rivals," The School for 
Scandal," etc., of former seasons, will doubtless find 
friends among seekers of pretty yet inexpensive 
gift-books. The illustrator this time is Mr. F. C. 
Gordon, and he has done fairly well, though his

drawings generally are hardly up to the require- 
ments of the text in the qualities of verve and hu- 
mor. Two or three of the plates are not unworthy 
of Mr. Abhey, while some of them are rather me- 
diocre. The book is showily bound in dark-green 
cloth with gold stamping, and the text is clearly 
printed on rather thick glazed paper, full gilt. 

A very inviting edition of Charles Reade's fine 
novel, "Christie Johnstone" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), 
is likely to prove one of the season's favorites. The 
story, it is needless to say, is one of Reade's best 
capital as a story, and vivid and life-like as a pic- 
ture of a piquant phase of Scotch life and manners. 
Walter Scott himself has scarcely done anything 
better in their way than one or two of the episodes 
Christie's famous tongue-duel, for instance, with 
ill-starred Beeny Listen. The plates in the volume 
are so good, for the most part, as to make the omis- 
sion of the artist's name rather surprising ; and, 
altogether, print, paper, binding, and press-work, 
combine to make up a material ensemble worthy of 
the story. 

Eugene Sue's ever-fascinating romance, " The 
"Wandering Jew," once more emerges in a new garb, 
this time in two generous 12uio volumes from the 
press of Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., whose neat 
and inexpensive editions of standard books we have 
often commended. The volumes contain eighteen 
full-page illustrations, including two frontispieces 
in photogravure. The original Chapman & Hall 
version, probably the best, has been reprinted from 
new plates ; and, altogether, the edition, like other 
similar ventures of this firm's, is all, and rather 
more, than might be expected for the price. 

Mr. F. Marion Crawford's graphic papers on 
" Constantinople," with twenty-eight illustrations by 
Mr. E. L. Weeks, are reprinted in tempting style 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The theme is 
a congenial one to Mr. Crawford's rather florid pen, 
and he makes the shifting panorama of the city of 
the Golden Horn pass vividly before us in its pris- 
matic contrasts and cosmopolitan variety. Mr. 
Weeks's drawings, notably a fine study of an Ar- 
menian and a view of Galata bridge, are satisfac- 
tory, and bear out the glowing descriptions of the 
text. Mr. Crawford inclines to take a very favor- 
able view of the Turk, that is, the real Turk, whom 
he styles " a fine fellow, belonging to the superior 
and dominant races of the world. . . . He is sober; he 
is clean ; and he is honest, even to his own disadvan- 
tage, being by no means a match for the wily Greeks 
and Armenians, who are perpetually fattening on 
his heart." The conception of the Turk as an injured 
innocent preyed on by Armenians is a novel, and, 
just now, a rather startling one. Perhaps Mr. 
Crawford would regard this " fine fellow's " recent 
performances as justifiable, if somewhat stern, re- 
prisals. 

Three new volumes in The Century Co.'s tiny 
" Thumb-Nail Series " are : "The Rivalries of Long 
and Short Codiac," by George Wharton Edwards ; 
A Madeira Party," by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell ; and 



"Notes of a Professional Exile, "by E. S. Nadal. Mr. 
Edwards once more finds his theme and types among 
the hardy fisher-folk of the islands off the Maine 
coast, a region pleasantly exploited in his " P'tit 
Matinic." Dr. Mitchell's book offers two heretofore 
unpublished sketches : the one from which the volume 
takes the title, and a bizarre story of the French 
Revolution entitled "A Little More Burgundy." 
The plot of the latter tale is ingenious enough. A 
family of suspects hide themselves from the fury of 
the Jacobins in a wine-celler, the entrance to which 
is finally closed against them. The cellar commu- 
nicates with the catacombs ; and here the fugitives 
lose their way and wander about for days, emerging 
opportunely just as the arch-terrorist, or arch-scape- 
goat, Robespierre, is overthrown and sent to " sneeze 
in the sack" (according to the odious slang of the 
day) by the Thermidorians. Dr. Mitchell makes 
the most of his striking situation. Mr. Nadal, who 
was for some time a secretary of legation at London, 
presents in his little book a sheaf of sketches of life 
and character as seen at an imaginary continental 
watering-place, together with some other interesting 
notes and memories. The papers are pleasantly 
written, crisp, chatty, and shrewd, brightened with 
a vein of unforced humor, and sprinkled with 
sketches of or comments on many people famous or 
notorious, from Gladstone and Matthew Arnold, 
down to that eminent Bostonian, Mr. John Sullivan. 
Each of the dainty trio of volumes is full gilt, bound 
in stamped leather, and furnished with a frontis- 
piece drawing and tinted title-page. 

The students of the Art School at Birmingham, 
England, have exercised their talents to good pur- 
pose in the drawings and decorations of an art edi- 
tion of Mr. S. Baring-Gould's " Book of Nursery 
Songs and Rhymes " (Lippincott). The text, which 
contains most of the old nursery favorites, is framed 
in freely decorated pages, each having a heavy bor- 
der of conventional flowers and leaves in black-and- 
white. The plates are quaint pre-Raphaelite rep- 
resentations of the familiar nursery characters, 
" Jack Homer," for example, being drawn by the 
artist as a severe young man of the " Bunthorne " 
type, who looks heartily ashamed of his frivolous 
Christmas-pie propensities. The editor's introduc- 
tion is a humorously-written but forcible defense of 
the " nonsense theory " of nursery rhymes, as op- 
posed to the archaeological theory so profoundly 
urged by certain laborious writers. The book will 
amuse and entertain all persons who have not out- 
grown the traditions and pleasures of their child- 
hood. 

Mr. E. A. Vizetelly's English version of M. Zola's 
"A Love Episode" (" Une Page d ' Amour "j is 
issued in a thick and rather cumbrous octavo volume 
by the Lippincott Co. The work is soberly mounted, 
and contains ninety-four passable wood-cuts after 
M. E. Thevenot's designs. The romance shows, 
perhaps, M. Zola at his best, or at any rate at his 
highest and cleanliest ; and it proves pretty conclu- 
sively that his realism can cut below the surface,

and is not, as commonly charged, confined to out- 
ward and visible things. The account of Helene 
Grandchamp's struggle with passion, her fall and 
retribution, is profoundly pathetic, the story, as 
Mr. Lang observed, of " a good and pure woman 
upon whom the fate of her family falls, with the 
result that she loves a kind of Dr. Brand Firmin, 
like the father of Philip in Thackeray's novel." 
In his preface, Mr. Vizetelly prudently observes 
that " whatever charges may be levelled against 
some of M. Zola's works, nobody can say that this 
tale tends to corrupt and debase ; for it teaches the 
wholesome lesson that dereliction of duty, whatever 
its attendant 'extenuating circumstances,' brings 
with it its own harrowing punishment." One won- 
ders what M. Zola himself might say of this emi- 
nently British appreciation of an art-work. Mr. 
Vizetelly's is the only authorized English version. 

A dainty, moderate -priced gift -book may be 
found in Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s La Belle 
Nivernaise, and Other Stories," by Alphonse Dau- 
det, a comely 16mo, with a cover of pale green 
with gilt side-stamp. Besides the opening story, 
there are five others : " Jarjaille's Visit to the Good 
God," " The Fig and the Sluggard," " My First 
Dress-Coat," " Father Balaguere's Christmas Feast," 
and " The New Teacher." The text is liberally 
sprinkled with slight, though piquant and clever, 
pen-sketches which are decidedly better than the 
rather insipid full-page plates. In " My First Dress- 
Coat," the author treats us to a pleasant bit of 
youthful autobiography. Of all M. Daudet's short 
stories, " La Belle Nivernaise " is, to our notion, the 
most charming; and, if one is to read it in En- 
glish, the present edition is preferable to any that 
we now recall. Mr. Huntington Smith's rendering 
is satisfactory, barring an occasional tendency to 
put American slang into the mouth of Pere Lou- 
veau which is, after all, excusable enough, in view 
of the difficulty of getting a foreign equivalent for 
the good skipper's queer argot. 

Lovers of droll pictures may find their account 
in the two large-quarto volumes entitled severally 
"Chip's Dogs" and " Chip's Old Woodcuts " (R. 
H. Kussell & Son), by the late Mr. F. P. Bellew 
("Chip"), who will be pleasantly remembered by 
readers of " Life." The first-named volume is es- 
pecially funny rather in Mr. A. B. Frost's quaint 
vein ; and ought to suffice to expel the " blues " from 
anyone whose bump of humor is not, as the Irish- 
man expressed it, "a dent." The books are neatly 
bound in strong boards, and printed on smooth 
plate paper. 

Dr. William Dodd's " Beauties of Shakespeare " 
is an excellent anthology, and Messrs. T. Y. Crow- 
ell & Co. have made a pretty handy-edition of it, 
in two trim 16mo volumes. Certain judicious ad- 
ditions have been made to the original illustrations, 
and the text has been carefully revised. The vol- 
umes are printed from new plates, and there are 
two frontispieces in photogravure a portrait of 
Shakespeare, and a Stratford view. 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

L 

The number of new Christmas books for children is 
so large this year that it seems as though the old ones 
must be crowded out by them. The imagination that 
goes to the making of such a collection might almost 
supply a modern school of fiction; yet here it is scat- 
tered through some half a hundred volumes, frittering 
away its usefulness in impractical and impossible ex- 
travagances. Brought to bear thus upon childhood, it 
may stimulate the heroes and geniuses who shall in the 
future do the world's great work; but it seems more 
probable that it may crush them. Nevertheless, there 
are a few books that compensate for the general medi- 
ocrity, which was perhaps necessary to produce the 
others; and no year can be called barren which brings 
to light a masterpiece like Mr. Kipling's "Second Jungle 
Book" (Century Co.). Nothing could be of more ab- 
sorbing interest to children; and yet so artistic a book 
should not be confined to them alone. When one en- 
counters work as original, as imaginative, as masterly 
as this, no words can convey an idea of the thing itself. 
Mr. Kipling takes all nature for his province; he seems 
as familiar with the flowers of the field as with the 
beasts of the jungle. And the truth of his statements 
is never doubted for an instant. His creatures are alive 
in every muscle, and they are not human beings mas- 
querading in hair and claws. They are beasts, with the 
instincts and desires of beasts, but with emotions enough 
like our own to make us shudder now and then. An 
imagination which can make such creatures live for us, 
which can give us a breathless interest in their suffer- 
ings and triumphs, seems beyond the human. From the 
superb description of the drought in the jungle, with 
which the book opens, to the last tale, in which the 
irreconcilable, eternal difference between man and beast 
is borne in upon us, the book is a series of magnificent 
pictures. It is never still, though, but the rush of its 
movement has a certain stately dignity which makes 
one respect the Law of the Jungle. Each story is in- 
troduced and ended with a little poem, and these rhyth- 
mical songs are the work of a true poet, one of the 
truest poets who is writing in English to-day. Cer- 
tainly no other could have conceived " Mowgli's Song 
against People," " Child's Song," and " The Song of the 
Little Hunter." They cling in the mind, like the great 
fight with Red Dog in the Place of Death where lived 
the " busy, furious Little People of the Rocks." There 
is a vivid directness about all these descriptions which 
brings them straight home. 

Aside from this, the most interesting work this year is 
done by Mr. Joel Chandler Harris, Mr. Theodore Roose- 
velt, Mr. Edmondo de Amicis, Mr. Howard Pyle, Mr. 
James Baldwin, Mr. A. J. Church, and Mrs. Catharine 
Yale. Mr. Harris's book is a sequel to "Little Mr. Thim- 
blefinger and his Queer Country," and it is called " Mr. 
Rabbit at Home " (Houghton). The illustrations, by Mr. 
Oliver Herford, are almost as charming as the stories 
themselves, and that is saying much. The talk between 
Buster John, Sweetest Susan, Drusilla, and Mr. Rabbit 
is delightful, never heavy, and always stimulating one's 
interest in the tale that follows. There is a sparkling 
gaiety about the book which few writers know how to 
attain, and it is worth any number of moral lectures. 
The imagination that evolved " Uncle Remus " is turned 
to good account in these brief stories, and they are as 
delightful as a keen wit, a light heart, and a whimsical 
fancy can make them Mr. Howard Pyle's style is some-

what more self-conscious, but it is good and honest 
nevertheless. " The Garden Behind the Moon " (Scrib- 
ner) is as fascinating as its title, and the drawings by 
the author are a potent factor in this result. There is 
a wise simplicity about the style which appeals to chil- 
dren of all ages. " You may smile at this story if you 
choose," he says at the end, " and call it all moonshine, 
but if you do not believe by this time that there is 
more in moonshine than the glimmer and the whiteness, 
why, I could not make you believe it if I were to write 
a hundred and twenty-seven great books instead of this 
short story." But Mr. Pyle's readers do not doubt it 
for a moment " More Fairy Tales from the Arabian 
Nights " ( Putnam ) is a sumptuous volume, well 
printed and bound,, and illustrated with J. D. Bat- 
ten's beautiful decorative drawings. The text is that 
of Galland, 1821, somewhat abridged and edited for 
the young by E. Dixon ; and it forms an excellent in- 
troduction to those immortal tales which have helped 
so long to keep the weary world young It was a haz- 
ardous experiment that Anna M. Richards tried in " A 
New Alice in the Old Wonderland " (Lippincott), and 
it is not at all strange that it is a failure. Those who 
love the original Alice will be glad to meet the familiar 
figures again, but they will be sorry, too, to find that 
they have somehow lost their old elusive charm. There 
is a good deal of cleverness in the book, but alas ! so 
much less than went into the making of its prototype. 
And the nonsense verses have no music in them Mrs. 
Yale's fairy-tales are of a different kind from any of 
these. " Nim and Cum, and the Wonder-Head Stories " 
(Way & Williams) is as light and delicate and fanciful 
as a bit of Dresden china. The simple pretty allegory 
of the cloud story at the beginning is of a kind to de- 
light imaginative children ; and the tales which follow 
it seem to be borne out of the common practical world, 
and yet to be of it. They have the realities of life in 
them, but they are so deftly touched as to appear to 
belong to the realm of fancy. It is an artistic hand 
that has builded them. 

The stories in " The Silver Fairy Book " (Putnam) 
are gathered from many sources. Sarah Bernhardt 
writes one, and a sadly theatrical one it is; Voltaire an- 
other, Hige'sippe Moreau a third, and others are drawn 
from the Spanish, German, and Servian. Naturally 
they are of different degrees of merit, but some of them 
are charming, delicately suggestive of large issues. The 
drawings by H. R. Millar are perhaps the best thing 
about the book, though, so genuinely original and artis- 
tic are they. In Mr. Millar's handling of black-and- 
white the influence of Vierge is agreeably evident. In 
" Chris and the Wonderful Lamp " (Century Co.) Al- 
bert Stearns has written an amusing story of a young 
American who comes into possession of Aladdin's lamp. 
The genie who appears unexpectedly proves himself 
thoroughly modern, and the services he performs for 
Chris include taking his place in school and on the ball- 
field. He is clever enough, however, to outwit the boy 
at many points, and the manifold difficulties of the sit- 
uation are described with much humor. The book is 

well illustrated by Reginald Birch and E. B. Bensell 

There is some humor too in " The Keeper of the Sala- 
mander's Order " (Roberts), by William Shattuck, but 
hardly enough to pay for making the acquaintance of 
the strange beasts and fishes and ogres that abound in its 
pages. It is a long and complicated story, and though 
it required some imagination to write it, it requires lit- 
tle to read it. The cuts are hopelessly inartistic. Mr. 



J. Selwin Tait has written in a bright and graceful way 
of the extraordinary adventures of " Wayne and his 
Friends" (J. Selwin Tait & Sons). The beginning of 
a mythical story makes the boy dream of the most un- 
usual deeds of prowess and daring. Ferocious beasts 
quail before this valiant knight, who passes among them 

unharmed because he is without fear It is delightful 

to find a real fairy-story like " The Elf-Errant " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), one that has the atmosphere of fairy-land, 
its daintiness, its flower -like grace. Miss O'Neill's 
style is as light as thistle-down, as exquisite as a hare- 
bell; and she has the poetic instinct which alone can 
make fairy-land the place of all others for children to 
roam in. The little book is printed on excellent paper 
and is admirably illustrated by W. E. F. Britten. It 
is a decided contrast to " The Brownies Through the 
Union " (Century Co.), in which Mr. Palmer Cox shows 
once again a certain facility in the making of amusing 
little figures and sadly prosaic verses. The first Brownie 
book was clever, but the fifth is merely wearisome. 
Mr. Cox's imagination was long ago exhausted, and he 
is trying to repeat a former success. It is a pity that 
these books have become so popular, for the verses con- 
tain few ideas and no rhythm. The set of Banbury 
Cross books (Macmillan), which comes in a green cloth 
case, will do children far more good, for they are written 
in excellent English and illustrated by artists. They are 
the familiar old stories, like " Jack the Giant-Killer," 
"Bluebeard," and the "Sleeping Beauty"; and the 
series is edited by Grace Rhys, and illustrated by R. 
Anning Bell and others. Mr. S. Baring-Gould's " Old 
English Fairy Tales " (Way & Williams) represents, 
we believe, the first attempt to gather and adapt to the 
reading of children a representative collection of the 
older English folk tales and traditionary stories. Of 
renderings and adaptations from foreign authors, such 
as the brothers Grimm, Andersen, Perault, the Countess 
D'Aulnoy, etc., there has been no lack; but the native 
springs have been strangely neglected. The volume 
differs from the recent kindred collections of Mr. Joseph 
Jacobs, in that the author has gone mainly to the ancient 
sources, while Mr. Jacobs's stories are largely of modern 
origin. We may add that Mr. Baring-Gould has suc- 
ceeded much better than his co-worker in talking down 
to the mental level of the little ones for whom his book 
is primarily written. Unless our memory deceives us 
on this point, it would take a very wise, child indeed to 
wrestle successfully with Mr. Jacobs's diction. The 
volume is a tasteful and durable piece of book-making; 
and the fanciful full-page drawings of Mr. F. D. Bed- 
ford make it the more attractive. 

Study some government reports of Indian life, through 
" the courtesy of the Librarian of the Smithsonian In- 
stitute " (an organization, by the way, that never ex- 
isted) , then thumb the already badly worn " standard 
works of Schoolcraft, Copway, and Catlin." When you 
have done so you will know the Indian, and his psychol- 
ogy will be an open book before you. Then sit down, 
and, with " S., C. and C." as your mine of crude mate- 
rial, make up some Indian stories for children. Secure 
an artist, badly infected with some recent fad ideas, to 
draw a series of astonishingly draped Indian fairies. 
All this done, combine the stories and pictures into a 
book for infliction on helpless childhood. In doing this 
you will repeat Miss Compton's labors in " Snow Bird 
and the Water Tiger, and Other American Indian 
Tales " (Dodd). She has produced a pretty book, but 
one which can have no reason for existence. " Indian "I

What Indian? Are Algonkin and Moki tales the same 
thing? Why introduce birch-bark canoes and tarantulas 
into the same bit of country? Does nature show us any 
such curious combinations? If Indian tales are good 
food for children, let us show the little readers that 
there are Indians and Indians. Any child who would 
enjoy Miss Compton's stories would still more enjoy 
Charles Godfrey Leland's " Algonquin Legends of New 
England " and George Bird Grinnell's " Pawnee Hero 
Tales " and " Blackfoot Lodge Tales " so beautifully 
and naturally told. The Indian legend does not need 
" writing down " to a child, as Miss Compton seems to 
think ; told just as it stands, it pleases him. The abil- 
ity to express the Indian story aright comes not through 
the reading of government reports ; it is absorbed by 
him or her who lives day after day with the red man. 
Leland's and Grinnell's stories live and breathe : Miss 
Compton's scarcely gasp. It is a pity that the lady, 
who has really a dainty and pretty style, should have 
undertaken this task. 

It is impossible to classify " Cuore, an Italian School- 
boy's Journal " (Crowell), by Edmondo de Amicis. It 
stands alone, with no competition in the same field. And 
it has about it a wonderful serenity : this in spite of 
the adventurous episodes, which are by no means tame. 
Its influence makes for gentleness and courage, sympa- 
thy and unselfishness, loyalty and patriotism. The true 
democracy breathes through these pages; boys of all 
classes are placed upon a stern equality, and the spirit 
of friendly helpfulness awakened. Their teacher is a 
fine type and vividly rendered. The style of the book 
would hardly be possible to a child, yet it is written 
with the simplicity of childhood, and an honest boyish- 
ness hangs about it. This new edition of Isabel F. Hap- 
good's translation is illustrated by Italian artists but 

indifferently well "The Child's Garden of Song" 

(McClurg) is also unclassifiable. It contains the words 
and music of thirty songs, which were selected and ar- 
ranged by William L. Tomlins, whose wide experience 
in the training of children's voices makes him an excel- 
lent judge. His reputation alone should sell the book, 
but it has another attraction in the pretty decorations 
by Ella Ricketts. 

If the world were always beautiful, and children 
always good, and life always smooth for the virtuous 
and rough for the wicked, then " Two Little Pilgrims' 
Progress" (Scribner) would be a true story. But as 
things are arranged in this ungrateful old world, it 
would be hard to find the counterpart of Mrs. Burnett's 
tale. Although her two pilgrims are but twelve years 
old and travel alone to the World's Fair, they meet no 
difficulties whatever. They have no fear, they never 
get lost or confused, and find only courtesy and kind- 
ness. Indeed, they encounter a man who is so fascinated 
that he takes them about and adopts them without fur- 
ther parley. But that is not surprising, as two such 
proper children are not found twice in a lifetime. They 
are mentally proper, too, and they have exactly the 
right emotions at the right times. Their ideas assuredly 
are rather old for their years, and they express them in 
a manner that would be stilted at forty; but neverthe- 
less sentimental mammas will probably gloat over these 
ancient children, and their offspring will feel guilty be- 
cause they find them dull. The fact that the " City 
Beautiful " appears in the book is its only charm. 

The group of instructive books is small this year, but 
it is worth all the great pile of stories of adventure put 
together, and there are many boys who will find it more 



entertaining. It contains, moreover, the book of the 
year, aside from Mr. Kipling's, which is an exception to 
every rule, the one volume which should be in the hands 
of every young American. The " Hero Tales from 
American History " (The Century Co.) are written by 
Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt, and they 
are as exciting as one could desire. The preface de- 
clares that the object of the book is " to tell in simple 
fashion the story of some Americans who showed that 
they knew how to live and how to die; who proved their 
truth by their endeavor, and who joined to the stern 
and manly qualities which are essential to the well- 
being of a masterful race the virtues of gentleness, of 
patriotism, and of lofty adherence to an ideal." This 
the authors have done with a direct simplicity which 
brings the heroic deeds home to the reader with thrill- 
ing effect. The style is admirable, a thing that unfor- 
tunately cannot be often said of books for the young; 
and any boy who can read these tales without a quicken- 
ing of the pulses and an enrichment of character must 
be made of stone. 

In " Turning Points in Successful Careers " (Crowell) 
the Rev. William M. Thayer attempts to select the sin- 
gle moment in a man's life which has decided its direc- 
tion. This is often an impossible task, so many ele- 
ments usually enter into a man's choice of occupation. 
In some cases, therefore, Mr. Thayer has exaggerated 
the importance of certain decisions; and in others he 
has even perverted mistakes. This is true of the story 
of Claflin the merchant, whose abandonment of Greek 
and Latin for business is certainly open to question from 
the point of view of wisdom. Neither was it a deci- 
sion which changed the current of his life, set inevita- 
bly in one direction. Still, in spite of a certain density 
of insight, the book gives useful accounts of the lives 
of eminent men. Much the same service is performed 
for women in Mrs. Sarah Knowles Bolton's " Famous 
Leaders among Women " (Crowell) . The selections 
are rather eccentric, but the biographies are written 
with vivacity and interlarded with stories. Mrs. Bol- 
ton always tries to implant a moral, but her style is a 
little old for young readers and a little young for older 
ones. Two books by the Rev. A. J. Church will be 
welcomed by all boys and girls who are familiar with 
his work. One of them, " Roman Life in the Days of 
Cicero " (Macmillan), contains a series of sketches the 
material for which is drawn largely from Cicero's let- 
ters and speeches. They describe many things about 
the life of that time which the school histories always 
omit, things that lend reality and novelty and color to 
dry facts. Read in connection with the study of Ro- 
man history, it will not only be useful but eminently 
entertaining. Even more interesting perhaps are the 
" Stories from Virgil " (Macmillan), by the same au- 
thor. The style in which they are told is capital, with 
enough quaintness to suggest the charm of the original 
and not too much to make it easy to read. Books of 
this kind are invaluable in familiarizing children with 
the old stories and giving them the desire in later life 
to read the great poets who narrate them. Mr. James 
Baldwin has worked in a similar direction in his stories 
of "Siegfried" and of the "Golden Age," and the 
familiar acquaintance with mythology and legend which 
is thus given to a child will be delightful to him all his 
life. If he misses this knowledge in childhood, then 
so easily imparted, he can never quite make up for the 
loss of it afterwards. In this year's volume Mr. Bald- 
win has developed an original idea, and novelty is a

quality unknown to most of the current books for the 
young. " The Horse Fair " (Century Co.) is held in 
the land of Morgan the fay, to which an American boy 
who loves horses is conducted by Cheiron. It was a 
horse show such as no other mortal has been permitted 
to look upon. The famous chargers of all ages of the 
world were gathered there, and the programme of events 
is enough to set the slowest blood to racing. The entries 
were numerous and included steeds as far separated in 
time and quality as Pegasus, Aurora's high-jumpers, 
Bucephalus, Bayard, Rozinante, Ichabod Crane's Gun- 
powder, and the horses upon which the famous generals 
of the world rode to victory. The description of the 
fair is written with much skill, and awakens the inter- 
est of old and young. 

The boys have much the best of it this year in the 
matter of books. The stories of adventure by sea and 
land are far more numerous than any others, and no 
boy with longings to become a pirate or a highwayman 
need go unencouraged. In these romances the devices 
of such heroes in many ages and widely different coun- 
tries are described for his benefit, and he may choose 
whatever method of procedure pleases him best. Of 
course there are always nice little boys in these tales, 
who are captured, through no indiscretion of their own, 
by naughty marauders. But they suffer many hard- 
ships in their valiant efforts to avenge the wronged and 
punish the wicked ; and though they are always trium- 
phant in the end, their lot is not nearly so attractive as 
that of the pirate bold, who is ruler of men and master 
of the seas. After all, though, it is no unworthy object 
to cultivate the spirit of daring in the American youth. 
He is often too easily content with the commonplace 
realities of daily life, and it is well to stimulate his 
imagination and give him a glimpse of active life out- 
side of schools and offices. The best book of this kind 
among those just issued is " Jack Ballister's Fortunes," 
written and illustrated by Howard Pyle (Century Co.). 
This narrates the history of an English youth of good 
family who was kidnapped in 1719, and taken to the 
colony of Virginia, where he was sold as a servant. 
Dissatisfied with his position, he makes his escape, only 
to fall into the hands of the famous " Blackboard," 
whose piratical raids along the coast were a terror to 
ship-owners. The story of his life with these seamen, 
his rescue of a beautiful damsel, and his final return to 
home and fortune, is told so well as to be full of intense 
interest. The fight especially is capital, and the entire 
book is helped much by Mr. Pyle's drawings, which are 
delightful. Mr. G. A. Henty publishes his customary 
three books, and each one has the semi-historical foun- 
dation which he affects. " Through Russian Snows " 
(Scribner) is a story of Napoleon's retreat from Mos- 
cow ; A Knight of the White Cross " (Scribner) has 
the siege of Rhodes for its centre; and "The Tiger of 
Mysore" (Scribner) deals with the war with Tippoo 
Saib. To any right-minded boy these subjects are cer- 
tainly alluring, and Mr. Henty's skill in dealing with 
them is remarkable when one considers the rate of pro- 
duction. He has a fertile invention, a good direct 
style, and a knowledge of the kind of exciting incident 
that appeals to boys. With them these things can 
carry him far, even without genius. There is a pic- 
turesqueness, too, in the subjects he selects which gives 
the books an impetus. The fires and snows lend inter- 
ast to the retreat from Moscow, the battle for his faith 
egainst the terrible but fascinating barbarian to the 
white Knights of St. John, and the terrors of Indian 



beasts and jungles and revolts to the war with Tippoo 
Saib. Through each of these Mr. Henty interests his 
readers in the fortunes of some particular hero, often a 
private in the ranks. Not so skilful are the authors of 
"Through Forest and Plain" (Roberts), Ashmore Rus- 
san and Frederick Boyle. But they have woven an un- 
usual tale about the journey of a collector and two boys 
in search of a rare orchid. Costa Rica is the scene of 
their adventures, and much information about tropical 
plants and flowers is intertwined with the exciting epi- 
sodes. It is more concise than " The Wizard King " 
(Lippincott) , in which Mr. David Ker has told a story 
of the last Moslem invasion of Europe. The title is the 
name applied to Sobieski by the Khan of Crim-Tartary ; 
and it would be impossible to chronicle here the hair- 
breadth escapes, the blood-curdling dangers, the inex- 
haustible gore which fill these closely-printed pages. 
They rather obscure the nobility of the great Pole's 
character. In " Chilhowee Boys in War Time " (Crow- 
ell) Sarah E. Morrison brings us back to our own coun- 
try and gives us some account of the War of 1812. The 
book is stilted, though, and contains much indifferent 
dialect. Its English, even when it is meant to be pure, 
is of inferior quality, and entirely unworthy the perusal 
of impressionable children. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons have brought out a new edition of Captain Mar- 
ryat's " Mr. Midshipman Easy." It is well printed in 
one large volume and contains many illustrations by R. 
F. Zogbaum. These are so well drawn as to be a de- 
cided help to the text, and boys will find them an effec- 
tive invitation to a closer acquaintance with this fam- 
ous hero. There are two books this year by Mr. Kirk 
Munroe, whose name is familiar to the young. One, 
" Snow-Shoes and Sledges " (Harper), is a sequel to 
" The Fur-Seal's Tooth," and it carries the same char- 
acters through a series of dangers in Alaska. The 
boys, in whom one becomes interested, pass through 
them safely and succeed in outwitting their enemies. 
" At War with Pontiac, or the Totem of the Bear " 
(Scribner), by the same author, deals with the red- 
skins and has a plot that is even more thrilling than the 
last. It contains, too, a fascinating Indian maiden, who 
makes herself very attractive to the stalwart American 
hero. The story is well written, Mr. Munroe being one 
of the successful makers of such books. Oliver Optic 
publishes another volume in his " All-over-the- world " 
series, this one being entitled " Half Round the World, 
or Among the Uncivilized " (Lee & Shepard). Ran- 
goon, Singapore, and Java are a few of the places vis- 
ited by the floating colony in this volume, and the op- 
portunities for novel situations are therefore rich. To 
those of us who read Oliver Optic as children he will 
always have a warm place in the memory. 

Napoleon has always been a heroic figure to the 
young, and they will welcome with enthusiasm a book 
which deals as happily with him as the one which 
Elbridge S. Brooks has just written. " A Boy of the 
First Empire " (Century Co.) has for its hero a little 
fellow who discloses to Napoleon a plot against his 
life. The boy's hearty sincerity commends him to the 
Emperor, who makes him a page in his household. His 
intimate personal service to the great man tests his 
strength of character repeatedly, but his courage and 
loyalty prove equal to the test. The story shows one 
the brilliancy of life at court, and later the excitement 
of the battlefield, and its hero is sent on many a deli- 
cate and dangerous mission. The style is good and the 
interest never flags. The characters too are something

better than lay figures, and Mr. H. A. Ogden's illustra- 
tions are moderately good. A different war is the sub- 
ject of "Jack Alden" (Crowell), by Mr. Warren Lee 
Goss. He takes one through the Virginia compaigns 
of thirty years ago; and in his preface he says that 
there is " not a description of a battle or scene of the 
war in this story that is not true to history or to real 
army life." This is a valuable recommendation, espe- 
cially as the real life of a soldier was too exciting to 
need any imaginative embellishment. The hardships 
the men had to endure are not neglected, and we are 
even taken with the hero to Libby Prison and escape 
with him. The materials are well handled and make 
a story which should awaken the dormant patriotism of 

everyone who reads it War is the subject, too, of 

Mr. Edward King's Under the Red Flag" (Henry T. 
Coates & Co.) ; but in this case it is the most terrible 
kind of war, that of anarchy and destruction. The hor- 
rors of the Paris Commune in 1871 form the field for 
the development of this plot, and three American boys 
who are caught in the whirlpool have their fill of adven- 
ture. The few illustrations are much worse than none. 
The remaining books of adventure deal with other 
battles than those of war. Mr. Herbert D. Ward has 
selected the Arctic regions for the scene of his conflict, 
which is but little more imaginative than many of these 
other tales. It is an o'ertrue tale of " A Dash to the 
Pole " (Lovell, Coryell & Co.), and the journey is made 
in an air-ship recently invented, but destined unfortu- 
nately for destruction. It served its purpose, how- 
ever, in carrying an adventurous party of men and boys 
to the North Pole and back again, and then through a 
sad mistake it escaped and sailed off into space. The 
narrative is told with much cleverness, even to the re- 
turn and the enforced concealment of the momentous 
discovery. Mr. George Manville Fenn takes smug- 
gling for his material, and in " Cormorant Crag " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.) relates the history of two boys who be- 
came involved in its meshes. The book is rather pro- 
lix, but as the story is told mainly in dialogue, a child's 
interest will not easily flag, especially as the boys are 
engaged in probing fascinating mysteries and making 
-exciting discoveries. Even more startling are the ad- 
ventures recorded in " The Desert Ship," by Mr. John 
Bloundelle-Burton (Warne). This narrates the search 
for an old Spanish galleon, wrecked long years ago in 
the great American desert, when it was still a sea. The 
success of the expedition has something weird and un- 
canny about it that is not quite extinguished by the too 
practical description of the ship's treasure. The story 
has all the elements of romance, and were it only more 
compact would be very successful. " The Chain of 
Gold, or In Crannied Rocks " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is 
another variation, by Mr. Standish O'Grady, in the pos- 
.sibilities of adventure. The " wild west coast of Ire- 
land " is his selection, and it surprises us to find that a 
new series of incidents can be concocted out of old ma- 
teriaj. The style, however, is decidedly dry. Mr. 
Louis Pendleton carries one south to the great Georgia 
swamp in his story. " In the Okefenokee " (Roberts) 
brings in the Rebellion again, but does not make it both 
centre and circumference. The illustrations, fortu- 
nately, are not numerous. " Boris, the Bear-Hunter " 
(T. Nelson & Sons), by Mr. Fred. Whishaw, takes one 
to Russia in the time of Peter the Great. " Hugh Mel- 
ville's Quest" (Lippincott), by Mr. F. M. Holmes, goes 
even further back, to the days of the Armada. Though 
in "The Mammoth Hunters" (Lothrop) Mr. Willis 



Boyd Allen returns to the present time, he describes a 
curious hunt for the bones of prehistoric animals in far- 
away Alaska. The Indian race plays an important part 
in "The Young Ranchers, or Fighting the Sioux" 
(Henry T. Coates & Co.), by Edward S. Ellis; and also 
in " Roger the Ranger " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), a story 
of border life in which Eli/a F. Pollard touches upon 
the conquest of French Canada by the British. The 
figures of Montcalm and Wolfe are conspicuous in this 
tale, a fact that will recommend it to all lovers of that 
picturesque period Canada is also the subject of "My 
Strange Rescue, and Other Stories " (Thomas Nelson 
& Sons), by Mr. F. Macdonald Oxley; but it is the Can- 
ada of the present time and of Mr. Oxley's lively im- 
agination. 

One of the most useful of this year's books is the 
" Popular History of Animals, for Young People " (Lip- 
pincott), by Henry Scherren. Its object is " to make or 
quicken interest in the observation of the habits of the 
lower animals " and in the " study of their relations to 
us and to each other." The volume contains many illus- 
trations, some of them colored, which assist in making 
it a valuable book of reference for the young, and one 
which older readers should by no means disdain. Like 
the last-named book, " Country Pastimes for Boys " 
(Longmans), by P. Anderson Graham, will give the mod- 
ern youth some new resources. It is avowedly written 
rather for the solitary boy than for those who are sur- 
rounded by companions, and it contains many hints 
which he will find it pleasant to follow up. There is 
much about birds'-nesting, an occupation which one does 
not like to see encouraged, and more about the train- 
ing of pets, feathered and otherwise. Another clever 
book is "The Three Apprentices of Moon Street" 
(Crowell), translated from the French of Georges Mon- 
torguiel. The cuts, by Louis Le Reverend and Paul 
Steck, are capital, and the tale is sprightly, happy-go- 
lucky, gaily written. One of the boys falls in with a 
travelling show, and acts the part of a wild untutored 
savage in it. It is amusing and of very light weight. 
Mr. J. T. Trowbridge always winds up his books with 
wholesome morals, and in " The Lottery Ticket " (Lee 
& Shepard) be relates the story of a boy who goes to 
the city to earn his fortune, falls into bad company, and 
becomes involved, unwittingly, in a dishonest transac- 
tion. His troubles, severe as they are, are finally over- 
come, but the warning is emphatic. Mr. Maurice 
Thompson does not overburden his romance with ethics, 
but " The Ocala Boy " (Lothrop) is wholesome enough, 
nevertheless. Two Northern boys who are spending the 
winter in Florida are the centre of interest, and the au- 
thor contrives to give the narrative a certain charm of 
mystery. It is simple, though, and well-written. A new 
edition of " Half a Dozen Boys," by Anna Chapin Ray, 
is published by Messrs. Crowell & Co. It is a pleasant 
story of harmless mischief, and the boys are very much 
alive, which accounts for the republicatiou after five 
years. A little book called " The Nimble Dollar, with 
Other Stories" (Houghton) is the work of an artist. 
The little tale called " The Reward of Heroes " would 
alone prove the author, Mr. Charles Miner Thompson, 
worthy of that title. There is a good deal of realism 
in the stories, which does not mean that they have no 
touches of romance. They are lively tales, which will 
do much more good than the sentimentalities that are 
too often offered. " The Impostor," by Mr. Charles 
Remington Talbot (Lothrop), is a college story, in which 
athletics form the most conspicuous feature.

LITERARY NOTES. 

An important art work, "Annals of Westminster 
Abbey," with nearly two hundred illustrations, will be 
issued at once by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. publish an exquisite 
little volume of Mr. T. B. Aldrich's " Later Lyrics," 
selected from his books of the last few years. 

The first prize in the Hull House competition for 
" people's songs " has been awarded to Miss Mary A. 
Lathbury, and the second to Mr. M. S. Paden. 

John Ormsby, the translator of " Don Quixote," a 
trustworthy scholar and an enthusiastic student of Span- 
ish literature, died October 30, at the age of sixty-six. 

The first volume of " The Reader's Shakespeare," an 
abridged edition edited by Mr. D. C. Bell of London, 
is about ready for issue by Messrs. Funk & Wagnalls. 

The new " Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia," the suc- 
cessor to the old " Appleton," published by the same 
firm, and edited by President C. K. Adams, is just com- 
pleted by the issue of the eighth volume. 

Mr. Percival Lowell's "Atlantic" papers on the 
planet Mars, based upon his interesting observations at 
Flagstaff, Arizona, will be published in an illustrated 
volume by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., this month. 

The excellent edition of Dumas' Romances in En- 
glish, published by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., will be 
continued by six new volumes, to appear immediately, 
some of the contents being now translated for the 
first time. 

Mr. Theodore Roosevelt's "New York" (Longmans), 
in the series of " Historic Towns," published some years 
ago, is now reissued, and is made to include a postscript 
on the events of the past five years, of which the author 
is so well qualified to write. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are to be the American 
publishers of the new edition of Haydn's " Dictionary 
of Dates," edited by Mr. Benjamin Vincent. The work 
will contain 1,250 pages, 1,200 articles, and 140,000 
" separate entries of dates and facts." 

Octavius Brooks Frothingham died in Boston on the 
twenty-seventh of November, at the age of seventy- 
three. For nearly half a century he has occupied a 
prominent position in the Unitarian church, and was 
well known as a writer upon religious and literary sub- 
jects. 

Really good editions of " Robinson Crusoe " and 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin " for fifty cents each seem an 
almost incredible achievement in bookmaking, yet this 
is what is promised by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. in the December issues of the excellent " Riverside 
Literature Series." 

Mr. George Saintsbury's new volume of essays on 
"Nineteenth Century Literature" will be published 
immediately by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. Mr. Saints- 
bury has just been nominated as Professor Masson's 
successor in the chair of English Literature at the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh. 

The plates of General Grant's " Memoirs " have come 
into possession of the Century Co., and the work is re- 
issued in a handsome two-volume edition, with new por- 
traits, maps, notes, and index. The edition is nearly 
uniform with the Century "Life of Lincoln," and is 
well worthy to stand beside it. 

A new edition of the " Lyra Elcgantiarum " of Mr. 
Frederick Locker-Lampson, which had been carefully 



revised by him before his death, is soon to appear from 
the press of Messrs. Ward, Lock & Bowden. The same 
firm has just issued the twelfth volume of their neat 
edition of the novels of Henry Kingsley, completing that 
very desirable series. 

A new work on " Plant Breeding," by Professor Bai- 
ley, which will undertake to discuss the underlying rea- 
sons, philosophy, and practice of the production of the 
new varieties of the gardener and the farmer, will soon 
be issued by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. It is expected 
that the book will be a contribution to the knowledge 
of organic evolution, as well as to the betterment of 
garden-craft. 

" Othello " is the latest addition to the " Temple " 
Shakespeare. If imitation be the sincerest form of flat- 
tery, Messrs. Macmillan & Co. must think well of the 
form of this work, for they have taken it as a model in 
their twenty-three-volume reissue of Tennyson, now in 
course of publication, and in " The Modern Reader's 
Bible," of which The Proverbs," edited by Mr. R. G. 
Moulton, is the first volume to appear. 

The new "Cyclopedia of Architecture in Italy, 
Greece, and the Levant," to be issued by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons in a style uniform with their 
" Cyclopaedia of Painters and Painting " and " Cyclo- 
paedia of Music and Musicians," will appeal to the lover 
of beautiful books not less than to the special student 
of art. The volume will be a quarto, with twelve full- 
page plates and over 250 text illustrations. 

Baron John Byrne Leicester Warren de Tabley, who 
died on the 24th of November, had reached the age of 
sixty years. It is only of late that he has become gen- 
erally known among the English poets, but the two 
volumes of his verse recently published have given him 
a wide reputation. Among the English poets who have 
survived Tennyson, he must be reckoned as one of the 
ten or twelve who have stood next to Mr. Swinburne 
and Mr. Morris. 

An afternoon of authors' readings was given at one 
of the Chicago theatres on the 26th of November, for 
the purpose of doing honor to the memory of Eugene 
Field, and of raising a sum of money for the support 
of the poet's family. Among those who participated 
were Mr. Henry B. Fuller, Mr. John V. Cheney, Miss 
Harriet Monroe, Mrs. Lindon Bates, and Mrs. M. H. 
Catherwood. A considerable sum was realized from 
the sale of tickets. 

The death of the Rev. Samuel F. Smith, on the six- 
teenth of November, removed from our living writer* 
one whose name, as the author of " America," was a 
household word. He was born in 1808, educated at 
Harvard, and became successively a clergyman, a pro- 
fessor, and an editor. He was remarkable as a linguist, 
while as a writer he was prolific, both in prose and verse. 
His collected poems have recently been published, and 
will be reviewed in an early issue of THE DIAL. 

Alexandre Dumas, the son of Alexander the Great, 
died on the twenty - seventh of November. He was 
almost the sole survivor of the great mid-century period 
of French letters, and his " Dame aux Camellias," at 
least, had gone many times round the world in its three- 
fold form of novel, play, and opera. He was one of the 
pioneer problem-dramatists, and his rank is somewhere 
near that of Augier and M. Sardou. Many of his plays 
are familiar to English and American theatre-goers. 

Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire died on the 24th of Novem- 
ber, at the advanced age of ninety. He was Minister

of Finance under Charles X., and assistant to Cousin in 
the Ministry of Public Instruction. Later, he occupied 
the Chair of Latin and Greek in the Ecole Polytech- 
nique. He declined to sanction the coup d'etat, and 
kept out of politics until his election to the Legislature 
just before the war of 1870. During the Presidency of 
Thiers, he acted as his secretary, and retired with his 
chief in 1873. In 1880, he was Minister of Foreign 
Affairs in the Freycinet Cabinet. His work as a scholar 
has given him a high place in the .history of French 
thought, and he is best known by his translation of Aris- 
totle, more than anything else the work of his lifetime. 
He wrote treatises on many Oriental subjects, and only 
two years ago began a three-volume biography of Cousin. 
He was one of the few men living in recent years who 
had seen and known the first Napoleon.

The Opinions of those who Speak not only from Rare Judgment but from Wide Experience 

and Knowledge: 

"As anticipated, the feature of the book is its extreme frankness, the style in which Mr. Sherman has expressed himself 
showing the statesman rather than the professional author." The Inter Ocean (Chicago). 

" Rich in ripe conclusions, full of interest as a personal narrative, instructive as a political record, and complete as a 
financial history of the country, the work adds to recent books of American history one of general interest and of value to 
students of politics and finance." The Pioneer Press (St. Paul). 

No book of modern times has received more unstinted praise from the entire press of the country.

A. C. McClurg & Co.'s Seasonable Books. 



MRS. LATIMER'S HISTORIES OF THE 
NINETEENTH CENTURY. 

The popularity of these histories and the confidence of the 
public in them are due to the fact that they contain just 
that recent history that is so hard to find anywhere in con- 
densed form. Following the three histories that have ap- 
peared during the past three years, Mrs. Latimer has added 
a fourth, in which she gives in her attractive and trust- 
worthy way the full story of European exploration, discov- 
ery, conquest, and adventure in Africa. The new volume 
is entitled : 

EUROPE IN AFRICA IN THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY. 

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER, author of "France 
in the Nineteenth Century," etc. Beautifully illustrated 
with twenty-three full-page half-tone Portraits. 8vo, 456 
pages, $2.50. 

It comes filled with fascinating historical gossip on matters, 
some of which are so recent that they seem almost like cur- 
rent news. 

The New York Independent, in speaking of Mrs. Latimer's histories, 
says : "In her the qualities which lead to just comparisons seem to be 
largely developed. She possesses in an eminent degree the power of 
calling up the past and setting it side by side with the present." 

The Chicago Inter Ocean says : " The great world outside is now to 
hear a great deal more of Africa than ever before, and such a book is 
timely and abounding in valuable facts." 

The Previous Histories by Mrs. Latimer are : 

FRANCE IN THE 19TH CENTURY Price, $2 50 

RUSSIA AND TURKEY IN THE 19TH CENTURY . " 2 50 
ENGLAND IN THE 19TH CENTURY . " 2 50

LINCOLN, 1846-1865. 

By WARD HILL LAMON. Edited by DOROTHY LAMON. With 
two Portraits and fac simile Letters. 12mo, 236 pages, 
$1.50. 

" It is all of interest and much of it novelty. It makes more real the 
real Lincoln." New York Independent. 



THE BOOK-HUNTER IN LONDON. 

Historical and Personal Studies of Book Collectors and Book 
Collecting. By WILLIAM ROBERTS, author of ' ' The Earlier 
History of English Bookselling," "Printers' Marks," etc. 
Copiously illustrated by Portraits of Eminent Collectors, by 
Sketches of Eminent Booksellers and their Shops, Notable 
Characters, and by/ac simile specimens of Printing, Bind- 
ing, etc. Large 8vo, $5.00 net. 

Large -Paper Edition, limited to 25 copies for America, 
$13.50 net. 

Mr. W. Roberts, whose works on book subjects are well- 
known, has in this volume presented a most entertaining his- 
tory of book-hunting in old times and in our own day. 

" The volume is in beautiful, clear print, is handsomely bound and 
aptly and artistically illustrated. But it is the well-written text which 
will most profoundly interest all book lovers and book collectors." 
Chicago Inter Ocean. 

NUMBER 49 TINKHAM STREET. 

By C. EMMA CHENEY, author of " Young Folks' History of 

the Civil War," etc. 12mo, $1.00.

rector of the Apollo Club of Chicago and of the Children's 
Choruses of the World's Fair. With beautiful colored de- 
signs by ELLA RICKETTS. Quarto, $2.00. 
" The songs are all such as jingle with the innocent fancy of child- 
hood, and one can picture the little ones crowding around their mother 
or elder sister as she sits at the piano and plays the accompaniment for 
their fresh, young voices." Commercial Advertiser, New York. 

A CHILD OF TUSCANY. 

By MARGUERITE BOUVET, author of "Sweet William," " My 
Lady," etc. Illustrated by WILL PHILLIP HOOPER. Small 
4to, 207 pages, $1.50. 

The Chicago Interior says of this book : '" A Child of Tuscany ' is. 
likely to have a vogue of no meagre proportions, but if it had Mrs. 
Frances H. Burnett's name signed to it 'twould sell by the tens of thou- 
sands and people would admiringly say how fine, how characteristic it 
is, how immeasurably better than 'Two Little Pilgrims' which, 
it is."

" An understanding of the grandeur of the sex-idea, and the immense 
beauty of its manifestations, is necessary to the understanding of 
human love, and is the immediate duty of our day. . . . and it is in 
the hope of helping to place in an orderly, harmonious and worthy posi- 
tion the most important fact of our existence that this little book is 
offered to the public."

In the Eighteenth Century. Translated by KASIMIR DZIE- 

KONSKA. With Portrait and other Illustrations. Kirao, gilt 

top, deckel edges, $1.25.

Polish patriotism and womanly devotion to country, which are inspiring 
and romantic in the extreme." Boston Journal. 



BEATRICE, OF BAYOU TECHE. 

By ALICE ILGENFRITZ JONES. 12mo, 386 pages, $1.25. 

" It is more than ordinarily well written, full of fanciful turns of 
phrase, and short, charming pen pastels, and would be agreeable read- 
ing even were the story a less pulse-quickening one." Commercial 
Advertiser, New York.

" Let DIARIES be Brought into Use" 

SAID THE WISE LORD BACON 300 YEARS AGO. 

The regular systematic use of a Diary economizes time, 
teaches method, and in the use of its Cash Account saves

An Account of Palmyra and Zenobia. 

With Travels and Adventures in Bashan and the Desert. By Dr. WILLIAM WRIGHT, author of " The Empire 
of the Hittites," " The Brontes in Ireland," etc. With 32 full-page engravings and 80 other illustrations. 
8vo, cloth extra, gilt top, $2.50. 

"This is a handsomely printed, well illustrated volume of 394 pages, reciting the explorations and adventures of nine 
years in this historic land. Its graphic, concise descriptions of famous places now in ruins, and its clear pen-pictures of the 
people that live and wander over these lands, are hoth entertaining and profitable reading." The Chicago Inter Ocean (Sep- 
tember 1-t, 1895). 

" Palmyra is chiefly known for its ruins and its traditions of Zenobia's illustrious reign. To both of these Dr. Wright 
does more justice than is commonly expected from travellers' tales. He has occupied himself with original research and the 
study of inscriptions, so that his narrative has a very different style from that of the vapid second-hand and tenth-rate liter- 
ature of the majority of unprofessional travellers. Much entertainment as well as much information may be found in this 
modest volume. New York Times (September 15, 1895).

bright, enjoyable book, and no boy into whose hands it falls will be will- 
ing to lay it aside till he has finished the last chapter." The Literary 
World. 

" The hero of J. Macdonald Oxley's new book is a boy of fifteen. . . . 
The interest never flags, and the young reader will be the better for his 
companionship with a brave and manly boy like Rae Finlayson. " The 
Evening Pott.

is a good story in its way."' The Congregationalist.

GRAND WINTER CRUISES 

BY THE MAGNIFICENT 

TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS 

OF THE 

, HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE. 

FOR several years past the Hamburg- American Line has arranged cruises at certain seasons, 
placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces, and affording them all 
the comforts and luxuries of modern life. These cruises have become so popular with the 
American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service. 

THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin -Screw Express Steamer FURST BISMARCK, 
Captain Albers, sailing from New York January 28, 1896, to MADEIRA, the MED- 
ITERRANEAN, and the ORIENT. 

Touching at Madeira, Gibraltar, Algiers, Genoa, Villefranche (Nice), Tunis, Alexandria (Cairo 
and Pyramids), Jaffa (Jerusalem), Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Malta, Messina, Palermo, Naples, 
Genoa, and return to New York. 

The cruise from New York to the Orient and return to New York will occupy about ten weeks. Pas- 
sengers desiring to prolong their stay in Europe before returning to America may leave the excursion 
upon touching at Genoa the second time and take any one of the Hamburg-American Line's Express 
Steamers from Hamburg, Southampton, or Cherbourg, to New York, up to August 1, 1896. 

Ever since the childhood of the human race the Mediterranean coasts have played the most important 
part in the history of advancing civilization. Greece has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and 
poetry, Home has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft, Egypt has filled our 
souls with thrills of awe and wonderment, the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig- 
ious fervor. All along the blue Mediterranean Sea we find the indelible imprints of man's past, the glo- 
rious monuments of antiquity. The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes, not in artistic 
reproduction, but in all its realistic grandeur and glory. The memories of such a trip, the sights of the 
scenery of the most remarkable events of man's history, will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every 
beholder. _ 

THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin -Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA, Cap- 
tain Vogelgesang, sailing from New York January 25, 1896, to the WEST INDIES 
and the SPANISH MAIN. 

The Itinerary will be: From New York and Old Point Comfort to Port au Prince (Hayti), May- 
aguez (Porto Rico), St. Thomas, St. Kitts, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, 
Trinidad, La Guayra (for Caracas) and Puerto Cabello ( Venezuela), Kingston (Jamaica), Havana, 
Key West, Old Point Comfort, and New York. 

This tour lasts about four and a half weeks, and offers American tourists a most attractive and com- 
fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters. 

A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure, recalling many a famous 
exploit of dead-and-gone worthies. But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely 
palm-covered beaches, of beautiful scenery and strange peoples, offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible 
fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses. In cruising from port to port in these en- 
chanted seas, among verdant and flower-clothed islands, nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful 
mood, and life in the tropics at its best. It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine any attribute of an 
ideal winter resort not found among these " Fortunate Isles." 

CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE. 



TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST.

ornamental, $1.25. 

"It is less adventurous in theme, the tone is more quiet, and the 
manner more in keeping with the so-called realistic order of fiction than 
anything Mr. Haggard has heretofore published. ' Joan Haste ' is by 
far the most earnest, and in many ways the most impressive, work of 
Mr. Haggard's that has yet been printed. The insight into character 
which it displays is almost invariably keen and true. Every personality 
in the story is fully alive, and individual traits of thought and action 
are revealed little by little as the narrative progresses, until they stand 
forth as definite and consistent creations." T/te Beacon.

is first-rate, and the story, as a story, is full of interest." Publishers'

for it is a book dealing with child-life, and that is one of the most sub- 
tle, difficult, and delicate themes that any pen can touch. Since 
' Helen's Babies ' took the reading public by storm, we question if such 
a genuine bit of baby-literature has found its way into print as this."

PAUL AND VIRGINIA OF A NORTHERN ZONE.

MANN, with introductory note by Mr. FRANCIS F. BROWNE. 

Daintily printed and bound, with cover design by Mr. 

BRUCE ROGERS. Gilt top, uncut, $1.25. Also 55 copies 

on hand-made paper, $2.50 net. 

In introducing to American readers the work of the popular Danish 
novelist, Holger Drachmann, the publishers have selected " Paul and 
Virginia of a Northern Zone " as one of the most characteristic and at- 
tractive of his shorter tales. It is a story of simple life upon a North- 
ern strand, of storm and wreck at sea, of youth and its triumphant love. 
The work is at once romantic and realistic ; written in a charming poetic 
style, with masterly descriptive power, and strong coloring from the 
scenes and life where it is laid. 

NIM AND CUM, AND THE WONDER-HEAD 
STORIES. 

By CATHARINE BROOKS YALE. Cover and decorations by 
Mr. BRUCE ROGERS. IGmo. linen, gilt top, uncut, $1.25. 
To her intimate friends, Mrs. Yale has long been known as an accom- 
plished story-teller. Some of her stories, adapted to the uses of chil- 
dren and their elders, are collected in this book. " Kim and Cum " is 
characterized by a graceful fancy and quaint humor, while the " Won- 
der-Head Stories " are full of side lights into animal and insect nature, 
as interesting as they are informing. 

THE LITTLE ROOM, AND OTHER STORIES.

piece, and decorations by the author. 1 Omo, linen, gilt top,

THE DEATH-WAKE; or, Lunacy. 

A Necromaunt in Three Chimeras by THOMAS T. STODDART. 
With an Introduction by Mr. ANDREW LANG. 16mo, car- 
dinal buckram, $1.50 net. 

Mr. Lang in his introduction says : " The extreme rarity of the 
' Death- Wake ' is a reason for its republication, which may or may not 
be approved of by collectors. Of the original edition one author says 
that more than seventy copies were sold in the first week of publication, 
but thereafter the publisher failed in business. . . . The ' Death- Wake ' 
is the work of a lad who certainly had read Keats, Coleridge, and Shelley, 
but who is no imitator of these great poets. He has, in a few passages, 
and at his best, an accent original, distinct, strangely musical, and 
really replete with promise. He has a fresh, unborrowed melody and 
mastery of words, the first indispensable sign of a true poet."

Choice Volumes for the Holidays. 

THE LEAST OF THESE, and Other Stories. By 

L. T. MEADE. Two Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, 250 pages ; 

post-paid, 75 cents. 

In their delineations of eccentric human traits they fairly rival Pearse, 
or even Dickens. Like the latter, Mr. Meade is especially pathetic in 
his presentation of child-life. The stories have a decided interest and 
value to the student of sociology. 

QRANDMONT. Stories of an Old Monastery. By WAL- 
TER T. GRIFFIN. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 272 pages; 
postpaid, $1.20. 
The Monastery of Grandmont was for five centuries a most influential 

agency in the political and ecclesiastical life of France and Europe. 

The principal character of the tale is almost wholly biographical. 

AT LAST. By MARIA ELISE LAUDER. 12mo, cloth, 310 

pages ; postpaid, 75 cents. 

Rarely is so much of travel and history and art so skilfully woven 
into the web of a delightful story. There is not a dull or uninteresting 
page from first to last. The plot is full of interest, the characters 
noble, the language chaste, the moral tone pure and strong. A splendid 
book for the home circle. 

PROVIDENTIAL EPOCHS. By FRANK M. BRISTOL, 

D.D. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 269 pages ; postpaid, $1.26. 

"The style while simple is easy, and elegant, and strong in its 

terse English sentences ; but its worth is not to be estimated from these 

standpoints so much as from the teachings of its pages. " Inter Ocean. 

NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS. By Mrs. I. T. THURSTON. 

Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 327 pages ; postpaid, $1.00. 

A charming home story. It tells of neighbors who were neighbors in- 
deed ; also, of neighbors who were not neighbors ; and shows how all bar- 
riers give way before the spirit of neighborly sympathy and helpfulness. 

ONE WOMAN'S STORY; or, The Chronicles of a Quiet 
Life. By ELLEN A. LUTZ. Dlustrated. 12rao, cloth, 309 
pages ; postpaid, $1.25. 

" It is a story of struggle and conquest, of life, of love, and of be- 
reavement ; of consolation and the development of spiritual character." 
Burlington Hawkeye.

THE DIAL, 



[Dec. 16, 



THE 

NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW 

ALWAYS CONTAINS 

The Right Topics, 

By the Right Men, 

At the Right Time. 

THE TOPICS are always those which are uppermost in the public mind in 
religion, morals, politics, science, literature, business, finance, industrial 
economy, social and municipal affairs, etc. in short, all subjects on which 
Americans require and desire to be informed. No magazine follows so closely 
from month to month the course of public interest. All subjects are treated of 
impartially on both sides. 

THE CONTRIBUTORS to the REVIEW are the men and women to whom 
the world looks for the most authoritative statements on the subjects of the 
day. No other periodical can point to such a succession of brilliant writers. 

THE TIME when these subjects are treated of by these contributors is the 
very time when the subjects are in the public mind. 

Among special features of extraordinary importance which the NOKTH AMERICAN 
REVIEW has in preparation for 1896 is a series of articles by the Rt. Hon. 

W. E. GLADSTONE ON THE FUTURE STATE, 

And the Condition of Man in it. 

The Series will begin in the January Number. 

TYPICAL EXTRACTS FROM THE VERDICT OF THE PRESS. 

Ahead of any magazine this country has ever seen 
in the importance of the topics discussed and the emi- 
nence of its contributors. Albany Argus. 

No other magazine in the world so fully and fairly 
presents the opinions of the leading writers and thinkers 
on all questions of public interest Boston Journal. 

In its discussions of current topics by distinguished 
writers it has no rival in the country. Dubuque Herald. 

It is always abreast of the world. Springfield 
(Mass.) Republican. 

Not only the oldest but the best of our Reviews 

Rochester Post-Express. 

There is no other magazine that approaches it 

N. Y. Sun. 



Cannot be ignored by the reader who keeps along 
with current discussion. Indianapolis Journal. 

Continues to grow in interest. Its discussions of 
topics of present concern are marked by ability of the 
highest order, the most eminent representatives on both 
sides being chosen to expound their theories. St. Paul 
(Minn.) Globe. 

Numbers among its writers a larger list of men and 
women distinguished in the religious, literary, and polit- 
ical world than any other periodical of the kind. It 
should find a place in every household Ellendale (N. 
D.) Leader. 

This Review is alive and could almost be described 
as a PREVIEW. The Christian Advocate (N. Y.).

These two volumes constitute, from the point of view of literature, the most important publications of the season or, 
for that matter, of several seasons. 

" The letters are so entirely in accord with the published works that they form a connecting link to bind them together, and they also supply 
the key to them. As biography, these letters are a great and lasting interest ; as literature they will take their place beside ' Culture and Anar- 
chy ' and 'Essays in Criticism.' " The Outlook. 

" There is not a dull line hi his correspondence. Their substance is one of the rarest in epistolary literature, and their style is unique, for in 
the smallest matters as in the greatest, Matthew Arnold gave the best of himself to his task ; even as a letter-writer his motto was ' Noblesse 
oblige.'" New York Tribune.

" When he is quite at his best, Crawford is worthy of comparison with writers of the past whose names are held in reverence, and in these 
chapters, hi fact nearly all through the first part of his new story, he is quite at his best. Character after character is made to stand forth 
vividly, to move and breathe, with scarcely a seeming effort at description of traits or moods ; wit and humor have free play, and the passions of 
love and hate, the devotion of the religieuse, the superstition of the ignorant, the self-sufficiency of lusty youth are denoted with satisfying art."

THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL. 

The interesting series of papers upon " The 
Public Schools of the United States," prepared 
for " Harper's Weekly " by Mr. F. W. Hewes, 
has just been made to include a discussion of 
" High Schools," which presents a large num- 
ber of interesting facts, scientifically marshalled, 
and illustrated by graphic tabulations. High 
schools are for the most part confined to the 
cities or large towns, and their students num- 
ber about twelve per cent, of the city school 
attendance, or about two per cent, of the total 
school attendance of the country. In this esti- 
mate, private institutions of high-school grade 
are included. The subject is considered under 
the six heads of distribution, coeducation, enrol- 
ment, studies pursued, sex in study, and grad- 
uation. Throughout the study, use is made of

the division of our schools into five groups 
North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Central, 
South Central, and Western employed by 
the National Commissioner of Education in his 
statistical summaries of educational work. 

The facts relating to distribution are easily 
disposed of. Taking the country as a whole, 
there are 58 high -school students for every 
thousand of population. The numbers for the 
five grand divisions are 69, 39, 67, 38, and 59, 
taking the divisions in the order above named. 
If we include the preparatory departments of 
the colleges, our numbers become 71, 43, 76, 
47, and 71, respectively, while for the whole 
country the number 58 is raised to 65. In 
other words, the two Northern divisions make 
nearly twice as good a showing as the two 
Southern ones, while the West nearly repre- 
sents the general average of the whole. The 
figures upon coeducation and enrolment reveal 
the interesting fact that our public high schools 
in all sections of the country are attended by 
about fifty per cent, more girls than boys, while 
in the private schools of similar rank, the bal- 
ance of the sexes is nearly equal, inclining 
slightly to the male side of the scale. In the 
two Atlantic divisions, particularly, many more 
boys than girls are enrolled in the private acad- 
emies. Roughly speaking, we may also say 
that the public schools outnumber in their 
attendance the private schools by more than 
two to one, while four-fifths of all the high- 
school students in the country are .found in the 
two Northern divisions. It is interesting to 
note, moreover, that two-thirds of the high- 
school work of the South is carried on by pri- 
vate enterprise. 

The statistics of " studies pursued " offer par- 
ticularly interesting results. The eight repre- 
sentative subjects selected for comparison stand 
in the following order: Algebra, Latin, phys- 
ics, geometry, German, French, chemistry, and 
Greek. Of course, the subjects that head this 
list occupy their respective places mainly by 
virtue of the fact that they are the subjects 
with which high-school courses usually begin. 
About three times as large a proportion of stu- 
dents pursue Greek and French in private 
schools as take these subjects in public institu- 
tions, while with the other subjects there is no 
marked disproportion, the balance inclining in 
favor of the public schools in most cases. The 
most instructive figures in this department are 
those relating to college preparatory work. 
About twelve per cent, of all our high-school 
students are fitting for college, and rather more 



than half the number are taking classical in- 
stead of scientific courses. But the full sig- 
nificance of the figures does not appear until 
we compare the West with the East, and the 
North with the South. In the two Southern 
divisions classics are to science in the ratio of 
eighteen to eight, while in the two Northern 
divisions they are represented by nearly equal 
percentages. It takes the West to redress 
in this respect the balance of the South, and 
in the West science is farther ahead of the 
classics than in the South the classics have the 
advantage over science. These facts are easily 
explicable. The South keeps to the fine old 
traditions of what the education of a gentleman 
should be ; the West has never had any such 
traditions to defend ; while the North has had 
to carry on a losing fight for the humanities 
against the forces that have become more and 
more aggressive and predominant in that com- 
mercial and manufacturing section. 

The diagram devoted to " Sex in Study " is 
the most complicated of them all, and offers 
some of the most startling contrasts. Greek, 
for example, we find to be studied by three 
times as many boys as girls, while more girls 
than boys study Latin. Twice as many girls 
as boys study French, while rather more boys 
than girls study German. More girls than boys 
study algebra and geometry, while physics and 
chemistry appeal about equally to both sexes. 
The statistics concerning graduation are not es- 
pecially significant, although it is an interesting 
fact that the North Central division turns out 
more graduates than all four of the remaining 
divisions. This statistical showing, taken as 
a whole, is extremely interesting, and some of 
the more salient matters, as we have pointed 
them out, offer much food for reflection. 

That the American secondary school is a 
distinctive and valuable part of our public edu- 
cational system hardly needs to be urged at 
present, although in every large community 
there is a small but aggressive minority of per- 
sons who argue that such schools are an unjust 
burden to the tax-payer. The answer to this 
argument of course is that the existence of the 
public high school involves no question of prin- 
ciple. The only principle seriously brought 
into question by reputable thinkers is that of 
the justice of any system whatever of state- 
supported education. Mr. Herbert Spencer, as 
we all know, and a small group of his fellow- 
extremists, claim that all education should be 
provided for by private enterprise. But the 
admission once made that state education is

justifiable and the recalcitrants upon this sub- 
ject are really too few to be taken into account 
the question of how far the educational sys- 
tem should go is clearly one not of principle, 
but of expediency. Whether it cover a term 
of four years, or of sixteen, or of some inter- 
mediate number, is obviously a matter to be set- 
tled by compromise, to be determined by the 
resources of a given community, and the con- 
sensus of intelligent opinion. It may possibly 
be " tyranny of the majority " to make tax- 
payers provide for any system at all of public 
education, but there is no new " tyranny " in 
the determination to make the period one of 
ten or twelve years, rather than of six or eight. 
And no one, we think, who intelligently looks 
into the workings of the American high schools, 
can reasonably claim that a dollar of public 
funds expended upon them is less advantage- 
ously employed than a dollar expended upon 
the schools of lower grade. So far, indeed, is 
such expenditure from being subject to any 
law of diminishing returns as we go upward in 
the scale, that we are rather justified in claim- 
ing that the law which prevails is one of increas- 
ing returns, and that the higher the education 
we provide at public expense the better is the 
state rewarded for its outlay. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE BULL OP DIVORCE BETWEEN HENRY VIII. 

AND KATHERINE. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

The reviewer of Ransome's " Advanced History of 
England " in THE DIAL for November 1 (p. 251) says: 
" Late research has shown that Clement VII. actually 
granted a bull of divorce between Henry VIII. and 
Katherine." 

May I ask you what authority your reviewer has for 
this statement ? CHARLES McK. LEOSER. 

Larckmont Manor, New York, Nov. 20, 1895. 

[The observation was based upon Ehses, Die 
papstlichen Decretale im Scheidungsprozesse Hein- 
richs VIII. i an abstract of which may be found in 
the Historische Jahrbucher (Vol. XI. 1888 
part 3, pp. 126-7). There has always been a tra- 
dition that the bull was granted. In Lord Herbert 
of Cherbury's " History of England under Henry 
VIII." the tenor of the decree, as it was supposed 
to be, is given, but any exact knowledge of the docu- 
ment has hitherto been impossible. The whole cor- 
respondence between England and Rome was car- 
ried on in cipher, and so apprehensive was Clement 
VII. of its purport creeping out that he kept even 
the translation of the dispatches in his own hands. 
Under pressure from Wolsey, who was in turn 
forced by the king, Clement was prevailed upon to 



issue the bull of divorce, but on condition that it 
never be made public. Campeggio, the papal legate, 
read it in the presence of Henry and Wolsey, but 
would not suffer it to pass out of his hand. Henry 
was furious, and Wolsey's fate was sealed. Accord- 
ing to Ehses, the bull was burned some time between 
the 22d and 26th of May, 1529. Later, when 
Campeggio was about to leave England, at Dover, 
Henry had the box containing his correspondence 
forced open and all his luggage searched ; but the 
document was never found. Undoubtedly the Pope, 
in his embarrassment, was simply serving the hour, 
and never intended the bull to be of legal force; 
when he at last concluded a treaty with the em- 
peror, in Lord Herbert's words, he " could no 
longer, either with the safety of his person or dig- 
nity, favor our king ; so that what excuses soever 
(in the frequent dispatches he made about this 
time) were given to our king, yet were they little 
more than complement and evasion, till finally, de- 
claring himself more openly for the emperor, he 
sign'd an advocation of the cause to himself." An 
absolute rendering of the bull is, of course, in this 
day, impossible ; Ehses has recovered so much as 
there is to be recovered, from a comparative study 
of the correspondence and the diplomatic history of 
the times. It is no serious omission in that Mr. Han- 
some has not said that the bull was actually granted, 
but such a statement would have intensified the 
high interest that has always been attached to this 
great episode in English history. REVIEWER.] 

ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENN- 
SYLVANIA. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have just received the interesting little volume 
which results from the collection of the articles on En- 
glish in American Universities published in THE DIAL. 
In the valuable Introduction, however, I find an infer- 
ence due I confess, to a want of categorical com- 
pleteness in my own contribution for the correction 
of which, as my article originally appeared in your col- 
umns, I must ask for a little of your valuable space. 
The passage runs : " From Pennsylvania comes the 
vague report that ' English literature ' is required for 
entrance." I trust that it is not a fault, in which we 
are too peculiar at the University of Pennsylvania, to 
suppose that the world is well acquainted with things 
which have always been perfectly well-known to us. 
Certain it is that it never occurred to me for a moment 
that it could be necessary to mention in my article the 
fact that the University of Pennsylvania has demanded 
the New England requirement for admission to college 
in English for many, many years, almost, indeed, from 
the year in which the New England agreement was 
reached. Although we are, I acknowledge, still quite 
as far as Harvard confesses herself to be from the 
" elimination " of " the Freshman course in theme writ- 
ing," which happy immunity one of our most Western 
sisters enjoys, we demand a higher grade of standing 
for entrance in English than for entrance in any other 
subject, and accept no student, whatever his other 
equipment, who cannot reasonably fulfil that demand.

THE ARNOLD LETTERS.* 

It is pleasant to be able to premise of the 
long-awaited "Letters of Matthew Arnold," 
now before us, that they are altogether more 
likely to exceed than to fall short of the agree- 
able anticipations the reader will probably have 
formed of them. There are antecedent reasons 
enough, both of style and personality, why Mr. 
Arnold should have excelled as a letter- writer ; 
and certainly no collection of recent years has 
surpassed the one he has left us in real biograph- 
ical value, or approached it in the distinctive 
merits and graces of epistolary writing. Per- 
haps the best summary of the letters that can 
be made is that they are (as their excellent 
editor, Mr. G. W. E. Kussell, testifies) the 
writer himself, as the members of his family 
and his closer friends were permitted to know 
him ; and there can be no higher praise of them 
than this, especially in view of the fact that it 
was Mr. Arnold's express wish that he might 
not be made the subject of a biography. No 
formal life of him by a hand other than his 
own can approach these charming volumes as 
an intimate disclosure of the personal qualities 
which the reserve, or, as Mr. Russell chooses 
to call it, the " magnificent serenity," of Mr. 
Arnold's demeanor veiled from the general 
world. Essentially familiar and domestic, and 
written without a thought of their ever passing 
beyond the limits of the family circle, the let- 
ters discover a vein of sunny geniality and play- 
fulness, a sense of fun, a capacity for little 
pleasures, in fine, a large, free, simple, and 
kindly view of life and men, that will prove a 
pleasant revelation to the many who have 
learned to vaguely figure the writer as the some- 
what supercilious apostle of the cultus of " cul- 
ture," the fastidious critic, the faultily faultless 
poet whose formal and studied excellences are 
for the few. In his " Victorian Poets " Mr. 
Stedman speaks of Matthew Arnold as impart- 
ing to his readers a vague impression that he 
cares less for man in the concrete than for man 
in the abstract "; adding that " while admiring 
his delineations of Heine, the De Guerins, Jou- 
bert, and other far-away saints or heroes, we 
feel that he possibly may overlook some pil- 
grim at his roadside-door." Now it is pre- 
cisely this general notion of Mr. Arnold (which

we venture to say is a pretty common one), this 
current impression of his coldness and aloof- 
ness, that the letters tend to dispel, as the sun 
dispels a mist- wreath. They portray for us 
unmistakably, in a hundred frank, unconscious 
touches, the kindliest and gentlest of men, the 
tender father, the unfailing friend, the Good 
Samaritan who revelled in beneficence, and 
never more than when the object of it was a 
little child, a worn schoolmistress, or a strug- 
gling author. So far from overlooking " the 
pilgrim at his roadside-door," Matthew Arnold, 
it is pleasant to learn, often " taxed his ingen- 
uity to find words of encouragement and praise 
for the most immature and unpromising efforts." 
We shall point out here what seems a flaw 
in the temper of these usually gracious letters 
the " rift in the lute " that will possibly im- 
pair their harmony for many readers. There 
is no evading the unwelcome fact that they 
contain some harsh judgments of the people of 
this country, put in a way that savors more of 
prejudice than of reasoned opinion, and pro- 
nounced at a time when Mr. Arnold's experi- 
ence of us was, for any purposes of serious in- 
duction, absolutely nil. We find, for instance, 
the apostle and presumed exemplar of " urban- 
ity," " sweetness," " open-mindedness," and 
other cardinal virtues of temper and criticism, 
long before his visit to this country, assuming 
that "the really well-bred and well-trained 
American " is " a rara avis "; holding that the 
bulk of our people are "not of fine enough 
clay to serve the higher purposes of civiliza- 
tion "; cordially agreeing with the "French 
and Italians " that the Americans are a " na- 
tion mal elevee " (" such awful specimens as 
I was in the Coliseum with ! '_' he feelingly 
adds); fearfully presaging a "wave of more 
than American vulgarity, moral, intellectual, 
and social, preparing to break over us," and 
so on. It is to such conclusions as the fore- 
going that we may ascribe the principle pro- 
pounded in a letter to his mother in 1865, that 
" to be too much with Americans is like living 
with somebody who has all one's own bad habits 
and tendencies " without having, we are led 
to infer, any considerable amount of "one's 
own " virtues and graces. It might have oc- 
curred to Mr. Arnold here that time and liberal 
institutions may well have developed in the 
American people certain good " habits and 
tendencies " which go to make their contact 
harmless and even salutary to a society com- 
posed of " an upper class materialized, a mid- 
dle class vulgarized, and a lower class brutal-

ized." Too much stress need not, of course, 
be laid on these little " Briticisms " of Mr. 
Arnold's ; although the fact that they are found 
in his private correspondence forces us to regard 
them as accurately indicating his opinion of us 
at that time. Let us rather endure them in 
the mild and forbearing spirit which enabled 
Mr. Arnold himself to lay a .wreath of im- 
perishable laurel on the grave of that Heinrich 
Heine who so bitterly satirized the English, 
and who died " firmly persuaded that a blas- 
pheming Frenchman is a more agreeable spec- 
tacle in the sight of God, than a praying En- 
glishman." 

Mr. Arnold's visit to America in 1883 plainly 
gave him a more favorable opinion of us than 
the one he had formed a priori. The tone of 
his sprightly series of letters of that date is 
friendly enough toward this country, although 
the familiar note of " a certain condescension 
in foreigners " which so tried Mr. Lowell is 
pretty clearly distinguishable. Once or twice, 
indeed, touched by the warmth of his reception, 
he seems almost on the point of thawing out 
as when, for instance, shortly after reaching 
New York, he tempers his complaints of the 
" blaring publicity of the place," and of the re- 
viewers who "render life terrible," etc., by 
graciously adding : " But the kindness and 
goodwill of everybody is wonderful, and I can- 
not but be grateful for it." A few random 
extracts from the American letters will serve 
to show their general tenor. Not a little amus- 
ing, and we may add surprising, are Mr. Ar- 
nold's curt references to people who entertained 
him at their houses during his trip through the 
States ; and the reader will possibly compare 
these references with what a Frenchman, an 
American, or even a German, in Mr. Arnold's 
position, might have felt it gracious to say 
under the circumstances. Mr. Arnold's en- 
tertainers at one city, for example, are kindly 
described as " a nice old couple called Clark "; 
at another they are merely " some rich people 
called Shepard " (one cannot help thinking of 
his famous " a native author called Roe "). 
His impressions of Chicago seem rather fa- 
vorable on the whole, although we find him 
later, in a letter from Quebec, declaring that 
he would sooner be a poor priest in that ram- 
shackle, picturesque town, than " a rich hog- 
merchant in Chicago " ! De gustibus non est 
disputandum. As to St. Louis, he holds that, 
by virtue of its being " an old place and a 
mixed place," it escapes the profound Gemein- 
heit (commonness, vulgarity) of the ordinary 



American city ; while Philadelphia he con- 
cludes to be " the most attractive city I have 
seen over here. I prefer it to Boston." In a 
New York letter Mr. Arnold expresses much 
gratification at " the way in which the people, 
far lower down than with us, live with some- 
thing of the life and enjoyments of the culti- 
vated classes." He adds : 

" The young master of the hotel asked to present his 
steward to me, as a recompense to him for his beautiful 
arrangement of palms, fruit, and flowers in the great 
hall. The German boys who wait in the hair-cutting 
room and the clerks at the photographer's express their 
delight at seeing ' a great English poet,' and ask me to 
write in their autograph books, which they always have 
ready." 

The great thorn in Mr. Arnold's side, dur- 
ing his American tour, was, of course, the 
newspapers " the worst and most disquieting 
things here," he feelingly says. One ambitious 
scribe, with a turn for metaphor, pleasantly 
likened him (as he stooped over now and then, 
on the rostrum, to refer to his notes) to " an 
elderly bird pecking at grapes on a trellis "; 
while the Chicago paper's portrait of him 
" He has harsh features, supercilious manners, 
parts his hair down the middle, wears a single 
eye-glass and ill-fitting clothes " is historical. 

Some interesting views as to educational mat- 
ters in America are outlined in a letter (1886) 
to Professor Charles Eliot Norton : 

"... I read the account of your meeting ; the 
speeches were good, but I am doubtful about your petty 
academies, just as I am more than doubtful about your 
pullulating colleges and universities. Das Gemeine is 
the American danger, and a few and good secondary 
schools and universities, setting a high standard, are 
what you seem to me to want, rather than a multitude 
of institutions which their promoters delude themselves 
by taking seriously, but which no serious person can so 
take." 

Mr. Arnold's occasional rather peevish out- 
spokenness is not wholly confined to Ameri- 
cans, there being sundry sharp little references 
in the Letters, of a quite Carlylean flavor, to 
his English literary brethren, which are much 
out of harmony with his usual gentleness and 
serenity. Of " Modern Painters " and its au- 
thor, he says, for instance : " Full of excellent 
aperqus, as usual, but the man and character 
too febrile, irritable, and weak to possess the 
ordo concatenioque veri" Mrs. Browning he 
inexplicably regards (1858) as "hopelessly 
confirmed in her aberration from health, na- 
ture, beauty, and truth "; the luckless Profes- 
sor Blackie is put down as " an esprit as con- 
fused and hoity toity as possible, and as capable 
of translating Homer as of making the Apollo

Belvedere "; while the author of " Laus Ven- 
eris " figures as " a sort of pseudo-Shelley called 
Swinburne " a characterization that will be 
relished by not a few victims of Mr. Swin- 
burne's own caustic pen. More temperate in 
statement, though scarcely less surprising in 
judgment, is this reference to Tennyson (1864): 
" I do not think Tennyson a great and powerful spirit 
in any line as Goethe was in the line of modern 
thought, Byron even in that of passion, Wordsworth in 
that of contemplation; and unless a poet, especially a 
poet at this time of day, is that, my interest in him is 
only slight, and my conviction that he will not stand 
high is firm." 

In a letter of 1869, Mr. Arnold makes a 
frank critical estimate of his own poetical work 
as compared with that of his two great English 
contemporaries, which is doubly interesting in 
view of the prediction already made by influ- 
ential critics in England, that of the three poets 
Mr. Arnold is destined to rank the highest in 
the not remote future. 

M My poems represent, on the whole, the main move- 
ment of mind of the last quarter of a century, and thus 
they will probably have their day as people become con- 
scious to themselves of what that movement of mind is, 
and interested in the literary productions that reflect 
it. It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical 
sentiment than Tennyson, and less intellectual vigor 
and abundance than Browning; yet, because I have per- 
haps more of a fusion of the two than either of them, 
and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main 
line of modern development, I am likely enough to have 
my turn, as they have had theirs." 

Writing to his sister, Mrs. W. E. Forster, in 
1859, Mr. Arnold draws another interesting 
personal comparison this time with M. Re- 
nan, whose line of endeavor bore a certain 
resemblance to his own : 

" The difference is, perhaps, that he tends to incul- 
cate morality, in a high sense of the word, upon the 
French nation as what they most want, while I tend to 
inculcate intelligence, also in a high sense of the word, 
upon the English nation as what they most want; but 
with respect both to morality and intelligence, I think 
we are singularly at one in our ideas, and also with re- 
spect both to the progress and the established religion 
of the present day. . . . Renan pushes the glorification 
of the Celts too far; but there is a great deal of truth 
in what he says, and being on the same ground in my 
next lecture, in which I have to examine the origin of 
what is called the ' Romantic ' sentiment about women, 
which the Germans are quite fond of giving themselves 
the credit of originating, I read him with the more 
interest." 

The following lively account of his meeting 
(1880) with Cardinal Newman, at the Duchess 
of Norfolk's, shows Mr. Arnold in an unfamiliar 
vein : 

"I went to the dinner because I wanted to have 
spoken once in my life to Newman, and because I wanted 
to see the house. The house was not so fine as I ex- 



pected. Newman was in costume not full Cardinal's 
costume, but a sort of vest with gold about it and the 
red cap; he was in state at one end of the room, with 
the Duke of Norfolk on one side of him and a chap- 
lain on the other, and people filed before him as before 
the Queen, dropping on their knees when they were 
presented and kissing his hand. It was the faithful 
who knelt in general, but then it was in general only 
the faithful who were presented. That old mountebank 
Lord * dropped on his knees, however, and mum- 
bled the Cardinal's hand like a piece of cake. I only 
made a deferential bow, and Newman took my hand in 
both of his and was charming." 

As we have already said, the bulk of the let- 
ters are family letters, forming together a f airly 
continuous record of the writer's life from day 
to day. Cheery and buoyant as they generally 
are, one reads nevertheless between the lines 
no faint inkling of the writer's consciousness 
of the hardship of a lot which condemned him 
to sacrifice the best that was in him to a long; 

O 

round of ill-paid drudgery in an office which 
many a man of middling capacity might have 
filled as well, perhaps better. The relative 
scantiness of his poetic production is as easy 
as Gray's is difficult to divine. He says (writ- 
ing to Mrs. Forster): 

" To produce my best is no light matter with an exist- 
ence so hampered as mine is. People do not under- 
stand what a temptation there is, if you cannot bear 
anything not very good, to transfer your operations to a 
region where form is everything. Perfection of a cer- 
tain kind may there be attained, or at least approached, 
without knocking yourself to pieces, but to attain or 
approach perfection in the region of thought and feel- 
ing, and to unite this with perfection of form, demands 
not merely an effort and a labor, but an actual tearing 
of one's self to pieces, which one does not readily con- 
sent to unless one can devote one's whole life to poetry. 
Wordsworth could give his whole life to it, Shelley and 
Byron both could, and were besides driven by their 
demon to do so. Tennyson, a far inferior natural power 
to either of the three, can; but of the moderns Goethe 
is the only one, I think, of those who have had an exist- 
ence assujettie, who has thrown himself with a great re- 
sult into poetry." 

It remains to say that Mr. Eussell's editing 
of these letters is satisfactory in the main 
helpful, careful, and commendably unobtrusive. 
The foot-notes are excellent, as is the brief in- 
troductory. The German words, of which Mr. 
Arnold used a good many, are sometimes in- 
correctly printed, as, for example, " Militar" 
" hubsch," " Konig" and so on ; and it is to 
be sincerely hoped that subsequent editions of 
this charming and monumental work will be 
provided with what are very essential to its 
convenience and usefulness, a table of contents 
and an index. E. G. J.

Mr. Henry Van Dyke, who is well known as 
a writer on Tennyson, gives us in his latest 
book a series of outdoor vacation studies, which 
he has entitled " Little Rivers." Some of this 
material has appeared in " Scribner's Maga- 
zine." The first essay contains general obser- 
vations and reflections somewhat after the man- 
ner of Thoreau, the chief of river-lovers. With 
Thoreau, Mr. Van Dyke thinks a river the 
most companionable object in nature, though 
he fails to note what was with Thoreau the 
greatest attraction, namely, its " liberating in- 
fluence." " A river," says Thoreau, " is su- 
perior to a lake in its liberating influence. It 
has motion and indefinite length." The " lit- 
tle rivers " of which our author tells us are 
various fishing-streams of the Adirondacks, 
Canada, Scotland, Italy, and Switzerland ; and 
the story is mainly of angling and connected 
experiences and various converse with simple 
humanity and simple Nature. Mr. Van Dyke's 
style is graceful ; as a sample of it we quote 
the description of a lady (Mrs. Van Dyke?) 
angling for that gamiest of all fish, " the fight- 
ing ouaniche, the little salmon of the St. John : 

" The grasshopper was attached to the hook, and cast- 
ing the line well out across the pool, Ferdinand put the 
rod into Greygown's hands. She stood poised upon a 
pinnacle of rock, like Patience on a monument, waiting 
for a bite. It came. There was a slow, gentle pull at 
the line, answered by a quick jerk of the rod, and a 
noble fish flashed into the air. Four pounds and a half 
at least! He leaped again and again, shaking the drops 
from his silvery sides. He rushed up the rapids as if 
he had determined to return to the lake, and down 
again as if he had changed his plans and determined to 
go to the Saguenay. He sulked iu the deep water and 
rubbed his nose against the rocks. He did his best to 
treat that treacherous grasshopper as the whale served 
Jonah. But Greygown, through all her little screams 
and shouts of excitement, was steady and sage. She

never gave the fish an inch of slack line ; and at last he 
lay glittering on the rocks, with the black St. Andrew's 
crosses clearly marked on his plump sides, and the iri- 
descent spots gleaming on his small, shapely head." 

The book is prefaced by a poetic prologue and 
closes with a poetic epilogue. It is illustrated 
with a number of passable drawings. 

Mr. C. A. Stoddard, editor of the " New 
York Observer," in " Cruising among the 
Caribbees," gives an account of a midwinter 
excursion in the steamer " Madiana " to the 
Lesser Antilles. Short stops were made at a 
large number of islands, from St. Thomas to 
Trinidad. Mr. Stoddard met with no very 
striking adventures ; however, as a specimen 
of his style we quote a description of the Trini- 
dad pitch lake : 

" A vast black lake with multitudes of circles such 
as are made when a stone is thrown into water, gives a 
fair idea of the appearance from a little distance. 
When one comes to walk over the pitch, for it is solid 
enough to walk over, he finds deep pools and channels 
of water, and places where the pitch bubbles up with a 
yellowish scum and a sulphurous smell. If he stands 
long in one place after the sun is high, his feet sink 
gradually; and horses and carts which load the material 
only remain a few moments in the same spot. When 
pieces of pitch are taken out, nature at once begins to 
repair the damage, and in twenty-four hours the hole is 
filled up again. We saw the process beginning in a 
dozen different places. Besides the curious sight of lit- 
tle islands of rich vegetation rising out of this black 
plain, there were here and there great pieces of wood 
sticking up endwise, having apparently come up through 
the pitch, for they had crowns of pitch on the end which 
rose two or three feet above the surface." 

The outlook for the Caribbean Islands Mr. 
Stoddard represents as very discouraging, ow- 
ing to the depression in the sugar trade. Some 
useful but mostly second-hand information is 
conveyed in a sober and straightforward style. 
But our excursionist necessarily records only 
hasty and rather superficial impressions and 
reflections, which, though perhaps serviceable 
for newspaper letters, seem scarcely worthy of 
book form. This volume is illustrated by cuts 
from photographs, but it lacks a map. 

Mr. Francis Tiffany's book, This Goodly 
Frame the Earth," consists of brief notes of a 
round-the-world trip in the customary route. 
The author is, as we judge from internal evi- 
dence, a clergyman of truly catholic spirit and 
thoughtful mind. The book is too full of re- 
flection of a rather commonplace sort, though 
occasionally there is a suggestive remark, as 
this on the much-praised Japanese courtesy and 
superior civilization : 

" After awhile, every man of frank, unconventional 
nature begins to hate this manner for its false, its shal-

low, its monotonous excess, and in his wrath to say, 
' Till the Japanese have worse manners, they will never 
learn genuine courtesy ! Till they get rid of their masks, 
they will never understand the social charm of the free 
play of joy, love, sorrow! ' . . . There is nothing behind 
the Japanese face politically, morally, intellectually, 
reverentially that can hold a moment's comparison 
with that which is behind the faces of those who are 
free-born heirs of our complex, magnificent, historical 
past. Strange ignorance of this is it which has led so 
many travellers to attribute to the Japanese a depth of 
quality that in the nature of things, the order of evolu- 
tion, can in no way belong to them ; and until one sees 
into the simplicity and even the monotony albeit a 
' monotony of endless variety,' that is characteristic 
alike of their literature, their poetry, their architecture, 
their music, their politics, and even of their art, he will 
never read them with discrimination." 

This seems to us a truer statement than the 
panegyrics of Sir Edwin Arnold or of Messrs. 
Hearn and Finck. The author's account of 
his stay in Japan is, in fact, much the best part 
of the book. As an explorer of temples, he 
saw some odd scenes. Thus, " in many of the 
Shinto temples," he says, " the awful-looking 
war-gods . . . are seen literally covered with 
innumerable spit-balls, thrown by devotees. . . . 
Thus have the worshippers signified that they 
mean business." Mr. Tiffany's style is chatty, 
too profuse in allusion, and too staccato. While 
his book is of no high quality or importance, it 
may yet serve with some, especially those of 
the writer's own profession, for an hour or two 
of pleasant desultory reading. 

Another American clergyman, the Rev. J. 
M. Alexander, in " The Islands of the Pacific," 
gives an account of Christian foreign mis- 
sions, with the avowed aim of promoting inter- 
est therein. The several chapters give a short 
description and history of the various groups 
and an account of missionary labors. The 
book seems to be a fairly reliable compilation, 
and of special interest to Sunday-schools and 
missionary societies. Mr. Alexander takes an 
optimistic view of missions in the South Seas, 
and there they have undoubtedly been highly 
successful. Yet as the islands become less and 
less isolated from the general struggle of life, 
and more and more infected by the vicious ele- 
ments of our civilization, it is a grave question 
whether or not the native races of the Pacific 
have sufficient stamina to long survive. It 
seems one sad duty of Christianity to minister 
at the death-beds of races. This book is pro- 
vided with crude maps and an abundance of 
process cuts, some of them very interesting. 

Miss Woolson's papers on Mentone, Cairo, 
and Corfu are reprinted, with some changes, 
from " Harper's Magazine." The one on Men- 



tone takes the form of a story of a party of 
travellers in which a professor, a Miss Tres- 
cott, and others figure who have varied ex- 
periences, and chat agreeably and brightly 
thereabout. Miss Woolson shows her literary 
deftness in this slight narrative, in which bol- 
uses of sound information are often popped 
down our unsuspecting throats. But her re- 
markable feeling for style signally fails her 
when she makes the Professor say of the Corni 
ice-road : " The genius of Napoleon, Miss Tres- 
cott, caused this wonderful road to spring from 
the bosom of the mighty rock." The accounts 
of Cairo and Corfu are straightforward descrip- 
tions, without the guise of a conversation among 
a party of travellers. That of Corfu and the 
Ionian Sea, being the least hackneyed subject, 
is perhaps the most interesting in the book. 
Corfu is for Miss Woolson the isle of magical 
light and beauty : 

" Although the voyage from Brindisi hardly occupies 
twelve hours, the atmosphere is utterly unlike that of 
Italy; there is no haze (which is not in the least a mist), 
that soft veil which makes the mountains look as if they 
were covered with velvet. But a love of this softness 
need not, I hope, make us hate everything that is dif- 
ferent. Greece (and Corfu is a Greek island) seemed 
to me all light the lightest country in the world. . . . 
The mountains, the hills, the fields, are sometimes 
bathed in lilac. Then comes violet for the plains, while 
the mountains are rose that deepens into crimson. At 
other times, salmon, pink, and purple tinges are seen, 
and ochre, saffron, and cinnamon brown. This descrip- 
tion applies to the whole of Greece, but among the 
Ionian Islands the effect of the color is doubled by the 
wonderful tint of the surrounding sea. I promise not 
to mention this hue again ; hereafter it can be taken for 
granted, for it is always present; but for this once I 
must say that you may imagine the bluest blue you 
know the sky, lapis lazuli, sapphires, the eyes of some 
children, the Bay of Naples and the Ionian Sea is 
bluer than any of these." 

While this volume cannot add much to our 
knowledge or to Miss Woolson's reputation, it 
is on the whole a readable and pleasant record. 
The book is illustrated with a large number of 
soft and pretty wood engravings. 

In Mr. Alfred Parsons's book on Japan, we 
have an artist's notes during a sketching and 
painting tour in the Land of the Chrysanthe- 
mum. Japan is a paradise for two classes of 
persons children and artists ; and Mr. Par- 
sons, like all his predecessors, luxuriates in the 
quiet and simple beauty of Japanese art and 
life. He makes some interesting remarks on 
the nature of Japanese art : 

" The Japanese treatment of landscape is not more- 
conventional than that of Claude or David Cox, or than 
the shorthand of our pencil-sketches, but it records its 
facts in a different way. The everlasting question in 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

art is the imitation of nature ; it has never been carried 
further in certain directions than by Millais and his pre- 
Raphaelite brethren, or in others than by Manet, Monet, 
and other modern French, but no one can put in every- 
thing; look at a simple bunch of leaves in sunlight 
against a wall, and think how long it would take to 
really imitate all their complexities of form, color, and 
light and shade ; some facts can only be given by ignor- 
ing others, and the question what is the important thing 
which must be insisted on is the personal affair of each 
individual artist in every country where art is unfet- 
tered and alive. But in Japanese, as in Byzantine and 
other Eastern arts, this question is still decided by the 
practice of past generations, and it will take all the vi- 
tality of a strong man to infuse new life into it without 
destroying its many exquisite qualities. Perhaps when 
Japanese artists absorb its spirit instead of merely try- 
ing to imitate its methods, Western art may help in 
the direction of freedom ; at present I fear its influence 
has done more harm than good." 

In their appreciation of nature, and in their 
art, the Japanese are traditionalists, and so have 
little real life and force of individuality ; this, 
at least, is Mr. Parsons's impression. But the 
bulk of his book has little substance, though 
it is written in an easy and, in general, accu- 
rate style. The many drawings by the author 
are the feature of the volume. The portrait 
of O Kazu San is a most delightful bit of 
genre, though slightly marred in the press- 
work. The cuts on pages 73 and 91 also seem 
damaged by imperfect press-work. 

Mr. E. L. Weeks is another painter-trav- 
eller who gives us by pen and pencil his im- 
pressions of Asiatic life, but in a region far 
to the west. Mr. Weeks's route was from 
Trebizond on the Black Sea by caravan to Bu- 
shire on the Persian Gulf, thence by steamer 
to Kurrachee on the confines of India, and 
thence by rail through a large part of Hindos- 
tan. As far as Julfa in Persia he was accom- 
panied by Mr. Theodore Child, who succumbed, 
near there, to an attack of typhoid fever. The 
first part of the journey is described under the 
form of a journal, the rest under topical heads, 
" Lahore and the Punjaub," " A Painter's Im- 
pressions of Rajpootana," etc. Mr. Weeks 
often writes in an entertaining way, as we may 
illustrate by a selection from his description of 
a ride to Jodhpore on a little branch railway 
belonging to the Rajah : 

"When we reached a village, or even a flag-house, 
with a collection of mud huts in the background, we 
made a lengthy halt, and when the engineer met an ac- 
quaintance we came to a standstill; and on all occa- 
sions the gaunt, jackal-faced village dogs trotted along- 
side for miles, looking up wistfully for the chance bone 
or crust of bread, or they ran on ahead and barked at 
the engine. These capricious halts did not, as might 
be supposed, subject us to the risk of collision, since our 
train composed the company's entire rolling stock. A 



dapper little Thakor or princeling of some sort entered 
the other compartment of our carriage at one of the 
way stations, and his crowd of retainers got into third- 
class carriages some distance off. As he stepped out at 
every station to issue orders to his people, we had sev- 
eral opportunities of observing him. He was a fair 
type of the Jodhpore swell, young, with a budding mus- 
tache and hair brought down in a large glistening curl 
over each cheek. His small pink turban, dainty as a 
lady's breakfast-cap, was cocked jauntily on one side, 
and he wore a caftan of striped and rainbow-tinted 
silk; he kindled a fresh cigarette at each station, and 
his little air of insolent swagger was quite in harmony 
with the rakish set of his turban and his aggressive side- 
locks. ... At one of these stations, where he sent a 
servant to look for a clean handkerchief among his lug- 
gage, the train had to wait until it was forthcoming." 

The accounts of Jodhpore and Bikanir, quite 
remote and little-visited points, are especially 
interesting. While Mr. Weeks is a pilgrim 
in search of the beautiful, he does not neglect 
other aspects, but discourses very intelligently 
of things military, economic, and social. The 
book lacks what every well-regulated book of 
travels should have, a map. On the whole, 
Mr. Weeks has given us a pleasant and instruc- 
tive volume both in letter-press and illustration.

THE MIDDLE -AGE CONCEPTION or 
VIRGIL,.* 

The intelligent reader of the present day, as 
he becomes more thoroughly acquainted with 
the poems of Virgil, and the facts of the poet's 
life which have come down to us, is more and 
more impressed that he is dealing with a man 
who, were he permitted to recross the irremea- 
bilis unda, would fall naturally into his place as 
the congenial companion of the choicest spirits 
of the nineteenth century civilization. Even 
the fact that his development took place amid 
pre-Christian and pagan influences would make 
much less difference than we might at first sup- 
pose, since he was singularly free from the 
characteristic vices of paganism, and singularly 
near to the fundamental virtues of Christian 
civilization. We are safe, therefore, in assum- 
ing for modern times a saner appreciation of 
the personality of the poet than has been pos-

sible at any former period subsequent to the 
Augustan age itself. 

That the long-continued gloom between these 
two outbursts of intellectual light should give 
rise to distorted visions of his life and charac- 
ter was inevitable. An occasional trace of these 
distortions appears in modern literature, as in 
Scott's note to the Lay of the Last Minstrel, 
II., 17, where the unquenchable lamp that 
burned in the tomb of Michael Scott, the magi- 
cian, leads to the quotation of a story from the 
Virgilius of John Doesborcke, according to 
which the poet has himself cut to pieces and 
pickled down in a barrel, in order to be reju- 
venated by the dripping from a magic lamp 
under which the barrel was placed. But no 
systematic collection of these stories existed 
until the publication, in 1872, of the first Ital- 
ian edition of Compare tti's Virgilio nel Medio 
Evo, an English translation of which, from the 
proof-sheets of the second edition, is now be- 
fore us. 

In point of exhaustive research, Professor 
Comparetti seems to have left almost nothing 
whatever for any subsequent investigator to do. 
The work is divided into two parts, the first 
dealing with " The Vergil of Literary Tradi- 
tion," and covering the period from the poet's 
own time down to the age of Dante. This goes, 
of course, beyond the apparent limits of the 
title ; but the reader will at once see the neces- 
sity for this in a work which aims to explain, 
as well as relate, the facts under consideration. 
It must be said, however, that in numerous 
portions of the book one finds page after page 
of matter so indirectly connected with Virgil 
as fairly to raise the question whether the prom- 
inence of the poet's name in the title is strictly 
justified. The most important thread running 
through this portion of the work is the inex- 
pugnable position of the Virgilian poems in 
the schools of Rhetoric and Grammar, which 
made it impossible that their author should be 
forgotten, however unable it might be to pre- 
vent misconceptions of his character. The stu- 
dent of Dante, even more than the student of 
Virgil, will find matter of interest and profit in 
the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters, wherein 
the connection between the two poets is so dis- 
cussed as clearly to display the wide range of 
Comparetti's attainments in both the classical 
and the medieval fields. 

The second part treats of " The Vergil of 
Popular Legend "; and the distinction between 
a popular and a literary tradition, running down 
through the ages in parallel but separate course, 



is a point which the author is careful to main- 
tain. It would be interesting to enter at length 
into the substance of these legends, but space 
will not permit. It is enough to say that the 
sensible, scholarly, and unassuming Virgil of 
actual fact grew now into an inspired prophet 
of the advent of Christianity, and even an ac- 
tual preacher of its doctrines, in full detail ; 
now into the guardian of his country, building 
a temple with images which would indicate 
automatically the outbreak of war in any por- 
tion of the Empire ; now into the beneficent 
wonder-worker, able to construct a bronze horse 
which had the effect of preventing other horses 
from becoming sway-backed, a bronze fly which 
prevented other flies from entering the city of 
Naples, shambles upon which meat would re- 
tain its freshness, etc., etc.; now into a devotee 
of the Black Art, consorting with devils, learn- 
ing the secrets of their power and surpassing 
them in their own cunning ; and now into an 
amorous gallant, as far from the author of the 
^Eneid, in his relations with women, as one can 
easily imagine. 

The genesis of the ascription of magical 
power to Virgil, Comparetti traces to the folk- 
lore of the city of Naples, where the poet long 
maintained his residence, and near which he 
was buried. This view had been generally ac- 
cepted until the appearance of Mr. J. S. Tuni- 
son's "Master Virgil, "the first editions of which 
are dated 1888 and 1890, respectively. Mr. 
Tunison, whose proneness to penetrate such 
byways of literature is a matter of tradition at 
his old college home, began the study of these 
legends before he was aware of Comparetti's 
work, but availed himself thoroughly of what 
the latter had done before his own book was 
prepared for publication. He maintains that 
Comparetti has " overdrawn the indebtedness 
of the literature of the twelfth century to Nea- 
politan folk-lore"; that the absence of these 
legends from the lore of Naples to-day " is the 
complement of the fact that they never had 
any vital relation to the people of that city "; 
that a literary rather than a popular origin is 
indicated by the fact that " the various phases 
of the legends correspond respectively to the 
diverse phases of Virgil's personality and learn- 
ing, as reflected in classical and post-classical 
criticism "; that there is no necessity for the 
presumption " that the populace were ever any- 
thing but followers in the adaptation of magical 
fables to the fame of Virgil "; and finally 
the central point in his theory that the con- 
nection of these stories (in substance, of almost 



1895.] 



THE DIAL

world- wide circulation) with the name of Vir- 
gil was due " to a disposition in writers and 
readers favorable to a specific mode of romance 
writing. A certain kind of incident was credi- 
ble, when related of a sorcerer. The romances 
which included this species of incident were 
popular. Therefore the romances were writ- 
ten, regardless of facts, and even in defiance of 
facts that were generally known." Connec- 
tion with famous names of antiquity naturally 
increased the popularity of such stories, and 
what name more obvious than that of the author 
of the ./Eneid ? In harmony with the theory 
is the fact, not adequately accounted for by 
Comparetti, that this attribution of magical 
power first appears not in Italian writers but in 
the Norman Latinists of England and France, 
spreading into Italy last of all. In order to 
account for this latter fact Comparetti is driven 
to attribute to the Italian writers of the time 
a less degree of the intellectual darkness of the 
Middle Ages than is perhaps their just due. 
Mr. Tunison supports his position with ability, 
and the various legends fall naturally, under his 
treatment, into a classification based upon their 
relation to the salient points in the poet's life 
and work. That Comparetti, in his new edi- 
tion, should take no further notice of this work 
than to stamp it in a footnote as " crude and 
illogical reasoning " speaks more loudly for his 
determination to stand by his own thesis than 
for his scientific spirit or his courtesy, and is 
the more inexcusable when we consider the 
repeated and emphatic praise which Mr. Tuni- 
son has bestowed upon him. As to crudity, 
Professor Crane ("The Nation," No. 1228) was 
putting it very mildly when he said that Mr. 
Tunison's work was " more attractive for the 
general reader in form and style " than that 
of Comparetti. It may be added that the same 
authority credited Mr. Tunison with doing his 
work "so thoroughly as to leave little room 
for criticism or suggestion." In the matter of 
logic, too, Comparetti is open to attack at 
other points than those assailed by Mr. Tuni- 
son. He repeatedly fails to distinguish between 
" Christianity " and various vagaries into which 
the organized Church of the Middle Ages was 
led by perversities of human nature having no 
fundamental connection with Christianity, and 
as wide-spread, both in geographical distribu- 
tion and in recorded history, as the human 
race : a fallacy from which Tunison keeps him- 
self free, when dealing with the same subject- 
matter. Comparetti has a private right, of 
course, to his bias against Christianity, but in 



at least two cases he has dragged it unneces- 
sarily into this work ; once when he sees in 
the birth of Christ the advent of one who " was 
to drive mankind so far back and down from 
the height of civilization which they had then 
attained," and again when he asserts that 
" those who maintain that woman owes a deep 
debt of gratitude to Christianity . . . main- 
tain what is contrary to the facts." 

Mr. Tunison takes a more favorable view of 
the amount of knowledge which the Middle 
Ages possessed than does Comparetti. " It is 
presumed," says he, " that the reader knows 
the Middle Ages not to have been the time of 
ignorance described by the common run of 
writers since the so-called revival of learning. 
If he does not know this he will need to be told 
that, considered as literature, and not as a mere 
philological stalking-horse, the poems of Vir- 
gil were as widely read and as well understood 
in the twelfth century as they are to-day." For 
this assertion he was taken to task by the late 
Professor Sellar, in the " Classical Review " 
(JIL, 265), and this led him to the preparation 
of a paper published in two parts in the " Deni- 
son Quarterly" under the caption of "Virgil 
and the Twelfth Century Poets." In this pa- 
per the traces of a thorough literary acquaint- 
ance with Virgil in the works of two represen- 
tative twelfth century poets, Joseph of Exeter 
and Gunther, a German monk, are carefully 
followed out. 

But I have far transcended my limits, and 
must close with the wish that the " almost mar- 
vellous celerity " with which Professor Robin- 
son Ellis tells us that Mr. Benecke translated 
Comparetti's book had been held sufficiently in 
check to obviate such absurdities of expression 
as " This was merely a tribute . . . and are 
no indication," " like Prudentius . . . and so 
many other Christian poets did" the repeated 
misplacing of the adverb only, etc., etc. The 
absence of any index is utterly inexcusable. 
We have seen no book in five years the full 
value of which was so absolutely dependent 
upon an exhaustive index as is the case with 
this. Has not the time arrived when reputable 
publishers should refuse to put their imprint 
upon such a book without an adequate index ?

RECENT AMERICAN FICTION.* 



"Casa Braccio" fills two volumes, but might 
easily have been compressed into one. Mr. Craw- 
ford's fatal habit of indulging in commonplace philo- 
sophical reflections, of insisting upon the obvious, 
has doubtless now become so confirmed that he is 
not likely to succeed in breaking loose from it. It is 
all done very neatly, to be sure, but with the neat- 
ness that somehow suggests the exasperating per- 
fection of a copy-book model. In this book, for the 
rest, Mr. Crawford appears at his best. The one 
subject that he knows better than any other is that 
of the Roman life of a generation ago, and to this 
subject he returns in " Casa Braccio," handling it 
with the ease born of long practice and close famil- 
iarity. A more than usually pronounced tinge of 
melodrama marks the book at several critical junc- 
tures, and certainly adds nothing to its strength. 
The author employs the trick of using some of his 
stock characters over again, performing it so deftly 
that the impression is pleasant, and helps noticeably 
to sustain the illusion that we are living with him 
in a world of real men and women. In the pres- 
ent instance, our old friend Paul Griggs plays an 
important role, and our newer acquaintance Crowdie 
is partly accounted for. When he makes one of 
his characters poison herself with " hydrocyanide 
of potassium," Mr. Crawford's usually accurate in- 
formation fails him for once. " Casa Braccio " is 
the author's twenty -fifth novel, which is doing 
fairly well for a career of fifteen years. 

The personality of Liszt is the central fact in 
Mr. Bagby's Weimar Idyl." To this the love affair 
of " Miss Traumerei " and her American tenor, the 
petty gossip of the natives, and the intrigues and 
jealousies of the music-students are subordinated, 
although they all play their part in the development 
of the story. The book, like nearly all musical 
novels, is over -emotional, and lacking in a nice 
sense of proportion. The oppressive sentimentality 
of its atmosphere, the effusive hero-worship of the 
little group clustered about the Meister and made 
more or less daft by the association, are elements

of weakness in a story which may, nevertheless, in- 
fect with some measure of its own contagious en- 
thusiasm the musically-minded reader. Perhaps it 
is well not to bear too hard upon defects that spring 
from exaggeration of reverence, seeing how greatly 
we need that quality in our literature as in our life. 
The title of the new novel by Mr. Brander Mat- 
thews" His Father's Son " almost tells its own 
story, so frequently does the moralist find occasion 
to note the degeneracy of our wealthy families in 
the second generation. We should say that if ever 
the great American novel gets to be written it is 
bound to give conspicuous embodiment to this dis- 
heartening fact. It matters little whether the for- 
tune of the parent has been honestly or dishonestly 
won, it proves a curse to the son in so many cases 
that the rule comes near to being established. The 
heedlessness of parents, coupled with the enervation 
of luxurious surroundings and the contagion of the 
associations that cluster about the possession of 
wealth in all but rare instances, make up a combina- 
tion of circumstances that comparatively few young 
men have the stamina to resist and to conquer. No 
ideal is more in need of inculcation in our Amer- 
ican society than the Goethean 

" Was du ererbt von deinen Vatern hast, 
Erwirb es, um es zu besitzen," 

and no worthy ideal of conduct, it must be added, 
is less frequently sought after and attained. We 
cannot help regretting that Mr. Matthews should 
not have made more than he has of so great a 
theme. His typical case of moral disintegration is 
rapidly sketched from surface indications ; not from 
within, as it must be to become effective. In this 
treatment the dramatic bent of the author is appar- 
ent ; he may say that the psychology of the matter 
is to be understood, but in a novel we may rightly 
ask for a certain amount of explicit psychology. 
The addition of this element to the others so skil- 
fully compounded would certainly have added much 
to the force of the novel, and without more of it 
than is given us the awakening of vicious instincts 
in his hero is not adequately accounted for. As a 
study of the sinister side of Wall Street financier- 
ing, the book is a marked success ; its thrusts are 
keen, and its logic is convincing. 

" The American in Paris " may best be described 
as an anecdote history of the Franco-Prussian War, 
the siege of Paris, and the Commune, interspersed 
with numerous quotations from state papers and 
personal memoirs the whole treated in a style of 
sophomorical flamboyancy. The story, aside from 
this, is hardly worth mentioning, and any attempt 
to account rationally for the extraordinary conduct 
of the American hero is quite beyond our powers. 
The author, we suspect, is a jingo, and it is well- 
known that the jingo scorns the commonplace in- 
tellectual processes of ordinary mortals. So pre- 
tentious and badly-written a book has not often 
come into our clutches. 

" Bunch-Grass Stories " is as pretty a name as 
another, and in the case of Mrs. Bates's collection

it serves as pretext for an exceptionally graceful 
cover design. We presume that bunch-grass is a 
characteristically Western product, for all but two 
of the eight stories are told of the West the West 
of the later settlements and " seek to embody the 
spirit of the transition time." Mrs. Bates, we may 
say at the outset, has been surprisingly successful 
in her task. She has known at first-hand the fron- 
tier life whereof she writes, and her tales bear out 
the statement that it was " full of zest." More than 
once they suggest the similar work of Mr. Bret 
Harte, and their direct, picturesque, vivid quality 
stirs the blood with a keen sense of the robust life 
which they depict. Perhaps the most striking thing 
about them is that they should have been written 
by a woman, for their point of view is distinctly 
masculine, and we listen in vain to catch the fem- 
inine note. If we catch it at all, it is in the two 
stories " of other days and other wheres," which we 
cannot but feel to be misplaced in this group. They 
are fantastic and unreal ; their fellows are throbbing 
with vigorous life. The contrast is as great as pos- 
sible between " The Great Concern " and the story 
of Iphigenia at Aulis, and it is almost wholly in 
favor of the former. 

Three or four longish stories and a couple of very 
short ones are the contents of Mrs. Cruger's new 
volume. We should infer that they were the sweep- 
ings of the writer's desk, so inferior are they to the 
greater part of her work. They are mostly about 
people of intense emotions, and their atmosphere is 
that of the hot-house. Their artificiality and crude- 
ness of coloring produce an unpleasant effect, and 
the occasional clever touches do little to counteract 
it. They are, moreover, for the most part sadly 
lacking in the constructive art that the writer has, 
in some of her longer works, shown herself to pos- 
sess. 

Holland has provided inspiration for artists of 
many sorts, but rarely for more genuine and sym- 
pathetic work than Mrs. King's " Kitwyk Stories." 
There are just a dozen of them, linked by a com- 
mon scene and common characters, vividly depict- 
ing the quaint life of a sleepy Dutch town, and 
brimming with alternate humor and pathos. They 
range from grave to gay, from burlesque to tragedy, 
and every episode is a delight. Who could forget, 
for example, the story of the dominie expounding 
scripture from his pulpit, and all the time guiltily 
conscious of the fact that his coat-tail pockets con- 
ceal a fragmentary sausage, and that the sacristan's 
dog, keen upon the scent, is lurking somewhere be- 
hind. As for " The Wild Huntsmen of Kitwyk," 
whose exploits are wrought in a vast cabbage-patch, 
and whose only embarrassment is that the rabbits 
are so tame that they will not get far enough away 
to be properly aimed at, the humor of the situation 
is entirely irresistible. The thing is as good, in its 
way, as Tartarin's lion-hunt in the Algerian cab- 
bage-patch. In fact, there are many scenes in Mrs. 
King's book that suggest the doings of the Taras- 
connais, and M. Daudet, had he been a Dutchman, 



might have written of the good burghers of Kitwyk 
in a similar strain. The cover of the book, in blue 
Delft, and the drawings by Messrs. Edwards and 
Sterner, harmonize with the text, and add not a lit- 
tle to the charm of this delightful book. 

Miss Goodloe's " College Girls " are healthy and 
well-bred specimens of feminine humanity, and she 
contrives to interest us in their doings. They are 
denizens of Wellesley College, and their thoughts 
are not all of books. Each one of the fourteen 
stories in this collection is based upon a distinct 
idea, worked out with skilful economy, and produces 
a singular impression of completeness. This fact, 
together with the touches of comedy and sentiment 
that alternately enliven the pages, gives artistic value 
to what is otherwise a slight performance. If such 
a book has any lesson, it is that the higher educa- 
tion of woman does not make her any less feminine 
than she would be without it. 

Two volumes of stories by the late Constance 
Fenimore Woolson have been added to the consid- 
erable list of books bearing her name. The six 
stories of the one volume and the five of the other 
all relate to Italy, where the writer spent the clos- 
ing part of her life. But, although the scenes are 
Italian, the characters are for the most part ex- 
patriated Americans, who speak and act very much 
as they would have done at home, except that they 
have more interesting things to do and talk about. 
Most of these stories are swift character-studies, 
filled with much animated chatter of the sort that 
passes for conversation in our feverish modern so- 
ciety, and only now and then are the springs of life 
for a moment touched. They are finished work, 
and consequently satisfactory in a way, despite their 
limitations. Two or three of them display consid- 
erable inventive skill, while others have fine-spun 
analysis as their chief element. Perhaps the most 
striking of all is the story of " The Front Yard," 
with its simple pathos and its wholly original con- 
ception. All of the stories have had previous pub- 
lication in the magazines.

First in order and importance among the volumes 
before us for treatment in our second article must 
be ranked the two stately volumes, entitled " Con 
stantinople " (Roberts) by Edwin A. Grosvenor, 
Professor of European History at Amherst College, 
and formerly Professor of History at Robert Col- 
lege, Constantinople. Professor Grosvenor 's book 
is a serious and scholarly work, the result of years 
of arduous labor and research ; and we include it in 
the present category only by reason of its sumptu- 
ous make-up and unusual pictorial attractions. That 
it is not, like so many books of the kind, a mere 
learned compilation, a mosaic of laborious glean- 
ings from the authorities, the warmly commenda-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



tory Introduction supplied by Gen. Lew. Wallace 
well serves to show. A necessarily hurried exam- 
ination of the work inclines us to endorse without 
qualification General Wallace's characterization of 
it as a History of Constantinople which will not 
merely serve every want of the tourist, student, and 
general reader, but be indispensable to every library 
for purposes of reference. Let us add that it is 
precisely the store-house of historical, archaeological, 
and topographical facts long needed by tourists to en- 
able them to " do " Constantinople intelligently and 
profitably, and to dispense with the greedy and pes- 
tilent horde of " guides " thrust upon the helpless 
pilgrim by the Pera landlords. The volumes are 
copiously and informingly illustrated with photo- 
graphic plates which, in point of subject, fairly beg- 
gar description portraits, views, cuts of tombs, 
buildings, bas-reliefs, antiquities, street-scenes, etc., 
following each other in bewildering variety. Sev- 
eral good maps and charts are added, and there is 
a chronological list of Emperors and Sultans, and 
a good Index. 

A graceful gift to a friend of bookish tastes 
would be a copy of Mr. W. Roberts's " The Book- 
Hunter in London," a well-made, handsome volume, 
of which Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. are the 
American publishers. The author is an authority 
on book-collecting, and his work is the first serious 
attempt, we think, to give a fairly comprehensive 
history of that fascinating pursuit, as carried on in 
the British metropolis. The work is, he says, " the 
outcome, not only of material which has been accu- 
mulating for many years past, from published and 
unpublished sources, but also of a long and pleasant 
intercourse with the leading collectors and booksel- 
lers in London, not to mention a vigorous and con- 
stant prosecution of one of the most pleasant and 
instructive of hobbies." Mr. Roberts's scholarly 
and matterful work deserves much fuller treatment 
than can be accorded it here ; and we must content 
ourselves with describing it in a general way as a 
storehouse teeming with facts and anecdotes of the 
greatest interest to collectors and amateurs, and to 
bookish people generally ; the whole being set forth 
in a very genial and agreeable style. The matter 
is conveniently arranged under such captions as : 
" Early Book-Hunting," " Book- Auctions and Sales," 
" Bookstalls and Bookstalling," " Some Book-Hunt- 
ing Localities," "Some Modern Collectors," etc. 
The humors of the subject are not neglected, and 
we need scarcely say that the Chicago collector (by 
no means such a rara avis as the author seems to 
fancy) comes in for a share of notice. Somehow, 
everyone seems to feel himself entitled to gird at 
Chicago the moment any topic germane to culture 
comes up for discussion ; and yet Mr. Warner years 
ago was far-sighted enough to predict that when 
Chicago did take hold of culture she "would make 
it hum." Mr. Roberts, however, on the authority 
of a London dealer, tells a story (largely apochry- 
phal, we dare say) of a " stylishly-dressed man " 
who walked briskly into his shop saying, as he 



pointed to a "sample lot" outside: '"I'll take 
these books ; and, say, have you any more of this 
kind with this shield onto them ? ' pointing to the 
bookplate attached, which bore the arms and name 
of a good old country family. . . . ' What 's yer fig- 
ger for them, anyway? See here, I start back to 
Chicago to-morrow, and I mean to take these books 
right back along. I 'm goin' to start a libery thar, 
and these books will just fit me, name and all. Just 
you sort out all that have that shield and name and 
send them round to the Langham at seven sharp. 
I' 11 be round to settle up ; but see, now, don't you 
send any without that name-plate, for that 's my 
name, too, and I reckon this old boss with the dag- 
gers and roosters might have been related to me 
some way.' " Just where this Chicago bibliophile 
acquired his amazing dialect will be a mystery to 
his puzzled fellow-townsmen who read the story. 
We have included Mr. Roberts's book in the pres- 
ent category largely by reason of its attractive 
make-up and its profuse illustrations, which em- 
brace a great number of portraits of noted collectors 
and dealers, cuts of famous shops and stalls, rare 
texts and title-pages, bookplates, etc. The tasteful 
cover design calls for its word of praise. 

Not a few readers will feel misgivings at the 
publication of Mr. W. Hamilton Gibson's " Our 
Edible Toad-Stools and Mushrooms, and How to 
Distinguish Them " (Harper), but examination of 
the book will show no real cause for alarm, for the 
writer has been more than necessarily timid in his 
suggestions, and sounds the danger-note so persist- 
ently and obtrusively that the wayfaring man in 
search of mushrooms for his dinner-table, though a 
fool, is not likely to err in consequence of Mr. Gib- 
son's advice. The simple fact of the matter is that 
our woods are full of delicious mushrooms of the 
edible sort ; that, although there are also noxious 
species to be found in their company, it is not a dif- 
ficult matter to make a safe selection, and that the 
knowledge by which the edible fungi may be distin- 
guished from the poisonous ones is jworth the pains 
required to master the directions given in Mr. Gib- 
son's book. Indeed, it is not fair to speak of read- 
ing such a book as a painful experience at all, for 
the author is not only an accurate scholar (as far 
as he goes), but two kinds of an artist as well 
with the pen and with the pencil or brush. His 
book is a very beautiful one, with thirty colored 
plates remarkable for truth of design and delicacy 
of tint, a still greater number of illustrations in 
black-and-white, many passages of fine descriptive 
writing, and, last but not least, an appendix of re- 
ceipts for the practical uses of the kitchen. Armed 
with the facts to be got from this book, and keeping 
it at hand for the process of verification, one may 
safely sally forth in quest of edible mushrooms, and 
as safely indulge in the epicurean delights that they 
afford. Here, at least, is a holiday book that is not 
only charming to read and look at, but is also of 
solid practical use, and hardly to be spared from 
the library of the country house.

Among gift-books combining high literary qual- 
ities with fastidious workmanship and moderate 
price, the season's publications of Mr. Thomas B. 
Mosher, Portland, Me., are deservedly conspicuous. 
Mr. Mosher's charming " Bibelot " edition of Fitz- 
Gerald's " Omar," published a year ago, will be fresh 
in the recollection of many book-lovers. The edi- 
tion was a small one, and quickly exhausted. An 
Edition definitive of this classic has now been pro- 
duced, with several new features, among them an 
intelligent sketch and appreciation of FitzGerald by 
Mr. W. Irving Way, two poems by Mr. Theodore 
Watts, and a bibliography. The text of the first 
and fourth (original) editions is given, with the 
variant readings of the other two. It will be dif- 
ficult to plan a better or more attractive presentation 
of the work than that now devised by the taste and 
judgment of Mr. Mosher. The qualities that make 
this little book so attractive are shared by Mr. 
Mosher's two additional volumes in the " Bibelot " 
series a selection from the lyrics of Rossetti, and 
Symonds's translation of the sonnets of Michel An- 
gelo. The former volume includes " The Blessed 
Damozel," "Jenny" (with some variant readings), 
the translations from Villon, the shorter ballads, 
and a score of the best-known lyrics. Mme. Dar- 
mesteter's tributary " Canzone " serves as an appro- 
priate foreword. The Michel Angelo volume has 
a frontispiece head of Vittoria Colonna, and the 
notes of the translator. Mr. Mosher opens what he 
happily calls the "Old World Series" volumes 
a trifle smaller than the " Bibelots " with a re- 
print of Mr. Lang's ever-delightful translation of 
" Aucassin and Nicolete." The original etched 
title-page is reproduced, together with Mr. Lang's 
introduction and " Ballads of Aucassin." We are 
also given Mrs. Marriott-Watson's " Ballads of Nic- 
olete " and Mr. Stedman's " Provencal Lovers," 
without which latter poem, as the editor remarks, 
" the edition would be incomplete." Last of all, 
Mr. Mosher has issued the daintiest imaginable edi- 
tion, printed on Japan vellum, of Pater's "The 
Child in the House," with the obituary sonnet by 
" Michael Field." 

In a thin oblong octavo entitled " The Quest of 
the Holy Grail," Messrs. R. H. Russell & Co. re- 
produce the series of paintings done by Mr. Edwin 
A. Abbey for the decoration of the Delivery Room 
of the Boston Public Library. The plates enable 
one at least to enjoy Mr. Abbey's fine and romantic 
conceptions, and even to form a notion of the gen- 
eral technique and rich effects of color and chiaros- 
curo of the original works. The artist has pre- 
served throughout the mystic romanticism and 
chivalric-religious symbolism of his difficult theme ; 
and the details of costume, ritual, and accesssories 
appear to be historically accurate. He has taken 
as his hero the British Sir Galahad, the Parzeval 
of the continental versions of the legend, arranging 
the sequence of adventure to suit the exigencies of 
pictorial treatment, and drawing from various poet- 
ical sources, but mainly from Robert de Borron, 



Walter Map, Wolfram of Eschenbach, and Chres- 
tien of Troyes. The five plates given (the original 
series is not yet completed) represent as many 
phases in the life of Galahad and in his quest of 
the Grail. In the first picture he is shown as an 
infant in the arms of a nun, visited in the convent 
by an angel who bears the mystic cup. The second 
represents the knighting of Galahad. The third is 
an elaborate and highly dramatic composition, show- 
ing the Knights of the Round Table seated in Ar- 
thur's Hall, the motif being the fable of the seat 
Perilous fashioned by the enchanter Merlin. The 
fourth plate shows the beginning of the Quest, the 
design representing the Knights about to set out on 
their mission; and in the fifth we see Galahad's 
" First Coming to the Castle of the Grail." The 
text gives a brief outline of the history of the Grail 
Legend, together with the artist's comments on the 
plates. 

An enticing little volume, which to see is to wish 
to handle, is Messrs. Macmillan & Co.'s collection 
of " Moral Tales " from Marmontel, in a revised 
translation and with an Introduction by Mr. George 
Saintsbury. Mr. Chris. Hammond is the illustrator, 
and the form of the volume is generally similar to 
that of the same firm's familiar green-and-gold edi- 
tions of " Cranford," " The Vicar of Wakefield," 
etc. If the reader have a literate taste and his due 
share of fancy, let him turn to this still fresh and 
fragrant garland of (in the qualitative sense espe- 
cially) eighteenth-century tales. Marmontel was a 
gifted, versatile man, whose mind was tinged with 
the peculiar doctrines and enthusiasms of his day, 
as his style was with its neo-classicalism. He was 
a true conteur, a weaver of quaint conceits and 
romantic fancies in the manner of Cre'billon the 
younger and of Marivaux ; and in these " exquisitely 
finished tales" of his, as ^Mr. Ruskin styles them, 
one may find a refreshing contrast to the dusty real- 
ism of our modern Gradgrinds, who, by some 
strange inversion of the normal order of things, 
have gotten out of their native thistle-field of re- 
porting and statistics, into the rose-garden of fiction. 
Essentially a man of his time, Marmontel's writings 
the Contes Moraux scarcely less than the me- 
moirs and treatises are saturated with its peculiar 
spirit. He was a philosophe too of the salons, 
indeed, and well below those leaders of the Eight- 
eenth Century Renaissance who sapped the citadel 
of the old intellectual and political order, and headed 
the assault upon the crowned and the cowled foes 
of light and liberty. The Contes Moraux, then, 
may be read either as tales pure and simple, or as 
documents of the period, as the reader please ; and 
from either standpoint he will be well repaid. Mr. 
Saintsbury's rather lengthy Introduction is inform- 
ing and vivaciously written, and Mr. Hammond's 
illustrations are pleasing. Another new volume in 
the charming " Cranford series " presents a collec- 
tion of Mary Russell Mitford's "Country Stories," 
illustrated by George Morrow. The tales, of course, 
are charming in style and theme, and Mr. Morrow's

pictures have quite a Hugh Thomsonish flavor 
which is commendation enough. The titles include 
" The London Visitor," Jesse Cliffe," " The Beauty 
of the Village," " Town versus Country," " Honor 
O'Callaghan," etc. 

Mr. W. D. Howells's garland of brief poems, 
" Stops of Various Quills," is issued in Holiday ap- 
parel by Messrs. Harper & Brothers, and cleverly 
illustrated by Mr. Howard Pyle. Touching the 
essentially poetic quality of the work, it cannot be 
said that the flight of Mr. Howells's muse is either 
lofty or well sustained. His numbers lack music, 
and his style lacks distinction ; but the verses are 
always thoughtful and virile, and lack of form is 
partly atoned for by pith and manifest sincerity 
of matter. There is a sombre tone throughout, 
which will be a little surprising to those who know 
only Mr. Howells's crisp and buoyant prose ; and 
it is this, perhaps, which has inspired Mr. Pyle's 
particularly dismal frontispiece. Illustration and 
decoration are finely done, for the most part, and 
not overdone which is a desideratum in books of 
the kind. 

Very pretty and dainty is Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co.'s quartet of brief romances of George Sand : 
" Francois the Waif," translated by Jane Minot 
Sedgwick ; " The Devil's Pool," translated by Jane 
Minot Sedgwick and Ellery Sedgwick ; " Fadette," 
translated by Jane Minot Sedgwick ; and " The 
Master Mosaic Workers," translated by Charlotte 
C. Johnston. The edition is limited to 750 copies, 
and each little volume, simplex munditiis, is a 
jewel of quiet, artistic book-making. Etched front- 
ispieces, Windsor hand-made paper, and the clear 
print of the De Vinne Press, complete a material 
ensemble that offers little room for cavil. The vol- 
umes, with one exception, deal with a phase of 
French life that George Sand is perhaps unexcelled 
in portraying ; and the publishers may be congrat- 
ulated on their selections. 

A unique volume of jwasi-artistic interest is Mr. 
Charles Hiatt's "Picture Posters" (Macmillan), 
being a short history of tbe illustrated placard, with 
many reproductions of choice and curious examples 
in all countries. While we cannot fully agree with 
the author as to the palaeolithic antiquity of the 
poster (the cave-dweller, he thinks, " must surely 
have possessed the essential idea of it"), the device 
is certainly obvious enough to have presented itself 
to the mind of a very primitive advertiser. There 
is in the Louvre collections a papyrus, which may 
be fairly called a poster, dating back to 146 B. C., 
and offering a reward for the apprehension of two 
slaves escaped from the city of Alexandria. Mr. 
Hiatt's illustrations embrace many photographic cuts 
of French, English, German, and American posters, 
most of them ingeniously grotesque, many in the 
unmeaningly-hideous style of Mr. Aubrey Beards- 
ley, and a few really graceful and artistic. The 
list of considerable artists who have condescended 
to this sufficiently rank form of the " pot-boiler " is 
such as to give color to Mr. Whistler's contemptu- 



ous dictum that " Art is on the town," and to the 
theory that the coming art-patron is the enterprising 
vendor of soaps and patent pills. The volume con- 
tains much curious matter, pictorial and otherwise, 
and should have a passing vogue. 

We spoke not long ago of the first two volumes- 
in Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.'s attractive re- 
issue of the art-histories of Mrs. Jameson. Three 
more volumes, now published, complete the series. 
They are as follows : " Legends of the Monastic 
Orders," " Legends of the Madonna," and " Me- 
moirs of Italian Painters." All are abundantly 
illustrated, and supplied with notes embodying the 
work of recent critical scholarship. The series of 
illustrations in the " Memoirs of Italian Painters " 
is entirely new. Miss Kuril, who has done the 
editorial work upon all these volumes, is to be con- 
gratulated upon the knowledge and taste brought 
by her to this delicate task. 

Last year Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. issued a 
handsome Edition de luxe, limited, of Dumas's 
" Three Musketeers," translated by Mr. William 
Robson, and enriched with 250 illustrations by 
Maurice Leloir, engraved on wood by J. Huyot. 
The same house now offers a far less expensive edi- 
tion of this work, which for all practical purposes 
is as good as its more luxurious predecessor, or even 
better. Leloir's work is exceedingly spirited, the 
plates are bright and clear, and altogether the vol- 
umes present a most inviting and readable appear- 
ance. 

Messrs. George Bell & Sons of London publish, 
and Messrs. Macmillan & Co. import, an interesting 
if rather desultory work on " Modern Illustration," 
put together by that undefatigable bookmaker, Mr. 
Joseph Pennell. The author observes in his pre- 
face, in his usual pleasant way, that the book is 
" but a sketch of what I think is the most import- 
ant work of this century ; from which I know I 
shall be told I have omitted almost all that I should 
have included, and inserted much that should have 
been omitted." Now we do not think that the 
" unknown or anonymous nobodies," as Mr. Pennell 
styles his critics, will be quite so hard on him as 
that comes to. His examples are undeniably well 
chosen, and, space limitations considered, repre- 
sentative ; and the only fault we have to find with 
his book on its pictorial side is that the author has 
over-modestly refrained from inserting in it speci- 
mens of his own often admirable drawings. Mr. 
Pennell at his best ranks with the first half-dozen 
illustrators of to-day ; and the fact should have 
been recognized, even in a book of his own compil- 
ing. The volume being a small one, and inclusive 
of many names, the text is necessarily little more 
than a good catalogue raisonne. It is marked, how- 
ever, with the author's usual peculiarities of style, 
including a certain snappishness and cocksureness 
qualities which have done even more than Mr. 
Pennell's inaccuracies as a chronicler and heresies 
as a critic to bring the swarm of " anonymous no- 
bodies " about his ears. Like too many artists (lit-

erary ones not excepted), Mr. Pennell ill brooks 
the rivalry of the dead ; and he has his usual quota 
of sharp things to say of past celebrities. Mr. 
Pennell's narrative, however, is lively and enter- 
taining ; and it contains a good deal of information 
as to modern French, German, English, and Amer- 
ican illustrators and their methods that the reading 
public will be glad to get, and which cannot be got 
in any other single book that we know of. The 
plates, of course, form the main attraction and real 
raison d'etre of the volume ; and of these there are 
some 140, full-page and vignette, forming a decid- 
edly interesting collection. 

Mr. Philip Gilbert Hamerton's graceful and 
thoughtful study of " Painting in France after the 
Decline of Classicism" (Roberts), illustrated with 
fourteen full-page photogravures after characteris- 
tic paintings of Aubert, Courbet, Tissot, Corot, Brun, 
Lobrichon, Landelle, and others, should find favor 
with those in quest of a sound, pictorially attrac- 
tive, and moderate-priced art-book. The plates are 
exquisite examples of process-work, and the sub- 
jects are chosen with the author's usual correct taste. 
Mr. Hamerton's essay is an altogether charming 
piece of work all in all, the best summary appre- 
preciation of the spirit and method of modern 
French art and of its representative exponents that 
we remember to have seen. The peculiarities of 
such men as Tissot, Manet, Courbet, Flandrin, and 
the rest, are brought out with a few swift and felici- 
tous touches, the justice and delicate discrimination 
of which must at once strike anyone with the slight- 
est critical knowledge of those painters. Especially 
acute are the brief remarks on Edouard Manet, the 
end and aim of whose art, Mr. H. thinks, " est sim^ 
plement la tache " la tache being perhaps the best 
rendered here as " the patch." As David used to 
teach that, in painting, the outline is everything, 
while others hold that modelling is everything, so 
our ultra-impressionist Manet may well say that la 
tache is everything. With purely technical aims, 
any subject whatever suits Edouard Manet, if only 
it presents a suitable arrangement of variously col- 
ored patches. Let the reader recall, for instance, 
one of his marvellous stubble-fields, with the long 
rows of pyramidal ricks, the whole glorified and 
empurpled by the slant rays of the westering sun, 
and the truth of Mr. Hamerton's characterization 
will appear. We regret that no example of Manet's 
work is given; though it is perhaps ill-suited to 
reproduction. The same house issues, in simpler 
style, another of Mr. Hamerton's works, " Imagin- 
ation in Landscape Painting," with twenty-seven 
illustrations after Claude, Ruysdael, Cuyp, Turner, 
Constable, and other masters to whom Nature was 
an inspiration rather than a model to be literally 
copied by the art (as some one sagaciously called 
it) "of representing objects deceptively in relief on 
a flat surface." The imaginative landscape painter 
is distinguished from the mere copyist in that he is 
interested in natural objects not, as the author well 
puts it, " for themselves alone, but because he per- 



ceives in them certain obscure analogies with the 
moods of man." This thesis Mr. Hamerton devel- 
ops, with his usual delicate analysis and wealth of 
illustration, through twenty readable chapters. The 
book should make a pretty and valuable gift for 
those who can appreciate it. While speaking of 
this work by Mr. Hamerton, we should mention 
that another attractive edition of it, at moderate 
price and with well-executed illustrations, is issued 
by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. 

Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co. issue, in two taste- 
fully ornate volumes bound in white and gold and 
encased in crimson slip-covers, the "Spain and the 
Spaniards " of that sprightly and romantic Italian 
traveller, Edmondo de Amicis. The work is newly _ 
and admirably translated by Mr. Stanley Rhoads 
Yarnall from the tenth Italian edition, and is en- 
riched with forty-seven excellent full-page photo- 
gravure plates of Spanish scenery, buildings, street 
scenes, paintings, etc. De Amicis is a delightful 
writer, and his " Spain " is one of his most delight- 
ful books still perhaps the best, and certainly the 
most brilliant and picturesque, Spanish travel-book 
extant, though very good ones have been written by 
Gautier, and by our countryman, Mr. Henry T. 
Finck. The work is one of the choicest and best 
conceived gift-books on our list. The same firm 
offers this year a revised and enlarged edition of 
that standard anthology Coates's " Fireside Encyclo- 
paedia of Poetry." The popularity of this work is 
attested by the fact that the present is the thirty- 
first edition, and the freshness of the present revi- 
sion by its inclusion of some of the recent pieces of 
Eugene Field and Mr. Riley. 

A sightly and suitable Christmas gift for a friend 
engaged in wrestling with the knotty problem of 
building a new house, or the perhaps knottier one 
of altering an old one, would be a copy of Mr. 
Louis D. Gibson's "Beautiful Houses" (Crowell), 
a sort of sequel, we take it, to his useful and prac- 
tical work on " Convenient Houses " of some months 
back. Since the publication of the latter work, Mr. 
Gibson, who is a professional architect, has been 
abroad for the purpose of studying European arch- 
itecture at first hand and in detail ; and the present 
volume is largely the outcome of his trip. It is 
partly historical and descriptive, yet essentially sug- 
gestive and practical; and the intelligent reader 
cannot fail to gather from it many valuable hints 
as to the possibility of adapting the beauties and 
merits of foreign houses to the exigencies of Ameri- 
can life and construction. Mr. Gibson, whose aes- 
thetic sense is evidently offended by the costly yet 
hideous " residences " that shock the trained eye at 
every turn in the fashionable quarters of our cities, 
has a good deal to say on the sound text that all 
buildings, however modest, may be artistic; that 
the cottage occupied by a clerk or bookkeeper who 
earns a hundred dollars a month is often a gem of 
good taste, while the " palatial abode " of the pork- 
packer or brewer who employs him is an architect- 
ural horror ; that there is no good reason, pecuniary

or other, for ugliness ; and that, in fine, the cost or 
elaborateness of a house is no measure at all of its 
beauty, save in the eye of the vulgar. The text is 
divided under the main headings : " House-Building 
an Art," "The World's Homes," "Some House 
Plans," "Materials and Details." There are a great 
many illustrations, full-page and vignette, embracing 
choice examples of foreign and American houses, 
plans, details, etc.; and these are handsomely repro- 
duced. The book forms the supplement needed by 
its extremely practical predecessor. 

Lovers of the writings of Mr. John Burroughs 
will at last have their eyes gladdened by the sight 
of a really ideal edition of his works the " New 
Riverside" (limited to 1,000 copies), in nine duo- 
decimo volumes, from the press of Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. In design, material, and finish, 
these little volumes seem to us well-nigh flawless. 
They are clearly printed from new plates, on spe- 
cial paper, and bound in the style of simple elegance 
characteristic of this firm's choice publications. Illus- 
tration and ornamentation are precisely what they 
should be thoroughly artistic and not overdone. 
They consist of etched frontispieces and engraved 
half-titles suggested by passages in Mr. Burroughs's 
works, and were designed by Messrs. Charles H. 
Woodbury, Sidney L. Smith, and W. H. W. Bick- 
nell ; and there are several etched portraits of Mr. 
Burroughs. Author, publishers, and artists are to 
be heartily congratulated on these beautiful vol- 
umes, which challenge, from cover to cover, com- 
parison with examples of the best English and Con- 
tinental book-making. 

An extremely choice and elegant three-volume 
edition, printed at the De Vinne Press and limited 
to 750 copies, of Marie-Henri Beyle's (" De Stend- 
hal's ") fine romance, ' La Chartreuse de Parme," 
translated by E. P. Robins, comes to us from Messrs. 
G. H. Richmond & Co., of New York. The con- 
noisseur of fine book-making may well linger over 
the charms of these refined and captivating little 
books. The binding, a delicate neutral tint with 
gilt stamp, is in the best taste ; the print is clear 
and open a model page ; and there are thirty 
etched plates, gems of Gallic esprit and daintiness, 
by G. Mercier, after the designs of V. Foulquier. 
" Chartreuse de Parme " is easily Beyle's master- 
piece in the department of fiction " in any case," 
said Balzac, " a wonderful production, le llvre des 
esprits distingues" Written in 1830, at Padua, 
and inspired by a chance narration of the striking 
(if not altogether laudable) adventures of the Duch- 
ess Sanseverina, it presents a vivid picture of Italian 
manners in Napoleonic times, as well as of scenes 
and events incidental to the French invasion of Italy. 
The translation of the work is easy, flowing, and 
idiomatic. 

Mr. Alfred C. Eastman has collected and illus- 
trated with considerable taste twenty-six " Poems 
of the Farm" (Lee & Shepard), from various au- 
thors Holmes, Whittier, Higginson, Madison Caw- 
em, Mary E. Wilkins, S. W. Foss, and others. Most 



of the pieces are sentimental, some are humorous ; 
and Mr. Eastman's drawings range from bits of 
rural landscape and genre, to decorations and em- 
blems indented in the text or strewn on the mar- 
gins. The effect of the whole is pleasing enough ; 
and the verses in the book appeal strongly to that 
very large class of town-dwelling Americans whose 
earliest and fondest memories are associated with 
the farm with a phase of life which, we venture 
to say, is most pleasing at a distance, like a mosaic. 
As a matter of fact, your typical American gets 
away from the farm as soon as he can, and only 
returns to it when he must. But he likes to senti- 
mentalize about it ; and Mr. Eastman's pretty book 
is a capital one to assist the process. 

All true New Englanders will appreciate the 
tasteful small -quarto volume entitled "Old Bos- 
ton " (Lee & Shepard), in which are reproduced, 
generally in satisfactory form, the fine collection of 
etchings made by Mr. Henry R. Blaney, represent- 
ing historic buildings and street scenes in the fam- 
ous capital of Yankee-land. Many of these build- 
ings are well-known landmarks, some of which still 
remain, though others have long since disappeared. 
The collection includes many fine specimens of Col- 
onial architecture, and public and private buildings 
of moi'e recent date. Among the views are the Old 
State House, Faneuil Hall, Lamb Tavern, Birth- 
place of Paul Revere, Sheafe House, Liberty Tree, 
Green Dragon Tavern, Birthplace of Cotton Mather, 
Old Boston Theatre, Old South Church, Old Prov- 
ince House, Boston in 1768, etc. Each illustration 
is accompanied by explanatory text, giving an his- 
torical account of the building represented. 

An inviting, artistic looking book, embellished 
with eleven etchings and twenty pen-and-ink sketches 
by Mr. H. Hovell Crickmore, is " Old Chester " 
one of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons' importa- 
tions. Mr. Crickmore, a native Cestrian and a cap- 
ital cicerone, is the author as well as illustrator ; 
and it is an open question in which capacity he is 
the happier. Most of the etchings-are admirably 
done, and the reproduction bears comparison with 
first-class American work. Quaint old sixteenth- 
century Chester is fast vanishing before the tooth 
of time and the vandal hand of the restorer ; and 
the past twenty years especially have wrought havoc 
with many a picturesque nook dear to artist and 
antiquary. While many an antique gem of stone 
and timber still remains, these are largely tottering 
to decay ; and, says Mr. Crickmore, " we must be 
up and doing if we would secure the semblance of 
their scarred and wrinkled features before they van- 
ish forever." It is in pursuance of this pious aim 
that he has prepared the present volume a beau- 
tiful memorial of the storied remains of " Old 
Chester." 

Few persons know much about the beautiful in- 
dustrial art of fan-painting, or of its masterpieces. 
The loan exhibitions at South Kensington in 1870, 
at New York in 1882 by the Society of Decorative 
Art, and in 1891 by the Grolier Club, gave a great

impulse to the collection and decoration of fans ; 
but the opportunities of seeing these are very rare, 
the private collections in which they are treasured 
not being accessible to the public. The subject, so 
far from being a frivolous one, has a history which 
cannot be treated thoroughly without entering some- 
what into the social and artistic history of many na- 
tions. To supply such a history, and to reproduce 
some of the most interesting examples of the art, is 
the object of " A Book about Fans " (Macmillan). 
The text is highly interesting, and the illustrations in 
photogravure, twenty-nine in number, cover a great 
variety, from the old Etruscan and Chinese speci- 
mens down to the work of the moderns, Vibert, 
Leloir, Wattier, and others. From the concluding 
chapter, " Fan-Collecting," may be learned some- 
what of the encouragements and difficulties for the 
enthusiast in this field. In one way, fans are more 
puzzling than silver or china ; for they have no hall- 
mark or factory stamp, and the old ones are almost 
never signed. Yet a little study of these exquisite 
butterflies of art will give an interesting idea of 
what may be called the philosophy of style in dec- 
oration, and for such a purpose the handsome vol- 
ume just issued will serve as a valuable aid. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s new two-volume 
edition of " The Poetical Works " of John Keats 
is a very desirable exact reprint of Mr. J. Buxton 
Forman's latest edition, with its complete editorial 
apparatus of notes, appendices, etc. The Forman 
edition contains everything in the way of verse that 
Keats is known to have written ; and the present 
publishers have added an acceptable feature a 
good biographical sketch of the poet, by Mr. Nathan 
Haskell Dole. The volumes are prettily bound in 
maroon and gilt, and the text is clearly printed on 
fair paper. The edition is an inexpensive one, de- 
spite its liberal pictorial attractions, the latter em- 
bracing some excellent portraits, together with 
drawings of views suggested by Keats's poems, or 
of scenes associated with his name. Uniform with 
the above are two-volume editions, from new plates 
and with new illustrations, of Moore's " Complete 
Poetical Works " and Jane Porter's " The Scottish 
Chiefs." Price considered, these are very desirable 
editions of these standard works. 

A comely Christmas edition of "Ian Maclaren's" 
popular novel, " A Doctor of the Old School," with 
copious illustrations by Mr. F. G. Gordon, is issued 
by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Mr. Gordon's draw- 
ings are capitally done, albeit he seems to us to 
have invested the face of the good Doctor MacLure 
with an even more than Caledonian harshness of 
feature. A special preface to this edition is fur- 
nished by the author, in which he answers the often 
repeated question, " Was there ever any doctor so 
self-forgetful and so utterly Christian as William 
MacLure ? " emphatically in the affirmative : " Not 
one man, but many in Scotland and in the South 
country; I will dare prophecy also across the sea." 
The rich and tasteful binding of the volume de- 
serves special mention. 



" Literary Shrines " and " A Literary Pilgrim- 
age " (Lippincott) are the titles of two tasteful vol- 
umes in red buckram, the work of Dr. Theodore F. 
Wolfe. The former is devoted to the homes and 
haunts of American authors, the Concord group in 
particular ; while the latter treats in similar fashion 
of a number of English authors. The books are 
pleasantly written, interspersed with bits of de- 
scription and anecdote, and are inspired by a gen- 
uine, if somewhat undiscriminating, literary feeling. 
Each volume has a number of pretty illustrations. 

" One of the greatest pleasures I have known " 
is the phrase with which Mr. H. S. H. Waylen de- 
scribes the task of selecting a hundred or more 
pages of " Thoughts from the Writings of Richard 
Jefferies." Few men have known nature so inti- 
mately as Jefferies, or written of her so tenderly and 
so well. His work abounds in quotable passages 
of the deepest beauty, and it was a happy inspira- 
tion that impelled Mr. Waylen to prepare this little 
book. The volume is very prettily printed in red 
and black, and bound in covers decorated with a 
strikingly imaginative design. (Longmans.) 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. issue, in continua- 
tion of their excellent shelf edition of the romances 
of Alexandre Dumas, a new series of six volumes 
embracing "Ascanio," "The War of Women," 
Black, the Story of a Dog," and " Tales of the 
Caucasus," each a shapely, neatly bound, and well 
printed duodecimo, with an etched frontispiece by 
E. Van Muyden or Eugene Grivaz. We have had 
frequent occasion to praise these series of standard 
well-translated works, the form of which is now too 
familiar to call for special description. 

A book large enough, certainly, not to be lost sight 
of by Christmas buyers, and furnishing in its end 
less profusion of illustrations and general mechan 
ical excellence, combined with substantial contents, 
sufficient claim to be regarded as a gift-book par 
excellence, is the new edition of " Webster's Inter- 
national Dictionary " (G. & C. Merriam Co.) The 
fortunate young man or woman who receives this 
noble work will possess a copy of what is perhaps 
the most remarkable single volume in the world, 
and one that in itself may be made the foundation 
of an education ; while scholars and literary workers 
find that, whatever other dictionaries they may 
possess, the " International " has special merits of 
its own that make its presence a necessity in every 
well-ordered library. 

A generous royal octavo compiled by Mr. Will- 
iam Ellis Scull and published by Messrs. John C. 
Winston & Co., Philadelphia, presents a copiously 
illustrated sheaf of descriptions of " Westminster 
Abbey and the Cathedrals of England," from the 
writings of Deans Farrar, Milman, Stanley, and 
other authorities. The pictures comprise a great 
variety of photographic views, exterior and interior, 
of the great English cathedrals and their more note- 
worthy architectural and artistic details, together 
with many interesting portraits of such leading cler- 
ical lights as Deans Stanley, Farrar, Milman, and

Church, Canon Liddon, Archbishops Tait, Benson, 
Magee, and Maclagan, Bishops Lightf oot, Westcott, 
Woodworth, Wilberforce, etc. The plates are fine 
examples of the capabilities of the half-tone process ; 
and altogether the equipment of the work is remark- 
ably good, in view of the modest price asked for it. 

A thin quarto volume of a somewhat " churchly " 
flavor, bearing the non-committal title " Crowns " 
(A. S. Barnes & Co.), is a work that almost defies 
definite description. Each left-hand page presents 
a text containing some allusion to a crown ; while 
on the opposite page is a picture presumably sug- 
gested by and illustrative of the text. For instance, 
a portrait of Mr. Gladstone (at least we take it to be 
such from the collar) faces the verse, " The hoary 
head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way 
of righteousness"; while the text: "Now they do it 
to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorrupt- 
ible," is mysteriously coupled with a cut of an " up 
to date " young woman playing the violin. Several 
of the pictures, taken by themselves, are rather 
nicely done ; and it is only fair to say of the artist, 
Miss Blanche McManus, that she was almost hope- 
lessly handicapped at the start by the nature of the 
work cut out for her. 

An admirable little volume containing Shake- 
speare's " A Midsummer Night's Dream," specially 
prepared for the use of young readers, comes from 
the Dent press of London (Macmillan). It is pro- 
fusely and artistically illustrated by Robert Anning 
Bell ; and Israel Gollancz has supplied a rather 
lengthy but pleasantly written Introduction (in the 
form of a letter) discussing the play and its author, 
and dipping lightly into the complex subject of En- 
glish fairy-lore. There is a helpful glossary. 

Two pretty and inexpensive books from Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. are " L' Avril," M. Paul Mar- 
gueritte's charming tale of Southern France, and 
Champfleury's classic " The Faience Violin," both 
translated by Helen B. Dole. The illustrations of 
the former volume are from the author's own de- 
signs ; while the latter contains reproductions of the 
still-life etchings made by M. Jules Adeline for 
Conquet's fine limited edition. The books are made 
up in the tasteful style of the " Faience Library." 

" On Winds of Fancy Blown " (Lee & Shepard), 
a thin octavo volume of the once conventional 
" Christmas book " order, contains some pretty, if 
amateurish, verses and decorative drawings by Mary 
Yale Shapleigh. Text and pictures are printed in 
a delicate neutral tint on rather thick glazed paper ; 
and the whole is encased in a chaste cover of light 
green, with gold lettering and a tasteful thistle de- 
sign stamped in green of a darker tint. 

Mr. Ruskin's protean " Sesame and Lilies " ap- 
pears in still another form, this time in that of 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons' thoroughly artistic 
"Elia Series." The volume contains the preface 
to the original edition, and also the one written by 
Mr. Ruskin in 1871. It is clearly printed on deckel- 
edge paper, and bound in full, umber-colored ooze 
calf ; and altogether we do not recall a prettier 



handy edition of this sweet and suggestive book. 

The benighted souls who have not read M. Dau- 
det's " Tartarin of Tarascon " will do well to pro- 
cure without delay a copy of Messrs. T. Y. Crowell 
& Co.'s pretty and convenient edition of that rollick- 
ing work. The translation is an excellent one, and 
the artist has succeeded very well in delineating the 
whims and humors of the good Provencal Quixote 
or Sancho Panza, one scarcely knows which. The 
volume is nicely bound in green and gold, and looks 
as if it were worth double the money asked for it. 

A tempting little book in a showy binding of 
crimson and gold is " Old- World Japan " (Macmil- 
lan), a collection of twenty Japanese folk-tales re- 
told by Mr. Frank Rinder and tastefully illustrated 
by Mr. F. H. Robinson. The author has made his 
selections with a view rather to their inherent charm 
and beauty as stories, than to their interest from 
the f olk-lorist's standpoint ; and he has re-worded 
them nicely. The volume makes an exceedingly 
pretty gift-book for young readers. 

" Broken Notes from a Gray Nunnery " ( Lee & 
Shepard), by Julia Sherman Hallock, is the not 
very luminous title of a vague little booklet con- 
taining, apparently, the year's journal little day- 
to-day jottings from January to January, as to the 
changing seasons, the birds, plants, etc., and the 
writer's moods and fancies of a lady (dare we 
guess, a maiden lady?) who lives in the country. 
Some of the entries display a vein of pleasing senti- 
ment ; and the little sprays of flowers, leaves, etc., 
strewn through the text, are nicely executed. 

The remaining holiday books, which the limita- 
tions of space force us to dismiss in a more sum- 
mary fashion than many of them deserve, include 
the following works : " The Oxford Miniature 
Scott" (Nelson), being the poems of the great nov- 
elist, printed on Oxford India paper, and filling five 
volumes, neatly boxed ; " In Friendship's Name " 
and "What Makes a Friend?" (Lamson), being 
new editions of Mr. Volney Streamer's pretty an- 
thologies ; " The Helen Jackson Year-Book " (Rob- 
erts), selected by Miss Harriet T. Perry; "The 
Whittier Year-Book " (Houghton), with a good por- 
trait " cet 78 "; " Dr. Miller's Year-Book " (Crow- 
ell), made by Dr. J. R. Miller, the author ; " The 
Spectator in London" (Macmillan), a charming 
selection from Addison and Steele, with illustrations 
by Mr. Ralph Cleaver ; " About Men : What Wo-

Porter ; a second edition of Mrs. Hellman's " Lyr-

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

II. 

It is hard to tell what the children would do without 
Mr. Andrew Lang's contributions to their entertainment. 
Much as he writes for their elders, he never forgets the 
little people, and as regularly as Christmas comes round 
he sends them a literary gift. This year he sends two, 
so that all tastes may be satisfied. " The Red True 
Story Book " (Longmans) seems the more interesting 
to one of the untutored elders, whose travels no longer 
take him into fairyland; although there will doubtless 
be plenty of boys and girls to disagree with such a judg- 
ment. To these the realm of Prince Prigio will be far 
more real than the South Africa of to-day or the France 
of the fifteenth century ; truth is so much stranger than 
fiction, and these tales of heroism and self-sacrifice are 
so much more romantic than any manufactured stories. 
What could be more splendid, more thrilling, than this 
story of " Wilson's Last Fight," as told here by Mr. 
Rider Haggard ? The magnificent mettle of these 
men, and their brave acceptance of their fate, called 
forth from the Zulu chieftain who slaughtered them 
the tribute that " they were men who died like men, 
men whose fathers were men." This human document 
is followed by Mr. Lang's narrative of the " Life and 
Death of Joan the Maid," and the nobility of her dis- 
interested devotion to her country is vividly brought 
out. Aside from these, the stories for the most part 
are unfamiliar but eminently worthy of enduring fame. 
A few tell of heroes whose deeds are mentioned in the 
histories that children study, but without the detail that 
makes them picturesque and vivid. For the purpose of 
bringing these stories to life, Mr. Lang's compilation is 
valuable. Mr. Henry J. Ford illustrates the book with 
many spirited drawings. In " My Own Fairy Book " 
(Longmans), Mr. Lang for the first time invents his 
own fairy stories and tells them in his own way. The 
ancient kingdom of Pantouflia is his scene of action, 
and about it, he says, very little is known. " The na- 
tives speak German; but the Royal Family, as usual, 
was of foreign origin. Just as England has had Nor- 
man, Scottish, and at present a line of German mon- 
archs, so the Kings of Pantouflia are descended from 
an old Greek family, the Hypnotidse, who came to Pan- 
touflia during the Crusades. They wanted, they ex- 
plained, not to be troubled with the Crusades, which 
they thought very injudicious and tiresome. The crest 
of the royal house is a Dormouse, dormant, proper, on 
a field vert; and the motto, when translated out of the 
original Greek, means 'Anything for a Quiet Life.' 
But all this is only in the preface, which all well-regu- 
lated children will skip in order to plunge at once into 
the romantic adventures of Prince Prigio and his son 
Ricardo. The first of these gifted princes was endowed 
at his birth with many fine qualities, but the last of the 



fairies maliciously declared that he should be "too 
clever." The story of the loneliness which this gift 
brings upon him is told with so much humor and such 
delightful paradoxes that little people can easily per- 
suade their elders to read it aloud to them. In spite 
of the bad fairy, however, everything turns out happily, 
for the Prince marries a wife who is wise enough to say 
to him, " Now, could n't you take the wishing cap, and 
wish to be no cleverer than other people ? Then every- 
body would like you! " The Prince obediently consents; 
but when it comes to the point, he cannot quite make 
up his mind to the sacrifice. So, thinking that every 
man has one secret from his wife, he puts on the cap 
and says, " I wish to seem no cleverer than other peo- 
ple." And he lived happily ever after. 

A new book by the author of " Captain January " 
and " Melody " is welcome, and though this one lacks a 
little of their fine simplicity, it has still the power to 
charm. Mrs. Laura E. Richards's style is easy and 
graceful, and her character-drawing, though on broad 
lines, is good. " Nautilus " (Estes & Lauriat), with its 
gay decorative cover, is the story of a Spanish ship, 
laden with treasure of shells and sea-products, which 
sails up a New England river to the amazement of a 
quiet little town. The contrasts are effective, and the 
plot developed by them is interesting. The cuts by 
Mr. W. L. Taylor are capital "My Honey" (Rob- 
erts), by the author of " Miss Toosey's Mission," is a 
charming novel without sentimentality. It is designed 
for older girls, and the writer's knowledge of character 
and delicacy of perception make it a good thing for 
them to read. There is nothing goody-goody about the 
heroine. She is made of clay with a heart of gold ; and 
the refining and ennobling influence of the fine old man 
who develops her conquers at last her obstinacy, and 
brings out the lovely qualities of her nature. She is 
vividly alive, and the writer succeeds in making us 
believe in the essential beauty of her character. One 
could hardly judge of the nature of " Subject to Van- 
ity" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) by its title, for it contains a 
series of sketches of domestic animals. Written by 
Miss Margaret Benson, a sister of the author of " Dodo," 
it will make an attractive present to a child who is 
fond of pets. The writer understands her subjects 
thoroughly, and, what is of more importance, can make 
them entertaining to her readers. There is nothing 
dull in the little book, and the style is delightful. A 
book that belongs especially to our own country is 
" Children's Stories in American Literature," by Hen- 
rietta Christian Wright (Scribner). It contains brief 
and interesting studies of the lives and works of sixteen 
of the more prominent writers. In one way or another, 
the writer strives for picturesqueness even at the expense 
of truth. She neglects her opportunities in this respect, 
however, when she utterly ignores Poe's faults of char- 
acter, and makes him good and conventional. One 
could wish for a finer sense of truth than this indicates, 
and a greater confidence in the childish intellect. It is 
worse than useless to conceal the fact of evil from chil- 
dren, and to make gods for them of very human heroes. 
The truth is much more helpful in the end, and much 
more interesting The " Arabian Nights " are unus- 
ually popular this year, if one may judge from the fact 
that two volumes derive their stories from that source. 
One of these has already been noticed by us, and the 
second contains " Sinbad the Sailor, and Ali Baba and 
the Forty Thieves " (Scribner). The translation of Mr. 
Edward William Lane has been followed in the first,

and of the Rev. Jonathan Scott, in the second. The 
decorative drawings, by Mr. William Strang and Mr. J. 
B. Clark, are exceedingly clever, and the stories them- 
selves are always young. The nature of " Stories from 
English History " (Macmillan) is sufficiently explained 
by its title. It forms the second part of the series by 
the Rev. A. J. Church, and carries the reader from the 
time of Richard II. to that of Charles I. The period 
is full of romance, which the writer does not make the 
most of; the tales are prosaically told. But the mate- 
rial is carefully handled, and the book will give boys a 
much clearer idea of Hotspur and Jack Cade, the King- 
maker and Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh, than he can 
gain from the ordinary school history. 

The books for girls this year are not quite so numer- 
ous as those for boys, but in these modern days when 
women appropriate men's prerogatives, we cannot ex- 
pect the girls to leave tales of adventure unread. 
Rightly speaking, all books for the young are for both 
sexes and it is only for convenience in grouping that 
they are divided. It would be a pity if girls only were 
to read the " Stories and Poems for Children " (Hough- 
ton), by Celia Thaxter, yet the book seems to belong 
primarily to them. There is a poetic delicacy about the 
tales which is charming, but makes some of them a 
trifle complicated for young readers. The first story 
is an exquisite little idyl about a " spray sprite " who 
loved the " shifting, musical, many-colored sea." The 
other tales are less fanciful, and contain much informa- 
tion about birds and insects, cleverly disguised and 
touched with color by Mrs. Thaxter's imagination. The 
verses are less poetic than the stories, and show an im- 
perfect sense of rhythm; but they are close to nature, 
and permeated with the love of birds and flowers. 
Children, however, are quickly responsive to the really 
great poetry of the world, and are given too little of it. 
One of the prettiest stories of the year is " A Child 
of Tuscany" (McClurg) by Miss Marguerite Bouvet. 
It tells of a little Italian boy, stolen in babyhood by a 
woman of the people who brought him up and loved 
him. It begins when he is six years old and tries to 
sell flowers in the city. Miss Bouvet weaves a graceful 
tale about his adventures and his strange restoration to 
his own family, one that keeps the interest throughout. 
The book is well printed and bound, but the decorative 

drawings are better than the pictures Even prettier 

in its binding and illustrations and general make-up is 
" A Last Century Maid, and Other Stories for Children " 
(Lippincott), by Miss Anne Hollingsworth Wharton. 
The stories, too, are capital, quaintly told with a touch 
of archaism that helps to carry one into the past. There 
is a glimpse of colonial life, and, by way of novelty, an 
introduction to some good and generous Indians. The 
story that one of them tells is delightfully romantic 
without being terrible, and the entire book has a cer- 
tain gentleness and peace about it. A new edition of 
" Gypsy's Cousin Joy " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), by Mrs. 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, should be welcome to all girls 
who like a fresh, wholesome, vigorous story. It is thirty 
years since the book was written, and thirty years are 
a severe test of popularity. But the girls of to-day will 
find " Gypsy " quite as attractive as their mothers did 
before them, and the work is worthy of being brought 
to their attention. The illustrations would be good if 

Miss Clark's drawing were not defective The new 

uniform edition of Mrs. Molesworth's stories is contin- 
ued by the publication of " The Carved Lions " (Mac- 
millan). The illustrations, by L. Leslie Brooke, are 



capital, and the type and paper are excellent " Oak- 

leigh " (Harper), by Ellen Douglas Deland, is an at- 
tractive story of family life, for older girls. The plot 
hinges upon the rebellion of five children against their 
father's second marriage, and their unfair struggle with 
the new mamma. The latter's gradual conquest of their 
hearts is prettily told, with a knowledge of human na- 
ture. It is a pleasure to add that the pictures by Alice 
Barbar Stephens are charming Miss Julia Magruder, 
the author of " The Princess Sonia," has done a kindly 
service for the young in selecting the " Child Sketches 
from George Eliot" (Lothrop). She has taken the 
children bodily from the great novels, adding a para- 
graph here and there to explain the situation, but leav- 
ing the extracts untouched. To Tom and Maggie Tul- 
liver the greatest space is of course given; but the Poy- 
ser children, the Garths, the little Cohens, Effie, and 
Job Tudge, are not neglected. The book will furnish 
an excellent method of interesting children in George 
Eliot and giving them a desire to read more of her work. 
Although some of the drawings are by R. B. Birch, 
they cannot be much commended; and the others, by 
Amy Brooks, are far from artistic. Mrs. Cheney's 
" Number 49 Tinkham Street " (McCiurg) is a story of 
friendship. A boy who belongs to a well-to-do family 
becomes interested in an Italian organ-grinder, and takes 
him into his heart and home. The introduction of the 
Italian boy to the Sunday-school and to the happiness of 
a quiet home is followed by a gradual softening of his 
nature and a change from boisterous and evil ways. He 
is not convincing, though, this boy of the slums; he is 
too easily turned into unfamiliar paths. The house which 
gives its name to the book is a social settlement, which 
this boyish friendship is instrumental in founding. The 
influence of the story is sweet and gentle, but the char- 
acters are too uniformly good. 

Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney has two books this year. 
One of them, " Witch Winnie at Versailles " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), follows that popular heroine through her 
studies and pleasures in the historic city named. Yet 
the book is not so much a story of Winnie as of the men 
and women who have made Versailles famous. Their 
romantic histories, interwoven with Winnie's life, make 
the book pleasantly instructive. It is illustrated with 
reproductions of famous portraits. " Paddy O'Leary 
and his Learned Pig " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a real 
story artistically told. Mrs. Champney shows herself 
appreciative of the agreeable side of the Irish charac- 
ter, its generosity, its adroitness, its wit. Paddy is a 
genuine boy, and a very clever one. His brogue is de- 
lightful, and his story is told with a rollicking humor 
which will recommend it to boys and girls alike. In 
" A Flock of Girls and Boys " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
Miss Nora Perry has published ten stories for the 
young; but there is a flavor of snobbishness about them 
that makes them harmful reading. It is not that she 
makes the snobs triumphant, rather the reverse; but 
she emphasizes class distinctions in a way that should 
never be brought to a child's attention. Social position 
and wealth are given too great importance ; and though 
the moral of the first tale is intended to be wholesome, 
it is not in the least so, as it makes the heroine succeed 
because of her possession of these advantages. The 
story leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth, and a 
desire to keep it away from the American girl. In her 
other tales, Miss Perry is somewhat more democratic. 
It would be a mistake to confine " Aunt Billy, and 
Other Sketches " (Lee & Shepard), by Miss Alyn Yates 



1895.]

Keith, to children, such insight do they show into hu- 
man nature. They are slight things, episodes, charcoal 
drawings; but they have character and are drawn with 
style. The few pages given to Aunt Billy make her 
stand out vividly before us, and the writer has a nice 
discrimination in selecting her material. The cover of 
the book is pretty. In "A Sherburne Romance" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), Miss Amanda M. Douglas has yielded to 
the requests of the admirers of her " Sherburne Series " 
to give its heroine a love story. It is pleasantly writ- 
ten, but whether such sentimentalities are good for 
young girls is hardly an open question. If they are to 
read such things at all, Thackeray and Dickens and 
George Eliot would be infinitely better. From these 
they can at least acquire some knowledge of life and 
of literature. Mr. W. O. Stoddard gives his attention 
this year to girls, and they will be grateful to him. 
" The Partners " (Lothrop) is a hearty, healthful, whole- 
souled story, which the boys will certainly not leave to 
their sisters if they once catch sight of it. Nelly is a 
breezy girl with no lack of pluck and generosity, and 
she does more than her share of work in the world with 
energy and enthusiasm. " The Mushroom Cave" (Rob- 
erts), by Miss Evelyn Raymond, combines a good deal 
of scientific information with a pleasant home story of 
a Quaker family. The characters are human and nat- 
ural, and the slight quaintness of their speech lends a 
charm to the book. It has incident enough, too, is writ- 
ten in good style, and the decorations by Victor A. 
Searles are very clever. "Girls Together" (Lippin- 
cott), by Miss Amy E. Blanchard, is what one might 
call a " talky " book. It is written almost entirely in 
dialogue, which makes it lively but does not prevent it 
from being diffuse. The English is not of the best, and 
when books for the young are sophisticated enough to 
marry off their heroes and heroines, one cannot apply 
juvenile standards to them. That kind of thing re- 
quires genius to make it acceptable to youth. And one 
does not find genius in "Cousin Mona" (Lippincott), 
by Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey. It is about a prig of 
a girl, who tells her own story and shows in detail how 
kind and self-sacrificing she is, and how narrow and 
uninteresting. Her noble scorn of the ordinary weak- 
nesses of humanity is not exactly worthy of emulation. 
But she takes care to make the moral good, and to 
show that virtue in her own disagreeable person is ade- 
quately rewarded. Miss Grace Le Baron's story of 
" Little Daughter " (Lee & Shepard) is a blithe little 
narrative of a kind-hearted girl. " Dorothy and Anton" 
(Roberts) is likewise written for small children, and 
Miss A. G. Plympton has made it a sequel to " Dear 
Daughter Dorothy." It is a charming little tale of an 
American girl in Berlin, a child who is generous with- 
out being self-conscious, and frank and natural without 
being sophisticated. She is a fresh and childish little 
creature, who awakens our interest in her friendships 
and kindnesses, and our sympathy for her ambitions. 
The illustrations are rather good. " Katharine's Yes- 
terday, and Other Christian Endeavor Stories " (Loth- 
rop), by Mrs. Grace Livingston Hill, is written for older 
girls. But there is very little human nature in these 
girls who reform suddenly and completely and change 
their ill-humor into gentleness and tolerance. They 
may be enjoyed possibly by the girls who are already 
perfect, but no other could be led by them into right- 
eousness. A book that has no touch of life in it is fruit- 
less The Elsie Books " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) are 
continued by " Elsie's Journey on Inland Waters," in 



which Miss Martha Finley describes further excursions 
of her little party through the World's Fair and over 
the great lakes. The talk is stilted, but there are as 
usual many historical narratives about places the chil- 
dren see and characters suggested by them "A Jolly 

Good Summer " (Roberts) is a continuation of a series 
by Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith. It is a pleasant home 
story of American children, who, though not unnaturally 
perfect, have good instincts and happy lives. Sophie 
May's books are familiar to many little people who have 
grown into big people since they read them; but some 
of them retain even now an affection for the names of 
Dotty Dimple and Little Prudy. The present volume 
is in the series called " Little Prudy's Children," and 
bears the title of " Kyzie Dunlee, a Golden Girl " (Lee 
& Shepard). It is a fresh, wholesome, breezy little 
story, which can be heartily recommended to all small 
girls who love to know what other small girls are do- 
ing. " The Kanter Girls " (Scribner), by Miss Mary 
L. B. Branch, is one of the prettiest of the current 
books, so attractive are Miss Helen Maitland Arm- 
strong's decorations and pictures. It is a fanciful story 
of two little girls who come into possession, through the 
intervention of a generous bluebird, of some rings 
which have the power of making them invisible. With 
these at hand they have strange adventures and go off 
on curious journeys, and the writer who tells us of them 
has skill and imagination enough to keep our interest 
awake and active. 

The books for the little folk are not numerous this 
year, but the most conspicuous of them is a picture-book 
containing " The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls " 
(Longmans). The colored cartoons were made by Flor- 
ence K. Upton and the words by Bertha Upton. The 
verses are not as rhythmical as they might be, but they 
are unimportant in comparison with the pictures. These 
are clever, relating in comical fashion the adventures 
of two Dutch dolls on Christmas Eve, the one night in 

the year when such creatures taste the joys of life 

But the pleasure the little people will take in " Little 
Miss Phoebe Gay " (Houghton), by Miss Helen Dawes 
Brown, will last much longer. It is a charmingly fresh 
little tale of a charmingly fresh little girl, and is han- 
dled by the author with a kind of sparkling gayety. 
The cleverest thing in it is perhaps the chapter where 
little Miss Phoebe Gay pretends to be ill in order to 
escape learning the names of the rivers in China, with 
the result that they are forever fixed in her memory. 
"There is something queer about thoughts," she re- 
flects ; " you cannot have a good time with them if you 
have done anything naughty. I do not say that I had 
been naughty, but I do say that my thoughts that 
morning behaved as if I had been." The cover and 

pictures by Mr. S. J. F. Johnston are capital A 

pretty book is "Dear Little Marchioness" (Crowell). 
It is a story of the yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, 
written by one who ministered to the sick during that 
terrible time. The horror, however, is only suggested, 
and the effect in spite of it is of gentleness and peace. 
The old darkey is a good bit of character-drawing on 

broad lines There is character, too, in " The Young 

Pretenders" (Longmans), by Miss Edith Henrietta 
Fowler. These children are not puppets, set up to be 
shifted about and made to gesticulate at the whimsical 
will of the author. They have an independent life of 
their own, and their emotions are not always cut and 
dried to order. They are delightfully mischievous, and 
"Babs" is a veritable fascinator "Young Master

[Dec. 16, 



Kirke " (Lee & Shepard) is by Miss Penn Shirley, the 
author of " Little Miss Weezy," and that popular 
maiden appears again in these pages. The little family 
is taken down to Mexico, and the writer gives one too 
slight a glimpse of that picturesque country. " Frow- 
zle the Runaway " (Roberts), by Miss Lily F. Wessel- 
hoeft, is described on the title-page as a fable for chil- 
dren; but it is merely a pleasant, wholesome story, which 
takes a dog for a hero, wisely enough, too, for dogs 
are so often more heroic than boys. Messrs. Roberts 
publish three little books by Miss M. Carrie Hyde, 
which are cleverly illustrated by Mr. Victor A. Searles. 
" Under the Stable Floor " is a romance of the rat king- 
dom; "Goostie " of a pathetic little waif of humanity; 
and " Yan and Nochie of Tappan Sea " tells the story of 
some Dutch children who were transplanted to this 
country early in the century. Miss Hyde's style is 
good, and she knows so well how to evolve an enter- 
taining story that children will welcome her into their 
kingdom. 

In spite of the many books for boys mentioned in our 
previous number, a few must still be added to the list. 
A profitless undertaking was that of Mr. Elbridge S. 
Brooks in searching out " Great Men's Sons " (Putnam) 
and writing their lives. It is almost always a disap- 
pointment to learn of the sons of distinguished men, so 
rarely have they done anything worth recording. Mr. 
Brooks's style is light and even gay, but one feels all 
the time that he is making an effort to be bright and 
picturesque. With these subjects he has some difficulty 
in compassing it. The book is well and abundantly 
illustrated, and carries one from Socrates to Napoleon. 
The children are indulged with a share of the cur- 
rent fads, and therefore they are presented with " The 
Boy Life of Napoleon " (Lothrop), adapted and enlarged 
from the French of Madame Eugenie Foa. The sub- 
ject could not well be more interesting, for there is 
much in the story of the Conqueror's youth that sug- 
gests his later triumphs. And if Mme. Foa has enlarged 
a little upon the truth, she has not perverted it, and she 
has made a readable narrative Captain Charles King, 
U.S.A., knows how to make an entertaining story, and 
the boys will be glad that he has turned his attention 
to them. " Trooper Ross and Signal Butte " (Lippin- 
cott) gives them two stories containing plenty of sol- 
diers, Indians, and cowboys. The first story is the 
quieter of the two, but Captain King knows his material 
and his audience, and he furnishes spirited tales. A 
second book by Mr. George Manville Fenn relates to 
the English civil war. " The Young Castellan " (Lip- 
pincott) is written chiefly in dialogue and relates en- 
tirely to adventure. A boy who likes the clash of arms 
will be absorbed in this book. " The Boy Officers of 
1812 " (Lee & Shepard) is written by Mr. Everett T. 
Tomlinson, who wishes to give his readers a conception 
of that struggle, in the belief that it will " lead to an 
increased patriotism." But the English of the book is 
so bad that even such a result does not seem worth 
while at the expense of reading it. "A Lieutenant at 
Eighteen " (Lee & Shepard) is the third of the series 
of "The Blue and the Gray, on Land," by Oliver Optic, 
and the Rebellion is an absorbing subject to boys. 
" The Knight of Liberty " (Appleton) is a tale of the 
fortunes of Lafayette, always a fascinating figure. Mr. 
Hezekiah Butterworth writes the narrative of Lafay- 
ette's young life, and his work in America, in a spirited 
manner. He leans somewhat too much, however, to- 
wards eulogy. Emigrants and axes, Indians and toma- 



hawks, are the materials with which one's blood is cur- 
dled in looking at the frontispiece of " Chumley's Post, 
a Story of the Pawnee Trail " (Lippincott), by Mr. 
William O. Stoddard. And it will give as good an 
idea as any words of the nature of this thrilling tale. 
It is necessary to add, though, that if anyone likes 

that kind of work, Mr. Stoddard does it well " The 

Young Cascarillero " (Lothrop), by Mr. Marlton Down- 
ing, takes one into Ecuador; while the second story in 
the same book, by Mr. Harry W. French, tells of the 
startling adventures of a globe-trotter "The Hobble- 
dehoy" (Lothrop), by Mrs. Belle C. Green, and "The 
Missing Pocket-Book" (Coates), by Mr. Harry Castle- 
mou, are not quite so wildly thrilling. The former is 
a good piece of work, and its hero is at the most awk- 
ward age, just between boy and man. " The Brown 
Ambassador" (Macmillan), by Mrs. Hugh Fraser, is a 
strangely contrived story most effectively told. The 
vacation of an English boy with some strange relatives 
is the basis of the action; and Donald is met at the 
station by a brown ambassador in the shape of a dachs- 
hund. This intelligent animal is so well trained that 
he speaks the English language and gives the boy a 
surprising welcome. Donald's embarrassed introduc- 
tion to the family is cleverly conceived, and his later 
experiences with man and beast have an agreeably ro- 
mantic flavor. The scene of the perilous sleep-walking 
is even poetic. But the book has rather too much of 
ghosts and intrigue to be entirely healthful for children. 
A thrilling tale of revolution in Nicaragua, by Mr. 
Herbert Hayens, is called " Under the Lone Star " (T. 
Nelson & Sous). We open the book at random upon 
the sentence, " One glance told me that escape was im- 
possible." And yet he did escape to write chapters 
with such hair-raising titles as " Unearthing a Con- 
spiracy," A Struggle for Life," " A Death-Trap," and 
" Hemmed In." These will give a sufficiently vivid 
idea of the nature of the book " The Sheik's White 
Slave " (Lovell, Coryell & Co.), by Mr. Raymond Raife, 
is of much the same calibre. But the heroes of this 
tale try to unravel the mysteries of a temple in a city 
of the desert. The extraordinary adventures which 
are the result of this effort are too impossible to be ex- 
citing Some decidedly blood-curdling pictures in- 
troduce us to " How Jack Mackenzie Won His Epau- 
lettes " (T. Nelson & Sons), by Mr. Gordon Stables, 
Surgeon of the Royal Navy. It is a story of the Crim- 
ean War, and the author declares it to be " all true, 
sadly, terribly true." There are many stories of brav- 
ery on the field; but there are also others of the courage 
necessary to patient endurance and rigorous training. 
A boy will learn from the book that other qualities are 
required for a soldier besides fearlessness in the excite- 
ment of battle. " A Lost Army " (T. Nelson & Sons), 
by Mr. Frederick Whishaw, tells of the Russians in 
Central Asia; and "Leaves from a Middy's Log" (T. 
Nelson & Sons), by Mr. Arthur Lee Knight, is quite as 
adventurous. 

There are still quieter books for boys, however, some 
that are less exciting and less feverish. But whether 
" Joel, a Boy of Galilee " (Roberts) is one of these or 
not, is hard to determine. It is certainly simpler and 
calmer, but in a different way it is quite as thrilling. 
Written by Annie Fellows Johnston, and illustrated tol- 
erably well by Victor A. Searles, it describes the expe- 
rience of a lame boy who lived in the time of Christ. 
He is himself cured by the Lord; he is in the boat when 
He stills the storm, and he witnesses others of the

miracles. He knows nothing of the Crucifixion until it 
is over, but the description of the earthquake and of his 
discovery of the crime is impressive. The story is told 
without undue emotion, but its attitude towards Christ 
is too familiar. A book dealing with the same sub- 
ject is Mary Hastings Foote's " Life of Christ for 
Young People " (Harper). But it will never be read 
by the young, so didactic and uninteresting is it, and 
so impossible for continuous reading is the form of ques- 
tion and answer which it adopts. To parents and to 
Sunday-school teachers, however, it will doubtless be 
useful, as it is accurate and carefully compiled. The 
title of " Sunday Reading for the Young " (E. & J. B. 
Young & Co.) sufficiently explains its character. It is 
a large book, containing many illustrations and stories 
and descriptions of all kinds. But a book of this kind 
may do more harm to a boy's literary taste than good 
to his heart. 

The bound volume of " Harper's Round Table " for 
1895 (Harper) is full of delightful things for boys and 
girls. It is an excellent periodical, well-written, and 
well illustrated ; and it contains wholesome food enough 
to satisfy the most exacting young appetite. Peter 
Newell's drawings alone should make it popular, so rich 
are they in originality and humor.

George Augustus Sala, who was born in 1828, died 
on the seventh of this month. He was essentially a 
journalist, and produced journalistic work of almost 



every conceivable sort from war correspondence to cook- 
books. He was also the founder of " Temple Bar," and, 
later, of the short-lived weekly, " Sala's Journal." He 
did nothing to entitle him to a place in literature, vol- 
uminous as was the output of his pen.

has for its chief feature an illustrated article upon some 
of the literary folk now living in Chicago, the work of 
Mrs. Mary J. Reid. The writer has been at consider- 
able pains to collect material for this article, and, 
although she has omitted some names that ought to have 
been included, and does not in her discussion show a 
due sense of proportion, her account is amiable, and, for 
the most part, just. 

The centenary of the birth of Thomas Carlyle was 
celebrated at his birthplace, Ecclefechan, near Dum- 
fries, Scotland, the other day. A large number of 
wreaths were sent from all parts of Great Britain and 
the Continent, one of them being presented by Emperor 
William of Germany, with the inscription: " In memory 
of the writer of the Life of Frederick the Great." A 
meeting was held at Chelsea, England, where the Car- 
lyle house in Cheyne Row, which was bought with money 
subscribed in England and America, was formally 
handed over to the trustees. Mr. John Morley pre- 
sided and made an address. 

The following note is from a recent number of the 
"Japan Mail," published at Tokio: "Mr. Miyake Yu- 
jiro, joint editor of the Nippon-jin,' has an interesting 
article on the late Oliver W. Holmes, a writer hitherto 
little studied in this country. Mr. Miyake tells his 
countrymen that in the great American poet they will 
certainly find much to enjoy and admire. He draws 
attention to a remarkable coincidence in conception and 
tone between ' The Last Leaf ' and a celebrated poem 
by the Chinese scholar Liu Ting-che. The two pieces 
are published side by side. The resemblance is really 
striking, all the more so in that the American author 
could never by any possibility have possessed a knowl- 
edge of the Chinese writer's verses." 

The Modern Language Association of America, which 
is to meet at New Haven from the 26th to the 28th of 
this month, offers an attractive programme of papers, 
among which we note : " The Conventions of the Drama," 
by Professor Brander Matthews (a paper prepared for 
the Twentieth Century Club of Chicago a year or more 
ago) ; " English as a Living Language," by Professor 
James Morgan Hart; "John Wesley's Translations of 
German Hymns," by Professor J. T. Hatfield; " The 
Comparative Study of Literature," by Professor Arthur 
R. Marsh; " Richardson and Rousseau," by Professor 
B. W. Wells; "Chaucer's Development in Rime-tech- 
nique," by Professor G. Hempl; The Italian Novella," 
by Dr. Mary A. Scott; " Troilus and Criseyde," by Pro- 
fessor Thomas R. Price; and "Fiction as a College 
Study," by Professor Bliss Perry. The large number 
of papers on the culture side of modern language study 
makes this programme noteworthy, and emphasizes a 
healthful tendency. 

We have had all sorts of wild suggestions concerning 
the appointment of a new Poet Laureate. One of the 
later and more sensible expressions of opinion on the 
subject is that made by the "Saturday Review" in 
the following terms: " The Laureateship is still unfilled, 
and there is a great deal more to be said for than 
against the abolition of an office which is really an 
awkward survival in this modern world of ours; but if 



398 



[Dec. 16, 



we must have a Laureate, there is no one better fitted 
for the post than Mr. Patmore. There are good reasons 
why Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William Morris would not 
care to accept the Laureateship, and so among the 
greater poets there is no one left except Mr. Patmore. 
It would be a graceful and a wise thing if Lord Salis- 
bury, should he decide against the abolition of the office, 
were to offer to this great religious poet and noble 
moralist an office which Mr. Patmore, a staunch Con- 
servative and lover of the old order, could accept with- 
out any loss of dignity. This would save the appoint- 
ment from the jostling and conceited crowd of minor 
poets and poetasters who are struggling for it; while it 
would mark the growth of faith and the decline of un- 
faith in our time that the author of ' The Unknown 
Eros ' should be the Laureate of a nation at heart so 
deeply religious as our own."

GRAND WINTER CRUISES 

BY THE MAGNIFICENT 

TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS 

OP THE 

HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE. 

FOR several years past the Hamburg- American Line has arranged cruises at certain seasons, 
placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces, and affording them all 
the comforts and luxuries of modern life. These cruises have become so popular with the 
American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service. 

THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin-Screw Express Steamer FURST BISMARCK, 
Captain Albers, sailing from New York January 28, 1896, to MADEIRA, the MED- 
ITERRANEAN, and the ORIENT. 

Touching at Madeira, Gibraltar, Algiers, Genoa, Villefranche (Nice), Tunis, Alexandria (Cairo 
and Pyramids), Jaffa (Jerusalem), Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Malta, Messina, Palermo, Naples, 
Genoa, and return to New York. 

The cruise from New York to the Orient and return to New York will occupy about ten weeks. Pas- 
sengers desiring to prolong their stay in Europe before returning to America may leave the excursion 
upon touching at Genoa the second time and take any one of the Hamburg-American Line's Express 
Steamers from Hamburg, Southampton, or Cherbourg, to New York, up to August 1, 1896. 

Ever since the childhood of the human race the Mediterranean coasts have played the most important 
part in the history of advancing civilization. Greece has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and 
poetry, Rome has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft, Egypt has filled our 
souls with thrills of awe and wonderment, the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig- 
ious fervor. All along the blue Mediterranean Sea we find the indelible imprints of man's past, the glo- 
rious monuments of antiquity. The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes, not in artistic 
reproduction, but in all its realistic grandeur and glory. The memories of such a trip, the sights of the 
scenery of the most remarkable events of man's history, will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every 
beholder. 

THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin-Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA, Cap- 
tain Vogelgesang, sailing from New York January 25, 1896, to the WEST INDIES 
and the SPANISH MAIN. 

The Itinerary will be: From New York and Old Point Comfort to Port au Prince (Hayti), May- 
agues (Porto Rico), St. Thomas, St. Kitts, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, 
Trinidad, La Guayra (for Caracas) and Puerto Cabello ( Venezuela), Kingston (Jamaica), Havana, 
Key West, Old Point Comfort, and New York. 

This tour lasts about four and a half weeks, and offers American tourists a most attractive and com- 
fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters. 

A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure, recalling many a famous 
exploit of dead-and-gone worthies. But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely 
palm-covered beaches, of beautiful scenery and strange peoples, offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible 
fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses. In cruising from port to port in these en- 
chanted seas, among verdant and flower-clothed islands, nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful 
mood, and life in the tropics at its best. It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine any attribute of an 
ideal winter resort not found among these " Fortunate Isles." 

CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE. 



8^ THE TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST.
