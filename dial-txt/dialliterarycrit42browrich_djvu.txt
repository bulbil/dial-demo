A CLINIC ON THE DRAMA. 



" Why have we made such a beggarly mess 
of our drama?" The question is a pertinent 
one, and Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, who first 
puts it and then attempts to find its answer, is 
an expert whose critical opinion is backed by a 
record of very substantial performance in the 
field of dramatic craftmanship, a record cover- 
ing a quarter-century of industrious activity. 
Mr. Jones, who recently visited this country, 
took occasion to deliver himself of certain views 
concerning the art which he represents, views 
which were primarily offered to academic au- 
diences at Harvard and Yale and are now being 
circulated in printed form among the larger < 
American public. The Harvard address, upon 
" The Corner Stones of Modern Drama," is 
published in pamphlet form ; while the Yale 
lecture, called " Literature and the Modem 
Drama," appears in the " Atlantic Monthly" for 
December. Both are thoughtful and weighty 
deliverances, sound in their fundamental con- 
tentions and deserving of the most attentive 
consideration. 

The primary cause of our barrenness in 
dramatic production is naturally provided by 
our inheritance of puritanism. If the better 
elements of our society — or even a large pro- 
portion of these better elements — avert their 
gaze from the drama, or are filled with suspicion 
when they actually give it a share of their atten- 
tion, it becomes a matter of course that support 
of the stage and encouragemeilt of dramatic 
writing will be left to a public of lower average 
quality than would otherwise be the case. This 
lowering of the standards of taste will be notice- 
able all along the line ; it will give everywhere 
an undue advantage to the artificial over the 
natural, to the mediocre over the excellent, to 
vacuity over thought, and to vidgarity over re- 
finement. It is not too much to say, with Mr. 
Jones, — 

" We owe the imbecility and paralysis of our drama 
to-day to the insane rage of puritanism that would see 
nothing in the theatre but a horrible, unholy thing to be 
crushed and stamped out of existence. . . . The feel- 
ing of horror and fright of the theatre, engendered at 
the Restoration, is even to-day widely prevalent and 
operative among religious classes in England and Amer- 
ica. It muddles and stupefies our drama, and degrades 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



it from the rank of a fine art to the rank of a somewhat 
disreputable form of popular entertainment." 

This is surely an unwholesome condition, 
and, what is more to the* point, it is an unnat- 
ural condition for the English-speaking people. 
For our race " is naturally and instinctively a 
dramatic race ; a race of action ; a race fitted 
for great exploits on the outer and larger stage 
of the world's history, and also for great ex- 
ploits on the inner and smaller stage of the 
theatre. We have proved our mettle on both 
stages. We hold the world's prize for drama." 
And yet our estate is now so miserable that even 
the smaller European countries are justified in 
pointing the finger of scorn in our direction. 

Turning from his general arraignment to 
more specific considerations, Mr. Jones proceeds 
to conduct a clinic upon our pitiable case, and 
indicates the " symptoms and conditions " which 
seem to him the " secondary and resultant causes 
and signs " of the disease from which we suffer. 
They are, in the order of statement (which is 
also the order of their importance) the following : 
The divorce of our drama from literature, the 
absence " from modern English plays of any 
sane, consistent, and intelligible ideas about 
morality," the separation of the drama from its 
sister arts, the lack of standards and traditions, 
the want of suitable means for the training of 
actors, the star system with all its attendant 
evils, and the too great " dependence upon trans- 
lations and adaptations of foreign plays." All 
of these discouraging facts are " inextricably 
related to each other ; many of them are, indeed, 
only different aspects of the same facts ; they 
are woven all of a piece with each other, and 
with that puritan horror of the theatre which I 
believe to be the cardinal reason that neither 
England nor America has to-day an art of the 
drama at all worthy the dignity, the resources, 
and the self-respect of a great nation." We 
might discuss each count of this indictment at 
length, but this condensed diagnosis is all that 
space will allow. 

In their attitude toward the stage, Mr. Jones 
distinguishes three classes of people in the Anglo- 
American public. First, there are the mere 
seekers after amusement, " newly enfranchised 
from the prison house of puritanism, eager to 
enjoy themselves at the theatre in the easiest 
way, without traditions, without any real judg- 
ment of plays or acting." This is the largest 
class, and next to it we have the class of those 
who occasionally visit the theatre, but generally 
feel uneasy about the drama, and are " quite 
indifferent to its higher development and to its 



elevation into a fine art." The third class, a 
large one also, containing " some of the sound- 
est and best elements of the Anglo-Saxon race, 
very influential, very respectable, very much to 
be regarded, and consulted, and feared," assumes 
an attitude of active hostility to the stage and 
all connected therewith. This hostile spirit, 
imagining its motives to be of the highest, 
" everywhere sets up a current of ill-wiU and 
ill-nature toward the drama throughout the two 
entire nations ; it everywhere stimulates oppo- 
sition to the theatre ; it keeps alive prejudices 
that would otherwise have died down two hun- 
dred years ago ; and it is, in my opinion, the 
one great obstacle to the rise and development 
of a serious, dignified, national art of the drama." 
This is the spirit against which missionary effort 
should be directed, not so much in the way of 
denunciation as of appeal, for it is, after all, a 
spirit of sincerity, however mistaken in its view 
and however narrow in its knowledge. 

Such an appeal is eloquently voiced by our 
author in a lengthy passage from which the fol- 
lowing sentences may be extracted : 

" The dramatic instinct is ineradicable, inexhaustible; 
it is entwined with all the roots of our nature ; you may 
watch its incessant activity in your own children ; almost 
every moment of the day they are acting some little 
play; as we grow up and strengthen, this dramatic in- 
stinct grows up and strengthens in us; as our shadow, 
it clings to us; we cannot escape from it; we cannot 
help picturing back to ourselves some copy of this 
strange, eventful history of ours; this strange earthly 
life of ours throws everywhere around us and within 
, us reflections and re-reflections of itself; we act it over 
and over again in the chambers of imagery, and in 
dreams, and on the silent secret stage of our own soul. 
When some master dramatist takes these reflections, and 
combines them, and shapes them into a play for us, very 
Nature herself is behind him, working through him for 
our welfare. So rigidly economical, so zealously frugal 
is she, that what is at first a mere impulse to play, a mere 
impulse to masquerade and escape from life — this idle

of wisdom and beauty ; it becomes our sweet and lovable

This, then, is the use of the theatre, that men may learn 
the great rules of life and conduct in the guise of a play; 
learn them, not formally, didactically, as they learn in 
school and in church, but pleasantly, insensibly, spon- 
taneously, and oftentimes, believe me, with a more as- 
sured and lasting result in manners and conduct. . . . 
Look at the vast population of our great cities crowding 
more and more into our theatres, demanding there to be 
given some kind of representation of life, some form of 
play. . . . The effect of your absence, and your dis- 
countenance, will merely be to lower the moral and intel- 
lectual standard of the plays that will be given. Will you

test and defame their theatre, it instantly justifies their 
abuse and becomes indeed a scandal and a source of cor- 
ruption? Many of you already put Shakespeare next to 
the Bible, as the guide and inspirer of our race. Why 
then do you despise his calling, and vilify his disciples, 
and misunderstand his art? " 

These are searching questions, and the foe of 
the theatre, if he will but heed them, shoidd be 
led to an examination of his conscience that can 
hardly fail to soften inveterate prejudice and dis- 
arm hostile purpose. 

Having cleared the ground, as it were, by 
the preliminary exposition of the obstacles with 
which the drama has to contend, Mr. Jones 
proceeds to lay the corner stones of the dramatic 
edifice of the future. They are four in number. 
One is " the recognition of the drama as the 
highest and most difficult form of literature "; 
another is the dramatist's right " to deal with 
the serious problems of life, with the passions 
of men and women in the spirit of the broad, 
wise, sane, searching morality of the Bible and 
Shakespeare"; another is " the severance of the 
drama from popular entertainment " and its 
establishment as an art " in marked and eternal 
antagonism to popular entertainment "; and the 
fourth is the establishment of suitable systems 
of training for actors, and of schools (not in the 
narrow sense) for the encouragement of serious 
dramatic composition. Upon all of these sub- 
jects the author has something to say, and the 
first of them in particular, the relation of the 
drama to literature, is made the theme of the 
entire lecture delivered at Yale. " How many 
American plays," he asks, " are in active circu- 
lation among you, so that on reading them over 
you can put your finger on the fine passages 
that amused you or stirred you when you saw 
them acted ? " The question is too evidently 
ironical to call for an answer. The essence of 
the argument that follows is that our drama may 
acquire the character of literature, not by cloth- 
ing its lines in the verbal garb of imitative blank 
verse, and not by clothing its characters in the 
costumes of past ages, but by plunging into 
the pulsating life of the present, and by por- 
traying real men and women in real relations 
one with another. 

In some respects, Mr. Jones looks upon Amer- 
ica as more favorably predisposed than England 
to foster the reformed drama of the future . Since 
his return, he has unburdened himself of the im- 
pressions made by his visit in the columns of the 
London " Daily Telegraph," noting particularly 
the immense hold which the theatre has upon our 
public, and the urbane spirit of the audiences that 
throng our playhouses. With us, the theatre is 



" much more of an institution, less of an after- 
dinner entertainment " than with the English 
public. This view is flattering, but possibly a bit 
roseate. In similar strain, we read in the Har- 
vard lecture : " Your nation has, what all young- 
nations have, what England is losing, the power 
to be moved by ideas, and that divine resilient 
quality of youth, the power to be stirred and 
frenzied by ideals." We should like to believe 
this, and are inclined to think that there is some 
reason for such a faith. At least, we may do 
much to make it truth by taking to heart the elo- 
quent adjuration which closes this address. 

" Let your lives be fuller of meaning and purpose 
than ours have lately been; have the wisdom richly to 
endow and imceasingly to foster all the arts, and all that 
makes for majesty of life and character rather than for 
material prosperity and comfort. Especially foster and 
honour this supreme art of Shakespeare's, so much neg- 
lected and misunderstood in both countries : endow it in 
all your cities; build handsome, spacious theatres; train 
your actors : reward your dramatists, sparingly with fees, 
but lavishly with laurels; bid them dare to paint American 
life sanely, truthfully, searchingly, for you. Dare to see 
your life thus painted. Dare to let your drama ridicule 
and reprove your follies and vices and deformities. Dare 
to let it mock and whip, as well as amuse you. Dare to 
let it be a faithful mirror. Make it one of your chief 
counsellors. Set it on the siimmit of your national es- 
teem, for it will draw upwards all your national life and 
character ; upwards to higher and more worthy levels, to 
starry heights of wisdom and beauty and resolve and 
aspiration." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The serious study of fiction, so warmly advo- 
cated by Professor Phelps of Yale, is finding favor 
with many novelists of the day — or, one might 
safely affirm, with them all. Mr. Booth Tarkington 
enlarges on the benefits of such study, if devoted to 
novels of a certain type, in familiarizing the student 
with Indiana life and manners. Mr. Upton Sinclair 
is reported as declaring that novel-study will be 
required for a degree from the Jungle University, 
soon to be established at Helicon. M r. George Ada 
says a good word for the movement as one ( we will 
suppose) likely to result in a more serious study of 
college widowhood and other weighty sociological 
problems. Expectation is cherished that a student 
would gladly devote three or four times the number 
of hours to a course in modern novels that he would 
give to one in ancient language and literature, with 
a correspondingly greater intellectual quickening. 
Says Professor Phelps: "The two most beneficial 
ways to study a novel are to regard it, first, as an 
art form, and, secondly, as a manifestation of intel- 
lectual life." To this Mr. Ade adds : " But there 
are other ways. It is desirable to ascertain the 
identity of best sellers, and to study the reasons why 
they sell. The mechanism of publication should be

studied also ; as, for example, the methods of pub- 
lishers in negotiating royalties, the best methods of 
street-car and bill-board advertising, the art of 
printing on rotten paper," etc. Manifestly the great 
novel-manufacturing industry must be recognized.

The history and futility of enforced 
SPELLING-REFORM were ably discussed by Professor 
Mark H. Liddell in a recent lecture before the 
Twentieth Century Club of Boston. So-called re- 
form was undertaken as early as 1200 B. C. by 
Orm in his attempt to deVise a method of distin- 
guishing long from short vowels. Queen Elizabeth, 
among countless others possessed of more zeal than 
knowledge, tried her royal hand at revising our 
spelling. (Our own chief magistrate follows a dis- 
tinguished precedent.) In the "classic" age the 
movement halted, but received fresh impulse in the 
middle of the nineteenth century. "The current 
movement," said the lecturer; " furnishes little that 
is new, in spite of a somewhat impossible combina- 
tion of amateur enthusiasm, professional beneficence, 
and executive authority." He well urged that easy 
spelling might prove hard reading. " So many of 
our strong words being monosyllabic, of two or three 
sounds, it would be very difficult to identify them 
rapidly if they were spelled phonetically." " It is the 
eye that reads, not the ear : the value of an eye sug- 
gestion depends upon its distinction from the forms 
about it." Many other arguments were brought 
forward against spelling-reform as at present under- 
taken ; but it was not denied that reform is possible, 
even desirable, if instituted, for example, by a rightly 
constituted National Academy. Significant in con- 
nection with this whole subject, and encouraging also, 
is the recent refusal of Congress to follow the lead 
of the White House in the matter of heterography.

The old " Farmer's Almanac " is appearing at 
this new-year's season as a welcome visitor in many 
households, especially in the Eastern states. Its 
respectable antiquity and unchanging form make it 
almost an American institution. Worthy of Poor 
Richard himself are some of its maxims, as for ex- 
ample : " Every man should attend well to his own 
business ; but this does not mean that he should 
never go from home." " Economy is a virtue ; but 
there is a true and a false economy." " While the 
hay should n't be shaken out when the morning dew 
is heavy upon it, you need not lie abed for the dew 
to dry ; there is plenty to do." Obvious at a glance 
is the wider application of the following : " It used 
to be thought that anything in the shape of apples 
would do for making cider ; but if you want a first- 
class product, you must use good stock." The house- 
wife is warned that " making mince pies is a serious 
matter and not to be lightly undei-taken. All the 
materials should be of the best quality, each ingre- 
dient have its due proportion, and the aggregate be 
blended into a harmonious whole." Weather pre- 



dictions in this almanac are eminently safe and 
conservative. The likelihood of " cold, raw winds " 
in early March will be disputed by none, nor the 
probability of " a few days of fine weather " later 
on. The occm'rence of " a few warm days " toward 
the middle of May is put down as not beyond the 
bounds of reasonable expectation. The unconscious 
humor of this historic annual makes it very cheerful 
reading. ... 

Tolstoy's attempted overthrow of Shake- 
speare now attracts the attention of the literary 
world. The first instalment of this remorseless dis- 
section of Shakespeare — whereby it is intended to 
tumble him down from a usm*ped eminence — ap- 
pears in the December " Fortnightly Review," and 
consists mainly in a picking to pieces of " King Lear " 
in order to display all its absurdities, anachronisms, 
improprieties, and impossibilities. "The unquestion- 
able glory of a great genius which Shakespeare en- 
joys," declares his latest critic, " and which compels 
writers of om" time to imitate him, and readers and 
spectators to discover in him non-existent merits — 
thereby distorting their aesthetic and ethical under- 
standing — is a great evil, as is every untruth." 
With that the Russian reformer girds himself to his 
self-appointed task of rectifying error and exposing 
sham, with all the narrowness and aU the devotion 
to one idea which we expect in a prophet but hardly 
desire in a literary critic. Of course what this honest 
unbeliever in Shakespeare fails to perceive, and what 
therefore puzzles him, is that literature and life, how- 
ever closely related, are not identical ; that in litera- 
ture the ideal element enters in to color and transform 
the bald reality, else poetry (whether lyric, epic, or 
dramatic) would be impossible. That his attack on 
Shakespeare will be taken seriously is not for a mo- 
ment to be apprehended, so amusing and at the same 
time so pathetic is this misdirection of great powers. 
... 

Alcohol as a stimulus to literary produc- 
tivity is the subject of recent research prosecuted 
by Dr. F. van Vleuten, a German poet and medical 
student. In no country are the delights of wine, 
woman, and song more keenly appreciated than 
among the Teutons ; and as they are preeminently 
a writing and a wine and beer drinking people, 
their ideas on the relation of liquor to literature are 
worth considering. Out of one hundred and fifty 
leading German writers who were questioned on 
their habits and views in respect to the cup that 
cheers and also, occasionally, inebriates, one hun- 
dred and fifteen replied ; and the general nature of 
their replies is published in a Berlin literary journal. 
Ninety per cent avoid all alcoholic stimulants before 
work, but in hours of recreation find a glass of wine 
or beer refreshing and invigorating. The older men 
rather favor a moderate indulgence in drink even in 
working hours, while among the juniors total absti- 
nence is not without its followers. Herr Adolf 
Wilbrandt, the novelist and dramatist, sends in a 
laconic answer : "I drink wine, I also drink beer,

because they increase my joy of living and intensify 
my emotions ; but I never take a drop of liquor in 
any form before work." On the whole, it is en- 
couraging to note a growing tendency in Germany 
to discriedit alcohol as an aid to good brain-work. 
The cold-water poets are gaining ground.

The people who do not read books are in so 
overwhelming a majority that it is a surprise, and 
a wholesome one, to readers to be reminded now and 
then of their own insignificant minority. One sin- 
gular fact is that writers of the greatest renown may 
have the fewest readers, — as, for example, Chaucer, 
Spenser, Shakespeare, MUton. Among eminent but 
little-read living authors, a clever English critic men- 
tions Mr. Henry James and Mr. Meredith. This 
writer ( Mr. E. V. Lucas ) says : " Few names could 
stand higher than his [Mr. James's], and yet it is prob- 
able that all the readers of his last novel could be 
comfortably housed in a town no bigger than Little- 
hampton. And if Hitchin were reserved for the 
genuine readers of Mr. Meredith there would prob- 
ably still be a number of empty houses." Those who 
really do read are these : " Confirmed spinsters 
read books, studious bachelors read books, invalids 
read books ; dons and schoolmasters read books ; 
young men and women on their way to business 
read books ; school-girls and school-boys read books ; 
old-fashioned folk in the evening read books. And 
that is about all. The vast mass of persons that 
remain . . . read no books. How can they ? Life 
comes first, and after life, play, and after play, sleep. 

Books are embroidery."

The Index Expurgatorius as a book-adver- 
tiser is demonstrating its merits in these days. 
" Eve's Diary," withdrawn fi'om circulation by a 
small country library, has leaped into something 
like national fame, and is in eager demand — all 
because the artist illustrating this harmless skit of 
Mark Twain's showed a natural disinclination to de- 
part from accepted tradition as to Garden-of-Eden 
fashions. Another of the same author's works, a 
book on Christian Science, is awaited with redoubled 
interest because of the unwillingness so long felt, or 
said to have been felt, by the publishers to issue it. 
The Hohenlohe memoirs have been speedily brought 
into world prominence by the German Emperor's 
explosions of indignation and wrath at their publi- 
cation. The Kaiser blames Prince Philip von Ho- 
henlohe, the late chancellor's eldest son ; he in turn 
blames his brother Alexander; Prince Alexander 
throws the blame on Professor Curtius, the literary 
adviser ; the Professor passes it on to the publisher ; 
and the publisher — what can we suppose him to do 
but throw up his cap and shout long life to the 
Emperor? 

Baron Munchausen's prototype has been found 
by Professor Wilamowitz-MollendorfP, or, rather, the 
professor has found a number of ancient ingenious 
liars of the Munchausen stripe. One of them is Anti- 



phanes of Berge. Stephen of Byzantium says that 
"to be a man of Berge is to speak nothing true." 
(Burge, by the way, is, as Strabo tells us, " a village 
in the land of the Bisaltians as thou goest up the Stry- 
mon, distant from Amphipolis about two hundred 
stades." ) In a certain city, which is nameless, Anti- 
phanes, in the fourth centmy B.C., " heard the sounds, 
in summer, which had been frozen the previous win- 
ter." Splendidly mendacious also was Antonius 
Diogenes, who lived about the time of Alexander of 
Macedon. His " True History " is a masterpiece of 
plausible lying, though he blundered into an accidental 
verity in describing the midnight sun in Thule, a bit 
of truth inadvertently admitted also to the pages of 
Ctesias of Cnidus. One Timseus, too, and a certain 
Pytheas are said to have been adroit narrators of 
things that were not so. But, after all, there is no 
monopoly in lying, the great lies are not copyrighted, 
and hence probably the preeminence of our amiable 
Baron, who stood on the shoulders of all his prede- 
cessors. ... 

The death of Charlotte Bronti^'s husband, 
in his ninetieth year, would pass unnoticed but for 
the still-living fame of the long-dead wife. And yet 
the curate of Haworth was a remarkable man, if 
only for his half-century and more of reticence in 
regard to his illustrious better half. " I married 
Charlotte Bronte, not Currer Bell," he is reported to 
have declared when questioned about her. A recent 
writer calls him " a marvel of reticence in a garru- 
lous age." It was in 1854 that Mr. Nicholls mar- 
ried the daughter of the Rev. Patrick Brontg, after 
considerable opposition on the father's part. Upon 
her death in 1855 the widower took on himself the 
care of his father-in-law, and protected him against 
biographers too little appreciative of the old man's 
merits. The last part of his life was passed by 
Nicholls on a small estate in Ireland, where he lived 
in seclusion, an enigma to the outside world, or to 
such small fraction of it as chanced to give him a 
thought. . . . 

A novel with Shakespeare as hero, and 
entitled "A Comedy on Kronberg," has just been 
completed by Mr. Sophus Bauditz, a popular Danish 
writer of fiction. The story, which will probably 
appear in English as well as Danish, has to do with 
a company of English actors that went to Denmark 
in 1586. On the voyage one of these actors, named 
WUl, met with an accident, and on landing at Elsi- 
nore was nursed by Iver Kramme and his sister 
Christence. WhUe convalescing he read the Latin 
Chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus, and became much 
interested in the story of Prince Amlet. Christence, 
conceiving an affection for Will, and learning that 
he had a family in England, died, like Ophelia, by 
drowning. Among the characters, besides the En- 
glish actors, are Preben Gyldenstjerne and JOrgen 
Rosenkrands. Years after these events in Denmark, 
Kramme received a copy of " Hamlet " (first quarto ) 
and then first learned the identity of the man he 
had nursed.

The Travels of a Truth-Seeker.* 



Mr. Conway's "Earthward Pilgrimage" — 
his bursting of the bonds of superstition and 
supernaturalism — has proved (so most of his 
readers must think) a heavenward pilgrimage, 
a rising into regions of light and freedom, of 
breadth of view and clearness of vision. In the 
" Prolegomena " to his latest book, " My Pil- 
grimage to the Wise Men of the East," a work 
originally designed as a part of his Autobio- 
graphy, occur the following sentences, which well 
indicate the nature of the narrative : 

" Grateful am I to sit at the feet of any master, and 
nothing could give me more happiness than to find a 
master in the field to which the energies of my life have 
been given, — religion and religions. But herein my 
researches and experiences gradually developed eyes of 
my own. Whether they are strong or feeble, exact or 
inexact, they are my own organically, my only ones; 
and if they cannot weigh the full value of what they 
see, there is always the hope that others will derive 
from a truthful report some contribution to knowledge, 
— if only an example of visual perversity ! " 

Here we meet again that most engaging of 
John Stuart Mill's qualities — a willingness, an 
eagerness even, to be found in the wrong, if 
thereby the cause of truth can be served. As 
to the immediate occasion of this circumterres- 
trial voyage in quest of light, it appears that 
in 1882 Mr. Conway was invited to lecture in 
Australia, and as his South Place (London) con- 
gregation consented to give him a vacation after 
almost twenty years of faithfid service, substi- 
tutes were found to carry on his work during 
his absence, and he embarked, July 21, 1883, 
for New York, whence he continued across the 
continent and the Pacific Ocean to Honolidu, 
Australia, Ceylon, India, and thence home by 
way of Aden, Venice, and Paris, reaching Lon- 
don March 13, 1884. His search for wise men 
— .- sages who coidd answer his queries and set 
his doubts at rest — was evidently as vain as 
that of Socrates in his much more restricted 
journeyings, although he does not exactly fol- 
low the example of the son of Sophroniscus in 
asserting as much. Glimpses of the inquiring 
traveller here and there, and bits of anecdote 
and reflection from his pen, will best serve to in- 
troduce and commend his book to such as have 
not yet read it. " How many books are to be 
found," he asks, " which deal with the mental 
and moral facts of human life without prejudice

and without estimating them by some tradi- 
tional standard of authority?" Few enough, 
certainly ; but of those few the volume before 
us may fairly be counted as one. 

In the days of Professor Andrews Norton, 
and of Mr. Conway's preparatory studies for 
the pulj)it, the Harvard divinity students, who 
used a well-known text-book of Norton's, were 
wont to style his daughters the " Evidences of 
Christianity." So also Mr. Conway found in the 
beautiful ladies of the late Colonel IngersoU's 
family, evidences of the benign influence of free 
thought. Of the famous free-thinker's warm- 
heartedness and family affection, and of his at- 
tachment to Walt Whitman, our author writes : 

" On IngersoU's last visit to Walt Whitman, — to 
whom he was bountiful, — he said, « Walt, the mistake 
of your life was that you did not marry. There ought 
to be a woman here,' he added, looking around at the 
poor chaotic room. (IngersoU's address at the funeral 
of Walt Whitman was the grandest and most impressive 
utterance of that kind which I have ever heard.) One 
very intimate friend of the family told me that when- 
ever one of them applied for money, IngersoU never 
asked how much, or what it was for, but pointed to a 
drawer and said, ' There it is; help yourself.' " 

Comparatively brief is the author's account 
of his travels until he reaches Ceylon. To his 
far-eastern impressions let us therefore give the 
most of our attention. A certain highly-educated 
Singhalese gentleman had some interesting 
things to tell the stranger. 

" Mr. Perera, a highly educated Buddhist, told me 
that the story of some English authorities of Buddha's 
birth from a virgin is unknown in Ceylon. Buddha's 
mother, Maia, died some days after Buddha's death, 
and in popular belief she was born a male god. My 
expressed hope that Buddha's father had become a god- 
dess amused him. . . . My friend was a loving reader 
of Emerson, but could not at all feel the interest of our 
phUosopher in immortality. Indeed, he said that he 
thought a belief that death was entire extinction would 
be to the vast majority of the human race glad tidings. 
What he said on this matter reminded me of Shake- 
speare's thoughts as expressed by Hamlet, and also by 
the condemned youth in ' Measure for Measure.' The 
humble millions of the world fear death largely because 
they have been terrified by notions of torment after 
death, or of interminable journeyings through vile 
forms." 

A reflection with which the author closes 
one of his East-Indian chapters is noteworthy. 
After referring to the repulsiveness of certain 
clauses of the orthodox Christian creed, taken 
in their naked literalness, he concludes : 

" To those who like myself desire to preserve and 
continue all the varieties of religion in their own struc- 
tural development, it is a satisfaction to realize the 
extent to which the literalism of missionaries prevents 
their doing much real harm."

her little court of admirers at Adyar is enter- 
tainingly narrated. We quote a few passages. 

" Another person present was Mr. W. T. Brown of 
Glasgow, a young ihan of pleasant manners, who told 
me some of his marvellous experiences; but when I in- 
timated that I would like to carry away some little 
marvel of my own experience, the reply unpleasantly 
recalled vain attempts made through many years to 
witness a verifiable spiritualistic ' phenomenon.' I was 
once more put off with narratives of what had occurred 
before I came, and predictions of what might occur if I 
should come again. There was a cabinet shrine in which 
letters were deposited and swift answers received from 
the wonderful Mahatmas ; but when I proposed to write 
a note, I was informed that only a few days before the 
Mahatmas had forbidden any further cabinet corre- 
spondence. I said that was just my luck in such mat- 
ters; whenever a miracle occurs I was always too soon 
or too late to see it. My experience was that of Alice 
in the Looking-glass, — ' Jam yesterday, jam to-morrow, 
but never jam to-day. . . .' 

" She [Mme. Blavatsky] asked what was my par- 
ticular proposal or desire. I said, ' I wish to find out 
something about the strange performances attributed 
to you. I hear of your drawing teapots from under 
your chair, taking brooches out of flowers, and of other 
miracles. If such things really occur I desire to know 
it, and to give a testimony to my people in London in 
favor of Theosophy. What does it all mean ? ' She 
said with a serene smile, ' I will tell you, because you 
are a public teacher [here she added some flattery] , and 
you ought to know the truth : it is all glamour — people 
think they see what they do not see — that is the whole 
of it.' It was impossible not to admire the art of this 
confession. Mme. Blavatsky, forewarned by Professor 
John Smith of my intended investigation, had arranged 
precisely the one manoeuvre that could thwart it." 

Of course the cunning of the Indian fakirs failed 
to deceive this troublesome investigator, who, 
with persistence backed by rupees, soon arrived 
at an explanation of their mysteries. 

Passing to weightier matters, the author en- 
deavors to clear away some of our false notions 
in regard to various Oriental customs and beliefs. 
One of these erroneous impressions is that Jug- 
gernaut is a cruel god, and that self-immolation 
under the wheels of his car is acceptable to him, 
or indeed practised at all. On the contrary, Mr. 
Conway found him to be a benign and amiable 
deity, the "Lord of Life " and not of death. 
Some accident due to the pressure of a too-eager 
throng of his worshippers may have started the 
rimior of his blood-thirstiness. Another false 
notion is refuted in the following : 

" The most curious and obstinate error in Christen- 
dom is the notion that the Moslems are not Christians, 
and that Mohammed occupies the place of Christ. They 
are not only Christians, but the only ones in the East who 
maintain literally all of the miracles ascribed to Christ 
in the gospels, or relating to his birth. It is very rare 
to find among them a sceptic. " 

Then follows a remarkable conversation with 
Arabi, at that time a prisoner in Ceylon, on the 



expected reappearance of the Mahdi to over- 
throw the powers of wrong ; " and with him," 
added Arabi, " will presently appear Jesus 
Christ, who will rebuke the errors of those who 
claim to be the only Christians, and will unite 
all in the worship of one God." Asked why 
Mohammed himself shoidd not appear instead 
of Christ, he said : 

" ' Mohammed cannot appear again on earth ; he is 
dead.' ' But is not Christ similarly dead ? ' * No, 
Christ never died. There are two men who never died 
— Elias and Jesus. He who hung npon the cross was 
a mere effigy of Jesus. The crucifiers were deceived.' " 

The comparative mythology of religions inter- 
ested the author throughout his journey, and 
many instructive details were gathered together 
by him. The prosecution of his researches in Pal- 
estine was for some reason impracticable, and in 
opening his last chapter he regrets this. " My 
pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East," he 
writes, " coidd not be continued in Palestine. 
What Wise Men were there ? " And further : 

" But what I had seen and learned in Asia inspired 
me with a feeling that I had not yet come close enough 
for personal recognition to the wise man to whom 
Christendom was crying Lord, Lord, while doing the 
reverse of what he said. I had known him as the cru- 
cified, had recognized him in the oppressed slave, and 
in many a suffering cause, but my occasional tentative 
essays about the individual Jesus — the flesh-and-blood 
man — still left him a sort of figurehead. There re- 
mained then a pilgrimage to be made, and I settled 
myself down to make it on shipboard during our 
week (nearly) of quarantine. But that exploration has 
continued to the day when this volume goes to press, 
and from notes written from time to time during 
twenty years are selected those contained in this final 
chapter." 

Into these still-continuing searchings for re- 
ligious truth there is here no space to enter ; we 
must take a reluctant leave of the book. Like 
its predecessor, Mr. Conway's Autobiography, 
the work shows him in the ripeness of his 
powers, and in the enjoyment of his fearless in- 
dependence as a free-thinker, but never playing 
the part of a scoffer ; a reverent seeker, rather, 
for light and guidance, if such there be other 
than the inner light and the guidance that is, 
after all, self-guidance. His perceptions have 
lost nothing of their keenness, his hand has not 
forgot its cunning in literary craftsmanship. In 
form and appearance the book is patterned 
after the two volumes of the author's Autobi- 
ography, of which it constitutes an essential 
part. It has numerous illustrations, a photo- 
gravure frontispiece portrait of the author, 
facsimile letters addressed to him, copious foot- 
notes, and a good index.

Inside IjIght on Reconstruction.* 



The great problem which confronted the North 
at the close of the Civil War was first of all polit- 
ical, how the States that had attempted secession 
should be restored to their proper places in the 
Union. Closely connected with this was a ques- 
tion at bottom social in its nature, but designedly 
made one of politics, — the future of the slaves 
that had just been freed. The great problem 
confronting the South was primarily economic 
and social. The question of restoration to the 
Union was indeed important, but of greater mo- 
ment was the rebuilding of ruined homes and the 
proper adjustment of relations with the blacks. 
The political features of Reconstruction have 
been studied thoroughly, and have been presented 
fairly well in several cases; but it is doubtful 
if the final word has been said on the subject. 
Indeed, it cannot very well be said until the com- 
paratively neglected field of economic and social 
Reconstruction receives more adequate treatment. 
The comparative neglect of this field is not hard 
to understand. There is a certain spectacidar 
attraction about things done at Washington. 
The material for the political side of the contro- 
versy, consisting of speeches of Congressmen, 
Presidential Messages, Acts of Congress and of 
State conventions and legislatures, has been 
widely published and is easily accessible. The 
economic and social conditions, upon a knowl- 
edge of which legislative action ought always to 
be based, are often imperfectly known at the 
time and are not well described, and hence lose 
importance in the perspective. 

In view of the excellent work done by Mr. 
Edward McPherson in collecting documents on 
Reconstruction, one may naturally ask, Why 
another collection ? In the first place, McPher- 
son's has long been out of print and is now diffi- 
cult to secure. In the second place, compiling in 
the midst of the Reconstruction period, the author 
could not always distinguish the essential from 
the non-essential. And finally, the work is too 
" official," and lays too little stress upon the eco- 
nomic and social features of the case. That Dr. 
Fleming recognizes the importance of this ele- 
ment in our history is shown by the space allotted 
to it in his " Civil War and Reconstruction in 
Alabama." As might reasonably be expected, his 
collection of Reconstruction documents is note- 
worthy for the same reason. 

Most accounts of Reconstruction begin with 
the plans and theories, Lincoln's of course coming

Fleming, Ph.D. Volume I. Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark

first. The first chapter of Dr. Fleming's " Docu- 
mentary History of Reconstruction " gives some 
idea of the destruction of property incident to the 
war and of the consequent destitution among both 
whites and blacks, and also of the general temper 
of both races, all consisting of contemporaneous 
accounts by Northern as well as Southern ob- 
servers. Regarding the feeling of the Southern 
whites over the residts of the war, Northern opin- 
ion was divided at the time ; but the verdict of 
history is that they accepted defeat and all it 
meant as gracefully as coidd have been expected. 
Their economic ruin was well-nigh complete. It 
is hard to see how statesmen could ever have 
hoped to improve their feeling for the Union by 
a policy calcidated to prolong this bad condition. 
Yet surrender was followed by confiscation frauds 
and the cotton tax of five cents a pound. The lat- 
ter was believed by the New York Chamber of 
Commerce to be unjust and oppressive, and an 
appeal was made to Congress to remove it, but 
to no avail. Such a policy appears more like one 
of revenge and punishment than of conciliation. 
The so-called " Black Codes " of the South 
called forth many diatribes at the time, and no 
doubt had their influence in bringing on some 
of the harsh legislation of Congress. When one 
studies the laws, as printed by Dr. Fleming in 
connection with a statement of the conditions 
they were designed to meet, they appear far less 
outrageous than when studied through the 
speeches of Congressmen, or in Blaine's " Twenty 
Years in Congress." It is only to be regretted 
that the author did not see fit to print some of 
them in parallel columns with laws then on the 
statute-books of several New England States, 
Maine among them. A negro who lived at the 
time declared that while some of these laws 
were " diabolical and oppressive," many of them 
were passed only to deter freedmen from crime. 
In a prefatory note, Dr. Fleming speaks of 
these laws as never having been in force because 
suspended by the military authorities immedi- 
ately after their passage. In the very document 
from which we have just quoted, they are spoken 
of as being in force in Florida. However, they 
never were extensively or rigidly enforced, — 
conditions might have been better if they had 
been. 

Eighty pages of Dr. Fleming's book are 
devoted to the Freedman's Bureau and the 
Freedman's Bank, revealing the good these in- 
stitutions did and the wreck and ruin they finally 
wrought to both whites and blacks. The docu- 
ments relating to the bank, in particular, are 
interesting. At the time of its failure the de-

posits amounted to f 3,2 99,201. It was simply 
wrecked by " political jobbers, real estate pools, 
and fancy-stock sjseculators " who had no regard 
for the rights of the depositors. 

A document of interest in connection with 
the recent movement to limit the elective fran- 
chise in the South is one entitled " A Southern 
Proposal for a Fourteenth Amendment." After 
the rejection of the amendment proposed by 
Congress, there was a meeting of Southern gov- 
ernors in Washington to propose a form which 
would be acceptable to the Southern whites. It 
differs from the Fourteenth Amendment in that 
it leaves it open to the States to disfranchise on 
account of race or color, but imposes as a pen- 
alty for so doing the exclusion of the entire race 
or color so disfranchised from the basis of rep- 
resentation. 

The first volume of Dr. Fleming's collection 
of Reconstruction documents takes the story 
down "to the readmission of the States. On the 
whole, the work is very creditable to both pub- 
lisher and editor. However, one can regret that 
there were not a few more editor's notes. In 
several cases, these were really necessary to 
throw light on the dociunents used.

Music and its Votaries.* 

In art, as in literature, we are acquainted 
with the phenomenon of an age of learning suc- 
ceeding an age of genius — the original output 
of one period becoming the quarry for the crit- 
ical scholarship of the next. To this law, if it 
be a law, music offers no exception. Grieg and 
Saint-Saens are still with us as stars of magni- 
tude ; the quality of Strauss and Elgar still 
awaits final appraisal ; but on the whole, since 
the passing of Wagner, Tschaikowsky, and 
Brahms, we may be said to have entered the age 
of books about music. " Music — how it came 
to be what it is " — " What is good music ?" — 
" How to listen to music " — are slightly vary- 
ing titles of readable treatises by well-informed 
writers ; and there are dozens more like them. 
Every year the tide of books on musical subjects 
flows fuller and deeper ; and on its surface come 
to us the three volmnes included in this review. 

The musical criticisms of Mr. W. J. Hender- 
son, contributed to di fferent New York news-

papers during the past twenty-five years, have 
generally been recognized as candid, fearless, 
and intelligent. Readers have found in him a 
trustworthy guide to what was really best in the 
annual " offerings," and they will be glad to see 
this new book from his pen, addressed primarily 
to the student of singing, but furnishing very 
good reading for the finished artist and the inter- 
ested layman. However, the book is eminently 
practical ; and with a minimum of technical 
phraseology it explains to the student the prin- 
cipal physiological problems in voice-training 
and the best methods of solving- them. Yet 
vocal mechanics is only a means to an end ; and 
this end is found in Mr. Henderson's reiterated 
definition of the art of singing as " the inter- 
pretation of text by means of musical tones pro- 
duced by the human voice." In this definition 
is found the gravamen of his charge against the 
Italian school of teaching — that it made the 
production of beautifid tone the " ultimate pur- 
pose of vocal technic." Mr. Henderson has 
plenty of praise, however, for the great masters 
of teaching in Italy. He recognizes the forma- 
tive period of this art to have been the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries ; its " bloom-time," 
the eighteenth, when " technics were at their 
apogee, in the golden age of the art of singing." 
Two chapters, somewhat broader in their scope, 
may be recommended to many an alleged 
" artist." These are entitled " The Artist and 
the Public " and « The Lyric in Style." A 
short passage from the latter wiU show the 
author s trenchant method of enforcing his dis- 
tinctions. 

" Singers vie with one another in differences of style 
and interpretation. Madame Cantando sings Strauss 
after the manner of Milan, and Mademoiselle Chant 
sings Schumami according to the theory of the Boule- 
vardes, while Frau Singspiel delivers herself of " Caro 
mio ben " in the manner of Bayreuth. Each contends 
that the other is wrong. Each proclaims that hers is 
the only true authoritative style. All the world won- 
ders. No one is quite sure of anything, except that 
there are more ways of singing a song than of cooking 
a goose. The critics vainly thunder. No one pays any 
attention to them. The glorified vocalist has her little 
army of worshippers, and in the religion of musician wor- 
ship there is neither conversion nor apostasy. . . Style 
is general; interpretation is particular. Style is the 
character of a school or a master. Interpretation is the 
disclosure of an individuality. Style may embrace all 
the songs of a single composer, though it seldom does; 
but interpretation can apply to only one at a time." 

Probably few Americans are aware of the 
existence of the Worshipf id Company of Musi- 
cians in London. But its tercentenary was 
celebrated in June, 1904 ; for it was in 1604 
that its last definitive charter was granted, by

James I. The powers therein assigned of licens- 
ing persons to " use, practice, or teach the arts, 
mysteries, or occupations of music or dancing 
for lucre or gain within the City of London or 
liberties thereof " have naturally lapsed ; but 
the Company has taken an active and honorable 
part in encouraging the art in Great Britain. It 
was very sensibly decided to celebrate the anni- 
versary by a loan exhibition of musical instru- 
ments illustrative of the progress of music in 
England during the three hundred years. The 
exhibition, which lasted three weeks, was a pro- 
nounced success. Seventeen lectures were given 
by well-known artists and musical writers, with 
illustrative programmes — very much the same 
kind of entertainment that Mr. Arnold Dol- 
metsch has made so popular in this country. 
These addresses have been gathered and pub- 
lished in a handsome volume forming one of the 
" Music-Story Series," under the caption " En- 
glish Music," with a reproduction of Sir Joshua 
Reynolds's picture " The Heavenly Choir " for 
a frontispiece, and plenty of cuts of quaint old 
instruments, and facsimiles of musical scores. 
Of prime historical interest was the lecture on 
" The Evolution of the Piano-forte," by T. L. 
Southgate, tracing the development of our most 
familiar instrument from the ancient didcimer 
down to the day of Broadwood, Erard, and 
Steinway. Some Americans may hear with sur- 
prise that the tune of " The Star-spangled Ban- 
ner," like that of " Home, Sweet Home," origi- 
nated in England. In his address on " Our 
English Songs," Dr. WiUiam H. Cummings 
reminds his hearers that the words of " Home, 
Sweet Home " were written " by John Howard 
Payne, the American, and the music was com- 
posed by our London-born Henry Rowley 
Bishop, best known as Sir Henry Bishop." He 
then goes on to say : 

" I would fain dwell on this union of race, this mar- 
riage of heart and voice, and will therefore call your 
attention to a song, the product of an Englishman, which 
has, by adoption, become one of the national songs of 
our kith and kin on the other side of the Atlantic. ' The 
Star-spangled Banner,' beloved by all our brethren in 
the United States, was originally composed by John 
Stafford Smith, in London, about 1750, for a club which 
met at the ' Crown and Anchor ' tavern in the Strand. 
The club was called the ' Anacreontic,' and for its social 
gatherings the president, Ralph Tomlinson, wrote an 
ode commencing ' To Anacreon in Heaven.' This was 
first published without a composer's name, but shortly 
afterwards Smith brought out a collection of Canzonets, 
Catches and Glees, which he sold at his house, 7 War- 
wick Street, Spring Gardens. In this volume, which 
contained only compositions by himself, we find * To 
Anacreon in Heaven.' The music of the Anacreon ode 
and that of ' The Star-spangled Banner ' is the same." 



Mr. Baughan's book bearing the much-used 
title " Music and Musicians " is a collection of 
articles contributed during the past dozen years 
to various British periodicals ; some of them 
containing good and enduring work, some still 
unpurged of the haste with which they were 
originally put together. His observations range 
over the whole musical field, from " On Listen- 
ing to Music " to "Is Opera Doomed? " These 
constitute the first half of the book, under the 
head of " Random Reflections "; the rest is 
made up of more detailed criticisms on Edward 
Elgar and his " Apostles," Wagners " Ring," 
and the principal works of Richard Strauss.

Social, Sermoxs for the Times.* 

In the discussion of social subjects, the 
preacher has certain great advantages over all 
other teachers. He is sure of an audience at 
regular times, and sure of general sympathy and 
reverent hearing. There is a momentum of 
moral fervor in the spirit of the place, the hour, 
the theme. In the exposition of a sacred text 
which has a kind of authority even with the 
skeptical, the preacher can touch all aspects of 
human life. These advantages are finely illus- 
trated in the lectures, which are also sermons, 
which Dr. Charles Reynolds Brown delivered 
at Yale University. The main interest of the 
volume lies in the method by which the Biblical 
story of Exodus is made to suggest moral factors 
in the labor problems of our own time and land. 
While the audience is thinking of the ancient 
" walking delegate " who led a strike against 
Egyptian taskmasters, suddenly it finds itseH 
confronting modern instances of the same order. 

The lectures also illustrate the rigid limita- 
tions of the sermonic method of dealing with 
social questions. The audience is mixed, and 
the preacher must address the average man, not 
forgetting the young and the ignorant. The 
time is short ; the atmosphere is charged with 
emotion ; the demand for devotional effect is 
imperative ; and therefore a thorough and sys- 
tematic treatment is impossible. If the man 
in the pidpit, securely fortified against adverse 
reply, selects his illustrations of general prin- 
ciples from the conduct of his neighbors and 
hits them, they may ask for proof, or may quietly

absent themselves, or may manipulate agencies 
for securing his resignation. It is not so peril- 
ous to " damn the sins we have no mind to," 
and the wrongs of cosmopolitan oppressors ; but 
the immediate effect may be slight. All this 
points to the necessity of organizing classes of 
young men for the free discussion of social 
ethics. In such classes the general statements 
of the pulpit can be criticized freely, a wider 
range of fact can be exploited, all sides heard, 
and representatives of conflicting interests given 
an opportunity to make defense, and the min- 
ister himself will find new materials for his ex- 
hortations. The sermons in the volume under 
review would be a powerful incitement to such 
study. 

In Mr. Plantz's book on " The Church and 
the Social Problem," we follow the same theme : 
What can the Church do to promote the welfare 
of the wage-earners and further social peace ? 
There is no contribution to knowledge in the 
volume ; every fact and opinion has been worked 
over by numerous economic writers, and some 
very important elements of a large practical 
policy are not mentioned. Of this one cannot 
complain, for the title does not promise a doc- 
tor's thesis, but a practical man's counsel in the 
light of contemporary knowledge. The social 
policy must be worked out in details by spe- 
cialists, not by sermon writers. The chapter on 
Socialism does not quite fairly separate the real 
economic issue from the metaphysical and ethi- 
cal eccentricities for which many of the leading 
Socialists have stood. One can believe in col- 
lective control of the instruments of production 
without a thought of atheism. The practical 
counsels to the Church and its leaders are gen- 
erally sane, discriminating, and intelligent, and 
the plea for the thorough instruction of minis- 
ters in social science is enforced by cogent 
reasons and trustworthy authority.

Someone has thought it worth while to resuscitate 
from the " Saturday Review " of ten years ago the dra- 
matic criticisms contributed to that journal by Mr. G. B. 
Shaw. They made sparkling reading in those days, but 
that is hardly sufficient to justify the preservation of 
such current chroniclings in permanent form. We are 
not tempted to read them again, although we read every 
one of them with keen interest when it was written. But 
there are doubtless Shavians enough to provide them 
with an audience — not of the fit but few who knew these 
mad outpourings from the start — but of the gregarious 
multitude who read this author because he is the fashion 
of the day. They make two volumes, called " Dramatic 
Opinion and Essays," are prefaced by Mr. James Hune- 
ker, and published by the Messrs. Brentano. 



Recent Fiction.* 



The fictional surprise of the season is offered by 
a novel entitled " Joseph Vance," a long and delight- 
ful story cast in the form of an autobiography. The 
author is Mr. William De Morgan, said to be a man 
of advanced years, well-known in the industrial 
world besides being related to the learned author 
of " A Budget of Paradoxes," but a stranger to the 
annalist of literary affairs. Hamlet's " And there- 
fore, as a stranger, give it welcome," seems an 
approjjriate text for our reception of this singularly 
rich, mellow, and human narrative, which is gar- 
rulous in the genial sense, and as effective as it is 
unpretending. Possibly the author's frequently re- 
iterated disclaimer of literary intent may be thought 
to savor of affectation, but we cannot find it in our 
heart to say anything that has even the suggestion 
of harshness about a book that has given us so much 
pleasure. It is almost as if a new Dickens had 
swum into our ken, but a Dickens who knows how 
to curb the tendency to indulge in caricature and 
humorous exaggeration, a Dickens whose sentiment 
escapes the touch of artificiality and mawkishness. 
The autobiographer is an Englishman of the peo- 
ple, born amid humble circumstances in the early 
Victorian years, making his mark as an inventor 
and engineer by force of native talent, and display- 
ing a gift for affection and friendship that gi'eatly 
endears him to us. His story is an intensely human 
one, a story of alternating failures and successes, of 
blended joys and sorrows, artfully contrived with 
what seems like an almost total absence of artistic 
design, and holding its readers by its great variety of 
incident and characterization, its humorous flashes 
and satirical sallies, and its deep and genuine pathos. 
The pathetic note is forced almost intolerably in

the later chapters, for we are led to believe that the 
hero's sacrifice of his dearest friendship upon the 
very altar of his affections is to remain undiscovered, 
but the device of certain supplementary documents 
appended to his own life-story relieves us from the 
strain of this apprehension, and the book ends in a 
sort of glow of sunset peace. If any readers have 
fallen into the habit of taking these reviews of ours 
as a means of escape from reading the novels them- 
selves, or as a substitute for that often toilsome and 
thankless task, we m'ge them to make an exception 
to their rule in the present instance, and feel sure 
that they will be grateful for the suggestion. 

Some time ago, in reviewing a novel by Mr. W. 
B. Maxwell, a name then unfamiliar to us, we ven- 
tured the opinion, based upon internal evidence 
only, that it was the work of a woman. This seems 
to have been a mistake, but we shall never cease to 
wonder at the insight with which the author of 
" Vivien " assumed the feminine point of view. His 
new novel, " The Guarded Flame," leads to no such 
suspicion as the earlier one, but has equally remark- 
able qualities, although of a different kind. The 
central figure is that of an English philosopher, 
grown old in the service of thought, the author of 
forty or more volumes that have earned for him the 
reputation of being the profoundest of living think- 
ers. He is a man of whom no one seems able to 
speak without bated breath, and in accents which 
are a mingling of reverence and awe in about equal 
proportions. One thinks of Herbert Spencer at 
times, some of the circumstances of whose life are 
worked into the pattern, and it is more than prob- 
able tliat the author has found some of his material 
in Spencer's "Autobiography." But even the most 
extravagant laudations in which the Spencerians 
indulge seem pale in comparison with the terms in 
which Mr. Maxwell's imaginary philosopher is set 
before us. This paragon of a hero, this superhuman 
incarnation of the intellectual life, is not easy for the 
novelist to live up to ; he is " too bright and good " 
for the companionship of ordinary mortals, and 
there is a striking incongruity between his imputed 
powers and the actual words that are invented for 
his utterance. In a word, Mr. Maxwell has over- 
done his philosopher, much as the poet was overdone 
in Miss Sinclair's " The Divine Fire," and the figure 
is not made convincing. The philosopher's house- 
hold consists of three young persons, and out of 
these the tragedy of the book — for it is essentially 
a tragedy — is woven. They are his young wife, 
married to him out of gratitude before her womanly 
nature has awakened, a still younger niece who is 
practically his adopted daughter, and a brilliant 
young scholar who seryes him as secretary and as- 
sistant. Presently the niece discovers that she loves 
the secretary, and he becomes betrothed to her, 
mainly because it is the philosopher's desire. But a 
guilty love for the philosopher's wife lias been slowly 
taking possession of him, a love which is matched 
by her emotions, all the more violent because of 
their tardy development. The discharge of a Ley- 



den jar would afford an appropriate simile of what 
happens when the psychological moment arrives. 
Then the situation is made horrible by a stroke of 
paralysis that makes the philosopher helpless, and is 
followed by apoplexy, aphasia, and childishness. At 
this point the novel assumes the character of a study 
in morbid psychology, undeniably powerful, but 
almost unbearable to pursue. The girl learns of 
the infidelity of the betrothed, and ends her life 
with strychnine. The secretary departs, and ends 
his days wretchedly in a foreign country. The wife 
alone remains, to expiate her sin by devotion to her 
stricken husband during the long years which are 
needed to bring him back to activity and recollec- 
tion, and to learn in the end that he has all the time 
known and forgiven. " Tout comprendre, c'est tout 
pardonner " might be the text of this strong and 
painful story. The impressiveness with which its 
ethical teaching is enforced is the justification for 
much that seems at the time intolerable in the pre- 
sentation. The effect of the work is considerably 
marred by the frequent use of a scientific jargon 
which is not demanded by any artistic consideration. 

Readers of " The White Company " will need to be 
told nothing more of Dr. Conan Doyle's " Sir Nigel " 
than that it deals with the same period, and has the 
same hero, as the earlier romance. It is not a sequel, 
because it tells of the deeds of Nigel Loring's youth, 
and of the services which won for him his spurs. 
These services are connected with the French wars, 
for the period of the romance is from 1348 to 1356 
— from England's slow recovery from the Black 
Death to 

" The glittering horror of the steel-topped wood " 
and the glorious victory of Poictiers. Next to the 
hero, we must praise his horse, who is a most faithful 
and fearsome beast. The figures of King and Black 
Prince appear conspicuously. The author has ac- 
quired great stores of learning respecting the period 
of these two novels, and exhibits it in rather bewilder- 
ing profusion. 

Since Mr. Wells took to imagining Utopias he has 
become very tiresome. He used to spin capital yarns 
after an improved Jules Verne fashion, but his recon- 
structions of society are neither exciting nor plausi- 
ble. We particularly resent the latest of them, because 
it comes in the guise of a novel, fascinatingly called 
"In the Days of the Comet," which at once fills us 
with anticipations of the joy with which we read " The 
War of the Worlds." But we are speedily doomed 
to disappointment, for the sociological pill has only a 
thin sugar-coating of fiction, and its substance is vain 
imagining and indigestible paradox. The comet, it 
seems, causes a chemical change in the atmosphere 
which makes all mankind unconscious for a few hours, 
after which it awakes with a miraculously transformed 
character, and knows henceforth neither selfishness 
nor folly. This is the fantastic invention which the 
author exploits as a device for setting forth his 
equally fantastic social theories. He has deceived us 
by false pretenses, and we shall hereafter regard his 
books with justifiable suspicion.

Mrs. Craigie's posthumous novel, "The Dream 
and the Business," is prefaced by an " appreciation " 
of the writer from the pen of Mr. Joseph H. Choate, 
in which deserved tribute is paid to her " lightness 
and delicacy of touch," and to the " chaste and fas- 
tidious taste " which was always a controlling ele- 
ment in her work. The book itself gives us increased 
occasion to mourn the loss of this brilliant woman, 
nineteen of whose thirty-eight years were devoted 
to a literary activity that was all the time broaden- 
ing in its scope and deepening in its sympathies. 
The growth in technical artistry during these two 
decades was perhaps not so marked, for Mrs. 
Craigie knew how to write almost from the begin- 
ning, and her instinct for style seems to have been 
born with her rather than laboriously acquired. The 
new novel takes for its text the words of the 
Preacher : " For a dream cometh through the 
multitude of business." It is a study of a group of 
modern men and women, whose relations are made 
to constitute a plot of considerable interest, but whose 
chief significance is to be found in the way in which 
they mirror, from their several points of view, the 
restless striving, the feverish existence, and the in- 
stinctive groping for light which are so characteristic 
of the life of our time. Something of a catholicis- 
ing tendency is perhaps traceable, which the wi'iter's 
faith makes natural enough, but Mrs. Craigie was 
too true an artist to put religious bias into her stories, 
and her fairness in presenting views opposed to her 
own is conspicuous. To this the last of her novels 
a place must be accorded not far below that occupied 
by " Robert Orange " and " A School for Saints," 
her unquestioned masterpieces, and it is possibly a 
more remarkable production than either of those 
two in certain respects, as of its finished style, its 
economy of material, and its nice dramatic adjust- 
ments. 

"The Ladder to the Stars " gives us the fable of 
the Ugly Duckling as exemplified by a young 
Englishwoman of humble birth and provincial envi- 
ronment. The spark of genius has (after the unac- 
countable fashion of that element) been kindled in 
her soul, and it is fanned into flame by certain for- 
tunate accidents acting in conjunction with her o.wn 
persistency. She escapes from her depressing sur- 
roundings, goes to London, and achieves success as 
a writer. She nearly loses her balance through a 
temporary infatuation for an erratic foreign musi- 
cian, but shi'inks from taking the last fatal step, and 
is thus saved for the amiable young statesman for 
whom fate has really destined her all the while. 
She is an interesting figure, but hardly more so than 
some of the suspicious and vulgar persons who con- 
stitute her provincial entourage — persons whose 
varied pettiness is described for us with searching 
particularity. 

Miss Cholmondeley, after several years of waiting, 
has now given us a successor to her admirable 
novel, " Red Pottage," but we can only characterize 
the new book as a disappointment. " Prisoners Fast 
Bound in Misery and Iron " is about as preposterous 



a title as could be imagined, and the story to which 
it belongs is both thin and unreal. There is, more- 
over, much padding in the form of neat but futUe 
description and vapid philosophizing. The narrative 
deals with a young Englishman and the English wife 
of an Italian nobleman. There is a love affair be- 
tween them, the product of feeling on his part and 
of fancy on hers, but it remains an innocent com- 
plication. Unfortunately, he happens to be paying 
her a secret farewell visit at just the hour when a 
murder is being committed outside the palace, and 
the man accepts the imputation of the crime to save 
the reputation of the woman. He is sentenced to a 
long term of imprisonment, and she is contemptible 
enough to permit the sacrifice. Thus we have the 
prisoners, one " bound in iron " and the other " bound 
in misery " — the misery of such remorse as her 
shallow nature is capable of experiencing. Both 
escape from prison at last, he through the discovery 
of the assassin, and she by the confession which 
brings her relief, but the outcome is anything but 
satisfactory, for the woman gets into another senti- 
mental tangle and the man dies of a haemorrhage. 
It makes a dull and unconvincing tale that leaves 
no lasting impression. 

The reader of " The Viper of Milan " has supped 
full of horrors when he has reached the close of this 
ingenious romance. The tale is of that monster of 
iniquity, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and of his war 
with the Scaligeri and their allies. It closes fitly with 
the assassination of the tyrant, whereby the ends of 
poetic justice are attained, but this consummation is 
deferred (as history records) until the catalogue of 
his crimes has been lengthened out, and the imagin- 
ation has been given abundant opportunity to revel 
in their detail. The story makes up in action for the 
shortcomings of its style. Since it is the work of a 
young woman in her teens, it would be unreasonable 
to expect from it anything more than the lively in- 
vention and garish color with which it is well supplied. 

Mr. Crawford has been writing books for a quar- 
ter of a century, and now has about fifty volumes 
(mostly fiction) to his credit. This is an evidence of 
his industry and of the fluency of his pen, at least, 
while some of the fifty offer evidence of something 
approaching distinction in conception and treatment. 
Few would deny that his best work is that concerned 
with the social life of modern Italy, and that the 
" Saracinesca " series of novels represents the high- 
water mark of his invention, description, and analyti- 
cal powers. Little need be said of his new novel, " A 
Lady of Rome," beyond the statement that it moves 
in the social circles already depicted in many of its 
predecessors, and writes of them with the same sure- 
ness of knowledge and decorous interest of manner. 
It has perhaps rather less of plot and rather more of 
psychology than the author is wont to give us, but the 
story has both texture and strength, besides being 
thoroughly praiseworthy in its ethical implications. 
It is not often that the situation offered by a loveless 
union and an unlawful passion is handled with such 
delicacy and firmness of grasp.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



The "Affairs of State" which constitute the basis 
of Mr. Stevenson's mildly entertaining story relate 
to the succession of the Principality of Schloshold- 
Markheim. It is a case of Gulielmus contra 
mundum, for the German Emperor favors one can- 
didate, and the rest of Europe supports the other. 
Affairs approach a crisis when the allied opposition 
sends a diplomatic representative to the secluded 
Dutch watering-place where the head of the English 
foreign office is supposed to be recovering from an 
attack of influenza. In point of fact, this official is 
not. there at all, but has sent his younger brother to 
impersonate him, thus drawing, as it were, a herring 
across his trail. Now it so happens that an Amer- 
ican millionaire and his two charming daughters are 
sojourning at the same seaside resort, and the two 
young women are destined to become the dece ex 
machind in the solution of the diplomatic puzzle. 
Two courtly noblemen : two attractive and roman- 
tically-disposed young women — the outcome is 
obvious. Mr. Stevenson does not disappoint our 
expectations ; he settles the case of Schloshold- 
Markheim in the right way, and he makes four young 
persons happy. There are humorous episodes 
a-plenty, with a dash of the serious now and then, 
besides any amount of crisp dialogue. It makes a 
pleasant comedy. 

Mr. Randall Parrish has mastered the trick of 
popular narrative after a comparatively bi'ief ap- 
prenticeship to the trade, and is to-day one of the 
most effective of our story-tellers; effective, that 
is, in the way of entertainment and excitement, and 
in the. skilful management of plot and dramatic sit- 
uation, for he makes no pretense of looking beneath 
the surface of character, or of exhibiting a style of 
any significance. His list now includes two romances 
of Indian days in the old Northwest, one of the 
Civil War, and his new book, " Bob Hampton of 
Placer," which is a story of the seventies, and has 
for its climax the Sioux uprising which resulted in 
the massacre of Custer and his men on the Little 
Big Horn. The hero is a disgraced army officer 
who has become a " bad man " in the Western sense 
— a gambler, brawler, and dare-devil generally. 
He had not been guilty of the crime which was 
charged against him when he was dismissed from 
the service, but the appearances were all against 
him, and he was unable to offer anything in rebuttal 
of their damning testimony. The heroine is his 
daughter, whom he has not seen since she was a 
child, and who, grown to be a young woman, is 
rescued by him from the Indians before he has dis- 
covered her identity. That discovery made, he un- 
dertakes to provide for her, reforms himself in va- 
rious ways, and renews the effort to trace out the 
history of the crime which has ruined his reputa- 
tion. The girl is placed in refined surroundings, 
and with amazing rapidity learns the speech and 
manners of the cultivated. But all this time Bob 
does not reveal his relationship to her or tell her of his 
history. The necessity of doing so becomes urgent 
when she falls in love with a young officer who is a 



son of the man whom Bob is reputed to have killed. 
Of course, the mystery is all cleared up in the end, 
the girl marries her lover, and her fathei*, having 
cleared his name, fights gallantly with Custer and 
dies with his chief. 

" Ann Boyd " may be described as a sort of minor 
masterpiece, and easily the strongest piece of work 
that Mr. Harben has thus far produced. We have 
known him hitherto as the author of books in which 
various types of rustic Georgians entertained us by 
their quaint characteristics and the shrewd humor 
of their speech, but we have hardly thought of him 
as possessing the gifts of the construction novelist. 
" Ann Boyd," however, is a book with a well-contrived 
framework of plot to which all of its incidents and 
episodes are properly subordinated. It is, of course, 
a study of character also — and in the case of the 
woman who furnishes a name to the book a very re- 
markable piece of characterization — but the author 
keeps well in check the tendency of his imagination 
to indulge in desultory meanderings, and also holds 
himself fairly free from the control of sentimental 
impulses. 

Given, a young man who knows life as it really is, 
and a young woman who has never viewed it except 
through the smoked glasses of convention, and join 
the two in matrimony : you will then have material 
for a comedy or a tragedy, according to the degree of 
seriousness with which the situation is handled. In 
the case of " The Poet and the Parish," by Miss Mary 
Moss, there is at fii-st comedy of a very crisp and de- 
lightful sort, and then the situation develops until it 
verges closely upon tragedy, and is only saved from 
that consummation by a tonic application of common 
sense to relations that have been strained almost 
to the breaking point. The poet is Felix Gwynne, 
who has spent his youth abroad, and returns to his 
American home to enter into an inheritance. He 
is a lovable but rather irresponsible person, the 
creature of impulse, but serious enough at heart to 
engage our sympathies. The young woman whom 
he marries is distinctly bornee, and her family and 
social environment are even more so. This makes 
difficulties, especially when Felix goes wandering 
about the country with a band of gypsies, and be- 
comes entangled (innocently enough) in the affairs 
of a masquerading actress whom he meets in the 
gypsy camp. His wife, with the thoughtful aid of 
her outraged parents and most of the neighbors, 
magnifies these indiscretions into huge proportions, 
and abandons the hapless poet. It is the situation 
of "El Gran Galeoto " lowered somewhat from the 
tragic plane of the Spanish dramatist, but still seri- 
ous enough. It takes some plain speaking (or rather 
writing) on the part of Felix to bring his wife back, 
but his plea is effective. "We are mismated, but 
we are mated. . . . How can you be so cruel to that 
unlucky girl? . . . Why, the poor child hardly 

knows me, yet I'm supposed There we sat, side

there is an obstinate girl, twenty miles away, who

does n't readily break. It seems to me, at this

dear. All but one I You are real ! But in the name

One cannot feel quite comfortable in reading Miss 
Taylor's " The Impersonator," because the heroine 
(who naturally demands our sympathies) is placed 
by her own deliberate act in a position for which no 
justification is possible. A wealthy woman in Wash- 
ington has written to a niece in Paris, whom she 
has never seen, inviting her for a lengthy visit. The 
niece in question, who is dabbling in art, does not 
want to go, and asks a friend to make the visit in 
her place and character. This friend, who is beau- 
tiful and accomplished, but extremely poor, weakly 
consents to engage in this proposed deception, 
allured by the prospect of a few months of luxury. 
The main body of the story tells us of this imper- 
sonation, successfully sustained through the social 
season, and at last rudely revealed by the sudden 
appearance of the woman to whom the name really 
belongs. But the heroine has played her cards skil- 
fully, and some of her friends remain loyal after the 
exposure of the fraud. One of these is a rising 
statesman who has fallen in love with her, and who 
at last persuades her, in spite of all, to become his 
wife. This consummation is facilitated by the dis- 
covery that the young woman (whose parentage has 
hitherto been a mystery) is the legitimate daughter of 
the Spanish minister, and that she is not plain Mary 
Lang, but may claim the far more resounding name 
of Maria Fraucesca Luisa Quevedo, Countess Por- 
tucarrero. Miss Taylor's novel moves in a milieu 
with which she is well acquainted, and, barring the 
fundamental obstacle to complete sympathy, is a 
work of animated interest. 

" Montlivet," by Miss Alice Prescott Smith, is a 
romance of the old Northwest in the days when 
France was so strengthening its strategic position in 
America as to forbode stubborn resistance when the 
inevitable struggle for supremacy should come. The 
exact year is 1695, and the scene opens with Cad- 
illac in doubtful power at Michillimackinac. The 
future founder of Detroit is not, however, the hero 
of th^s story, but the French trader Montlivet, who 
has a magnificent plan for a league of the Indian 
tribes in support of the French cause. So much for 
the historical setting. The fictional romance (aside 
from the historical) is provided by an English cap- 
tive, rescued from Indian captors by the hero, and 
taken with him on his mission to the tribes in the 
neighborhood of the Bale des Puants — for thus 
pleasantly was Green Bay styled by its pioneer 
explorers. The captive turns out to be a woman in 
disguise — a woman of proud birth and spirit — and 
this the hero discovers after the expedition is well 
away into the wilderness. A variant upon the usual 



treatment of this theme is offered by their marriage 
early in the narrative, but the union is of expediency 
alone, and leaves all the wooing to be done. There 
are many exciting adventures and hairbreadth 
escapes from peril, with a suitably sentimental end- 
ing. Miss Smith has produced an exceptionally 
interesting piece of work, one which may perhaps 
be described as similar to the romances of the late 
Mrs. Catherwood with an added infusion of vu-ility. 
Mrs. Dillon insists that her new novel, " The 
Leader," is " in no sense history." Nevertheless, it 
is chiefly concerned with the history of the St. Louis 
Democratic Convention of 1904, and tells the whole 
story of the struggle between radicals and conservar 
tives, of the nomination, of Judge Parker's famous 
telegram, and of Mr. Bryan's activities. The hero 
is obviously Mr. Bryan in disguise ; that is, in just 
enough of disguise to permit him to combine love 
with politics, and thus satisfy the imperative demand 
of the reader for a love-story. Although based upon 
familiar historical happenings, the story is artificial 
in a stagey fashion, and its vein of invention is too 
thin to yield anything very rich in the way of 
romantic ore. William Morton Payne,

Incentives to a P^ofessor Albert S. Cook of Yale 
hiiiher ranf/e of University has done well to unite 
literary study, under a suggestive title four " occa- 
sional" papers on "The Higher Study of English" 
(Houghton). By the word "higher" is implied 
not merely the sort of systematic and philosophical 
research which Professor Cook has done much to 
promote in this country. Two of the essays, the 
first and the last, do indeed bear more directly 
upon graduate study and teaching. Yet the obvious 
note in all four is a general elevation of standards, 
both ethical and aesthetic, throughout the entire cur- 
riculum of English — a broadening and deepening 
of our national culture through an intensive appre- 
ciation of the best that has been handed down to us 
in literature. Higher study means study of the best 
things in the best way. The best way is not always, 
or perhaps often, the easiest, above all in the case of 
those who are to be teachers of English. For them 
the higher superstructure means the broader, deeper, 
more carefully laid foundation. Like specialists in 
other fields, they must know their subject from the 
bottom up ; they must know what is more important 
without slighting what the layman's imperfect sense 
of values may deem to be less ; and they must know 
the relations existing between their own and allied 
disciplines. They must neglect neither the origins 
of the language in which their literature is enslirined, 
nor the ancient classics and the Scriptures from 
which it has drawn its chief inspiration, nor the 
brotherhood of languages and literatures among 
which it has grown up. They must strive to com- 
pass an ever widening realm ; to rise to an ever

mounting ideal ; and nobly to despise the so-called 
limit of the attainable. Yet they must be modest, 
too, and moderate, not hoping to exercise authority 
in scholarship until they are proved faithful in atten- 
tion to detail, nor by frantic haste to win the prizes of 
equable speed. It is not sufficient, thinks Professor 
Cook, to say to the gi'aduate student, " Here is the 
body of English literature ; come and read it, and 
then go and teach it." There must be order, dis- 
cipline, regulated toil. The professional teacher 
must possess the professional orderly will. Never- 
theless, "he who has not been a passionate reader 
of good literature from the age of ten . . . and who 
does not give promise of remaining a passionate 
reader of good literature to the end of life, should 
be gently, but firmly, discouraged from entering 
our profession." With reference to this volume we 
have but one regret : we wish that the author liad 
been able to include his notable essay on " The 
Artistic Ordering of Life," which is germane enough 
to the papers here contained, in that it represents 
the final philosophy of a thinker who is also a great 
teacher of English. 

^ . ,' . It has been said that each successive 
Qarrick and . , , . 

the social life epoch of theatrical history presents 
of his tune. the Same picturesque image of sto- 

ried regret — memory incarnated in the veteran, 
ruefully vaunting the vanished glories of the past. 
Gibber, surviving in the best days of Garrick, Peg 
Woffington, and Kittie Clive, praised the days of 
Wilks and Betterton ; aged playgoers of the period 
of Edmund Kean and John Philip Kemble believed 
that the drama had been buried, never to rise again, 
with the dust of Garrick and Henderson, beneath the 
pavement of Westminster Abbey. But even to-day 
many of us still cling to the belief that Garrick was 
the greatest of English actors, while realizing that 
he is as much a centre of legend as King Arthur and 
that the ordinary Garrick story rests on a veritable 
morass. Garrick lived in an age when public and 
national life was in a condition of great flux and pro- 
gress — mirroring the decay of Jacobitism, the soften- 
ing of religious bigotry in England, and the growth 
of modern forms of political discontent. In " Garrick 
and his Circle " (Putnam), Mrs. Clement Parsons has 
embodied a true picture of the social life of the day, 
while weaving a portrait of her subject, a record of 
his triumphs and a study of his methods. In a strict 
sense, her book is not a biogi'aphy, — her aim has 
been to make each one oi a series of vignettes illus- 
trate Garrick's character or career in contact with this 
or that group of outside characters or events. She 
points out that the actor's personality is an elusive 
one. Apart from his theatric art, Garrick's vivacity 
is his individualizing label for all time ; he was born 
with such a fund of animal spirits as rarely occurs in 
association with high mental gifts. He was a genius 
with the right amount of worldly ballast for worldly 
success, and remains the ruling figure of the stage in 
eighteenth-century annals. In Burke's words, " He 
raised the character of his profession to the rank of a 



liberal art." To quote Mrs. Parsons, "There have 
been many great actors, but never another great actor 
who was at the same time so great a personality out- 
side of the theatre. Garrick belongs to the history 
of England." With vivacity, fidelity, and keen dis- 
crimination, the author has presented a study of the 
theatrical society of the period — its whimsicalities, 
vulgarities, frailities, and manners, as well as its esti- 
mable qualities. Her portraits have that fulness and 
unity which impart a conclusive notion of personality, 
set with a due sense of perspective against a well- 
balanced background. 

The inscrutable A book which undertakes to solve 
'New 'vork *^® problem of what James Parton, in 

politics. his Life of Andrew Jackson, written 

fifty years ago, described as " that most unfathom- 
able of subjects, the politics of the State of New York " 
is the Hon. D. A. Alexander's two-volume " Political 
History of the State of New York" (Holt), which 
we are told grew out of the difficulty experienced by 
the author in obtaining " an accurate knowledge of 
the movements of political parties and their leaders 
in the Empire State." Oliver Wolcott, a member of 
Washington's Cabinet and later governor of Con- 
necticut, once wrote: "After living a dozen years 
in New York, I don't pretend to comprehend their 
politics. It is a labyrinth of wheels within wheels, 
and is understood only by their managers." Mr. 
Alexander, himself a prominent figure in the polit- 
ical life of New York, does not claim to understand 
the politics of the State any more then did Wolcott, 
but he may justly lay claim to the distinction of 
possessing intimate knowledge of its political move- 
ments and familiarity with its leading politicians. 
He is not the only historian who has cherished the 
ambition to write an elaborate political history of the 
Empire State. Jabez Hammond's " Political History 
of New York," completed in 1848, covered the early 
field with remarkable thoroughness, although with 
less accuracy and system than characterized Mr. 
Alexander's work. The latter's method is rather 
that of the biographer than the historian. He clus- 
ters his facts around the careers of the great leaders, 
and makes them the central theme of his discussion 
of particular movements ; for, according to his view, 
" the history of a state or nation is largely the his- 
tory of a few of its leading men." It is true, as he 
says, that it would be difficult to find in any common- 
wealth of the Union a more interesting or picturesque 
leadership than is presented in the political history 
of New York. Some of those whose careers he traces 
through " the tangled web of New York politics " are 
Alexander Hamilton, George Clinton, Aaron Burr, 
DeWitt Clinton, Martin Van Buren, and Thurlow 
Weed, each of whom successively controlled the 
political destinies of the State. In addition to the 
portraitures of these great leaders, the work is en- 
livened with entertaining sketches of the struggles 
between " Bucktails " and " Clintonians," "Hunkers " 
and "Barnburners," and other factions into which 
the leading parties were at different times divided.

Books dealing with the classification 
and activities of hirds, or handbooks to local or to 
of birds. more extended faunas, are numerous, 

and studies of birds afield with gun or camera have 
multiplied almost to the limit of popular interest. 
Fortunately, we have in Mr. Beebe's " The Bird, its 
Form and Function " (Holt) a worthy treatise on the 
bird itself considered from the standpoint of its 
structure. The book is no dry assemblage of descrip- 
tive anatomical detail couched in technical terms 
which only the sj)ecialist in comparative anatomy 
can analyze. It is, rather, an untechnical study of 
the bird as a product of the process of organic evo- 
lution ; of a living structure wonderf idly adapted in 
manifold ways to the complex environments in which 
birds are found. Although the author deals constantly 
with the structural elements of the various organs 
of the animal — with shaft and barb, feather and 
claw, syrinx and gizzard — the anatomical skeleton 
is always clothed with a living interest and rendered 
full of meaning as illustrative of some broad bio- 
logical law, and is related to the significant funda- 
mental principle of the evolution of all life. The 
author marshalls his facts with the skill and judg- 
ment which are evidently the result of an adequate 
training in the biological sciences, and he has added 
to his knowledge the zeal of an enthusiastic lover 
of the feathered tribes. He loses no opportunity to 
inculcate a love for ••' the little bundles of muscle and 
blood which in this freezing weather can transmute 
frozen beetles and zero air into a happy, cheery little 
Black-capped Chicadee," and to engender a respect 
for the living brain which " can generate a sympathy, 
a love for its mate, which in sincerity and unsel- 
fishness suffer little when compared with human 
affection." The illustrations in the work are mainly 
from photographs — most of them presented here 
for the first time, — drawn often from sources in 
the New York Zoological Gardens or the American 
Museum of Natural History. With a few possible 
exceptions, they really illustrate the text, and are 
well chosen and well executed. The work is a wel- 
come addition to the popular literature of ornithol- 
ogy, of substantial merit and permanent value for 
every lover and student of denizens of the air. 

Pleasant scenes ^he fascination of Japan finds a sym- 
from familiar pathetic interpreter in A. Herbage

up the volume entitled "Kakemono" — upon the 
supposition, it may be assumed, that the word, liter- 
ally " hang-up-thing," signifies a picture or pictures, 
there being no plural form in Japanese, whereas it 
denotes the manner of mounting rather than the 
pictures themselves — are charming word-paintings, 
wrought with a light touch and true poetic feeling. In 
their daintiness and half-veiled impressions, many of 
them seem to have been inspired by the hokku or 
short odes that play such an important part in the life 
of the people of that unique country. The subjects 
are all familiar; indeed, nothing else could be ex- 
pected, so thoroughly have Japan and its inhabitants 



been written about. But in literary art, as in pictorial, 
it is the treatment that makes the difference. De- 
scriptions of the ascent of Fuji-san are so common 
that one's first inclination is to skip another relation 
of the toilsome climb. Yet to pass by the account 
here given woidd be to leave unread what is perhaps 
the most delightfully written of them all. Even more 
impressive is the story of a trip to the summit of the 
ever active volcano Asamayama. The dismal horror 
of the experience, in striking contrast to the more 
arduous but tamer journey to the top of Fuji, is made 
very real by a recital of the pleasing anticipations 
with which it was undertaken. These episodes occupy 
but a small part of the book. Religion, art, travel, 
the people and their customs, and personal experi- 
ences of the author, furnish the material for most of 
the sketches. Especially striking is the one entitled 
" The Altar of Fire," in which the Shinto ceremony 
of hiwatari, or walking barefoot over a bed of live 
coals, is graphically described. No attempt is made 
to explain the seemingly impossible phenomenon: 
for that, the reader must have recourse to the pages 
of Percival Lowell. The essay upon " The Art of 
the People " contains many observations worthy of 
serious consideration. A complete view of Japan, the 
book does not give ; the unpleasant features are left 
for others to portray. But that omission makes it the 
more agreeable to read. (A. C. McClurg & Co.)

matic negotiations that finally accomplished this 
result. He has given a very ftdl account of some . 
things which, so far as the main thesis is concerned, 
might have been dealt with much more briefly. On 
the whole, however, the work has been well done, 
and the book is a valuable contribution to our his- 
torical literature on this important subject. The 
style is easy and readable, and the author's judg- 
ments are well balanced, in spite of occasional sharp 
words about the conduct of such men as Jackson, 
J. Q. Adams, Pickering, and EUicott. Of positive 
errors the writer has discovered only a few, and 
these are of minor importance. The change of the 
boundary of West Florida from 31° to 32° 28' was 
made in the commission of George Johnstone, Gov- 
ernor of West Florida, June 6, 1764, instead of in that 
of Governor Elliott (p. 34 ). (See Commons Jom-nal, 
vol. 39, p. 174.) Owe could wish for a little more 
exactness in some of the statements, — for example, 
that Amelia Island "was soon abandoned by the 
American marines " to escape yellow fever (p. 236). 
How soon? It was occupied December 24-26, 
1817, and General Gaines was there more than a 
year later. The chief defect of the book lies in its

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



paucity of references. Such a book must appeal 
first of all to the specialist ; and the specialist must 
have footnotes. The author has brought out a good 
deal of new and interesting matter for which he has 
given no authority whatever. References to diplo- 
matic papers are abundant, but often details are 
given which can hardly have been gathered from 
this source. 

The legal side ^} ^« ^ pleasure to readers of Lincoln 
of Lincoln's life literature to come upon a really in- 
and character, structive book in that much-worked 
field. There are books and articles without number, 
largely the result of working over the same old 
material, many of them with the same old miscon- 
ceptions and the dubious or disproved anecdotes. 
Mr. Frederick Trevor Hill, in his " Lincoln the 
Lawyer " ( The Centm-y Co. ) , has developed some 
new points of interest in Lincoln's life. Taking well- 
known facts and adding to them important new ones 
of his own discovery, he has combined what is known 
of Lincoln's legal career in such a way as to show 
conclusively that he was a lawyer of very superior 
ability both in working out his cases and in liis 
success in the courts. In competition with a bar 
remarkable for force and talent, he became the 
acknowledged leader, manifesting in the highest 
degree the various qualities demanded for success in 
his exacting profession. But more important than 
the fact of Lincoln's professional success is the bear- 
ing of his legal attainments on his great public 
career. It was his insight into the fundamental 
principles of law and logic, and the training that he 
had received from his long and successful practice, 
that enabled him to triumph over Douglas in debate, 
to make the Cooper Institute Speech that carried his 
reputation into the East, to " dissect the slavery 
question so thoroughly, and to meet the various diffi- 
cult problems of his later career. Mr. Hill has done 
well in bringing out this important side of Lincoln's 
training and equipment. Incidentally, he destroys 
some of the myths that have been handed down 
from one writer to another, some of them detracting 
from the real dignity of the man ; and for this also 
we are grateful. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Sig. M. Esposito is the editor of a collection of " Early 
Italian Piano Music," just added by the Oliver Ditson 
Co. to their " Musicians' Library." The introductory 
matter consists of biographical sketches of the composers 
represented, and descriptive notes on the harpsichord and 
clavichord, with full-page photographic plates. The 
composers, seventeen in number, range from Ercole Pas- 
goini (1580) to Muzio Clementi (1752-1832). The two 
Scarlattis have a large share of the space, Alessardro 
being represented by six pieces, and Domenico by the 
series of nineteen sonnets, with the " Cati Fugue " as an 
appendix. Readers of " Cousuelo " will be interested 
in the specimen fugue from Porpera, and students of 
Browning by the piece from Galuppi — a sonata and 
not a toccata. 



A new translation of " The Nibelungenlied," made by 
the late John Storer Cobb, and now edited by his widow, 
is published in a handsome volume by Messrs. Small, 
Maynard & Co. The form is a rhymed four-line stanza 
in iambic octometer, the rhymes being in couplets. It 
is a jog-trot movement, and grows very monotonous after 
a few pages. But a great poem, in the higher sense, tliis 
epic is not, and a fair sense of its historical importance 
is obtainable from the present version. 

Two new editions of Shakespeare, each complete in a 
single volume, call for a word of hearty praise. One is 
added to the " Cambridge " poets of Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin, & Co., and the editorial work has been done by 
Mr. William Allan Neilson. There are upward of twelve 
hundred pages, with portrait, biography, glossary, and 
special introductions to the several plays. The other 
edition comes from the Oxford Clarendon Press, and is 
edited by Mr. W. J. Craig. This volume, with about one 
himdred more pages than the other, has portrait and 
glossary, but practically no editorial matter. Both edi- 
tions are clearly printed on thin paper, two columns to 
the page. 



Notes. 



" As You Like It " and « Henry the Fift " are the 
latest additions to the " First Folio " Shakespeare, as 
edited by Misses Porter and Clarke, and published by 
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

" The Lodging House Problem in Boston," by Dr. 
Albert Benedict Wolfe, is a volume of " Harvard Eco- 
nomic Studies," published at the expense of the Baldwin 
endowment by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

The Fleming H. Revell Co. publish new and revised 
editions of the Rev. W. J. Dawson's " Makers of En- 
glish Poetry " and " Makers of English Prose," two 
volumes of agreeable and for the most part sound and 
sensible literary criticism for popular consumption. 

James Russell Lowell and Mr. Henry James are the 
subjects of two new volumes in the series of beautifully- 
printed bibliographies of American authors published 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. For the former, 
Mr. George Willis Cooke is responsible, and Mr. Le 
Roy Phillips for the latter. 

A new " Encyclopedia of Familiar Quotations," com- 
piled by Mr. Elferd Eveleigh Treffry, is published by 
the Frederick A. Stokes Co. The selections niunber 
five thousand, and if many of them may not properly 
be styled " familiar," they are all likely to prove usefid 
for purposes of pointed illustration, and this is very 
largely what such collections are for. 

" The Book of Love," compiled by Mr. Adam L. 
Gowans, and published by Messrs. George W. Jacobs 
& Co., is described as a collection of " one hundred of 
the best love-poems in the English language." The 
description is fairly justified by the contents, although 
it would not be difficidt to collect another hundred 
lyrics of equal, or nearly equal, beauty. 

The Chicago Madrigal Club, which has offered yearly 
prizes for musical compositions to accompany poems 
chosen by it for a musical setting, will this year vary 
its programme by offering its prize for an original 
lyric poem to be hereafter set to music. The prize is 
fifty dollars, and the competition is open to all writers 
residing in the United States. A printed circular giv- 
ing conditions of the contest may be had by addressing 
Mr. D. A. Clippinger, 410 Kimball Hall, Chicago.

PUTNAM'S MONTHLY 

FOR 1907 

"This first number comes into the library like a well= 
bred person who knows how to sit before the fire and 
talk at ease; who has seen the world, who knows 
books, and has learned and practises the art of human 
intercourse. The magazine starts quietly, and puts into 
the hands of its readers, in a style which is in line with 
good literary traditions, matter which is worth reading." 

— The Outlook. 

PRIMEVAL MAN 

THE .JANUARY NUMBER contains a fvill account, by Robert F. Gilder, of his recent 
finding, in a grave-mound in Nebraska, of the skull of a human being of lower cranial develop- 
ment than any other yet unearthed in America. A similar discovery, some years since, in Java, 
and another in Switzerland, give special significance to this skull as indicating the existence of a 
race of inferior intelligence to any other of which records exist, and Mr. Gilder's important find is 
attracting the attention of the leading biologists of the country. The discoverer's personal narrative, 
together with the supplementary papers of a scientific character, is appropriately illustrated.

IMPORT ANT NEW BOOKS 

Four Aspects of Civic Duty 

By WILLIAM H. TAFT, Secretary of War 

Four brilliant essays on the duties of citizenship viewed from the standpoint of a recent graduate of a 
University, of a Judge on the Bench, of Colonial Administration, and of the National Executive. The 
sound, inspiring, and ably expressed views of one of the foremost Americans whose wide experience in the 
most important positions lends the greatest authority to his words on such vital subjects as our purposes, 
present position, and future policy in the Philippines, the powers and development of the National Executive, 
and our attitude toward the courts and their place in our scheme of government. $1.00 net, postpaid $1.08. 
" The group makes up a philosophical treatise on Americanism that, quite apart from the national services of the 
writer, would be sufficient to make a reputation. But, on the other hand, the real importance of the volume lies 
largely in the fact that Mr. Taft talks as a man of vast experience and knowledge." — New York Sun. 

Corea: The Hermit Nation 

By WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS 

A new and revised edition of this standard work, bringing the account of the liistory of the country down 
to 1906, with much new and important information in regard to present conditions in Corea. With a 
map corrected to the present time. Illustrated, $2.50. 

" The work bears witness to a vast amount of well-directed labor, while it is clothed with a rare charm for the 
general reader, whose curiosity regarding a long isolated nation will be satisfied ; it is also sure of a respectful and 
grateful reception from the student of history, ethnology, and philosophy." — New York Sun. 

The Cambridge Apostles 

By Mrs. CHARLES BROOKFIELD, author of « Mrs. Brookfield and Her Circle." Illustrated. $5.00 net. 
A brilliant account of the remarkable group of young men at Cambridge University, which included 
Temiyson, Buller, Lord Houghton, Trench, John Sterling, and Spedding, made up of letters and reminis- 
cences of the most entertaining kind, delightfully written by the author of " Mrs. Brookfield and Her Circle." 
"It deals with the same group of brilliant men [as 'Mrs. Brookfield and Her Circle'], and is inspired by the 
same cheerful and admiring spirit." — New York Tribune. 

The Peter Pan Alphabet 

By OLIVER HERFORD. With drawings by the author. $1.00 net; postage 8 cents. 
A verse and a drawing for each letter about some person or scene in the play — Peter himself, Hook, 
Nana, the Crocodile, the Pirates, the Wolves, Wendy, and the rest — are all inimitably drawn and rhymed.

FERDINAND BRUNETIERE. 



In one of the lectures which he gave in this 
country, when he visited us several years ago, 
Brunetiere used the following words : 

" The first condition of disinterestedness is never to 
follow one's tastes, and to begin by distrusting the 
things which give ns pleasure. The most delicious dishes 
are not the most wholesome ; we never fail to distinguish 
between our cooks and our doctors. In the moral world 
the beginning of virtue is to distrust what is most natu- 
ral to us, and the same is true in the intellectual world. 
To distrust what we like is the beginning of wisdom in 
art and literature." 

We quoted this passage at the time when the 
distinguished Frenchman was our guest, and 
we now quote it again because it illustrates so 
clearly the fundamental characteristic of Bru- 
netiere's critical attitude toward literature. 
First and last he stood for authority in criticism 
as opposed to impressionism and caprice, for 
objective standards as opposed to subjective 
fancies, for law as opposed to anarchy in the 
appreciation of books. 

As the chief champion in our time of the 
principle of authority in criticism, Brunetiere 
occupied a distinguished position, and his loss 
is one of the most serious possible to the world 
of letters. He stood like a rock amid the flood 
of critical writing that has been steadily swelling 
of recent years, and that has no other creden- 
tials to offer for its acceptance than the posses- 
sion of verbal charm, the display of intellectual 
agility, and the appeal to the hedonistic impulses 
of our nature. In his resistance to the disinte- 
grating forces that seemed to him to be threat- 
ening disaster to the fine art of literature, he 
grew more and more uncompromising in his 
pronouncements, more and more reactionary in 
his attitude, and the end found him sending 
apart, in grim isolation, from most of the ad- 
vancing movements and liberalizing tendencies 
of his age. It was a stand that challenged admi- 
ration, even when it revealed him as the foe of 
justice in the Dreyfus affair, as the enemy of 
social and political progress in his ultramontane 
partisanship, and as the opponent, in the name 
of the classical seventeenth century, of those 
literary developments which, not wholly for good 
but assuredly not wholly for ill, were bestowing 



28 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



a distinctive character upon his own age, and 
were preparing the way for the age that should 
come after him. 

The man who commits himself to the prin- 
ciple of authority in criticism incurs certain 
dangers, no doubt, which Brunetiere's career 
illustrates. He is sure to be a conservative, and 
extreme conservatism is almost as much to be 
avoided as extreme radicalism. The conserva- 
tive view is pretty sure to be the soimd one in 
the majority of cases, because it results from 
the tested opinions of many minds ; whereas the 
radical view is always experimental, and stands 
a fair chance of being proved untenable. But 
no lesson drawn from the history of thought is 
plainer than that radical views are sometimes 
right, and that the conservative ideas they op- 
pose may be crusted prejudices rather than rea- 
soned judgments. The critic of to-day is the heir 
of all the ages, but he is also an observer from 
the vantage-point of the new time, with its more 
refined instruments and its broadened horizons. 
There can hardly be a doubt that Brimetiere set 
his gaze too resolutely toward the past, and that 
his devotion to the ideals of Bossuet and Racine 
made him incapable of doing full justice to 
Renan and Hugo. 

There was, moreover, an irreconcilable con- 
tradiction between the critic in his character of 
laudator temporls acti and his character as the 
expositor of the principle of literary evolution. 
This principle was the philosophical basis of his 
later writings, and his defence thereof constitutes 
his chief claim to a permanent place in the his- 
tory of criticism. One of the many statements 
that he made of it may be quoted. 

" A given variety of literature, for instance, the En- 
glish drama of the sixteenth century, or the French 
comedy of the seventeenth century, or the English 
novel of the eighteenth century, is in process of devel- 
opment, slowly organizing itself under the double influ- 
ence of the interior and exterior ' environment.' The 
movement is slow and the differentiation almost insen- 
sible. Suddenly, and without its being possible to give 
the reason, a Shakespeare, a Molifere, or a Richardson 
appears, and forthwith not only is the variety modified, 
but new species have come into being: psychological 
drama, the comedy of character, the novel of manners. 
The superior adaptability and power of survival of the 
new species are at once recognized and proved, indeed, 
in practice. It is in vain that the older species attempt 
to struggle: their fate is sealed in advance. The suc- 
cessors of Richardson, Molifere, and Shakespeare copy 
these unattainable models until, their fecundity being 
exhausted — and by their fecundity I mean their apti- 
tude for struggling with kindred and rival species — 
the imitation is changed into a routine which becomes 
a source of weakness, impoverishment, and death for 
the species. I shall not easily be persuaded that this 
manner of considering the history of literature or art 



is calculated to detract from the originality of great 
artists or great writers. On the contrary, as is doubt- 
less perceived, it is precisely their individuality that is 
responsible for the constitution of new species, and in 
consequence for the evolution of literature and art." 

It is not difficult to see that the principle thus 
formulated must act as a solvent of the tra- 
ditional criticism of authority, and that its ac- 
ceptance must render obsolete, in very large 
measure, the method of judging contemporary 
products by the closeness with which they meas- 
ure up to classical standards. And it is also 
fairly evident to the reader of Brunetiere's crit- 
icism of contemporary literature that his admi- 
ration of the past deadened his alertness to the 
possibilities of the present, and to no inconsid- 
erable extent dulled in him the prophetic sense. 
But the extremes to which modern impres- 
sionism has gone are such as to drive almost 
any judicially-minded critic into the camp of 
reaction ; and it is small wonder that Brune- 
tiere's balanced intellect, with its sense of his- 
torical perspective and its temper of essential 
sanity, should have been repelled by the restless 
extravagances of current critical expression, and 
should have sought refuge in the haven of a past 
of defined and realized ideals. The tide of recent 
criticism has set so strongly against any form 
of law or any sort of acceptance of authority 
that we cannot but be grateful for the steadying 
influence exerted — always forcibly if not ex- 
actly gracefully — by the great critic who has 
just died. He has fought stoutly for thirty years 
in what must be admitted, despite certain defects 
of sympathy and aberrations of judgment, to 
have been a good cause, and his memory is de- 
serving of all honor. Whether or not his books 
will continue to be read far into the future, we 
cannot foretell ; if they fall too speedily into 
neglect and forgetfulness, we feel bound to 
believe that it will be so much the worse for 
the future. 



THE MASTERNOTE IN LITERATURE. 



Death is the shadow which defines light. It is 
the mystery which underscores and emphasizes life. 
It is the negation which makes the assertion of 
existence valuable. The poetry of life, even the 
poetry of love, cannot compare with the poetry of 
death. At the touch of death the common masks 
of life are dropped, the vulgar veils of flesh dissolve, 
and high and stately forms step forth, — imagina- 
tions unembodied on earth, possibilities unhinted in 
the race we know. 

I have no desire to add a page to Drelincoiu*t on 
Death. But impatience consumes one at our modern 
attitude to the great, serious, and tragic themes of 



190T.] 



THE DIAL 



29 



thought and art. Especially does our American 
hedonism, our love of pleasure, our fear of pain or 
shock, rebel at the best and highest in literature. 
We g^asp at the shallow criticism which speaks of 
the pessimistic, the melancholy, the gloomy, as the 
minor note. Even in music, from which this term 
is borrowed, it is not true that melancholy themes 
or notes which excite sad impressions are secondary. 
Most of the great symphonies, oratorios, requiems, 
are sad and stormy and terrible. And the same 
conditions are so plain in literature that a critic 
must apologize for pointing it out. But, our childish 
readers say, there is enough that is painful and 
shocking and horrible in life, — why reiterate it in 
literature? Wordsworth prayed for frequent sights 
of what is to be borne. We do not acquire fortitude 
by running away from danger, and a literature of 
lollipops is not likely to make a strong race. The 
tragic part of literature is the most tonic and most 
inspiring. 

But to our task, which is to try to draw out the 
themes and situations in literature which have to do 
with death. First, there is the bier, the tomb, the 
grave themselves. Shakespeare frequently intro- 
duces the dead upon a bier. Antony comes to bury 
Caesar, not to praise him. Richard wooes Anne over 
the bier of her husband. King Lear's heart cracks 
as Cordelia is borne in. Then there is the tomb of 
the Capulets, Hamlet at Ophelia's grave, the funeral 
of Imogen. Hugo has Hernani amid the tombs of 
the kings ; and in Byron's " Prisoner of ChUlon " 
the prison becomes a grave. The grave yawned at 
every step in English eighteenth-century literature. 
Gray's " Elegy," Blair's " Grave," Young's " Night 
Thoughts," testify to the nerves of a people who 
were not afraid to face death. The Romantic school 
in Germany dealt so much in shrouds and cerements 
and fleshless bones that their literature is like an 
undertaking establishment. 

Burial alive is a theme which so fascinated the 
imagination of our greatest American literary artist 
that he made it the basis of several of his stories. 
Its possibilities are summed up, however, in Juliet's 
speech. Suspension of life by means of drugs is a 
common enough factor of plot. Juliet herself simu- 
lates death in that way. The deception of death is 
used by Shakespeare in the " Winter's Tale " and 
" Much Ado about Nothing." 

Temples, cathedrals, churches, are man's tribute 
altars to deatli. From Delphi and Stonehenge down 
they have been favored haunts of fiction, and in 
"Notre Dame" Victor Hugo has summed up and 
expressed the sentunent tliat attaches to them. 

Dead cities, ruins, relics of the past, these breathe 
forth the very odor of death. Marius meditating 
over the ruins of Carthage, Ossian apostrophising 
Balclutha, ChUde Harold wandering among deserted 
fanes, — these are figures that occur in this con- 
nection. 

Waste places, deserts, mountain tops, — these are 
nature's monuments of death. The first Christian 
anchorites, each one of whom was a memento m^ri, 



a living denial of life, retired to the edge of the 
Egyptian desert. Balzac's " Passion in the Desert " 
expresses some of the sentiment of such places, and 
Flaubert's Tentation de St. Antoine gives the hal- 
lucinations which arise in them. Leopardi's " Ode 
to the Ginestra " expresses the mountain desolation 
and much besides. 

Men are subject to partial deaths — loss of limbs, 
decay of faculties, paralysis, age. Invalidism is in 
literature in a thousand forms. Two of its oddest 
figures are the hero of Balzac's Peau de Chagrin 
who had his life shortened every time he made a 
wish, and Peter Schlemihl.who lost his shadow. 

There is a vast deal of poetry dedicated to the 
death of the year — Autumn. I am inclined to 
think that the Spring poets are not so prolific, nor 
have they so good a subject. 

World engulfments, such as earthquakes, tidal- 
waves, volcanic destructions, are, like great wars, 
on too big a scale for literature to handle easily. 
Bulwer's " Last Days of Pompeii " is an effort in 
this field, and there is a story of Jules Verne's about 
the partial destruction of the earth by a comet. 

All these matters, however, are the mere fringe 
of our subject, the penumbra of the black eclipse. 
The centi-al body of tragedy is concerned with the 
agonies and deaths of single figures and selected 
groups. The wholesale massacres of war are, as I 
have said, at once too vast and too business-like to 
be of much use in fiction. The execution done by 
the ancient epic heroes was more interesting than 
anything of the kind since. As a fighter in the Iliad 
or uSneid, you had a rather intimate and engaging 
task before you. You met your opponent face to 
face ; you could select the special joint or organ you 
wished to carve or aim at ; you saw the blood gush 
and the death-spasm convulse him, — and then you 
passed on to other work. In the middle ages, when 
your foe was a moving tower of steel, you were a 
great deal less in touch with him ; and in modern 
times, when unseen you pump lead at an invisible 
enemy a mile away, there can be no personal inter- 
est in the business at all. 

In the main, epic poetry is outward rather than 
inward, physical rather than spiritual, martial rather 
than tragic. The glitter of arms, sounding of trum- 
pets, neighing of horses, descriptions of apparel, 
houses, .cities, — all the panorama of earth, ocean, 
air, — these, ordered of course by some great event, 
are its subject matter. The deaths in it are inci- 
dental rather than inevitable. But in tragedy every- 
thing draws onward to the final stroke of fate. In 
the Agamemnon, all the incidents, — the first glare 
of the beacon, the murmuring of the chorus about 
the dreadful past of the House of Atreus, the 
shrinkings and vaticinations of Cassandra, — lead 
up to the moment when the doors are thrown open 
and Clytemnestra is seen leaning on the blood- 
stained axe. The whispers of the Witches on the 
blasted heath fearfully presage the horrors that are 
to come in Macbeth. The ghost appears to Hamlet, 
and then there can be nothing but death and deso-

lation at Elsinore. It is this concentration of all 
effects upon a certain point, and that point the death 
of one or more great characters, which makes 
tragedy the most impressive work of man. 

There are deaths of high and holy mystery, — 
such as that of Moses, rapt away to his unknown 
grave ; Elisha, caught up hy the fiery chariot ; and 
CEdipus at Colonus, whose death, " if ever any was, 
was wonderful." Another is the living death of 
Prometheus, chained to the rock, his vitals continu- 
ally eaten and continually renewed, until he consents 
to yield his secret to Zeus. 

Death scenes which hardly amount to high tragedy 
may yet rank as most pathetic and effective pages 
of fiction. How many tears have been shed over the 
death of Little Nell er Paul Dombey ! What rather 
higher emotions have been roused by the passing 
away of Lefevre or Colonel Newcome ! And the 
death of Porthos, — that scene alone would make 
Dumas immortal. 

Newspaper writers invariably condemn the inter- 
est in murders as morbid. I am not sure I know 
what morbidity means, for I continually find myself 
applauding things in literature which persons of 
more delicate sensibilities tell me are tainted with 
that quality. I suppose the morbid is the abnormal, 
the unnatural. If this is so, the whole human race 
must be steeped in it, for there is nothing that so 
attracts and interests mankind as a murder. De 
Quincey's grotesque papers on " Murder considered 
as a Fine Art" hardly overstate this interest. I 
suppose the feeling of the many in this matter is a 
compound of sympathy with the victim whose per- 
son and past is suddenly lifted into a glare of light, 
a sickening sense that the same thing might happen 
to themselves, a desire for revenge, and a shock of 
excitement which raises them for the moment above 
the dull routine of life. All these feelings are nat- 
ural. Probably three-fourths of the tragic pieces of 
the world, and a goodly share of the novels, are 
based on murder or suicide themes. 

Death overhanging but evaded, as in hair-breadth 
escapes, heroic histories, adventures by land and 
sea, forms a main strand of fiction. 

But death is the gate to the other world. Man- 
kind marches through its open portals, and comes 
not back. What do come back are troops of ghosts 
and gods, philosophies and religions, thoughts that 
assuage and assure. 

The scientific method has of late been applied 
to animism — to occult and spiritual phenomena. 
Cases have been counted and tabulated, the credi- 
bility of witnesses investigated ; a vote has been 
taken, as it were, on the subject. Probably the re- 
sults will not convince anybody who did not believe 
before. But it is made certain that animism is as 
deeply rooted in the modern world as it ever was. 
And it is equally certain that its manifestations 
afford the best kind of literary material — that they 
are the very bi-ood of awe and wonder and mystical 
predominance. 

Ghosts are the most natural, the simplest, of the 



spirit tribes. The human being desires or dreads 
companionship with the departed, and the Appear- 
ance comes. Or more frequently the Apparition is 
driven to walk the earth to expiate crimes commit- 
ted there, or to relieve itself of the burden of some 
secret. The ancients had such a fully equipped 
establishment of spiritual agencies that they did not 
have much recourse to ghosts. And these were too 
tame and gentle for the demonologists of the Dark 
Ages. Shakespeare really did most to propel them 
into literature. The ghost in Hamlet, Banquo's spirit, 
the apparitions that rose before Richard, these estab- 
lished the standing of the family in literature. 

The opposition between Good and Evil in the 
world was largely the origin of Demonology. People 
saw plainly enough that Evil usually had the upper 
hand, so they proceeded to worship or propitiate its 
deities. Eiirope kept a huge standing army of these 
things on foot for centuries, reaching from Beelzebub 
himself down to the humblest gnome or elf, with 
witches and warlocks for their human intermediaries. 
The Djinns, Afreets, Genii, Ghouls of Persia and 
Arabia, were an allied race. Folk-lore and popular 
legend are full of such imaginations, and Goethe has 
pictured their Olympus in Faust. 

Magicians, miracle-workers, interpreters of sig^ns, 
infest all ages. Such were the Enchanters who 
failed before Aaron, or the Magi who had to give 
place to Daniel. The early men of science were not 
only accounted miracle-workers by the populace, 
but themselves struggled to acquu'e occult powers. 
Pythagoras, Empedocles, ApoUonius of Tyana, Par- 
acelsus, Friar Bacon, and even in recent times 
Mesmer and Cagliostro, were probably half impos- 
tors, half seekers for the truth. The whole spirit of 
such personages is summed up in fiction by the single 
figure of Faust. Dumas's " Memoirs of a Physician " 
is an immense and amusing explication of it. 

Gods are an integral part of the greatest litera- 
ture. In the big times of poetry, writers began from 
Jove and not from their neighbor in a street-car. 
And audiences took it as a compliment to them- 
selves to see divinities fighting, or conversing with, 
or making love to, their own ancestors. The vast 
elemental mythologies of India or Greece or Scan- 
dinavia tell yet on our imaginations. They tell 
more profoundly than anything that can be devised 
to-day. It cannot too often be repeated that religion 
and philosophy and literature are one. They are 
synonymous terms for the same thing. Religion is 
sometimes the text, philosophy the comment, and 
literature the visualising agency ; but sometimes one 
precedes and sometimes another. The theogany of 
Hesiod came after the creation of' Homer. The 
hymns of the Rig- Veda, the Upanishads, and the 
Hindu epics, followed in unknown order ; but they 
are all literature, and all religion, and all philosophy. 
The vast Catholic mythology was built up with scant 
reference to the Scriptures. 

The religious principles which have to do with 
death and the hereafter, the ideas of resurrection 
and immortality, have their philosophic counterparts 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

in Plato's Theory of Ideas and the Hindu thought 
of Maya or Illusion. But the philosophical schemes 
are comparatively barren for literature ; whereas 
the religious ones burst out into creation everywhere. 
The final scenes of the Maha-bharata, the episodes in 
the Greek and Latin poets dealing with Hades and 
Elysium, and, final summation of the whole, Dante's 
great poem, testify to the fruitfulness of those ideas. 

Multiplicity rather than unity is the ruling spirit 
of literature. It must have opposing forces, strife, 
varied pictures of life. The tribal systems of Indian 
cosmogany, the dualism of Zoroaster, the delicately 
divided mythology of Greece, are all conformable 
to its laws. Even when it gets a pure monotheism 
like the Jewish, it pi-oceeds as quickly as possible 
to transform it into a dualism and then into a trinity 
of good opposed to multiple powers of evil. For 
this reason, the Buddhistic idea of Nirvana can 
work little good for literature. There is a question 
whether the true doctrine of Nirvana is annihila- 
tion, or only resumption into God and the being 
freed from the pain of new birth. The latter inter- 
pretation is probably the Hindu one, while Euro- 
pean thinkers who have accepted the doctrine — 
Schopenhauer above all — lean to the first. It is 
obvious that neither branch of this principle has any 
possibilities of literary growth and efflorescence. 

Modern science is also in some sense paralyzing 
to literature. When it discovers myriads of organ- 
ized creatures in a drop of water, and divides these 
again unto infinity into atoms and units of force, 
the human imagination is appalled and dismayed. 
Similarly, when it shows us streams of stars, clouds 
of nebulae, universe upon universe, floating like 
bubbles on the bosom of ether — which substance 
itself is like death, a negation, yet the most potent 
thing there is — we may be inspired, but it is with 
an insjiiration which cannot realize itself in concrete 
terms. 

In beginning this series of brief inquiries into the 
root-ideas of fiction, I said that all literature is buUt 
up from a few scraps of nature and human experi- 
ence. This is not to say that it is, in its results, simple. 
Many, perhaps most, writers have a predilection for 
a certain set of impressions, a certain sphere of action 
or thought. They write love lyrics, and they think 
that love lyrics are the whole of poetry ; they pho- 
tograph contemporary life, and they insist that such 
work is all that is worth doing. But if from the two- 
score or more of syllabled sounds all the languages of 
the world have been built up, if from the eighty sim- 
ple elements there is made the whole universe, what 
are the possibilities of scheme and combination with 
the individual units of the human race ? The count 
of those that are or have been rise in their myriads to 
numbers beyond name. Yet no two have been alike. 
Each human being has viewed and reflected the uni- 
verse at a different angle and has been shuffled among 
his compeers in a different way. The possibilities 
of character and situation and plot are practically 

limitless. ^ -r

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Some of the problems of book publishing are 
brought out in a forcible way by Mr. John Murray, the 
veteran London publisher, in an article in the December 
" Contemporary Review." Referring to the " Times 
book- war," and intimating that the "Thunderer" is 
grievously in error as to divers book-trade matters, Mr. 
Murray passes on to points of general interest in con- 
nection with his business. Some of its difficulties are 
experienced in the sudden and mysterious dead stop 
that may occur in the sale of almost any book at any 
time; in the unacknowledged and impaid-for editorial 
supervision that a work may call for after acceptance ; 
in the large demand for free copies of books (five for 
copyright purposes alone, in England); and m the 
doubling, in the last thirty years, of a publisher's gen- 
eral establishment expenses. The popular belief that 
Gladstone could secure the success of any book was 
proved false in the failure of three promising biographies 
published by Mr. Miu-ray, two of them at Gladstone's 
instigation, and all three puffed by reviews, speeches, and 
private commendation from the great statesman. Pride 
in producing works of lasting value prompted the issue 
of the " Dictionary of Christian Biography," the " Dic- 
tionary of Hymnology," and the " Classical Atlas "; but 
these praiseworthy undertakings still show a deficit of 
more thousands of pounds than the publisher cares to 
name. No business in London^ concludes the writer, 
except perhaps the management of a great newspaper, 
demands so much imremitting labor, alertness, and atten- 
tion to infinite detail, as the business of publishing books.

The revival of interest in the drama manifests 
itself in more ways than one. An encouraging symptom 
is the establishment in Berlin of a " chamber theatre " 
for the elect of cultured and discriminatingly apprecia- 
tive play-goers, those who enjoy " intimate " acting and 
to whom the conventional clap-trap of the stage is 
wearisome. In an oblong room panelled with mahogany, 
with no galleries or boxes, and without painted decora- 
tions, the spectator sinks into a luxurious arm-chair 
(for which he has paid twenty marks, by the purchase 
of eight tickets for the season) and is entertained by 
(let us say) a presentation of Ibsen's " Ghosts," in which 
the actors depend for effect wholly on their own intel- 
lectual and emotional equipment, foregoing the adven- 
titious aid of false hair on head or face, of paint, and of 
all the arts and devices employed in the ordinary stage 
" make-up." Any forcing of the note would be out of 
harmony with the smallness and the tasteful simplicity 
of the " chamber theatre," and there is nothing to mar 
the enjoyment of the play as the production of a master 
mind interpreted by gifted and sympathetic artists. 
The only regret is that the sphere of immediate influence 
of so praiseworthy an innovation should, of necessity, 
be so restricted. Yet even thus some measure of leav- 
ening downward may be looked for, as always in move- 
ments that make for the elevating of art and literature.

The endowment of " lazyships " at Harvard was 
once recommended by Lowell. The wisdom of the 
learned man which cometh by opportunity of leisure, as 
the Preacher puts it, is not exactly the wisdom striven 
for by the late President Harper's ideal professor who 
was to toil strenuously and gladly eleven months of the

year in order to recuperate (in a sanatorium) during the 
twelfth — or perhaps to be cut off in his prime, as was 
Dr. Harper himself. The decay of academic leisure is 
deplored by Mr. Irving Babbitt in the current " Har- 
vard Graduates' Magazine." This writer aptly quotes 
Professor Bosanquet's words : " Leisure — the word 
from which our word ' school ' is derived — was for the 
Greek the expression of the highest moments of the 
mind. It was not labor; far less was it recreation. It 
was that employment of the mind in which, by great 
thoughts, by art and poetry which lift us above our- 
selves, by the highest exertion of the intelligence, as 
we should add, by religion, we obtain occasionally a 
sense of something that camiot be taken from us, a real 
oneness and centre in the universe; and which makes 
us feel that whatever happens to the present form of 
our little ephemeral personality, life is yet worth living 
because it has a real and sensible contact with some- 
thing of eternal value." The lesson is an old one, but 
not the less timely: what we are is more important 
than what we do; wise passiveness is sometimes better 
than bustling activity. The present low estate of poetry 
has been ascribed to our lack of that contemplative 
leisure which is more and more difficult to find in the 
strenuous conditions of our modern life. 



Teaching the yoxxng idea how to shoot (with 
rifles) is a development that probably the poet did not so 
much as dream of when he penned his familiar line. 
Yet the advocates of general conscription in England, 
the " Blue Funk School," as they have been styled, 
appear to have inflamed the patriotic frenzy to such a 
pitch that the phrase " children in arms " now takes on 
a new meaning. A Devonshire vicar, evidently a repre- 
sentative of the church militant, is even quoted as de- 
claring : " I would have every girl as well as every boy 
taught the use of the rifle, so as to be prepared, in case 
of emergency, to defend their homes, together with 
their brothers, husbands, and fathers. This is the spirit 
I inculcate in my parish. We want patriotic men and 
women, not cowards and sneaks." This reminds one of 
the turbulent paterfamilias and his blustering pronun- 
ciamento, " I will have peace in the family if I have to 
fight for it." The educational imbroglio in England 
has its amusing aspects, especially as viewed from oiit- 
side; but even an outsider can sympathize with the 
editor of " The Westminster Review," who thus frees 
his mind: "That rifle shooting should be taught in our 
elementary schools with the sanction of a Liberal Min- 
ister for education, affords an astonishing commentary 
upon our much-vaunted principles of ' Peace, Retrench- 
ment, and Reform.' " He trusts that the permission to 
add this new study to the curriculum will be speedily 
withdrawn — a consummation devoutly to be wished by 
all who hold that the reading-book is mightier than the 

Krag-Jorgenson rifle.

Aspects of American cities, as seen by an English 
visitor, Mr. Charles Whibley, best known as a sprightly 
essayist and the author of " A Book of Scoundrels," 
" The Pageantry of Life," and " Studies in Frankness," 
have lately been receiving attention in " Blackwood's 
Magazine." Of New York this observer says that " the 
most vivid and constant impression that remains is of a 
city where the means of life conquer life itself, whose 
citizens die hourly of the rage to live." Visiting Boston, 
he is moved to declare that no more sudden or striking 



contrast can be found in America than between these 
two cities. The comparative quiet and decorous aspect 
and conduct of the New England capital pleased him. 
" Nowhere in Boston," he affirms, '< will you find the 
extravagant ingenuity [in architecture] which makes 
New York ridicidous." Beacon Street he pronounces 
one of the most majestic streets in the world. Boston 
Common, the Old South Meeting-House, Faneuil Hall, 
the great university across the Charles — these and 
other places and institutions he warmly admires ; but in 
asserting that Harvard " still worships the classics with 
a constant heart" he must be deceived as to how little 
of Latin and how much less of Greek (or is it now none 
at all ?) are at present required for a B. A. degree from 
our oldest imiversity. " Culture," he says, " has always 
been at once the boast and the reproach of Boston"; 
and he proceeds to criticise, with some deserved ridi- 
cule, the Boston passion for lectures, an American 
eagerness to acquire much in the least possible time. 
But he adds, referring to culture: " Even now Boston, 
its earliest slave, is shaking off the yoke ; and it is taking 
refuge in the more modern cities of the West. Chicago 
is, I believe, its newest and vastest empire. There, 
where all is odd, it is well to be thought a ' thinker.' 
There, we are told, the elect believe it their duty ' to 
reach and stimulate others.' But wherever culture is 
found strange things are done in its name, and the time 
may come when by the light of Chicago's brighter lamp 
Boston may seem to dwell in the outer darkness." 



A CUKIOSITY IN COMMERCIAL LITERATURE, and at the 

same time a gratifying bit of evidence that, in these 
days of mammon-worship, of graft, of investigating 
committees, and of mud-rakers, we are not all gomg 
straight to perdition, is found in a seedsman's trade 
catalogue from an Eastern business house. With a sub- 
lime trust in man's (and woman's) better nature, the 
head of this establishment has built up a prosperous 
business with none of the modern appliances of book- 
keeping and auditing, checks and balances, that seem 
to rest on the theory that everybody is presumably a 
rogue until he is proved honest. The following reads 
like a page from the description of trade methods in 
some Utopian Spotless-Town: "The head clerks (they 
are ladies) pay themselves each week from the funds 
received by the one acting as treasurer. From year's 
end to year's end no receipt passes between us. When- 
ever the treasurer finds more money on her hands than 
she needs she passes it over to me, and I put it in my 
pocket without counting it. It is the same with the 
clerk below ; he pays off the men, and from time to time 
passes over to me the surplus, no receipt for moneys 
received or paid out ever being passed between us. The 
clerks at large have always been paid by the hour; they 
keep their own accounts, hand these in to the lady in 
charge of their department at the close of each week, 
and are paid accordingly. During all my fifty years in 
business there has never been any reason to doubt the 
honesty of these weekly accounts." AH this, and more 
in the same pleasant strain, is in reply to a customer 
who, having sent money in an unregistered letter and 
failed to hear of its receipt, imputed dishonesty to some 
clerk in the firm's employ. We are tempted to contrast 
with these humane methods the system in use at an 
institution of quite another sort, an institution dedicated 
to the cause of polite literature, — a public library, in 
short, — where the assistants are not free from the

irksome and humiliating, if not demoralizing, restraints 
and checks that are so happily miknown and unneeded 
in this other institution whose avowed object is the 
piirsuit of gain. ... 

London literary happenings, past, present, and 
future, are claiming attention with the coming in of 
the new year. Miss Mary Cholmondeley's " Prisoners " 
is pronounced to have been " the novel of the year " in 
England. The last twelvemonth has seen the death of 
many eminent English authors, including Dr. Richard 
Garnett, Mrs. Craigie ("John Oliver Hobbes"), Mrs. 
Chesson (" Nora Hopper "), William Sharp (a dual or 
multiple personality, " Fiona Macleod " being but one 
of his phases), and F. W. Maitland, the biographer 
of Leslie Stephen. While we are prepariag for our 
Longfellow centenary in February, the English are 
planning to celebrate, two months later, the two hun- 
dredth birthday of a genius of quite another order — 
Henry Fielding. The London literary correspondent 
of a leading New York journal proclaims, in addition, 
the forthcoming observance, in December, of still 
another bicentenary — that of Jolm Wesley. But this 
good man and ever-enjoyable diarist was duly belauded 
and be-written three years and a half ago. Probably 
the correspondent means John's brother Charles (he 
says his man wrote 6500 hynms), and the hymn- writer 
was indeed born in December of the year 1707 — incor- 
rectly given in the old reference books as 1708. 
... 

An artificial world-language, even for business 
uses, may be an impossibility, but the claims of Espe- 
ranto as a medium of international intercourse among 
Aryan peoples are not inconsiderable. Such is its sim- 
plicity that with only two thousand roots (the greater 
part of them intelligible even to one who knows only 
English) seventy thousand words may be easily formed 

— enough, surely, for every-day purposes. Professor 
Greorge Macloskie, writing in the " North American 
Review," considers the new language a work of genius, 
and takes exception to the late utterances of Professor 
Munsterberg, who, he avers, condemns Esperanto for 
the sins of Volapuk. Dr. Zamenhof's address at the 
recent Esperanto congress is published in the same mun- 
ber of the " Review." The inventor of this tongue is 
an idealist as well as a practical linguist. He hopes 
great things for humanity from the spread of Espe- 
ranto: it will help to break down international barriers 
and to promote " brotherhood and justice among man- 
kind." Even so cool a head as Professor Wilhelm 
Ostwald has caught the enthusiasm. Speaking at the 
Aberdeen University celebration last September, he 
regretted the existing diversity of tongues as a hin- 
drance to international peace, and added: "I express 
my strong conviction that this problem is on the way of 
being solved by means of an international auxiliary 
language." 

Hero-worship on the wane is the lament wafted 
to our ears from across the water. Shelley's notebooks 

— three little leather-covered memorandum books given 
by the poet's widow to Sir Percy Shelley, and by him to 
the late Dr. Richard Garnett — have been suffered to 
pass under the auctioneer's hammer in London to a rich 
American bibliophile, for $15,000. In Scotland Lord 
Rosebery has been trying, with no very brilliant success, 
to persuade the canny Caledonians to " chip in " and 
save the " Auld Brig o' Ayr " immortalized by Robert 
Burns — before some odious American multimillionare 



shall appear on the scene and have the stones of the 
bridge numbered and carried off, to be built up again in 
his own back-yard. Another Scotchman whom it was 
some time ago proposed to honor with a monument in 
his native land is the great hero- worshipper himself; for 
him a replica of the Chelsea statue was suggested, but at 
last accounts the originators of this plan were disposed 
to accept with thanks enough money to pay for a me- 
dallion portrait. As a gratifying exception to the rule, 
the preservation of the Coleridge cottage at Nether 
Stowey by an English society with a characteristically 
long name (The National Trust for the Preservation of 
Places of Natural Beauty and Historical Interest) seems 
now not imlikely to become an assured fact. 
• « . 

The right to publish private letters has re- 
cently become an interesting subject of discussion in 
England. A late decision of the Court of Appeal, 
whereby the right to publish certain letters of Charles 
Lamb was declared to reside with their present pos- 
sessor or his agent, seems to entitle, in England, the 
receiver of letters to publish them without the consent 
of the writer, or of his executor or other legal represen- 
tative if he be dead. This, in the opinion of many, is a 
perilous state of affairs, and calls for legislative cor- 
rection. The persons most interested in the correspon- 
dence of a recently deceased celebrity are, manifestly, 
the surviving relatives and near friends, and not, in all 
cases, the recipients of the letters, or even the literary 
executor; but the famUy and friends have at present 
no legal right to interfere with the publication of post- 
humous matter of this sort. Will the frankness and 
freedom of friendly correspondence suffer from all this 
something like a cold chill, and lose the charm of its 
careless informality? 

The death of Ferdinand Brunetiere is appro- 
priately noticed in a black-bordered leaflet inserted, 
evidently at the last moment, in the mid-December 
Revue des Deux Mondes, with which the eminent littera- 
teur was so long connected as contributor and editor. 
The obituary notice, from the pen of M. Paul Leroy- 
Beaulieu, president of the magazine's supervisory coun- 
cil, is merely preliminary to a longer and more studied 
article that is soon to follow. The Revue justly prides 
itself on havmg extended to Brunetifere the hospitality 
of its pages when he was poor and friendless, and on 
having retained and honored him until his death. That 
even in bodily suffering and decay he could still handle 
with an assured touch and a calm judgment the literary 
questions and contemporary problems that interested 
him, was evidenced by his latest contributions to the 
magazine which he conducted, and whose very last 
number of the year dying with himself was made up 

under his direction. 

... 

Record prices t-OR rare books, so far as this 
country is concerned, were paid in the year just closed 
— another proof of commercial prosperity, if not of 
increased interest in literature. It was at Libbie's, 
in Boston, that the highest price for a single volume 
(Poe's " Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems," 
Baltimore, 1829) and also for a lot (the four folios of 
Shakespeare, first and third imperfect) was paid at 
public auction. The Poe brought $1560, the Shake- 
speare $8950. An uncut copy of the former sold in 
1901 for $1300, and a perfect set of the latter realized 
£10,000 at private sale in 1905.

The" Author of " Ben-Hur." * 



It is nearly a twelvemonth since General Lew 
Wallace died, in his seventy-eighth year. A 
full account of his long and remarkably eventful 
life, down to the summer of 1864, had been 
written by him in the preceding eight or nine 
years ; and this autobiography his widow, 
assisted by a friend. Miss Mary H. Krout, now 
edits, with a continuation of the narrative. The 
whole is published in two octavo volumes of five 
hundred pages each, the final two hundred being 
the continuation. Portraits, facsimile letters, 
maps, and other illustrative matter, are amply 
provided, and the result is a work of more than 
ordinary interest, especially to the veterans of 
our great Civil War and to the survivors of the 
Mexican conflict. This earlier war takes up a 
hundred pages of the book, while the later one 
fills the last half of the first volume and two- 
thirds of the second. Besides being spirited 
and well written, this military narrative throws 
light on several matters of historic controversy. 

The pages devoted to the author's early lit- 
erary aspirations and activity, and those describ- 
ing his rise and progress as a lawyer, a politician, 
and a diplomat, are thus cut down to compara- 
tively small proportions ; but this smaller sec- 
tion of the whole, especially the fraction of it 
that deals with the writer's literary interests, 
may perhaps best be more particularly consid- 
ered in this review. The general outline of the 
author's public life is too familiar, or at least 
too easily accessible in books of reference, to 
detain us here. What is less known is his early 
indication of artistic talent, which, combined 
with an equally early and pronounced passion 
for the paraphernalia of armed encounter — a 
passion nourished by the Black Hawk War then 
in progress — resulted in a series of battle- 
pictures such as by no means every boy could 
have drawn. Two of these spirited sketches are 
reproduced in the opening pages of the book. 
A fondness for poetry and romance, as for lit- 
erature generally ; a love of nature, especially 
of rivers, with an incurable tendency to play 
truant from sunrise to sunset ; and a delight in 
public oratory, whether set off by the imposing 
surroundings of a law-court or by the more 
turbulent accompaniments of a political gather- 
ing — these youtlaful likings and affinities fore- 
shadow the varied pursuits and achievements

of the grown man. His education and shaping 
were largely his own. Though the son of one 
who rose to be governor of liis state (Indiana) 
and was afterward sent to Congress, young 
Wallace's early environment was of the rudest, 
and the untimely death of his mother removed 
one of the few gentler influences that had soft- 
ened its asperities. Although he goes so far as 
to attribute wholly to his wife " what of success 
has come to me, all that I am, in fact," a reser- 
vation must be made in favor of the mother, to 
whom he also pays tribute as follows : 

" My mother, the Esther French Test already men- 
tioned, died in her twenty-seventh year, leaving me so 
young that her sweet motherliness is a clearer impres- 
sion on my mind than either her qualities or her appear- 
ance. Of the latter, all I can now recall are her eyes, 
large, sparkling, and deeply brown. They follow me 
yet. Indeed, through my seventy years there has never 
been a day so bright or a night so dark that, upon re- 
currence of the thought of them, I have been xmable to 
see them seeing me." 

The reminiscences of a rejected suitor supply us 
with details of her beauty and grace, the charm 
of her innocent coquetry, her fondness for dan- 
cing, and with it all her Puritan devoutness, 
her goodness and charity. The father too 
deserves more than a passing word. He had a 
fine taste in literature and could render effec- 
tively the productions of the great writers. A 
description is given of one of these family read- 
ings, of rare occurrence in summer, " rather 
sovereign graces reserved for winter evenings," 
when solemn preparation was made by piling 
high the old-fashioned fireplace with fuel, and 
putting in place the table, lamp, and easy chair. 
Then at last " we were ready ; so was the reader." 

" My father had a face complementary of a beautiful 
head. A more serviceable voice for the carriage of 
delicate feeling I never heard. It was of all the mid- 
dle tones, and remarkably sensitive to the touch of the 
thought to be rendered. ... He delighted, for ex- 
ample, in the Essays of Elia ; Shakespeare and Milton 
he regarded with a kind of awe. It was from him 
I first had the full effects of " The Lay of the Last 
Minstrel " and " Childe Harold." He fixed my standard 
of pulpit eloquence by the sermons of Dr. Chalmers, 
Robert Hall, Bossuet, and Bourdaloue. Once he gave 
an evening to Thucydides, and so powerful was his ren- 
dition of the retreat of the Athenians from Syracuse 
that it has since been one of my exemplars in historical 
writing." 

Another pen-portrait must be given. Lawyer 
Wallace and his friend Daniel W. Voorhees — 
both of them recently established in their pro- 
fession at Coving-ton, Indiana — had taken 
advantage of a leisure day to hire a horse and 
buggy and drive to Danville, Illinois, where 
court was in session. In the tavern bar-room, 
after supper, sat three of the best story-tellers

of Indiana, " swapping anecdotes " with two 
" famous lawyers and yarn-spinners of Illinois." 
" The criss-crossing went on till midnight, and for a 
long time it might not be said whether Illinois or 
Indiana was ahead. There was one of the contestants, 
however, who arrested my attention early, partly by his 
stories, partly by his appearance. . . . His hair was 
thick, coarse, and defiant; it stood out in every direc- 
tion. His features were massive, nose long, eyebrows 
protrusive, mouth large, cheeks hollow, eyes gray and 
always responsive to the humor. He smiled all the 
time, but never once did he laugh outright. His hands 
were large, his arms slender and disproportionately long. 
His legs were a wonder, particularly when he was in 
narration ; he kept crossing and uncrossing them ; some- 
times it actually seemed he was trying to tie them into 
a bow-knot. His dress was more than plain; no part 
of it fit him. . . . About midnight his competitors were 
disposed to give in; either their stores were exhausted, 
or they were tacitly conceding him the crown. From 
answering them story for story, he gave them two or 
three to their one. At last he took the floor and held 
it. And looking back I am now convinced that he 
frequently invented his replications ; which is saying he 
possessed a marvellous gift of improvisation. Such was 
Abraham Lincoln." 

Other reminiscences of Lincoln occur later. It 
was in one of the debates with Douglas that the 
author first heard him address a large audience. 
After the first ten minutes all inclination to 
laugh at the orator's grotesque appearance 
vanished. " He was getting hold of me," says 
the writer. " The pleasantry, the sincerity, the 
confidence, the amazingly original way of put- 
ting things, and the simple, unrestrained man- 
ner withal, were doing their perfect work ; and 
then and there I dropped an old theory, that 
to be a speaker one must needs be graceful and 
handsome." More follows, graphically descrip- 
tive of this memorable debate. 

Mrs. Wallace has inserted a pen-picture, 
from an early friend of her husband, of his ap- 
pearance at the age of twenty-one. To complete 
this series of portraits, it may be well to give 
this one also. It is from an old letter of Miss 
Mary Clemmer (afterwards the brilliant news- 
paper correspondent and author, Mary Clemmer 
Ames). 

" He is fashioned of the refined clay of which nature 
is most sparing, nearly six feet high, perfectly straight, 
with a fine fibred frame all nerve and muscle, and so 
thin he cannot weigh more than a hundred and thirty 
pomids. He has profuse black hair, a dark, beautiful 
face, correct in every line, keen, black eyes deeply set, 
with a glance that on occasion may cut like fine steel 
Black beard and mustache conceal the firm mouth and 
chin. His modest, quiet manner is the only amende that 
can be made for being so handsome. In a crowd any- 
where you would single him out as a king of men. 
Marked for action rather than words, he is habitually 
reticent, yet when the time comes for speech is ready 
with eloquent words, given with a voice at once sweet 



and strong. A man of convictions, earnest in every 
nerve of his being, intensely earnest." 

Wallace's early writing of "The Fair God " 
under the immediate suggestion of Prescott's 
"Conquest of Mexico," with no thought of 
printing, and its resurrection and publication 
long afterward, make a good story, but cannot 
here be retold. One incident, however, con- 
nected with the book is too amusing to be passed 
by. A smooth-tongued gentleman, announcing 
himself as agent for a well-known New York 
publishing house, approached the young lawyer, 
engaged him in conversation on literary matters, 
incidentally betrayed a wonderful and enviable 
intimacy with aU the foremost writers of the 
day, then veered off to the subject of competi- 
tion among publishers, indicated the earnest 
desire of his house to hunt up and bring forward 
hidden talent, and finally begged to see the un- 
published novel which Mr. Wallace was known 
to have in his desk. Then followed an exami- 
nation of the manuscript, enthusiastic praises of 
its merits, a promise to recommend it warmly 
for publication, and, last of all, a courteous 
demand of a fee (fifteen dollars) for services 
rendered. The fee was cheerfully paid, and the 
velvet- voiced gentleman departed. One knows 
not which to admire more, the ingenuity and 
skill of the self-styled agent or the frankness of 
his victim in telling the story. 

The Mexican War, whose outbreak the young 
Indiana law-student eagerly awaited, that he 
might be among the first volunteers to hasten 
to the front, he in his sober maturity does not 
hesitate to pronounce justifiable. Despite much 
inglorious hardship endured by him in a wretch- 
edly misanitary camp at the mouth of the Rio 
Grande, where hundreds died of a loathsome 
disease, and despite his smallness of opportunity 
to smell gunpowder, he unfalteringly declares, 
" From that day to this I have never regretted 
the year left behind me as a soldier in Mexico ; 
neither have I at any time since been troubled 
with a qualm about the propriety even to right- 
eousness of the war." In his detailed account 
of his Civil War experiences — a military his- 
tory to be placed beside Grant's and Sherman's 
and Sheridan's similar reminiscences — the 
author gives a verbatim report (published prob- 
ably for the first time) of the findings of the 
commission that inquired into the conduct of 
the army under Buell in Kentucky and Ten- 
nessee. Wallace, then a Major General, pre- 
sided at the sessions of this commission. His 
report, forwarded to Washington, was lost or 
stolen ; but luckily he had kept a copy, and this

copy is now printed. Its general tenor, as has 
long been known, was not favorable to Buell. 

The book is excellent reading, especially for 
those fond of military history. Brisk and vivid 
in style, it has, if one may say so without un- 
kindness, the swing and vigor of " a soul con- 
fident in itself | almost] to the superlative of 
vanity " — as the author writes in description 
of his yoimg manhood. Even Mrs. Wallace's 
continuation of the narrative is so largely com- 
posed of letters and other matter from her 
husband's pen — including a reprint from " The 
Youth's Companion " of " How I Came to Write 
Ben-Hur^' — that we hardly notice the transi- 
tion. Errors of haste or negligence, including 
even lapses in grammar, and other more delib- 
erate faults, can be found by the critical ; but 
their enumeration would be a thankless task, 
and, now that the author is no longer living to 
profit by a friendly word of criticism, a motive- 
less one. Let the last word, then, be one of 
praise for this apparently faithful record ; for, 
as Carlyle has said in words now familiar to 
many, " There is no life of a man, faithfully re- 
corded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed 
or unrhymed." Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Teaching op El,ementarx 
Economics.* 



Few fields of college and university activity 
have had so remarkable a development in Amer- 
ica during the last two decades as that enjoyed 
by the department 'of Economics. Although 
Political Economy had for years prior to 1885 
held a place in the currictda of our colleges and 
universities, it was seldom pursued for more 
than one term, and its teaching usually devolved 
upon the professor of history, or more likely 
upon the president, who in addition to his ad- 
ministrative duties gave instruction in this sub- 
ject and in " Moral Philosophy " to the college 
seniors. Rarely indeed was the institution to 
be found which had the work in Political Econ- 
omy organized as a separate department. 

The character of the teaching in this subject 
was almost, if not quite, as backward as the 
organization of the work. The subject of Eco- 
nomic Theory was in all essentials the same as 
it had been left by Kicardo, MiU, and Senior. 
The cost theory of Value, the abstinence theory 
of Interest, the Wage-fund theory, all had 

•Principles of Economics. With Special Reference to 
American Conditions. By Edwin R. A. Seligman. New York : 
Longmans, Green, & Co. 



been subjected to little modification by the ep- 
igones who undertook to re-write and expound 
the doctrines of the masters. The discussion 
of most practical problems was equally ready- 
made. Only the subject of Protection awakened 
keen controversy, and here the teaching was that 
of the doctrinaire. The student might choose be- 
tween the free-trade doctrines of Sumner, Perry, 
and Wayland, or the protectionism of Bowen 
and Thompson ; there was no middle ground. 
Bimetallism received some attention, and Tax- 
ation was not wholly neglected. The " trust " 
question had not yet begun to loom big on the 
horizon, trade-unionism was merely noticed as 
a desperate device of laborers to overthrow the 
laws of God and man, and railway rates and 
discriminations perplexed the shippers and the 
legislators more than they did the economic 
philosophers. 

In 1885 the American Economic Association 
was founded by a small body of young men who 
had for the most part received their training in 
Germany, and who on their return to America 
placed themselves on record as opposed to the 
traditional methods of teaching Political Econ- 
omy then current in our coUeges. It is chiefly 
the work of these men which has made itself felt 
in the later-day instruction in economic science. 
There is no place within the limits of this re- 
view to discuss the ways in which the work of 
these men has modified the older doctrines and 
methods. This much, however, may be said : 
the teaching of Economics has ceased to be the 
work of doctrinaires, and is now almost every- 
where pursued according to the same methods 
tliat have proved so fruitful in the domain of the 
physical and natural sciences. 

This change in the methods of instruction has 
met with a hearty response on the part of both 
the general public and the student body. Peo- 
ple are boimd to become interested in a subject 
which occupies the attention of most men during 
the majority of their waking hours, and men of 
affairs welcome an analysis of business relations 
and institutions based upon historical research 
and statistical observation. There is abundant 
evidence of the growing confidence which busi- 
ness men and statesmen feel in the methods 
and conclusions of economic investigators and 
teachers. In all branches of the government 
service there is a pronounced tendency to utilize 
the services of men trained in the universities to 
conduct thorough and elaborate investigations 
into the workings of business institutions ; while 
within the university the latest development of 
the field of Economics is that which has been

prompted by the demands of the business world, 
viz., the expansion of the work so as to include 
instruction in accountancy, banking, commercial 
geography, commercial and industrial organi- 
zation, corporation finance, insurance, transpor- 
tation, etc., for the purpose of training men for 
administrative positions in the industrial world. 
If we consider the fifteen or twenty leading 
universities in the country where the elective 
system has made most headway, we shall find 
that the elections within this department usually 
equal, if they do not exceed, those of any other 
department. Such an interest in the subject 
would not appear, were it not for the feeling 
that instruction in it is capable of yielding infor- 
mation which has for its possessors great practi- 
cal importance. 

The expansion of the field of Economics and 
the change in the mode of treating its subject- 
matter covdd not but react upon the pedagogical 
methods of the instructors. For some years after 
the revival of interest in the " dismal science " 
— now no longer dismal — the method of teach- 
ing was mainly by lectures. This was partly 
due to the fact that the text-books in existence 
were little more than re-statements of the doc- 
trines of the classical economist ; and, as already 
stated, these doctrines did not commend them- 
selves to the yoimger school. Another consid- 
eration which led to the selection of the lecture 
method was the fact that the majority of these 
younger teachers had been trained in the German 
universities and were desirous of introducing 
German pedagogical methods into this country. 
Experience showed, however, that the " pouring 
in " process did not succeed well with the aver- 
age undergraduate whose mind may be likened 
to a sieve rather than to a mould. The weak- 
ness of the lecture method became more appar- 
ent as the growth of the elective system pro- 
ceeded, and the ambition to increase the number 
and the size of the classes led to the gradual 
admission into the courses in Economics, first 
of the juniors, then of sophomores, and even in 
some cases of freshmen. The demand for a 
suitable text-book which should either displace 
the formal lecture or supplement this method of 
instruction made itself felt. The first works 
of this character to present modern views were 
those of the late Francis A. Walker, in many 
respects the most original of American econo- 
mists. These text-books of General Walker 
were weU written and were full of suggestion to 
pupil and teacher. They were produced, how- 
ever, before the more recent theories of Value 
had made their influence felt on this side of the 



water, and as these theories gradually met with 
acceptance the Walker texts were not easily 
reconciled with them. Furthermore, there were 
many points in Walker's theory of Distribution 
— in particular, his residual claimant theory 
of wages — which, while marking a decided 
advance over the older theories, proved unsatis- 
factory to many economists. An English trans- 
lation of one of the earlier editions of Gide's 
" Principles of Political Economy " also met 
much favor for a time, but it too had been writ- 
ten before its author was thoroughly familiar 
with the marginal-utility theory of Value, and 
it represented a very unsatisfactory attempt to 
harmonize the utility and cost theories. Pro- 
fessor Marshall's weighty treatise on Economics 
was abridged for text-book purposes, but it 
covered only a part of the field, and proved 
difficult for many beginners. Professor Ely's 
" Outlines " furnished a clear and concise state- 
ment of economic principles ; and the same may 
be said of Professor Bullock's " Introduction." 
Both of these books were widely used as text- 
books for some years, and are still in use in 
many of the smaller colleges where perhaps only 
one term's work can be given to the elements of 
Economics. In the larger universities, however, 
where it is the custom to give four or five hours 
a week during a semester or even three hours for 
an entire year, these books furnished too brief 
an outline of the subject. Hadley's " Econ- 
omics " served the purpose better, but this 
excellent work possesses some peculiarities of 
arrangement which have seemed to hinder its 
general adoption. 

Within the last two or three years there have 
appeared four text-books prepared with especial 
reference to their use in university classes. A 
new translation of Professor Gide's book, which 
had been largely amplified and given an Ameri- 
can dress by its translator, Professor Veditz, 
and two books written by two of the most bril- 
liant of our younger economists, Professor 
Seager of Columbia and Professor Fetter of 
Cornell, made their appearance about the same 
time. These works were well received and have 
been widely adopted in university classes. The 
last of the four books to leave the publishers is 
that of Professor Seligman of Columbia Uni- 
versity. Professor Seligman is the youngest of 
that group of scholars who, as already men- 
tioned, introduced the historical method of 
treatment of Economics into this country, and 
thus began a new epoch in its teaching and 
investigation. 

The value of any text-book will largely de-

pend upon the teacher who handles it ; and for 
this reason it is impossible to criticise such a 
work in a way which shall do much more than 
reflect the personal judgment of the critic. Of 
Professor Seligman's scholarly abilities in this 
line of work there can be no difference of opin- 
ion. He has long ranked as one of the most 
patient investigators and keenest of critics now 
engaged in this field of knowledge. Having an 
easy command of four or five languages, and 
possessing the largest private library in Econ- 
omics in the world, Professor Seligman has had 
splendid opportunities for becoming familiar 
with economic literature, and these opportunities 
have not been neglected. The advantages of 
his wide reading, probably not equalled by that 
of any other scholar on this side of the Atlantic, 
are in the present work shared with his readers. 
Perhaps the feature which commends it most 
strongly to the teacher is the carefully selected 
and well classified lists of books, periodicals, 
and government documents, which serve as an 
introduction to the book or appear at the head 
of the various chapters. Even the man who is 
pretty familiar with the literature of the sub- 
ject will be grateful for this accurate list of 
authorities and for the brief but pointed com- 
ments which accompany many of the titles. 

In the present reviewer's opinion. Professor 
Seligman's volume is likely to prove of more 
value to the teacher of Economics than to the 
beginner in the subject for whose benefit pri- 
marily it was written. This is not because of 
any lack of clearness or other defects of style. 
It is due rather to the fact that the author has 
attempted to cover too much ground and to 
introduce the student to too great a variety of 
subjects. It is true that a complete compre- 
hension of principles cannot be had without 
considering all their ajjplications and all the 
institutions to which economic activities have 
given rise. This does not necessitate, however, 
introducing a beginner to a piecemeal consid- 
eration of all these subjects in order to furnish 
him an opportunity to get a firm grasp of fun- 
damental notions. In the present work, besides 
the subjects ordinarily covered in elementary 
treatises on Economics and formerly arranged 
under the general headings of Production, Ex- 
change, and Distribution, we have chapters on 
" Economic Law and Method," " The Economic 
Stages," " The Historical Forms of Business 
Enterprises," including a discussion of theories 
concerning the clan and the family, " The De- 
velopment of Economic Thought," " Private 
Property," " Competition," " Freedom," " Pov- 



erty and Progress." As brief statements, these 
chapters are excellently well done ; but in the 
case of most of these subjects it is not possible 
in the space allotted to give to the beginner such 
information as will enable him to comprehend 
the significance of these institutions or the part 
they play in economic life. The most unfortu- 
nate result of their introduction, however, lies 
in the fact that this necessarily curtails the space 
assigned to the treatment of the unsettled prob- 
lems of Economics, and this in turn leads to a 
rather dogmatic treatment of these problems. 
The discussion of the many vital and difficult 
questions which, taken together, constitute the 
so-called " labor problem " is compressed within 
nineteen pages. This means in the case of many 
of these questions only the barest outline. The 
subject of Industrial Cooperation, for example, 
covers less than a page of the text. Professor 
Seligman expects very little from this move- 
ment ; but whatever one's attitude of mind may 
be toward the practical results to be obtained, 
it is at least desirable that enough space shoidd 
be given to the subject to make the student 
realize the high ideal which Cooperation offers 
as a solution of the labor problem. 

The treatment of Credit is too briefly stated 
to be comprehended by a beginner, while the 
discussion of Socialism is almost superficial. In 
some instances, however, this brevity of treat- 
ment has proved conducive to lucidity, as, for 
example, in the case of the discussion of the rate 
of international exchange. The difficult subject 
of Value, fortunately, commands more space 
than is assigned to it in any of the other text- 
books to which we have referred ; not less than 
one hundred pages — one sixth of the book — 
being taken up with its discussion. Nor is this 
a disproportionate emphasis when one takes into 
consideration the fundamental character of the 
subject and its difficulties for beginners. The 
discussion is not only thorough but clear. Espe- 
cially commendable is the section which deals 
with Social Values. It has been the experience 
of the reviewer that most text-book writers have 
failed to make clear to the student the distinc- 
tion between individual and social valuations ; 
or, rather, they do not make clear the fact that 
an individual's valuation of a commodity is 
completely altered whenever it is possible to 
take advantage of other people's valuations of 
the same commodity. 

One of the striking features of the book is 
the large place which is given to the influences 
of the physical and historical environment on 
the economic activities and theories of a people.

Professor Seligman seems to have been influ- 
enced, more than most American economists, by 
the German historical school, though he is no 
blind follower of that school. As a general rule, 
there is no criticism to be passed upon this part 
of the book, but in some instances the author 
seems to have taken an extreme attitude, as 
when he seeks to explain the change from En- 
glish individualism to Australian socialism by 
mere differences in climate. 

Professor Seligman follows closely the lead 
of his colleague, Professor Clark, in his devel- 
opment of the theory of Distribution. Like the 
latter, he seeks to show the universality of the 
law of rent, and the return to each factor in 
production is calcidated according to the yield 
of its final unit employed. While not an un- 
qualified supporter of a protective tariff, the 
author attaches more weight to the arguments 
for protection than most economists have done, 
and he believes that a protective policy has been 
and still is a wise policy for the United States. 
His defense of what has come to be called the 
" dumping policy " of leading American manu- 
facturers, whereby a surplus at home is unloaded 
upon the foreign market at lower prices than 
these goods are sold for at home, is very weak. 
" It does not follow," he says, " that the lower 
foreign prices make the domestic price higher 
than it would otherwise be." But the price is 
certainly higher when a portion of the supply is 
withdi-awn to sell abroad than it would be if it 
were kept at home. It was because the whiskey 
producers coidd not prevent over-production 
during the early '80s that a pool was formed 
for the purpose of selling the surplus abroad in 
order to maintain prices at home. 

Always careful to avoid the criticism of being 
a blind partisan. Professor Seligman does not 
hesitate to declare his position in regard to the 
perplexing problems of the present. His own 
treatment of these problems throughout the 
present work well illustrates the attitude of 
mind which on the closing page of his book he 
urges the student of Economics to take. " The 
economic student, if he is worthy of his calling, 
will proceed without fear or favor ; he will be 
tabooed as a socialist by some, as a minion of 
capital by others, as a dreamer by more. But 
if he preserves his clearness of vision, his open- 
ness of mind, his devotion to truth, and his 
sanity of judgment, the deference paid to his 
views, which is even now beginning to be appar- 
ent, will become more and more pronounced."

Echoes of a Famous IjIterary 
Conflict.* 



In his preface to " The Text of Shakespeare," 
Professor Lounsbury virtually admits that the 
title is a misnomer.. The volume is primarily 
a contribution to the literary history of the 
eighteenth century, and it wiU stand in our 
libraries among the commentaries on Pope. It 
is a long arraignment, based on the most ample 
evidence, of Pope's mystifications and falsifica- 
tions of fact, his cowardly fighting from behind 
masked batteries, his unscrupulous malevolence 
in attack, and his astounding assumption of a 
severe and unassailable morality. " His repu- 
tation as a poet, he asserted, or intimated, was 
but little in his thoughts ; what he desired to be 
considered was a man of virtue " (p. 470). " It 
is my morality only," he wrote to Aaron Hill, 
" that must make me beloved or happy " (ibid.). 

The occasion for this new exposure of Pope's 
" indirect, crook'd ways " is the story of his 
long quarrel with Theobald over the constitu- 
tion of the text of Shakespeare — if that can be 
called a quarrel which consists of unremitting 
and malignant depreciation and calumny on the 
one side, and an almost entire dependence upon 
the plain statement of facts on the other. The 
present volume is an attempt to reverse the 
decision of Pope's case by his enlightened con- 
temporaries, and by aU but experts at the present 
day. The preternatural cleverness of Pope, the 
reverence in which he was held as the first poet 
of his age, the unscrupvdous zeal of his disciples, 
and the tendency of an uncritical public to 
accept as true whatever is rejjeated with suffi- 
cient frequency and emphasis, all contributed to 
bring about a miscarriage of justice. In the 
minds of any intelligent and attentive jury. 
Professor Lounsbury, though he declares that 
he does not hold a brief for Theobald, must be 
considered to have secured a judgment for him, 
though at the eleventh hour. 

The book has, therefore, the additional merit 
of being an attack upon what its author calls, 
not unjustly, " that collection of notions and 
fancies and prejudices and traditional beliefs 
which we dub with the title of literary criticism " 
(p. 485). For it is tmdoubtedly true that the 
current opinion of Theobald, so far as his name 
is known at aU, is the one of Pope's creating. 
Many of his admirable emendations and inter- 
pretations of the text of Shakespeare have been

apjDi-opriated by editors who have depreciated 
t^e man whom they phmdered. His own scru- 
pulosity in giving full credit to anyone from 
whom he took a suggestion has been so effectu- 
ally used against him that, as Professor Louns- 
bury wittily puts it, " anyone who familiarizes 
himself with the practice he pursued, and the 
treatment which he received as a consequence of 
it, will become thoroughly disabused of any 
belief in the truth of the maxim that honesty is 
the best policy" (p. 639). The authoritative 
edition of Pope's works by Elwyn and Court- 
hope says of Theobald : " He was pedantic, 
poor, and somewhat malignant. He had at- 
tempted with equal ill-success original poetry, 
translation, and play- writing ; and had indeed 
no disqualification for the throne of Dulness 
except his insignificance " (vol. iv., p. 27). Yet 
Professor Lounsbury makes it clear that Theo- 
bald was no pedant, unless exact and extensive 
scholarship be pedantry, that he was not poor, 
and that his " malignancy," when compared with 
Pope's, strangely resembles generosity ; that his 
poetic gift was regarded as sufficient to entitle 
him to be considered for the laureateship, and 
that a play, written when he was twenty, was 
performed by the two principal tragedians of 
the time ; and finally, that he was as little en- 
titled to the " bad eminence " to which Pope 
raised him in the original Dunciad as the great 
Bentley himself. Theobald's " childlike confi- 
dence in the fairness of future generations," 
says Professor Lounsbury, " was never born of 
insight " (p. 537), nor was his vmderstanding 
of human nature very acute when he wrote 
of his corrections of Pope's text : " Wherever 
I have the luck to be right in any observa- 
tion, I flatter myself Mr. Pope himself will 
be pleased that Shakespeare receives some 
benefit" (p. 191). But Mr. Pope was not 
pleased. Instead, he prefixed, apparently for 
all time, the epithet " piddling " to Theobald's 
name. 

The story of the quarrel is so interesting an 
illustration of " the amenities of literature " that 
a brief summary of Professor Lounsbury's am- 
ple treatment may perhaps be welcome. In 
1725 appeared Pope s long-heralded edition of 
Shakespeare, about which, as Professor Louns- 
bury remarks, " everything was excellent but 
the editing " (p. 82). Despite his professions. 
Pope had entirely failed to perform the plain 
duties of an editor. He had made no carefid 
collation of the original texts, and indeed had 
so little perception of the value of the First 
Folio as to write, "It is from it that almost 



all the errors of succeeding editions take rise " 
(p. 82). He ignored or suppressed variants, 
he made silent emendations, he neglected to ex- 
plain difficulties in the text, or explained them 
wrongly. His chief contributions of value were 
certain verbal re-arrangements in the interest of 
metre, the addition to the Folio text of many 
lines taken from the quartos, and the elimina- 
tion from the canon of six non-Sliakespearean 
plays that had been included in the Third Folio. 
Even the much-lauded poetical taste displayed 
by Pope as an editor, in which, despite his de- 
fects, he was and still is regarded as supreme, 
did not prevent him from suspecting that " The 
Winter's Tale" and "Love's Labour's Lost" 
were not wholly Shakespeare's work. Theo- 
bald's " Shakespeare Restored : or, a Specimen 
of the many Errors, as well committed, as un- 
amended, by Mr. Pope in his late Edition of 
this Poet," etc., which appeared in 1726, was 
not, therefore, an impertinence. Moreover, says 
Professor Lounsbury, " his treatise surpasses in 
interest and importance any single one of its 
numerous successors " (p. 155). It abounds in 
felicitous and what now seem inevitable emen- 
dations, among them the famous " a babied of 
green fields "; and these emendations are not the 
resvdt of mere conjecture but are supported by 
parallels drawn from other plays. " In short," 
as Professor Lounsbury says, " his method was 
the method of a scholar, and wherever he erred 
it was the error of a scholar, and not of a hap- 
hazard guesser " (p. 160). But one serious error 
he made from which scholarship could not save 
him, — of which, indeed, scholarship was the 
direct cause, — he proved himself to be, as an 
editor of Shakespeare, the manifest superior 
of the leading poet of the age. This would 
probably have been sufficient to gain Pope's 
enmity, which was never merely passive ; but it 
must be granted that Theobald was not inclined 
to depreciate or conceal his superiority to the 
poet in this particular, — a failure, as the sequel 
proved, not more in civility than in discretion. 
For, in 1728, he found hmiself elevated by the 
Dimciad to the very throne of Dulness. He was 
dethroned, to be sure, by the edition of 1743, in 
favor of CoUey Gibber, but this was too late 
for his fame. Thanks to Pope's diligence and 
influence, most of the men whom he stigmatized 
as dimces are to-day regarded as deserving the 
title, and Theobald is no exception to this rule. 
Nevertheless, it shovdd be remembered that, in 
Pope's mind, Bentley too was a dimce, and 
Theobald may well have felt consolation, if not 
pride, in being pilloried with that great scholar.

In 1734, he made a reply to Pope's charges that 
all competent judges must deem sufficient : he 
brought out his own edition of the works of 
Shakespeare, which, for correctness of method 
and felicity of emendation and explanation, was 
as superior to Pope's as to most of its successors. 
Some of Professor Lounsbury's most interesting 
and valuable pages are devoted to illustrations 
of these excellences. The attacks upon Theo- 
bald were not, however, on this account remitted, 
but continued in the pages of " The Grub Street 
Journal," which "owed its conception and crea- 
tion . . . maiidy to Pope " (p. 385). 

Such, in brief, is the history of the great 
" Shakespearean War " of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the outcome of which was far enough from 
being a " Judgment of God." " The fate of 
Theobald," concludes Professor Lounsbury, " is 
likely to remain for all time a striking instance 
in the annals of literary history, of how suc- 
cessfully, to use the words of the author he did 
so much to illustrate, malice can bear down 
truth " (p. 567). 

In style, this volume is delightfully clear and 
entertaining, despite some rather painful lon- 
gueurs. Professor Lounsbury wears his learn- 
ing lightly, and the reader, therefore, feels no 
burden. It is full of the personal touches, 
keenly or blandly satirical, which his readers 
always expect, and in which no American lit- 
erary scholar surpasses him. His luminous and 
personal style should be an example to all who 
practice the difficult art of criticism.

The Tkade Organizations of 
MEDiiEVAL Italy.* 



To the general reader of history, mediaeval 
Florence is the city of Dante and Petrarch, the 
home of the Renaissance, the birthplace of mod- 
ern culture. Early Florentine history is to him 
a long and important chapter in the story of 
European civilization ; from the city on the 
Arno the popular imagination views at the same 
time the splendors of the Athenian past and the 
still grander accomplishments of our own age. 
While it is true that the achievements of Flor- 
ence in the field of intellect constitute her chief 
glory, still her history is not wholly concerned 
with letters and art. Even genius has certain

Illus- 



material wants that somehow must be satisfied. 
The city that first acquainted western Europe 
with the treasures of Greek learning was the 
city that coined the florin. In commerce and 
industry, as well as in matters of culture, Flor- 
ence was for several centuries one of the leading 
centres of Europe. 

The material side of Tuscan history has been 
made the subject of an extended study by Mr. 
Edgcumbe Staley, an enthusiastic student of 
the Florentine past. Mr. Staley's investigations 
make a volume of about six hundred pages ; it 
is provided with a large number of splendid 
illustrations, nearly all of which are reproduc- 
tions of miniatures and are consequently of 
great historic value ; it also contains several 
excellent photographs of buildings and other his- 
toric survivals. The author groups his sources 
under four heads : manuscripts, printed matter, 
letters from authorities and friends, and per- 
sonal knowledge of the city and its people. The 
work is, however, to some extent a compilation 
merely, as the author, instead of making a per- 
sonal examination of the manuscript sources, 
seems to have depended largely on the conclu- 
sions of earlier students. 

There can be no doubt that the intention of 
the publishers was to produce a popular history 
rather than a strictly scientific work. The 
author's intentions are not so clear, though the 
volume closely resembles the popular type in 
many respects. It is not provided with notes 
of any sort, and the literary style is too exu- 
berant to be that of an historian writing pri- 
marily for students. In his opening paragraphs 
the author speaks of the three young sisters 
that were fostered in the vale of Arno, — Art, 
Science, and Literature, — and continues as 
follows : 

" No question ever arose as to whose was the subtlest 
witchery, but each developed charms, distinct and rare, 
yet not outrivalling one the other. With harmonious 
voices blended, and ambrosial tresses mingled, the three 
interlaced their comely arms, and tossing with shapely 
feet the flowing draperies of golden tissue, which softly 
veiled the perfect contours of their beauteous forms, 
they gaily danced along. Their enchanting rhythm was 
the music of the new civilization : — it we know — and 
them — but what of their origin ? whence came they ? 
and who were their forebears ? " 

It would only be doing justice to the author 
to say, however, that rhetorical outbursts like 
the one quoted are not general throughout the 
volume. The spirit of the writer seems in the 
main to be that of the true historian : he quotes 
freely from his sources, and at least aims to be

accurate in his statement of facts. To such an 
extent has he fillecl the work with details of 
all possible sorts, with dates and statistics, with 
Italian words and phrases, with allusions to 
laws and constitutional changes, with lists of 
merchants and bankers, and with other data 
both historic and scientific, that the reading of 
even these beautifully printed pages after a 
time becomes somewhat tedious. The author 
has presented top much of his materials in an 
undigested form : as a popular historian, he 
has not been entirely successfiU. 

The author introduces his subject in two 
chapters of a general nature in which he dis- 
cusses the extent of Florentine commerce and 
the methods of the mediaeval merchant. In the 
first he sketches the rise of Florence from com- 
parative obscurity in the days of Charlemagne 
to the high place that she held seven centuries 
later. " From the twelfth to the sixteenth cen- 
turies Florence easily held the first place in the 
life and work of the known world : she was in 
fact Athens and Rome combined." This pre- 
eminence is ascribed to " accidents of climate, 
geographical position, and pequliarities of race." 
" The cumulative energies of the Florentines 
had their focus in the corporate life of the trade 
associations, and in no other community was the 
guild system so thoroughly developed as it was 
in Florence." The general history of this sys- 
tem is the principal theme of the second chapter. 
Ab to the origin of the guilds, the author be- 
lieves they have been " rightly traced to the 
corporations of merchants and artisans which 
existed in Rome under Numa Pompilius." Ap- 
parently Mr. Staley has no doubts as to the 
existence of that venerable monarch, or the 
credibility of the early traditional accounts of 
him. These corporations were revived in the 
Lombard region in 825, although more than 
two centuries passed before they secured a firm 
footing in Florence. As the years went by and 
the guilds grew in importance they developed an 
elaborate constitution, or rather a type of guild 
government, as the various corporations had 
their own constitutional peculiarities ; of these 
matters the author gives us a fairly clear state- 
ment. In the same connection he also discusses 
the authority , exercised by the guild officials in 
the general government of the city. 

In the course of time the trade organizations 
of Florence came to be grouped into seven 
greater, five intermediate, and nine minor guilds. 
To each of the seven greater guilds the author 
devotes a chapter. First in rank was the cor- 



poration of judges and notaries ; next in impor- 
tance were the dealers in foreign cloth and the 
merchants engaged in the wool trade ; important 
also was the g-uild of bankers and the dealers 
in silk ; the guilds of doctors and apothecaries 
and of furriers and skinners held a somewhat 
lower place, but were still counted among the 
seven. In each case the author tries to famil- 
iarize us not only with the history of the guild, 
but with its work as an organization, with its 
opportunities and its limitations, with its meth- 
ods and its importance at home and abroad. 
We are told how cloth was woven and silk was 
dyed ; how furs were prepared and drugs were 
mixed ; how banks were conducted and lawyers 
were trained. The reader is taken into the 
courts, the counting-house, the apothecary shop, 
the market, and the factory, and in each par- 
ticular place the work is inspected with consid- 
erable care. 

Two chapters are devoted to the five inter- 
mediate guilds : those of the butchers, the black- 
smiths, the shoemakers, the masters of stone 
and wood, and the retail cloth-dealers. Three 
chapters are given to the nine minor trades. The 
same style of treatment is employed throughout, 
though naturally the lesser trades, which were 
of local importance only, are not discussed so 
fully as the gTeater guilds, whose agents and 
representatives were found in every commercial 
centre in the known world. 

It is not likely that very many readers will 
be able to plough through all of the twenty 
chapters of " The Guilds of Florence." Too 
much technical matter has been inserted, and 
the details are often uninteresting and unim- 
portant ; at least they will seem so to all who 
have not made a closer study of the Renaissance 
period. But no one with any interest in the 
general subject can afford to miss the last hun- 
dred pages of the book, in which the author 
treats such matters as the market, the streets, 
the squares, and the bridges ; the religion, the 
patronage, and the charity of the guilds; and 
the wealth and power of the great Tuscan city. 
In these pages, as well as elsewhere in the work, 
the reader is given a close view of Florentine 
life, and he cannot fail to understand the later 
middle ages better from having read them. No 
doubt the author's enthusiasm has led him at 
times to employ strong and vivid colors ; but 
the Florentine student can hardly avoid being 
enthusiastic, and the world understands and 
judges accordingly.

JOURNEYINGS IN COVETED IjANDS.* 

Amidst the almost numberless books of travel, 
there are some of the better sort that rise above the 
mere interest of commonplace descriptions and the 
ordinary experiences of the traveller. They awaken 
in us a lively sense of the untried and the unknown ; 
they quicken our minds and arouse our emotions by 
the evidences of energy, self-reliance, foresight and 
heroism which they display. As long as there 
remains an unexplored foot of ground, or an uncon- 
quered race, so long will mankind feel an absorbing 
interest in books which depict vividly man's con- 
quests over man as well as over the obstacles of 
nature. The books in our present group, dealing 
with exploration and travel in little known or mys- 
terious regions of the Far East and the Near East, 
satisfy this higher interest, and present many engag- 
ing racial, religious, and political problems for our 
consideration. 

Lieutenant - Colonel Waddell's volume entitled 
" Lhasa and Its Mysteries " tells the story of the 
Younghusband Mission, in 1903-04, to Lhasa, the 
sacred city of the Tibetans. In a graphic and lucid 
style it portrays the strange life and strange religion 
of a people who have been but recently introduced 
to the world. Colonel Waddell's account of his first 
sight of this wonderful place is a good example of 
the impressionistic method of travel-writing. 

" The first glimpse of the sacred metropolis is dramatic 
in its suddenness. As if to screen the holy capital from view 
tmtil the last moment, Nature has interposed a long curtain 
of rock which stretches across between the two bold guardian 
hills of Potala and the Iron Mountain. . . . The vista which 
then flashes up before the eyes is a vast and entrancing 
panorama. On the left is the front view of the Dalai Lama's 
palace, which faces the east, and is now seen to be a mass of 
lofty buildings covering the hillside — here about 300 feet 
high — from top to bottom with its terraces of many-storied 
and many-windowed houses and buttressed masonry, battle- 
ments, and retaining walls, many of them 60 feet high, and 
forming a gigantic building of stately architectural propor- 
tions on the most picturesque of craggy sites. The central 
cluster of buildings, crowning the summit and resplendent 
with its five golden pavilions on its roof, was of a dull crim- 
son, that gives it the name of the ' Red Palace,' whilst those 
on the other flank were of dazzling white ; and the great 
stairway on each side, leading down to the chief entrance and 
gardens below, zig-zagging outwards to enclose a diamond- 
shaped design, recalled a similar one at the summer palace 
of Peking. A mysterious effect was given to the central 
portion of the building by long curtains of dark purple yak- 
hair cloth which draped the verandahs, to protect the frescoes 
from the rain and sun, but which seemed to muffle the rooms 
in scenery." 

Of the thirty thousand people living in the vicinity 
of this splendor, two-thirds are monks. Although 
in a state of miserable poverty and isolation, they 
have much of the human in them ; they are given to

games, sports, sacred theatrical performances, and 
have an inordinate love of jewelry. There are but 
few children and few old people among them, the 
rigorous climate permitting only the survival of the 
strongest. The greatest interest that Colonel Wad- 
dell found in this city of the Great Buddha was 
connected with the religious rites and ceremonies of 
the monks and the explorations among the scrupu- 
lously guarded secret places of the great palace. 
Here the author is most impressive, and does much 
toward lifting the veil that has so long hung over 
the mysteries of Lhasa. 

The connection between the book just noticed and 
the one entitled "Western Tibet and the British 
Borderland," by Mr. Charles A. Sherring, is more 
intimate than at first appears. That the treaty of 
Lhasa, consummated by the Younghusband mission, 
marked a new era in the political and commercial 
relations between Tibet and India is evident from 
the cordiality and friendship extended by the native 
officials of Western Tibet, or Nari, toward the mem- 
bers of Mr. Sherring's mission. This mission, which 
was sent into Nari for the purpose of inquiring into 
the commercial possibilities of that little-known 
country, met with a friendliness hitherto unknown. 
Its connection with the mission described in Colonel 
Waddell's book is thus explained by Mr. Sherring : 

" These officials of ' The Forbidden Land ' were at first a 
little anxious to cast a veil of mystery over things generally, 
and especially over all matters religious ; and it was not for 
us to intrude where we were not wanted. But when the 
Jongpen came to our camp another day I took Waddell's 
' Lhasa and Its Mysteries ' and systematically took him 
through all the photos, pictures of persons, officials, temples, 
and all the most sacred spots, and the most private details of 
the highest functionaries. . . . When he had seen pictures 
of all that used to be so secret and mysterious in Lhasa, 
there was, in the words of Holy Scriptures, ' no spirit left 
in him.' " 

Mr. Sherring asserts that "the concessions that 
have been obtained by the treaty at Lhasa in regard 
to Gartok [the capital of Western Tibet] are of 
greater importance to the native subjects of His 
Majesty than the whole of the concessions in 
Eastern Tibet. By far the larger part of the popu- 
lation of India is composed of Hindus, who are not 
traders or miners, to whom wool and borax do not 
appeal. . . . But the Hindu is first and foremost 
a devotee, and to him the claims of this religion 
incomparably outweigh all else that is secular." 
Hence this treaty, which permits free ingress into 
Tibet, invites the Hindu to make pilgrimages to 
holy Kailas and to other equally sacred slu-ines in 
Western Tibet. Out of these pilgrimages may come, 
so thinks the author, an increase in commerce. But 
if Mr. Sherring's own descriptions of Western Tibet 
are to be taken as evidence, it will be a long time 
before that country will be productive enough to 
repay commercial encouragement. Surrounded by 
rugged mountains, with a scanty population living 
on the wide wind-swept and waterless plateaux, and 
with an extreme elevation. Western Tibet offers lit- 
tle inducement to the trader. There is, to be sure,

gold in the mountains, but the physical difficulties 
are too great to mine it with profit. For these rea- 
sons it will probably remain, for a long time at least, 
only a dwelling-place of the Hindu gods. The best 
parts of Mr. Sherring's volume are the chapters 
devoted to the legends and myths of the natives, 
especially the Bhotia tribes of the frontier, and to 
the quaint customs and manners of the British 
Borderland. Here Mr. Sherring, who has for some 
years been Deputy Commissioner of Almora, is 
more at home than he is at Tibet, and he knows his 
subject so thoroughly that he writes with more 
fulness and freedom than when discussing the pos- 
sibilities of Nari. Dr. T. G. Longstaff, who accom- 
panied the author on his journey, contributes an 
account of a week's climb on Gurla Mandhata, the 
highest mountain in Western Tibet. Like nearly 
all recent books on Tibet, this volume is exceedingly 
attractive in its make-up : there is an abundance of 
good pictures and excellent maps — features that 
no doubt suggest the importance of Tibet to stay-at- 
home Britishers. 

The literature of Tibet has grown to large pro- 
portions in the past few years, and the imme- 
diate interest in the Tibetan situation is sufficiently 
acute to demand a handbook which will serve both 
as an introduction to and a summary of the various 
expeditions and travels, and of the geographical 
and political features of that well-nigh impregnable 
land. Such a book is " Tibet the Mysterious," by 
Colonel Sir Thomas H. Holdich. Colonel Holdich, 
although not an explorer or traveller in Tibet, has 
made an exhaustive investigation of all the litera- 
ture relating to that country, and has summarized 
his studies in an accurate and systematic manner. 
For those who wish to plunge in medias res con- 
cerning Tibet, his book will be most acceptable. 
The book opens with a description of the geo- 
graphical situation of Tibet. With the excellent 
map of the country before him, the reader can 
readily understand the various routes which open 
the way to the " roof of the world." By far the 
most interesting and valuable part of the book is the 
summary of the classics of Tibetan adventure and 
exploration. All these expeditions — from the time 
of the earliest Mongolian invasion, the eighteenth- 
century explorations by the monks, the mission of 
the Englishman Bogle, Thomas Manning's visit to 
Tibet and Lhasa, Moorcroft's mysterious attempt. 
Hue and Gabet's journey, and the more modern at- 
tempts of Rockhill, Prjevalski, Needham, Chandra 
Das, Wellby, Bower, Littledale, Bonvalot, Sven 
Hedin, Ryder, Rawling, and Younghusband — are 
chronologically described and amply examined for 
historical, geographical, political, and ethnological 
data. With Lhasa itself, however, the book has 
little to do. "It is intended to illustrate to some 
extent the sequence of exploration in that great 
wilderness of stony and inhospitable altitudes which 
lie far beyond Lhasa." While Colonel Holdich 
does not pose as a commercial prophet, he too, in 
agreement with Messrs. Waddell and Sherring, 



holds forth the tantalizing bait of the great wealth 
of gold which lies so near the surface in many parts 
of Tibet. We note an easily corrected error on page 
102, where the author says that Bogle's Mission 
returned from Tibet in 1874, — the correct date 
being 1784. He evidently accepts the story that 
Moorcroft reached Lhasa and lived there for some 
time before his death in the first quarter of the last 
century ; but it should be remembered that the story 
is founded on circumstantial evidence. His assertion 
that " the Tibetan men and women never wash their 
faces " is contradicted by Colonel Waddell, who tells 
about a Saturnalian feast where the women washed 
their faces, revealing their rosy cheeks. These minor 
errors, however, detract but little from the otherwise 
scholarly work of the author, which will be held in 
high esteem as a general reference-book for the his- 
tory of exploration and travel in Tibet. 

One need not go to the Far East, however, to 
find the spirit of mystery. The Near East — in the 
Balkans — presents a politico-religious problem as 
difficult as may be foimd anywhere in the world. 
Mr. John Foster Eraser, an English newspaper cor- 
respondent, is one of the most recent travellers in 
that section of Europe, and his book entitled " Pic- 
tures from the Balkans " intensifies the general opin- 
ion that some sort of interference must be brought 
about to stop Turkish misgovernment on the one 
hand and the internal dissension of the Balkan 
States on the other. Mr. Eraser went through the 
country, from Belgrade to Sofia, to Plevna, Tirnova, 
Philippolis,to Adrianople, thence southward through 
the ill-defined boundaries of Macedonia to Salonika, 
to Monastir, Ochrida, Elbasan, and Berat, and then 
northward to Uskup, and departed from the Balkans 
on the line he had entered. Montenegro was not 
visited. The keynote to the book is struck in the 
opening paragraph : 

"Riding in Macedonia, I passed the village of Orovsji. 
The inhabitants had just buried seven Bulgarians and four 
Turkish soldiers who had killed each other the previous day. 
Otherwise all was quiet." 
Near the close of the book we read : 

" Everybody is jolly. Murder is so commonplace that it 
arouses no shudder. In the night is the little bark of a 
pistol, a shriek, a clatter of feet. ' Hello ! somebody killed ! ' 
That is all." 

These truly picaresque descriptions are indicative 
of Mr. Eraser's style and tone. But in describing 
a land where democracy and aristocracy are in a 
death-grapple, where religion and bloodshed are 
synonymous terms, where " natives occasionally die 
from disease, but generally from differences of 
opinion," and where the Powers are playing the part 
of hungry vultures waiting for the time of feasting, 
it is permissible for an author to be picturesque, 
cynical, and pessimistic, — especially if he be a 
European. When the real struggle comes in the 
Balkans, it will be precipitated, asserts Mr. Eraser, 
by the dour, sullen, stolid, unimaginative, unsenti- 
mental, but hard-working, plodding, and ambitious 
Bulgarians, who, he thinks, will prevail in the con- 
test. But when Bulgaria acquires the fruits of her

energy and victory over Turkey, then will come the 
tug of war among the European Powers ; for neither 
Austria nor Russia nor Germany, nor perhaps Italy, 
will acquiesce in the creation of another Power in 
the Near East. And when this political Ragnarok 
is fought out to the bitter end, says Mr. Eraser, 
Germany, in the event of the defeat of Turkey, 
expects to be the Power that will subjugate the 
rivals. On the other hand, if Turkish arms should 
prevail, Germany will demand as her price for aid- 
ing Tm-key, first concessions, then protectorates, 
then possessions. The only glimmer of hope for the 
Balkan States lies in the great dream of perfection 
— a Balkan Confederation with the Turks a party 
to the confederation. Mr. Eraser's pictures of the 
Balkans are in oscuro — so much so that two of the 
illustrations which reveal horrible scenes are printed 
on leaves provided with perforations, that they may 
he easily torn from the book by squeamish readers. 
Mr. Eraser adds nothing particularly new to our 
knowledge of affairs in the Balkans, and for this 
reason we wish he had given us more chapters simi- 
lar to his pleasing and diverting ones entitled " The 
Rose Garden of Europe " (meaning thereby the rose 
plantations near Kasanlik) and "His Majesty's 
Representative," a description of a British consulate 
in the Balkans. jj. E. Coblentz. 



Briefs on Ne^v Books. 



Education, - Professor Home's new book on " The 
is it a science Psychological Principles of Educa- 
oranartf tion " (MacmiUan) contains much 

that is of uncommon value and significance. It is 
unfortunate that the first part of the book consists 
of a discussion of the somewhat worn question, " Is 
there a Science of Education?" and adds nothing 
of importance to the debate, falling into the common 
error of confusing the question of the existence or 
possibility of scientific study of education with that 
of the existence of a science of education. The 
existence of a science of education does not dejjend 
upon the methods of educational study, but upon the 
question whether education constitutes an independ- 
ent and intrinsically unitary body of knowledge 
such as to form the groundwork of a science. We 
believe this question must be answered in the nega- 
tive ; nor is the dignity and importance of education 
one whit lessened by such a conclusion, — indeed, 
its place is rather elevated by the belief that it is 
not a science, but a great life-art, ministered to by 
a circle of auxiliary sciences. The very question 
with which Professor Home's discussion opens is 
damaging evidence : " Is there a science of educat- 
inff?" (page 3). If so, why not a science of box- 
ing, or any other indubitable art ? The conception 
of normative science falls into confusion in that the 
normative is declared to be based upon the descrip- 
tive. "The best in the descriptive," we read, "is 
the basis for the normative" (page 17). But how 



can we have any knowledge of what is best without 
first possessing the norms ? Again, we are told that 
universal validity is not one of the inalienable char- 
acteristics of science (page 9). On the contrary, 
universal validity is just the one characteristic that 
marks the truth for which science strives ; whereas, 
as Dr. Home agrees, the knowledge at which edu- 
cation aims is relative and changing. The fact that 
both science and the arts must be always content 
with approximations does not affect the fundamental 
difference in their ideals. The definition of " con- 
cept" in Chapter XII. wavers perceptibly. First 
we read, " Conception is the knowledge of general 
objects " (page 155) ; on the next page, " We can 
now have a concept of the John Smith we perceived 
on the street." What we have in this case is of 
course a memory ima(/e, — or, in the better and more 
recent phrase, a centrally excited perception. The 
real strength of Dr. Home's book is found in its 
treatment of emotional, moral, and religious educa- 
tion ; these vital subjects are handled with breadth, 
warmth, and frankness, and with an unusually full 
comprehension of their supreme importance. Par- 
ticularly refreshing is the emphasis laid upon aesthetic 
culture, in Chapter XX.; the author reproves our 
neglect, in these industrial days, of the education of 
those powers of higher appreciation which the Greeks 
so well knew how to value and to nourish. Our only 
disagreement with the author would be that he does 
not go far enougli, either in the scope of the field or in 
the appraisal of its value for economic, social, and eth- 
ical development. But he has taken a commendable 
step in the right direction. The style of the book 
is clear, simple, straightforward ; we have not found 
an obscure or ambiguous sentence. But why should 
any educated man, even an American, say mad 
when he means angry (pages 220 and 224). 

Aftermath of ^^^- ^^^.^^ Preston Stearns's "Life 
the Hawthorne and Genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne " 
centenary. (Lippincott) has Somewhat the air 

of a belated contribution to the Hawthorne centen- 
nial literature. Perhaps its length and its fulness 
of detail may partly explain its tardiness. The lack 
of critical comment in previous lives of Hawthorne 
is given as the raison d'etre of this additional bio- 
graphy. Messrs. Lathrop, Julian Hawthorne, and 
Conway are, however, the only biographers men- 
tioned ; while Mr. Henry James, whose work, con- 
tributed to the " English Men of Letters " series, is 
of the very essence of literary criticism, and Pro- 
fessor Woodberry, whose study of Hawthorne in 
the " American Men of Letters " series is nothing 
if not scholarly and critical, are wholly overlooked. 
Mr. Stearns's book contains much interesting mat- 
ter, and shows marks of faithful and loving labor; 
its citations and references and illustrations are 
varied and sometimes illuminating ; but its style is 
rambling and diffuse — a fault not offset by any 
keenness of criticism in the chapters devoted to what 
he proclaims as the distinctive feature of his work. 
Little less than wanton are such divagations as that

" is composed of soft-coal smoke, which, ascending 
from innumerable chimneys, is filtered in the upper 
skies, and then, mixed with vapor, is cast back upon 
the city by every change of wind. It is not unpleasant 
to the taste, and seems to be rather healthful than 
otherwise." He suggests that Hester Prynne may 
have been modelled after the author's younger sis- 
ter, and compares (not explicitly but by tentative 
suggestion) Hester's position with that of George 
Eliot in her relations with Lewes — which at least 
has the merit of startling novelty. " Fannie Kem- 
ble, as she was universally called," looks a bit strange 
in that spelling. In her the author thinks he dis- 
■ covers Hawthorne's " antipodes." Horatio Bridge's 
offer to guarantee the publisher against loss on a 
volume of Hawthorne's short stories is called a 
" proposition." Why will educated writers and 
speakers persist in making this word do double 
duty, to the neglect of " proposal," which we cannot 
afford to lose ? The portraits and other illustrations 
in this volume constitute its not least valuable feature.

the part of the institution which does its work under 
his efficient administration. We have been com- 
menting, from time to time, upon the journals of the 
Continental Congi-ess, as the volumes of that note- 
worthy undertaking have come to us from the 
Government Printing Office ; and we now have 
much satisfaction in calling attention to another 
work of similar character and almost equal impor- 
tance. This is nothing less than the full text of the 
manuscript called the " Court Book," which contains 
the records of the Virginia Company of London 
from 1619 to 1624. This manuscript was pur- 
chased, in the latter part of the seventeenth century, 
by Colonel William Byrd, from the estate of the 
Duke of Southampton, to whom it had come by 
inheritance from the Earl of Southampton, whom 
we all know as Shakespeare's friend and patron. 
Colonel Byrd's descendants owned it for about a 
century, and then it came into the possession of 
Thomas Jefferson, the Library of Congress buying 
it after his death. It is a work of fundamental im- 
portance to the student of American history, and its 
present publication has the special timeliness of just 
preceding the tercentenary of the first settlement 
made by the Virginia Company. The editorial work 
of this publication has been done by Miss Susan 
Myra Kingsbury, under the general supervision of 
Professor Herbert L. Osgood. Miss Kingsbury pro- 
vides a historical and bibliographical introduction 
of over two hundred pages. There are two large 
quarto volumes, handsomely printed on special paper 
with broad margins. Another important publication 
from the same source is the " Portrait Index " upon 
which the American Library Association has been 
engaged for some ten years. A few figures will 
give an idea of the comprehensiveness of this 



work. It fills over 1600 pages, indexes 1181 titles 
and 6216 volumes, and tells the inquirer where to 
find about 120,000 portraits of about 40,000 people. 
Both of the works which we have here described are 
withdrawn from free distribution, but may be pur- 
chased at nominal prices from the Superintendent 
of Documents. They will prove a boon to workers 

of many kinds.

tJie note-book of of a great variety of social types are 
a Journalist. reprinted in a handy and attractive 
volume with the title " Social Silhouettes " (Dutton), 
which well fits the unelaborate form of the sketches. 
The chapters average but seven pages in length, 
and the method of treatment, as well as the space 
devoted to each type, is nearly uniform. A rapid 
backward glance, with references to and brief quo- 
tations from standard authors, especially Dickens, 
Thackeray, and Matthew Arnold, is followed by 
more immediate and personal observations and illus- 
trations — the whole executed in a brisk, chatty, 
effective style that shows the facility engendered of 
long practice. Besides being an able journalist, the 
author is something of a reformer, and confesses 
that he has pleaded "with equal passion for all (or 
nearly all) the Fads." Thus we find him deploring 
the unequal lot of the servants of the Church : 
" Such are the conditions of life in the ministry of 
a Church which enjoys a secm*ed and acknowledged 
income of nearly six millions, and of which the chief 
pastor has £15,000 a year, the finest house in Lon- 
don, and an agreeable residence at Canterbury." In 
justifying his choice of " The Quidnunc " rather 
than " The Gossip " as heading to his 38th chapter, 
the author incidentally remarks : '' Shakespeare, as 
far as I remember, recognizes no male gossips." 
The captious critic might reply by citing Helena's 
speech in " All 's Well," i. 1, where Cupid is spoken of 
as gossipping ; also the Duke's speech in " Comedy 
of Errors," v. 1, " With all my heart I '11 gossip at 
this feast"; and again (a not very apt illustration 
from a doubtful play) King Henry's words to his 
courtiers in " Henry VIII.," v. 4, " My noble gos- 
sips, ye have been too prodigal." The skilful coining 
of needed words is often pardonable, but " hubristic " 
seems superfluous ; and moreover, being evidently 
from the same Greek word that gives us " hybrid," 
it should, consistently, be " hybristic."

recent publications is Mr. Root's "The Poetry of

esting study avoids both the iridescent foam of 
clever but shallow appreciation and the dead calm 
of unanimated learning. It devotes just so much

attention to the demands of pure scholarship in 
matters of form, dates, sources, etc., as is necessary 
to make clear the nature of Chaucer's development. 
Disputed questions are touched upon briefly or rele- 
gated to the footnotes, but not without a succinct 
statement of the author's position. Each poem is 
taken up separately, single chapters being given to 
"The Romaunt of the Rose," "Troilus and Cris- 
eyde," "The House of Fame," and "The Legend 
of Good Women," and four — nearly half the book 
— to " The Canterbury Tales." In his treatment of 
Chaucer's literary art, Mr. Root is eminently suc- 
cessful ; throughout he is sane and impartial. Not 
all that Chaucer did is on that account good, not 
even some of the things for which the ungodly 
praise him. Our author has high ideals for art, and 
not even Chaucer may violate them with impunity. 
It is with peculiar affection that Mr. Root regards 
his author, and we are not surprised that he should 
take issue with the Wordsworthians for Chaucer's 
right to the third place after the matchless two, 
Shakespeare and Milton. It is because Chaucer 
grips our affections that we give him this place, so 
much more of our own human nature has he than 
the rapt and solitary Wordsworth. 



A streak of the preacher, the ser- 
Freacher. ^ monizer, runs through us all, and 

most of us dearly love to hold forth 
in an edifying strain if we can only capture an 
audience, or even a single auditor, to listen. To 
this rule Dr. Robertson NicoU, the accomplished 
editor of the London " Bookman," is no exception ; 
but his congregation is made up of willing hearers. 
His late collection of essays, or sermonettes, or edi- 
torial homilies, whichever one chooses to call them, 
has the oddly alluring title, " The Key of the Blue 
Closet" (Dodd), and is composed, at least in part, 
of reprinted pieces, as readable as they are brief. 
The chapter that gives the book its title is the third, 
which opens with a reference to " The Mill on 
the Floss " — to Mrs. Pullet's apprehension lest her 
husband should fail to find the key of the Blue 
Closet after her death. " The Blue Closet " seems 
to mean, in Dr. NicoU's book, the inner and secret 
chamber of the soul, and also the less obvious side 
of things in general, although the title is only loosely 
and partially applicable to the chapters grouped 
under it. Four good personal sketches — of Alex- 
ander Bain, R. H. Hutton, James Payn, and Robert 
A. Neil — based on some actual acquaintance with 
these men, and written on the occasion of their sev- 
eral deaths, are particularly to be commended. The 
late George Macdonald is also noticed in a rather 
more perfunctory sketch. The essayist's high praise 
of the letters of his intimate friend Neil, of which he 
possesses many, and which he finds more Lamb-like 
(so to speak) than any he has ever read, makes one 
wish they might be published, under his editorship. 
So wholesome and enjoyable a book as this little 
volume of essays should find many readers, as it 
doubtless will. 



Beainning of ^ /«^ J^^"^ ^go Professor Charles 
a history of Seignobos, the well-known French 

Civilization. historian, published a three-volume 
History of Civilization designed for use in secondary 
schools. The work was popular from the beginning, 
and soon became widely used. Not long ago the 
Messrs. Scribner announced an English version of 
this history, the translation to be the work of Pro- 
fessor A. H. Wilde. The first volume of the series 
has appeared. It is a plain straightforward account 
of civilized life in the Orient, Greece, and Rome,, 
one that is easily within the intellectual range of the 
average high school pupil. The translation seems 
to have been carefully made, and the editor's notes, 
though not numerous, are of distinct value. Never- 
theless the book is something of a disappointment. 
In his effort to cover the entire field the author has 
naturally been compelled to include a great deal 
that is already found in the high-school text-book. 
The advanced student will probably not find very 
much material that is new to him, at least not so 
much as a book designed for supplementary reading 
ought to contain. It may be that in France the 
makers of text-books content themselves with giving 
an account of political matters only ; and in such a 
case this work would be found very satisfactory. 
But our own authors are more ambitious, and insist 
on making the growth of culture a prominent part 
of their manuals. Their discussions need to be sup- 
plemented with more detailed accounts of the more 
important topics and periods, rather than with a 

general survey. 

The short life of Thomas HiU Green, 
written by his pupil and friend the 
late R. L. Nettleship, and prefixed to 
the third volume of Green's works published twenty 
yeai's ago, is now issued in separate form by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. with a brief preface by 
Mrs. Green. As a thinker who reconciled philosophy 
with religion on the one hand and with practical poli- 
tics on the other, the distinguished professor of moral 
philosophy and author of " Prolegomena to Ethics " 
and other writings is an interesting figure to readers 
of serious and speculative turn, and they will wel- 
come this convenient and attractive reprint. Nettle- 
ship's memoir of Green, as an authoritative reviewer 
said at the time of its first appearance, " fairly finds 
him out." He was a man, his friend Leslie Stephen 
has observed, " whose homely exterior, reserved 
manner, and middle-class radicalism were combined 
with singular loftiness of character. He recalls in 
different ways Wordsworth, of whom he was to some 
degree a disciple even in philosophy, and Bright, 
whom he followed in politics. In youth he was 
impressed by Carlyle and Maurice. He developed 
the philosophical ideas congenial to him from the 
first, ' by a sympathetic study of Kant and Hegel.' " 
Readers of " Robert Elsmere " may not yet have 
forgotten " Mr. Gray," who is Thomas Hill Green 
as portrayed by the novelist. An apparently excel- 
lent portrait of a different sort appears as frontis- 
piece to this inviting volume.

[Jan. 16, 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. B. H. Blackwell, Oxford, sends us a small volume 
called " Westminster Versions," being translations of 
English verse into Latin and Greek made by a score or 
more of scholars, and collected under the editorial super- 
vision of Mr. Herbert F. Fox. The translations are from 
many poets, including such moderns as Henley and 
Swinburne, and one venturesome Oxonian has even done 
Lowell's " The Courtin' " in Latin elegiacs. A second 
volmne of similar character comes from Longmans, 
Green, & Co., and contains the " Translations into Latin 
and Greek Verse " made by the late H. A. J. Mimro. 
These versions were printed for private circulation in 
1884, but are now published for the first time. Dante 
and Goethe, besides a great number of English poets, 
are included among the subjects of these experiments. 

Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. are the American pub- 
lishers of the translation of Heine's works which was 
undertaken by the late Charles G. Leland, and carried 
to completion after his death by other hands. The edi- 
tion makes up a set of twelve volumes, the first eight of 
which give us the prose writings in Leland's version. 
Of the four volumes of verse, one (the " Book of Songs ") 
was translated by Mr. T. Brooksbank, who died before 
the volume was published. The remainmg three have 
been done by Miss Margaret Armour (Mrs. W. B. 
Macdougall), and, considering the extraordmary diffi- 
culty of the task, in an unexpectedly satisfactory man- 
ner. The best of Heine evaporates in translation, no 
doubt, but readers who possess no German may be con- 
gratulated upon having offered to them so close an 
approach to the original as is found in the present 
version. 

The Macmillan Co. pubUsh a translation, in modern 
French prose, of " La Chanson de Roland," edited by 
Professor J. Geddes, Jr. The apparatus, consisting of 
introduction, bibliography, notes, manuscript readings, 
and index, is very extensive, and there is also a series 
of highly interesting illustrations from various sources. 
Other French texts are Racine's " Les Plaideurs," edited 
by Professor C. H. C. Wright, and published by Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co., and a volume of " FeuiUetons 
Choisis," edited by Mr. Cloudesley Brereton, and pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde. Two German texts from 
the Messrs. Heath are " Wilkommen in Deutschland," 
a reader prepared by Professor W. E. Mosher, and 
" Munchhausen's Reisen und Abenteuer," edited by 
Professor F. G. G. Schmidt. Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co. publish " Das Edle Blut," a tale by Herr Ernst von 
Wildenbruch, edited by Professor Ashley K. Hardy. 

The new edition of Keats's poems prepared by Mr. 
H. Buxton Forman for the Oxford Clarendon Press 
is neither an exhaustive variorum edition nor a mere 
unedited text; but aims to present the complete body 
of Keats's verse illustrated by the most significant of 
existing variant readings and cancelled passages. Thus 
the reader is able to obtain a good general view of the 
processes and results of Keats's creative faculty without 
becoming submerged in minutice. A long and inter- 
esting introduction describes the various sources and 
materials upon which the authoritative text of Keats 
now rests. Needless to say, no one is more thoroughly 
familiar with this material than Mr. Buxton Forman, 
and it is not likely that his labors in Keats's behalf will 
ever be superseded. The present volume is uniform in 
make-up with the recent Oxford editions of Shelley and 



Blake, which is to say that it is in every detail a model 
of conservative book-making. There is a photogra^ 
vure frontispiece of Keats at Wentworth Place, after 
Severn's painting; a title-page vignette from a tracing 
by Keats of a Grecian urn (not the urn, however) ; an 
etching on steel by William Bell Scott of Severn's 
poignant death-bed portrait of the poet; a reproduction 
of Haydon's life-mask of Keats placed in the position 
of Severn's death-bed sketch; and a facsimile leaf from 
a holograph draft of " The Eve of St. Mark," containing 
sixteen lines not hitherto published in any other edition.

" Qualitative Analysis as a Laboratory Basis for the 
Study of General Inorganic Chemistry," by Professor 
William Conger Morgan. 

Heywood's " The Royall King and Loyall Subject," 
reprinted from the quarto of 1637 and edited by Miss 
Kate Watkins Tibbals, is a recent piiblication of the 
University of Pennsylvania. 

The " Antigone," in a verse-translation by Mr. Robert 
Whitelaw, with introduction and notes by Mr. J. Chur- 
ton Collins, and intended for school-study as a literaiy 
classic, is published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

" Animal Micrology," by Dr. Michael F. Guyer, is a 
recent publication of the University of Chicago Press. 
It is a practical manual of microscopical technique as 
applied to the preparation and study of animal tissues. 
Two new volumes in the " Langham Series of Art 
Monographs," imported by the Messrs. Scribner, are 
« Hokusai: The Old Man Mad with Painting," by Mr. 
Edward F. Strange, and " Oxford," by Mr. H. J. L. J. 
Mass^. 

Herr Felix Weingartner's essay on " Symphony 
Writers since Beethoven," translated by Mr. Arthur 
Bles, has been made (with the help of portraits and 
thick pages) into a sizable book, which is now imported 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Four commemorative addresses by President Eliot 
are collected into a small volume and published by the 
American Unitarian Association. The subjects are 
Franklin, Washington, C banning, and Emerson, and the 
book is entitled " Four American Leaders." 

For the fourth issue of their "Lakeside Classics," 
Messrs. R. R. Donnelley & Sons have chosen William 
Penn's " Fruits of Solitude," which comes in a tastefully- 
printed volume with a portrait in photogravure. An 
editorial note is supplied by Mr. John Vance Cheney. 

Miss Elsie M. Lang's " Literary London," introduced

tographs, will prove useful to the tourist who is in

writers. The arrangement is alphabetical. Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons publish the volume. 

Gifford's translation of Juvenal faces the Latin text 
on alternate pages of the latest volume to be published 
in the " Temple Greek and Latin Classics." The intro- 
duction and notes are credited to Mr. A. F. Cole. The 
freedom of this old translation is brought out by the

Grfford, the average being three English for two Latin

The quest of American literature for the British 
market is an interesting sign of the times. In estab- 
lishing a New York branch of its business, the well- 
known publishing house of Chatto & Windus, which has 
existed for over two hundred years in London, frankly 
announces that it has been " moved to take this step by 
the fast-increasing importance of American literature, 
both grave and gay, which is now eagerly sought by 
British readers." This is a decided reversal of the old 
order prevailing in the days when it used to be scorn- 
fully asked, " Who reads an American book? "

'—' alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel-

the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preminently a book

KEEPING UP WITH THEMAGAZINES 

without giving all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. CThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What 's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.

OESIDES being a book that "will long remain the standard work on 
the Colorado Desert" f San Francisco Chronicle), Mr. James's descrip- 
tion of "one of the most fascinatingly interesting places in the world" 
(New York Mail) contains exceedingly timely chapters on the overflow of 
the Colorado River into the mysterious Salton Sea. 

The story of how Mr. James and a few pioneer companions, in roughly constructed boats, 
followed the new course of the Colorado into the Salton lake, at one time cutting their way 
through an almost impenetrable mesquite forest, at others shooting turbulent rapids and 
narrowly escaping foundering as huge sections of the undermined banks fell into the rushing 
stream, raising gigantic waves, is full of thrilling interest. Those who desire to learn the 
precise facts in regard to the Salton Sea will find them carefully assembled as a result of 
the author's special investigation. — New York Tribune.

authority. The two vohxmes are of extraordinary 
interest. Mr. James had a marvellously interesting 
subject and he has treated it skilfully and attrac- 
tively." — Philadelphia Press. 

" Mr. James is able to bring knowledge of much 
that is absolutely unknown to the average American 
reader." — The OtUlook. 



"A fascinating work, with minute descriptions of 
every phase of the Sahara of California and Arizona. 
What strikes the reader is the variety of informa- 
tion." — Chicago Tribune. 

" The most elaborate work he has yet done." 

— • New York Evening Post. 

" The illustrations are conspicuously good and 
add to the intrinsic interest of Mr. James's valuable 
volumes." — Brooklyn Times. 



THE DIAL says : 

"Twenty-five years of observation and experience in the desert have resulted in a remark- 
able and valuable work.

it must be ranked as the most serious and extended criticism of the subject that has yet been 
made, it is not without frequent tinges of humor which make it, while instructive, also 
deeply entertaining.

BY THE LIGHT OF THE SOUL By mary e. wilkins freeman

HOURS IN A LIBRARY. 



A good many readers have lately been renew- 
ing their acquaintance with Leslie Stephen's 
" Hours in a Library," that series of sane and 
delightful essays in literary criticism, — readers 
whose attention has been thus happily reclaimed 
by reason of the reappearance of the four vol- 
umes in a new edition, and the recent publication 
of the author's " Life and Letters." His own 
opinion of the work, as expressed in a letter to a 
friend, was characteristically modest. 

" I did not send it because — it is a very foolish rea^ 
son — I am — do not mention it to any one — rather 
ashamed of it. I don't know why, but I have a sus- 
picion that I am not a good critic, or perhaps it is merely 
a case of distorted vanity. Lowell bullied me out of a 
copy; but I regretted it, and could wish that the book 
should not have crossed the Atlantic. However, you 
will be merciful as a critic of mine. Don't say anything 
about the book when you write again, or it will seem to 
me as though I had been fishing for a compliment. This 
is written on the understanding that you will preserve 
a judicious silence in the interests of my moral health. 
Publicity, as you truly say, is a poison, and private flat- 
tery is not much better." 

The whole tenor of Stephen's thought makes it 
obvious that theie was no affectation in these 
words of self-deprecation, but justice to a book 
depends upon the public's verdict rather than 
the author's, and it has been rendered, in this 
instance, in terms that emphatically contradict 
Stephen's own estimate. 

We are not, however, at this late day reviewing 
the " Hours in a Library," but have merely taken 
the title as a peg upon which to hang a few dis- 
cursive general remarks . The expression ' ' hours 
in a library " means many things to many minds, 
and what it means in any particular case depends 
wholly upon personal associations and experi- 
ences. To readers of old memoirs, and even more 
to those fortunate men and women who have the 
precious memory of a quiet period of youth and 
adolescence spent in some old-fashioned house 
with generous furniture of old-fashioned books, 
it means rich treasures of recollection, fond remin- 
iscences of exploration and discovery and wonder, 
as the mind reciu-s to those old days with their at- 
mosphere of delightful studies. To others, again, 
whose early joy in the companionship of books 
has been preserved as something more than a 
fading memory, who have not permitted the cares

of the workaday world to sever them from that 
source of primary inspiration, but still keep them- 
selves surroimded by good literature and their 
daily lives sweetened by its ministry, the thought 
of " hours in a library " has a vital content, and 
expresses the occupation which still makes life 
best worth the living. A few are themselves pro- 
ducers of literature, and pay direct tribute to its 
beneficence, as Mr. Allen to Malory in " The 
Choir Invisible," and Mr. Quiller-Couch to 
Rabelais in " Sir John Constantine." But most 
of those who continue through all their lives to 
find in literature an ever-availing solace are con- 
tent to absorb without giving out — except in the 
natural reactions of thought upon environment, 
— and the world never learns what their "hours 
in a library" have meant, and still mean, to them. 

But the lapse of time works portentous 
changes in most human conditions, and in none 
more so than in this relation between men and 
books. The connotations of the term " library " 
have become so transformed that most men now 
advanced in years find themselves compelled to 
readjust both their ideas and their habits . In the 
old days, the word meant the private collection 
of books, upon which the personality of the col- 
lector was impressed, and which was hallowed 
by all sorts of tender and intimate associations. 
The qualifying adjectives " public " and " circu- 
lating " were used to indicate inferior kinds of 
libraries, that might be found usefid upon occa- 
sion, but that could not touch the heart. They 
represented the utilitarian as opposed to the sen- 
timental, and whenever those two appeals come 
into rivalry, we know which will win with all 
persons of gentle instincts. But to-day the li- 
brary, in the good old sense, has become a rare 
phenomenon ; for the word would surely be mis- 
applied to these simulacra of libraries, filled with 
expensive and unread sets of " standard authors," 
which occupy certain conventional quarters in 
the homes of the rich, and are obviously nothing 
more than a part of the general scheme of lux- 
urious decoration. And the public library in its 
typical form ( Bibliotheca Carnegiana), which 
is what most men think of nowadays when they 
think of libraries at all, is not a good substitute. 
It is housed in an imposing but cheerless build- 
ing ; it buys the books named in the A. L. A, 
model catalogue ; it classifies them upon the 
Dewey system ; and it has rules. To spend 
" hours " in such a place may be profitable for 
many practical purposes ; it is not likely to feed 
the contemplative spirit, or prove stimulative to 
the production of essays in Stephen's manner. 

Along with this (probably inevitable) evolu- 



tion of the library into an institution, there has 
come into existence the modern librarian, — a 
very useful person, highly accomplished as an 
administrative officer, an expert in accession- 
listing and catalogue-making, a man alert to 
grasp and weigh every idea new to his craft, an 
admirable factor in an admirable scheme of 
organization. And yet something seems to be 
lacking. He is so completely a custodian of 
books, he is necessarily so occupied with their 
accidents, that he does not have the time, even 
if he have the disposition, to become their inti- 
mate. And since this is so, he cannot become the 
wise and helpful intermediary that his old-time 
predecessor was wont to be. The seeker for 
counsel will get from him bibliographical infor- 
mation in copious draughts ; he will hardly get 
that fertilizing inspiration which flows from a 
mind saturated with humanistic culture. In this 
respect, the evolution of the type of the modem 
librarian has been analogous to that of the modem 
type of university president ; it has been an in- 
evitable evolution, we repeat, but it leaves us 
with a sort of wistful regret for the type that has 
vanished. 

This subject was brought to the attention of 
the Narragansett Conference last summer in the 
address of President Hill of the American Li- 
brary Association, who used the following words : 

" There are those who claim that the old style libra- 
rian who knew books has disappeared and his place has 
been taken by the modern librarian, who acts as the 
executive officer of the institution. Such critics sigh for 
the library of old, with its musty tomes and its air of 
seclusion and repose ; they long for the return of the 
librarian with his quiet, dignified, studious air, and they 
resent the change to the utmost." 

And then the speaker suggested a possible re- 
conciliation of the two ideals, probably the only 
one possible for the large municipal library of 
our times. 

" To reach the highest degree of perfection the great 
public library must have not only its executive whose 
guiding hand will steer the craft through all kinds of 
business dangers, but also scholarly, studious men and 
women who know books and how to use them. Both are 
necessary to the welfare of the large library. The wise 
administrator is the one who, while keeping his eyes upon 
the needs of the whole system, has the ability to discover 
the specialists who are needed to round out the work 
of the library, and to place each in his own particular 
niche." 

This is what Mr. Putnam has done with excel- 
lent results in our national library at the cap- 
ital ; it is what several of our larger cities are 
doing to the extent of which their resources will 
permit. -r"^ 

Discussing the same subject upon still broader 
grounds, President Faunce urged upon the Asso-

elation the importance of encouraging the old 
" fattening " use of libraries as no less important 
than their use for purposes of research. 

" The library must encourage slow, painful, thoughtful 
reading. . . . The habit of reading as a substitute for 
thinking is worth nothing, but is sheer damage to the 
mental fibre. . . . Our students need to use books not 
only as tools, but as friends. In the old days, when the 
reading of college students was far more promiscuous 
than to-day, they were accustomed to regard books al- 
most as personal acquaintances, and there was a genuine 
exchange and reaction of writer ai\d reader. The modern 
method of reading is far more accurate and definite than 
the older method, and is obviously eft'ective in securing 
results. But it must be supplemented by the ' browsing ' 
of former days, by the large horizons which come from 
being set free in the companionship of great minds." 

The " hours in a library " which are spent in 
hunting down references and verifying citations 
are by no means wasted, but they are not the 
hours that contribute to the strengthening of the 
tap-root of the intellectual life, nor are they the 
hours which, in the retrospect, are recalled as 
hours of unadidterated delight. 



THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE 
CHILDREN. 



It was not so very long ago that children in the 
public libraries, like dogs in the parks, were unwel- 
come unless kept in leash by a responsible attendant. 
If one of tender years happened to stray into those 
awful precincts alone, he was gently but firmly 
shown to the door and told to run away. But all 
this is changed now, and some of our public library 
authorities are even raising the question whether the 
children are not getting more than their just share 
of attention, to the neglect of their elders. 

The " story hour " which has come to be a recog- 
nized institution in our best libraries is doing 
as much as any other library influence to interest 
children in good reading. A certain period is set 
aside, — sometimes regularly each week, sometimes 
on special occasions or holidays, — when the chil- 
dren's librarian, or an expert story-teller from with- 
out who has both sympathy and discrimination, 
gathers the children about her and tells them the 
tales that form the basis of our best literature. 
Listening to stories is the natural approach to 
reading from books, and is the first step toward the 
acquisition of cultiu'e. 

But it is not only in the reading-room that chil- 
dren are made to know and to love books. As 
Mahomet to the mountain, so the library goes to the 
child if the child will not come to it. The idea of 
the peripatetic library — the " travelling library " 
as it is now generally called — is in line with mod- 
ern progress. In these twentieth-century days, space 
has been annihilated by rail and steam, inertia has 



been overcome, locality has been destroyed ; the 
world is on wheels. What, then, so natural as the 
travelling library? 

We are probably indebted to the Scotch for the 
germ which has developed into this important sys- 
tem of book-distribution. Early in the last century 
(in 1810, I believe it was), a collection of religious 
tracts was circulated in Scotland, augmented a few 
years later by books of standard literature and 
science. These " itinerant libraries," so-called, 
flourished for more than two decades, but finally 
died a natural death. Thirty years after their disap- 
pearance, Australia developed a peripatetic system, 
and somewhat later the Universities of Oxford and 
Cambridge sent out university extension libraries ; 
but the travelling library in this country dates from 
1889, and owes its origin to Mr. Melvil Dewey, 
Director of the New York State Library at Albany. 

The travelling library is simply an extension of 
the state library, or in some cases (as in Wisconsin) 
of the county library, twenty-five or fifty or a hun- 
dred books being sent out at once and entrusted for 
three months or six months to the care of a respon- 
sible person who becomes a local or sub librarian. 
This local librarian loans the books — to children 
as well as to adults — under a simple code of regu- 
lations, returning the entire library when it has 
served its purpose, and receiving in exchange a new 
selection of books, thus keeping alive the interest of 
the readers and stimulating them to read. Stations 
are established in village shops and postoffices, often 
in farm-houses at some distance from the towns but 
conveniently located with reference to the rural 
population. In a number of states, travelling libra- 
rians are employed. The travelling librarian is 
a real literary evangelist, preaching the gospel of 
good books. He strengthens the hands of the local 
librarian, revives the flagging interest, establishes 
new centres of culture, and carries light into the 
dark places. What a field of usefulness is open to 
him ! Coming into personal contact with hundreds 
of people, young and old, to whom the world of 
books is a terra incognita, he rescues many a country 
youth from intellectual starvation, fans in some the 
spark which shall kindle into genius, and in others 
not so gifted stimulates the intelligent use of the 
powers which they possess — insuring at least better 
crops and broader citizenship. 

The transportation of the libraries from place to 
place offers a problem which each state is working 
out for itself. In some localities, notably in the 
South, the railroads, recognizing the philanthropy 
in the idea which underlies this library movement, 
are shipping the libraries without charge. In other 
parts of the country, the local centre pays a nominal 
amount to cover the cost of freight. Mr. Dewey 
strongly advocates, and has already put into commis- 
sion in New York, a type of library wagon, driven 
by a trained librarian, who, after the manner of the 
religious colporteur of a former generation, goes 
from station to station carrying his books with him. 

It may be asked how large a part the children have 



68 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



in the travelling library. I answer, a very large part. 
In most libraries from one-foui*th to one-third of the 
books are adapted particularly to children's use, and 
children are among the most devoted readers. In 
a small village in New York State, a girl of thirteen 
recently drew from a travelling library during the 
six months of its stay thirty-two books. A boy of 
fifteen drew twenty-five books. The statistics at 
other points show an interest almost as great. 

Several of our large city libraries, notably the 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburg and the New York 
City Public Library, have adapted the travelling 
system to urban conditions, and are sending out into 
the tenements trained children's librarians bearing 
good books. The books, in libraries of from twelve 
to twenty volumes, known as " home libraries," are 
placed in the hands of certain families who agree to 
take care of them for a specified time and to loan 
them to such neighbors as may wish to read. Little 
circles are thus formed — for the most part of chil- 
dren, though grown-up members of the families join 
in them too. The library visitor comes once a week 
and talks to them, telling them stories, such stories 
as are told to the library children dm-ing the " story 
hour." Then she makes the connection between the 
story and the book, taking a volume from the case 
and reading a few interesting pages from it. After a 
friendly hour, she goes away leaving the seed to 
germinate. When one set of books are read through, 
she brings a new set and takes the old ones back — 
a little soiled, perhaps, but the city can well afford 
to burn them and buy more, for the books are mak- 
ing citizens, and these children who are learning 
to read good literature will not need as many police- 
men to loojt after them a few years hence, thanks to 
the library visitor. 

Nor does this far-reaching philanthropy stop with 
the reading of books. The library worker gains the 
confidence of parents as well as of children. She 
learns the troubles and discouragements of the lower 
strata of society, and is able to give help. She does 
much of the work usually accomplished by the 
" friendly visitor " of the charitable organizations, 
and does it more effectively ; for the class that of 
all others is most in need of aid and sympathy is 
shy in the presence of charity and often suspicious 
of the church. 

Another important movement in library extension 
has to do with the placing of libraries in the schools, 
its aim being to bring into accord the work of the 
two great educational influences of the present age 
— the public library and the public school. When 
one stops to consider the many points at which the 
work of the librarian and the teacher overlap, it will 
be seen that a great saving of energy and an enor- 
mous gain in efficiency must result from this union. 
The function of the library is to put the right book 
into the right hands, — not only into the hands that 
are outstretched for it, but into those that most need 
it. The librarian, busied with the details of admin- 
istrative work, — purchasing, classifying, catalogu- 
ing, keeping in order, — though she may have, and 



must have, sympathy with the children who frequent 
the library, cannot come into that close relationship 
with them which is enjoyed by the teacher, who has 
them with her six hours in every day, Sundays and 
holidays excepted, who directs their intellectual 
progress and comes to know their needs more intel- 
ligently and often more sympathetically than even 
the parent. 

These considerations have led to the development 
of a system in which the public library places its 
resom'ces at the command of the schools, the libra- 
rian giving of her practical knowledge of the books 
and the teacher of her knowledge of the child. The 
librarian visits the school and talks to the children, 
tells them how to " find things " in books, tells the 
younger ones a few good classic stories and suggests 
where they may find others, tells the older ones how 
to use a card catalogue, how to run down a refer- 
ence, where to find good material to help them in 
their history and geography. The teacher makes 
individual application of the librarian's generalities, 
and fits a particular book to a particular want. The 
librarian is the specialist : she has at her fingers' 
ends the entire literary pharmacopoeia, and is skilled 
in the uses of all sorts of material ; but the teacher 
is familiar with the child's constitution and habits — 
a sort of knowledge quite as important. Consulta- 
tion of this sort is in accord with modern practice, 
and is yielding pronounced results in schoolrooms 
where it has been tried. The books are supplied 
from the school library so far as the school library 
can meet the demand, but beyond that point the 
public library is drawn upon, and offers from its 
greater resources a wide range of reference material, 
and books on special subjects appropriate either to 
the work of the class or to the celebration of the 
annual festivals and the birthdays of great men and 
women. These books are sent to the schoolroom for 
reference or distribution, and the school is thus 
made, in effect, a branch library, — or, if you please, 
a travelling library station. 

If the public library is convenient to the school, 
and in villages it always should be, — the refer- 
ence work is often best done in the library itself. 
This method has the double advantage of affording 
a quiet place in which the pupil may work without 
distraction, and of familiarizing him with the library 
— helping him to acquire the " library habit." If 
the alliance of school and library accomplished 
nothing beyond this, it would be well worth all the 
efforts that have been put forth in its behalf. 

The object sought by both librarian and teacher 
is the culture of the child, particularly the develop- 
ment in him of a discriminating love of books ; for 
this is the straight road to culture. The child is 
placed, by law, under the influence of the teacher 
during just those years when, if ever, the reading 
habit is formed and the trend given which deter- 
mines the child's intellectual life. It is a critical 
period, and no agency shoidd be overlooked which 
can contribute toward the end in view. 

In such ways as these the public library is reach.

ing out after the children. In the country farm- 
house, in the city tenement, and in the schoolroom, 
as well as under its own roof-tree, it is bringing to 
them the knowledge of a gi'eat new world — a world 
of opportunity, of encom-agement, of delight. It is 
extending their vision over distant lands and bygone 
centuries, acquainting them with the secrets of 
nature and the mysteries of science, opening their 
hearts to the sweet influences of poetry, and point- 
ing out to them the paths of wisdom and of right-

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The prices of English novels, more particularly 
the prices at which they sell best, are discussed in a re- 
cently reported interview with that veteran publisher of 
sixty years' experience, Mr. Edward Marston, whose 
octogenarian reminiscences were lately reviewed in our 
pages. His observations are pertinent at tliis time of a sup- 
posed demand for a reduction in book-prices — in strik- 
ing contrast with the marked advance in all the costs of 
manufacttu-e. Many of Wilkie Colluis's novels were pub- 
lished by the firm with which Mr. Marston was so long 
connected; and it is a curious fact that, whereas these 
works had an enormous sale in their three-volume form 
at half a guinea a volume, and generally a good sale in 
the one-voliune form at six shillings, at two shillings they 
fell flat. (Query: might not this have been partly diie 
to their having been already widely read in periodicals?) 
In the same way, all of Mr. Blackmore's novels were 
very successful as "three-deckers," and afterward not 
unsuccessful as six-shilling one- volume books ; but they 
sold much less readily when offered for half a crown 
— with the single exception of " Lorna Doone." And 
thereby hangs a tale. The issue of this ever-charming 
story chanced to fall at the time of the marriage of 
Princess Louise to the Marquis of Lome, and the im- 
pression prevailed that Lorna and Lome were in some 
way connected, — a mistake that proved advantageous 
to all concerned. In the case of Black's novels the same 
pronoimced disinclination to buy cheap editions mani- 
fested itself, and the half-crown reprints caused a serious 
loss to the publishers. Mr. Marston's experience seems to 
show that, leaving out of accoimt the " penny dreadfuls " 
and the " shilling shockers," the British public prefers 
to buy its favorite fiction at a fair price, or about six 
shillings ; and this preference is further illustrated by the 
poor sale of short novelettes unless they are made up and 
offered in six-shilling form, even though the matter con- 
tained be but a third or a quarter of that in the ordinary 
novel. . . . 

Why Mr. Wright is to give us a new life of 
Pater is explained in the publisher's announcement of 
the forthcoming volume. The biographer wishes to 
correct a number of " staggering errors " said to have 
been committed by previous biographers. " (1) It has 
been asserted that ux boyhood and youth Pater showed 
no precocious signs of a desire to write. Mr. Wright 
shows that he was perhaps the most voluminous boy- 
author who ever lived. (2) It has been asserted that 
in childhood Pater never wrote poetry except a few 
humorous verses. Mr. Wright has in his own posses- 
sion many hundreds of lines of serious poetry written 



by Pater in his early years, and can show that he wrote 
thousands of such lines. (3) It has been said without 
contradiction that Pater was popular at school. Mr. 
Wright shows on the contrary that nobody could have 
been more unpopidar there. (4) It has been set down 
again and again in print that Pater's chief interest in 
his early life was philosophy. It was not so. His chief 
interest durmg his youth and early manhood was En- 
glish literature. (5) Students of Pater will remember 
that a biographer asserts that his metaphysical studies 
did not destroy his strong religious instinct. On the 
contrary they did, and for many years Pater was quite 
severed from religion. (6) The legend fotmd in most 
accounts of Pater — the legend that he wrote very few 
letters — is proved quite a falsification of the facts in 
Mr. Wright's ' life.' He wrote an enormous number of 
letters — as many as four hixndred to a single friend, 
and most of them long letters." Well, we shall see 
what we shall see. As to the fifth item, Mr. Wright 
would seem to have set himself a difficult task, — to 
read the mind's construction in the writings of a man, 
and to read it so accurately as to tell just when faith 
and when skepticism predominated. It is pretty well 
known that at Pater's death he was thinking seriously 
of taking orders, , » • 

"Subterranean literature" in Germany appears 
to have as large a sale as in our own and other coun- 
tries. The monster editions of such hair-raisers as 
" Jack the Ripper," and similar manuals for the fitting 
of vagrant youth to follow careers of crime, pass unno- 
ticed, in fact imsuspected, by the readers of Walter 
Pater, of Mr. Meredith, and of Mr. Henry James. But 
a German authority says that issues of seven himdred 
thousand copies of what we used to know here as " dime 
novels " are not unusual. Indeed, the dime novel, now 
apparently suffering a decline in this country, is ravag- 
ing the land of the Teutons, where most of the boys are 
said to prefer an American Indian story to any other 
tale. The frontier adventures of trappers and scouts, 
the prairie perils from wolves and redskins, the mighty 
encounters with the formidable grizzly bear — all these 
make the young heart of Germany beat with rib-rending 
throbs. This interest in stories of the Mohawk brand 
dates back as far as 1823, when Cooper's novels began 
to fire the blood of the juvenile reader. Imitators were 
not slow in following the trail blazed by the master ; and 
now he is a feeble writer who cannot out-Cooper Cooper 
by several hundred thrills per volume. There are said 
to be at present in Germany some five hundred firms 
engaged in the production of Cooperesque tales, with 
three thousand travelling salesmen to place the direful 
output on the market. The illustrations vie with the 
text in sensational quality, and (alas ! ) a book of about 
two hundred and fifty pages can be bought for less than 
our dime. . , , 

An irritating practice among library workers 
is touched upon by the Boston " Transcript " in the 
coui'se of some recent commendatory remarks about 
that energetic and indispensable library monthly, 
"Public Libraries," which has just entered upon its 
twelfth year. The practice referred to is that of libra- 
rians and library journals in the use, or rather the non- 
use, of capital letters and quotation marks. "What 
good does it do," asks the " Transcript," " to omit 
these from book titles, until an appearance of almost 
entire illiteracy is obtained ? If it saves the time of 
the compositor it wastes that of the reader, for he has

to go back and read the title a second time to find out 
where it begins and ends. We know that this is the 
result of a library philosophy which taught that anything 
on earth could be sacrificed in order to save a few 
seconds' time, but that does not endear it to us. . . . 
Because our ancestors used what seems now an unnec- 
essary number of capital letters, we are not justified in 
trying to abolish them altogether, any more than the 
fact that those ancestors wore lace, frills, and long wigs 
justifies us in suddenly rushing into the street without 
any clothes at all." It is sincerely to be hoped that 
" Public Libraries " may see fit to take the lead in doing 
away with some of these confusing, distressing, and 
freakish practices which, along with certain orthograph- 
ical deformities, have crept into tolerance among library 
workers. • . . 

Dreams of an endowed theatre may still be per- 
mitted to hopeful souls, in spite of the fact that some 
recent local experiments in that direction could hardly 
be called inspiring. It may be that the idea may yet 
be worked out on a national basis; and it is to this 
form of it that Mme. Ristori addresses herself in her 
article in the January " Putnam," written but a few

Brunetiere's successor in the French Academy 
is yet vmnamed, and the question of a choice is of 
interest to many outside of France as well as within. 
Mistral has been spoken of, and doubtless deserves the 
honor. But there is a difficulty. Our Provence poet 
is seventy-six years old, and at that age the grooves 
are commonly worn so deep that there is a rude jolt in 
getting out of them. He would have to visit Paris at 
least once if he accepted Academic honors, and Paris 
he has never loved. In fact, he has seldom left his pa- 
ternal acres since the day when, asked what he meant 
to be, he replied, " A poet." With remarkable and 
admirable persistency he has remained true to his high 
calling and has lived the life he purposed to live. A 
lonely and even pathetic figure he may appear, holding 
himself aloof from the great world and deploring the 
mad rush of his countrymen from rural quiet and peace 
to urban din and strife; but there is grandeur in his 
solitude, and sublimity in his high ideal of religion and 
beauty as inseparably connected with a peaceful coimtry 
life. 

An announcement from Mr. H. G. Wells which 
will interest Americans, and especially those who are 
students of the race question, is found in the following 
words attributed to him. " I have dealt," he says, in 
speaking of his writings on America, " very frankly with 
the color question, and it is quite possible that I may 



ultimately make it my subject and give a large portion 
of my life to it." Surely there is need of a prophet's 
wisdom in treating our vexed negro problem, and who 
knows what this prophetic novelist may accomplish if 
he carries out his half-formed plan ? Half the serious- 
ness he bestows on his mammoth rats and long-tailed 
comets and all the marvellous creations of the marvel- 
lous future might well be given to a few of the pressing 
problems of the living present.

Bibliographical work in libraries can be made 

both creditable and useful, as is shown by the Cambridge 
(Mass.) Public Library, which has expended a part of 
its surplus energy in preparing and publishing a biblio- 
graphy of Colonel Higginson. Few writers live to see 
a bibliography of their work that covers sixty-three years 
of literary activity, as this one does ; and it is still more 
remarkable that in using this little book, as the veteran 
author has used it since its appearance, he is reported 
as unable to find a single error of importance. Four of 
Mr. Higginson's books have been translated into French, 
three into German, one into Italian, and one into modem 
Greek. Considering the difficulty, the impossibility 
rather, of turning dialect into another tongue, one notes 
with surprise a French " Vie Militaire dans un Regiment 
Noir." Seventy-eight books and articles about Mr. Hig- 
ginson are entered in this interesting list.

Rural free delivery for libraries is following 
in the wake of rural free delivery of letters, and, ac- 
cordmg to reports, with equally happy results. A good 
illustration is furnished by the Free Library of Hagers- 
town, Maryland, whose library-wagon is now in the third 
year of its beneficent work of dispensing intellectual 
pabulum to the neighboring rural regions. Besides this, 
over sixty deposit stations are maintained throughout 
the county, and supplies of books are sent out regularly 
to numerous day schools and Sunday-schools. Although 
but five years old, this enterprising library circulates 
more than eighty-five thousand volumes annually with 
only about seventeen thousand volumes wherewith to 
achieve this result. Can a better record than this be 
shown ? ... 

The public library as an educational force 
is evidently growing in importance. An aggressively 
managed institution of this sort is that at Grand Rapids, 
Michigan, as appears from a recent circular issued by 
it under the title, " The Right Start," which is sent out 
to the yomig people of the city, with a personal letter 
from the librarian. " Have you ever thought of con- 
tinuing your education while you are at work ? " asks 
the circular; and it proceeds to make known the great 
educational opportimity open to all who choose to fre- 
quent the library, attend its free lecture courses, inspect 
its exhibitions, and read its books and periodicals. Such 
enterprise speaks well for the institution, and for the 
community in which it is located.

The smallest book ever printed has just been pub- 
lished at Padua by the Salmin Brothers. This miniature 
curiosity measures only ten by six millimetres (about 
three-eighths by one-quarter of an inch) — a veritable 
thumb-naU volume, or in fact much smaller than any but 
a Tom Thumb's thumb-nail. Each page has nine lines, 
and though the print is extremely small it is perfectly

The Hohenlohe Memoirs.* 



Since the publication of Busch's life and let- 
ters of Bismarck, no book has created the stir 
in official Germany that has been roused by the 
" Memoirs of Prince Chlodwig of Hohenlohe- 
Schillingsfuerst." Lieutenant Bilse's "//i einer 
kleinen Garnison " provoked indeed a tempest, 
but the teapot was small and soon emptied. 
This time, however, the matter is more serious. 
The Emperor has reproved the eldest son of the 
late Prince for permitting the indiscretion of 
publication ; he has shifted the responsibility 
upon his brother, Prince Alexander, and he in 
turn upon Professor Curtius ; while the latter 
blames the importunate publisher. Doubtless 
the printer's devil is the one idtimately to blame. 

Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillings- 
fuerst was a Bavarian statesman, and during 
the important years 1867-1870 was at the head 
of the Bavarian ministry. Prior to that time he 
had filled a series of diplomatic positions that 
took him, first or last, to nearly every European 
capital. As a prince of the blood and related 
to various royal houses, connected by intimate 
family ties with Protestantism though himself 
a Roman Catholic, possessed of great wealth 
and broad culture, he was not only brought into 
intimate connection with all the leading men of 
his time, but in his diplomatic career he was 
informed as to the negotiations that led to many 
a check and counter-check in the political game 
of modern Europe. As a member of the Reichs- 
tag after the establishment of the Empire, then 
as Ambassador at Paris from 1874 to 1885, and 
from 1885 to 1894 as governor at Strassburg, 
he was not only in close touch with Bismarck 
up to the latter's retirement from office, but 
was intimately associated with the Emperor 
William I. and his successors. From 1894 tiU 
almost the end of his life he was Imperial 
Chancellor, resigning from that office in the 
Autumn of 1900. 

Upon the occasion of his eighty-second birth- 
day, in March following his retirement from 
office, the Prince requested Professor Friedrich 
Curtius to help him write his memoirs. He did 
not, however, live even to begin the work, and 
the task of fulfilling his wishes was left to his 
son, Prince Alexander, with whom Professor

lingrsfuerst, and edited by Friedrich Curtius. English edition

Curtius collaborated. We have, then, not an 
autobiography, nor in the ordinary sense a bio- 
graphy, but instead an annotated compilation 
of material upon which the Prince had expected 
to draw in refreshing his memory and in round- 
ing out the story of his life. Private letters and 
journals constitute the bulk of this material, 
which has been made public, " so far," to quote 
Curtius, "as publication seems advisable." This 
limitation appears to have been taken somewhat 
easily, for certainly very much is included that 
so tactful a diplomat as Prince von Hohenlohe 
would have hesitated to give to the public. The 
struggle, resulting from aggression, compro- 
mise, and concession, out of which the national 
unity of Germany was born, is still so recent 
that it possesses personal rather than historical 
interest. To the historian of the next century 
these memoirs will be invaluable in portraying 
the characters of William I., Bismarck, and 
other leaders and participants in it ; but to-day 
many a statement must seem to those person- 
ally interested as a slur upon the memory of 
dear friends. 

A few instances of such indiscretion may be 
of interest. Thus, in speaking of the eightieth 
birthday of William I., the Prince mentioned 
in his diary a dinner at Bismarck's at which 
Marie von Bismarck told him that he was the 
only man upon whom her father could rely, and 
that he had often thought of him when he was 
tired of vexations and wanted to resign. The 
diary continues : 

" Afterwards I spoke with Gontaut. I think the Im- 
perial Chancellor attaches much too much importance 
to him. He is, after all, an insignificant chatterbox. In 
the same way Bismarck makes too much of the claptrap 
of the Empress." 

Agaui, in 1880, he sketches the situation as 
follows : 

" The Chancellor is at Varzin in a nervous state, and 
hesitates to come because he is afraid that the Kaiser 
and everyone else will give him too much to do here. 
The Kaiser is losing his memory to some extent, does 
not remember what he has signed, and becomes rude at 
times when he hears that something has happened which 
he thinks he has not been told about." 

Bismarck's feigning illness, and his continual 
threats of resigning, are repeatedly mentioned. 
Thus, in 1872 the Prince states : 

" Yesterday a rumor was spread that Bismarck was 
again unwell, and that he would have to retire to the 
country for six months. As I had seen him some few 
days previous looking fresh and healthy, I thought this 
was curious, and I expected he was simply playing 
truant. This was the case. Bismarck has difficulties 
with the Emperor. His powerful and imperious nature 
cannot stand the pressure which the old gentleman 
brings to bear upon him."

[Feb. 1, 



But enough ; such passages are of frequent 
occurrence. Whatever else they amount to, 
they certainly tend to obscure " the awe and 
majesty of kings " by bringing them down to a 
very human level ; and so they certainly do not 
tend to further the desire of William II. to 
have his grandfather go down to posterity as 
" WiUiam the Great." Indeed, one most inter- 
esting thing in the book is the way in which 
Prince von Hohenlohe was constantly called 
upon to be the " buifer " between Bismarck and 
William I. Sometimes his influence was sought 
by one party, sometimes by the other. Thus, 
in 1879, in the matter of the alliance with Aus- 
tria, Bismarck summoned the Prince, talked 
him over to his view, and then sent him to the 
Emperor. Bismarck was threatening to resign, 
the Emperor to abdicate ; but the Prince was 
able to settle the matter. In October, 1874, 
the Chancellor and the Emperor had some diffi- 
culty over the speech from the throne. The 
Emperor wished to " water down " what Bis 
march had written in regard to foreign affairs. 
The Prince thus reports his conversation with 
the Emperor : 

"The Emperor quoted the passage from memory, 
and said he feared it was open to the construction that 
we were prepared to make war again upon France. And 
this was out of the question. He was too old to begin 
another war, and feared that Prince Bismarck was try- 
ing to drag him little by little into fresh hostilities. 
This was why he was so suspicious. I said that if the 
Prince had any such intention I must have been the first 
to know of it, but that I had not the faintest inkling of 
anythmg of the kind. That passage of the speech 
referred not to coalitions against us, but to the insinua- 
tions that had been got up against us. The Emperor 
stroked his beard, and said, without replying to my 
argument, * I shall fall out with Prince Bismarck again 
over this matter, and it would gratify me if you would 
put it before him once more from my point of view.' " 

But to turn from this phase of the memoirs 
to those features that give the book more per- 
manent interest. One of the characteristics of 
statesmanship is the ability to read the signs of 
the times. This ability Prince von Hohenlohe 
possessed. Thus, in an article on the political 
condition of Germany in 1847 he points out that 
"It is a mistake to try to dam the Revolution 
by liberal reforms in the individual States with- 
out reforming Germany as a whole." He sin- 
cerely desired a united Germany, but what he 
wanted was " a real, politically efficacious unity," 
and till the various governments would approach 
the problem in a serious and self-sacrificing 
spirit he was opposed to the so-called progress 
and to concessions which he felt led directly to 
revolution. At this time he took the ground of 



an ultra-Conservative and opposed the Frank- 
furt resolution calling for a Constituent National 
Assembly, for he regarded it as practical an- 
archy. The subsequent course of events fuUy 
justified his position. His feeling toward the 
Church was much the same. In faith, he wanted 
something vital. Speaking of the fact that many 
educated men are either devoid of faith or accept 
the ordinances of the Church only as a matter 
of form, he says : 

" But will such conventional homage to the Church 
endure? Will not the effects of this knowledge without 
faith spread to those classes of society which can have 
no interest in subordinating themselves to the Church 
and hei^ dogmas, to the discipline and mortification 
which she imposes? Will not a total collapse be the 
end, or rather has it not even now begun to spread 
among the lower classes? . . . And if this result comes 
about, we must face the bankruptcy of faith, a catas- 
trophe which must infallibly lead to the collapse of the 
whole structure of modern civilization. For all that, it 
would be childish to regret the discoveries of natural 
science. They are for a wise and useful end, because 
they have their place in the development of mankind." 

At about the same date the Prince said, in 
another discussion of the same problem, " I be- 
lieve that mankind will create for itself a form of 
faith adapted to it, and become religious again." 
This certainly shows a broader outlook upon re- 
ligious matters, as well as a saner forecast of half 
a century's development, than can be claimed for 
many less orthodox believers than was Hohen- 
lohe ; indeed, he never seems to have shrimk 
from any advance that meant true progress. 

His attitude as a member of the Catholic 
Church and as a German patriot is strikingly 
shown in the following paragraph regarding the 
expulsion of the Jesuits : 

" I can never admit that a Jesuit can do anything 
independently of his superiors. The discipline of the 
Order is much too strict for that. ... If the Jesuits 
agitate in Posen and in Alsace, they do this under the 
command of their superiors, empowered by their Order; 
and for this it is answerable. When the Jesuit Father 
Schrader, in his book, The Pope and Modern Ideas, 
advanced a whole system of theories dangerous to the 
State ; if the Civilta Cattolica and the Korrespondenz of 
Geneva — the first under the eyes of the Pope, and the 
latter with his expressed approval — both being edited 
by Jesuits, both proclaim the sovereignty of the Church 
over the State ; when the local Bavarian papers, under 
the control of the Jesuit Father Weisser, daily preach the 
shattering of the State ; when the Osservatore Homano, 
conducted by Jesuits, reminds us that no heretic can be 
Emperor of Germany, that the Pope must dethrone him 
and the people drive him away, — then these are no 
'rash journalistic excesses,' but facts of such impor- 
tance that no one can shut his eyes to them. From the 
Catholic standpoint, it may be regrettable that we are 
not a Catholic country with a Catholic dynasty. But 
this objective complaint must not be made the spring 
of political action, and it can still less be tolerated that

anyone in Germany makes it the starting-point of an 
attack upon the Empire. Tliis the Jesuits have done 
since the institution of their Order, and to this they 
are committed, — that is, to the violent extermination 
of Protestantism. What will happen if we tolerate ten- 
dencies for which we have to thank the Thirty Years' 
War, and which can lead to nothing else than a renewal 
of the Wars of Religion? I am therefore always of the 
opinion that the German people must expel the Jesuits 
in self-defence ; and if you object that I, as a Catholic 
Prince, have no right to participate in this, I answer that 
I am in all things a German Prince, and as svich must do 
my duty." 

One exceedingly interesting feature of the 
memoirs is the light thrown upon the relations 
of Bismarck and the present Emperor of Ger- 
many. The question has been much discussed 
and much befogged, but in a passage in the 
journal is an account of a conversation in which 
the Emperor gives his version of the affair. 

" The Emperor related the whole story of his differ- 
ence with Bismarck without interruption. He said that 
relations had become strained as early as December. 
The Emperor then desired that something should be 
done upon the question of the workmen. The Chancellor 
objected. The Emperor's view was that if the Govern- 
ment did not take the initiative, the Reichstag — in 
other words, the Socialists, the Centre, and the Pro- 
gressives — would take the matter in hand, and that the 
Government would be forced to follow them. The 
Chancellor desired to bring the Socialist law, including 
the provisions of exjiulsion, before the new Reichstag 
once again, to dissolve the Reichstag if it rejected the 
law, and to take energetic measures in the event of a 
revolt. The Emperor objected to this policy, saying 
that if his grandfather had been forced to deal with 
rebels after a long and glorious reign, no one would 
have thought the worse of him. But he was himself in 
a different position, for he had as yet achieved nothing. 
. . . He was ready enough to act, but he wished to be 
able to act with a clear conscience, and first to make an 
attempt to satisfy the legitimate grievances of the 
workmen, and at least to do everything that was possi- 
ble to fulfil their justifiable demands. In a conference 
with his ministers, the Emperor therefore demanded 
that decrees should be drafted containing those pro- 
visions which the decrees afterward secured. Bismarck 
declined to hear of it. The Emperor then brought the 
matter before the Cabinet Coimcil, and eventually se- 
cured the proposal of the decrees notwithstanding Bis- 
marck's opposition. Bismarck, however, was secretly 
working against him. . . . This friction had consider- 
ably disturbed the relations between Bismarck and the 
Emperor, and these were further strained by the ques- 
tion of the Cabinet Order of 1852. Bismarck had often 
advised the Emperor to grant the ministers access to 
himself; and this was done. But when communication 
between the Emperor and his ministers became more 
frequent, Bismarck took offence, became jealous, and 
revived the Cabinet Order of 1852 in order to break 
communications between the Emperor and the minis- 
ters. The Emperor protested, and demanded the repeal 
of the Cabinet Order; Bismarck made a show of con- 
sent, but nothing was done in the matter. The Emperor 
therefore demanded that he should either issue an order 
of repeal or hand in his resignation. This decision the 



Emperor communicated through Hahnke. The Prince 
hesitated, but gave in his resignation on March 18. • . . 
The question at issue was, as the Emperor went on to 
say, whether the HohenzoUern dynasty or the Bismarck 
dynasty should reign." 

The memoirs afford delightful glimpses of the 
Prince's private life, of his genial and imperturb- 
able good temper, of his cultured appreciation 
of poetry and art. Space forbids further cita- 
tions, even when that is the only way to give a 
just impression of the work. The translation, 
supervised by Mr. George W. Chrystal, B. A., 
is satisfactory and apparently adequate. The 
typography is worthy of special commendation. 
The chief source of regret is that Prince von 
Hohenlohe did not live to supervise the prepa- 
ration of the work ; in that case those elements 
that have provoked censure would doubtless 
have been omitted, and the whole work rounded 
out into a biography in the ordinary sense of 
the term. Lewis A. Ehoades. 



The IjIbrariast and his Charge.* 



As long ago as the middle of the seventeenth 
century, to go no further back, the " librarie- 
keeper " was conscious of the dignity of his call- 
ing and the precious nature of his charge. A 
quaintly interesting series of reprints, styled 
collectively, " Literature of Libraries in the 
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries," is now 
appearing, under the careful editorship of Mr. 
John Cotton Dana, public librarian at Newark, 
N. J., and Mr. Henry W. Kent, librarian of the 
Grolier Club in New York. The first four num- 
bers of the set of six are Cotton des Houssayes's 
Sorbonne address on " The Duties and Qualifi- 
cations of a Librarian," John Durie's two letters 
to Samuel Hartlib on " The Reformed Librarie- 
Keeper,"' Rev. James Kirkwood's two tracts on 
founding parochial libraries in Scotland, and 
Sir Thomas Bodley's autobiography and first 
draft of statutes of the library founded by him 
at Oxford. 

It was in December, 17 80, that the modest and 
learned scholar, the Abbe Cotton des Houssayes 
(1727-1783), delivered his brief address, in 
Latin, on assuming a librarian's duties at the 
Sorbonne. Publication speedily followed, and

translations, in both French and English, have 
appeared. The version now printed claims to 
be only partly new, but it commends itseK to the 
reader as a scholarly piece of work. A selected 
passage emphasizing the librarian's high calling 
and needed qualifications will convey an idea of 
the whole. Throughout the treatise, its author 
shows himseK awake to his possibilities of use- 
fulness, and at the furthest possible remove from 
the position taken by that ease-loving Bodleian 
librarian who felt that his post would not be 

so very disagreeable if only the ed visitors 

would keep away. 

" Your librarian, gentlemen, is in some sort your 
official representative. To him is remitted the deposit 
of your glory. . . . Thus, therefore, your librarian 
should be, above all, a learned and profoimd theologian; 
but to this qualification, which I shall call fundamental, 
should be imited vast literary acquisitions, an exact and 
precise knowledge of all the arts and sciences, great 
facility of expression, and, lastly, that exquisite polite- 
ness which conciliates the affection of his visitors while 
his merit secures their esteem. A librarian truly worthy 
of the name should, if I may be permitted the expression, 
have explored in advance every region of the empire 
of letters, to enable him afterwards to serve as a faithful 
guide to all who may desire to survey it." 

Emerson's slighting reference to the librarian 
as a man in whom we are not to look for learning 
merely because he lives among books, would 
have certainly incensed the erudite Abbe. His 
discourse, though not exceeding two thousand 
words in length, is full of sensible ideas, and 
ideas which, however familiar now, must have 
appeared " advanced " in the speaker's day. 
The editors' bibliographical and prefatory mat- 
ter is all that could be desired ; and the compo- 
sition, press-work, and binding of the book are 
equally excellent. 

The Letters of John Durie (1596-1680) on 
" The Reformed Librarie-Keeper " antedate the 
Abbe's little tract by a century and a quarter. 
The writer's active and somewhat troubled life 
as a religious reformer receives due attention 
in an introductory " Biographical Sketch " by 
Miss Ruth Shepard Granniss ; but the occur- 
rence of the word " graft," even in quotation 
marks, tends to give one a slight shock, as a 
little out of keeping with the tone, the atmos- 
phere, the sober decorum of the little volume as 
a whole. Durie's friendship with Samuel Hart- 
lib, and his family connection, as father-in-law, 
with Henry Oldenburg, bring him indirectly 
into interesting association with Milton. The 
biographical sketch informs us that " in 1649 
Bidstrode Whitelock was appointed keeper of 
the king's medals and library," and that John 
Durie was soon afterward named as his assistant. 



Strictly speaking, of course, at the time of 
these appointments the medals and library could 
not be called " the king's ",- but whether serv 
ing king or parliament or commonwealth, Durie 
was assistant library-keeper for a few years 
before he resumed his restless wanderings and- 
his unsuccessful labors for Protestant unity. 
No whit less than our French Abbe did he feel 
the dignity of his calling and the great future 
opening to all library workers, as a brief extract 
will make evident. 

" For if Librarie-keepers did understand themselvs 
in the nature of their work, and would make themselvs, 
as they ought to bee, useful in their places in a publiek 
waie; they ought to becom Agents for the advancement 
of universal Learning: and to this effect I could wish, 
that their places might not bee made, as everie where 
they are, Mercenarie, but rather Honorarie; and that 
with the competent allowance of two himdred pounds 
a year; som emploiments should bee put upon them 
further than a bare keeping of the Books." 

What some of these " emploiments " are, he 
proceeds to specify; and it almost startles the 
reader to find how many modem ideas are 
clothed in his quaint and antique phraseology 
and spelling. He very sensibly favors an expan- 
sive system of book location, but his scheme of 
classification is amusingly rudimentary to a 
twentieth-century librarian. This little volume, 
like its companion, is irreproachable in style 
and finish. Yet one queries why the editors 
chose to depart from the old spelling of Durie's 
name, printing it " Dury," which would have 
looked strange to its owner. 

" An Overture for Founding and Maintain- 
ing Bibliothecks in every Paroch throughout 
the Kingdom," published anonymously at Edin- 
burgh in 1699, is now, we are assured by its 
present editors, a tract of great rarity. Its 
authorship is traced to the Presbyterian minister, 
James Kirkwood (1650-1708), a brief sketch 
of whose life precedes the reprint of the above- 
named tract, to which is added a second, dealing 
with the same general subject, and entitled " A 
Copy of a Letter anent a Project for erecting a 
Library in every Presbytery, or at least County, 
in the Highlands." It is by means of this second 
little treatise that the authorship of the first is 
determined, but when or where it was originally 
published, the editors do not say ; nor do they 
venture any assertion as to whether our philan- 
thropists endeavors bore fruit. Undoubtedly 
he was ahead of his age : the times were not ripe 
for public libraries. Yet the ultimate results of 
his zeal may have been considerable. Among 
other curious details of his scheme is one whereby 
the time allowed for retaining each volume was

to depend on its size and the distance of the 
borrower s home from the library. Our first 
subscription library, that founded by Franklin 
in Philadelphia, had a somewhat similar rule. 
The exalted motives to Kirkwood's exertions in 
this field find partial expression in the following 
sentence : 

" Seeing God hath made all men by nature desirous 
pf Knowledge, undoubtedly the satisfying of this desire, 
must be a considerable part of our natural felicity; for 
the only delight of our Souls, which are our better part, 
in which the Body doth not partake, is the delight She 
taketh in Knowledge and Contemplation." 

Mr. Birrell's pleasant essay, " In the Name 
of the Bodleian," which forms 'the title-chapter 
to his latest collection of essays, must have 
aroused in many readers a fresh interest in Sir 
Thomas Bodley (1544-1613), foimder of the 
famous Oxford University library that bears 
his name. The fourth number of the series 
under review contains his " Life," written by 
himself, and his " First Draught of the Statutes 
of the Public Library at Oxon." A preface by 
Miss Granniss gives further details about both 
the man and his library to eke out the modest 
record he himself has given of his doings. Of 
his benefactions to the imiversity where he both 
studied and taught, he says very little, according 
more space to his honors and achievements as a 
diplomat, but limiting his entire autobiography 
(written in 1609) to some three thousand words. 
His " Statutes " run to nearly twice that length, 
and from them we take a short passage to 
illustrate the benevolent writer's old-fashioned 
charm of style. 

" Above all things, that may concern the Preservation 
of this our publick Place of Study, or the Benefit, Use, 
and Ease of those that shall frequent it, it is deemed 
expedient, that some one be deputed to the Custody of 
it, that is noted and known for a diligent Student, and in 
all his Conversation to be Trusty, Active, and Discreet ; 
a Graduat also, and a Linguist, not encumbred with Mar- 
riage, nor with a Benefice of Cure. For it cannot stand 
with piety, that such a Charge should admit the continual 
Society of other publick Imployments ; and Marriage is 
too full of Domestical Impeachments, to afford him so 
much time from his private Affairs, as almost every 
Day's necessity of his private Presence will require." 

Bodley's regard for books amounted almost 
to reverence. Remembering the sad fate of 
previous public collections of books at Oxford, 
he prescribed a penalty of instant and igno- 
minious ejection from the university for so 
much as making " any Change in any Line or 
Lines, Word or Words, Syllable or Letter, in 
any Author whatsoever," or for being even an 
involuntary witness to such wicked act without 
denouncing the offender within three days. This 
volume is marked by the same excellence of 



workmanship that characterizes the other three. 
As a whole, this series promises to be a delight 
to the bibliophile as well as to the librarian.

The Red Planet Mars.* 



During the present year the planet Mars, 
which has given astronomers so merry a chase 
during the past few years, arrives at one of the 
favorable oppositions when its distance from 
the earth will be less than forty millions of 
miles, and details upon its surface will therefore 
be more easily seen than they usually are. 
Since public curiosity will soon be aroused, 
there is a certain timeliness in the nearly sim- 
ultaneous publication of two books upon our 
interesting neighbor. 

The first of these is an essay by Professor 
E. S. Morse, who has spent most of his long life 
in zoological studies. The study of life upon the 
earth has produced in him an intense interest in 
the question as to whether intelligent life exists 
in other worlds. Believing that any man pos- 
sessing a fair amount of intelligence is compe- 
tent to make a critical estimate of the work of 
astronomers upon Mars, he has essayed the task 
of sitting as judge upon their labors, of sifting 
the observational evidence at hand and pro- 
nouncing judgment in no hesitant fashion. The 
reader must not expect to find in the book the 
calm attitude of the man of science who looks 
at the matter in hand from all sides, examines 
the evidence pro and con, and then states his 
conclusions with the modesty which befits one 
who is aware of the uncertainties pertaining to 
the subject. The present author takes the view- 
point, rather, of the special pleader, marshals 
the evidence that bolsters up the theory he is 
advancing, ridicules opinions divergent from his 
own, and leaves the reader in a state of wonder 
as to what argmnents might be advanced on the 
other side of the question. Such a course, how- 
ever, when adopted by a man whose rhetorical 
ability is undoubted, at least leads to the pro- 
duction of a very readable book.

ment is as follows : First, life in other worlds 
is inherently probable. Second, a network of 
lines marks the surface of Mars. Third, the 
lines are most easily accoimted for on the sup- 
position that they mark the courses of irrigating 
canals. Fourth, these irrigating canals have 
been constructed by intelligent beings. This 
simple line of argument the author elaborates, 
enlivening nearly every chapter with personal 
allusions to well-known astronomers who have 
had the fortime, or the misfortune, to express 
opinions upon Mars. He has apparently 
overstepped the limits of polite language vhen 
he makes the following comments upon some 
astronomers and astronomical writers whom he 
mentions by name : 

" But what could we expect of the mentality of the 
senior assistant of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, 
who, with the great vault of heaven crowded with 
enigmas awaiting an answer, should waste a particle of 
gray matter in trying to ascertain precisely where Joshua 
stood when he commanded the Sun to stand still so that 
he could have a little more time for his bloody work." 

" I appeal to any honest and unprejudiced mind if a 
more incompetent person of the class to which he belongs 
could have been foxmd in England for the Directorship 
of such a body." 

"His attempt is as childish and ridiculous as the 
theory he conjures up." 

" This is certainly a happy thought of the reverend 
author, only it would seem in this case that a larger and 
more diversified corps of specialists, including alienists, 
is needed to attend to that class of astronomers who are 
suffering from mental strabismus. It might be advisa- 
ble to call in the services of a bacteriologist to make 
cultures of new forms of microbes which may be in- 
volved in rendering men incapable of estimating the 
value of evidence." 

Professor Morse spent a month at the Lowell 
Observatory in Arizona, where he was given 
opportunity to observe Mars on every clear night 
with the 24-inch telescope. Here he came to ap- 
preciate the difficidties connected with the study 
of the system of canals. On pages 80-81 he 
describes his initial sensations. 

" Imagine my surprise and chagrin when I first saw 
the beautiful disk of Mars through this superb telescope. 
Not a line ! not a markuig ! The object I saw could only 
be compared in appearance to the open mouth of a cru- 
cible filled with molten gold. Slighter discolorations 
here and there and evanescent areas outlined for the 
tenth of a second, but not a determinate line or spot to 
be seen. Had I stopped that night, or even a week 
later, I might have joined the ranks of certain observers 
and said ' Illusion,' or something worse. And right here 
it was that my experience with microscopic work helped 
me ; for, remembering the hours — nay, days — I had 
worked in making out structural features in delicate 
organisms which my unprofessional friends could not see 
at all, I realized that patient observation would be re- 
quired if I was to be successful in my efforts. My despair, 
however, was overwhelming when Professor Lowell and 
his assistants, looking for a few moments at the same 



object, would draw on paper the features which had been 
plainly revealed to them, consisting of definite shaded 
regions, a number of canals and other markings, of which, 
with the utmost scrutiny, I could hardly detect a trace." 

In replying to the natural objection that 
physical conditions on Mars may be so very 
different from those on the earth that such forms 
of life as we know may not be able to exist 
there, the author has written a very interesting 
chapter in which he shows the astonishing va- 
riety of circmnstances under which life of various 
forms exists upon the earth. Animals of mar- 
vellous delicacy live at the bottom of the ocean 
in darkness and imder a pressure of many tons 
to the square inch. Some forms of plant-life 
thrive in water nearly at the freezing point, and 
others exist in that which is almost ready to 
boil. Even men live in temperatures ranging 
from 130° in the shade to 70° below zero ; they 
can work at an altitude of 19,000 feet, or under 
an atmospheric pressure of twenty-five or thirty 
pounds to the square inch, without injury. 

Anyone who is at all interested in the ques- 
tion of the existence of intelligent life in other 
worlds may well pass a pleasant evening in 
perusing the pages of this entertaining book. 

Of a very different sort is Professor Lowell's 
latest book on " Mars and Its Canals." Eleven 
years ago he issued a very attractive popular 
work on this subject, and during this interval 
he and his assistants have assiduously observed 
the ruddy planet at every favorable opportunity. 
These observations have strongly confirmed the 
opinions originally expressed by Professor 
LoweU, and have enabled him to fill in details 
in gratifying fashion. The observations have 
been made at his private observatory at Flag- 
staff, Arizona, where a 24-inch glass, of Alvan 
G. Clark's workmanship, is mounted at an ele- 
vation of eight thousand feet above the sea. In 
order to make out delicate planetary detail, it 
is absolutely necessary that the atmosphere at 
the observing station be both clear and steady. 
One who merely works with a microscope in 
the quiet air of a laboratory has no adequate 
conception of the difficulty of seeing minute 
details when one has to look through many miles 
of an agitated atmospheric ocean, laden with 
dust and water vapor, and often charged with 
ice-spiculae in its upper layers. 

Apart from the question of the existence and 
function of the Martian canals, the author be- 
lieves that the following conclusions, from his own 
observations and those of others, are reasonable : 
First, that Mars has days and seasons substan- 
tially like our own. Second, that its enveloping 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



77 



atmosphere contains water vapor, carbonic acid, 
and oxygen, and is quite rare, the barometric 
pressure being probably no greater than four 
inches. Third, that water is very scarce, as 
shown by the infrequency of clouds and the 
rapid melting of the polar caps in summer. 
Fourth, that the temperature is colder than ours, 
but above the freezing point of water except in 
winter and the extreme polar regions. Fifth, 
that vegetation springs up when the polar snows 
melt, and dies away in due course. 

The difficulty of the observations which lie 
at the basis of all reasonable theorizinsr about 
the much-discussed system of canals and the 
existence of intelligent beings on the planet, 
may weU be described in Professor Lowell's 
own words. 

" When a fairly acute-eyed observer sets himself to 
scan the telescopic disk of the planet in steady air, he 
will, after noting the dazzling contour of the white 
polar cap and the sharp outlines of the blue-green seas, 
of a sudden be made aware of a vision as of a thread 
stretched somewhere from the blue-green across the 
orange areas of the disk. Gone as quickly as it came, he 
will instinctively doubt his own eyesight, and credit to 
illusion what can so unaccountably disappear. Gaze 
as hard as he will, no power of his can recall it, when, 
with the same startling abruptness, the thing stands 
before his eyes again. Convinced, after three or four 
such showings, that the vision is real, he will still be 
left wondering what and where it was. For so short 
and sudden are its apparitions that the locating of it is 
dubiously hard. It is gone each time before he has got 
its bearings. By persistent watch, however, for the best 
instants of definition, backed by a knowledge of what 
he is to see, he wiU find its comings more frequent, 
more certain, and more detailed. At last some partic- 
ularly propitious moment will disclose its relation to 
well-known points and its position be assured. First, 
one such thread and then another will make its presence 
evident ; and then he will note that each always appears 
in place. Repetition in situ will convince him that these 
strange visitants are as real as the main markings, and 
are as permanent as they. . . . Not everybody can see 
these delicate features at first sight, even when pointed 
out to them; and to perceive their more minute details 
takes a trained as well as an acute eye, observing under 
the best conditions." 

Our author has devoted haK his book to a 
detailed description of observations of the canals 
and to theories as to their nature and origin. 
These tantalizing objects were even photo- 
graphed ; joyfvd was the day when this feat was 
accomplished ! 

" The eagerness with which the first plate was scanned 
as it emerged from its last bath may be imagined, and 
the joy when on it some of the canals could certainly 
be seen! There were the old configurations of patches, 
the light areas and the dark, just as they looked through 
the telescope, and never till then otherwise seen of hu- 
man eye, and there more marvelous yet were the grosser 
of those lines that had so piqued human curiosity, the 
canals of Mars. ... By chance on one of the plates a 



temporal event was found registered too, the first snow- 
fall of the season, the beginning of the new polar cap, 
seen visually just before the plate happened to be put 
in and reproduced by it unmistakably. Upon the many 
images thirty-eight canals were counted in all, and one 
of them, the NUokeras, double. Thus did the canals at 
last speak for their own reality themselves." 

We are now ready to ask for an explanation 
of the nature of these delicate markings. The 
author shows that their complex behavior may 
be accounted for by a theory which he unhesitat- 
ingly advocates. This theory is that there are 
narrow waterways extending in a complete net- 
work over the surface of Mars ; when the polar 
snows melt, the released water flows equator- 
wards through these waterways, quickening 
vegetation along their banks and causing it to 
develop from the polar regions onward. This 
vegetation flourishes for a time, dies out, and is 
again renewed seasonally. If we grant that 
vegetation somewhat similar to our own exists, 
the author asks us to admit that animal life, 
which is closely coexistent with vegetable life on 
the earth, is likewise associated with it on Mars. 
On page 358 he says : 

" Once started, life, as palaeontology shows, develops 
along both the floral and faunal lines side by side, taking 
on complexity with time. It begins so soon as secular 
cooling has condensed water vapor into its liquid state; 
chromaceafe and confervse coming into being high up 
toward the boiling point. Then with lowering temper- 
ature come the sea-weeds and the rhizopods, then the 
land plants and the lunged vertebrates. Hand in hand 
the flora and fauna climb to more intricate perfecting, 
life rising as temperature lowers." 

Professor Lowell believes that the water 
would not flow along the canals from a pole 
downward across the equator unless artificially 
helped ; this help he ascribes to beings of a high 
order of intelligence, who have fashioned the 
canal system. He calls particidar attention to 
the fact that the canals connect small round 
dark spots which are scattered over the planet's 
face, going with geometrical precision straight 
from one " oasis " to another. These " oases " 
he considers centres of population. The popu- 
lation he esteems " necessarily intelligent " and 
of a " non-bellicose character." How firm his 
conviction is may be judged from the first sen- 
tence of the last chapter, which reads as follows : 

" That Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort or 
other, we may consider as certain as it is uncertain what 
those beings may be." 

Whether the reader can accept the author's 
conclusions or not, he will at least be forced to 
admit, after reading " Mars and Its Canals," 
that the book is an exceedingly able and inter- 
esting exposition of the subject.

The Record oe a Scholarly Life.* 



The life of a scholar in nineteenth-century 
England, inclined by temperament and iU-health 
to the quiet content to be sought far from the 
madding crowd, leaves a literary record without 
stir of adventure or thrill of triumph, but one 
eagerly appreciated by such as are sympathetic 
with the charm of letters. George Birkbeck Hill, 
best known for his notable edition of Boswell's 
Johnson, found in heredity and environment a 
potent shaping of his fate. Son and grandson 
of a schoolmaster, he, along with his brothers, 
was early initiated into preceptorial service in 
the family's large boarding-school for boys, of 
which for eighteen years he in turn served as 
partner or master. The natural path for the 
career led through Oxford, which he entered in 
1855 at the age of twenty. There the deter- 
mining influences — a not uncommon experi- 
ence — were his companions, a notable group of 
young men who presently formed themselves 
into a club which they called the " Old Mor- 
tality." The names of the original members 
are, almost without exception, now in the rolls 
of the distinguished : Professor Nichol, Pro- 
fessor Dicey, Mr. Swinburne, Professor Thomas 
Hill Green, the Right Honorable James Bryce, 
Dr. Caird (Master of Baliol), Dr. Birkbeck 
Hill, and Mr. Justice Wright. An equally 
intimate companion was William Morris. A 
contemporary, not of the club, records that 
"they were a revolutionary set, and read 
Browning." 

Young Hill's Oxford letters were divided 
between his father and Miss Scott (to whom he 
was early engaged, and who became his helpful 
life-mate), with a natural preponderance, both 
in number and intimacy, in favor of the latter. 
Here is one of them : 

" Yesterday I was in Swinburne's rooms. I wish yon 
knew the little fellow ; he is the most enthusiastic fellow 
I ever met, and one of the cleverest. He wanted to read 
me some poems he had written, and have my opinion. 
They are really very good, and he read them with such 
an earnestness, so truly feeling everything he had 
written, that I for the first time in my life enjoyed 
hearing the poetry of an amateur." 

In 1857 the " Old Mortality " club became 
responsible for a magazine, to the first issue of 
which Birkbeck Hill contributed his maiden 
literary effort in the form of a story. Mr. Swin- 
burne's contributions were essays on " Early 
Dramatists " and " Modern Hellenism " (aimed

at " our Professor of Poetry, Matthew Arnold "), 
and the poem " Queen Yseult "; and it was 
Swinburne who assembled the enthusiastic com- 
pany in his rooms "to welcome in the little 
stranger." But the printer was late. 

" Though we had not the satisfaction of having the 
paper itself, we still managed to drink its health in very 
good claret, as well as the health of each contributor, 
and the absent editor [Nichol] also. So we made very 
merry indeed; and though the baby was not there, still 
the christening was very successful." 

The arduous labors connected with the man- 
agement of the school at Bruce Castle, Totten- 
ham, and the cares of their own large family, 
became ever more wearing. In 1877 Dr. Hill 
and his wife gave up the ^chool and removed to 
Burgfield, near Reading. His life from now on 
was that of a man of letters with precarious 
income, rendered more so by the almost chronic 
interruptions of ill-health. While yet a school- 
master he had become a constant reviewer, and 
in 1874 had brought out a little book, " Dr. 
Johnson, his Friends and his Critics," a venture 
upon which, according to Mrs. Hill's careful 
accounting, he lost just <£3. In 1879 his uncle 
Sir Rowland Hill died, and Birkbeck Hill be- 
came the biographer of the founder of Penny 
Postage. The next year he performed a similar 
service in bringing out the Letters of Colonel 
Gordon from Central Africa. The three years 
from 1883 to 1886 were devoted wholly to the 
magnum opus, the six-volume edition of Boswell; 
and in the last of those years, in the interests 
of the work, he removed to Oxford. An edition 
of "Rasselas," also of "The Traveller" and 
the Letters of Hume, and a selection of John- 
son's writings imder the title " The Wit and 
Wisdom of Dr. Johnson," were the contribu- 
tions of 1888 ; in 1890 appeared the " Foot- 
steps of Dr. Johnson," and in 1892 a collection 
of Dr. Johnson's Letters. Some lectures given 
by Dr. HiU in 1891 were made up into a little 
volume, "Writers and Readers." In 1893 Dr. 
Hill visited America ; and the experience bore 
fruit in an accoimt of "Harvard College, by 
an Oxonian," while his contributions to " The 
Atlantic Monthly " became a sheaf of " Talks 
about Autographs." 

The charm of Dr. Hill's personality instantly 
made itself felt in almost any company. His 
comment upon his coUege friend Faulkner — 
later of the famous art firm of Morris, Marshall, 
Faulkner & Co. — " It would never occur to him 
whether a man were a duke or a chimney-sweep," 
may appropriately be applied to himself. On 
the whole, he woidd have preferred the chimney-

sweep, if we may judge by the following letter 
to the same Faulkner (1879) : 

" Can you not give me a day or two here on your way 
back to Oxford ? . . . I met Morris in coming here 
yesterday, and travelled down with him. . . . Have you 
any work to do, here is your place to do it. We have 
risen a step — a very great step in the world — since we 
last saw you. The County has at last called on us, in 
the shape of the Right Honourable I re- 
turned the call, and was plunged in the midst of a lawn- 
tennis party. I was taken past a bench of young ladies 

and seated by Mrs. . When once there, I 

dared not move. I was conscious that I was staying too 
long, but I could not face the young ladies again. There 
were some military swells there in great yellow mus- 
taches. I was in a flannel shirt. How I suffered ! Lord ! 
— I mean Right Hon! — what is man that thou so re- 

gardest him ! Old himself was not bad, but the 

swells and swellesses ! I will introduce you to them, 
and we will talk in our most Radical style, and damn all 
parsons and squires, and speak disrespectfully of the 
House of Lords. The worst of me is that while I can 
roar like a lion in writing, I am as fearful and weak- 
voiced as a mouse before respectable people. You shall 
be Moses and the spokesman, and I will be a chorus." 

Dr. Hill's candor and sincerity of thought and 
speech made it quite impossible for him to deal 
tolerantly with presumption, duplicity, privilege, 
or dogmatism. He was liberal in politics and re- 
ligion, as in letters. Accurate, considerate, with 
a scholar's standards and ideals, the whole- 
80uledn6ss of his interest made him as eager in 
one occupation as in another. The most delightful 
of companions, an adored friend of children (some 
of his charming writings to the little ones have 
been gathered in " Letters of a Grandfather " ), 
he carried with him the subtle attraction of hav- 
ing only to be himself to be at once your friend. 
Straightforward in thought, and with keen in- 
sights, his opinions were sound as well as incisive, 
while over all there played the genial humor of a 
kindly simplicity. Good talk he enjoyed, and 
practised his own preaching. 

" It ought to be taught as one of the chief duties of 
life that each one is bound so to train and store his mind 
that he may take his part in pleasant and general talk. 
' Thou shalt not bore thy neighbor ' might well be added 
to the Commandments." 

These qualities impart to his letters (which, it 
must be remembered, are for the most part the 
intimate communion of husband and wife, of a 
father with his children) at once a sterling interest 
and a personal charm. Always ready for foolery 
and the lighter vein, he ever gave a serious sub- 
ject serious attention. Thoughts, as men, he 
valued for their real worth. Reputation, conven- 
tion, the sanction of majorities or superficial 
consideration, influenced him little. His com- 
ment upon a bit of fine writing in Renan is char- 
acteristic : " There is one passage about beautiful 



women which might have been written by at least 
ten thousand French fools, and so should not have 
been written by Renan." 

His interest in America, though brought to the 
venture of two trans- Atlantic journeys through 
the marriage of a daughter to Professor Ashley, 
sometime professor at Harvard University, was 
dominantly in a land in which worth had an un- 
trammelled chance to assert itself. " There are 
four great cradles of liberty in the world — so I 
reckon them — Greece, Holland, England and 
New England." He focussed his attention upon 
one of our institutions which it was well that the 
English cousin should comprehend . He willingly 
records, " What progress Harvard is making ! 
She strides while our Universities crawl." Yet 
he equally brought forward the benefits of seeing 
ourselves as others see us ; and a dozen years' 
experience vindicate the sharp-sightedness of the 
Oxonian spectacles. Not the least of our short- 
comings — the reviewer may be permitted to add, 
not out of harmony with the spirit of Dr. Hill's; 
strictures — is that we offer so little incentive 
and provide so sparingly for the living of such 
scholarly lives as that so pleasantly recorded in 
the letters of George Birkbeck HlU.

Withstanding the Gods.* 



" Love thou the gods and withstand them, lest thy fame 
should fail at the end, 
And thou be but their thrall and bondsman, who wast 
bom for their very friend." 

With this quotation from Sigurd the Volsung, 
Mr. Garrod begins his book, " The Religion of 
all Good Men." " I could ahnost think," he 
says on a later page, " I could almost think it 
the last word in religion." 

It is the great merit of this little work, that 
it excites those very sentiments which its author 
regards as appropriate to religion. As we read, 
we not only admire the writer's eloquence and 
originality, but we come to have a sympathetic 
affection for his personality ; and yet we are 
stirred up to wrestle with his arguments, in 
default of that personal encounter for which we 
instinctively yearn. In the preface we are offered 
a sort of excuse for the book. 

" What I want to say needs, I think, at this time to be 
said by somebody ; and it is better that I should say it 
imperfectly than that nobody should say it at all. . . . 
And let me here say this: there is a danger that I may 
change my opinions. But there is also a danger that I

may lose the courage of them. Ten years hence I may 
have the courage only of other people's opinions. My 
environment [Oxford] is one where the ' shades of the 
prison-house ' too early close in upon youthful enthusi- 
asm. Sooner than elsewhere, one ceases to be * on his 
way attended by the Vision splendid,' and begins to think 
and feel and speak conventionally and academically. 
Everywhere around me I hear the praise of the ' middle 
course,' of compromise, of suspended judgment; and I 
see the love of truth corrupted into the sophistic pas- 
sion for believing both sides of a contradiction. I see 
the folks of my little world the victims, all of them, of 
one or two diseases — the disease of having no opinions 
(' the balanced mind ') or the disease of not expressing 
them (' moderation '). Yet we all know that the just 
balance is motionless: nor have we ever seen in history 
intellectual progress born of an elegant laissez-faire." 

And so, secretly aware of the cheerful — nay, 
enthusiastic — permission of the discriminating, 
and scornful of the protests of the multitude, 
this extraordinary Fellow proceeds to correct 
some of the most ancient misunderstandings of 
our Christian world. In the first section, headed 
" Christian, Greek, or Goth," it is maintained 
that in addition to Christianity and Hellenism 
we have a third but little-recog-nized force, which 
is Northern or Gothic in origin. It is suggested 
that whereas historical Christianity has in the 
past come in for a great deal of criticism, it is 
now rather ethical Christianity that is being 
called into question. Both Christianity and 
Hellenism have been tried and found wanting ; 
or if not so found, it has been because they have 
been combined with another element essentially 
distinct in its nature and origin, though not 
recognized as such. 

" The ideal of Christianity is what we may call holi- 
ness. The ideal of Hellenism may be said to be under- 
standing, or intelligence. . . . Two ideals, chivalry and 
honor, are neither Greek nor Christian: I take them to 
be the peculiar property and creation of the northern 
races. I may call them the cardinal virtues of Gothic 
morality." 

And again : 

" Christianity has said, ' In my flesh dwelleth no good 
thing.' . . . Against that, chivalry is a brilliant and pow- 
erful, though erratic, protest. ... It had also accounted 
those alone blessed who, in the cause of Christ, had 
made themselves * as the filth of the world and the off- 
scourings of all things unto this day.' . . . Against all 
that, so unnatural, so pusillanimous, so impossible, the 
ideal of honor is a righteous and necessary and enduring 
protest. ' I am a man of peace,' says Clough's Dipsychus : 

' I am a man of peace, 
And the old Adam of the gentleman 
Dares seldom in my bosom stir against 
The mild plebeian Christian seated there.' 
But it is to the motions in the blood of this old Adam 
that European society, as I believe, owes, and has always 
owed, its salvation." 

To most, this will seem in some degree ex- 
travagant,; and yet, who can suppose that the 



northern civilization, so rich in the mingling 
currents of humanity, has not contributed some- 
thing to the religious life of its members? In 
the language of the naturalist, should there not 
be some endemic forms within this territory ? — 
and if so, are they not likely to be the most 
characteristic, the most precisely adapted to this 
pecidiar environment ? 

In a later chapter, " Christ the Forerunner," 
Mr. Garrod sets forth a new view of Christ and 
his mission, which explains in many ways his 
attitude toward Christianity, and his circum- 
scription of it regarded as an original force. 
Christ, it is urged, taught and believed that the 
end of the world, or at least the end of ordinary 
human institutions, was close at hand. Paul 
was of the same opinion. Consequently, their 
religion, as actually held and presented, is by 
no means applicable to the life of normal men 
and women. Nor is this all. Numerous and 
apparently plausible reasons are adduced for 
believing that Christ did not so much as claim 
to be the Messiah, and that the " Son of Man," 
so frequently referred to by him, was not him- 
self but another. It is impossible here to sum- 
marize the argiunent, but the least we can say 
of it is that it is extremely interesting ; and we 
cannot deny the fact, urged by the author, that 
whereas the Gospel is everywhere read, few there 
are who examine it critically. 

What, then, of Christianity, after all ? If it 
has been crassly misunderstood, and made to 
cover in name quite other things, if it is in itself 
unsuited for human needs, what of it ? Was the 
mission of Christ a failure ? Not so. 

" In the long and learned introduction prefixed to his 
edition of the Bible (dated 1813), by the Rev. John 
Brown, I read that ' Perhaps about A. D. 2860 or 3000 
Satan will be again loosed from his long restraint; 
and, after corrupting the members of the Church, will 
assemble the Turks, Russians, or others of a savage 
temper, to destroy her: but the fearful vengeance of 
God shall overtake them in their attempt. Then cameth 
the end of the world, at what distance we know not.' This 
irruption of Satan, tliis high-handed action of Turkey 
and Russia, this end of all things, those who read these 
lines will be able to await with equanimity in a different 
place from this. The Rev. John Brown has gone thither 
before us ; but he may be allowed to speak to us a kind 
of allegory. 

" The year 2860 is ever upon us daily: daily is Satan 
unloosed, and peoples ' of a savage temper ' arm them- 
selves against the truth of God: the end of aU things is 
ever staring us in the face. John was right, Jesus was 
right, St. Paul was right, when each proclaimed the imme- 
diate coming of the Kingdom of God. It comes daily 
when Satan (that is. Sin and Ignorance and the Pride 
which either engenders) is cast down by the power of 
Justice and Right, Knowledge and Simplicity: when 
' men of a savage temper ' are diverted from their wrath

by the soft answer of good-sense. It comes daily to all 
who, without losing interest in life, or the healthy sense 
of the world, yet feel that all their actions look to an end 
that is not on earth; to the man who through the day 
keeps his eyes upon the duties of the day to do them, 
who is just, kind, moderate, healthy-minded, who also 
at the close of each day goes out at his door, and, lifting 
his eyes from the earth, looks awhile at ' the unnumbered 
stars of God,' though he stand there without speech or 
prayer — to such an one the Kingdom of Heaven comes 
daily. For that which sent John to the dungeon, Christ 
to the Cross, Paul to the block, each filled with the faith 
of the instant coming of the Lord, was none else than 
this — the sense, which should be in each one of us, of 
a perfection ever about to be attained, a joy and peace 
ever about to be realized. He who has not this sense 
of the ideal may, as truly as he that lacks ' charity,' be 
counted dead before God." 

I have tried to present all this without dis- 
pute, not because there is any lack of oppor- 
tunity for controversy, but because I think the 
worth of the book very far outweighs such 
faults as it may possess — these latter being, 
indeed, such necessary accompaniments of per- 
fect straightforwardness that we could not wish 
them absent. It will do any man good to read 
such virile words, — and if they harm him, he is 
not worthy to withstand the gods.

For the hunter 
of antiques. 



" The true collector," says Mrs. N. 
Hudson Moore in one of the chapters 
of her delightful " Collector's Man- 
ual " (F. A. Stokes Co. ), " when once embarked on his 
career, is seldom content to keep in one narrow path, 
but strays out in many directions, and finds pleasure 
in them all." Many a " true collector " will agree 
with Mrs. Moore, and be grateful to her for offering 
him in one volume information about a number of 
the main branches of that complex and fascinating 
subject, the collecting of antiques. Mrs. Moore has 
already written in separate volumes, and more ex- 
haustively, of china, brass and pewter, lace, and old 
furniture ; but the true collector is generally poor, 
because of the temptations that collecting offers, and 
he will be glad, particularly if he is a beginner in need 
of general information, to be able to get so much of 
it, concisely put and lavishly illustrated, in one mod- 
erate-priced volume. About half the book is given 
to various articles of furniture. An account of the 
origin of each article is given, and extracts from old 
wills, diaries, or inventories prove its existence and 
importance at early dates. Various good styles are 
illustrated, as well as a few "faked " or " restored " 
ones, to put the novice on his guard. Mrs. Moore 
aims to arouse enthusiasm as well as to cultivate 
taste. She does not forget that the quest of a bargain 
and the amusing and sometimes amazing adventures 



that the quest entails make up a good part of the fun 
for the " true collector "; so she sprinkles her pages 
with lively anecdotes of her own and her friends' 
experiences. Her own pet fad, she confesses, is the 
collecting of "cottage ornaments," which is the 
trade name for the quaint Staffordshire figures of 
shepherds and shepherdesses, well-known people, or 
animals, particularly sheep and dogs. This is a field 
comparatively new to the average collector, and almost 
nothing has hitherto been written about it. Old glass- 
ware, brass and copper, pewter, and a few of the 
best-known English chinas, are Mrs. Moore's other 
topics. These are all subjects which a lover of an- 
tiques, in pursuit of his own particular hobby, is sure 
to become interested in, or at least to want a little 
information about. Mrs. Moore writes definitely and 
concisely, and her wide acquaintance among English 
and American collectors enables her to offer her 
readers a particularly complete and helpful set of 
illustrations. 

A curious little book, fraught with 
S^aS"'^"^'* interest both as a historical study 

and a human document, is the collec- 
tion of the " Love-Letters of Henry VIII. to Anne 
Boleyn," now issued by Messrs. John W. Luce & 
Co. in a small leather-bound volume, with fanciful 
frontispiece and incidental decorations in black and 
white. A note by Mr. Halliwell Phillips, reprinted 
from another edition of the letters, gives an account 
of the earliest appearance of the letters in print, and 
a justification for the accepted order of arrangement. 
The order in the present edition, which is explained 
in a second note of anonymous authorship, is radi- 
cally different, following that of Mr. Brewer's Cal- 
endar of State Papers. Each letter is dated as 
exactly as the evidence warrants, and there are a 
•few textual notes. A perusal of the letters shows 
Henry in the character of a fairly ardent though not 
passionate lover, with a strong tendency to moralize 
and to lay emphasis upon the practical rather than 
the sentimental aspects of his affection. There is 
nothing here to kindle Anne's cold heart, but much 
to assure her of her royal lover's devotion, and of his 
pious dependence upon divine Providence to bring 
their affairs to a happy issue. These emotions seem 
a little forced in view of the facts, and the colorless 
phrasing is due, possibly, to the fact that more than 
half of the letters were written in French. Besides, 
Henry lived before the dawn of the art of letter- 
writing. He evidently regards correspondence as a 
mere necessary means of communication, and does 
not dream of being personal or expansive in a letter. 
His scholarship shows only in a polished style and in 
chance bits of Latin ; while of the wit and versatility 
that made Erasmus wonder, there is no sign. So 
there is nothing in these rather commonplace epistles 
to cause the most sensitive reader to raise a cry of 
confidence violated. And yet, as a work of a moral 
monster and a great king, the collection is not with- 
out a unique interest for modern readers, though 
most of that interest must be read between the lines.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



To journey through Denmark, Nor- 
iSn«;r '^ ^^y' ^«d Sweden, to cross the Baltic 

Sea and the Gulf of Finland, getting 
a glimpse of Helsingf ors, to ^o to St. Petersbiirg and 
Moscow, and then to scamper back to London, the 
starting-point, by way of Berlin, Hamburg, Amster- 
dam, and Den Haag, all in five weeks, is to invite some 
musty comparisons with the personally conducted 
tourist who helter-skelters round Europe in a limited 
vacation time. Mr. William Seymour Edwards took 
his honeymoon trip over the route outlined, and de- 
spite the shortness of the time given to it he appears 
to have seen much more and to have assimilated it 
better than the average tourist does. His book en- 
titled "Through Scandinavia to Moscow" (Robert 
Clarke Co. ) , while commonplace in many respects, 
is saved from mediocrity by the author's remarks on 
the people he observed — especially in Scandinavia. 
In Norway he was struck with the sight of many 
newly-built farm-houses and their substantial and 
modern improvements, all made with the aid of 
American dollars sent home by prosperous Nor- 
wegians living in our Northwest. An interesting 
contrast between the Norwegian and the Swede is 
pointed out. " The Norwegian looks out upon the 
Twentieth Century and finds his inspiration in the 
example of free America and the universal equality 
of man. The Swede looks ever backward to the 
glorious days of Gustavus Vasa, Gustavus Adolphus, 
and Charles XII., and sighs for a return of the good 
old times when the half of Europe trembled before 
Sweden's military might. . . . Thus have the cousin 
peoples swung wide apart. The one, free and open- 
minded ; the other, still dazed by the faded glories 
of a long dead past, turns ever a wistful eye toward 
the military tyrannies of Czar and Kaiser, and finds 
in the inequalities of landed noble and landless yokel, 
in official military caste and enthralled peasantry, 
the realization of his Fifteenth Century ideal." Mr. 
Edwards's comments on the relations of the Slav and 
the Jews, and their much advertised conflicts, are very 
sensible, much more so, indeed, than many accounts 
which purport to treat the matter at great length with 
more extended data. The Jew in Russia, according 
to Mr. Edwards, " prospers without and in spite of 
the fostering care of the autocracy," and hence he 
incurs the Slav's envy and jealousy. Like a loyal 
American, Mr. Edwards closes his book with thank- 
fulness that he and his bride were '' born and bred 
beneath the Stars and Stripes." 

Th letters of a " ^^^ Thomas LawTcnce's Letter-bag" 
famous artist (Longmans), edited by Mr. George 
a7id gallant. Somes Layard, and supplemented by 
some pleasant recollections of the artist by a con- 
temporary. Miss Elizabeth Croft, is offered as a sort 
of corrective to " An Artist's Love Story " which 
Mr. Oswald G. Knapp edited two years ago from 
certain of Lawrence's letters, and those of Mrs. 
Siddons and her daughters, that had to do with the 
painter's coquettish attentions to the two Misses 
Siddons. This earlier work has already been noticed 



in these columns. Now, out of " five immense vol- 
umes " of unpublished letters to and from the artist 
his present editor and apologist has selected a goodly 
number of very correct and proper epistles wherein 
affairs of the heart are seldom mentioned, to show 
us the man in a more favorable light. That Law- 
rence was now and then vexatiously dilatory in filling 
orders for his pictures, is made plain ; but no worse 
charge can be brought against him from this pub- 
lished correspondence. Of Mr. Layard's book it 
may truly be said that the end crowns the work : the 
concluding " Recollections " of the painter's friend 
Elizabeth Croft, who survived him by twenty-six 
years, give a more intimate and attractive picture of 
him than do his own letters. Twenty-two illustra- 
tions, mostly from Lawrence's paintings, enliven the 
volume and convey a good idea of the artist's peculiar 
excellence — that of an incomparable draughtsman 
of faces and hands. These prints are all the better 
for leaving out, by necessity, the painter's defects of 
coloring, which has been censured as hard and 
glassy, though brilliant and effective. Campbell 
used to say of his work : " This is the merit of Law- 
rence's paintings — he makes one seem to have got 
into a drawing-room in the mansions of the blest, 
and to be looking at oneself in the mirrors "; and 
Opie, less kindly : " Lawrence made coxcombs of his 
sitters, and his sitters made a coxcomb of him." Of 
the " dangerous fascination " of the old flirt, Fanny 
Kemble long ago told us her experience. 

Planning the ^^^ modest volume by Loring Un- 
garden and its derwood, entitled " The Garden and 
accessories. j^g Accessories" (Little, Brown & 

Co.), is not so much out of season as it might ap- 
pear, for it is the often reiterated advice of expert 
gardeners to plan the garden well in advance in 
order to have it a success. If this is the case with 
the trees, shrubs, and flowers, certainly it is even 
more important where the permanent settings of the 
garden are concerned ; since on those, as not only 
landscape gardeners but home-builders are beginning 
to see, the final beauty of the picture and its satis- 
fying qualities are most apt to depend. The book 
contains only about a hundred pages of text, but 
there is an illustration, and an excellent and really 
illustrative one, for nearly every page of reading 
matter. The author, who is a landscape architect, 
writes with knowledge and love of his subject, and 
emphasizes a point too often lost sight of — the 
necessity of proportion, harmony, suitability, if the 
result is to be beauty. The descriptions and pictures 
of the different types of garden-houses, pergolas, 
trellises, and arches, the garden gazing-globes, sun- 
dials, stone lanterns, seats, tables, bird-houses, and 
what-not, the lily-ponds, the walls, terraces, and 
fences, will be studied with interest by those who 
are planning a garden, whether large or small, for- 
mal or informal. Likewise the chapter on suitable 
materials for these accessories may be read with 
profit. But the most important advice is given in 
the beginning, — on the wisdom of providing our

gardens with such permanent settings as shall make 
them attractive all the year round, and of not copy-

and an individuality of their own. 



It is not every reader that can sym- 
^ZTa:Z''"V^thize with Charles Lamb in his 

avowed preference for books about 
books ; and even of those that can, comparatively 
few will be familiar enough with the ancient classics 
to turn with intelligent interest the leaves of Mr. 
Hugh E. P. Piatt's ciirious little volume entitled "A 
Last Ramble in the Classics " (Oxford : B. H. Black- 
well). This is not merely a book about books, but 
it is even to some extent a book about books that 
are themselves about books — bookishness raised to 
the third power, so to speak. Among all sorts of 
matters pleasantly treated, with apt quotations from 
authors classical and post-classical, we meet with 
sections devoted to " Sport in the Poets," " Melo- 
dious Verse," " False Quantities," '' Some Quaint 
Mistakes," "More Proverbial Phrases" (in addi- 
tion, that is, to similar phrases in the same author's 
" Byways in the Classics ") , " Words and Manners," 
" Sundry Questions," etc. The following legal wit- 
ticism, classic in flavor, is one of the many quotable 
things in the book. " Once, when plaster came 
tumbling down as he was hearing a case, Mr. Justice 
Chitty ejaculated, ' Fiat justitia, ruat ceiling ! ' " 
Lacking Mr. Piatt's professed fondness for verify- 
ing references, and also the time necessary to verify 
his very numerous references — which might claim 
more hours of work than he spent in writing the 
book — we must assume, as we gladly do, that his 
careful scholarship has kept him from error in his 
multitudinous citations. His zeal and industry in 
this his chosen field of labor (or relaxation) are 
admirable, although to most readers his little book 
may well appear to bear somewhat the same relation 
to live literature of real life as it is to-day that 
cherry-stone carving does to sculpture. But it is 
not given to everyone to carve cherry-stones with 
distinction. 

The remarkable deeds of six remark- 
able men, told by a writer also ac- 
counted remarkable, furnish reading 
that should be and is remarkably interesting. " Real 
Soldiers of Fortime " (Scribner), from the same pen 
that has already depicted the imaginary " Soldiers 
of Fortune," presents in brief compass the striking 
adventures of Major-General Henry Ronald Douglas 
Maclver, Baron James Harden-Hickey, Mr. Winston 
Spencer Churchill, Captain Philo Norton McGiffin, 
General William Walker, and Major Frederick Rus- 
sell Burnham " the king of scouts." Not in every 
instance does Mr, Richard Harding Davis write from 
intimate personal knowledge of his hero ; but he always 
seems so to have caught the spirit of the man he is 
describing that dulness and unreality have no place in 
his pages. The chapter on Mr. Churchill (the English 



Six noted heroes 
of adventure. 



Churchill, be it noted), soldier, war correspondent, 
lecturer, author, and politician, gains pecvdiar fresh- 
ness and actuality from the writer's near acquaint- 
ance with and admiration for his bold and talented 
young hero. But the last chapter of aU, that on Major 
Burnham, rivals it as an interest-awakener. The 
sketch of General Maclver, which opens the book, 
might perhaps have gained by the addition of fuller 
details concerning his life since 1884, when he pub- 
lished his autobiography entitled " Under Fourteen 
Flags." Brought up to date, says Mr. Davis, the 
book would properly be called " Under Eighteen 
Flags." What are the four additional flags? The 
twenty-one illustrations, especially the portraits, add 
much to the attractiveness of these true stories of 
daring deeds. 

The vital part of ^ new edition of Professor J. Mark 
psychic processes Baldwin's well-known volume with 
m Evolution. which, ten years ago, he began his 
exposition of a genetic psychology is appropriate and 
welcome. As an aid to the dissemination of interest 
in and appreciation of the vital share that psychic 
processes occupy in evolution, his books on " Mental 
Development " (Macmillan) have done good service ; 
and it is well that the opportunity has been embraced 
to incorporate such modifications and amendments 
of the text as the increasing insight of recent knowl- 
edge makes possible. The systematic appearance 
which it is attempted to give to this volume, and to 
those that followed it in the author's writings, is some- 
what misleading. They form a record of the author's 
successive change of interests in the several problems 
capable of attack from the genetic point of view ; as 
such they are suggestive, and the treatment of some 
of the problems is distinctly valuable. It is, however, 
quite impossible for one so devoted to following the 
bent of his own interests, and of giving himself great 
latitude in the prominence of favorite phases of dis- 
cussion, to achieve a fair perspective of the field as 
a whole. The announcement is accordingly timely 
that the author is engaged upon a single volume that 
will have for its central object the setting forth of 
the principles of genetic psychology. It is always 
fairer to record an appreciation of a work for what 
it really accomplishes than to render it subject to 
criticism by setting it in a class to which it does not 
belong. ^

instruments and are expected to add to the sum of

science which have been made by polar ex;peditions 
are by no means inconsiderable, but the irresistible 
desire for conquest and the spirit of adventm-e are 
powerful factors in recent expeditions as well as in 
many a past exploit in the frozen North. The last 
thirty pages of General Greely's book are devoted

and an excellent index enhance the value of this

sources of practically our entire knowledge of Arctic

story of the Panama Canal from the earliest explo- 
rations to the present time, with as much avoidance 
as possible of technics, and in a manner that shall 
be comprehensible to the general reader." Every 
feature of this vast undertaking is pictured in detail 
with simplicity and intelligibility, and without undue 
argumentative discussion. In an appendix the author 
tells the story of the " Great Canals of the World," 
a story extracted from a monograph under this title 
issued by the Department of Commerce and Labor 
at Washington. The book will serve a useful pur- 
pose as an introduction to a study of the problems 
involved in the construction of the canal, and in sum- 
marizing the things already done there. Although 
the book is written in topical style, an index would 
enhance its usefulness. Two excellent maps help 
one to understand the discussion concerning the re- 
spective merits of the sea-level and the lock systems 
of construction. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Readers of Father Sheehan's admirable novels of 
Irish life and character (to say nothing of his striking 
poems) will be glad to make his acquaintance as an 
essayist. For this the opportunity is nowoffered by the 
publication (Longmans) of a volume of his " Early Es- 
says and Lectures," wherein he discourses instructively 
and with fine intelligence upon such men as Emerson, 
Arnold, and Aubrey De Vera, and upon such themes as 
" The German Universities," " The German and Gaelic 
Muses," and " Irish Youth and High Ideals." 

Mr. Edmund G. Gardner's book on Ariosto, which he 
calls by the rather cheap title "The King of Court 
Poets " (Button), is a continuation of his " Dukes and 
Poets of Ferrara." It treats, in the first part, of the 
political conditions in Italy in the early decades of the 
sixteenth century ; and in the second, of Ariosto's works, 
the " Orlando Fm-ioso," the minor Latin poems, and the 
comedies. The poet is at times so lost sight of in the 
complex manoeuvres of Italian politics that the work 



reminds one of the famous criticism of Masson's " Mil- 
ton." Mr. Gardner, however, seeks to keep us in touch 
with his subject by illustrating, from the " Orlando " 
and other works, the poet's attitude toward the events 
of his time. The chapters dealing with the poetry of 
Ariosto are pleasing, but on the whole rather inconclu- 
sive. The style of the book is without distinction, and 
it occasionally lapses into inelegance. 

The twentieth annual volume of " Book Prices Cur" 
rent," covering the English auction season of 1905-6> 
comes to us from Mr. Elliot Stock of London. The sea- 
son here dealt with has not been a sensational one; hut 
a number of important collections, such as those of the 
late Mr. Truman and Sir Henry Irving, were disposed 
of, and the prices realized showed a very fair average. 
Full descriptive entries of over seven thousand items 
are recorded. The excellent editorial judgment and wide 
bibUographical knowledge displayed in the preparation 
of " Book Prices Current " are too well known to call 
for comment here. For the librarian and collector it is 
an invaluable reference work ; to the bookseller it is quite 
mdispensable. 

A work much needed, not by students alone, but by 
general readers as well, has been done by Professor 
Arthur G. Canfield in his selection from the '< Poems of 
Victor Hugo " (Holt). Although the book is published 
as an educational text, with the usual apparatus of in- 
troduction and notes, we hope that it will find its way 
into the hands of many people who are out of school, 
for the work of the greatest of French poets is scattered 
through so many volumes that English readers have 
scant chance of knowing it at all, unless they avail 
themselves of the sort of help Mr. Canfield offers them. 
The various volumes of the poems are taken in their 
chronological order, and from each of them a brief but 
judicious selection is made. 

From the Librairie Sansaisha, Tokyo, we have a 
" Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Geographic du Japon," a 
substantial volume of a thousand pages with three hun- 
dred cuts, the work of M. E. Papinot. The words 
" history " and " geography " are hardly adequate to 
describe the contents of this work, which is also a bio- 
graphical dictionary and a compact encyclopsedia of 
most Japanese matters. It contains articles, for ex- 
ample, upon such subjects as Bushido and Harakiri, 
to name two of those most familiar to Western rea- 
ders. An appendix of eleven " Cartes G^ographiques," 
which are excellent specimens of cartography, comes 
with the work as a separate pamphlet, not having been 
completed in time for their insertion in the bound 
volume. 

" Original Narratives of Early American History " is 
the title of a new collection of reprints, fathered by the 
American Historical Association, and published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The first volume has 
for its subject " The Northmen, Columbus, and Cabot," 
the editing of the Norse texts being the work of Pro- 
fessor Julius E. Olson, and that of the Columbus and 
Cabot texts being done by Professor Edward G. Bourne. 
The volume could not have fallen into more competent 
hands than these. The second volume gives us " Early 
English and French Voyages," largely taken from 
Hakluyt, and covering the period from Cartier's first 
journey up the St. Lawrence to the ill-fated Popham 
Colony. In between, we have the voyages of Hawkins 
and Gilbert, and the early voyages to Virginia. Dr. 
Henry S. Burrage is the editor of this volume.

Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. 

" The Horizon," " a journal of the color line," is a 
little monthly publication written and printed by negroes, 
the first number of which has recently appeared. Pro- 
fessor W. E. B. Du Bois is associated with the enter- 
prise, which has its offices in Washington, D, C. 

The series of common-sense health articles in the 
" World's Work," by Dr. Luther H. Gulick, which have 
attracted- a great deal of attention, will be embodied 
with many others in a book, entitled, " The Active Life," 
which Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. will bring out in 
February. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have concluded arrange- 
ments to publish this year a new novel by William 
de Morgan, whose " Joseph Vance " has received such 
remarkable praise from leading critics both here and 
abroad. The new book (about which no particulars have 
as yet been given out) will bear the rather striking title 
« Alice for Short." 

The Harpers have arranged for publication during 
1907 new books by President Roosevelt, William Dean 
Howells, Sir Gilbert Parker, Mark Twain, Norman 
Duncan, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Robert Hichens, 
Margaret Potter, Henry James, May Sinclair, Theodore 
Watts-Dunton, Thomas A. Janvier, Frederick Trevor 
Hill, Gertrude Atherton, Florence Morse Kingsley, and 
numerous others. 

The second volume of the "Cambridge English 
Classics " edition of Matthew Prior, to be published by 
the Messrs. Putnam this spring, will increase the known 
works of this writer by nearly a fifth. The hitherto un- 
printed prose " Dialogues," seen and praised by Pope 
but not hitherto allowed to be printed, will, by the kind 
permission of the Marquis of Bath, be included in the 
new volume, which, in addition to this, will contain a 
large number of hitherto unprinted poems by Prior. 

"Sex and Society: Studies in the Social Psychology 
of Sex," by Professor William I. Thomas, will be 
published at once by the University of Chicago Press. 
Some of the chapters comprising this work excited 
wide-spread discussion upon their first publication in 
the " American Journal of Sociology." Another book 
to be issued immediately by the same press is Mr. 
J. Dorsey Forrest's "Development of Western Civ- 
ilization," a study in ethical, economic, and political 
evolution. 



Two biographical works of unusual interest an- 
nounced for early publication by the Macmillan Co. 
are "The Life and Letters of Edwin Lawrence Godkin," 
by Mr. Rollo Ogden, editor of the " New York Evening 
Post " ; and a volume on Emerson, by Professor George 
E. Woodberry, in the " English Men of Letters " series. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. will celebrate the 
centenary of Longfellow's birth on February 27 by 
publishing a volume entitled " Henry Wadsworth Long- 
fellow: A Sketch of His Life," by Professor Charles 
Eliot Norton. The autobiographical matter included in 
the poet's notes written for the later editions of his 
poems, his correspondence, and his journals, will be laid 
under contribution for this book. 

The March announcements of Messrs. T. Y, Crowell 
& Co. include the following: "The Ministry of David 
Baldwin," a novel dealing with the conflict between old 
school theologians and modern critics, by Mr. Henry T. 
Colestock; "Orthodox Socialism," by Professor James 
Edward Le Rossignol, of the University of Denver; 
" Christ's Secret of Happiness," by Dr. Lyman Abbott; 
"The Greatest Fact in Modern History," by Hon. 
Whitelaw Reid; " The Religious Value of the Old Tes- 
tament," by Professor Ambrose White Vernon, of Dart- 
mouth College. 

The following well-known authors will contribute 
new books to the spring list of Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. : Kate Douglas Wiggin, author of " Re- 
becca of Sunnybrook Farm"; Norah Davis, author of 
" The Northerner"; Ellen Olney Kirk, author of " Our 
Lady Vanity"; Mrs. M. E. M. Davis, author of "The 
Little Chevalier"; Andy Adams, author of "The Log 
of a Cowboy"; Edward Waldo Emerson, editor of the 
"Centenary" edition of Ralph Waldo Emerson's works; 
and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, author of " Part of 
a Man's Life." 

A uniform handy-volume edition of the great writers 
of fiction, issued at a low price, has long been a desid- 
eratum. Such a series is now announced by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co., who will publish early next fall 
the first ten volumes of a doUar-a-volume series of re- 
prints from Dickens, Thackeray, Scott, George Eliot, 
and others, printed from new plates and issued under 
the general name of " The Prairie Classics." The vol- 
umes are to be the handy size of 4i x 7| inches; the 
type used is the excellent " Scotch face " made by the 
MUler & Richard foundry at Edinburgh; and the paper 
is the famous English " Bible " paper. Each volume 
will have a frontispiece in colors from the brush of Mr. 
George Alfred Williams. These first ten titles will be 
followed during 1908 by another group, and the plan 
contemplates eventually completing each group.

The Magazine Reader's Friend 



TN each monthly issue of What's in the 
Magazines the contents, for the same 
month, of nearly one hundred leading peri- 
odicals are classified, indexed, described, and 
commented upon, — all in the simplest and 
most convenient way imaginable. It makes 
accessible to the busy every-day reader the 
entire mass of current periodical literature 
as it appears. Each issue presents a bird's- 
eye view of the magazines of the month, that 
will give one in five minutes the information 
hitherto to be obtained only by long and 
tedious examination of contents-pages on the 
news-stands. It is a periodical that brings 
the other periodicals into a nutshell; and so 
must prove indispensable to everyone who 
would keep in touch with current affairs.

A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity. The 
multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment 
to those who try to keep in touch with cui^ent literature, and despair was heretofore the portion of 
the man who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced. As a handy guide to the things 
one needs or desires, What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest. 

— Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

The value of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will 
be rapidly appreciated by the student, the teacher, the specialist in any field of research, the general 
reader and the man of affairs. It is a publication that will admirably supplement ''Poole's Index " 
and the ''Guide to Periodical Literature." — Detroit Evening News. 

So great is the reliance placed upon What 's in the Magazines that the busy man and woman 
wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and 
places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader. It is not. however, a 
mere list of contents, nor a complicated index, but each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the muga^ 
zine contents of the month. Its valus to busy men and women is incalculable.

SEX AND SOCIETY 

Studies in the Social Psychology of Sex 

By WILLIAM I. THOMAS, Associate Professor of Sociology 
in the University of Chicago. 

THIS volume approaches the question of woman and her position in society from a 
new standpoint. It recognizes that sex is a fundamental factor in the origin and 
development of social institutions and occupational activities, and that a number of 
social forms and forces are of sexual origin. 

After a preliminary paper in which the organic differences of the two sexes are 
analyzed, there follows a series of studies on the relation of sex to social feeling and 
•stimulation, and the influence of sex in securing a system of social control ; the 
psychology of the maternal system of tribal organization; sex as a factor in the 
differentiation of occupations in early society, and the relation of woman to early 
industry and invention ; the relation of sex to the origin of morality ; the origin of 
exogamy; the origin and psychology of modesty and clothing. 

In the last two papers, on "The Adventitious Character of Woman" and "The 
Mind of Woman and the Lower Races," modern woman is interpreted from the stand- 
point of certain conventions and prejudices which emanate from the fact of sex, and 
which have excluded her from full participation in the activities of the " white man's 
world," with the result that she develops a type of mind and character not represen- 
tative of the natural traits of her sex. 

Former treatises on the " woman question " have dealt in the main in a descriptive 
way with the history of marriage, or at least only with the details of the development 
of the marriage system, and have failed to present a theory which makes clear the 
significance of the present position of woman in society. The volume of Professor 
Thomas is the first attempt made to estimate the influence of the fact of sex on the 
origin and development of human society.

CHEMISTRY AND CRITICISM. 

The classification of human beings as bro- 
mides and sulphites, a product of the whimsical 
invention of Mr. Gelett Burgess, is explained 
in considerable detail in his suggestive little 
book, " Are You a Bromide ?" For those not 
yet acquainted with this contribution to anthro- 
pology (or psychology), a few words of explana- 
tion may be offered. Bromides, who are the 
majority of mankind, " all think and talk alike," 
their " minds keep regidar office hours," and 
they " may be depended upon to be trite, banal, 
and arbitrary." They are known by their use 
of such " bromidioms" as these : " I don't know 
much about Art, but I know what I like." " I 
want to see my own country before I go abroad." 
" It isn't so much the heat (or the cold) as the 
humidity in the air." Sulphites, on the other 
hand, " are agreed upon most of the basic facts 
of life, and this common luiderstanding makes 
it possible for them to eliminate the obvious 
from their conversation." A sulphite is a per- 
son who does his own thinking ; he is a person 
who has surprises up his sleeve. He is ex- 
plosive. One can never foresee what he will 
do, except that it will be a direct and spontan- 
eous manifestation of his own personality." 
Hamlet, Becky Sharp, and Mr. G. Bernard 
Shaw are typical sulphites ; examples of equally 
typical bromides may be foimd in Polonius, 
Amelia Sedley, and Miss Marie Corelli. 

Since reading the author's instructive expo- 
sition of this new method of classification, our 
thought has been taking a chemical cast, and 
we have found a certain satisfaction in dwelling 
upon other symbolisms of the same general na- 
ture, having in view books rather than persons, 
— a distinction without much difference, how- 
ever, since (to use a common bromidiom) a 
man's writing is sure to be the reflection of his 
personality. There is the old fancy of the four 
elements, for example, now superseded by the 
fourscore of which we have exact knowledge, 
with occasional additions to the list. Is not a 
parallel offered by the structural simplicity of 
the older literatiu-e as compared with the com- 
plexity of the modern product? May we not 
suggest that the old books — the primitive sagas 
and epics and myths — are compounded of four

elements ? It does not seem to be forcing the 
analogy overmuch to discover the element of 
earth in the hunger-motive, that of air in the 
love-motive, that of fire in the fighting-motive, 
and that of water in the nature-motive. These 
fundamental motives, as embodied in literature, 
have been ricHly illustrated in Mr. Charles 
Leonard Moore's recent contributions to our 
pages. On the other hand, modern books are 
inadequately described in such simple terms. 
They exhibit the fundamental elements, but 
also many others, and the variety of their com- 
pounds would be bewildering were we not sup- 
plied with a critical chemistry for their proper 
ordering. Take the element of love alone : it is 
a comparatively simple matter in Homer and 
the Niebelungenlied and the balladry of the 
middle ages, but in the modem novel its forms 
are innumerable. Here is the opportunity for 
our suggested chemical method of criticism, 
which trimnphantly responds to the exigency. 
For in the new chemistry of the carbon-com- 
pounds we have an exact parallel to the new 
amorism of our ingenious modern novelists and 
poets. 

Once started upon this flight of chemical 
analogy, fancy finds abundant material for exer- 
cise. Collaborative books, for example, usually 
illustrate the fundamental fact of chemical com- 
bination, the fact that the elements in such a 
union lose their distinctive properties, the pro- 
duct being like neither of its constituents. 
Again, many a writer exhibits the phenomenon 
of aUotropism, having under different conditions 
modes of expression so diverse as hardly to 
suggest the same personality. Isomerism is fre- 
quently exemplified in literature. We may find 
two books compoimded apparently of the same 
elements in the same proportions ; yet one of 
them may be an inspired creation of genius, and 
the other but the dullest of fabrications. The 
old theory of phlogiston affords another parallel 
of highly suggestive character. According to 
that ingenious doctrine, combustion (which 
modern chemistry knows to be oxidation) meant 
the loss of phlogiston — an element having 
negative gravity — whereby the resultant sub- 
stance was made heavier than the unconsumed 
original. How many a writer, by a similar loss, 
has grown ponderous and inert ! Wordsworth 
was evidently dephlogisticated when he wrote 
the " Ecclesiastical Sonnets," and most sequels 
to works of genius show that the volatile 
element has escaped. 

The synthesis of organic compounds, which 
so definitely separates the new chemistry from 



the old, has its literary analogies. The work of 
literature, which was once supposed to be a 
work of creation, springing from the personality 
of its maker, now tends more and more to be- 
come the product formulated by rule and shaped 
from materials collected for the purpose. The 
old injimction of poet to poet, "Look in thy 
heart, and write," has given place to the modern 
counsel (not of perfection), " Look in thy scrap- 
book, and piece together." Thus are produced 
the countless imitations of old patterns that 
now clamor for our attention, imitations having 
a nicety of adjustment calculated to deceive all 
but the elect few. No " vital principle " is 
longer needed for the production of song or 
ballad ; the literary laboratory has become inde- 
pendent of that old-fashioned agency, reproduc- 
ing all the old typical forms in flask or alembic, 
and supplementing them with countless varia- 
tions of its own devising. 

Just as scientific chemistry has taken the 
place of romantic alchemy, so has the craftsman 
method of literary production taken the place 
of the old free play of creative imagination. 
And the cherished impossibilities which were 
the ideals of the alchemist — if we may be per- 
mitted a still greater confusion of metaphor 
than has hitherto been indulged in — are now 
realized in literature. Is not the modern maga- 
zine the exact analogue of that universal solvent 
which the alchemist sought in vain, and is not 
the modern novel the very type of his philoso- 
pher's stone that should transmute the baser 
forms of matter into gold ? If his ideal of the 
elixir of life still eludes our modern poets, there 
are at least many of them who are fully con- 
vinced of having made that discovery also ; and 
this cheerful delusion is a very fair substitute 
for the reality. 

As a conclusion to this series of f ancif id diva- 
gations, we wish to bring forward, by way of 
supplement to the Bourgeois philosophy of 
bromides and sulphites, a classification of our

set it essentially apart from the other, for it is 
by expression that the bromide and the sulphite

chemists a classification of substances into crys- 
talloids and colloids, and the method of strain- 
ing through a membrane whereby they may be 
distinguished and separated is called dialysis, 
which fact seems to justify us in claiming a cer- 
tain proprietorship in the critical analogue of 
this physical process. Only the briefest of 
characterizations is here possible. Crystalloid

writing has a distinctive form which it usually 
assumes if free to make the proper molecular 
adjustments, and which it always tends to as- 
sume. It has angles and facets, is subject to 
laws of internal strain, and offers marked re- 
sistance to external forces. Colloid writing, 
on the other hand, is essentially amorphous and 
gluey ; its molecules seem to recognize no laws 
of symmetry, and are ready to shape themselves 
in accordance with whatever pressure, internal 
or external, may be exerted upon them. To 
name a few contrasted pairs of writers is the 
best way to illustrate our meaning. Tennyson 
and Browning, Tourguenieff and Tolstoy, 
Brunetiere and Lemaitre, Schopenhauer and 
Schelling, may be suggested as such pairs. 
Himdreds of others will occur to the reader 
upon a little reflection. Since the function of 
this journal, as we take it, is dialytical in the 
sense here indicated, we have allowed ourselves 
the above exposition ("Marry, how? Tropi- 
cally") of an original principle of applied 
chemistry as related to literary criticism. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The commercialization of literature is 
again forcibly treated by Mr. Henry Holt, the vet- 
eran publisher, whose paper in the current " Put- 
nam's " is a sort of supplement to his earlier 
utterance on the subject which was published in the 
"Atlantic" of November, 1905, exciting much 
comment and discussion. His latest word is in the 
nature of a reiteration, with courteous replies to 
hostile critics. Many slurs upon publishers are 
rightly resented by him as a self-respecting member 
of the guild, while he also undertakes to plead the 
cause of self-respecting authors and to show that 
the literary agent is a personage that can commonly 
be dispensed with. The distinction between matter 
that can place itself and matter that needs placing 
goes to the bottom of the whole question : matter of 
the first kind needs no agent ; that of the second no 
agent has any use for. But Mr. Holt admits that 
the agent can sometimes be of service in selling 
serial and dramatic rights, and the rights to publish 
in foreign countries or in the colonies. With these 
exceptions any business between author and pub- 
lisher that the author prefers not to attend to in 
person can better be placed in an honest lawyer's 
hands than in a literary agent's. The " some of the 
time " that all the people can be fooled by the lit- 
erary agent has passed, says Mr. Holt; and the 
"some of the people" that can be fooled all the 
time are too few to fxu-nish the agent lucrative 
employment. Answering the objection that Mr. 
Holt's publisher is an ideal creation, non-existent in 
the flesh, he says : " I have suggested no ideal that 



I have not known in actual practice, and although 
the publishing business in America is in a lower 
estate than it has been before since I knew it, I 
have had, and have, the privilege of knowing sev- 
eral men in it who live up to the best that I have 
claimed, and find their account in it despite the com- 
petition of methods that they scorn." If all pub- 
lishers and all authors lived up to Mr. Holt's high 
ideals of commercial honor, what a happy life the 
literary life would be !

The decay of academic courage is the subject 
of some plain words by a college professor, in a 
recent number of the " Educational Review." The 
sting of the text lies not in the implication that the 
professor is losing his valor, but that the conditions 
of control in the higher education are so autocratic 
and intolerant that it requires an uncommon amount 
of courage to stand up and point out the dangers 
and injustice of the status quo. The editor of the 
" Review " rejects these conclusions, and declares 
that " It must be an unquestioned fact to any but 
the totally and wilfully blind that the academic 
career was never so dignified, so respected, so hon- 
ored, so courageous, so independent, so free, as at 
the very moment of writing these words. Any 
statement to the contrary is absolutely unjustified, 
unwarranted by the facts, contrary to the facts." 
Notwithstanding the sweeping and vehement char- 
acter of this rejoinder, we can hardly regard the 
discussion as thereby closed. There are various 
ways of conducting the complex affairs of state, and 
in any fair consideration of the dignity and comfort 
of the college professor's position this useful if 
modest functionary has a right to say how the thing 
looks to him. The enormous progress of our uni- 
versities and colleges appeals to the popular admi- 
ration of success, and there is little danger of a lack 
of appreciation of the man with his hand on the 
throttle — the man who makes things go. But there 
are some burning questions (particularly as to the 
woeful poverty of teachers' and professors' incomes) 
that must soon occupy, in a very practical temper, 
a prominent place in the discussions of academic 
welfare. . , . 

An endowed journal of literary criticism 
has appeared, and in a quarter where we should 
perhaps least look for it — the Republic of Mexico. 
It is the Revista Critica, and makes the interesting 
announcement that the government of Vera Cruz 
has extended to it a generous financial support. It 
is thus probably the first periodical of its kind in our 
hemisphere to receive State aid. It is also the official 
organ of the Associacion Literaria Internacional 
Americano, a society which has for its purpose the 
fostering of literature in all the Spanish American 
countries. The headquarters of this Association are 
at Havana. In Havana, too, there is just launched 
a new magazine, " America," in whose pages the 
poets and romance writers of the league will try to 
gain a public. There seems to be a genuine awak-

ening of literary interest and literary talent in the 
great Southlands. There is a stirring of many 
wings and a chorus of voices. But indeed, to one 
who knows anything of these beautiful regions, who 
remembers their picturesque history, it is a matter 
of wonder that they have not sooner challenged 
and caught the world's attention by great works. 
These peoples inherit the Latin art instinct, and in 
the Spanish language have one of the most beautiful 
and harmonious instruments of expression mankind 
has yet invented. And their special qualities of 
bravery, courtesy, and hospitality, which rise to 
romantic heights, are a guarantee that there will be 
no failure of literary material or makers. It is time 
that our North American indifference to the intel- 
lectual life of our nearest neighbors should cease. 
" 'Tis ignorance which makes a barren waste 
Of all beyond ourselves." 

Perhaps the real Athens or Florence or Weimar 
of our Occidental world may some day find itself 
located on the borders of the Gulf of Mexico, in an

the Andes. ... 

A TEAR OF MAGAZINE POETRY is the Subject of 

an interesting study contributed by Mr. William 
Stanley Braithwaite to the Boston " Transcript." 
Six leading American monthlies, the same half 
dozen that furnished material for a similar article 
last year, have again been overhauled, their poems 
counted and graded and classified, and some gen- 
eral deductions drawn. The writer declares that 
" students and lovers of poetry know conclusively 
there is written to-day infinitely better verse than 
nine-tenths of what gets printed in magazines. And 
they know that these pieces are being constantly 
rejected by editors." This exclusion of good poetry 
is supposed to be due to an editorial regard for what 
the public presumably demands, and also to space 
requirements in the make-up of a magazine page 
according to traditional rules. In matters of more 
detail, let us quote : " The space devoted to verse by 
these periodicals against that of prose in 1906 varies 
little from that of 1905. The average is about 9700 
pages of prose to 220 of verse. The poems in the 
six magazines numbered 340, the total being appor- 
tioned as follows : Lippincott's 88 pieces. Harper's 
78, Century 61, Scribner's 51, Atlantic Monthly 
35, McClure's 27. Lippincott's, publishing the 
largest number, presented the lowest order of ability 
or merit ; 8 out of the 88 come within the standard 
of acceptance by intrinsic merit, though only 3 pos- 
sess any distinction to appeal impressively through 
some single quality. Harper's is second by num- 
bers, printing 78, 11 attaining the merit class from 
which 4 elevate themselves through essentially 
poetic achievement. The Century stands third with 
61, 10 of which above the merit average include 8 
of decided poetic distinction. Scribner's follows in 
fourth place with 51, 7 of which are worthy of 
classification, with 4 distinctively excellent. The 
Atlantic Monthly contained 35, 9 having merit, of 



which 5 possess distinction." These poems of " dis- 
tinction " are then named, their authorship -given, 
and the magazines in which they appeared desig- 
nated. Of course the element of personal bias is 
not to be overlooked in all this ; but Mr. Braith- 
waite has already done good work for the cause of 
poetry — witness his recent excellent compilation of 
" Elizabethan Verse " — and his authority as a 
critic is not contemptible.

The sneeze in literature, and more especially 
in folk-lore, might be made the subject of a curi- 
ously interesting and probably voluminous treatise. 
To begin with, the Arabs tell us that the universe 
itself is the happy result of a sneeze by AUah, which 
at once delivers us from a tangle of philosophical 
and metaphysical argument and disputation. A 
Norwegian scholar has lately made some researches 
in the customs and superstitions that have to do 
with sneezing, and a few of his discoveries are worth 
noting. In China, where etiquette rules supreme, 
whenever the premonitions of a sneeze make them- 
selves manifest all present fold their hands in prayer 
and bow to the earth until the explosion is over; 
then they all voice their pious hope that the bones 
of the sneezer's illustrious ancestors have not been 
disturbed by the earth-spirit. Contrariwise, the 
Japanese consider it not good form to take any 
notice of a sneeze unless its author chance to belong 
to the Fox Clan, in which case sacrifices are offered 
to the Fox God. This is not unlike our own polite 
practice of repressing or muffling the sneeze if 
possible, and of taking little notice of it if it escapes 
control. Some European nations, as the Germans, 
have a formula to avert the ill omen of a sneeze, 
or to make sure that it be of happy omen to the 
sneezer. ''■Prosit!" greets the ears of the aston- 
ished Anglo-Saxon upon his first sneeze in Teutonic 
territory. Some peoples use a phrase equivalent 
to " God help you ! " or " God bless you ! " — ^the 
latter form dating from Saint Gregory's time. It 
was while he was pope that an epidemic (probably 
the influenza, or, as we should say now, the grippe) 
broke out in Italy and set aU the people to sneez- 
ing. This attack was called " the death-sneeze," 
and Pope Gregory issued an edict that all who sur- 
vived this paroxysm of sneezing should exclaim, 
"God bless my soul!" All of this, and much else 
more marvellous, may be read in the book of the 
sneezer out of Norway.

Fiction-reading as a " rest cure " is not likely 
soon to go out of vogue. Indeed it may be said to 
have a great future before it. The hurried and 
worried, the nervous and distracted, the business 
and professional men who see much of the seamy 
side of life, all demand, and will continue to de- 
mand, in the leisure hour of dressing-gown and slip- 
pers, a bright and brisk and optimistic picture of 
things as they should be but are not, in the form 
of fiction. In addition to these classes of novel-

readers is the large number of ladies (and gentlemen 
too) of elegant leisure who make a serious business 
of novel-reading, visiting the circulating library pei'- 
haps every day but Sunday to exchange the next- 
to-the-last for the very latest new novel. A bright 
young lady, entering a London library and asking 
for the very latest new novel, was requested to be 
more specific, as eight new novels had come in that 
morning, " Oh," she replied, " then I '11 have the 
one that came in last." Ste. Beuve used to deplore 
the increasing vogue of the novel, as a form of lit- 
erature destined to swallow up all other varieties ; 
and already it has encroached on the domain of 
history, of sociology, of psychology, of religion, of 
finance (witness Mr. Lawson's forthcoming "Friday 
the Thirteenth"), and even of natural science. 
Those who watch the signs of the times in the lit- 
erary world predict an increasing demand for books 
in the coming years ; and of these books the greater 
number must, while human nature continues to be 
human nature, be books that amuse rather than 
instruct. The outlook for the novel is therefore a 
bright one. In the increasing complexity and inten- 
sity and strenuosity of modern life, the novel's chief 
mission may well prove to be that of a " rest cure " 
— a name first applied to it by Mrs. Cecil Thurston.

Low-priced novels and the circulating li- 
braries seem to represent conflicting interests in 
England. Word comes from London that one large 
publishing house is now issuing works of fiction at 
half-a-crown instead of six shillings — a reduction 
of over half its former price and the price still 
asked by other publishers. With this reduction, the 
standard of manufacture being kept up, it is evident 
that only large editions will pay ; hence novels 
unlikely to command a good sale would be barred 
from publication. This low price could be afforded 
only if the novel-reading public should cease to de- 
pend so largely on the circulating library, and buy 
books direct. A general reduction of price among 
publishers of fiction would thus become a serious 
matter to the circulating libraries.

The annual report of the Library of Con- 
gress is not the least interesting reading imaginable. 
As was recently remarked of this library by a Lon- 
don literary journal, its size and importance do not 
seem to be generally realized, at least outside the 
United States. According to Librarian Putnam's 
latest figures, the library now has 1,379,244 books, 
89,869 maps and charts, 437,510 pieces of music, 
214,276 prints, besides a large number of manu- 
scripts that are not yet counted and catalogued. 
Among the many interesting additions of the year are 
Professor J. P. MacLean's collection of Shaker litera- 
ture, believed to be the largest in existence ; a mass of 
Van Buren papers, comprising about 1700 letters and 
political documents ; and some five hundred letters 
and other documents dating from 1777 to 1810, from 
the papers of Senator James Brown of Louisiana. 
The daily average attendance of readers was 2243. 



The inaccuracies of an historical novelist 
— namely, Mr. Winston Churchill — are resented 
by a newspaper of Mr. Churchill's adopted state. 
He is reported from Washington as sending back 
word to New Hampshire that he is still alive, and 
as telling the reporter in the same breath that " ever 
since New Hampshire has been a state it has been 
owned by the railroad. " To this a Concord (N. H. ) 
newspaper indignantly replies: "Mr. Churchill of 
late never loses his character as an historical novel- 
ist, and his interviews, like his novels, are curiously 
and unnecessarily inexact. New Hampshire has 
been a state since 1784. Its first railroad was 
chartered about 1840. Yet Mr. Churchill says 
the railroad has owned us ' ever since we have been 
a state.' " This is inexact enough, surely ; but some 
allowance is doubtless to be made to a young man 
so recently defeated by the railroad in his heroic 
effort to purify the politics of his state and to get 
himself elected its chief magistrate. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE LONDON TIMES AND THE PUBLISHEKS. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Having followed the " Times Book War " with keen 
interest, I naturally read your recent article " O Tem- 
pora ! O Mores ! " with much appreciation. Two state- 
ments in it, however, do not accord with the facts so far 
as I have been able to gather them. 

(1) " The book publishers made the modest request 
that ' The Times ' shoidd not resort to under-cutting dur- 
ing a period of six months from the date of a book's first 
appearance. This was flatly refused. ..." On this I have 
to remark, (a) that the request referred only to net books ; 
(b) that it was not a modest request confined to under- 
cutting the sale of new books, but an ultimatum that no 
net book, however damaged by wear or otherwise second- 
hand, should be retailed at one farthing less than its full 
price within six months of its publication ;'(c) that neither 
the modest request nor the dictatorial rule were flatly 
refused, for " The Times " claims that it has not sold 
and does not sell new net books on any other terms than 
those laid down by the publishers. In this matter I have 
every reason to believe that " The Times " is speaking the 
truth; and the PubUshers' Association has faUed to prove 
the contrary. 

(2) " ' The Times ' retorted by declaring a boycott." 
This is very nearly the opposite of the truth. So far 
from " The Times " boycotting the pubhshers, it has 
made every effort to obtain their books, and has pur- 
chased them at full retail prices rather than disappoint 
its subscribers. It has, indeed, appealed to its subscribers 
not to force it to purchase these books at such a loss; 
but I repeat, it has not boycotted the book publishers, 
either in trade, or in its reviews, or in its correspondence 
columns. 

Forgive this intrusion by a stranger; but your senti- 
ments are so admirable that I thought you might be 
glad to have your facts correct as well.

Parson axd Kj^ight.* 

A book published in 1861, called "The 
Alps," was ascribed on the title-page to " the 
Rev. Leslie Stephen." The volume on Hobbes, 
contributed to the " English Men of Letters " 
series in 1904, was declared to be the work of 
" Sir Leslie Stephen." Few of us recall the 
earlier designation, and the later one never be- 
came widely familiar, because it was the visible 
sign of an honor conferred near the close of the 
author's life. But the name " Leslie Stephen," 
unadorned by any mark of artificial distinction, 
has meant a great deal to readers of many kinds, 
from mountaineers to philosophers, for the past 
thirty or forty years ; and when the famous 
Alpinist, literary critic, biographer, historian, 
and agnostic died, not quite three years ago, 
there must have been many thousands, in both 
England and America, who felt that his death 
was a serious loss to humanity. Even the most 
favorable conditions of native aptitude and cul- 
tural environment do not often produce so rare 
a combination of scholarly equipment, keenness 
of logical perception and philosophical analysis, 
grace of persuasive style, sincerity of purpose, 
and sanity of mind. His life was an example 
of so many of the virtues that it afPords an 
imusually worthy object for our contemplation, 
and the biograplxy now published should be the 
most welcome of books to all whose interests 
are engaged in the highest ideals of thought and 
conduct. 

The task of portraying this rich and many- 
sided life has fallen into the best of hands. The 
late Frederic William Maitland, who completed 
the work last October, and whose own death we 
have since been called upon to deplore, was one 
of Stephen's most intimate friends during the 
last quarter-century of his life. He was one of 
that goodly company of " Sunday tramps " who 
for fifteen years explored under Stephen's lead- 
ership the highways and byways of England ; he 
became Stephen's kinsman by marriage ; and he 
was designated in Stephen's dying message to his 
children as the one who should prepare whatever 
" short article " or " appreciation " or " notice " 
might be called for. Almost the last words 
pencilled by Stephen upon his death-bed were 
these : " Any sort of ' life ' of me is impossible, 
if only for the want of materials. Nor should 
I like you to help anybody to say anything ex-

William Maitland. Illustrated. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



cept Maitland. He might write a short article 
or so.' That the " short article " has become 
a stout volume, telling in much detail the story 
of Stephen's life, and preserving a large amount 
of his revealing and altogether delightftd corre- 
spondence, will hardly be held chargeable as 
a fault to the biographer, although in under- 
taking so large a task he exceeded Stephen's 
modest instructions. He says : 

" I feel that in writing so much as I propose to write, 
I shall go beyond, though certainly I shall not trans- 
gress, the letter of his expressed wish; and it seems 
well for me to say why this is done. That 'short 
article or so ' about somebody else he could have writ- 
ten to perfection; but I cannot write it even imperfectly! 
The powers, natural and acquired, which enabled him 
to sum up a long life in a few pages, to analyze a char- 
acter in a few sentences, are not at my disposal, nor did 
I observe Stephen as some expert in psychology, or as 
some heaven-born novelist might have observed him. 
... I do not think that the public will be entitled 
to complain if it gets some first-hand evidence instead 
of my epitome of it, and if Stephen himself saw the 
' short article or so ' swelling to the size of a book, he 
would shake his head, it is true, but he would acquit 
me of anything worse than clumsiness and verbosity." 

One of the most interesting chapters in this 
book is that which is devoted to Stephen's first 
visit to the United States. It was undertaken 
chiefly for the purpose of studying the Civil 
War at close range, and collecting controversial 
anununition for use at home. Stephen had a 
deep-seated (and even hereditary) hatred of 
slavery and aU its works, and he was one of 
the small group of Englishmen, the group which 
included MiU and Bright, who understood the 
American situation clearly, and who knew that, 
whatever questions of theoretical politics might 
be raised to obscure the issue by Southern 
sympathizers, the practical question at stake 
was that of the " peculiar institution." In the 
summer of 1863, having stoutly championed the 
Northern cause during the first two years of the 
conflict, Stephen started for America that he 
might make observations on the spot. He knew 
little of American public men and writers, and 
" had not any notion that he was going to make 
acquaintance with American men of letters, 
still less that some of them were to be his most 
intimate friends." If it were not for his later 
correspondence with the friends whom he made 
during this visit, the volume now under review 
would have a greatly diminished interest, and 
not for Americans alone. The score of letters 
addressed to Lowell, and the fourscore to Mr. 
Charles Eliot Norton, make up a highly impor- 
tant part of Mr. Maitland's work.

of Vicksburg. He landed at Halifax, and at 
once proceeded to Boston. His first letter home 
speaks of meeting " Holmes, a rather well-known 
literary gent," and receiving cards from Field 
and Lowell. A week later he finds himself much 
at home with his new friends, and describes 
them as " really very pleasant, well educated 
men, like the best class of Cambridge men." 
Lowell " really is one of the pleasantest men I 
ever met." Holmes is " very kind and wonder- 
fully talkative, but with a good deal of sense 
and really impressing me as an extremely clever 
man." The note struck by this repeated use of 
the word " really " is a sufficient index of that 
" condescension in foreigners " about which 
Lowell wrote with such lambent satire ; and we 
make no doubt that it was many times uncon- 
sciously sounded by Stephen during these early 
New England days. It is amusing to come upon 
the ending to the letter from which we have just 
quoted. 

" I know you will think I have spoken too favourably 
of my friends over here. I am, of course, in the best 
and most English part of the country. Perhaps I shall 
find things worse as T go on." 

This apprehension became sadly justified when 
Chicago was reached a few weeks later. He says 
of the denizens of that frontier community that 
" their manners are those of bagmen and their 
customs are spitting." A few other fragments 
relating to this visit may be quoted. Newport 
was responsible for a splenetic outburst : 

" It is hatefully flat and apparently devoid even of 
good bathing. However, I could not stay in it long, for 
I felt that disgust arising which always comes to me at 
Interlaken or any of those vile haunts of all that is most 
contemptible in humanity, called watering-places." 

A few days in Washington brought him into 
contact with Seward and Lincoln. Of the latter 
we read : 

" In appearance he is much better than I expected. 
He is more like a gentleman to look at than I should 
have given him credit for from his pictures. He has a 
particularly pleasant smile, a jolly laugh, and altogether 
looks like a benevolent and hearty old gentleman." 

Seward did not make so good an impression. 

" He is a little, rather insignificant-looking man, with 
a tendency to tell rather long-winded and rather point- 
less stories, and to make those would-be profoundly 
philosophical observations about the manifest destiny 
and characteristics of the American people, of which 
Americans have got a string ready for use on all occa- 
sions, and all of which I now know by heart. He . . . 
rather provoked me, as I was telling him something of 
the friends of the North in England and mentioning 
Mill, by calling him ' Monkton Mill ' — a depth of de- 
liberate ignorance to which I should have hoped no 
decent human being on the other side of the Atlantic 
would have descended." 



Stephen found it hard work explaining to 
Americans the state of English " barbarian " 
opinion upon the subject of the war. 

" 1 rjeally don't know how to translate into civil laur 
guage what I have heard a thousand times over in 
England : that both sides are such a set of snobs and 
blackguards that we only wish they could both be 
licked, or that their armies are the scum of the earth 
and the war got up by contractors, or that the race is 
altogether degenerate and demoralized, s^nd it is pleasant 
to see such a set of bullies have a fall. I really can't 
tell them all these little compliments, which I have heard 
m private conversation word for word, and which are a 
free translation of ' Times ' and ' Saturday Review,' even 
if I introduce them with the apology (though it is a 
really genuine apology) that we know nothing at all 
about them." 

Stephen made a trip to Philadelphia and was 
oppressed by the hospitalities of his lawyer-host. 
" Whenever we meet any one he knows in the streets, 
he clutches hold of him and introduces ' the Rev. Mr. 
Stephen, the nephew of the celebrated lawyer,' or ' the 
son of the celebrated historian,' according to the sup- 
posed proclivities of the victim, and begs him to take 
me to his extensive coalyard or to his lunatic asylum or 
his world-famous book-store, or his church, or in fact to 
anything that is Ids." 

An invasion of Girard College was escaped by 
pleading benefit of clergy. 

" The founder, gaining my eternal gratitude thereby, 
but being, I fear, a shocking old scapegrace, declared 
in his will that no clergyman was ever to set foot in 
this building, and you have to give yoiir honour that you 
are not in any sense a priest before entering it. I joy- 
fully declined, and avoided presentation to the orphans." 

After making a brief visit to the seat of war in 
Virginia, Stephen returned to England, and 
poured hot shot into the " Times " by publish- 
ing a pamphlet on the American War. 

The story of Stephen's separation from the 
church in which he had taken orders was related 
in the deeply interesting reminiscences which he 
wrote several years ago, and the present biog- 
raphy supplements in various ways the personal 
confession made upon that occasion. The process 
does not seem to have been a particularly distress- 
ing one. He sloughed off the theological integu- 
ment of his early life as naturally as a crustacean 
casts off its outworn shell, and if there were any 
" growing pains " attendant upon the change, he 
kept them to himself. " In truth, I did not feel 
that the solid groimd was giving way beneath 
my feet, but rather that I was being relieved of 
a cumbrous burden. I was not discovering that 
m}^ creed was false, but that I had never really 
believed it." The separation did not take place 
with any startling dramatic accompaniment, but 
was a gradual process covering a period of several 
years. It was nearly completed at the time of 
the first visit to America. He wrote to his mother 



104

[Feb. 16, 



that subscription to the Episcopal Church in 
America " must be pleasingly lax." 

" A bishop asked a candidate for ordination the other 
day whether he believed the thirty-nine Articles. Can- 
didate said he didn't. Bishop asked whether he agreed 
with the principal articles. Candidate replied that he 
would rather not commit himself. Candidate was passed, 
the bishop saying that he had no authority to inquire 
into anything but his willingness to use the Liturgy. I 
wish bishops had as much sense in England." 

When Stephen ceased to be a parson and be- 
came a philosopher he had perhaps, all told, 
preached some twenty-five sermons. An amus- 
ing incident of the parliamentary campaign for 
the election of his friend Fawcett seems to show 
that while still a clergyman he was a human 
being. It was the day of the election. 

" The language became loud ; the ' chairman of the 
room,' one X, not a tall man, scattered his big D's 
about freely. Stephen entered, he had lost himself, and 
his language was such that it sobered X, who crept up 
to him, took his left arm in both hands, and said : ' Oh, 
Mr. Stephen, don't take on so ; the General Election will 
come in a year, when we shall want a second candidate 
to run with Fawcett, and we have made up our minds 
that you are the man we should like.' Stephen tore his 
left arm so roughly away that he nearly threw X on 
the ground, while he shouted [something about X's soul, 
and then] * Don't you know that 1 'm a parson ? ' " 

It was in 1866 that Stephen became engaged 
to Miss Thackeray, and we may quote a few 
characteristic remarks from the letter in which 
he announces the event to Mr. (now Justice) 
Oliver Wendell Holmes. 

" As for Miss Thackeray, I believe that it would be 
proper that I should give you some description of her, 
or, at least, quote poetry about her. I 'U see you damned 
first. . . . 

" Do you know what it feels like to be engaged ? 
The experience of three days or so of the state enables 
me to say that it is psychologically interesting: (1) 
Because it is incredibly pleasant — I did not think four 
days ago that I could contain so much happiness. (2) 
Because it makes an absohite breach of continuity in 
time. About December 3, in this year, the current of 
my life was parted by a chasm of inappreciable breadth. 
I should say at a guess that about ten years came in 
between two consecutive seconds, or rather, though we 
metaphysicians say that time should be represented by 
a line, this part of time seems to be fairly represented 
thus. [A diagram.] Intelligisne domine f (3) Ever since 
this dislocation, time has been going Uke a clock with 
the pendulum off, at the devil's own pace. How many 
weeks or months go to a day is beyond my arithmetic. 
I won't bother you with any more of my feelings, but 
I know that you are an admirer of H. Spencer, and 
might like a little psychological analysis." 

In a later letter to Mr. Holmes, written just 
after marriage in the following summer, we find 
these philosophical reflections : 

" To say the truth, I believe myself to have been very 
much in want of a wife, and to have been not a little 
spoiled by my donnish existence at Cambridge. It 



always tends to shrivel up a cove's faculties to live as a 
bachelor in a bachelor society with very little external 
communication. One gets rusty and stupid and morose, 
and even a comparatively family and social existence in 
London had not undonned me. I was wanting much to 
take root, and am truly thankful I have done so to my 
heart's content. In short, I am very happy indeed, and 
don't mind saying so." 

A visit to America in 1868 yields many notes 
upon places and personalities, among them this 
about a call from Mr. Emerson : 

" He is considered to be a great prophet in Yankee- 
land, though I don't much worship him. However, he 
has the merit of being a singularly mild, simple kind of 
old fellow, who does not presume in the least upon the 
reverence of his worshippers. . . . He was so kind* and 
benevolent, and talked so much like a virtuous old saint, 
that we could not help liking him." 

In connection with this note, we may quote what 
Stephen wrote a few years later about Carlyle. 
He was speaking of his brother, J. F. Stephen, 
and said : 

" Oddly enough, he has been, in my opinion, a good deal 
corrupted by old Carlyle. I never before had so much 
respect for the extraordinary vigour of that person, till 
I saw how much influence he could exercise over a man 
who is little enough disposed to sit at anybody's feet. I 
see the prophet pretty often myself, and though I am not 
so independent a character as J. F. S., I am almost equally 
repelled and attracted by him. Personally, indeed, I 
am simply attracted, for he is a really noble old cove 
and by far the best specimen of the literary gent we 
can at present produce. He has grown milder too with 
age. But politically and philosophically he talks a good 
deal of arrant and rather pestilent nonsense — • that is, 
of what I call nonsense. He is indeed a genuine poet 
and a great humorist, which makes even his nonsense 
attractive in its way ; but nonsense it is and will remain, 
and, though it is as well to have a man of genius to give 
one the corrective of the ordinary twaddle, it is a pity 
that he is not comprehensive enough to see the other side 
as well." 

Stephen's letters are so rich in so many kinds 
of intellectual and human interest (even more 
human than intellectual) that one is sure of 
"pickings" at whatever page the biography 
may chance to be opened. A few bits, taken at 
random, may give some further idea of its qual- 
ity, and fill up our remaining space. 

" As a matter of fact, Switzerland in the winter is just 
as accessible as England, and much pleasanter in some 
ways, owing to the comparative scarcity of Englishmen." 

" I must now turn to certain wretched MSS. and put 
their authors out of misery. It is not right, I fear, to 
toss up, as it would save me a great deal of trouble, and 
come to much the same thing in the end." 

" I like some particular boys ; but the genus boy seems 
to me one of nature's mistakes. Girls improve as they 
grow up ; but the boy generally deteriorates, and, in our 
infernal system, has to be sent away to school and made 
into more or less of a brute." 

" I said nothing to you of politics ; because, in truth, 
that department of the world seems to me to be given 
over for the present to the devil, in whom I entertain a

kind of provisional belief, so long as things go on in this 
perverse fashion." 

" The female student is at present an innocent ani- 
mal, who wants to improve her mind and takes orna- 
mental lectures seriously, not understanding with her 
brother students that the object of study is to get a 
good place in an examination, and that lectures are a 
vanity and a distraction." 

" Of other books, I have got on my table William 
James's new essays. They look bright, like all his 
writings. He is the one really lively philosopher; but 
I am afraid that he is trying the old dodge of twisting 
' faith ' out of moonshine." 

" You spoke of the ' X ' critic who took Poe and Walt 
Whitman for the representatives of your literature. 
That seems to me — pardon the remark — that you 
have not kept yourself posted up in the youthful British 
critic. Some time ago he took up the pair in question 
because they were both rather naughty and eccentric, 
and it seemed original to put them above their betters. 
Poe was, I think, as Lowell said, ' 3 parts of him genius 
and 1 part sheer fudge ' (perhaps ' 3 ' is too high a pro- 
portion) — at any rate, a man of genius, though he 
ruined it very soon. W. W. always seems to me Em- 
erson diluted with Tupper — twaddle with gleams of 
something better. But I quite agree with you that the 
critic was silly, or rather a young gentleman misled by 
a temporary ' fad ' — I have written so much criticism 
alas ! that I have acquired a disgust for the whole 
body of it — including my own." 

With these miscellaneous bits we send our 
readers to the storehouse from which they came 
— to the wonderfully discreet and sympathetic 
record of a lovable character and a noble life. 
" Many are alive and will say with me," remarks 
the biographer in closing, " that to have known 
Leslie Stephen is ' part of our life's unalterable 
good.' " And many others, now coming to know 
the man for the first time in the revelations of 
these pages, will give the sentiment a heartfelt

The Dual Structure of the Germai^^ 
Empire.* 



While there is no lack of learned works on 
the constitutional law of the German Empire 
by German writers — such as the commentaries 
of Laband, Zorn, Meyer, and Schulze — we 
have hitherto had no systematic treatise pub- 
lished in the English language. Dr. Burt Estes 
Howard, an American scholar who, we are told, 
has been a close student of German history and 
politics for many years, has done much to sup- 
ply this want in his excellent book on " The 
German Empire," which will probably rank 
among the standard briefer treatises of the Ger- 
mans. It is based entirely on German sources, 

* The German Empire. By Burt Estes Howard. New York : 
The Macmillan Co. 



mostly original, and afPords abundant evidence 
of wide and painstaking research. The only 
criticism worth mentioning relates to the title 
of his book, which is misleading, since the work 
relates almost entirely to a single aspect of the 
German Empire, its constitution. 

The German Empire is the only nation in 
the world to-day in which a federal system of 
government is combined with the monarchical 
principle. In this respect, and also in the con- 
stitutional inequality of the constituent members 
of which it is formed, it differs widely from the 
federal republics of the western hemisphere. 
But in other notable particulars it possesses 
striking similarities. The difficult problem of 
adjusting the relations between the central 
power and the individual units has there been 
solved in a manner very different from that oi 
any other state having a dual system of govern- 
ment under a common sovereignty. Some of its 
contributions to the solution of the problems of 
this sort of government are wholly original, and, 
we believe, in thorough accord with sound prin- 
ciples of political science. The lessons which 
they teach therefore merit the careful study of 
citizens of the great federal republic of North 
America, who must needs find solutions for some 
of the unsettled problems of our dual political 
system. 

The topics of Dr. Howard's treatise are prin- 
cipally these : The founding of the Empire ; its 
relation to the states composing it ; the Impe- 
rial Legislature ( Bundesrath and Reichstag ) ; 
the Emperor ; the Chancellor ; Citizenship in 
the Empire ; the Judicial system ; the gov- 
ernment of the Reichsland (Alsace Lorraine); 
the Imperial Fiscal system ; and the Army and 
Navy. The treatment of each of these subjects 
is lucid, accurate, and discriminating. It is 
especially in the exposition of legal and con- 
stitutional relations that Dr. Howard is at his 
best. He has a preeminently juristic bent of 
mind, as weU as a faculty for clear and concise 
statement. 

In the brief compass of this review, no at- 
tempt will be made to do more than state the 
position which the author takes on several im- 
portant matters of German constitutional law. 
Concerning the legal structure of the Empire, 
he maintains that its constituent elements are 
not citizens or subjects, but states ; and that 
sovereignty resides not in the Emperor, nor in 
the people, but in the totality of the states, i. e., 
in the Bundesrath. This is the view also of 
the abler German commentators. The Kaiser 
is not monarch q/*the Empire, but monarch in 



106 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



the Empire ; not Kaiser von Deutschland^ but 
Deutscher Kaiser. He is not an authority of 
residuary powers with the customary monarch- 
ical prerogatives, but as Kaiser he possesses only 
derivative powers. He has some of the elements 
of both a monarch and a President ; yet he is 
neither of these. His position is unique, and it 
is impossible to classify him with other rulers. 
But, owing to the importance of the military 
power in Germany, his position as Kaiser, in- 
dependently of his royal office, is one of enor- 
mous power. The office of Imperial Chancellor, 
created by Bismarck for himself, is equally 
unique, and something of a puzzle to political 
students. Dr. Howard insists that the only 
way to avoid misapprehension as to the real 
nature of the office is to distinguish between its 
dual nature — i. e., between the Chancellor's 
position as a Prussian member of the Bundes- 
raili on the one hand, and his position as the 
Emperor's only responsible minister and the 
highest imperial official on the other. Whether 
his responsibility is legal or political, as Dr. 
Howard points out, is purely an academic ques- 
tion, since there is no means of enforcing it. 
The Socialists are demanding that he should be 
made responsible to the Imperial Parliament ; 
but as yet he acknowledges responsibility to no 
one except the Emperor. 

The discussion of German citizenship is full 
and illuminating. Like all states having the 
federal system of government, Germany has had 
to deal with the difficidt problem of a dual 
citizenship — one local, the other national. Most 
commentators recognize the existence of a 
citizenship of the Empire, and also a state 
citizenship. Dr. Howard is among the num- 
ber, although he maintains that the two forms 
of citizenship are not coordinate and independ- 
ent, occupying distinct spheres, but that the re- 
lation is one of subordination and dependence. 
Contrary to the American ride, state citizen- 
ship in Germany is primary and imperial citi- 
zenship secondary ; that is, the latter is derived 
from the former, and is lost when that is lost. 
Nevertheless, it is characteristic of the German 
conception of the importance of uniformity 
among the states, that the conditions govern- 
ing the acquisition of state citizenship (and, in 
consequence, of imperial citizenship) should be 
regulated by Imperial law. This insures a 
common citizenship for all the states of the 
Empire, and does away with local divei"sities 
and inequalities. 

The German theory of centralization in leg- 
islation is also well shown in the organization of 



the judicial and legal system, which constitutes 
the subject of an important chapter in Mr. 
Howard's book. By successive statutes enacted 
since the founding of the Empire, a common 
judicial system for all the states has been pro- 
vided (except for non-contentious jurisdiction); 
and so have codes of law and procedure. Thus 
there is uniformity of law, of judicial organiza- 
tion, and judicial procedure, throughout the 
Empire ; although, with the exception of the 
Imperial Court at Leipsic, all courts are re- 
garded as state courts, the judges being ap- 
pointed and paid by the local governments. 
But here again the states are under certain 
restrictions, for they are required to provide 
the judges with adequate salaries, and the min- 
imum qualifications for eligibility to judicial 
stations are prescribed by imperial law. Dr. 
Howard does not discuss the various special 
courts (hesondere gerichte) wliich are not regu- 
lated by Imperial law, nor the administrative 
courts, nor the bar, nor the state-attorney ship. 
A real defect in his discussion of the judicial 
system is the omision of all reference to the 
questipn of the power of the courts to declare 
statutes unconstitutional. The question is not 
entirely academic, particularly when there is a 
case of conflict between the state law and the 
imperial constitution or an imperial statute. 

In his discussion of the military side of the 
Empire, the author points out the interesting 
fact that there is no imperial army, but only 
a collective imity made up of contingents of the 
several states. This would be considered a fatal 
weakness in the military organization of the 
Empire, were it not for the fact that the con- 
tingent of each state is recruited, organized, 
equipped, and drilled, in accordance with rules 
and regulations prescribed by the Empire. 
Likewise, the liability to military service, as well 
as the whole matter of discipline, rests upon 
Imperial law, and the supreme command of all 
contingents is vested in the Emperor. Another 
weak spot in the military organization of the 
Empire is the special privileges enjoyed by a 
number of the states. The smaller of these 
have ceded their special privileges to Prussia, 
so that reaUy there are but four contingents — 
namely, those of Prussia, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, 
and Saxony. The navy, imlike the army, is in 
the strictest sense an Imperial affair. When 
the Empire was formed, Prussia alone had a 
navy ; she brought it with her into the union ; 
and it has remained under the control of the 
King of Prussia, who is at the same time the 
German Emperor. J. W. Garner.

Thoreaf IX HIS Journals.* 

Seldom does it happen that the journals of 
a private citizen, a quiet man of letters, are 
published in a dozen volumes, especially in the 
United States. The Adams family, with their 
turn for both politics and literature, and their 
im wearied industry with the pen, have given us 
volume after volume of the diaries of the two 
Presidents of that fanaily ; and doubtless much 
is coming of the same sort from the copious 
papers of Charles Francis Adams, first of that 
name. But among literary Americans diary 
publication has been comparatively small. A 
century after his death, the so-called " Literary 
Diary " of President Stiles of Yale has been 
edited at New Haven, and quite recently has 
appeared the first (perhaps the only) volume 
of Dr. S. G. Howe, covering his active youthful 
years in the Greek Revolution. But Emerson's 
journals liave as yet come forth only in frag- 
ments, though they are extensive ; and the fifty 
or sixty volumes of Alcott's Diaries remain on 
the shelves at Concord, undisturbed. Theodore 
Parker's copious Journals of a quarter-century 
have been much drawn upon by his biographers, 
and are to go finally to the Boston Public 
Library, after which publication in fidl may fol- 
low, — but not, probably, until half a century 
after Parker's death at Florence, in May, 1860. 

Most of the diaries just mentioned are records 
of foreign travel, at least in part. John Quincy 
Adams had ranged over Europe from the Orient 
to Moscow ; Emerson twice or thrice visited 
Europe, and even (in 1872) went as far eastward 
as to the Sphinx of Egypt, though he made few 
notes of that final journey, taken as he was ap- 
proaching the age of seventy, and disinclined to 
write even a journal. Parker had noted, in his 
Journal of 1843-44, his interviews with famous 
scholars, and the lectures he heard in Paris and 
in Germany ; in Florence, where he is buried, 
he met the Brownings, and in Switzerland and 
Italy and the West Indies, in 1859-60, he had 
foreign incidents and manners to relate. Even 
Alcott had one brief visit to England to record, 
as veU as those many volumes which lie filled 
with what his satirical neighbor, Ellery Chan- 
ning, called his '•• Encydopedie de Moi-meme^ 
Cinquante Volumes.'''' But Thoreau's only for- 
eign travel was for ten days, from Concord to 
Canada, and its incidents were left out of his 
Journal of 1850, to appear in a work by itself, 

•The Writings of Henry David Thoreau. Walden Edi- 
tion. Edited by Bradford Torrey. In twenty volumes. Illus- 
trated. Volumes VIII.-XX., The Journals. Boston : Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 



" A Yankee in Canada," of which a quarter 
part was left unprinted. His longest journey, 
that from Concord to Redwood on the Minne- 
sota river, only found record in notes that never 
got written into his Journal of 1861, and in a 
few letters. 

What, then, is the great interest of Thoreau's 
Journals, to warrant their publication in four- 
teen well printed, illustrated, and indexed vol- 
umes, containing in the aggregate 6700 pages, 
exclusive of 70 pages of Mr.Gleason's admirable 
photogravures, six pages of his map and key, 
and 110 double-columned pages of index In 
all, the volumes faU little short of 7000 pages, 
or eight times as much as White's " Selborne " 
and Izaak Walton's " Compleat Angler," the two 
authors with whom Thoreau is perhaps most 
often compared. What is it that warrants so 
full a publication of writings which in the au- 
thor's own time were so generally overlooked or 
contemned ? Two qualities especially, — their 
wonderful variety of topic and treatment, and 
the charm of their style when at its best. Back 
of both lies Thoreau's chief quality — his power 
of exact and minute observation ; and still fur- 
ther back and deeply original with him, the 
power of profound thought and comprehensive 
imagination applied to the most commonplace 
objects and events. Hardly any writer can be 
named, ancient or modern, who devoted such 
high powers so studiously to such a cyclopaedia 
of themes. Seneca, Pliny, and Aristotle, among 
the ancients, Montaigne and Goethe of the mod- 
erns, come readily to mind, and each has some 
gifts and accomplishments that Thoreau had 
not. But, on the other hand, so had he gifts 
and industries which they had not. Perhaps 
he comes nearest to Montaigne, for, like that 
learned and irregular Gascon, he made the world 
of fact and deed revolve about himseK, instead 
of sharing its revolutions and following its fash- 
ions, like the most of us. Of course there are 
marked divergences one from the other. Where 
Montaigne is nonchalant and obscene, Thoreau 
is fastidious and fuU of exalted sentiment. 
Though their loyalty in friendship is much the 
same, Thoreau has a loftier and more unprac- 
tical ideal of his friend ; while in secular mat- 
ters he was far more widely practical than the 
landlord and magistrate in his chateau or his 
province. Emerson once, in Cincinnati, advised 
a young friend to "know Mr. C, — there is 
nothing he may not say." Of Thoreau it may 
be declared there was nothing he might not do, 
with his hands or with his head. He was a good 
boatman and boat-builder ; a mechanic and phi-

losopher ; a stoic, a cynic, a pencil-maker, and a 
poet ; good at mathematics, at merchandizing, at 
abstractions, paradoxes, and land-surveying. To 
none of his many avocations did he surrender 
himself, but stood back of and above them all 
in a proud leisure derived from the simplicity of 
his tastes and the singularity of his ambitions. 
Those foolish critics who call him indolent never 
knew him, nor any of his kind among men. His 
activity, whether physical or intellectual, was 
unceasing. Emerson, his neighbor and friend, 
had intervals of mental inefficiency, when the 
pen refused its task, and even his startling fac- 
ulty of perception seemed to slumber or be far 
away. But Thoreau was always, as the Yankee 
phrase is, " up and coming." His most intimate 
friend and best biographer, Ellery Channing, 
describing his personal traits, says : " His 
clenched hand betokened purpose. In walking 
he made a short cut if he could, and when sit- 
ting in the shade or by the wall-side he seemed 
merely the clearer to look forward into the next 
piece of activity. Even in the boat he had a 
wary, transitory air, his eyes on the outlook, — 
perhaps there might be ducks or the Blanding 
turtle, or an otter or sparrow." 

Thoreau's Journals intimate this tireless 
activity and vigilance ; and yet how many things 
and events, that he might have been expected 
to mention, are passed by in silence ! Thus, in 
the autumn of 1854, when he was making the 
acquaintance of his English admirer, Thomas 
Cholmondeley, who lived with him in the same 
house for weeks, and in December went back to 
Shropshire to enlist volimteers for the Crimean 
war, the Journal contains no allusion to his new 
friend ; and when he came over again in 1859, 
and went with Thoreau to New Bedford to call 
on his friend Ricketson, there is a very slight 
allusion to Cholmondeley in the Journal. In 
the same way, when John Brown of Kansas was 
introduced to Thoreau in 1857, dined with him, 
and made a vivid impression, so that his con- 
versation was recalled in the Journal two and 
a half years afterward, there is no mention of 
Brown in the entries of 1857. Nor is Whit- 
man much mentioned in the Journal of 1856, 
when Thoreau first met him and described him 
in a letter to Blake. His letters are often sub- 
stitutes for the Journal entries, and sometimes 
are copied from the Journal, as was Emerson's 
habit occasionally. 

Thoreau's use of his Journals, which he be- 
gan to keep regularly about 1838, was original, 
like everything about him. He used them to 
make magazine articles and books from ; and 



then he destroyed them, reserving such pages 
or fragments as he had not used, and preserving 
these scraps all his life, often using them years 
afterward in essays. In the latter case he did 
not destroy them, so that those who have bought 
his MSS. of late years may often find the scraps 
and pages among them which long since came 
out in some of his posthumous books. In the 
same way it has happened that the publishers 
of these fourteen volumes lack original pages of 
the Journal, enough perhaps to make a small 
volume ; they have been sold, and most of them 
are in the possession of Mr. W. K. Bixby of 
St. Louis, who has allowed the Bibliophile 
Society of Boston to print them in their two 
volumes called " The First and Last Journeys 
of Thoreau." Other Journal pages remain im- 
printed, but may come out hereafter in connec- 
tion with reprints of " Walden " or " A Yankee 
in Canada." There are also many verses that 
have not been brought into any collection, some 
of them in the Journals, and others in loose 
leaves, or written on the back of lecture sheets 
or pages from some destroyed journal. 

But it is time to quote from these rich and 
unusual transcripts of the meditations and ob- 
servations of a man of genius. September 19, 
1854, he writes : 

" Thinking this afternoon of the prospect of my writ- 
ing lectiu'es and going abroad to read them the next 
winter, I realized how incomparably great the advan- 
tages of obscurity and poverty which I have enjoyed so 
long (and may perhaps still enjoy). I thought with 
what more than princely, with what poetic leisure I had 
spent my years hitherto, without care or engagement, 
fancy-free. I have given myself up to Nature: I have 
lived so many springs and summers, autumns and win- 
ters as if I had nothing to do but live them, and imbibe 
whatever nutriment they had for me. I have spent a 
couple of years, for instance, with the flowers chiefly, 
having none other so binding engagement as to observe 
when they opened; I could afford to spend the whole 
Fall observing the changing tints of the foliage. Ah J 
how I have thriven on solitude and poverty ! I cannot 
overstate this advantage. I do not see how I could 
have enjoyed it, if the public had been expecting as 
much of me as there is danger now that they wUl. If 
I go abroad lecturing, how shall I ever recover the lost 
winter ? It has been my vacation, my season of growth 
and expansion, — a prolonged youth." 

This was said in consequence of the good recep- 
tion given to " Walden," then just published, 
and bringing him invitations to lecture here 
and there, even as far away as Nantucket and 
Philadelphia. But he was not a "taking" 
speaker ; his lectures were best heard by a small 
company in a parlor ; the miscellaneous audi- 
ence of a public hall went away unimpressed. 
He was presently left as uninvited as before,

except in Concord, Worcester, and Plymouth, 
where he had admiring friends. 

In contrast with the above passage, take this 
concerning one of his rather disreputable friends, 
G. M., who had skill in boating, fishing, and 
hunting, but neglected the domestic duties. 
There were several such in his list of ac- 
quaintance : 

" He follows hunting, praise be to him ! as regularly 
in our tame fields as the farmers follow farming. Per- 
sistent Genius ! how I respect it and thank him for it ! 
I trust the Lord will provide us with another G. M. 
when he is gone. How good in him to follow his own 
bent, and not continue at the Sabbath-school all his 
days ! What a wealth he thus becomes in the neighbor- 
hood ! Few know how to take the census. I thank my 
stars for M. I think of him with gratitude when I am 
going to sleep, grateful that he exists, — that M. who is 
such a trial to his mother. Yet he is agreeable to me 
as a tinge of russet on the hillside. I would fain give 
thanks morning and evening for my blessings. Awk- 
ward, gawky, loose-hung, dragging his legs after him, 
— he is my contemporary and neighbor. He is one 
tribe, I am another, and we are not at war." 

Thoreau had, however, more intimate friends 
than these, whose class Channing hit off in his 
" Near Home " — grateful he says, — 

" The while our fisher dreams, or greasy gunner 
Lank, with ebon locks, shies o'er the fences, 
And cracks down the birds, — game-law forgot ; 
And still, upon the outskirts of the town, 
A tawny tribe denudes the cranberry-bed." 

Thoreau's best and longest friends were Chan- 
ning and Emerson, — the latter the earlier, but 
not finally the more intimate, and at one time 
(in 1857) regarded with pathetic aversion, as 
having broken the abiding tie of friendship by 
his lofty manners. The passage referring to 
this was surprising when Mr. Blake printed it, 
some ten years ago ; and here it is again in 
parts, alluding unmistakably to Emerson. The 
date is February, 1857. 

" And now another friendship is ended. I do not 
know what has made my friend doubt me, — but I 
know that in love there is no mistake, and that every 
estrangement is well fomided. What a grand signifi- 
cance the word * never ' acquires ! I am perfectly sad 
at parting from you. I could better have the earth 
taken away from under my feet than the thought of 
you from my mind. ... A man cannot be said to suc- 
ceed in this life who does not satisfy one friend. ... I 
say in my thought to my neighbor who was once my 
friend, ' It is of no use to speak the truth to you; you 
will not hear it. What, then, shall I say to you ? ' . . . 
You cheat me, you keep me at a distance with your 
manners. I know of no other dishonesty, no other devil. 
Why this doubleness, these compliments ? They are the 
worst of lies. A lie is not worse between traders than a 
compliment between friends. Lying, on lower levels, is 
but a trivial offense compared with civility and compli- 
ments on the level of Friendship. . . . Friends ! they 
are united for good and for evil. They can delight each 
other as none other can. They can distress each other as 



none other can. ... I have not yet known a friendship 
to cease, 1 think. I fear I have experienced its decaying. 
Morning, noon, and night, I suffer a physical pain, an 
aching of the breast, which unfits me for my tasks. It is 
perhaps most intense at evening. That aching of the 
breast, — the grandest pain that man endures, which 
no other can assuage. ... If I should make the least 
concession, my friend would spurn me. I am obeying 
liis law as well as my own. ... At the instant that I 
seem to be saying farewell to my friend, I find myself 
unexpectedly near to him; and it is our very nearness 
and dearness to each other that gives depth and signifi- 
cance to that ' forever.' Thus I am a helpless prisoner, 
and these chains I have no skill to break. While I think 
I have broken one link, I have been forging another." 

Naturally, between men so noble, this misimder- 
standing, which had been growing for months, 
soon gave way, and the old relations were re- 
sumed. It may have been in that very call made 
by Emerson on Thoreau, the afternoon of March 
13, 1857, when he found John Brown of Kansas 
talking with Thoreau (to whom I had introduced 
him), that the ice was broken ; for we do not 
find any more of these sad entries in the Journal. 
The occasion for the coldness was, I suppose, 
the occasional roughness of Thoreau's manner, 
which was usually polite, if odd, met by a cer- 
tain formality and suavity in Emerson's manners 
that betrayed a long inheritance of etiquette 
from generations of clergymen. 

Many will read these books for the informa- 
tion they furnish on a thousand points of natural 
history ; many for their singular beauty and 
brevity of description, wherever the common- 
place was shown to have the elements of wonder 
and beauty ; many, but fewer, for their phi- 
losophic or poetic significance ; most of all, 
perhaps, for their racy humor, by which New 
England life and the rustic or mercantile Amer- 
ican character is so sympathetically portrayed.' 
But they also have the interest of an autobiog- 
raphy, and will be read for more light upon one 
of the most piquant and romantic careers among 
American scholars and reformers. For the full 
understanding of this part of the copious work, 
many more notes and explanations are needed 
than the editors had room to afford even had 
they the needful knowledge. The five and forty 
years since Thoreau's death have removed most 
of his coevals in literatiu-e and life ; and, while 
they have brought the Concord school of au- 
thors (among whom may be included, for certain 
traits, Jones Very, Walt Whitman, and John 
Burroughs) more into the foreground of our lit- 
erature, they have deprived the present genera- 
tion of the best means of judging them, whether 
as authors or men. Hence superficial and ridic- 
ulous estimates of the men and their work. The

publication of these Journals will do much to 
repair this defect, which shows itself most fre- 
quently in manuals of American literature. 

Much might be said of the good fortune of 
the publishers in securing for the sympathetic 
and pictorial illustration of the twenty volumes 
in this edition of Thoreau's writings the services 
of H. W. Gleason in photographing the scenes 
and natural incidents of his surroundings in Con- 
cord, at Monadnoc, Cape Cod, and in Canada. 
For years before this edition was decided on 
Mr. Gleason had been loyally visiting and iden- 
tifying, with the aid of his excellent camera, the 
places and conditions mentioned, and had accu- 
mulated more than two hundred fine photo- 
graphs. From these a hundred were selected 
to be engraved for this edition.

Socialistic Principles and Problems.* 



Notwithstanding the amount of attention 
given to modem socialistic movements, there is 
a lack of definite knowledge and understanding 
of the subject on the part of the general public. 
It is with a hope of remedying this condition 
that Mr. John Spargo has written his " Sum- 
mary and Interpretation of Socialistic Princi- 
ples," giving the essentials of this phase of 
modern life as it has evolved historically and 
economically. The key-note of the book is the 
so-called " materialistic conception of history." 
Mr. Spargo states that " Socialism, in the modem 
scientific sense, is a theory of social evolution." 
Having pointed out the distinction between the 
"Utopian Socialism" of Owen, Saint-Simon, 
and Fourier, and the " Scientific Socialism " of 
Marx and Engels as set forth in the " Commu- 
nist Manifesto," he concludes his work by giving 
a chapter on the Outlines of the Socialist State, 
and adds in an appendix the National Platform 
of the Socialist Party in America. Mr. Spargo, 
though tolerant of a certain amount of super- 
vision of private production and exchange, and 
at the same time less speculative as to the pre- 
cise form the state of the future will take than 
were the authors of the " Manifesto," neverthe- 
less is essentially a " Marxist," and regards as

axiomatic the " class-struggle theory." He 
shows himself conversant with current economic 
thought, and in quoting various theories he 
carefully credits them to their originators. In 
spite of the brevity of his work — the result of 
conciseness rather than of superficiality — Mr. 
Spargo gives a satisfactory general view of his 
subject, and his book is to be recommended 
especially as a foundation for a more detailed 
knowledge to be afterwards acquired. 

Of quite a different character from Mr. 
Spargo's work, yet dealing with the same gen- 
eral subject, are M. Jean Jaures's " Studies in 
Socialism." Most of the papers making up the 
volume appeared originally in a Socialist daily 
paper in Paris, from which they have been trans- 
lated into English by Miss Mildred Minturn, 
who has supplied an introduction explaining 
the significance and prospects of Socialism in 
France as well as M. Jaures's position there. 
Extremely eloquent and earnest in upholding 
the Socialist movement, M. Jaures is neither 
a " Marxist " nor a " Revolutionist," but be- 
longs rather to the school of " Reformists," or 
" Opportunists." A follower in many respects 
of Liebknecht, he denounces the scheme of rev- 
olution upheld in the " Manifesto " as both 
unnecessary and ineffectual, and holds that it 
is by " the methodical and legal organization 
of its own forces imder the law of the democracy 
and universal suffrage " that the proletariat 
will gain supreme power. " The transformation 
of all social relations cannot be the residt of a 
manoeuvre." The principle upon which he most 
insists is the universality of the Socialist con- 
ception, urging that under present conditions 
" it can succeed only by the general and almost 
unanimous desire of the commxmity." A de- 
cided growth of the proletariat " in numbers, 
in solidarity, and in self -consciousness," he be- 
lieves to be inevitable. Optimistic yet sane, 
of strong convictions yet conservative, M. Jaures 
has not laid himself open to the familiar accu- 
sation that Socialists beg the question, for he has 
gone to its very roots. The beauty of his dic- 
tion has been well preserved by his translator. 

It requires more than an ordinary amount of 
mental adjustment to descend from the intel- 
lectual regions whence M. Jaures carries his 
readers to " A Practical Programme for Work- 
ingmen," published anonymously. The author 
has divided his work into three parts, only one 
of which, " The Book of Facts," concerns those 
readers who are not searching for trite aphor-

of private property and competition on the 
one hand and the present impracticability of 
" orthodox " Socialism on the other, he makes an 
amazing suggestion, viz., that the "unwealthy" 
classes organize in order to secure a candidate 
for the next Presidential election, possibly ab- 
sorbing the Democratic party ! The " practical 
programme " itself is then discussed, and a na- 
tionalization and mimicipalization of industries 
is considered expedient in opening the road to 
cooperation. Of the book as a whole it may 
be said that a superabundance of rhetoric has 
somewhat usurped the place of scientific reason- 
ing, and it can hardly be regarded as a serious 
contribution to sociology. 

It is to this spectacular array of the unwealthy 
against the wealthy, more quietly referred to by 
Mr. Spargo as the "class-struggle theory" and 
subtly suggested by M. Jaures in his faith in 
the power of the proletariat, that Mr. Robert 
Flint so strenuously objects in his book on 
" Socialism." The Socialist leaders, he believes, 
by exaggerating the evils of present conditions 
and beguiling their followers by futile hopes, 
have done more harm than good to the work- 
ingman. Written from a non-Socialistic view- 
point, his book is evidently intended as an 
antidote to what he believes to be noxious the- 
ories running riot ; for he states that he proposes 
to discuss Socialism in a way that will be intelli- 
gible to workingmen. It is a keen, scholarly, 
comprehensive work, and presents arguments 
which no Socialist can afford to pass by unchal- 
lenged. It contains, however, one rather serious 
fault as a present-day document : more than half 
of it was written fifteen years ago, when the 
conservative Socialists were less important in 
their class than they now are. Mr. Flint says : 
" It [Socialism] is not a system merely of 
amendment, improvement, reform, — it dis- 
tinctly pronounces every system of that sort to 
be inadequate, and seeks to produce an entire 
renovation of society." This statement is hardly 
applicable to all Socialists to-day, as their pro- 
gramme in England, for instance, bears witness. 
As a criticism of the ideals of Karl Marx and 
his followers, Mr. Flint's work is successful in 
showing their fallacies and in pointing out the 
incompatability of Socialism with Democracy. 
In Socialism, he concedes, there is a large amount 
of good, but " it does not contain any truth or 
any good principle which is exclusively its own." 
In individualism, he sees many faults, but fewer 
from an economic as well as ethical standpoint 
than in any other system yet evolved. It is to 
be noted that the author's attitude toward 



Socialism in its relation to religion — a subject 
to which he attaches very great importance — 
shows the strong influence upon him of the 
Established Church of England. Mr. Flint's 
own arguments are carefully supplemented by 
those of Socialistic and of other non-Socialistic 
writers, making his work comprehensive and 
comparatively free from prejudice. It is a 
valuable asset, not only to sociologists, but to 
all readers who are interested in social problems 
and who are open-minded and intelligent.

The Greatest of French Dramatists.* 



To judge by the absence of books about 
Moliere in English, the English-speaking world 
has been strangely indifferent to the person and 
life of the greatest of French dramatists, the 
one whose name is most often linked with that 
of Shakespeare. Until very recently, Mr. 
Andrew Lang's article in the "Encyclopaedia 
Britannica " was the most substantial biography 
of Moliere accessible to English readers. Ac- 
counts of the man were few and woefidly inad- 
equate. In English books and periodicals there 
was very little to bear witness to the eager and 
fruitful search for all kinds of personal knowl- 
edge about the great author, manager, and 
actor, which, from 1867 to 1890, brought to- 
gether the materials for the two voluminous 
collections molieresques and kept the monthly 
magazine le molieriste going for ten years. But 
the last few years have seen encouraging signs 
of a wider and livelier interest in the great 
Frenchman. The frequency with which Moliere 
is drawn upon to furnish the repertory of our 
amateur Thespians of the French clubs in our 
universities may be such a sign in one direction, 
and the interesting production of " The Misan- 
thrope " by Mr. Richard Mansfield last year 
may be one in a different quarter. Less im- 
peachable evidences, however, are seen in the 
books on Moliere that have appeared. Mr. 
Leon Vincent, after affording us a little glimpse 
of the satirist of the affectations and over- 
refinements of the precieuses in his Hotel de 
Rambouillet, returned to the theme to offer us, 
in 1902, a full-length portrait of Moliere in a 
slight but weU-inf ormed and readable biography. 
Mr. Henry M. Trollope, whose occasional papers 
in the periodical press had long testified to his 
admiration for the creator of Tartuffe and Har-

pagon, and proved how closely he followed the 
course of Moliere study and criticism in France, 
gave to the public, in 1905, a life of Moliere 
that for the first time in English put with ful- 
ness (perhaps with too great fulness) within the 
reach of readers the large mass of detailed fact, 
of gossip and legend, of more or less plausible 
conjecture, and of controversy over moot points, 
that the patient and industrious study of the 
poet's life in France has accumulated. Last 
year we had the Moliere of Mr. Marzials in the 
Miniature Series of Great Writers ; and last, 
and in many ways best, we have the Moliere of 
Mr. Chatfield-Taylor. 

In calling his book " a biography," Mr. 
Chatfield-Taylor has put the emphasis upon the 
man rather than upon the works, and he has 
kept it there pretty consistently throughout. 
This does not mean that he has tried to separate 
the man from his works, or has at all forgotten 
or obscured the fact that the main business of 
Moliere's life was the creation of plays. Per- 
haps he has even failed to make the separation as 
clear as in fact it was, and has been too ready 
to see the man and the circiunstances of his 
life reflected in the works, and to make the 
works confessions of their author's dearest hopes 
and bitterest disappointments. He has treated 
the plays as biographical documents that inter- 
pret and portray the man. Whatever dangers 
this may have in the case of a dramatic author, 
— and especially one like Moliere, whose great 
gift and habit of observation our biographer 
rightly dwells upon, and whose art is so largely 
objective, — it has the advantage of keeping us 
in the region of biography rather than of lit- 
erary criticism. It is the man that we keep all 
the time in view. 

This story of Moliere the man, in his mani- 
fold relations as player, manager, author, court- 
ier, lover, husband, friend, of this career so 
crowded with activity, so full of worthy accom- 
plishment, so absorbed in the pursuit and cap- 
tiire of the comic and so touched with profound 
and tragic pathos, Mr. Chatfield-Taylor has 
told on the whole very well, — more adequately 
than Mr. Vincent and Mr. Marzials, more 
clearly and engagingly than Mr. Trollope. 
There was no need of the words of Professor 
Crane, in the Introduction that he contributes 
to the book, to assure us that the author has 
long been a devoted student of Moliere. He 
shows himseK familiar with the large mass of 
special Moliere literature (at least that in 
French ; the neglect of the Germans is of less 
consequence here than it generally is), and his 



a€Coimt is thoroughly well informed. The na- 
ture of his task, — which was to trace a clear 
and life-like portrait of the man for the larger 
public of readers, and not to make a complete 
collection of material for the special student, — 
forbade hmi to burden his pages with a con- 
siderable apparatus of dociunentary evidence or 
to enter into the minute details of the questions 
in dispute, as Mr. Trollope has done ; yet nothing 
essential has been overlooked, and the student 
will find in the book the main evidence on aU 
controverted matters, and the views and argu- 
ments of the opposing advocates. 

The conclusions that Mr. Chatfield-Taylor 
has reached in these debated questions will 
mainly commend themselves as sound. They 
are generally the ones most favorable to our 
good opinion of Moliere's character. We can 
only approve the biographer's wish to believe the 
best of his hero, and we agree that in Moliere's 
case this wish is for the most part justified. 
There has been altogether too much of a ten- 
dency among his compatriots to admit a sub- 
stantial basis of truth for the malicious gossip 
and downright slander of unfriendly tongues. 
It is quite improbable that the critic of society 
who reveals such moral earnestness in the plays 
should have so flagrantly outraged the sense of 
common decency as some of his biographers 
charge him with doing. We may safely agree 
that " his philosophy was certainly too pure, 
his ideals too exalted , for him to have been the 
vile man his enemies and unwitting friends 
portray." We wonder, however, whether this 
consideration has not been pressed too far in 
the discussion of the great crux of Moliere 
biography, — the question of the parentage of 
Armande Bejart, Moliere's wife. It is rather 
overstating the case to say, as the author does 
in summing up : " If Armande was not Marie 
Herve's daughter, then Moliere, his wife, and 
all her family, must be classed together as 
forgers ; and he, the greatest literary genius in 
France, the friend of the King, be accused either 
of the most abject of crimes, or of an utter dis- 
regard of common decency." But just what 
is " common decency"? Is it defined in identi- 
cal terms in America and in France — and in 
Bohemia ? In deciding whether Armande Bejart 
was the daughter or sister of Madeleine, it is 
possible to suspect that the Anglo-Saxon is 
not so likely as the Frenchman to divine the 
truth that lies behind the tangle of conceal- 
ment and falsehood which that fascinating yoimg 
woman seemed from her birth destined to pro- 
voke. Demonstration is here impossible. One

THE DIAL

is left to a balancing of probabilities, and into 
this many subjective elements are likely to enter. 
We wish to believe that which is most favorable 
to Molifere's moral elevation and delicacy of 
feeling. Here is where the French critics have 
the advantage of us ; and the fact that the ma- 
jority of them incline to the opinion opposite 
to that upheld by Mr. Chatfield-Taylor must 
make us think that they would not concur in 
his statement of the alternative. Has not M. 
Maurice Donnay recently, in V Autre danger, 
condoned after a fashion the offense against 
delicacy of feeling that is here in question ? And 
will delicacy of feeling protect Alceste against 
the witchery of Gelimfene, when all his philo- 
sophy and good common sense are powerless to 
do so? But however we may judge in this 
matter, it is comforting to have to do with a 
biographer who is so loth to believe evil, who 
renders such substantial justice to Madeleine 
Be j art, and who finds good things to say even 
of the incorrigible coquette Armande. 

In one respect our author's commendable 
effort for clearness has had an unfortunate con- 
sequence. We question whether, in presenting 
the plays in groups rather than in the order of 
their production, he has not confused a little the 
outlines of his story and given a somewhat wrong 
idea of the relation of the various groups to one 
another. In spite of the accompanying dates, 
it is hard to avoid the impression that the various 
groups mean different periods in Moliere's dra- 
matic career. This impression is distinctly given 
when the " histrionic plays " are referred to the 
last years of his life, " the period when Moliere, 
worldly wise, experienced as a manager, and less 
zealous as a crusader, was content to write plays 
to fill the coffers of his theater." But the truth 
is that in the years here included, 1668 to 1773, 
we have the same kind of plays as he had been 
producing ever since his talent had appeared in 
its maturity, with VEcole des maris. There was 
the comedy with accompaniment of music and 
dancing which he was bound to provide as pur- 
veyor of amusements to his royal patron ; there 
was the play that appealed primarily to the comic 
sense and the source of laughter ; there was the 
serious comedy of satire, whether of local or uni- 
versal weaknesses ; and there was the play that 
united in various proportions the characteristics 
of aU three. One cannot see that the plays of these 
five years show a very marked difference from 
those of the previous seven. An experienced di- 
rector he had been since his return to Paris ; his 
millitant zeal, against the doctors at least, showed 
no abatement in his very last comedy. His va- 



rious types of comedy were first and last dictated 
by his circumstances and his ideals, which re- 
mained constant. Moliere was director of a com- 
pany, and as such was bound to provide for its 
financial maintenance, which meant attracting 
the great public to his theatre. He was, like 
everyone else, a servant of the King's pleasures, 
and was bound to furnish the kind of entertain- 
ment that his master called for. But he was also 
primarily and always a dramatist, holding firmly 
to ideals of dramatic art of great intellectual and 
moral elevation, and pursuing their realization. 
He was never, last nor first, content to write plays 
merely to fill the coffers of his theatre. The fact 
that he found it possible so often to pursue 
the realization of these ideals to the successful 
end without endangering the material prosperity 
of his theatre has a corollary that the bio- 
grapher of Molifere might well point out. It 
testifies in no uncertain way to the quality of 
the great public on whose support the theatre 
depended. When we reflect what large de- 
mands " The Misanthrope" puts upon the intel- 
ligence of the listener, how completely absent 
are all the spectacular features that count for 
so much with us, as well as everything that 
savors of the horse-play of low comedy, how 
single and unsupported is its intellectual appeal, 
we must wonder how many American cities 
would furnish it as long a run as it had on its 
first appearance. Great as was Moliere's gen- 
ius, his achievement was made possible by the 
high intellectual interests of the society around 
him. 

But one may challenge Mr. Chatfield-Taylor's 
presentation of his materials in these and other 
points, and still assert that his book is the best 
that we have so far in English for the general 
reader who wishes to know the life and work of 
the master of comedy. May the number of 
such increase. 

The book is mechanically satisfying, — only 
we should be glad to exchange the ten original 
illustrations for as many reproductions of por- 
traits of Moliere, or of old drawings of his 
theatre and of dramatic representations of the

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Briefs on ISTeav Books. 



A summary of ^he fifth and concluding volume of 
contemporary Mr. Herbert Paul's "History of 
English history. Modern England " (Macmillan) cov- 
ers the period from 1885 to 1895, and treats pri- 
marily of Ireland, the two Home Rule Bills, the fall 
of Parnell, and of Church affairs. When the first 
volimie appeared there was an inclination to believe, 
from his treatment of free-trade questions, that the 
author had in mind a polemical history that should 
have an influence on the present-day agitation for a 
return to some sort of a protective system in En- 
gland. But this idea was a mistaken one ; and it is 
now evident that Mr. Paul, though inevitably some- 
what biased by his career as a Liberal politician and 
by his present position as a Liberal journalist, has 
merely sought to present a readable chronological 
history of the last fifty years in England. In this 
it may be said that he has succeeded, if one be not 
too critical of what a "history" demands. Mr. 
Paul's work is, in brief, a readable journalistic en- 
terprise, sufficiently accurate in details, but lacking 
in study, in erudition, and in thought, and largely 
deficient in all save avowed political information. 
His sources are simply a few important biographies 
like that of Gladstone by Mr. Morley, and the de- 
bates in Parliament. In the present volume there 
is a note of haste as of one pushing eagerly for- 
"ward toward the end of a task that has grown irk- 
some ; but even here there is attraction for the 
reader, arising from the author's gift in terse and 
striking, if not convincing, characterization. Esti- 
mated as history in its best form, Mr. Paul's work 
has no great value ; but regarded as a rapid sum- 
mary of political events and questions, written in a 
readable style and conveniently arranged for refer- 
ence, it certainly merits commendation. And in 
one particular the author has added to American 
understanding of English contemporary history, — 
for in this volume, as in the preceding ones, he 
emphasizes and makes clear the great political 
significance of , the Church of England, the ques- 
tions that concern it, and its continued importance 
as a political storm centre. 

Lord Rosebery^s Among the many interpretations of 
interpretation of Lord Randolph Churchill that have 
Lord Churchill, appeared since the publication of the 
notable biogi'aphy of him by his son, Mr. Winston 
Churchill, that now presented by Lord Rosebery 
(Harper) is especially valuable for its candid tone 
and its critical judgment. Lord Rosebery was a po- 
litical opponent and yet a close personal friend of Lord 
Cliurchill, and shortly after the latter's death he was 
asked by Churchill's mother to write some estimate 
of her son's career. Until now he has refused to do 
this; but with the appearance of the former biography 
Lord Rosebery feels more free to give voice to his 
own impressions. His book is in reality an essay, to 
be read easily in an hour or so. The historical back- 
ground is very briefly sketched, — so briefly, in fact, 



that to one who has not read the more formal biog- 
raphy much wUl be unintelligible ; so that the main 
interest lies in a comparison of the characteristics and 
abilities here state'd with those emphasized by the 
former biographer. Lord Rosebery brings out, what 
is not clearly indicated in the eai-lier work, the love- 
ableness of Lord Churchill when among his friends ; 
the nimbleness of mind and quickness of wit that 
made him an enjoyable companion; and also the dog- 
matic self-assertion and self-confidence in political 
matters that ultimately wrecked his career. There 
is entire agreement between the two authors, that 
Churchill was one of the cleverest political tacticians 
and one of the best political fighters that England 
has produced in the last half -century. But of his real 
statesmanship Lord Rosebery is not so sure, — by in- 
ference at least leaving the impression that Churchill's 
statesmanship had not yet developed, and that by un- 
fortunately forcing a quarrel with his chief he lost 
forever the chance to make manifest his higher qual- 
ities. In effect, the present author affirms that states- 
manlike qualities of a high order probably existed in 
Lord Churchill, but had not time to ripen ; and here, 
as elsewhere in the essay, the seemingly adverse judg- 
ment is expressed with affection, almost with regret. 
Students of modern English history, especially those 
who have read Mr. Winston Churchill's biogi'aphy 
of his father, will certainly find pleasure and profit 
in a perusal of this discriminating essay. 

The fate of a When, in 1843, a Theatre Regula- 
theatre monopoly tion Bill was passed by Parliament, 
in England. ^^e final step was taken toward put- 
ting an end to an intolerable condition in theatrical 
affairs that had existed ever since Charles II. in 
1660 granted to D'Avenant and Killigrew patents 
conveying exclusive rights to theatrical representa- 
tions. Dr. Watson Nicholson in his " Struggle for 
a Free Stage in London" (Houghton) gives an 
excellent detailed account of the conflict between 
the patentees, the successors of D'Avenant and 
Killigrew, and their opponents, a conflict waged 
with varying success for nearly two hundred years. 
Up to 1720 the sovereigns felt free to interfere as 
they chose with the old patents, and to grant new 
ones. The prerogative of the Crown was unchecked, 
and the Lord Chamberlain had matters wholly in 
his own hands. Exclusive privileges in theatrical 
affairs ceased to be, and the power of the sovereign 
sank into abeyance from lack of exercise. As a 
consequence, unlicensed theatres sprang up, and, 
until they proceeded to attack the government and 
offend public morals, were let alone. Their scurri- 
lous performances, however, led to the Licensing 
Act of 1737, which recognized only the patent 
houses and destroyed all competition. Dm-ing the 
next half century the monopoly was absolute, more 
so than at any previous period of its history. By 
the close of the eighteenth century, however, certain 
minor theatres arose under Parliamentary authority 
to give musical performances and the like, but not 
to present the legitimate national drama. By 1832

these theatres had become so important, the patent 
theatres having meanwhUe sunk to the level of the 
minors, that it was only a question of proper legis- 
lation to wipe away all distinctions. This came in 
the Theatre Regulation Bill above referred to. The 
history is by no means an uninteresting one, and is 
not without its parallels to-day. 

Professor William H. Schofield's 
"English Literature from the Nor- 
man Conquest to Chaucer " (Mac- 
millan) purports to fill a gap in a series projected 
several years ago, which covered the later periods 
of our literary history with three volumes, the work 
of Messrs. GU)sse and Saintsbury. The series as 
planned was to make four volumes, and the history 
of pre-Elizabethan times was to be done by Mr. 
Stopford Brooke. But when Mr. Brooke set to work 
he adopted a much more comprehensive scale than 
his predecessors, and when his volume appeared it 
was found to come down only to the Norman Con- 
quest. The gap thus left has remained for a long 
time, and Mr. Schofield has now undertaken to close 
it up. Since the volume he now publishes (although 
a large one) fills only a part of the vacant space, 
leaving the age of Chaucer still unaccounted for, it 
is evident that he has gone into even greater detail 
than his predecessor, and that the entire six-volume 
history, when completed by the addition of the 
Chaucer volume, will constitute an extremely ill- 
balanced work. This is to say nothing in dispraise 
of any single section of it, and of the section now 
published we can speak only words of commenda- 
tion. It offers an exceptionally thorough treatment 
of its period, done in the light of a scholarly tradi- 
tion that runs from Gaston Paris to Child, and from 
Child to Professors Kittredge and Norton. Essen- 
tial features of Mr. Schofield's method are the 
inclusion of all works written in mediaeval England 
in whatever language, the grouping of works of 
allied character, and the large use made of the com- 
parative method. The volume has a bibliographical 
appendix of great value. 



A feast 
of scrapS: 



Mr. Fitzgerald Molloy's " Sir Joshua 
and his Circle " ( Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
is in no sense a serious writing upon 
the first President of the Royal Academy of Arts. 
It is rather a collection of anecdote and gossip about 
him, his friends, sitters, and acquaintances ; and is 
thus an entertaining centre-table book, as it could 
not help being when it serves up so many interesting 
things about the leading characters that made the 
golden age of England's drama, literature, and art. 
Thus are paraded before us Gainsborough, Hogarth, 
Allan Ramsay the son of the Gentle Shepherd, West 
the Pennsylvania Quaker for whose career Gait's 
faulty pages have been laid imder tribute and his 
errors and mistakes blindly followed, Northcote, 
Fuseli, and Romney, among the painters ; Garrick 
and Siddons, the Emperor and Empress of the stage ; 
Sam Johnson and Goldsmith, Richardson with his 



" Pamela " and " Clarissa," Fielding with his " Tom 
Jones " and " Joseph Andrews," Sterne with his 
"Tristram Shandy,"and Smollett with his "Roderick 
Random," in the realm of letters ; while Lady Sarah 
Lennox and Lady Bolingbroke and their divorces, 
Mary Moser and "Angel" Kauffmann (the two 
women members of the Royal Academy), Fanny 
Burney (better known as Madame D'Arblay), and 
Emma Lady Hamilton and her "mutable connec- 
tions," give spice to the worldly side of life as here 
portrayed. It is true that we learn nothing about 
these people that we have not known before, and it 
may be true also that there is nothing new to be 
learned about them. Mr. MoUoy has re-told the old 
stories fairly well, and produced the sort of book 
that very many people like to read. The lack of 
an index is a serious disadvantage. 

The most '^^® most majestic of all the ancient 

majestic of oriental poetry is that left us by the 

all poetry. Hebrews; and the choicest of it is 

that found in the Psalms. These lyric productions 
have held their place undisputedly at the head of 
all religious poetry. Their universal character and 
their popularity among all religious bodies of Bib- 
lical believers have led scores of scholars to produce 
commentaries and other treatises for their better 
understanding. The latest and most complete treat- 
ment is " The International Critical Commentary on 
the Psalms " ( Scribners), by Professor Charles A. 
Briggs of Union Theological Seminary. This work 
is encyclopaedic in character. It goes thoroughly 
into a discussion of the text, the higher criticism, 
the canonicity, and the interpretation of the Psalms. 
The Introduction, covering 110 pages, is the fullest 
treatment we have seen on all the questions that 
concern a critical study of the Psalter. Particularly 
noticeable is Professor Briggs's theory of Hebrew 
poetry. For a score of years he has advocated a 
regular metrical form that has continually gained 
favor with Hebrew scholars all over the world. This 
theory is applied with great care in this commentary. 
Professor Briggs follows up the minutiae of every 
word and point in such a manner as to convince the 
reader that his work is exhaustive. Another thing 
that strikes the mind of the reader forcibly is the 
absolute certainty with which he assigns the com- 
position of the Psalms to different periods of history. 
In the commentary proper the author's strength is 
shown, in the main, in his treatment of the theo- 
logical questions that arise in the individual Psalms. 
On this point, rather than on the date or linguistic 
phases, this commentary is of especial value to scho- 
lars, for of course it is a book preeminently for them.

express purpose of filling a gap in the series, and 
representing the national literature of the Magyar 
by a thoroughly authoritative treatise. " The book 
is unique in its kind in that it has been wi-itten 
entirely for the English public, and has never ap- 
peared in Hungarian ; indeed, no such work exists 
in Hungary, and it will be as new to the Hungarian 
public as it is to the English." The translation of 
the prose text is the work of Mr. and Mrs. C. A. 
Ginever (the latter a daughter of the Hungarian 
poet GjOry), and the interspersed poetical illustra- 
tions are mainly the work of Mr. G. Hagberg 
Wright, upon whose initiative the book was under- 
taken. Upon examination, it proves to be an ex- 
tremely readable volume, exhibiting scholarship 
without pedantry, and resisting the temptation to 
dwell at too gi-eat length upon the formative period 
of the literature. After eighty pages, or thereabouts, 
we get down to the nineteenth century, which gives 
ample space for an adequate account of the really 
significant modern poets, dramatists, and novelists. 
We extract one amusing bit about the poet Csokonai. 
After his death (1805), the inscription " I too have 
been in Arcadia " was suggested for his tombstone. 
" The poet's fellow-townsmen, the worthy matter- 
of-fact burgesses of Debreczen, did not know what 
it meant. They looked up the name Arcadia in 
Barth^lemy's ' Le Jeune Anacharsis,' and there dis- 
covered the following statement : ' In Arcadia there 
were excellent fields for the rearing of domestic ani- 
mals, especially asses.' They felt hurt, and the 
ensuing controversy would have furnished a suitable 
theme for Csokonai's muse." 



Belated 
admirers 
of Ibsen. 



Now that Ibsen is dead, and has con- 
sequently " arrived," it is curious to 
note the rush of the critics, profes- 
sional and amateur, to the discussion of his work. 
The former kind of critic, after ignoring the dram- 
atist during all the years of his struggle and his 
slowly-ripening triumph, now seems to be saying : 
" This man was really of considerable importance, 
and it is my professional duty to the public to 
appraise him." The recent essays of Professor 
Dowden and Mr. Arthur Symons are cases in point. 
They have " gotten up " their subject too hm-riedly 
to have anything particularly weighty to say about 
it, but their manner is impressive, and we may credit 
them with the discharge of an obligation imposed 
by the sense of their own importance as mediators 
between poet and public. To the amateur critic, 
Ibsen offers, not so much the chance of performing 
a public duty as the chance of attracting attention 
by exploiting a subject of special timeliness. He 
affords a fine corpse in which to flesh their bright 
new surgical instruments. Mr. Haldane MacFall, 
who has just published a book on Ibsen (San 
Francisco : Morgan Shepard), is a typical example 
of this sort of critic. His method is very simple. 
He takes the plays and the letters of the dramatist, 
and has at hand a few standard books (Jaeger, 
Brandes, Gosse, Archer, Boyesen) ; with these ma- 



terials he concocts a running narrative, composed 
of the plots of the plays and the incidents of the 
biography. His individual contribution is a jerky 
emotional commentary, which makes a brave pre- 
tense of being impressive, but exhibits no particular 
insight or sense of perspective. The one really 
original thing Mr. MacFall does is to give Ibsen's 
great contemporary ( whom he mentions repeatedly ) 
the weird name of " Byornsterne Byornsen." This 
amazing exhibition of bad taste (for we cannot char- 
itably ascribe it to ignorance ) needs no comment. 

Some brilliant ^}^^ readable sketches of five brU- 
and eccentric liant and eccentric ladies, cleverly 
court ladies. translated from the French of M. 
Arvede Barine, are published in a handsome volume 
entitled " Princesses and Court Ladies " (Putnam). 
The title is inclusive enough to make room for Marie 
Mancini, Christina of Sweden, the Duchess of 
Maine, the Margravine of Bayreuth, and an Arab 
princess who left her father's harem and gave up 
her title to become plain Frau Reute, wife of a 
German merchant, — and always regretted it. M. 
Barine is already known to English readers through 
two volumes about another princess, la Grande 
Mademoiselle. He writes in a popular style that 
does not obtrude its background of scholarship, but 
nevertheless depends upon it to avoid any suspicion 
of cheapness or superficiality. He presents mooted 
issues, but does not discuss them, aiming to cast 
verified facts into picturesque and dramatic form 
rather than to propound new theories. He has the 
Gallic eye for type, with evidently a keen interest 
in the particular one that he chooses to delineate. 
All his fine ladies have much in common : a brilliant 
but unbalanced mind, a violent temper, superb ego- 
tism, an irresponsible child-like zest for pleasure, 
and a freakish love of romance, which, coupled with 
their other qualities, often leads to wild extrava- 
gances and strange adventures. 

Workers for ^^ optimistic view of American pub- 
pubiicgood lic morality is taken by Mr. Philip 

in America. Loring Allen in his book entitled 
"America's Awakening" (Revell). "That there 
has been an awakening of the American people 
during the opening years of the twentieth century 
is now an accepted fact," says Mr. Allen ; and he 
might have added that it was certainly time for one. 
This awakening, he thinks, " has manifested itself 
in two main forms, the warfare against political 
bosses and the warfare against specially privileged 
corporations. And yet the story of the great move- 
ment for political and business honesty cannot be 
told in the mere list of rascals jailed and new officials 
elected. Above and beyond these concrete achieve- 
ments, there has been a bracing of the moral sense 
of the country that is none the less real because it 
cannot be accurately measured." The book is an 
attempt to measure the extent and reality of this 
moral bracing, through personal studies of the lives 
and political careers of the men who most aided it,

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Ibsen's " Peer Gynt" is now added to the uniform 
edition of his plays published by the Messrs. Scribner. 
The translation is Mr. Archer's, considerably revised, 
and is provided with an extensive historical and critical 
introduction. Another feature of much interest is an 
appendix which gives us translations of the Peer Gynt 
legends as they appear in Asbjomsen's " Eventyr." 

From the Elm Tree Press, Woodstock, Vermont, 
we have a beautifully-printed copy of FitzGerald's 
(here unfortunately printed Fitzgerald) version of the 
" Agamemnon" of iEschylus. The edition is limited, 
and has two portrait illustrations, besides a sketch-map 
of the path of the travelling lire. There are a few 
notes. Good taste chai-acterizes every feature of the 
make-up of this dignified volume, for which we are 
given to understand that Messrs. C. L. Dana and J. C. 
Dana are responsible. 

Dr. Alfred M. Tozzer, who for three years filled the 
research fellowship of the Archfeological Institute of 
America, has made a report of his work, which is now 
published by the Macmillan Co. His subject is "A 
Comparative Study of the Mayas and the Lacandones." 
A publication of allied interest is Mr. Warren K. 
Moorehead's " Narrative of Explorations in New Mex- 
ico, Arizona, Indiana, etc.," published at Andover by 
the Phillips Academy Department of Archaeology. 

" The Mythology of Greece and Rome," by Professor 
Arthur Fairbanks, is published by the Messrs. Appleton 
in their series of " Twentieth Century Text-Books." 
The special pm^ose of the work is " to illustrate the 
wide-reachmg influence of Greek myths first on the 
Latin poets, and, mainly through the Latin poets, on 
later writers." This gives it a general character similar 
to that of Gayley's " Classic Myths," but the illustrative 
material used in the two works is widely different. 

Professor Charles Eliot Norton's Centenary Memoir 
of Longfellow appears in a cheaper edition (price fif- 
teen cents) which will be welcome to many at this time 
of a revival of interest in the poet. The limited large- 
paper edition, with its two photogravure portraits, its 
uncut leaves, and its English cloth covers, will appeal 
to those to whom a work of literature is not always 
more than its raiment. But readers of every class 
must value the book, in whatever shape, both for its 
subject and its authorship. 

Hood and Goldsmith are the latest to take their 
place in the goodly company of " Oxford Poets," pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde. In his preface to the 
Hood volume, Mr. Walter Jerrold states that he has 
been able to include several hitherto uncollected pieces. 
The arrangement of the poems is in the main chrono- 
logical, — a decided improvement over the usual arbi- 
trary division into " serious" and " humorous" sections. 
The Goldsmith volume is a revision and extension of 
Mr. Austin Dobson's Clarendon Press edition of 1887. 
The whole of Goldsmith's poetry is now included, and 
considerable new editorial material is introduced. A 
portrait in photogravure appears in each volume.

in color by Mr. N. C. Wyeth ; " The Iron Way," by 
Mrs. Sara Pratt Carr ; " Indian Love Letters," by Mrs. 
Marah Ellis Ryan ; and " The Story of Bawn," by Miss 
Katharine Tynan. 

A " Large Print Edition " of standard literature is 
announced by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. The 
series will be printed from bold-faced type on thin 
Bible paper, in a form convenient to hold and to carry 
about. Miss Bronte's " Wuthering Heights " and 
Charles Reade's " Love Me Little, Love Me Long " are 
the first volumes announced. 

Those well-known books of a past generation, " Ten 
Acres Enough " and " Liberty and a Living," are to 
have an up-to-date successor in Mr. Bolton Hall's 
"Three Acres and Liberty," which the Macmillan 
Company will publish shortly. In the preparation of 
his facts and figures as to modern cultivation of the 
soil, Mr. Hall has had the aid of several well-known 
specialists in this field. 



" American History and Government, " published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co., is a text book of United 
States history by Professors James A. Woodburn and 
Thomas F. Moran. It is a book for the grammar 
grades, but might be profitably used a little higher up, 
although it falls short of the requirements for senior 
class work in the high schools. 

A " New Classical Library," edited by Dr. Emil 
Reich, is published by the Macmillan Co. The volumes 
are small, and two of them are now at hand. One is 
" An Alphabetical Encyclopaedia of Institutions, Per- 
sons, Events, etc., of Ancient History and Geography," 
and has been prepared by Dr. Reich himself. The 
other offers a translation, by Mr. G. Woodrouffe HaiTis, 
of the first three books of Herodotus. 

Two new volumes will soon be published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in « The Chief Poets Series." 
Their titles will be " The Chief English Poets to the 
Time of Chaucer," edited by Professor C. G. Child, of 
the University of Pennsylvania; and "The Chief En- 
glish Poets from Chaucer to Tottel's Miscellany," 
edited by Professor W. A. Neilson and Dr. Kenneth 
G. T. Webster, of Harvard University. 

Beginning with the January number the famous En- 
glish quarterly, " Mind," is to be published by Mac- 
millan & Co., Ltd., London, and The Macmillan Com- 
pany, New York. Professor G. F. Stout, who has been 
the editor for more than fifteen years, retains that 
position, and Professor E. B. Titchener, of Cornell 
University, remains the American editorial representa- 
tive. The Advisory Committee includes Dr. Edward 
Caird, Professor Ward, and Professor Pringle-Pattison. 

The alumnfe of Bryn Mawr College have undertaken 
to create within the next two years an endowment fund 
of one million dollars, to be devoted to the strictly 
academic needs of that institution. In furtherance of 
this fund the Bryn Mawr alumnse of Chicago have ad- 
opted the novel and somewhat daring plan of present- 
ing at the Auditorium during the week of February 
18 the San Carlo Opera Company in a varied reper- 
toire. This organization, which includes such capable 
artists as Madame Nordica, Sig. Campanari, and Miss 
Alice Neilson, has met with marked success in its tours 
of the past two years, under the direction of Mr. Henry 
Russell. The week in Chicago promises to be a bril- 
liant one, and should result in the substantial advance- 
ment of a worthy educational cause. Nearly S100,000 
has already been raised for the proposed endowment in 
Boston and other cities. 

Two books of special interest m view of the ap- 
proaching tri-centennial of Jamestown, Va., will be 
published this Spring by the Macmillan Company. One 
is the " Travels " of the famous Captain John Smith, — 
" The Generall Historic of Virginia, New England, and 
the Summer Isles, with the Proceedings of those Sev- 
eral! Colonies and the Accidents that Befel them in all 
their Joumyes and Discoveries. By Captaine John 
Smith, Sometymes Governour in those Countryes, and 
Admirall of New England" The rare works that 
make up this volume are here assembled in convenient 
form for the first time since their original publication 
in 1624-30. The edition will contain facsimile repro- 
ductions of all the maps and illustrations in the origi- 
nals, including the rare portraits of the Duchess of 
Richmond and Pocahontas. The other book is " The 
Birth of the Nation : Jamestown, 1607," by Mrs. Roger 
A. Pryor, author of " The Mother of Washington and 
Her Times," and " Reminiscences of Peace and War."

IN A NEW COMIC OPERA 

A Yankee Tourist 



Shakespeare 

" There is an easy answer now to the question often 
put to every student of the stage, 'What is the best 
edition of Shakespeare for a reader of moderate means 
who has not much room for books ? ' This new edition 
by Professor Neilson is easily the best single-volume 
edition that has yet been published. It is the best not 
merely because its editor has wide learning, sound 
judgment, and fine taste, but also and chiefly because 
it takes a step in advance in that it gives us the text of 
Shakespeare's plays, distinguishing sharply between the 
real text as we find it in the quartos and in the first 
folio, and the false text, with its misleading and arbi- 
trary indication of changes of scene and of scenery

The Magazine Reader's Friend 



JN each monthly issue of What's in the 
Magazines the contents, for the same 
month, of nearly one hundred leading peri- 
odicals are classified, indexed, described, and 
commented upon, — all in the simplest and 
most convenient way imaginable. It makes 
accessible to the busy every-day reader the 
entire mass of current periodical literature 
as it appears. Each issue presents a bird's- 
eye view of the magazines of the month, that 
will give one in five minutes the information 
hitherto to be obtained only by long and 
tedious examination of contents-pages on the 
news-stands. It is a periodical that brings 
the other periodicals into a nutshell; and so 
must prove indispensable to everyone who 
would keep in touch with current affairs. 

A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity. The 
multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment 
to those who try to keep in touch with current literature, and despair was heretofore the portion of 
the man who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced. As a handy guide to the things 
one needs or desires, What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest. 

— Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

The value of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will 
b^ rapidly appreciated by the student, the teacher, the specialist in any field of research, the general 
reader and the man of affairs. It is a publication that will admirably supplement '^Poole's Index " 
and the ''Guide to Periodical Literature." — Detroit Evening News. 

So great is the reliance placed upon What *s in the Magazines that the bu^y man and woman 
wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and 
places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader. It is not. however, a 
mere list of contents, nor a complicated index, but each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine contents of the month. Its valus to busy men and women is incalculable.

The law of crime is a branch of jurisprudence peculiarly full of interest. It is linked with history, 
with ethics, with politics, with philanthropy, and should be of the greatest interest to anyone whose 
reading is along the lines which concern the social welfare of the community. The abundance of illus- 
trative examples gives vividness and reality to the abstract principles involved, making them attractive 
to the general reader and of special interest to the law student.

A THEATR ICAL AUTOPSY. 

After a fitful existence of four months, the 
New Theatre of Chicago has closed its doors, 
and the playhouse which has been the scene of 
its praiseworthy enterprise has fallen into the 
hands of the Philistines, to become the resort 
of those for whom dramatic art means no more 
than vapid or vulgar entertainment. The ex- 
periment thus brought to an untimely end has 
cost its promoters upwards of fifty thousand 
dollars, besides other sacrifices that cannot be 
measured in monetary terms. It was an illus- 
tration of honorable endeavor in a deserving- 
cause ; and if that cause seem lost for the time 
being, the outcome must be attributed to mis- 
taken means and methods rather than to any 
inherent defect in the actuating motive. The 
enterprise was prompted by a fine sense of pub- 
lic spirit, and an unselfish desire to contribute 
toward the redemption of our stage from its 
present low estate ; those who were responsible 
for it, and who have seen their hopes rudely 
shattered, have at least the poet's consoling 
thought, 

" Not failure, but low aim, is crime," 
to cheer them in the retrospect. 

Readers of The Dial know how persistently 
it has always stood for the higher ideal of the 
drama, both as literature, and, in its stage- 
production, as an ethical agency. The aims of 
the New Theatre were so clearly in the right 
direction, and its purpose so consonant with 
what we have urged for so many years, that we 
should not be misunderstood if, in analyzing 
the present case, we may seem to speak with 
something like severity of the way in which the 
enterprise has been conducted. All the way 
from start to finish, there were such evidences 
of mismanagement, such an obvious lack of 
intelligent direction, that failure was almost a 
foregone conclusion with the impartial outside 
observer. It is best not to mince matters in 
dealing with this subject, because the experi- 
ment which has now failed is going to be tried 
over again — perhaps many times, — and is 
eventually going to prove successful. And the 
best way to hasten its success must be to under- 



130 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



stand the causes of the previous failure, in order 
to avoid their repetition. 

To begin with, there was an element of un- 
due haste in the starting of the New Theatre. 
Eagerness to be first in the field (of which more 
anon) was responsible for a lack of the neces- 
sary deliberation, and for putting into effect a 
plan that had not been carefully matured. This 
haste was manifested in the choice of both busi- 
ness manager and dramatic director. In both 
cases the selection made was unfortimate, 
although for different reasons. The business 
manager was too practical, and the dramatic 
director was not practical enough. The associa- 
tions of the former were entirely with theatrical 
affairs of the type to which the New Theatre 
sought to stand in the sharpest possible con- 
trast, which made his sympathetic furtherance 
of its aims weU-nigh impossible. The latter 
was a gentleman of remarkable knowledge and 
technical equipment, who nevertheless failed in 
comprehension of the immediate problem pro- 
vided for his solution. He offered the best of 
reasons for the things he did, but they often 
proved to be the wrong things in spite of their 
intellectual defence. And the men who stood 
back of these two executive figures constituted 
an ill-assorted body. Their intentions were of 
the best, but their ideas were illustrative either 
of an innocent helplessness or of an excess of 
the academic spirit, which meant confusion of 
counsel and the inability to define their means 
as definitely as their idtimate purpose was de- 
fined. There was thus inherent in its organiza- 
tion such a lack of harmonious coordination 
among its parts that the enterprise was fore- 
doomed, if not to absolute failure, at least to a 
difficidt course and the making of a blurred 
impression upon the public. 

Now the public has to be taken into account 
very seriously in such an experiment as this ; 
but the new venture was so untactfully heralded 
as to alienate the public at the outset, and to 
make it feel, all the time the experiment was 
in progress, that its cooperation was not partic- 
idarly desired. The idea got abroad that the 
new playhouse was the resort of a coterie, that 
it was a " society " affair, that visitors would 
feel uncomfortable unless they wore evening 
clothes and diamonds. Its sponsors were largely 
of a class better known for the possession of 
worldly goods than for other qualities, and their 
names were advertised much more extensively 
than the names of the performers. They seemed 
to think that the sanction of their presence 



was all that was needed for success, that the 
stamp of their approval woidd magnetize the 
undertaking. They made the fatal mistake of 
establishing a scale of prices that only an extra- 
ordinary attraction could justify, and the sup- 
port of the public — even of that section of the 
public which had been in a receptive mood — 
was forever lost. The opening night filled the 
theatre with a briUiant audience ; the night fol- 
lowing found it comparatively empty. It was 
an " endowed " theatre, so the playbUls said. 
" Very well," replied the public, " those who 
have endowed it may keep it for their own play- 
thing ; it does not interest us, and has no need 
of our encouragement." As for the claim of 
" endowment," it was of course unjustified ; 
all it really meant was that a sufficient sum of 
money had been pledged to provide for a part 
of a single season. 

When the doors of the New Theatre were at 
last opened for the initial production, there were 
revealed a prettily-decorated hall, a stage of toy 
dimensions, and a company of actors most of 
whom had good records as individuals, but 
whose collective performance was hopelessly 
mediocre and even amateurish. As for the 
opening bill, its character was such as to leave 
fairly aghast all serious sympathizers with the 
undertaking. Instead of selecting some strong 
and vital play of the sort for which the institu- 
tion was supposed to exist, the director had 
patched up a progrannne by taking Gilbert's 
" Engaged," mutilating it almost beyond recog- 
nition, and associating with it two small pieces, 
one an insignificant trifle from the French, the 
other a character-sketch by a popular humorist 
of the day. The defence urged for this extra- 
ordinary hodge-podge was that it enabled every 
member of the company to have a part in the 
opening performance. We spoke a little while 
ago of the director's gift of finding excellent 
reasons for doing the wrong things ; this is a 
typical illustration of what we meant. Never 
did a mountain's labor bring forth a more 
ridiculous mouse. From that moment the fate 
of the enterprise was sealed. 

During the four months of life for which it 
was destined, the playhouse conducted a series 
of opportunist experiments which discovered no 
trace of unity of purpose. A play a fortnight 
was the ride, which was followed mitil near the 
end. After the unfortunate first fortnight, a 
really great play — Senor Echegaray's " El 
Gran Galeoto " — was produced. Now this is 
exactly the kind of play for which the New

Theatre was supposed to be created; had it 
been boldly given at the start, or any other 
work of similar rank, the fortunes of the en- 
terprise might have been vastly different. At 
the worst, its eventual failure would have 
been dignified, had such a beginning been made 
and such an ideal been consistently pursued. A 
few good plays were given during the follow- 
ing months — such plays as Herr Fulda's 
"Maskerade," Augier's "Poirier," and Heme's 
"Margaret Fleming" — just such plays as 
should have been given. The other productions 
ranged from the passable through the barely 
admissible to the wholly inexcusable — the 
lowest depth having been reached with a cheap 
melodrama (an adaptation of " The Spoilers "); 
which was not " playing the game," although 
the house was packed for the first and only 
fortnight during its career. 

Further analysis of the case is unnecessary. 
The mistakes already catalogued are enough 
to account for the failure many times over. 
It provides one more example of disinterested 
devotion made futile by hasty effort and faidty 
judgment. The experience has been profitable 
for correction, and the next enterprise of the 
kind will know many definite things to avoid, 
although likely enough to make new mistakes of 
its own. That next enterprise is already much 
more than a dream. It is an effort that has 
been deliberately nurtured for several years, 
that has evolved a comprehensive plan covering 
both the administrative and the artistic aspects 
of the undertaking, and that is now announced, 
with considerable show of definiteness, for in- 
auguration next autumn. It has for its respon- 
sible backing the Chicago Woman's Club, a very 
large and influential organization with many good 
works to its credit, that usually accomplishes 
what it undertakes. The plan would probably 
have been put into practical effect last year, 
had not the New Theatre cut the wind out of 
its sails, for its course was charted long before 
that misadventure was conceived. Its friends 
would not have begrudged the success of the 
rival enterprise, had that been possible ; but 
since it has proved impossible, they expect to 
benefit by the lesson the failure has taught 
them. We are optimistic enough to hope that 
a year from the present date we may be able to 
report the proposed Players' Theatre as an or- 
ganization in active existence, perhaps not over- 
prosperous, but at least assured of continuance 
through the season and through other seasons 
to follow. 



GIOS U E CAR D UCCI. 

One by one the stars go out in the poetical firma- 
ment ; with each extinction the night grows more 
cheerless, and the pilgrim's track, no longer control- 
led by its guiding skymark, is made less certain of 
its goal. This modern world of ours is not so rich 
in poets that it can mark the passing of one of them 
without a pang, and when the voice that is stilled is 
one of such authentic utterance as the voice which 
spoke from the lips of Carducci, the news brings 
with it a sense of grievous and irretrievable loss. He 
was one of the great poets of modern times ; with 
the single exception of Mr. Swinburne, he was the 
greatest poet living in the world when the nineteenth 
century gave place to its successor. And now he is 
dead, after reaching the scriptural limit of man's 
years, and the whole world joins in paying reverent 
tribute to his memory. 

The association of Carducci's name with that of 
his great English contemporary (less than a year 
his junior) is more than fortuitous. The two poets 
are linked by their common devotion to the cause of 
free Italy, for the years of their early manhood 
were those in which that ideal became realized, the 
years of what Frederic Myers calls " the last great 
struggle where all chivalrous sympathies could range 
themselves undoubtingly on one side." And they 
are also linked by certain fundamental principles 
common to both, by their hatred of all forms of 
tyranny, their efforts to bring poetry back to its 
classical modes of expression, their intimate feeling 
for nature, the high seriousness of their thought, and 
the sustained elevation of their poetical flight. 

Giosu^ Carducci was born in 1836, a Tuscan of 
ancient and distinguished lineage. His father was 
a physician by profession and a Manzonian by intel- 
lectual affinity, which meant that the romantic spirit, 
sought to claim the youth for its own. But the in- 
fluence of that spirit, at least in its mediaevalizing and 
catholicizing aspects, was already far spent in Italy, 
and the boy's idealism slowly groped its way from 
Giusti and Manzoniback to Leopardi, then to Dante, 
and then to the Romans, where it took refuge, not, 
however, in any pedantic or servUe sense, but in the 
sense that the freedom and sanity of the classical spirit 
were instinctively felt by the youthful poet, when he 
came into close contact with them, to be his soul's 
own birthright. Meanwhile, his country was prepar- 
ing for its resui'rection. The leaven of Mazzini's 
gospel was spiritualizing the life of young Italy, and 
the first shock of the upheaval had come with the 
great year of revolution, the memorable year of 
1848, which brought only immediate disaster, yet 
nevertheless thrilled the whole world with hope. It 
left the boy of twelve an ardent republican, urging 
upon the petty political leader of his village the 
duty of raising the war-cry, '■^Abasso tutti i re: viva 
la republica!" And a republican in spirit he re- 
mained all his life, serving his country as such in 
both houses of the legislature, although unwilling

to assume the intransigeant attitude of Mazzini, and 
accepting the constitutional monarchy of the Re Gal- 
antuomo as a working compromise in the country's 
political progress to its predestined ultimate good. 
His academic career (for he was a professor more 
continuously and steadfastly than he was a poet) 
hegan at the early age of twenty-three, when he was 
appointed to the University of Pisa. In 1861 he 
entered upon his duties at the University of Bologna, 
which remained the scene of his academic activities 
for upwards of forty years — practically the rest 
of his life. There he lectured year after year, im- 
pressing upon the fortunate youth of new Italy the 
stamp of his rugged and austere personality, incul- 
cating upon their minds his own hatred of shams 
and love of truth, his feeling for all that was worthy 
in the traditions of the race, his devotion to the 
noblest ideals of art and thought and conduct. And 
there, as he grew gray in the service of his nation, 
he drew upon himself, by the might of genius, the 
eyes of Italy and the world, until the Italian people 
came to realize that his modest dwelling in the 
ancient towered city of Bologna housed their greatest 
man, and united in paying tribute to his fame. 

That fame was, of course, for the world at large, 
primarily the fame of the poet ; yet those who knew 
the poet also as teacher and as friend must have 
felt that theirs was a doubly rich possession, for 
there is much testimony to indicate that the mortals 
thus favored were hardly able to tell whether it was 
for Carducci the poet or Carducci the man that they 
felt the greater reverence. And it is well for the 
millions of his lovers who never saw him in the 
flesh to be assured that, had they known him in 
person, or been acquainted with the more intimate 
aspects of his life, their ideal would have suffered 
no impairment. He was, like our own Milton and 
Tennyson, one of the poets who order their lives with 

" Close heed 
Lest, having spent for the work's sake 
Six days, the man be left to make." 

He once wrote that " the poet should express him- 
self and his moral and artistic convictions with all 
the sincerity, the clearness, the resolution in his 
power ; the rest is no concern of his." If we read 
this passage with a heavy emphasis on the word 
" himself," it will be an exact statement of the sum 
of Carducci's poetical activity. 

There was certainly no lack of sincerity, clear- 
ness, or resolution in the famous " Hymn to Satan," 
the poem which first made him a national figure. 
It was written at a single sitting in 1863, and ap- 
pearing in print two years later was hurled like a 
bombshell into the camp of reaction and obscurantism. 

" Salute, o Satana, 
ribellione, 
O f orza vindice 
De la ragione ! 

" Sacri a te salgono 
Gl'ineeusi e i voti, 
Hai vinto il Geova 
De i sacerdoti." 



The note of uncompromising defiance sounded in 
these closing stanzas found an echo in all ardent 
and generous soids, and the advance guard of liberal 
thought throughout Italy turned instinctively toward 
its new leader and rallied about his standard. The 
poet was vilified, of course, misrepresented, and mis- 
understood. He became the storm centre of a fierce 
conflict which is even yet something more than a 
memory. Time has softened the earlier asperities 
of that struggle, and now even those who are the 
poet's intellectual opponents are willing to recog- 
nize the sufficiently obvious fact that the hymn is 
by no means a glorification of evil, but merely the 
expression of a firm determination to inarch with 
" the avenging force of reason " upon the intrench- 
ments of superstition. 

The volume of Carducci's poetry is very con- 
siderable. It includes the "Rime" of 1857, the 
" Levia Gravia " of 1867, the " Decennalia," " Nuove 
Poesie," and " Giambi ed Epodi" of the next decade, 
and the three volumes of " Odi Barbare" published 
from 1877 to 1889. These titles represent the 
landmarks in his poetical career ; but the biblio- 
graphy of the subject is very complicated, owing 
to many republications and rearrangements. The 
" Odi Barbare," which occasioned as much con- 
troversy (although in different circles) as the polit- 
ical and philosophical poems, represented a highly 
interesting attempt to write modern Italian verse in 
classical metres — alcaics, sapphics, and elegiacs. 
This subject would need a volume for its discussion; 
but we may reproduce Carducci's statement that he 
called the poems "barbarous," for the reason that 
" they would so sound to the ears and judgment of 
the Greeks and Romans, although I have wished to 
compose them in the metrical forms belonging to 
the lyrical poetry of those nations; and because they 
will, too truly, so sound to very many Italians, 
although they are composed and harmonized in 
Italian verses and accents." The experiments thus 
characterized have certainly borne the practical test 
of public approval ; many of the poems written in 
these "barbarous" measures are among his best- 
beloved productions. 

The majority of Carducci's poems have not been 
translated into English ; many of them it would be 
unwise to attempt to translate. Now and then his 
English readers have found the temptation irresist- 
ible, and thus a number of the poems may be read 
in creditable English versions. The best of these 
versions with which we are acquainted have been 
made by Mr. Frank Sewall, Mr. G. A. Greene, and 
Mr. M. W. Arms. We regret that Mr. Howells 
and Mr. William Everett did not come down as 
far as Carducci in their books on modern Italian 
poetry. There is still an excellent choice remain- 
ing for the judicious and competent translator. 
And of Carducci's prose, which is of large volume 
and great intellectual significance, there is no rea- 
son why we should not have an adequate English 
■ translation.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Books and the moral coxsciousness have inter- 
relations of more kinds than one. The acquisition of 
coveted volumes by methods other than purchase or 
gift has long been held a venial sin, a mere peccadillo, 
in fact, that should no more cause prickings of con- 
science than do similar modes of acquiring umbrellas. 
The open-shelf system now gaining favor with public- 
library managers and patrons offers extraordinary 
temptations to book-lovers of an easy conscience. The 
librarian of the Oakland (Cal.) Public Library reports 
1808 books missing at the annual inventory — a sad 
testimony to the innate depravity of human nature. 
Comfort, however, may be derived from his confidence 
that these hmidreds of volumes are not all lost to the 
library, but that most of them will come back with the 
same informality that marked their exit. Yet the least 
abuse of a valuable privilege is to be deplored. Do 
open shelves breed contempt for the rights of literary 
property ? A return to chained books would perhaps 
awaken the cidprits to a proper sense of the benefits 
they now so lightly esteem. But there are cheering 
signs in other quarters that not all book-reading com- 
munities are so lax in bibliothecal ethics. The Trenton 
(N. J.) Public Library, for example, allows its patrons 
unparalleled privileges : they have free access to a large 
selection of books and may take home as many as they 
wish — first having them properly charged, of course — 
except that in fiction a borrower must solace himself 
with only one' work at one time. We have, too, the 
librarian's personal assurance that this generosity is not 
abused. And this from the state of New Jersey, almost 
from that palace of political iniquity the New Jersey 
state capitol ! , , . 

Browning in Seattle has as queer a sound as 
"Cicero in Maine," the book-title with which Mrs. 
Martha Baker Dunn startled her readers two years 
ago. But that the city on Puget Sound is not so Klon- 
dike-crazy, so Alaska-mad, so exposition-eager, as not 
to see charms in " Paracelsus " and " The Ring and the 
Book," all may convince themselves by reading, in the 
February " Cornhill," the interesting article on " Brown- 
ing out West " which is contributed by Professor 
Frederick Morgan Padelford at the instance of Dr. 
Furnivall. Mr. Padelford's unexpected and highly- 
gratifying success in conducting a Browning elective at 
the state university of Washington is agreeably narrated 
by him. Browning, he believes, more than any other 
English poet, appeals to the American love of strenuous 
endeavor, to the inquisitive American interest in charac- 
ter-unravelling, the national aggressiveness, curiosity, 
bent for psychological analysis, and fondness for so- 
ciological problems. While the English university ideal 
is culture, and the German university ideal is scholar- 
ship (of the Dryasdust brand), the writer holds that 
the American university ideal is public service, the 
betterment of society. The younger generation wishes 
to become men and women who do things, not who have 
things; and these yoimg men and women find their 
creed worthily formulated in Browning, in his philo- 
sophy of life and his clarion call to spiritual conflict and 
ultimate spiritual triumph. Even his harshness and 
roughness (artistically considered) would seem to work 
for and not against him; at any rate they do not rej^el 
his stalwart disciples of the far Northwest as they tend 
to repel readers in whom the artistic sense predominates. 



The emoluments of authorship have rarely been 
large, but have always furnished a theme for curious 
discussion. Some statistics recently collected con- 
cerning the savings of authors show that seven eminent 
writers, lately deceased, including Edwin Arnold, 
George Gissing, and William Sharp, left estates that 
together amounted to about $65,000, or an average of 
$9,285 apiece — not a prfncely fortime, surely. But 
they have their reward, we must believe, even if it be 
not in the coin of the realm. And of those writers 
whose works are produced solely with a view to mon- 
etary returns, we can truly say that " they have their 
reward " also. The modern saw that " to die rich is to 
die disgraced " has a measure of truth for others besides 
ironmasters. At any rate, the books that have sold by 
the hundred thousand copies, and have filled the authors' 
pockets, are often not the books to look back upon with 
unmixed satisfaction. ... 

Shakespeare and Raleigh are two illustrious 
Elizabethan names that are again to be associated in 
the f oi-thcoming life of the bard of Avon for the " English 
Men of Letters" series by Professor Walter Raleigh. 
Strange enough is it that the greatest name in English 
literature — or in all literature, for that matter — has 
so long been conspicuous by its absence on this roll of 
honor, headed, twenty-nine years ago, by Leslie 
Stephen's life of Johnson» Is it that some dim sense of 
the absurdity of calling Shakespeare a "man of letters" 
has hitherto deterred the publishers from adding his 
name to their list? Or has the difficulty lain in finding a 
biographer of the exceptional qualities requisite for the 
task in hand? Except perhaps Mr. Sidney Lee, no one 
is better fitted to write the projected volume than 
Professor Raleigh. 

Ninety-six novels from the same pen is a remark- 
able record, but that is the number now credited to 
" John Strange Winter," or Mrs. Stannard, as she is 
known in the world of fact. Other work, too, has come 
from her busy hand and brain; and now she confesses 
that she is " tired of writing novels," but that " it does 
not do to be tired of earning one's living." She has 
certainly earned the right to be weary of novel-writing. 
There are those who would be excessively wearied if 
they had even to read ninety-six novels, not to speak of 
writing them. ... 

Shakespeareana manufactured in England for 
THE American trade are now said to lure the dollars 
from the pockets of unwary book-collecting American 
millionaires visiting England — a neat reprisal for our 
heartless carrying off of so many literary treasures from 
that country, notably and very recently the Shelley 
notebooks which our English cousins may well have 
grieved to lose. An ostrich appetite for costly rarities 
can hardly be attended with an Epicurean nicety and dis- 
crimination in picking and choosing. 

Irving's old home in New York, at the corner of 
Irving Place and Seventeenth Street, is in danger of 
being destroyed to make way for modern improvements, 
and a project is now under discussion for its preserva- 
tion, and its conversion into a museum that shall serve 
as a pei-petual reminder of the good old days of literary 
New York. It was this house that Irving occupied 
when his fame was at its height, and the historic struc- 
ture is hallowed by many associations dear to lovers of 
our literature in its early prime.

Some Famous IjIteraby Apostles.* 

Mrs. Charles Brookfield, who with her hus- 
band recently gave us a very pleasant account 
of "Mrs. Brookfield and her Circle," has sup- 
plemented this with another volume of the same 
readable, literary-gossipy sort, containing still 
further reminiscences of her father-in-law, Will- 
iam Henry Brookfield, and his friends — chiefly 
those whose friendship dated back to the " golden 
age" at Cambridge and his student days at Trin- 
ity College. The " Apostles," as is well known, 
were certain bright young men, poetic in tem- 
perament, speculative, inquiring, and whoUy 
fearless, who formed an association called the 
" Cambridge Conversazione Society," at whose 
meetings essays and poems were read, and un- 
tramelled discussion was carried on concerning 
all things in heaven and earth, and a few other 
matters besides. Minuses of these meetings 
were never published, if indeed they were reg- 
ularly kept ; and whether or not the club was 
a hot-bed of radicalism, atheism, and worse, 
was left to the anxious or amused conjecture of 
university authorities and others. Its vigorous 
prime covered the years 1824-1840, and it was 
in this period that, as Trinity was observed to 
contribute the main support of the society, its 
meetings came to be held in that coUege ; and 
as its membership was limited to twelve, it ac- 
quired the jocose nickname of " Apostles." 

Of those who were members of the society in 
its golden prime, Mrs. Brookfield gives sketches 
and letters and traditions of thirteen, her father- 
in-law (who, however, another authority de- 
clares, was not a member at all) claiming first 
place and having more space accorded him than 
anyone else. A bright light he undoubtedly was, 
being a popular preacher, a wit whose presence 
enlivened any company, a Shakespearean reader 
hardly excelled by the Kembles, father or daugh- 
ter, and a thoroughly good-hearted, high-minded, 
pleasant-tempered gentleman. But the distinc- 
tive quality of his wit seems to have been untrans- 
ferable to the printed page : we are repeatedly 
assured of its delicate and delectable flavor, but 
somehow never quite succeed in getting a tooth- 
some morsel into our mouth. Other men's good 
things, which he was fond of repeating, are 
offered us in some abundance, and these help 
one to judge of his taste in such matters. For

example, concerning an estimable man who 
was said to be of exemplary modesty, someone 
ventured to ask, " What has he done to be 
modest of?" This pleased Brookfield, as also 
did Douglas Jerrold's saying, after reading 
Harriet Martineau, " There is no God — and 
Harriet is his prophet." We can imagine him 
enjoying such Elian absurdities as the famous 
question put to the man carrying home a rodent 
of the genus lepus, ",Is that your own hare or 
a wig?" In short, one surmises that Brook- 
field's wit had that delicately subtle and deli- 
ciously unexpected quality that often expresses 
itself largely in gesture and facial expression 
and tone of voice, and that depends for its 
thorough enjoyment on atmosphere and associa- 
tion — on the context, so to speak. Venables, 
a competent authority, says : " In irresistible hu- 
mor none of the ' Apostles' rivalled Brookfield." 
" He had infinite humor," says Kinglake, " but 
humor resulting — like Shakespeare's — from 
mastering of human characters, and not from 
any love of mere shallow, mindless drollery. . . 
I never heard him say a bitter thing." 

Besides Brookfield, whose biography has been 
fully given in " Mrs. Brookfield and her Circle," 
the " Apostles " selected for notice, each in a 
separate chapter, are Blakesley, Buller, Hallam 
(of "In Memoriam"), Kemble, Lushington, 
Maurice, Milnes, Spedding, Sterling, Tennyson, 
Trench, and Venables. Some excerpts are now 
in order ; first one about the " Apostles " col- 
lectively. 

" But trivial assaults the ' Apostles ' could afford to 
ignore, for if they had detractors they had also admirers 
and imitators. W. E. Gladstone founded an Essay Club 
at Oxford on the model of the ' Apostles ' and boasted 
of it — though he owned it never quite satisfied him. 
' The Apostles,' he said, ' are a much more general soci- 
ety.' Blakesley leaves it recorded that it was Arthur 
Hallam who founded this Club, and he probably thought 
this because Hallam had given Gladstone help in the 
drawing up of its rules. ' The Sterling ' was certainly 
inspired by the ' Apostles,' as were numerous other 
societies; and, indirectly, the London Library, an insti- 
tution of an entirely different kind, grew out of it." 

Thackeray, who, though intimate with mem- 
bers of the society, appears never to have be- 
longed to it, was a warm friend and admirer of 
Brookfield, if one may judge from the following : 

" Thackeray admired Brook eld with the ardour of 
a generous nature; he loved to hear him talk, and 
would unweariedly listen to him a whole night through. 
He went to hear his sermons and his readings whenever 
he could; he loved his wit and took it up and used it 
and illustrated it; as also, by the way, did Leech." 

Thackeray has immortalized Brookfield as 
" Frank Whitestock" in " The Curate's Walk. ' 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

And all this warmth of regard was reciprocated 
by its object, even to the extent of disliking the 
novels of Dickens. " Unredeemed trash," is his 
verdict on " The Old Curiosity Shop." Of Brook- 
field as a pulpit orator it may be worth while 
to cite Lord Lyttleton's assertion that he had 
" never heard anyone so easy, almost colloquial, 
insomuch that there was a sort of temptation to 
forget that it was preaching, and get up and 
answer liim." Greville records in his diary : 
" A magnificent sermon from Brookfield. He 
is one of the few preachers whose sermons 
never weary me, however long, . . . and the 
elocution perfect." 

George Stovin Venables is perhaps best 
known as the man who in boyhood, on the 
Charterhouse playground, met his schoolmate 
Thackeray in fistic combat, in response to the 
other's challenge, and did such execution that 
the embryo novelist came out of the engagement 
with a broken nose — and also a lasting affec- 
tion for the breaker, an affection that was 
warmly returned. Venables, barrister and after- 
ward judge, contributed to the literature of his 
day chiefly in the form of anonymous journal- 
ism. The " Saturday Review " and the " Times," 
among other papers, profitted by his scholarly 
attainments. That he had a ready wit, in addi- 
tion to his other accomplishments, is made 
pleasantly apparent. 

" Once when Venables was leaving a dinner party 
where Sir Frederick Pollock also had been he took up 
his hat in the hall, saying, ' Here 's my Castor — 
where 's Pollock's ? ' Always a favoured guest at the 
Grange, he said at a time when he and the world in 
general were much excited over inland travellers, that 
Mr. Parkyns' book on Africa was the most successful 
attempt on record of a man being able to reduce himself 
to the savage state." 

Concerning Hallam, that youth of rare prom- 
ise who died at twenty- two, on the eve of wed- 
ding Emily Tennyson, it must here suffice to 
quote Gladstone's enthusiastic encomium. 

" There was nothing in the region of the mind which 
he might not have accomplished. I mourn in him, for 
myself, my earliest near friend ; for my fellow-creatures, 
one who would have adorned his age and country, a 
mind full of beauty and of power, attaining almost to 
that ideal standard of which it is presumption to expect 
an example. When shall I see his like ? " 

None of the baker's dozen of attractive per- 
sonalities portrayed in Mrs. Brookfield's pages 
is more attractive and more lovable than James 
Spedding, the man who wasted his best energies 
(as many thought) in whitewashing Bacon. To 
Brookfield he was " Spedding the Sublime "; 
FitzGerald called him " old Jem Spedding " 
and " my Sheet- Anchor "; while Thackeray 



playfully dubbed him " Jeames Spending " and 
" that aged and most subtile serpent." Sped- 
ding's early baldness, and the gentle raillery 
evoked thereby, he took with philosophic amia- 
bility. It is pleasant to read FitzGerald's 
friendly and admiring allusions to the Baco- 
nian's lofty and depilated brow, which he some- 
where likens to Shakespeare's. Says Mrs. 
Brookfield : 

" Spedding was a favorite subject for his friend 
FitzGerald's banter. He writes for instance, ' Spedding 
is all the same as ever, not to be improved, one of the 
best sights in London.' When he went to America with 
Lord Ashburnham, FitzGerald said : ' Of course you 
have read the account of Spedding's forehead landing 
in America; English sailors hailed it in the Channel 
mistaking it for Beachy Head.' And later on in this 
visit he mentions that he begins to feel sure that Sped- 
ding would be safe in America, because ' to scalp such 
a forehead was beyond any Indian's power.' " 

Except Henry Lushington, each of the 
" Apostles " sketched by the author's pen is 
also presented in pictorial likeness, the half-tone 
reproductions being from paintings or drawings. 
Spedding's portrait is drawn by his own hand. 
The book, like its predecessor, is handsomely 
made, with clear type, good paper, and an 
index, whose five pages, however, do not con- 
tain all the entries one might have occasion to 
look for — not even all the names of persons 
mentioned in the work. If the book has still 
another fault, it may by the more serious be 
thought to be an unduly generous inclusion of 
pleasant trivialities. However, they entertain 
— or, if not, they may be skipped.

the chapters of my book, it is that I do not wish facts 
to become of too much importance there, of more im- 
portance, that is, than I, the artist, choose, and because 
I will not speak of what I have loved without knowledge." 

Of course if Mr. Hutton prefers not to speak 
of Spain because of insufficient knowledge, well 
and good ; but why, then, label his work " The 
Cities of Spain''? After reading the book, the 
reviewer suggests, as a more fitting title, " Span- 
ish Phantasies " or, " Sobs of the Desert." 

In his practice of the art of literature, the 
author tells us that the country about Toledo 
is '■'-fulfilled with an immense energy, the en- 
ergy of silence." Speaking of a chapel in the 
cathedral at Burgos, he says : " To pray in such 
a place if one were sorry might seem impossible, 
and if one were glad one would go to the hills." 
He gazes upon the " tawny passionate land- 
scape," and the " latent groinings of the hUls.' 
He loves the very look and sound of the words 
"desert,'" "sun," and " stars," and sprinkles 
his pages with them until they resemble a chart 
of the starry firmament itself. " For while 
some have loved women and others have sought 
for fame, and others have flung everything 
away for money," he says, " it is the smi that 
I have loved, the sun which is the smile of God." 
Spain, through this medium, makes an especial 
appeal to Mr. Hutton, who thus further ex- 
presses himself : 

" And, though for no other cause, yet for this I find 
Spain the most beautiful country of Europe: that with 
her abide the mountains and the desert and over all the 
sun. . . . Now, therefore, let us rejoice together, that 
there remains to us a land where these things are; for 
there the wind blows on the mountains, and in the de- 
sert there is silence, and at dawn and at noon and at 
evening we may behold the sun." 

There come times, however, when our author 
finds the sun so hot that he is " afraid "; but we 
feel less concerned about him when we read 
that he is also sometimes frightened at the lack 
of smi. Upon his return to his London home, 
he writes : 

" And a sort of twilight everywhere in this city of 
me^ streets continually makes me afraid and is heavy 
upon me, and there is no sun." 

In other respects he seems an imeasy, restless 
body. When in England, he yearns to escape 
from the " trumpery cities" to the " land of the 
sun and the desert," where " the very boulders 
are writhing in agony to find expression." In 
Spain, however, he longs for England. At the 
Escorial, after wandering through the immense 
corridors, he says : 

" I was thinking of the spring far far away in the 
world where the peach-blossoms flutter over the gar- 
dens like pink butterflies, and the willows are laughing 



together beside the rivers, and the wind is blowing over 
the sea; and I was weary because I was so far away." 

The book, then, is subjective throughout. It 
records Mr. Hutton's sentiments and impres- 
sions, when he is weary, or frightened, or merely 
" sorry." Burgos he finds to be the first city 
he has seen " that verily believes in Christ." 
" She is an image of Faith, of Exaltation in a 
world that is overheated and full of lies and 
greatly desirous." AvUa is " the visible image 
of the word Amen." In the Mosque of Cor- 
dova he " remembered only beautiful things 
and joy." " I lost myself in a new contempla- 
tion ; I kissed the old voluptuous marbles ; I 
touched the strange, precious inscriptions, and 
with my finger I traced the name of God." 

In order better to receive the message that 
Spain has for him, Mr. Hutton frequently 
travelled on horseback. In approaching Avila, 
he says : 

" What she means to those who come to her by rail- 
way, I know not, who saw her like a mirage in the , 
desert after many days. Lost in the infinite silence, 
under the sun and the sky, I had longed for her as of 
old men longed for the Holy City, and when I found 
her at last, I came to her on foot leading my mule over 
the stones." 

Let those disposed to pity Mr. Hutton for the 
hardships that he must have endured upon such 
a trip read the following passage from his Intro- 
duction : 

« Night fell — a night of large, few stars — and cov- 
ered us with her coolness; even yet we were far from 
any city. And at last I could go no further, and told 
my guide so, who without any expression of surprise 
lifted me from my beast, laid me under a great rock, 
covered me with my rug, tethered the mules and began 
to prepare supper. I shall not forget the beauty of that 
night, nor the silence under those desert stars." 

After comforts like these in the open, is it any 
wonder that the failure of the electric light in 
the hotel at Valladolid fairly unmans him ? He 
speaks thus of this fearful experience : 

" The horror of the toilet, in an unknown room, the 
search for the bed with the help of a match, I will not 
describe." 

It is surprising to note, in a book with the 
title " The Cities of Spain " and containing 324 
pages, the amount of space allotted to each city. 
The chapter dealing with Cadiz numbers two 
and one-haK pages ; that which treats of Jerez, 
one and one-half pages by the author, together 
with a wholly irrelevant quotation from an En- 
glish diary of the seventeenth century. Four 
pages are given to Cordova, and four to the 
Escorial, nearly one-half of which is quoted. 
The description of the Alhambra is reprinted 
from Swinburne's eighteenth century account.

while eight of the fourteen pages on Madrid are 
taken from James Howell who wrote in 1622. 
There is a chapter of about sixty pages on the 
Prado Gallery, and another shorter one enti- 
tled "Early Spanish Paintings." The art 
criticism here is vague and unsatisfying, with 
somewhat long historical digressions. 

As an excellent example of Mr. Button's 
style and subject-matter, we quote his closing 
paragraph : 

" For me, at least, Spain remains as a sort of refuge, 
a land of sim and desert. If that be the obscure need 
of your spirit, go to her and she will heal you. For in 
the sun everything is true, all we have hoped and be- 
lieved and at last forgone, all the beautiful things of 
old time when Aphrodite at noon loved Adon, and 
Demeter sought for Persephone, and in the woods and 
on the mountains the women, stained with the juice of 
grapes, followed Dionysos; when, in the dusty ways of 
tfie city, Christ gave sight to the blind, and in the heat 
of the day when the almond trees were shedding their 
blossoms He went by the stony ways to Golgotha. 
And we, too, shall be weary at evening, for he made the 
stars also."

Stukgis's History of Architecture.* 

The first volume of Mr. Russell Sturgis's 
" History of Architecture " is at hand, and the 
two volumes remaining to complete the work 
are scheduled for the present year. The work 
is large in scope, as a brief summary of the 
contents will serve to show. 

Volume I. treats of those epochs and styles 
which are only half known to the modern stu- 
dent — the Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian, 
and later Western Asiatic styles ; Greek art 
down to the final conquest by Rome ; the earlier 
Italian art in its various forms ; the Roman 
Imperial architecture. 

Volume II. treats of the architecture of India, 
China, Japan, and other oriental nations, and 
includes also that Mohammedan architecture 
which arose out of the Byzantine styles. A 
treatment of the great Gothic school of Central 
and Northern Europe brings the history down 
to the fifteenth century. 

Volume III. deals with the fifteenth century 
remodelling of the art of Europe, the French 
florid Gothic, the English Tudor style, and as 
contemporary with these the beginnings of the 
classical revival in Italy, followed by the Euro- 
pean styles of the revived classic or neo-classic. 
Finally, in this volume will be studied the

" anomalous modern conditions, with an expla- 
nation of the failure of the nineteenth century 
in architecture while it was succeeding in paint- 
ing and in sculpture, and with constant effort 
to disentangle the serious attempts at original 
design from the mass of buUding which is un- 
disguisedly copied from earlier styles, and which 
is wholly commercial in its inspiration." The 
record is brought down to the time of " those 
innovations in building which now foreshadow 
complete changes in all architectural style," — 
which last, probably, instead of " changes " 
means the development or evolution of a new 
architectural style. 

The publishers of the work explain that " in 
all this long inquiry the domestic architecture 
of each period is kept in view as offering a 
necessary corrective of conclusions which the 
grandiose architecture of the temple and the 
church, taken by itself, would suggest. This is 
especially the case in more recent times, when 
it is often found that the design of the dwelling- 
house is more nearly akin to refined and noble 
art than is that of the larger and more notice- 
able buildings." This last is a saving clause, 
for it is only in very modern times that domestic 
architecture and monumental architecture have 
failed to develop harmoniously in all essential 
characteristics, and this harmonious develop- 
ment very probably runs back to the earliest 
times ; though the author regrets his inability, 
through insufficient data, to write critically of 
the domestic architecture of such comparatively 
well-known civilizations as those of Egypt and 
of Greece, fearing to trench upon the domain of 
historical romance. 

Architecture is itself a history — a record of 
human desire and activity, of race movement 
and achievement ; and a history of architecture 
may be one or the other of two things, or a 
blending of them. It may be an interpretation 
of the art and a determination of its relation to 
the life and philosophy of the race, showing the 
effect of modes of life and thought upon the 
ideals of the race as expressed in building in 
the abstract ; or it may be a record of technical 
achievement, made forceful by a comparison of 
concrete examples. If it be a judicious blend- 
ins: of the two, it will hold more of human 
interest and be more effective as an educational 
factor in the general evolution of a sympathetic 
knowledge of art. 

Mr. Russell Sturgis, author, critic, and one- 
time architect, comes well equipped for his task 
of formulating critical and comparative judg- 
ments on such material as would naturally form 



188 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



the basis of a great descriptive history of archi- 
tecture. His great knowledge and infinite 
patience, his keen observation and care for de- 
tails even to the counting and recording of the 
number and disposition of brick or stone courses 
in a monumental structure, his capacity for bal- 
ancing part against part and whole against 
whole, render his judgment as a connoisseur 
highly to be respected. As a record of archi- 
tectural events, this history, as evidenced by the 
volume in hand, leaves nothing to be desired. 
The work so far is an admirable example of 
the second form which a history of architecture 
may take, as above stated. Whether the com- 
pleted work will express that most desirable 
blending of human life with technical achieve- 
ment which constitutes art, remains to be seen. 
In the absence of the remaining volumes, the 
publishers' statement on this point may be given. 

" The History of Architecture which we announce 
will discriminate closely between the natural artistic re- 
sults of construction and those methods of design which 
are quite apart from construction and are the result of 
abstract thinking and of the pure sense of form — or, 
in a few cases, of color. An architectural design of any 
kind may have been conceived much as a piece of sculp- 
ture is conceived, that is, as a piece of pure form; and 
it is in this way that much of Greek architecture took 
shape — the simple requirements of the building of the 
time having but little influence upon it. On the other 
hand, with an energetic race of builders like the French 
of the twelfth century, a race not gifted with the sense 
of form to anything like the degree in which it was pos- 
sessed by the Greeks, the merit of a design would na- 
turally be found in the extraordinary logic and in the 
sincerity of the work, the placing of each stone helping 
at once the artistic results and the construction. Those 
are the extremes. Between them is the wide field of 
styles in which both influences are at work." 

The two extremes thus indicated may be denom- 
inated broadly the architecture of "form" and 
the architecture of " feeling," the architec- 
ture of the intellect and the architecture of the 
emotions. The volume before us is dominated 
by the classic ideal, and the emotions have little 
play. The architecture of Egypt which reaches 
emotional depths is treated with too formal a 
touch, and it is only from the illustrations that 
one can fully understand why Greek art stopped 
at the threshold of Egypt, nor sought to com- 
pete with the intellect against the passions. 

A history of architecture which is based on 
race psychology will explain why the pjo-amids 
express the soul of Egypt and of no other 
country ; will explain not only that the columns 
were of magnificent proportions and the lin- 
telled roofs were massive, but also that the dom- 
inating thought in the mind of the race made 
other proportions and less enduring masses im- 



possible ; that the column was not a column, but 
an everlasting support, — that a lintel was not a 
lintel, but an everlasting roof. A study of the 
mind of Greece will show in the changing di- 
mensions of column and lintel not only a develop- 
ment of architectural form but the birth of an 
idea which becomes clear and clean-cut and is 
evolved to its logical limit. A study of the 
Roman temperament will show how it was re- 
flected in an overpowering architecture in which 
the undeveloped idea of the arch and the fully 
developed idea of the lintel were hopelessly con- 
fused and endlessly entangled. Not all of this 
is set forth in the present volume as fully or as 
vividly as the student could desire. Such treat- 
ment does not necessarily take history into the 
domain of romance. A history of architecture 
which is based on the philosophy of life will ex- 
plain how, when Greece bowed to Egypt, the 
exploiters of Roman classic art could have car- 
ried their wares into the presence of the great 
temples of the north and not have been humbled 
into inactivity. This and kindred matters of 
race psychology should find treatment in the 
final volume. It is needless at this time to 
anticipate this treatment further than to suggest 
that perhaps painting and sculpture in general 
have not in the nineteenth century reached a 
comparatively much higher plane than has ar- 
chitecture. Mr. Sturgis's appreciation of sculp- 
ture, as evidenced in the first volume, is very 
sympathetic ; and its treatment is on the side of 
the relation of this art to architecture. The 
present day has made it a thing apart, which is 
not necessarily elevating it to a higher plane. 
Conditions which now surround architecture are 
very different from those of Egypt, Greece, and 
France of the tweKth century; but that does 
not necessarily relegate to a lower plane that 
architecture which characteristically sums up 
these conditions. But in point of fact, we pro- 
duce no great architecture of form, for our in- 
tellects are devoted to the development of the 
sciences ; nor do we produce great architecture 
of feeling, because our emotions are swamped 
in the strenuous hustle of the commercial life. 
Our intellects do not any longer imagine forms, 
they simply remember; our emotions no longer 
throb passionately, they merely flutter. And 
what applies to art applies with more or less 
equal force to the making of books and even 
the writing of history. 

The specimen pages sent out in advance do 
not fairly represent the work. With these in 
mind, one first opens the book with misgivings. 
However, it is pleasing to note that the style is

seK-contained and much in the author's earlier 
manner. The task of collating and arranging 
the great mass of detail has been heavy, and 
the outcome is a work of great value and a mat- 
ter of congratulation to both author and pub- 
lisher. In general make-up, the work is very 
attractive. The letter-press is well-nigh perfect ; 
while the illustrations, which number more than 
four hundred in the first volume, are well chosen 
and extremely well reproduced. The full-page 
plates are carbongravures, while the illustrations 
in the text are half-tones from photographs and 
photo-etchings from line drawings and engrav- 
ings, but so harmonized in scale and so well 
placed that the effect of the whole is pleasing 
to an extent that is not always the case when 
varied means of reproduction are employed. 
The most serious mechanical slip seems to be in 
the inversion of the first half-tone plate in the 
chapter on the Corinthian style. Beyond this 
mishap, too much praise can hardly be given to 
the care which has entered into the artistic 
make-up of the initial volume, and which it is 
to be hoped sets a standard to be followed in 
the remaining ones. Irving K. Pond. 



Washington Life in Early Days.* 

It has been said that we are all gossips at 
heart, no matter how we try to conceal our in- 
terest in our fellows. Even if not belonging 
to a class that likes to listen to gossip over a 
back fence, we may still be of those who wel- 
come a fresh bit of scandal " about Queen Eliza- 
beth." And if history be, as Carlyle avers, 
merely the biographies of great men, is it a 
thing to blush for that we are glad of any new 
light upon their daily lives ? 

The best biographers and diarists have been 
men ; but when it comes to letter-writing, the 
honors between men and women are more nearly 
equal. What an array of bright spirits is evoked 
when we call the roll of women whose letters 
have been given to the world to tell us some- 
what of the precious old days that were before 
Leisure died. It is a sorrowful thought that 
regards these writers as having no present suc- 
cessors ; forecasting a barren future for the his- 
torian who is to come after this prosaic day of 
telephone, telegram, type-writer, and picture- 
postal. 

Since a volume of good old letters is a pos-

session to be grateful for, we must acknowledge 
our obligations to Mr. Gaillard Hunt for his 
careful editing of the correspondence and note- 
books of Mrs. Samuel Harrison Smith in the 
volume which he calls " The First Forty Years 
of Washington Society. " To Mrs. Harrison 
Smith's grandson, Mr. J. Henley Smith, we owe 
a prefatory note in which he tells us that in the 
autumn of the year 1800 Samuel Harrison 
Smith of Philadelphia, the son of Col. Jonathan 
Bayard Smith of the Continental Congress and 
the Continental Army, and a signer of the 
Articles of Confederation, married his cousin 
Margaret Bayard, whose father. Colonel John 
Bayard, had had a public record almost parallel 
in importance with that of Colonel Smith. 
The young pair proceeded at once to Washing- 
ton, where Mr, Smith founded and for many 
years conducted the " National Intelligencer," 
a journal of national circulation which acquired 
a great influence in American politics. Later, 
he was for a short time Secretary of the Treas- 
ury ; he was the first Commissioner of the 
Revenue of the Treasury, and was for many 
years president of important banks. It was 
but natural that his wife should take her place 
among the great ladies of the young capital ; 
and as she had some talent for writing, she be- 
came (anonymously, as befitted the taste of the 
day) a contributor to several journals. She 
also wrote a two- volume novel called " A Winter 
in Washington, " now exceedingly rare, which 
is valuable because of its faithful study of 
Thomas Jefferson. 

Such meagre outlines can easily be filled in 
with light, color, and movement, if one recalls 
that in the Washington of those days there were 
peculiarly favorable opportimities for delight- 
ful social intercourse and intimate friendships 
between people of refinement and intelligence, 
such as are no longer possible in the beautiful 
city seething with politics and slowly but surely 
coming under the benumbing influence of the 
modern commercial spirit. 

Our story opens (to use a favorite phrase of 
the Lady's Book age of American letters) with 
a description of the visits paid to the young 
wife, whose guests were " treated to my wed- 
ding cake." In the next sentence we learn 
that " Mrs. B(ell) brought us a large basket of 
sweet potatoes, and some fine cabbages," — an 
astonishing compliment, surely, to a bride ! In 
returning the visit paid by Thomas Law 
(brother to Lord EUin borough) and his wife (a 
descendant of Lord Baltimore, and a grand- 
daughter of Mrs. Washington) Mr. and Mrs.

Smith were persuaded to remain " and dine off 
a fine turkey"; and they were conducted to the 
kitchen to see a " contrivance " called a 
" Ranger " on which the fowl had been roasted. 
A few days later, a modest gentleman called to 
arrange about the publication of a MS. "as 
legible as printing," which turned out to be 
the work known as "Jefferson's Manual," the 
modest gentleman who brought it discovering 
himself to be its author. Thus are we brought 
face to face with the real hero of Mrs. Smith's 
writings. Her intimate personal study of Jef- 
ferson covers many years, and was conducted 
in many places and through many scenes, but 
always with a loyalty and sincerity which are 
creditable alike to both. 

Following the inauguration of 1801, the 
President's house was presided over by his 
daughters, Mrs. Randolph and Mrs. Eppes, 
with the grace and dignity tliat have given them 
an enviable position among the great ladies of 
American society. The dinners which were fre- 
quently given by Jefferson were laid on a round 
table at which twelve guests were seated ; and 
the letters are filled with the sayings and doings 
of the brilliant men who were making history 
with every sentence they uttered and every 
page they wrote, — men upon whom we have 
come to look as the giants and ancients of our 
own younger and smaller day. Like a thread 
of bright embroidery worked about the historic 
tapestry the men were weaving, are the names 
of the women who created the society in which 
they shone, — Mrs. Madison, Mrs. Cutts, Mrs. 
Monroe, Mrs. Adams, Mrs. Wirt, Mrs. Clay, 
Mrs. Calhoun. Like a panorama, we behold 
the charming home-life of the Jeffersons at 
Monticello and the Madisons at Montpelier ; 
the burning of the Capitol and other public 
buildings by the British, and the flight of the 
terrified Washingtonians. We smile at Mrs. 
Smith's alarm, which leads her to say : " I do 
not suppose Government will ever return to 
Washington. All those whose property was 
invested in the place will be reduced to poverty." 
Smiles are called forth also by her lively por- 
trayal of the scenes during Mr. Clay's Con- 
gressional speech on the Seminole War, which 
is here partly reproduced. 

" When I reached the Hall it was so crowded that it 
was impossible to join my party, and after much hesi- 
tation I consented to allow Mr. Taylor to take me on 
the floor of the House, where he told me some ladies 
already were. In the House, or rather lobby of the 
House, I found four ladies whom I had never before 
seen, all genteel and fashionable, and under the pro- 
tection of Mr. Mercer, who shook hands with me. The 



Senate had adjourned in order to hear Mr. Clay; all 
the foreign ministers and suites, and many strangers, 
admitted on the floor in addition to the members, ren- 
der'd the House crowded. The gallery was full of 
ladies, gentlemen, and men to a degree that endanger'd 
it. Even the outer entries were thronged, and yet such 
silence prevailed that tho' at a considerable distance 
I did not lose a word. Mr. Clay was not only eloquent 
but amusing, and more than once made the whole 
House laugh. . . . Every person had expected him to 
be very severe on the President, and seemed rather 
disappointed by his moderation. \\Tien Mr. Clay fin- 
ished he came into the lobby for air and refreshment. 
The members crowded around him, and I imagine by 
his countenance that what they whispered must have 
been very agreeable. When he saw me he came and 
sat a few minutes by me. I told him I had come pre- 
pared to sit till evening, and was disappointed at his 
speech being so short: he said he had intended to have 
spoken longer, but his voice had given out; he had 
begun too loud and had exhausted himself. . . . The 
gentlemen are grown very gallant and attentive, and 
as it was impossible to reach the ladies through the 
gallery, a new mode was invented of supplying them 
with oranges, etc They tied them up in handkerchiefs 
to which was fixed a note indicating for whom it was 
design'd, and then fastened to a long pole. This was 
taken to the floor of the house, and handed up to the 
ladies who sat in the front of the gallery. I imagine 
there were near 100 ladies there. So these presenta- 
tions were frequent and quite amusing even in the 
midst of Mr. C.'s speech. I saw the ladies near me 
were more accessible, and were more than supplied with 
oranges, cakes, etc. We divided what was brought with 
each other, and were as social as if acquainted." 

No less quotable are passages describing the 
family life of William Wirt ; the excitement 
over the defeat of the now-forgotten Crawford ; 
the social upheaval which has passed into his- 
tory as the Peggy O'Neil incident ; and the 
entertainments given in honor of Miss Marti- 
neau. Upon the deeper character and influence 
of the many notable men about her, Mrs. 
Smith's comments are of no great value. A 
woman's views of men and affairs are at best 
but a woman's views. But a clever woman is 
often able to see and portray the peculiar 
characteristics of an individual or an event in 
a way that is illuminating and valuable. It is 
this quality in the letters of Margaret Bayarh 
Smith that makes their publication well wortd 
while. Sara Andrew Shafer. 



The dramatic awakening at Oberlin, which has 
marked its current college year, gives fresh evidence 
of itself in an announcement, from the classical depart- 
ment, of a projected performance of Aristophanes's

will be the first presentation of a Greek play in English 
translation that Oberlin has seen. (How many plays in 
the original Greek Oberlin has given, we are not told.) 
It is claimed, too, that this will be " almost the first " 
performance of " The Clouds " in any American college.

The FLiIGHT of Marie Axtoinette.* 

An English translation of M. Lenotre's Le 
Drame de Varennes appears with the title 
" The Flight of Marie Antoinette." From the 
bookselling point of view, there is a certain 
utility in the change of title ; but the words 
" Drama of Varennes " suggest more adequately 
the spirit in which M. Lenotre has treated one 
of the most startling and tragic situations of the 
French Revolution. Moreover, in his narrative 
the queen is not the principal figure, although 
she is inevitably the heroine. The interest is 
fitted, from beginning to end, upon the way in 
which every successive obstacle is passed by or 
broken through, until, upon the very threshold 
of security, the royal family is entangled in the 
meshes of new difficulties, which are in part 
simply the debris of previous obstacles swept 
along in the flight. In one sense, the English 
title is more exactly descriptive than the French ; 
for no account is given of the making of the 
plot, the theme is the denouement and the final 
catastrophe, including the humiliating return to 
Paris. 

Those who are acquainted with M. Lenotre's 
other work need not be reminded that he has 
used the historical method as severely in deter- 
mining each detail of the story as if he were 
engaged on a far didler task. He refers to his 
" sources " specifically, and is not afraid to 
insert an occasional long foot-note. But this 
method shoxdd not alarm the general reader. 
The fidness and exactness of the author's in- 
formation has not impaired his sense for the 
requirements of the story. The foot-notes are 
merely pertinent asides, to which the reader 
may refuse to listen. 

The escape from the Tuileries is perhaps the 
most interesting group of incidents in the story, 
though not the most unfamiliar, because a single 
false step might have defeated the design at 
the outset ; and yet the different members of 
the party, in spite of minor mischances, suc- 
cessfully carried out the roles assigned to them. 
The situation was rendered more hazardous by 
the necessity that the royal children be taken 
to Count Fersen's carriage before the coucher. 
The queen personally attended them, with 
Madame de Tourzel, passing through unused 
rooms down toward the brilliantly lighted court- 
yard, where she might be recognized. 

" They paused at the end of an empty room ; through 
the huge glazed door they saw the glimmering lights

of the Carrousel and the groups of people moving in 
the court. The Queen looked out for a moment, and 
then hid herself once more in the gloom. Under the 
cold insensibility afPected by the legal documents, one 
can guess at the anguish that must have wrung the 
heart of Marie Thdr^se's daughter at this fatal hour." 

But she went out, saw the children safely in 
the carriage, and was again in her apartments 
by a quarter to eleven. The king's coucher 
began at eleven. Lafayette arrived fifteen 
minutes later. The king talked with him, but 
seemed preoccupied and went several times to 
the window to observe the weather. The mo- 
ment given the king for his escape was while 
his valet was imdressing in an adjoining room, 
after he had assisted the king into bed and had 
drawn the curtains of the bedstead. When the 
attendant returned, he fastened to his arm a 
cord the other end of which was suspended on 
the curtain near the king's hand as he supposed. 
He then lay down on his own cot, " with his 
customary care lest he should awake his master." 
The further adventures of the family before 
they were installed in the berline are better 
known. 

If one were inquiring about the dangers of 
historical rhetoric, it would be instructive, after 
finishing M. Lenotre's story, to read Carlyle's 
account. Carlyle's positive errors have already 
been pointed out by Mr. Oscar Browning, or 
by the recent editors of the " French Revolu- 
tion," Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Rose ; but the 
trouble is not in these errors so much as in the 
total impression from the narrative, which is 
that we have here ahnost a comedy or farce, 
rather than a drama which is deeply pathetic. 

Among the results of M. Lenotre's special 
investigations is his conclusion about the recog- 
nition of the king. He discredits Drouet's tale, 
showing from the official report of the muni- 
cipality of Ste. Menehould that Drouet only 
suspected the possible presence of the king and 
did not think of communicating his suspicions 
to the municipality until the carriage was gone 
an hour and a half. The king had already been 
recognized much earlier at Chain trix, where the 
carriage arrived at half-past two in the after- 
noon. The royal family took no pains to deny 
their identity, and received the homage of the 
postmaster and his daughters. They were re- 
cognized again at Chalons, and M. Lenotre be- 
lieves that from " this time forward the news 
of the fugitives' approach preceded them." At 
Ste. Menehovdd, a barmaid spread the rumor 
that the king was going to pass ; " everywhere 
the inhabitants gave signs of being already in 
an anxious and over-excited state, everywhere

they crowded along the route of the berline." 
It was this situation, every moment growing 
more ominous, which aggi-avated the difficulty 
of keeping the dragoons at the place where 
Bouille had ordered them to await the coming 
of the royal carriage. 

In one of his supplementary chapters, " The 
Case of Monsieur Leonard," M. Lenotre seems 
hardly consistent with himself. He intimates 
that the alarmist reports spread by Leonard ac- 
count for the failure of the post horses to be at 
their station in Varennes. In the general nar- 
rative, however, he says that the young officers 
in charge of the horses were waiting at the hotel 
Grand Monarque, watching at the open windows 
for the approach of the couriers who should 
tell them that the carriage was nearing the town. 
This statement gives the impression that there 
was a misunderstanding ; for Valory, acting as 
courier, did not enter the town, although he 
reached it a quarter of an hour before the ber- 
line arrived. 

In the supplementary chapters may be found 
examples of the sort of work in M. Lenotre's 
previous books, including four volumes on 
Revolutionary Paris. For the lovers of a good 
story, as well as for those who wish to study 
side-lights on the Revolution, and who may not 
be able to read French, it woidd be fortunate 
were a selection made from these volumes for 
translation. Henry E. Bourne.

altogether delightful blend of invention and humor 
and bookishness and tender pathos and subtly iron- 
ical philosophy. The Vagabond is a masterpiece of 
characterization. Once known to respectability as 
Gaston de N^rac, he has long since sloughed off the 
integuments of convention, and become a joyous 
Bohemian, an oracle of the cafe, a peripatetic phi- 
losopher who can adapt himself to any environment 
that does not mean the submission to artificial 
restraints. The manner of his emancipation was 
this : in his early days of respectability he was be- 
trothed to an English girl, having won her from his 
rival, a French nobleman whose wealth was equalled 
by his depravity. Her father being threatened with 
disgrace, Gaston had made a quixotic bargain with 
his rival, whereby the father was to be saved, and 
the self-sacrificing lover was to disappear, apparently 
deserting his betrothed. All this took place many 
years ago. When the story opens, we find the hero 
in a London garret, and in the act of adopting a 
small boy of the slums, in whose breast he has de- 
tected a spark of genius. This boy joins his fortunes 
with those of his benefactor, receives a surprising 
education from this companionship, and becomes the 
chronicler of all that follows. The dull streets of 
London are soon exchanged for the friendly boule- 
vards of Paris and the sunny highways of France. 
There follow many adveirtures of a more or less 
picaresque nature, interspersed with expositions of 
the vagabond philosophy. Toward the close, there 
is an interlude, occasioned by the death of the 
French nobleman, and his widow's discovery of the 
truth about her old-time lover. She seeks him out, 
their love is declared anew, and he makes a des- 
perate effort to become respectable once more. The 
experiment might have worked had it been con- 
ducted in Paris, but a brief sojourn in an English 
provincial town proves fatal to its success. The 
vagabond tries vainly to submit to the regimen of 
clothes and cleanliness, of abstinence and decorum, 
and makes a pathetic attempt to fit his conversation 
to the vacuous thought of his new associates. After 
a few weeks of silent martyrdom, he can endure it 
no longer, and bolts for his beloved Paris, where he 
relieves his pent-up feelings in a glorious spree and 
the congenial companionship of some amazingly 
abandoned rascals. Having thus restored his equi- 
librium, he weds a buxom peasant damsel, and 
prepares to end his days on a small farm which he 
is just able to purchase with what remains of his 
capital. Ilfaut cultiver notre jardin becomes his 
watchword, Voltaire replacing Rabelais. What we 
have written may do well enough for an outline of 
the story, but it can convey no notion whatever of 
the character of the hero, who is one of the most 
genial and human figures ever encountered within 
the pages of a book. It would take a very stern 
moralist indeed to find him, despite his obvious 
faults, anjrthing but sympathetic and lovable in all 
the phases — even the most sordid — of his pictur- 
esque and eccentric career.

map somewhere in the vicinity of Zenda, and is, 
like most of the states of the mythical group to 
which it belongs, the sjjort of diplomatic intrigue. 
Its prince is sorely beset by enemies, but when he 
acquires a princess, in the shape of a beautiful En- 
glish maiden — transformed from a lowly maid- 
servant into a captivating adventuress — his for- 
tunes change, and he gives his foes a run for their 
money. Unhappily, he is killed just when triumph 
is at hand, and his princess goes into exile cherish- 
ing the memory of the glorious weeks of the con- 
flict. Mr. Hope's hand has lost little of its cunning 
since the days when he invented Zenda, and his 
" Sophy of Kravonia" is a capital story, albeit the 
type is now somewhat worn. 

Mr. John CoUis Snaith is a writer comparatively 
new to fame, but his " Henry Northcote " is a book 
to be reckoned with. It is a tragedy of ambition, 
sombre in its coloring and questionable in its mor- 
ality, but possessed of a compelling force that is far 
out of the common. The hero is a penniless bar- 
rister who must be described as a megalomaniac. 
He is fairly bursting with the consciousness of his 
power to become a leader of men, if only oppor- 
tunity may be granted him, but is meanwhile starv- 
ing in a garret. In the lowest deep of misery, the 
coveted opportunity comes to him in the form of a 
brief, which charges him with the defence of a de- 
praved woman, a murderess whose crime is beyond 
the shadow of a doubt. He conducts the defence, 
and secures her acquittal by an appeal of daemonic 
eloquence to the jury. The tragedy of the situa- 
tion is psychological, for he knows in his heart that 
his plea is sophistical and that his motive is sheer 
personal ambition. This consciousness turns the 
victory to dust and ashes in his mouth, and he is 
almost at the point of renouncing the brilliant posi- 
tion which his forensic triumph has won for him. 
But with a mighty resolve, he casts all scruples to 
the winds, murders the woman whose life he has 
just saved, destroys the evidence of his crime by 
burning the building in which her body lies, and 
faces the future without feeling, as far as we are 
permitted to perceive, a tinge of remorse. This does 
not make a pleasant story, but its gi'ip is undeniable. 
It is also remarkable for the way in which it pre- 
serves the classical unities, for the entire action 
covers only a period of three days. We may add 
that no one who begins to read it will be likely to 
delay as long as that in reaching the closing page. 
The " Call of the Blood " is a wortliy successor to 
" The Garden of Allah," hitherto the masterpiece of 
Mr. Robert Hichens. It offers the same combination 
of glowing color, picturesque setting, and psycholo- 
gical interest. The scene is Sicily, which is suffi- 
ciently tropical a country to justify the warmth of 
treatment which characterized the African romance 
first named. Mr. Hichens works up his material 
with great thoroughness, and in this case, as in the 
other, has submitted himself to the influences of 
the environment until he has become saturated with 
its spirit. His hero and heroine are both English, 



but the former has a strain of Italian blood in his 
veins, and it runs riot when he takes his bride to 
Sicily for the honeymoon. Instincts awake in him 
that might never have declared themselves under 
the gray English skies, and he enters into the joy- 
ous existence of the island peasants and fisher-folk 
with results that prove disastrous. The cause of 
his undoing, and of the wreck of the bride's happi- 
ness, is a girl of the people, whose unsophisticated 
charm stirs his dormant passions, and finally lures 
him to death. For this inevitable outcome every 
chapter and episode of the book help to prepare 
the way, and the author, with a fine artistic mar- 
shalling of his materials, brings the long-impending 
tragedy to its appropriate climax. In respect of 
scene-painting, dramatic construction, and emotional 
force alike, the book deserves unusual praise. 

Owen Davenant, the hero of Mr. H. F. Prevost 
Battersby's "The Avenging Hour," is on his way 
from London to South Wales, where Lord St. Osyth, 
the aged kinsman from whom he expects to inherit, 
lives in a remote castle with the young wife who has 
recently accepted the offer of his hand and what 
remained of his heart. The only other occupant of 
the railway carriage in which Davenant travels is a 
woman of such alluring charm that he cultivates her 
acquaintance as speedily as the circumstances will 
allow, and is aided therein by certain fortuitous hap- 
penings, chief among which is an accident to the 
line which considerably lengthens the journey. To 
put the matter bluntly, he has accomplished her se- 
duction before the journey's end, and then learns, to 
his consternation, that they have the same destina- 
tion, and that she is no other than the wife of the 
kinsman whom he is about to visit. This is a start- 
ling situation indeed, yet a situation managed with 
so much delicacy and literary art as to seem far 
less shocking than it ought to seem, and of course 
really is. The next move in the game is to intro- 
duce the aged husband, and to represent him as a 
very vulgar and disagreeable person, thereby creat- 
ing a distinct prepossession in favor of his erring 
wife. This is deftly done, but even then Davenant's 
decent instincts (for he has them) make his stay 
under that roof intolerable, and he departs on a 
military expedition to Africa, where he takes long 
chances, leads forlorn hopes, and escapes unscathed 
in accordance with the accepted conventions of this 
sort of melodrama. While thus far away news 
comes to him that St. Osyth is dead, but that illict 
love has borne its fruit, and that, by the strictest 
poetic justice, his sin has become the instrument of 
his undoing, for the posthumous child is the legal 
inheritor of the estate. Still later, the child dies, 
which somehow seems to make it possible for the 
lovers to come together, and the whole miserable 
business is patched up after the fashion which was 
to be expected — at least by the confirmed reader 
of modern sex-fiction. The teller of this story dis- 
guises its essential repulsiveness by a skilful use of 
the casuistry of sentiment and the grace of literary 
composition — those insidious devices by which the 



144

modern novelist contrives to blur every principle 
he pleases, and make almost any atrocious act seem 
ethically plausible. 

" Chippinge Borough," Mr. Weyman's new novel, 
is not unprovided with those elements of per- 
sonal and sentimental interest that go to the making 
of popular fiction, but it is essentially a novel of 
political history, and the Reform Bill is its real 
subject. The hazardous fortunes of that measure, 
and its iiltimate triumph, are matters of such tre- 
mendous importance so vividly set forth that by 
comparison the fortunes of the rather colorless hero 
and heroine seem unexciting. It is not that these 
figures, and the others subsidiary to them, are badly 
done, for Mr. Weyman is too skilled a story-teller 
to give us puppets for human beings ; but they 
somehow tend to become accessories to an action 
which has issues far more fateful than those which 
concern any of the individuals involved. Chippinge 
is one of the rotten boroughs menaced by the Bill, 
and barely escapes being wiped off the political map. 
Its two seats have hitherto been the undisputed 
property of one Robert Vermuyden, who is a most 
uncompromising Tory. His kinsman and putative 
heir is a young man who becomes infected with 
radical notions, and is daring enough to oppose the 
Vermuyden interest by joining with the reformers. 
He is also sentimental enough to fall in love with a 
demure schoolmistress, which complicates matters 
a good deal, since the young woman turns out to be 
old Vermuyden's daughter, long mourned for dead. 
The tangle is straightened out, as a matter of course, 
the Bill passes the Lords, and one of Chippinge's 
seats is saved from the wreck. Among historical 
figures. Brougham figures strikingly in the story; 
and among historical happenings, there is a fine 
picture of the Bristol riots. On the whole, we must 
congratulate the author upon what is very nearly if 
not quite the best of all his novels. 

Corsica in the middle of the eighteenth century, 
struggling under Paoli to escape from Genoese rule, 
offers a fine field for historical romance, and Mr. 
Quiller-Couch has made the most of it in his " Sir 
John Constantine." But Paoli is not the hero of this 
tale, for invention has come to the aid of history, 
and supplied more legitimate claimants for the 
Corsican throne in the offspring of one King Theo- 
dore, an adventurer of somewhat shady character, 
but, according to the novelist's scheme, of unques- 
tionably royal authenticity. Brought to the degra- 
dation of a debtor's prison in London, this exalted 
scapegrace obtains succor from an Englishman, Sir 
John Constantine, an old-time lover of the woman 
who, by marriage with Theodore, had become for 
a brief period Queen Emilia of Corsica. He is a 
quixotic old gentleman with an only son, for whom 
he has conceived great ambitions. Between the 
exiled king and the Englishman a bargain is struck. 
Theodore declares that he has no children living 
(although he knows that he has ) and, in considera- 
tion of certain moneys, makes over to Prosper, Sir 
John's son, the royal title. There now remain only 



the invasion of Corsica, the expulsion of the Genoese, 
and the establishment of Prosper upon the throne 
— an easy matter, in the estimation of our modern 
Don Quixote. The army of invasion (numbering 
seven in all) is collected, and sails merrily for the 
Mediterranean. A skirmish with Barbary pirates 
threatens to imperil the expedition, which, however, 
in somewhat battered condition finally lands upon 
the Corsican shores. Hardly has this haven been 
reached, when Prosper falls into the hands of 
brigands, who turn out to be under the leadership 
of a young man and woman, brother and sister, who 
are the legitimate children of Theodore and Emilia, 
and consequently the real heirs to whatever titles 
and dignities those royal personages have the power 
to transmit. But even these young people are with- 
out honor in their native country, for suspicion 
attaches to their past, and meanwhile the Paolis are 
rallying the patriotic forces of the island to their 
own standard. So we have the situation of the 
legitimate heirs to the kingdom fugitives in the 
macchia, and the innocent English pretender a 
captive in their hands. The plot works out by disclos- 
ing the despicable and treacherous character of the 
Prince, and the passionate and high-hearted temper 
of the Princess. The obvious solution (since his- 
torical fact does not permit either Prince or Princess 
or Pretender to achieve a throne) is for Prosper 
and the Princess to fall in love with one another 
(which they do in course of time) and in the end to 
sail away together from the distracted island. As for 
Sir John, he dies fighting the Genoese, and his end 
is no less heroic than the rest of his career. The 
other figures in the romance awaken our interest ; 
he alone commands our love. 

The names of Mr. Eden Phillpotts and Mr. 
Arnold Bennett appear conjointly upon the title- 
page of ''Doubloons." Reading the story, we find 
it to be the tale of a mysterious crime in London 
followed by a mysterious expedition to the Carib- 
bean in search of buried Spanish gold. This com- 
bination of " Sherlock Holmes " and " Treasure 
Island " is pleasing in its simple fashion, but what is 
Mr. Phillpotts doing in that galley ? We refuse to 
associate him with so preposterous a yarn, and in- 
sist that his literary partner must be held chiefly 
responsible. The London part of the story is bet- 
ter than its sequel, and provides a thrill for every 
chapter. After a while, the complication becomes 
so great that there is nothing for it but to cut loose 
and take refuge in foreign parts. Meanwhile, all 
sorts of loose ends are left hanging, and some of 
them are not gathered up at all. 

"The White Plume," by Mr. S. R. Crockett, 
once more drags long-suffering Henry into the lime- 
light. Among those who surround him upon the 
stage are his easy-going consort, the wicked Queen- 
mother with her flying squadron, the other and 
weaker Henry who is King of France, and the sin- 
ister Guise. Far off in Spain, the spider Philip is 
seen in his web in the Escorial, spinning the threads 
of intrigue. A prologue to the tale gives us St.

Bartholomew and the murder of Coligny. Given 
these materials, a historical romance of the conven- 
tional type makes itself, and the considerable interest 
of the present example must be attributed in part 
only to the ingenuity of its fabricator. Still, Mr. 
Crockett has put his historical facts (duly supple- 
mented by sentimental inventions) to skilful use, 
and made the old story quite readable again. 

''The Illustrious O'Hagan" is the title of Mr. 
Justin Huntly McCarthy's new novel, and the 
Illustrious O'Hagan is its hero. The first thing to 
be explained about this hero is that there are two of 
him — twins so closely alike that their friends can 
hardly tell them apart. He (or they) became 
" illustrious " by fighting under the French king at 
Fontenoy. Afterwards, one of him goes to the Morea 
and gets killed. The other, resting on his laurels in 
Paris, is summoned to a little German principality 
to rescue a sweetheart of his youth from her brute 
of a husband. He starts blithely on the adventure, 
and is soon followed by his brother, who is conve- 
niently resuscitated at this juncture, being needed 
in the novelist's business. The scene is henceforth 
in Schlafingen, where the maiden is in sore distress, 
and where we learn that her princely husband is 
even more of a brute than we had ventured to 
anticipate. Since the O'Hagan is now doubled — 
a fact unknown to anyone but himself — he is ena- 
bled to work for her rescue in two places at once, 
which gives him a decided advantage in the game. 
Of course the rescue is effected, and then the super- 
fluous O'Hagan and the brutal prince kill each other 
in a welter of gore, which is just as well for both 
parties, since one of them is not fit to live, and the 
other is badly wanted (for a hanging matter) in 
England. Here ends our entertainment, a romantic 
one withal, and a merry.

Something unique in the way of war 
Mosbv'sRanc/ers ^^^^Yiections is Mr. J. W. Munson's 

in the Uivil IVar. ■»-»•• <• -n*- r^ 

" Reminiscences of a Mosby Guer- 
rilla " (Moffat, Yard & Co. ) . Heretofore the public 
has known little of the real life of that famous war 
band commanded by John S. Mosby, who in 1864 
General Grant tried to capture and hang, who in 
1872 was a political lieutenant of President Grant, 
and in 1907 is said to be one of the advisers of 
President Roosevelt on Southern affairs. This book 
throws much light upon the character of the com- 
mand — its leader, the members, and its methods of 
warfare. There is not a word about constitutional 
theories, nothing about State Rights, no latter-day 
historical philosophizing, no description of conditions 
in the South during and after the war, nothing, in 
short, except a lively account of the fighting life of 
the Forty-third Virginia Battalion of Partisan 
Rangers, commonly known in both North and South 



as " Mosby's Guerrillas." The regular troops of 
the Confederacy thought that too many privileges 
were given to Mosby and his men ; the Federal 
commanders thought that the Rangers ought to be 
hanged, and they did hang some of them, — but 
Mosby retaliated, and since he could hang about a 
hundred to one, he thus stopped that plan of deal- 
ing with his men. Mr. Munson, the author of this 
book, joined the Rangers when seventeen years of 
age and served until the final surrender. Judging 
from the tone of his book, he was much in love with 
the life of the Rangers. Most of his narrative is 
about what he himself saw and took part in. He 
informs us that the chief object of Mosby, who 
operated within the Federal lines, was to secure 
information for Lee and Stuart, to protect Southern 
sympathizers outside of the Confederate lines, to 
capture supplies, and to "annoy the enemy." In 
the latter purpose General Grant complained that 
it took 17,000 of his men to look after Mosby's 
four hundred. The region in which the Rangers 
operated embraced Fauquier and Loudoun counties, 
about a hundred and fifty miles from Richmond, 
near the Blue Ridge Mountains. This was called 
" Mosby's Confederacy," and of Mosby's rule here 
the author says : " During the war all local govern- 
ment in that country was suspended. . . . The 
people looked to Mosby to make the necessary laws 
and to execute them ; and no country before, during, 
or since the war, was ever better governed. Mosby 
would not permit a man to commit a crime ... in 
his domain. One of his men, in a spirit of deviltry, 
once turned over an old Quaker farmer's milk cans, 
and when Mosby heard of it he ordered me to take 
the man over ... to General Early with the mes- 
sage that such a man was not fit to be a Guerilla." 
It was a rare body of reckless young fighters whose 
exploits are chronicled in this volume. With the 
help of this description of the possibilities of guerrilla 
warfare, we may gain a conception of the. service 
rendered to both South and North by General Lee 
when he refused to countenance such a method of 
prolonging the contest. The recent statements of 
Mr. Charles Francis Adams on this point have an 
added force when one thinks of the conditions that 
would have followed had there been hundreds of 
such organizations in the remote districts of the 
South.

his letters, " I must get back to my friends on the 
shelf." He treats of Hazlitt, FitzGerald, Thoreau 
(most admirably, of course), Stevenson, Keats, M. 
Anatole France, sundry matters of style, travellers' 
notebooks, and our alleged lack of a national litera- 
ture. An enamored reader, he writes with a charm- 
ing disclaimer of being anything but a taster and 
relisher. But " self-dispraise goes little ways," as 
the essayist himself admits, and " the good critic is 
he who narrates the adventures of his own mind in 
its intercourse with masterpieces," says M. Anatole 
France, as quoted by Mr. Torrey. Some little mat- 
ters to quarrel over might easily be singled out. For 
instance, when the writer declares that FitzGerald 
"meant to be obscure," is he indisputably in the 
right ? We all know that our English Omar cared 
not for " rank and office and title, and all the 
solemn plausibilities of the world "; but in recalling 
his repeated self-depreciation and his frequent hu- 
morous references to the great world's disregard 
of his literary and critical endowments, one should 
also remember that (to quote Mr. Torrey in another 
connection) "the more considerable a man's gifts, 
the more likely he is to speak disparagingly of 
them." A keen sense of the mocking irony of fate 
in snatching from our reach the very prize we most 
covet and seem to ourselves (in secret) most to 
deserve, is not exactly the same as a deliberate re- 
solve never to win that prize. In his blunt bidding 
of his friends to do no more than acknowledge the 
receipt of his little books, unless they found some- 
thing to censure, may be detected FitzGerald's rec- 
ognition of the perilous sweetness of praise. The 
naturalist peeps forth, welcomely, in many a passage 
of Mr. Torrey's, as for example — a good quotation 
to end with — "If a man is not greater than the 
greatest thing he does, the less said about him and 
them the better. His work should drop from him 
like fruit from a tree. Henceforth let the world 
look after it, if it is worth looking after. The tree 
should have other business." 

, .. What constitutes the vagabond poet 

oowic studies 

of literary or essayist or story-writer ? In his 

vagabonds. ]book, " The Vagabond in Literature " 

(Button), Mr. Arthur Rickett declares the charac- 
teristic qualities to be restlessness, a passion for the 
earth, and constitutional reserve ; and the writers 
whom he finds especially marked by these attributes 
are Hazlitt, DeQuincey, Borrow, Thoreau, Stevenson, 
Jefferies, a;nd Whitman. He distinguishes between 
bohemianism and vagabondage, and though some of 
his distinctions and definitions seem strained, and 
many of his opinions are expressed with the finality 
and certainty of scientific truths, the essays on his 
chosen seven authors are good as literary apprecia- 
tions from a particular point of view, and are likely 
to send more than one reader back again to the 
imperishable pages of the writers discussed. Mr. 
Rickett now and then splits hairs, as in calling De 
Quincey " a simple nature and a complex tempera- 
ment." He speaks of " the frank confidence of his 



Confessions " — as if ingenuous simplicity covdd 
anywhere be found in the rhetorical De Quincey, — 
but later admits that " the difference between the 
editions of De Quincey's ' Opium Eater ' is sufficient 
to show how the dreams have expanded under 
popular approbation." Of the writing of essays on 
Thoreau there is no end in sight. A little search 
discovers half a hundred by authors of more or less 
repute in English and American books and maga- 
zines, besides the increasing number of formal bio- 
graphies. In this field Mr. Rickett says nothing 
strikingly new, but he says enough to betray his 
own unfamiliarity with Thoreau's haunts, if not 
even with his books. We read that " Thoreau turned 
his back on civilization, and found a new joy of 
living in the woods at Maine." The three brief 
excursions into Maine, as related in " The Maine 
Woods," are apparently confused with the sojourn 
at Walden. The expression, " the woods at Maine," 
occurs again later. Perhaps Maine is thought to be 
the town in which Walden Pond lies. Even gram- 
matical slips occur in this unfortunate essay, as 
" The riotous growth of eccentricities and idiosyn- 
crasies are picturesque enough "; and, with a reck- 
less piling up of perfect tenses, " But one would 
have liked to have heard much more about them." 
Borrow is " six foot three " in height. These agree- 
able essays are not epoch-making — how few books 
are ! — but they offer many a page of good reading, 
none the worse for being on well-worn themes. 

Studies in The publishers of Professor W. I. 

the evolution Thomas's volume of studies in the 
0/ Woman. social psychology of sex, " Sex and 

Society" (University of Chicago Press), have 
thought it desirable to issue with it a statement that 
the press notices commenting upon its concluding 
chapter (which appeared earlier in periodical form) 
have caused it to be misinterpreted in the direction 
of an un gallant appraisal of the mentality of the 
gentler and more sensitive sex. It is most unfortu- 
nate that the insatiable reporter should have seized 
upon this material for plying his sensational trade ; 
but since he has done so it is pertinent to state that 
Professor Thomas's volume is a sober and for the 
most part objective study of the influences shaping 
the life of woman, particularly among primitive 
peoples in the longer reaches of uncivilized man- 
kind. So far as deductions go, the conclusion is at 
least equally direct that with the removal of these 
" anthropological " disabilities the mental powers of 
the feminine mind will be released to a freer and 
fuller expression of its capabilities. Apart from 
this concluding chapter, which is indeed open to 
criticism as maintained upon a less consistent plan 
of exposition than pervades the others, the volume 
consists of a group of carefully elaborated and well 
sustained essays upon the organic differences of the 
sexes, the role of sex in primitive social control, 
social feeling, industry, morality, family life, and 
the evolution of modesty ; while the trend of the 
argument is best brought to a focus in the very in-

terestlng chapter upon the adventitious character of 
woman. In these delicate fields, among mooted data 
and conspicuous temptations to hasty inference and 
convenient though misleading formulae, Professor 
Thomas moves with an expert discernment, discloses 
many a shortcoming in prevalent doctrine, and builds 
up a consistent objective picture of woman's socio- 
logical status. Sociology is a new science, and by 
its invasion of a field in which all who run may 
read, and all who read may write or argue, is beset 
with peculiar liability to misinterpretation which 
may take the shape of ridicule. Professor Thomas 
should not be held responsible for the vagaries com- 
mitted under the name of his science, nor for the 
popular distortion to which his views and his subject- 
matter lend themselves. 



Pioneers of 
our national 
expansion. 



The Westward movement, which in 
spite of its preeminent importance 
has only recently begun to receive 
the attention that it should have from students of 
the history of our country, is narrated in a pleasant 
popular manner by Mr. Archer Butler Hulbert in 
his " Pilots of the Republic : The Romance of the 
Pioneer Promoter in the Middle West" ( McClurg). 
As the title indicates, this movement of our popu- 
lation and institutions across the Alleghanies and 
into the farther West is characterized and described 
through accounts, which may originally have been 
popular lectures, of some of the leading "promoters " 
of these various expeditions or enterprises, — those 
heroes and patriots who personally led these pioneer 
undertakings and endured their toils and dangers, 
or those who, hardly less heroes and no less patriots, 
inspired others to undertake the forward movement 
of our national expansion and to sufi^er in many 
cases the fate of pioneers. These men are well 
worth reading about, and any book that can make 
them live again for us of a quieter $nd less adventur- 
ous time is a useful one. The " promoters " whom 
Mr. Hulbert includes are : Washington, the story of 
whose life-long interest in the West and untiring 
efforts to open it to settlement and commerce make 
the most interesting chapter in the book ; Richard 
Henderson, the founder of Transylvania, that first 
invasion of the red men's country west of the 
Alleghany mountains ; Rufus Putnam, the father of 
Ohio ; David Zeisberger, the devoted missionary ; 
George Rogers Clark ; Henry Clay, the promoter of 
the Cumberland Road ; Morris and Clinton, fathers 
of the Erie Canal ; Thomas and Mercer, rival pro- 
moters of railway and canal farther south; Lewis 
and Clark ; Astor, the promoter of Astoria ; and 
Marcus Whitman of Oregon. Sixteen portraits add 
value and interest to the book. 



" The longest 
tcandal of the 
19th century.''^ 



Professor Graziano Paolo Clerici's 
'■'■II piu Lungo Scandalo del Secolo 
XIX." which appeared about three 
years ago in Italy, has been translated and supple- 
mented by Mr. Frederic Clmpman, and handsomely 
published, with many portraits, by Mr. John Lane 



under the title, " A Queen of Indiscretions." Lives 
of Queen Caroline, ill-starred consort of George IV., 
there were already in abundance ; but it appears 
that Signor Clerici has had access to hitherto unused 
" Italian records, both in public departments and in 
private ownership." Consequently his pages pre- 
sent fresh incidents that may modify opinion as to 
the guilt or innocence of the indiscreet lady who so 
narrowly escaped conviction of something worse 
than indiscretion. The Italian author's severity of 
judgment is balanced by the English editor's lenity ; 
and between the two Caroline comes off rather as 
frivolous and frail than as deliberately profligate 
and licentious. The poor foolishly-reared girl was 
by no means a Messalina of wickedness. The mys- 
tery of her early separation from her royal spouse 
remains a mystery still, though the author attempts 
an explanation by comparing George IV. in certain 
emotional and physiological respects to Rousseau, 
and by finding in both (as he thinks) a congenital 
defect incapacitating them for marriage. Even the 
Princess Charlotte's alleged resemblance to her sup- 
posed father is not allowed to invalidate this fanciful 
theory. The English reader well versed in his naval 
history will note the vague reference to Admiral 
Sii" William Sidney Smith as " a certain Sydney 
Smith." The index calls him " Captain Sir Sydney 
Smith "; but under his portrait the name is correctly 
given. The index, by the way, is evidently not the 
work of an expert, its entries being unwisely chosen 
and grouped, and the page references inexact. Under 
" Pergami, Bartolomeo," for instance, at least four 
page numbers lead one astray. There is a lack, too, 
throughout the narrative, of definite acknowledg- 
ment of sources ; the reader follows his author 
blindly. Fifty-seven portraits and portrait-groups 
are interspersed. 

Art of the Again Mr. H. B. Walters comes be- 

ancient fore the reading world with a book 

Greeks. ^^^ ought to be highly valuable, and 

again that world has good reason to be disappointed. 
In " The Art of the Greeks," no less than in his 
" History of Ancient Pottery," the author falls far 
short of his opportunity. The best of the books in 
the same field is now a decade old, and a decade 
makes great changes in the facts and theories of 
archaeology in such an excavating age as ours. 
The new work is far more imposing than the older 
one, more handsome and ambitious ; but it takes 
no account of the Kaufmann head in discussing 
the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles. It dismisses 
Furtwangler's monumental work at Aegina with 
the remark, " A few additions have been made 
from the recent excavations, but nothing of special 
importance." It says of the Farnese Bull, that 
" It was removed to Rome and there preserved to 
this day," when even the most casual visitor to the 
Naples Museum any time these eighty years must 
have seen that conspicuous group, whatever else 
may have escaped him. Such faults are hard to 
excuse ; but the numerous and handsome illustra-

tions do what they can hy way of compensation. 
They are of unusual value, both because of their 
excellence and their variety, and because they repro- 
duce many subjects not otherwise easily accessible 
to the general public. Among such old-time favor- 
ites as the Aphi'odite from Melos, the LaocoOn, and 
the victory from Samothrace, are pictures less often 
seen. Reproductions of vases and of such bronzes 
as the charioteer from Delphi, the youth dredged 
up near the island of Cythera, and Mr. Pierpont 
Morgan's Eros, are so rare except in books designed 
for specialists that it is gratifying to find so many 
and such good ones in this work of more popular 
character. The type is in its way as pleasing to the 
eye as the pictures are in theirs. The publishers 
(Macmillan) have produced such a charming book 
in all external respects that it seems a pity it should 
not be equally satisfying to the mind of the classical 
scholar. 

Sketches of the " ^^^ in Ancient Athens," by Doctor 
golden period T. G. Tucker, Professor of Classical 
of Athenian life. Philology in the University of Mel- 
bourne, is the latest of the Macmillan " Handbooks 
of Archaeology and Antiquities." The volume 
is a treatise on Athenian life at its most attract- 
ive period — that is, roughly speaking, the cen- 
tury beginning with 440 b. c and is presented 

in an easy, readable " footnoteless " form for the 
general reader, although the author endeavors to 
incorporate the results of even the most recent in- 
vestigations. The first sixteen chapters treat of 
such subjects as Public Buildings, Citizens, Out- 
landers, Slaves, Women, Social Day of a Typical 
Citizen, Army and Navy, Festivals, and the Thea- 
tre. The seventeenth chapter deals with the Modern- 
ness of th^ Athenians. The eighty-five illustrations 
are generally well chosen and modern, although not 
a few of them are pretty familiar — the restoration 
of the Acropolis, for instance, being our old friend 
from Schreiber's Atlas. The general style may be 
characterized in the author's words as " the oppo- 
site of pedantic, utilizing any vivacities of method 
which are consistent with truth of fact"; and it must 
be adnjitted that these vivacities are sometimes of 
questionable felicity. On the whole, the volume 
achieves its modest aim, which at once disarms 
criticism ; but it rather suffers from the inevitable 
comparison with some of the other members of the 
same series, as Professor Ernest Gardner's admir- 
able " Handbook of Greek Sculpture," or Professor 
A. H. J. Greenidge's concise presentation of " Roman 

Public Life." 

, Lady Dorothy Fanny (Walpole) 

of " trifiina Nevill, daughter of the third Earl of

of the late Reginald Nevill, has published her 
"Reminiscences" (Longmans) — "this volume of 
trifling reminiscence " she modestly styles the book 
in her dedication to the Marquis of Abergavenny 

and her son, Mr. Ralph Nevill, has acted as her 

editor. Though she begins her book with her birth, 



she, woman-like, omits to record when she was born ; 
nor does she present anything like a full account of 
her life, but touches lightly and pleasantly, some- 
times wittily, on persons and events that have in- 
terested her. Among her favorite pursuits are to 
be noted the collecting of old hand-made buttons, 
and the practice of horticultxxre, wood-carving, and 
book-illumination. Well-disposed toward America 
because she has always found American visitors 
" courteous, clever, and altogether most attractive," 
she yet cannot forgive us for luring Sir Purdon 
Clarke over to New York to preside over the 
Metropolitan Museum, A clever characterization 
of the Greville Memoirs is quoted by her : " It is as 
if Judas Iscariot wrote the lives of the twelve 
Apostles"; also Sir William Harcourt's comment on 
his son's marriage: "I have but one objection — 
that I could not marry the bride myself." The 
writer thinks the purchasing power of money 
greater now than in her youth — which, if it be 
true, cannot long remain so with prices advancing 
at the present rate. Of a very tall custodian at the 
Munich Glyptothek she says, " He might, indeed, 
have been a soldier in the great Frederick's famous 
regiment of giants ! " It was the great Frederick's 
father, Frederick William, who collected giants ; the 
son attached more value to brain than brawn. A 
portrait of Lady Dorothy, from a crayon drawing, 
is provided as frontispiece.

of Reiiuious plied to Prof essor Pratt s study of 
Belief." religious belief, to say that it pre- 

sents a very sane attitude toward the complex data 
involved. Its sanity consists of a wholesome and 
equally a discerning determination to view the facts 
as they are, and as finding an illumination in the 
teachings of modern psychology as embodied in the 
modern man. The sustaining position of the thesis 
is that religious belief, conformably to the status of 
belief as a psychological product, presents itself in 
three forms which are concisely formulated as the 
religion of primitive credulity, the religion of 
thought, and the religion of feeling. The psycho- 
logical foundation of the former is reached in the 
inevitable unanalysed attitude of the psychic novice, 
the child or the savage, — that of acceptance, of 
reaction in a positive and simple manner to the 
situations of life. Among these are beliefs as well 
as customs ; and thus tradition and the religion of 
primitive credulity are formed and preserved. With 
experience comes reason, analysis, and doubt; and 
in the positive religious field, dogma and theology. 
Yet underlying all is the true motive that makes 
mystics of some, brings conversion to others, and 
engenders prayer, devotion, and the sensitiveness to 
the eternal mysteries. These phases are exemplified 
in the great historical religions, as well as in the 
unfoldment of every thoughtful life. They are rein- 
forced in a somewhat novel manner in the present 
volume by an analysis of the responses to a religious 
" questionaire." The author believes strongly in the

temperamental and emotional natiire of the religious 
experience, which in a measure has thus an organic 
foundation in the subconscious mode of reaction to 
the elemental psychic stimuli. As a simple and direct 
presentation of religious-mindedness, the essay is to 
be commended. (Macmillan.) 

Rocks and That a new edition of Dr. George 

thei7- change P. Merrill's " Rocks, Rock Weather- 
mto soils. i„g^ and Soils " is called for speaks 

for the continued usefulness of this well-known 
book. The present edition (Macmillan) follows 
closely the plan of the first one published in 1897. 
As before, the work is essentially a compilation. 
There has been very little attempt to harmonize 
conflicting views, and almost none at independent 
interpretation. The pages devoted to rocks and 
to soils reflect current views rather than suggest 
new ones. The chapters devoted to rock-weathering 
are the best in the book, and constitute in the 
aggregate our most authoritative treatise on this 
subject. In them Dr. Merrill gives the results of 
personal investigations, and is at his best. His con- 
clusions are interesting and suggestive, but subject 
to all the doubt incident to the necessity of making 
in each case a first assumption as to the stability 
of some one element in the rock. The fact that 
the element chosen differs with each rock indicates 
that there is no great certainty as to this assump- 
tion. The book is especially useful to readers who 
desire a knowledge of the general facts and princi- 
ples involved in the study of rocks and their change 
into soils. 



Notes. 



Mr. Booker T. Washington's biography of Frederick 
Douglass, promised last year by Messrs. George W. 
Jacobs & Co. for the " American Crisis Biographies," 
but unavoidably delayed, is to be issued this month. 

Professor W. H. Crawshaw has prepared a new work 
entitled " The Making of English Literature," which 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. will soon publish. The vol- 
ume covers the whole field chronologically, but gives a 
greater part of its space to the more significant authors, 
who are appreciatively interpreted. 

The success of Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson's 
" Upton Letters," " From a College Window," and 
other books, has led to the reprinting of some of his 
earlier work. An entirely new book by Mr. Benson, 
entitled " Beside Still Waters," will be published this 
month by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Professor Charles E. Garman, who died last month, 
completed last June twenty-five years' service as teacher 
of philosophy in Amherst College. In commemora- 
tion of that occasion, thirteen of his former pupils 
presented him with a book entitled " Studies in Philos- 
ophy and Psychology," which they prepared and pub- 
lished through Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Two years ago, Mr. Arlo Bates gave at the Univer- 
sity of Illmois a series of " Talks on Teaching Litera- 
ture." The book now published with that title by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. contains the substance of those 
" Talks," considerably elaborated for publication. It is 



a very interesting and suggestive book, and we particu- 
larly recommend to the teachers into whose hands it 
falls the chapter which tells how Blake's " Tiger " was 
brought by the author within the comprehension of a 
boy of eight. We have rarely seen as sensible a hook 
upon the subject with which it deals. 

The April issue of " Putnam's Monthly " will contain 
the opening chapters of a three-part serial by Mr. 
Maiirice Hewlett, author of " The Forest Lovers," 
" Little Novels of Italy," etc. It is a romance entitled 
" The Countess of Picpus," and records the stirring 
adventures of Captain Brazenhead in a picturesque 
period of French history. 

Commander Peary's complete story of his great Arc- 
tic expedition which made a new world's record and 
planted the Stars and Stripes " farthest north," will 
be published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Company 
this month under the title of " Nearest the Pole." 
There will he an introduction by President Roosevelt, 
and the work will be adequately illustrated from the 
collection of 1,200 photographs taken by Commander 
Peary. 

In addition to E, Phillips Oppenheim's new book, 
" The Malefactor," Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.'s early 
publications include novels by George Frederic Turner, 
an English author; Arthur Stringer, who wrote " The 
Wire Tappers "; Amia Chapin Ray, whose romances of 
modern Quebec are well known; Eliza Calvert Hall, 
a Kentucky writer ; John H. Whitson, who has forsaken 
Western scenes for the East; Ellis Meredith, a Colorado 
author; and Lucy M. Thurston, who wrote "A Girl of 
Virginia." 

Mr. M. S. Levussove's monograph upon the work of 
E. M. Lilien, published by Mr. B. W. Huebsch, will en- 
able the reader to comprehend the motive of an artist 
inspired by the national renascence of the Jews as 
expressed in the modern Zionistic movement. Four- 
teen reproductions from the black and white designs of 
this artist, whose manner reflects that of the Munich 
" Secessionists," bear witness to a symbolism at once 
lucid and forcible, and to the optimistic confidence for 
the future of the Jews as an agricultural race in Pales- 
tine. The work will appeal alike to those who have an 
interest in the rejuvenation of an ancient race, and to 
those who will be attracted by a technique suggestive 
of the skill of Japanese decorators and of the European 
masters of line-work. 

Longfellow's inaugural address at Bowdoin College, 
delivered by him, September 2, 1830, as professor of 
modern languages, has just been published by the Bow- 
dom College Library in a limited edition of 250 copies, 
and may be obtained from Librarian George T. Little, 
Brunswick, Maine, for two dollars (cloth-bound) or 
three dollars (in full flexible leather). This address, 
on the " Origin and Growth of the Languages of 
Southern Europe and of their Literature," was given 
soon after the young Longfellow's return from abroad, 
where he had been fitting himself for the chair estab- 
lished for him at his college. It was his first extended 
essay in prose, it offers a comprehensive survey of its 
subject, and it also illustrates the writer's attitude 
toward literature and poetry. Brief extracts appeared 
in the well-known biography of the poet by his brother, 
but this is the first publication of the address in fuU. 
Printed from the autograph manuscript, it makes a 
volume of 130 pages, four inches by seven. It is a 
book that should appeal to collectors as well as to 
Longfellow lovers.

With pictures in

design by 

N. C. Wyeth. 

Large 12mo. 

$1.50. 



By KATE and VIRGIL D. BOYLES 

This is a capital story about South Dakota in the days when the " rustlers " held 
sway in the cattle country — when they owned the deputy sheriffs and the juries 
— owned almost everybody except Paul Langford and Gordon, the county attor- 
ney. Langford of the Three Bars ranch was the man who had thrown not 
only the whole weight of his personal influence, which was much, but his whole- 
hearted and aggressive service as well, into the long and bitter fight. And Richard 
Gordon was another such, although every one seemed against him and against 
his law. Then there is Jim Munson, a splendid characterization of the real cowboy, whose whole 
life is bound up in the Three Bars " outfit," and against him the sinister figure of Jesse Black, who 
makes all the trouble — and the story as well. Seldom has a book contained so many characters 
that stand for plains life as it actually was in those days, or so many that have the faculty of appeal- 
ing to the reader. In Mr. N. C. Wyeth the publishers feel that they have an illustrator who now 
stands unequalled in this class of work. His pictures have a truth, a strength, and an artistic stand- 
ard that simply compel attention. 

THE IRON WAY 

By SARAH PRATT CARR 

The "Iron Way" is the Central Pacific Railroad. The completion of this 
great enterprise in 1869 provides the material for a story full of action and the 
power of big events. The author has made skilful use of some of the giant 
promoters of that day — Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Mark Hopkins, 
and Charles Crocker, upon whose initiative the railroad was planned and built. 
Of course it is not all railroad, for there is a most attractive love story involving the fortunes of 
Alfred Vincent and Stella Anthony, and there is plenty of the lively action characteristic of California 
in her early days. The railroad is but the vehicle for the tale. 

THE STORY OF BAWN 

By KATHARINE TYNAN 

Miss Tynan has her own field, and her many admirers are perfectly content to 
have her continue in it to the extent of its possibilities. In the portrayal of cer- 
tain aspects of Irish life she has no equal, and her readers have learned to rely 
upon her. Her latest heroine, belonging to an old and honored family in reduced 
circumstances, is not unlike "Julia" and "A Daughter of the Fields," and the 
story of her life is worked out with Miss Tynan's customary delightful sentiment and cheerful 
humor. And again we find the careful avoidance of sensation and theatrical clap-trap which is one 
of this author's greatest charms.

By MARAH ELLIS RYAN 

Seldom have love letters been penned which contained more of the beauty of 
pathos, the poignancy of despair, than these messages, which seem literally writ- 
ten with the heart's blood of the noble-minded Indian who sent them to a girl 
he had loved in the East. But what place could he have in the thoughts and 
life of an American girl of birth and breeding? Yet he was inspired to these 
letters, which breathe the spirit of renunciation and show how inevitable is 
Each one is a veritable prose poem.

HAWAIIAN FOLK TALES 

By THOMAS G. THRUM 

Illustrated from Antiquity as great as that of the Hebrew and Greek is claimed for the vast store 

photographs, of legends and folk-lore of the most picturesque of islands, and the fact that the 

Large 8vo. present work stands for an attempt to rescue them from oblivion is sufficient 

Net $1.75. warrant for it. The mythology, religious functions, tradition and cosmology, 

are treated by students who are authorities in their several fields, and whose 

researches are worthy of a place beside those of Percy, Herder, and Lang. The poetic quality of 

the native legends is faithfully reproduced in the translations, the musical nomenclature of course 

contributing, and there are frequent references to the famous Fornander manuscript, now in the 

possession of the Hon. C. R. Bishop.

With frontispiece. This is the true story of a seven-year old lad who came with his parents to the

COSMOS, THE SOUL, AND GOD 

By Rev. C. L. ARNOLD 

12mo. Y)t. Arnold aims to solve the problem as to the range, and especially the con- 
Net $1.20. nection, between mind and matter. He builds a theory that solves many of the 
difficulties which have long baffled idealist and materialist, and which is abreast 
of the recent discoveries and speculations of scientists ; hence it will be seen that, should this hypo- 
thesis rise to the position of a generally accepted doctrine, its influence on philosophic thought will 
be far-reaching.

By WALTER TAYLOR FIELD 

Handy 16mo. Xo introduce the child to the best writers through their simpler works, letting 
Net $1.00. him approach them at his own level and gradually grow into their greater works, 
as it were — such is the aim of this splendid little volume. And as the exhaus- 
tive and carefully graded bibliographies attest, Mr. Field is the ideal person to accomplish it. He 
discusses juvenile reading from the standpoint of the home, the school, and the library, and believes 
sincerely that the companionship of good books is in many ways the safest one for the child. It is 
a plea that will find a ready response in the mind of parent and teacher, and assuredly of the child 
himself.

and is tempted to " suppress his message." The conflict vrhich ensues between his duty and his

TRU TEXAS WAY. 



Comment is frequently made upon our na- 
tional character as an easy-going people. We 
are so tolerant of abuses, until they become 
unbearably acute, that we submit to all sorts of 
discomforts and petty impositions rather than 
exert the energy needed for their remedy. When 
matters come to a really serious pass, we are 
apt to assert ourselves emphatically enough ; 
but until such a crisis is reached, we are accus- 
tomed to bear the ills we have (and might easily 
be spared) as if they were inherent in the natu- 
ral order. This national trait of ours is respon- 
sible for a great deal of petty annoyance, of 
which we cannot reasonably complain, since we 
make no serious effort to get rid of it. We 
submit to the theatre hat, and the tipping sys- 
tem, and the vulgar newspaper, not indeed 
without a murmur, but without any overt act of 
protest indicative of the courage of conviction. 

Being in this supine and craven state, it may 
be worth our while to heed the lesson of a 
recent happening in a Texas town. Upon the 
occasion in question, an opera company gave a 
performance of " II Barbiere di Siviglia." 
Confiding in the proverbial simplicity of back- 
woodsmen, the director of the company short- 
ened the performance by omitting one act of 
the work. But he reckoned without his host. 
Cidture is abroad in these days, and it hums 
even in darkest Texas. This artistic affront 
caused the worm to turn, and the Texas audi- 
ence expressed its resentment with characteristic 
frontier strenuosity. Riot was incipient ; and 
without mincing words, these Texas champions 
of the artistic ideal expressed themselves with 
point and emphasis, concluding with a demand 
for the return of the money that had been be- 
guiled from their pockets by a delusive prospect. 

The Texas way of dealing with such offences 
may be rough, but it is sharply effective, and 
other communities shoidd profit by the example. 
The same opera company was guilty of the same 
offence in Chicago a fortnight earlier, and also 
of a similar offence in the presentation of still 
another opera. We are not particularly con- 
cerned to exalt " Les Huguenots " as a musical 
masterpiece, but when its performance is an- 
nounced, and when the playbills describe it 
truthfully, as " an opera in five acts," there is, to 



172 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



put the matter mildly, a good deal of bad faith, if 
not actual dishonesty, in omitting the fifth act 
altogether. This is the trick that was played 
upon the Chicago audience ; and there is no de- 
fence in saying that others have played the same 
trick before. Even a Meyerbeer opera deserves 
more respectful treatment than that ; whatever 
artistic quality " Les Huguenots " may have is 
utterly destroyed by abruptly ending the per- 
formance before it reaches its dramatic climax 
in the tragedy of the street scene. It is high 
time for the long-suffering opera-loving public 
to express its resentment at the false pretenses 
(of which the above is one out of many instances) 
that have gone practically unrebuked for as 
many years as we can remember. 

Changing slightly the venue of this discus- 
sion, we may recall the fact mentioned in our 
last issue, when, speaking of the causes which 
led to the failure of the New Theatre, we spoke 
of the director's unconscionable mutilation of 
certain of the plays he undertook to produce. 
This was a particularly wanton proceeding, for 
it was done, not because he thought the plays 
improved by abridgment, but for the inartistic 
purpose of making room on the programme for 
curtain-raisers, — which simply means taking a 
step away from legitimate theatrical enterprise 
in the direction of vaudeville. The chapter of 
theatrical offences of this sort is a long one, and 
every frequenter of the playhouse has suffered 
from them many times. The crimes that have 
been committed against Shakespeare alone would 
require a volume to recount. From Nahum 
Tate and CoUey Cibber to Mr. Mansfield and 
Mr. Sothem, almost every actor or manager 
who has undertaken Shakespearian productions 
has felt perfectly free to make any rearrange- 
ments he might wish, to distort and mutilate 
at his will in accordance with his own crude no- 
tions, of theatrical effect. We may admit, in 
this case, that the conditions of our stage are so 
different from those of the Elizabethan stage 
that some changes are necessary for a modern 
production ; but to say this is by no means to 
condone such perversions as Tate's " Lear " and 
Mr. Mansfield's " Henry the Fifth." Altera- 
tions made in a reverent spirit, with a sense of 
the sanctity of the masterpiece dealt with, may 
be allowed ; alterations made as concessions to 
sentiment or sensationalism, for spectacular pvir- 
poses or the gratification of an actor's personal 
vanity, should be censiired in the strongest 
terms. And in the case of a modern play, 
which has no need of being fitted to modem 
stage conditions, any kind of tinkering is rep- 



rehensible. It is an act of sheer dishonesty 
to advertise a play that already belongs to lit- 
erature, and present something quite different. 
If the play has been changed in any material way, 
the public is entitled to be told beforehand just 
what the changes are, and not left to discover 
them during the course of the performance. 

If dramatic literature suffers severely from 
the sort of treatment here described, those other 
species of literature that make their appeal to 
us solely from the printed page suffer in a far 
greater proportion simply because their volume 
is so much the greater. To catalogue the sins 
of editors and publishers in this respect would 
be an undertaking calculated to stagger the 
most industrious. But we trust that all such 
sinners are finally brought together in Male- 
bolge. They include, among others, the anthol- 
ogists who reprint mutilated forms of famous 
poems, without indicating where omissions have 
been made ; the editors of school and coUege 
texts, who slash their originals right and 
left, with no word of warning for unwary 
students ; the publishers who offer " complete 
works," knowing them to be incomplete, and 
who reprint early editions which they know to 
have been superseded, but without vouchsafing 
a hint of this important fact. The expurgators 
constitute a peculiarly vicious class of these 
criminals, since their sins are so cunningly con- 
cealed as to be almost impossible of detection. 
Does it never occur to these gentlemen that their 
zeal for the suppression of the merely verbal 
forms of literary offence results in a form of 
dishonesty that is far more subtly mischievous 
than the evil (often illusory) which they are 
seeking to minimize ? 

The more we think of the Texas way of deal- 
ing with artistic misrepresentations and false 
pretences, the more we are inclined to applaud 
it. There may be other and better ways, but 
any way is better than none. We should like 
to see every perverter and falsifier of a work of 
art or literature made thoroughly uncomfort- 
able, until the lesson had been so repeatedly 
enforced as to be no longer needed. This is far 
from saying that such works should never be 
altered for any purpose whatever, but it is say- 
ing that they shoidd not be tampered with by 
incompetent bunglers, and it is also saying that 
in the cases which reaUy caU for some judicious 
reshaping or abridgment, the public is entitled, 
as a matter of common honesty, to be exactly 
informed of the nature of whatever changes 
have been made, or whatever liberties taken, 
with the original of the work.

WENDELL PHILLIPS GARRISON. 



The causes of sane literary progress and intelli- 
gent citizenship have seldom had a more faithful 
devotee than Mr. Wendell Phillips Garrison, whose 
death occurred on the 27th of last month. Casting 
in his lot with the late Edwin Lawrence Godkin, 
at twenty-five years of age, he gave his strength and 
talents to " The Nation " with a zeal that knew no 
break until failing health forced upon him the un- 
welcome necessity of laying the burden down with 
the close of the eighty-second volimie, a little more 
than eight months ago. As the known author of 
the keenest and most effective political criticism ever 
developed in the history of American journalism, 
Mr. Godkin's personality could never be merged in 
that of his paper. To many, therefore, " The 
Nation " meant Mr. Godkin, and they never knew 
that there sat at his side a colleague whose labors 
from the very start were as vital to the character 
and success of the paper as those of the brilliant 
political critic himself. Of course Mr. Godkin 
realized the worth of his coadjutor, and the recogni- 
tion which Mr. Garrison's impenetrable modesty 
would not permit to be granted in any public way 
was always most amply bestowed in their private 
intercourse and correspondence. Mr. Garrison's 
preeminent service to " The Nation," and through 
it to the causes for which it has stood, lay in the 
remarkable insight displayed in making up his large 
body of reviewers and contributors, and the success 
with which he held them together. As an illustra- 
tion of this we need only mention that Mr. Goldwin 
Smith, Dr. Daniel C. Gilman, and Prof. Charles 
Eliot Norton have been contributors from the very 
first year, a nucleus for forty years of literary 
criticism which would have done honor to any criti- 
cal jom-nal ever published in the English tongue. 
During the summer of 1905, when some two hun- 
dred of his collaborators united in presenting him 
with a beautiful silver vase, as a token of their per- 
sonal esteem no less than their admiration for his 
editorial ability, the general public learned just how 
far and how carefully Mr. Garrison had been ac- 
customed to search for the right man for any par- 
ticular line of review work or correspondence which 
he desired. And the marvel lies not merely in the 
fact that the list contained so many names of known 
eminence in the world of letters and science, but 
even more in the substantial unity of tone which 
steadily marked the body of criticism coming from 
this numerous, widely separated, differently edu- 
cated and differently circumstanced body of men. 
Of course this unity was no forcible creation of the 
coiTective editorial pencil, although no editor ever 
knew better how to wield that pencil, within legiti- 
mate limits. Mr. Garrison would have scorned 
to make a contributor say what he did not think, 
nor would he have wanted any contributor willing 
to continue as such on that basis. It was his wide 
knowledge of men, coupled with extremely careful 



experiment where previous knowledge was not pos- 
sible, enabling him thus to pick men who shared his 
own high ideals and sincerely believed in the funda- 
mental principles on which those ideals were based, 
that gave the literary criticisms of '' The Nation " 
a unity and steadiness of tone rarely if ever sur- 
passed in the history of critical journalism. A foe 
to all sham, insincerity, and corruption, in letters or 
in life, he stood as unflinchingly for his ideals as his 
father before him had stood for the correction of the 
great wrong of human slavery, and at bottom both 
w'fere fighting against the same enemies — ignor- 
ance, preconceived error, and selfish personal in- 
terests. Whatever other token friends may wish 
to establish in his memory, those eighty-two vol- 
umes of " The Nation " into which his virtues and 
energies were so unstintingly poured, with their 
steady appeal to that enlightened intelligence and 
morality upon which the progress of civilization 
must always depend, constitute a monument the 
fitness of which can never be excelled. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A poets' trade-union has been formed in England, 
or so we are told by Mr. Andrew Lang in a pleasant 
little article contributed to the London " Chronicle " ; and 
when Parliament shall have passed the biU draughted 
by the xmion's secretary, Mr. Baunder, " a gentleman of 
prosperous aspect, with a strong German accent," En- 
gland will speedily become a veritable " nest of singing 
birds." By the provisions of this bill every citizen will 
be forced to buy annually a new volume of poetry — 
or, rather, a volume of new poetry — for every twenty 
poiuids of income that he has over three himdred 
pounds a year. Thus a prosperous merchant, or soap- 
boiler, or tallow chandler, with an income of two thou- 
sand pounds, let us say, will piu-chase eight hundred and 
fifty poetry books of the latest make every twelve 
mouths, at a uniform statute price of six shillings net. 
This protection to poets is considered necessary because 
poetry is at present so much less popidar than, for 
instance, history, archseology, and ethics; whereby it 
has come about that, as Herr Baunder affirms, " the 
poets are remorselessly sweated; thousands of them 
cannot earn any wage at all, not to speak of 'living 
wage.' A guinea for a sonnet; what do you think of 
that ? " Shameful, in good sooth, and we hope for the 
early passage of the Baunder Bill — but with an impor- 
tant additional clause. It should provide for pass exam- 
inations to be undergone by all purchasers of poetry, to 
ensiu-e that such poetry is read as well as bought. Not 
only must the hoi'se be led to water, but he must be 
made to drink, and drink deeply, at the Pierian spring, 
under penalty of a heavy fine, or lingering incarceration, 
or both. How else infuse in the people a true and 
lasting love of divine poetry ?

dense ignorance of the poet, puts the query why the 
venerable Russian has not been prevented by those 
around him from making an unedifying display of him- 
self, and suggests that some friend or relative should 
take steps to spare him the humilation that must attend 
a further exhibition of the decay now undermining his 
mental powers. Another great writer, Mr. George 
Meredith, who has just passed his eightieth milestone, 
is thought by many to have his impulses of unwisdom. 
His prose output, ceasing to take the form of fiction — 
his last novel came out twelve years ago — has of late 
appeared in the shape of rather excited political utter- 
ances, and of a sensational and much-discussed sm- 
gestion as to the expediency of probationary wedlock. 
That an author who toiled so strenuously in early man- 
hood — spending his last guinea on one occasion for a 
sack of oatmeal, on which he subsisted while writing a 
book — and who has done so much good work and 
raised himself to rank as one of the very foremost of 
living English prose writers, and as no mean poet, 
should now be suffered to do anything that may, even 
temporarily, dim the lustre of his renown, is to be de- 
plored. Few are the writers that can wield the pen, as 
did Dr. Martineau and Mrs. Somerville and Alexander 
von Humboldt, with even more power at eighty and 
over than at forty or fifty.

The U8E8 OF fiction, recently referred to in these 
columns under the heading " Fiction as a Rest Cure," 
should have included " Fiction as an Advertising Me- 
dium." The fiction-writer of the future, in order to be 
pecimiarily successful, may have to specialize as rigor- 
ously as does the historian or the scientist of to-day. At 
any rate, this is the opinion which such advertisements 
as the following might incline one to form. The first is 
from a London literary review of the highest standing. 

' ' The Editor of the Talking Machine News requires stobies 
(1,500 to 2,500) with a Talking Machine motif. Technical ac- 
curacy essential. Suitable articles would also be entertained. 
Specimen copy on application." 

The second is from a great city daily of equally high 
rank. 

"$75 Prize Stories. We want a short story of about 3000

our booklet, ' Some Shoe Beforms.' Address," etc. 
Many an artist, trained in the schools of Paris or 
Munich, has come at last to turn his back on " art for 
art's sake," and now earns a comfortable, sometimes a 
more than comfortable, livelihood as a designer of 
posters, anonymous works of art that are never rejected 
by an examining committee, and if they are elevated to 
the skies are all the more conspicuous. Who knows 
how many zealous and gifted followers of Scott and 
Dickens and Thackeray may be glad some day to 
answer just such advertisements as the foregoing ? 
Fortunately or unfortunately, the crowding of the pro- 
fessions is making such things increasingly possible.

The new uteraky movement among the Spanish- 
American PEOPLES has for one of its first fruits a 
little volume of tales and prose poems, Noche Tragica, 
by the Cuban poet, Senor Arturo R. de Carricarte. It 
is noteworthy how much of the strong, tragic work of 
the day is coming from Southern sources. Out of the 
sunshine, out of the flowers, out of the gay life of 
the semi-tropic lands, come books as terrible and soul- 
shaking as their earthquakes and eruptions. The 
French and Italian tragedians deal less with the outward 
conditions of life — sociological problems, questions of 



reform or change — than do their Northern compeers. 
They are avid of the elemental human passions. As a 
result, their work has a certain beauty and splendor, 
where that of Ibsen and Tolstoi and Turgenieff and the 
German dramatists is homely if not ugly. On the 
other hand, the best work of the North has a mystic 
glamour which the South knows nothing of. Noche 
Tragica is a good example of the school we have been 
describing. It is a tale which M^rim^e would have 
liked. Fate, in it, is masked in flowers, but marches 
onward with implacable tread. All of Sefior de Carri- 
carte's pieces have a sombre soul beneath a bright ex- 
terior. In some of the prose-poems he shows an acute 
sensibility to natural phenomena — like a Maurice de 
Gudrin translated to the tropics. According to a cus- 
tom more observed on the Continent of Europe than in 
England or America, there is prefaced to this little 
book a long essay by Senor Ricardo del Monte, the 
most brilliant of Cuban critics. This discourse is a keen 
examination of modern thought and literary creation. 
It is always instructive to get at a different view-point 
from our own. Senor Del Monte is at the centre of a 
horizon quite other than ours. The stars of modern 
literature arrange themselves to his eyes in a different 
way than they show in our sky. The constellations 
of France since 1830 blaze overhead. Single Italian 
or Spanish or German stars mount or descend. But 
only a few English suns peer above the horizon, 
and the Russian and Scandinavian and American hosts 
of light are invisible. 

The last photograph of Longfellow, not in fin- 
ished form, but in the negative — from which no posi- 
tive had ever been printed — has been accidentally 
discovered by a yoimg lad in South Boston, a photo- 
grapher's assistant. The story of this forgotten photo- 
graph is interesting. In late February, 1882, the poet 
was walking along Brattle street, Cambridge, when he 
was accosted by a friend, a Mr. Allen, photographer, 
who asked him to sit for his likeness before a new lens 
that he, Allen, had just bought for his camera. Long- 
fellow refused to visit the studio, but at last consented 
to pose on his own veranda; and there, only a month 
before his death, he sat for what proved to be his last 
portrait. The negative, filed away and lost sight of, 
passed with the rest of the photographer's outfit into 
other hands, and in a subsequent removal of the busi- 
ness to its present location the precious piece of clouded 
glass was trundled along with a pile of other un- 
considered negatives. Pulled forth very recently by 
chance, and held up to the light by an apprentice in a 
moment of idle curiosity, it was fortunately recognized 
by him; and now its owner would not part with it for 
love or money. Coming to view twenty-five years after 
it was taken, and a hundred years after the poet was 
born, it is a remarkable bit of treasure trove.

A national Dickens library is getting itself estab- 
lished in London, in the heat of the Dickens enthusiasm 
aroused by the ninety-fifth anniversary, last month, of 
the great novelist's birthday. A room in the Guildhall 
Library will be set apart for this collection, the nucleus 
of which has been already formed out of the first 
editions of all the novels, with noteworthy American 
and other reprints and translations, and miscellaneous 
Dickensiana of sundry sorts. The widow of the late 
F. G. Kitton, offers to the library his valuable Dickens 
collection for the moderate sum of £300, and sub-

scriptions for its purchase are solicited by the editor 
of "T. P.'s Weekly" (which itself gives £25) at 5 
Tavistock Street, W. C. A flourishing periodical, " The 
Dickensian," published once a week by the Dickens 
Fellowship, attests the English determination not to 
forget their immortal " Boz." At the same time, let it 
be gently hinted, there be those to whose delicate senses 
the air of a Thackeray Library would more sweetly 
recommend itself. But patience ! — 1911 is only four

The popularization of the best literature is to 
be attempted, with a display of childlike confidence 
that is nothing short of touching, by a new magazine, 
whose prospectus does not hesitate to declare that " the 
very highest class and most valuable branches of litera- 
ture can readily be made fully as interesting, attractive, 
and even fascinating to all classes, even to the morbid- 
minded and degenerate, as is now the prevailing 
low order of the great bulk of sensational, exciting, 
stirring so-called ' literature, ' so boimteously scat- 
tered broadcast in its corrupting and demoralizing 
blight upon mankind." One would like to know the 
magic formula for rendering, let us say, Matthew 
Arnold or John Ruskin as irresistible to the multitude 
as the latest murder mystery or sensational romance 
or lui'id detective story. We wait to learn this, but 
not, alas! in a spirit of confidence that is altogether 

childlike.

The death of « Th. Bentzon," or Mme. Th^r^se 
de Solms Blanc, as her friends knew her, will be noted 
with regret by many outside her native France, and 
especially by her American readers. Always friendly 
toward this coimtry and its literary workers, she has 
published, chiefly in the pages of the Revue des Deux 
Mondes, many commendatory reviews of American 
books, eulogistic studies of American authors, and 
pleasant reminiscences of American travel. That she 
wrote also between thirty and forty novels comes as a 
surprise to most of us, who have commonly thought of 
her in connection with her more serious work, on which 
her fame as a writer will probably rest.

A Hebraization of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat 
has been undertaken by Mr. Joseph Massel of Man- 
chester, England; his version being based on Fitz- 
Gerald's first edition, by many considered the best of 
the four. These haunting quatrains seem to have, in 
some sort, an affinity with the "Wisdom books of the Old 
Testament, and a good Hebrew translation ought to 
prove, not perhaps the best-selling book in the Ghetto, 
but a tolerable literary success. Yet supposing the 
Hebrew version of FitzGerald's stanzas to be faithfully 
turned back into Persian, would old Omar know himself 
at the end of this lingual hocus-pocus ? 



COMMUNICA TION. 



ON READING THE MAGAZINES. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.J 
Few publishers of magazines seem to realize the 
frame of mind most people are in when they pick up a 
magazine. I say most people, because there are a few 
who read the magazines religiously, as they might read 
the Bible, regardless of comfort or convenience. But as 
a rule people take up a magazine at a time when they are 



enjoying a few moments of leisure which they wish to 
spend as pleasurably and comfortably as possible. A 
man may be leaning back in his seat on the train, smok- 
ing a cigar, and rejoicing that he is to have a short respite 
from the harassing cares of business ; or he maybe puffing 
his pipe beside a grate fire, mider a green-shaded lamp, 
relaxing cosily after a day's hard work, and taking up 
a magazine for diversion. I do not know so much about 
feminine ways, but I should fancy a woman might be 
reclining for her siesta, and open a magazine for a little 
mental relaxation and composure before she closes her 
eyes. 

Now I maintain that most of our magazines are not 
adapted to such a frame of mind. This is not because 
their contents are too serious, but simply because the 
magazines are so constructed mechanically that it is a 
physical effort to read them. In plain English, it tires 
the thumbs. Why do publishers put their magazines 
together so that they will not lie open on the lap? How 
is a man to smoke his pipe as he reads, when he must 
hold the magazine open by all the strength of both 
hands ? I know of only one or two magazines that are 
properly boimd with thread and glue, instead of those 
irritating wire clasps. No doubt the clasps are cheaper, 
or they would not be used. That is the explanation of 
most of the impositions on a long-suffering public. But 
I believe any magazine publisher could increase his 
circulation by abolishing the clasps. The other day I 
closed my subscription to a magazine I had taken for 
years, and ordered another in its place, chiefly for the 
reason that one would not lie open on the table and the 
other would. The wire clasps were a doubtful economy, 
surely, in that case. 

Another reason why many magazines are unsuitable 
for leisurely reading is that they are too heavy and 
bulky with advertisements. I am aware that there 
must be advertisements to make the magazine pay. I 
would even go further, and maintain that most of our 
magazines are conducted primarily in the interest of the 
advertising department, and that the literary matter is 
sandwiched in merely to get people to read the adver- 
tisements. But why in that case should this not unwor- 
thy commercial end be defeated by making the magazine 
so heavy and forbidding that not even the advertise- 
ments will be read ? Other things being at all equal, 
I always buy the magazines that contain the fewest 
advertisements. When I must read a magazine that is 
so thick with advertisements that I cannot hold it open, 
I tear off the cover, extract the wire clasps, detach the 
advertising pages in front and back, and tlien restore 
the clasps to their places. I thus have a light and 
easily handled collection of reading matter, while the 
detached pages make excellent material for starting 
fires in my grate. A handy mechanical device for per- 
forming this separation quickly and easily would find 
speedy favor with the magazine reading public ; indeed, 
1 should not be surprised to learn that one has already 
been invented. It would not be the first instance of 
greed over-reaching itself and defeating its own ends. 

With all their faults, the magazines of to-day contain 
a great deal of good literature. While there is much 
in them that is worthless or of merely temporary inter- 
est, there is also much of value, which intelligent people 
can ill afford to miss. Publishers certainly owe it to 
their readers, as well as to their own interests, to make 
the contents of their magazines as accessible and as 
conveniently read as possible. g p Delany

Home Impressions of an Expatriated 
American.* 



It was of course to be expected that Mr. 
Henry James, in recording his impressions of 
the land from which he long ago expatriated 
himself, and which he lately revisited after nearly 
twenty-five years, would give us not so much his 
direct impressions (supposing a mind so subtile 
to be capable of direct and simple impressions) 
as his impressions of his impressions, his con- 
ception of what, in the aesthetic and artistic 
fitness of things, his impressions ought to be, 
and occasionally a side-glance at those impres- 
sions as he conceives they may impress his 
reader, — all intertwisted and interwoven and 
wrought out in a pattern of that labyrinthine 
intricacy that is at once the despair and the 
delight of him who would thread the Daedalian 
mazes of this author's wonderful prose. Even 
as Mr. James drives from the wharf in New 
York, on landing, the extreme difficulty of the 
task before him presents itself as somewhat 
terrifying. 

" Yes ; I could remind myself, as I weut, that Naples, 
that Tangiers or Constantinople, has probably nothing 
braver to flaunt, and mingle with excited recognition 
the still finer throb of seeing in advance, seeing even to 
alarm, many of the responsibilities lying in wait for the 
habit of headlong critical or fanciful reaction, many of 
the inconsistencies in which it would probably have, at 
the best, more or less defiantly to drape itself. . . . 
Nothing was left, for the rest of the episode, but a kind 
of fluidity of appreciation — a mild, warm wave that 
broke over the succession of aspects and objects accord- 
ing to some odd inward rhythm, and often, no doubt, with 
a violence that there was little in the phenomena them- 
selves flagrantly to justify. It floated me, my wave, all 
that day and the next ; so that I still think tenderly — 
for the short backward view is already a distance with 
' tone ' — of the service it rendered me and the various 
perceptive penetrations, charming coves of still blue 
water, that carried me up into the subject, so to speak, 
and enabled me to step ashore." 

Already in the preface to " The American 
Scene ' the reader has been made aware of the 
writer's deep sense of the weighty responsibility 
resting on him as a recorder of impressions, and 
of his brave resolve to face the situation, formi- 
dable though it be, with a noble courage. 

" There would be a thousand matters — matters 
already the theme of prodigious reports and statistics — 
as to which I should have no sense whatever, and as to 
information about which my record would accordingly 
stand naked and unashamed. It shoidd unfailingly be

proved against me that my opportunity had found me 
incapable of information, incapable alike of receiving 
and of imparting it; for then, and then only, would it 
be clearly enough attested that I had cared and under- 
stood." 

Mr. James has been, as he says, all his days 
" artistically concerned with the human subject"; 
and hence it is his impressions of American men 
and women that form the most characteristic 
portion of his volume, and that furnish the best 
passages for quoting. Of our men and women 
in general he says : 

" No impression so promptly assaults the arriving 
visitor of the United States as that of the overwhelming 
preponderance, wherever he turns and twists, of the 
ifnmitigated ' business-man ' face, ranging through its 
various possibilities, its extraordinary actualities, of 
intensity. And I speak here of facial cast and expres- 
sion alone, leaving out of account the questions of voice, 
tone, utterance and attitude, the chorus of which would 
vastly swell the testimony, and in which I seem to dis- 
cern, for these remarks at large, a treasure of illus- 
tration to come. Nothing, meanwhile, is more concom- 
itantly striking than the fact that the women, over the 
land — allowing for every element of exception — - ap- 
pear to be of a markedly finer texture than the men, 
and that one of the liveliest signs of this difference is 
precisely in their less narrowly specialized, their less 
commercialized, distinctly more generalized, physiog- 
nomic character. The superiority thus noted, and 
which is quite another matter from the universal fact 
of the mere usual female femininity, is far from con- 
stituting absolute distinction, but it constitutes relative, 
and it is a circumstance at which interested observation 
snatches, from the first, with an immense sense of its 
portee." 

This distinction he regards as the feature of 
the social scene, and uncommonly fruitful of 
possibilities. In aU this there is cheer and hope 
for those who are inclined to deplore, as too 
obtrusively prevalent among us, the business- 
woman type, the new woman, and the bachelor 
maid. 

Any attempt to epitomize Mr. James, or to 
reproduce him in other than his own words, 
would be rashly presumptuous and inevitably 
imsuccessfid. This must be the excuse, if excuse 
were needed, for introducing another consider- 
able passage, one that was inspired by a visit 
to New York's Ghetto. The reader will bear 
in mind that no other city has so many of the 
children of Israel. He will not need to be told 
to admire the skill of the literary artist in the 
following word-picture : 

" There is no swarming like that of Israel when once 
Israel has got a start, and the scene here bristled, at 
every step, with the signs and sounds, immitigable, un- 
mistakable, of a Jewry that had burst all bounds. . . . 
It was as if we had been thus, in the crowded, hustled 
roadway where multiplication, multiplication of every- 
thing, was the dominant note, at the bottom of some 
vast sallow aquarium in which innumerable fish of over- 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

developed proboscis, were to bump together, forever, 
amid heaped spoils of the sea. The children swarmed 
above all — here was multiplication with a vengeance ; 
and the number of very old persons, of either sex, was 
almost equally remarkable; the very old persons being 
in equal vague occupation of the doorstep, pavement, 
curbstone, gutter, roadway, and every one alike using 
the street for overflow. . . . There are small, strange 
animals, known to natural history, snakes or worms, I 
believe, who, when cut into pieces, wriggle away con- 
tentedly and live in the snippet as completely as in the 
whole. So the denizens of the New York Ghetto, heaped 
as thick as the splinters on the table of a glass-blower, 
had each, like the fine glass particle, his or her indi- 
vidual share of the whole hard glitter of Israel." 

Of Baltimore, with its bone-rackiiig cobble- 
stone pavements, its alternate dust and mud, 
and its unsightly and unfragrant surface drain- 
age — an ensemble not attractive to most visitors, 
nor by any means inclining them to picture the 
city in retrospect as an " almost unnaturally 
good child " sitting " on the green apron of its 
nurse, with no concomitant crease or crumple " 
— the author, after some playful disparagement 
of the fine Washington monument, is moved to 
exclaim : 

" Wonderful little Baltimore, in which, whether when 
perched on a noble eminence or passing from one seat 
of the humanities, one seat of hospitality, to another — 
a process mainly consisting indeed, as it seemed to me, 
of prompt drives through romantic parks and wood- 
lands that were all suburban yet all Arcadian — I caught 
no glimpse of traffic, however mild, nor spied anything 
* tall ' at the end of any vista. This was in itself really 
a benediction, since I had nowhere, from the first, been 
infatuated with tallness; I was infatuated only with the 
question of manners, in their largest sense — to the finer 
essence of which tallness had already defined itself to 
me as positively abhorrent. . . . Admirable I found 
them, the Maryland boroughs, and so immediately dis- 
posed about the fortunate town, by parkside and lonely 
lane, by trackless hillside and tangled copse, that the 
depth of rural effect becomes at once bewildering. You 
wonder at the absent transitions, you look in vain for 
the shabby fringes — or at least, under my spell, I did ; 
you have never seen, on the lap of nature, so large a 
burden so neatly accommodated." 

No traffic however mild, no shabby fringes ! 
Surely, our traveller must have passed his time 
in grove-embowered villas in the city's most 
favored suburbs, if it has any such. Yet we 
learn from his own narrative that he did not do 
this. The best of health and spirits, then, must 
have been his during the Baltimore sojourn. 

The author's itinerary included, in an autumn 
and winter progress from New England to 
Florida, the intervening cities of Philadelphia, 
Washington, Richmond, and Charleston, be- 
sides New York and Baltimore. Boston, it need 
hardly be added, was not overlooked, nor were 
Concord and Salem and Newport, and other 
interesting parts of New England. The book is 



one to read in at length, if not to read through, 
and cannot be presented by the reviewer in a 
nutshell. Its pages are strewn with the happiest 
phrases and turns of expression. They teem 
with passages of exquisite artistry, which, with- 
out reference to the scenes and objects so deli- 
cately depicted, are a joy to the lover of the 
gracefidly elaborate, the subtilely expressive 
and still more subtilely suggestive, in English 
prose. Those readers whom the end of the vol- 
ume shall leave unsatisfied may take comfort in 
the concluding words of the preface, where the 
author says he has not found his subject-matter 
scant or simple, and intimates that there are still 
further chapters to be told ere his story is done 
— chapters, as he elsewhere hints, that shall 
deal with the Pacific coast, as these earlier ones 
have treated the Atlantic.

The Burneys in St. Martin's Street.* 



It is impossible not to agree with Miss Con- 
stance HiU, when she speaks, in the preface 
to her new book, " The House in St. Martin's 
Street," of the perennial interest that attaches 
to the letters — and she might have added, to 
the diaries — of the eighteenth century. It is 
this fact that gives validity to Miss Hill's rather 
slender excuse for writing another book about 
the Burney family, whose lively correspondence 
and voluminous journals, themselves easily acces- 
sible, have already been copiously drawn upon 
by present-day chroniclers. 

In " Juniper HaU " Miss Hill has already 
given a detailed account of one period in Fanny 
Bumey's life. The title of her new book limits 
its material to the events of the years between 
1774 and 1783, the period which the Burneys 
spent in the last of their several London 
residences. It was during this time that both 
" Evelina " and " Cecilia " were written, and 
that their girlish author was discovered and 
initiated into the charmed circle at whose centre 
sat Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson. Frequent 
journeys from London took Fanny Burney to 
Chessington to see her dearest friend " Daddy 
Crisp," and to Streatham and Bath to stay with 
her fond but decidedly exacting patroness Mrs. 
Thrale. Miss Hill does not consider it beyond 
her province to detail anecdotes of these visits, 
as well as of the musical and literary gatherings

in St. Martin's Street, the plottings over the 
secret publication of " Evelina " that went on 
there, and all the merry and not in the least 
momentous daily doings of the little circle whose 
private life was so famous for its harmony and 
serene happiness that somebody has called them 
the " most amiable and affectionate of clever 
families." 

For novelty of material Miss Hill depends 
upon a very complete description of the St. 
Martin's Street residence, and upon some un- 
published MSS., chiefly a diary kept by Char- 
lotte Burney through part of the year 1781, 
some letters of Susan to her favorite sister 
Fanny, and a few family letters from Mr. Crisp, 
Mrs. Thrale, and other friends. Most notable 
of all is the MS. of Fanny's unpublished play 
called " The Witlings," which is apparently 
newly available, since Mr. Austin Dobson had 
not seen it when he published his life of Miss 
Burney in 1903. None of these items is in itself 
of any particular importance. Together, and 
pieced out from the familiar sources — the 
" Early Diaries," Madame d'Arblay's " Diary 
and Letters," and her " Memoirs of Dr. Bur- 
ney," — they make the bS,sis for a decidedly 
entertaining narrative of over three hundred 
pages. 

The St. Martin's Street house is still stand- 
ing, and not altered beyond recognition. It is 
easy. Miss Hill tells us, to identify the drawing- 
room, though its " prodigiously painted and 
ornamented " ceiling, in which the Burneys 
gloried, has long since disappeared ; the library, 
which was also their music-room ; and the cheer- 
ful "dining parlour" where the delightfully 
informal tea-drinkings took place. Only the 
quaint observatory, once Sir Isaac Newton's 
study and later Fanny's favorite retreat, has 
vanished. Miss Ellen G. Hill has made many 
interesting sketches of the characteristic features 
of this house, and of other houses and scenes 
connected with the narrative. These, with vari- 
ous reproductions of portraits, form a valuable 
pictorial adjunct to the text. 

It is perhaps natural that a feminine chron- 
icler, and particularly one who has already 
given us a detailed account of Miss Burney's 
real romance, should make a good deal of the 
brief but persistent wooing of her earlier lover, 
Mr. Barlow. Miss HiU quotes from Fanny's 
journal for 1775, and from a letter sent her by 
the enamored gentleman ; and these leave no 
doubt in the reader's mind that Fanny's family 
had an exaggerated horror of her dying an " old 
maid," — for otherwise they surely would not 



have thought of urging her to consider a match 
so manifestly unsuitable. It was, however, small 
wondfer if Miss Burney found even the man of 
average talents without charm, when she com- 
pared him with Dr. Burney and his brilliant 
friends. Every one of these seems to have shown 
his best side to her. Even the gruff and iras- 
cible Dr. Johnson grows actually lamb-like when 
she appears, and treats her with an unfailing 
consideration that he showed to no one else. 
Fanny comments on this in a letter written in 
1782 to her father, while she was staying in 
Brighton with Mrs. Thrale. 

" Our dear Dr. Johnson keeps his health amazingly, 
and with me his good humor ; but to own the truth, with 
scarce anybody else. I am quite sorry to see how 
immercifully he attacks and riots people. He has raised 
such a general alarm that he is now omitted in all cards 
of invitation sent to the rest of us." 

But of all the visitors to St. Martin's street, 
Garrick was the favorite with the Burney sis- 
ters. A call from him sent them into raptures, 
and his friendship they justly considered a 
great honor. As Charlotte Burney, the youngest 
daughter, puts it, more forcibly than elegantly, 
in her journal, " /Split me if I'd not a hun- 
dred times rather be spoken to by Garrick in 
public than by His Majesty, God bless him ! " 

It was at the house of Garrick's genial friend 
Sir Joshua Reynolds that the subject of " The 
Witlings" was first broached. Sheridan was 
one of the guests, and, beginning by praising 
" Evelina," he insisted that its author ought to 
try her hand at a play. Reynolds heartily ap- 
proved the plan. So did Johnson, Mrs. Thrale, 
and the rest of Fanny's friends, when they 
heard of it, save only Mr. Crisp, who was 
doubtful if his " Fannikin " had the tempera- 
ment of a playwright, and who feared for her 
the results of a possible failure or a partial suc- 
cess. Six months later the play was finished 
and sent down to Chessington by Susan and 
Dr. Burney, with a request for an absolutely 
candid opinion. A letter from Susan tells how 
Dr. Burney read it aloud, to the great delight 
of his small audience. Nevertheless, both he 
and Mr. Crisp decided that in spite of its clever 
characterization and spirited dialogue the play 
would better be suppressed. Fanny, who always 
set the approval of her dearest friends far above 
the praise or blame of the public, did not ques- 
tion the judgment. She writes in gay good 
humor to Mr. Crisp, in answer to what she calls 
his "hissing, groaning, cat-calling epistle," a 
letter concluding thus : 

" I won't be mortified and I won't be downed; but I 
will be proud to find I have, out of my own family, as

well as in it, a friend who loves me well enough to 
speak the plain truth to me." 

Miss Hill prints the fourth act of the play, the 
one, according to Susan, which " seemed least 
to exhilarate, or interest, the audience." It is 
an amusing satire on the affectation of learning, 
so prevalent among the fine ladies of Fanny's 
day when learning itseK was in fashion. But 
it lacks plot interest and dramatic movement. 
We can doubtless estimate, far more easily than 
Fanny's contemporaries, the width of the chasm 
between the majestic progress of the " three 
volume romance " and the sprightly compact- 
ness of the stage comedy. Nevertheless, '- The 
Witlings " has, at the least, a documentary in- 
terest that fully justifies the lengthy citation. 

Dr. Johnson once complained that " the little 
Burney " would not " prattle," though he was 
sure that she could do it well. But she and all 
her family prattle without reserve on paper, 
and they justify the Doctor's suspicion by doing 
it extremely well, making us acquainted with 
themselves and their friends in phrases as artless 
as they are deft and telling. Susan's letters 
are as lively as possible, and Charlotte's frag- 
mentary journal reads as if it might have been 
written yesterday by some bright girl of twenty. 
" He is a genteel-looking man, and full of rattle 
— and I like rattles," she says of a certain very 
unpopular Captain Williamson. She repeats 
many epigrams and lively bits of repartee, calls 
Boswell " a sweet creature," apparently because 
he made a bon mot about her, and complains of 
a certain Mr. Humphrey on the very tenable 
ground that all he ever said to her was, " Pray 
how do all your brothers and sisters do?" 
Little touches like these give reality to the 
chronicle of the life that went on so merrily in 
St. Martin's Street. 

Miss Hill does not attempt criticism or inter- 
pretation. She acts merely in the capacity of 
showman, marshalling her documents and letting 
them tell their own story. Granted the limi- 
tations of her method and of her present oppor- 
tunity, she deserves nothing but praise for her 
conscientious and capable investigation of the 
resources at her command, and for her judicious 
selection and arrangement of her well-chosen 
material. Edith Kellogg Dunton.

Stirrixg Chapters of American 
History.* 



Two important additions have recently been 
made to American historical literature by writ- 
ers who are masters in their chosen fields. In 
his sixth volume Professor McMaster brings his 
" History of the People of the United States " 
from the accession of Andrew Jackson in 1829 
to the veto of the Whig Bank bills by Tyler in 
1841. In volumes six and seven Dr. Rhodes 
completes his monumental " History of the 
United States," which covers the period from 
1 85 to 1 8 7 7 . In these two works may be found 
perhaps the best accounts yet written of the 
developments of the American people from the 
close of the Revolutionary War to the restora- 
tion of home-rule in the Southern States. 

The object of Professor McMaster through- 
out his work has been to write the history of 
our people, and not simply that of a set of poli- 
ticians or even statesmen. If the present vol- 
ume seems to make a departure from this plan, 
since very little space is given to matters not 
connected directly or indirectly with politics, it 
finds its justification in the fact that the people 
were at last playing at the political game. The 
advent of Jackson, though neither preceded nor 
followed by any immediate and remarkable 
extension of the suffrage, is commonly looked 
upon as the real beginning of the democratiza- 
tion of the nation. Jackson came fresh from 
the democratic West, where the fight against 
savage foes and wild beasts for a home and sus- 
tenance in the forest left little room for the class 
distinctions and privileges which were charac- 
teristic of older societies. As the representative, 
the very embodiment, of such a democracy, it 
was altogether natural that he shoidd be on the 
lookout for everything which smacked of privi- 
lege. In his eyes, the National Bank was a star 
case of privilege battening on the people ; con- 
sequently he soimded a note of warning at this 
accession, though there was practically no com- 
plaint against the bank at that time. Nothing 
daunted at the general indifference, Jackson, 
ably seconded by Senator Benton, kept up the 
fight, first to arouse the people to a sense of 
wrong and then to right the wrong. In the end 
he compassed the destruction of the bank. The 
resulting derangement of the currency, and the

wild schemes of State banks, are matters of 
common historical knowledge. These facts are 
all set forth by Professor McMaster in an enter- 
taining manner ; but in speaking of the work of 
destruction, he follows the not uncommon habit 
of using a slightly misleading term when he 
speaks of "removing the deposits" instead of 
"ceasing to make deposits." Though not so 
replete with dramatic interest as the story of 
wild-cat banking in Michigan, the banking 
experience of Florida, at that time practically 
new territory and a sort of ward of the nation, 
certainly is deserving of notice, though it re- 
ceives none. In addition to numerous small 
banks, three were chartered with large capital 
stock. There being no money in the territory 
with which to pay for the stock, the device was 
hit upon of borrowing the capital by the sale 
of bonds. The Territory itself issued three 
millions of dollars of bonds for the Union Bank 
at Tallahassee, where the population within its 
reach probably did not exceed fifteen thousand 
whites and blacks, and guaranteed the bonds of 
two other banks to the extent of nine hundred 
thousand dollars. The laws tmder which these 
schemes were put through attracted little atten- 
tion at Washington until the banks were on the 
road to ruin and the bondholders were getting 
uneasy. A few of the bonds were redeemed by 
the banks, but many of them were left outstand- 
ing, and for these the Territory refused to pro- 
vide payment. 

In dealing with the question of Nullification, 
it is doubtfid if Professor McMaster has laid 
sufficient emphasis on the personal equation in 
the matter. Jackson hated Calhoun, and there- 
fore Nrdlification in South Carolina was treason. 
On the abstract question of States' Rights, it 
would be hard to say just where Jackson stood. 
His attitude toward the bank was the natural 
one of the particidarist ; in the matter of the 
Indians he stood complacently by and saw a 
State nullify a decree of the Federal Supreme 
Court. In neither case, however, was he stand- 
ing for any abstract principle, but simply for 
what he believed to be right in each case. The 
bank charter he believed unconstitutional ; he 
had fought too many» Indians to have much 
sympathy with them. The tariff was a different 
matter. While not at heart a high-tariff man, 
he believed the tariff act constitutional and that 
his arch-enemy Calhoun was at the bottom of 
the effort to nidlify it. 

One of the most interesting things brought 
out by the author in this connection is the atti- 
tude of Virginia which foreshadowed her later 



division. Naturally, South Carolina was de- 
sirous to know the attitude of her sister states. 
In Virginia, it seems, the most that could be 
counted on was the neutrality of the eastern 
section, while the western section was sure to 
stand by the nation. Even more striking is a 
letter written by Jackson to Buchanan, explain- 
ing how he had consigned " nullification and 
the doctrine of secession " to the tomb from 
which they would never rise again. 

It seems now like an anachronism to read of 
a movement in the United States, as late as the 
fourth decade of the nineteenth century, to abo- 
lish imprisonment for debt, or to wipe out 
feudalism as preserved in New York in certain 
remnants of the patroon system. Abolitionism, 
suppression of the right of petition, immigra- 
tion, and other social and economic questions, 
receive due attention. Strange to say, how- 
ever, certain anti-democratic tendencies in this 
age of democratization receive no notice what- 
ever. Some of the states began to lay restric- 
tions on the right of suffrage. North Carolina 
and Pennsylvania disfranchising free negroes 
about the same time. 

The present volume announces that the series 
is to close with one more. If so. Professor 
McMaster will cover more years than he has 
done in any previous volume, and that, too, in 
a period more stormy and significant than some 
of those ah'eady covered. The politics of the 
period are ample enough for extended treat- 
ment, and the social conditions will demand 
much f idler treatment than is given to this sub- 
ject in the present volume. A really great 
opportunity lies before the author, though he 
will be covering in part a period already well 
handled by Dr. Rhodes, and it is to be hoped 
that he wil not cramp himself by too narrow 
limitations in space. If two volumes are ne- 
cessary, let us have them. 

Giving up a promising business career and 
devoting oneself to the writing of history is an 
occurrence not common in this so-called com- 
mercial age. Such, in brief, has been the life 
of Dr. James Ford Rhodes, who has devoted 
nineteen years of the best part of his life to a 
period of our history but little more extended 
in time. The loss to the business world has 
been one of immense gain to the world of his- 
torical literature. The word " literature " is 
used designedly here. Possibly Dr. Rhodes's 
works may not stand a rigid application of all 
the tests invented by the schoolmen to deter- 
mine what is literature, but they certainly carry

the stamp of verisimilitude and have the force 
necessary to Im-e the reader on and invite him 
to return. Whether describing the scattering 
of fresh firebrands by the repeal of the Mis- 
souri Compromise, or depicting social condi- 
tions in the fifties, bringing into vivid play once 
more those tumultuous emotions which swept 
n^en hither and thither in the closing days of 
one administration and the beginning of another, 
or setting the stage for the fidl tragedy of the 
Civil War, there is in all and over all the deep 
breath of human interest. 

" Sordid " and " mean " are terms that have 
been applied in contempt to American history. 
The blunder-crime of secession was atoned for 
with a mighty effusion of human blood ; but it 
gave to the world examples of heroic daring, 
patriotic devotion, and pathetic seK-sacrifice, of 
statesmanship and military genius, that have 
seldom if ever been surpassed, and, last of all, 
freedom to a branch of the human race. There 
was nothing sordid or mean here. 

But the aftermath of war, that blunder-crime 
against civilization strangely misnamed Recon- 
struction, — was that not sordid and mean ? The 
answer may be found in the last two volumes 
of Dr. Rhodes's history. Not that he has at- 
tempted to reveal the base, — rather that, in 
his fidelity to the truth, he has been unable to 
conceal it. Seldom in all history has a nation 
been confronted with such momentous problems 
and presented with such magnificent possibilities 
in their solution, and more seldom still do we 
find a more miserable failure. Statesmanship 
seems to have died, and selfish political parti- 
sanship at once arose from the corpse. The 
generals of the army had bound up the wounds 
of the prostrate foe ; the politicians opened them 
again and bound them up with vitriol. The 
measures for the re-making of the Union appear 
to have been conceived in hate and born in a 
lust for pelf and power. The really great op- 
portunity which lay before Congress was to fit 
the wards of the nation, the freedmen, for citi- 
zenship, and to help them in adjusting their 
relations with their former masters. Instead of 
doing this they thrust the ballot into the negro's 
hand and turned him and the carpet-bagger 
loose for one of the most shameless orgies of 
political plunder the world has ever seen. Great 
as was the injustice to the intelligent and 
property-owning classes of the South, it was 
perhaps even greater to the negro. This is an 
age of democracy ; at first blush the enfran- 
chisement of the negro might seem to have been 
a part of this movement. The injustice to him 



came not simply in leaving him in the hands of 
designing men, but in actually forcing him to 
look to them for guidance. Wickedness and 
barbarism cannot rule forever over virtue and 
intelligence. The ten years' orgy had created 
a distrust of the negro, and when his rule was 
overthrown he was thrust under foot as unworthy 
of political rights. And now, forty years after 
his nominal enfranchisement, he must begin at 
the bottom and first prove himself worthy of 
these rights. 

Shameless misgovernment in the South re- 
acted upon the whole country and contaminated 
public life everywhere. If some of the Northern 
politicians were above the carpet-baggers in 
order of ability, they were not a whit better in 
point of morality. Concerning Benjamin F. 
Butler, Dr. Rhodes quotes with approval Weed's 
estimate that he was the most influential man 
in Congress (1873), and the worst. One of the 
strangest things in all our history is that the 
intelligent and virtuous state of Massachusetts 
should have honored this man so often and so 
highly. His love of pelf and power has been 
pointed out by Dr. Rhodes in previous volumes. 
Why speak of Oakes Ames and the Credit 
Mobilier, of Babcock and the Whiskey Ring, 
and of Belknap and the Indian-trade frauds, the 
last two of whom were protected by President 
Grant ? After reading the complete exposure 
of the character of Blaine, one shudders to think 
how narrowly he missed the Presidency twenty 
years later. Summing up the story of shame, 
Dr. Rhodes says : " The high- water mark of 
corruption in national affairs was reached dur- 
ing Grant's two administrations." Grant him- 
self is cleared of all personal guilt, in spite of 
Butler's boast that he had a hold over him ; but 
his career as President has beclouded somewhat 
the glory won by the sword. The notorious 
Tweed Ring had no official connection with 
national corruption, but the story of its riot 
and ruin is given as a part of the corruption of 
the age. 

In connection with the Tweed exposure. Dr. 
Rhodes makes a most interesting digression on 
the suffrage. Tweed had maintained himself 
by the vote of ignorant men who had no ma- 
terial interest in the community. The way to 
prevent such corruption, says Dr. Rhodes, is 
to restrict the suffrage by educational and prop- 
erty tests. But no such restriction was put 
in the New York charter, because at that time 
" the country was bowed down in adoration of 
the theory that voting was a right, not a priv- 
ilege." The author thinks that possibly all 



182

[March 16, 



men should be allowed to vote for President 
and members of Congress, but that state and 
city government is more distinctly a matter of 
business, and in these the rule of an intelligent 
minority is preferable to that of an unintelligent 
democracy. It is not surprising that one who 
has spent a long time in the study of this 
period should turn from it with his confidence 
in democracy shaken. Rightly understood, how- 
ever, it only emphasizes the truth that democ- 
racy must base its hope of ultimate success on 
intelligence and virtue. 

The character of Tilden suffers slightly at 
the hands of Dr. Rhodes. There was no taint 
of corruption, not even to secure the Presidency 
in 1877 ; on the contrary, he was honest, be- 
cause honesty is the best policy, though he did 
dodge the income-tax, but he was lacking in the 
physical and moral courage necessary for lead- 
ership in turbulent times and so vacillating of 
purpose as to destroy his party's enthusiasm. 
As for Hayes, " left to himself, he would have 
been capable of refusing the high office if not 
honestly obtained, and had he declined to ac- 
cept it before the Louisana Retuming-Board 
made their return, though he would never have 
been President, he would have been one of the 
world's heroes. As it actually turned out, hpw- 
ever, he saw with Sherman's eyes, which were 
those of a stubborn partisan." It is the author's 
opinion that " he ought to have stopped the 
action in his favor of the Louisiana Returning- 
Board, but after swallowing this much he stood 
as the avowed representative of his party ; and 
... he had no choice but to take the place." 
From this the reader will infer at once that Dr. 
Rhodes does not think that Hayes was elected. 
He says expressly that Tilden should have 
had the vote of Louisiana and possibly that 
of Florida. His account of this memorable 
contest is clear and remarkably well condensed, 
though it does not appear to add anything new. 
However, it is not likely that anything new will 
be added luitil someone investigates thoroughly 
the frauds at their sources, if it can be done at 
this late day. 

A few years ago, in an article published else- 
where, the present writer, quoting Professor 
Burgess's statement that the " final " history of 
the Civil War would have to be written by a 
Northern man, because the North was in the 
right and because the victor is always more 
generous than the vanquished, undertook to 
say that for this very reason the " final " history 
of Reconstruction would have to be written by 
a Southern man because the South was the 



ultimate victor in that life-and-death struggle. 
The recent achievement of Dr. Rhodes seems 
to indicate that the writer may prove a false 
prophet. Several Southern men have produced 
excellent monographs on this subject, but the 
man who surpasses him will accomplish a note- 
worthy feat. However, in dealing with these 
two periods there is this difference, which gives 
the Southern man no advantage: Men may 
stiU debate about the war and its causes, but 
there is only one side to Reconstruction. Here 
the vanquished, the inventors and supporters of 
Congressional Reconstruction, are universally 
condemned and cast into outer darkness.

The liETTERS OF Owen Meredith.* 

"My estimate of what Lord L3i;ton's rank 
will be is that, as a lyric poet, the position given 
him will be next among his contemporaries after 
Tennyson, Swinburne, and Rossetti." So wrote 
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt in 1892. To a generation 
that knows Owen Meredith only as the author 
of " Lucile," this estimate is sufficiently sur- 
prising. We are not concerned at the moment, 
however, to attack or to confirm it, but only to 
gain, if possible, an accurate impression of the 
man himseK from the two volumes of his 
" Personal and Literary Letters " now before 
us. They contain a record of unusual inter- 
est, — the story of a defeated poet, an exquisite 
amateur of letters, whom circumstances and 
temperament kept on the lower slopes of 
Parnassus. They convince us, not that Lord 
Lytton's public career prevented him from 
becoming a great poet, but that his success as 
diplomatist and administrator was possible be- 
cause his poetic inspiration, though genuine, was 
fitful and limited. He recognized this quite 
clearly himself. " I have at least half a dozen 
different persons in me," he wrote in 1890, 
" each utterly imlike the other — all pidling 
different ways and continually getting in each 
other's way " (vol. ii., p. 395). And in a more 
serious vein, he wrote to his daughter a few 
months before his death: 

" I reflect that if I had acted more selfishly — I don't 
mean in the bad but the best sense of the word, with 
more of that self-assertion which springs from a man's 
confidence in the best of his own nature, and is the dis- 
tinguishing mark of genius -=— I should have resolutely

eschewed a number of good things not suitable to my 
nature, and should have bent the circumstances of my 
life into conformity with the natural direction of the 
faculties best fitted to render life fruitful. In my 
inability to do this I recognize the absence of that mis- 
sion without which the imaginative faculty is a will-'o- 
the-wisp " (ii., 426). 

This letter is in pathetic contrast with one 
written to his father in 1854, when he was 
twenty-two years old, and had been for four 
years following the profession of diplomacy 
which his father had marked out for him. 

" I certainly feel and own that I have hitherto not 
done justice to myself in the profession, and I see 
many men getting before me to the top of the ladder 
whom I really feel to be not more light of foot or 
steady of hand than myself, so that if I continue to 
follow the career, certainly my amour propre is con- 
cerned in advancement; but I feel that all those great 
and brilliant prizes which allure others, would, even 
were I to obtain them, greatly diminish rather than 
increase my happiness: each step forward would be a 
step further from my own ideal, and would have to 
be trodden over some relinquished dream, or some 
strangled interest. . . . Even Uncle Henry, despite his 
many noble achievements and his costly successes, and 
his great position and reputation, the praise of the 
public press, the confidence of ministers, the envy of all 
his colleagues, and the Grand Cross of the Bath, is an 
example that makes me shudder. I would rather, for 
my part, have been Burns at the Scotch alehouse, than 
Uncle Harry in a ship of war, going out to his post 
Mdth the red ribbon on. As I once said to you when 
we walked along the streets of London by night, and 
you made me proud and happy by asking me the ques- 
tion, my ambition has ever been for fame rather than 
power. ... I have no fear myself of becoming a mere 
literary dilettante " (i., 59). 

This youthful prophecy was fulfilled. The 
" great and brilliant prizes " which he obtained 

— the viceroyalty of India, the Paris embassy 

— did not, if we may trust these letters, bring 
him happiness. Political activity was so far 
from absorbing him that it never really com- 
manded his respect. " The debates of the House 
of Lords," on his return from India, " appeared 
to him 'dreamlike and devoid of real life'; 
those of the House of Commons, ' one vast in- 
sane display of wasted power and passion mis- 
applied ' " (ii., 232). He would certainly have 
accepted John Morley's characterization of 
politics, widely as his political views differed 
from those of the distinguished Liberal : " Poli- 
tics are a field where action is one long second- 
best, and where the choice constantly lies 
between two blunders." 

On the other hand, Lord Lytton was, in the 
strict sense, " a mere literary dilettante " all his 
days. And this he himself early recognized. 
Writing to Mrs. Browning when he was twenty- 
four, he said : 



" ' Art requires the whole man.' Ah, how well I know 
that ! how bitterly I feel it. But why do you say it to 
me who am doomed to be a Dilettante for life ? If 
there is a word of truth in what we are always saying, 
and admitting when said, about the dignity of poetry 
as an art, its high tax on the faculties of the poet, and 
its sublime benefits to mankind, why in Heaven's name 
should we say that the devotion of the poet to his art, 
seriously, earnestly, exclusively ... as a profession 
and a most honorable one, is a waste of time ... a 
sleep in a garden of roses ? " (i., 80). 

This last is an allusion to a warning received 
from his father two years before. And to his 
father he wrote in 1860 : 

" There can be no doubt about real genius. It is sure 
of the world, and the world is sure of it. And this is 
what dismays me on my own account. I am too clever, 
at least have too great a sympathy with intellect, to be 
quite content to eat the fruit of the earth as an ordi- 
nary young man, and yet not clever enough to be ever 
a great man, so that I remain like Mahomet's coffin 
suspended between heaven and earth, missing the hap- 
piness of both. ... A little more or a little less of 
whatever ability I inherit from you would have made 
me a complete and more cheerful man" (ii., 82). 

There is the formula of dilettantism, of that 
gifted mediocrity which lacks the final efficiency 
without which the gTcatest gifts are sterile. 

His father had long before warned him of 
the danger that besets a young man of fortune, 
good looks, and popularity ; but by dilettantism 
the elder Lytton meant " writing only what 
pleases yourself," instead of writing with an eye 
single to popular approval. In fact, the suc- 
cessful novelist's admonitions to the young poet 
are an amusing compoimd of admirable good 
sense and crass Philistinism. 

" One thing I would say, in spite of all you urge about 
being content with a small audience and your own ap- 
proval. That is not the right ambition of a poet who 
means to influence his age. It is not worth the sacrifice 
of all other thought and career for. He should aspire 
to reach a wide public. This is one reason why I de- 
plore the paramount effect that poets who only please 
a few have on your line and manner. Praised as they 
are by critics, Keats and Shelley are very little read by 
the public, and absolutely unknown out of England. 
. . . Now take Charles Mackay's poems. They are 
little praised' by critics, no idols of the refining few, but 
they sell immensely with the multitude — it is worth 
studying why " (i., 55). 

Though this is contemptible enough, many of 
the elder Lytton's criticisms of his son's work 
are thoroughly sound. He pointed out the re- 
dundance and decoration, the absence of " mas- 
culine severity of taste," the fondness for detail 
rather than proportion, that characterized the 
young poet's work, at the same time admitting 
its genius. He thought, however, rather too well 
of " Lucile." " I can remember no work of such 
promise since Werter. ... At times the play 



184

[March 16, 



of the vocabulary reminds me of Goethe himself 
in his best days of poetry. You may rely on 
fame for the poem " (i., 99). The author's 
own view of it, we may say in passing, was more 
just. " A trashy poem that seems to have be- 
come very popular in America " (i., 93) was his 
best word for it. 

One aspect of the father's relation to the son, 
however, is less amusing than painful. From 
his boyhood, the younger Lytton's craving for 
his father's love and respect is almost pathetic. 
At the age of eighteen he wrote : 

" I have just heard from my father. What an m- 
tense pleasure it gives me to receive a letter of kind- 
ness from him, I cannot tell you. My position and my 
feelings are so strange, my heart is so full of love for 
him, full to overflowing, but it is darkened and choked 
vtith the most fearful and constant doubts, the most 
painful suspicions, the most bitter feelings " (i., 24). 

This is an allusion to the estrangement be- 
tween his father and mother, and the jealousy 
and distrust with which each viewed the son's 
intercourse with the other. At a later period, 
the yoimg poet's desire for his father's literary 
approval was no less keen thail his craving for 
his father's love. In reply to the elder Lytton's 
praise of " Clytenmestra," he wrote : 

" The best thanks I can give you back, my beloved 
father, for the great heartful of gladness you have 
given me must be the assurance of that gladness, and 
how it surpasses all other kinds of happiness, so that I 
could wish that my life should stop here lest anything 
less should follow. . . . My heart seems to open under 
each kind word of yours ; all things seem easy to do, 
and pain even light to bear " (i., 54). 

Yet the father to whom these words were ad- 
dressed was capable of writing a letter that con- 
victs him of cruel suspicion, if not of unnatural 
jealousy. 

" I don't think, whatever your merit, the world would 
allow two of the same name to have both a permanent 
reputation in literature. You would soon come to 
grudge me my life, and feel a guilty thrill every time I 
was ill. . . . No. Stick close to your profession, take 
every occasion to rise in it, plenty of time is left to culti- 
vate the mind and write verse or prose at due intervals. 
As to your allowance, I should never increase it till you 
get a step. I help the man who helps himself " (i., 60) . 

To this the son replied: 

" What you have said is quite enough. I shall only 
recur in thought to those suggestions for the future with 
reg^-et that they were ever made. I renounce them. . . . 
I am quite willing to abide in the profession and work 
as well and as cheerfully as I can in it" (i., 61). 

But this was followed by a still more amazing 
renunciation. At his father's request he prom- 
ised not to write ab all for two years. Possibly 
the son's poetical career, his incurable dilet- 
tantism, justify the father's severity. But for 
all that, it was a rash and heartless way to deal 



with a young poet. Suppose someone had 
silenced Keats for two years ! The supposition 
is, of course, absurd ; for Keats could not have 
been silenced. This act of obedience is suffi- 
cient evidence of the slightness of the poet's 
gift. For such a nature, it would probably 
have been the part of wisdom to put into his 
profession the spirit and energy that were in- 
sufficient for his art, and to cease to look with 
longing at heights which he could not climb. 
In middle life, he apparently came roimd to 
his father's opinion that the poet is not injured 
but improved by being combined with the man 
of afPairs, though the following letter, in which 
he expresses this conviction, must be contrasted 
with the one already quoted in which he lament- 
ed that his poetical aim had not been single : 

" For any man of robust moral fibre and unlimited 
intellectual receptivity, I am convinced that occasional 
close contact with (or immersion in) the central move- 
ment of that world, mean and shallow though it be, is 
essential, not perhaps to the development, but to the 
adjustment of his faculties. My belief is that all 
flrst-class genius has in it an element of vulgarity, 
if you will — but certainly of amalgamation with the 
common sense, and common experience and sentiment, 
of commonplace human beings — a fulcrum for its indi- 
viduality in what is generally appreciable. Shakespeare 
had it; Milton, too, in spite of all the narrowness of 
his sublimity; Dante, in spite of all his egotism; and 
Byron and Goethe and Voltaire — and this constitutes 
their immeasurable superiority in the hierarchy of 
genius over such geniuses as Keats and Shelley and 
Wordsworth and Tennyson and Rousseau " (i., 330). 

We have given so much attention to a single 
interesting phase of Lord Lytton's life that we 
have little space to devote to many other phases 
of perhaps greater intrinsic importance. The 
letters seem to us conclusive evidence of his 
diplomatic ability, and of the wisdom and 
tact of his Indian administration, complicated 
though it was by the perplexities of the Afghan 
War. The letters from India, indeed, are so 
full of color and incident, and throw so clear a 
light on the problems of colonial administration, 
that they surpass in interest and value those of 
any other period. On his return to England, 
it became necessary for him to take part in 
a debate of the Lords which was virtually a 
defense of the Government in its conduct of 
Afghan affairs. Lord Lytton never spoke 
readily, and had therefore carefully prepared 
his speech, when, within a few hours of deliver- 
ing it, Lord Beaconsfield begged him to change 
his line of argument. He writes : 

"There was a fidl House, the galleries thronged, 
royalties and peeresses who had staid in town to hear 
me ; the bar and the places behind the throne were also 
filled with Liberal M. P.'s and Ministers, who came up

from the Commons to hear me out of curiosity. I felt 
very nervous when I got up, and the cheers from my 
own side seemed to me rather faint. But after ten 
minutes I felt that I had the House well in hand, and 
when I sat down 1/elt that the speech had been a de- 
cided oratorical success. Lord Beaconsfield was un- 
stinted in his commendations of what he called its 
' remarkable Parliamentary tact.' The result was, 1 
think, a great relief to him, for his last words as he 
left the House with me were : ' You made a great effect 
without one injudicious word. As for myself, I feel as 
if I had won the Derby. I backed you heavily, and you 
have won my stakes for me — easily. As for you, you 
have established your own Parliamentary position in 
the front rank. From this time forward you may do 
or say anything you please in Parliament. Your posi- 
tion is assured, and you have won it by a single speech ' " 
(ii., 228). 

It is in the same letter that he remarks, " The 
more I see of public life in England, the less I 
like it, and the less I respect the actors in it" ! 

We can merely refer to the bits of literary 
criticism of his contemporaries — often sound 
and always suggestive — that are scattered up 
and down these volumes, and to the fragments 
of literary theory, which are as stimulating as 
those that delight us in the letters of Stevenson. 
We must also confine ourselves to mentioning 
the names of some of the distinguished persons 
to whom Lord Lytton wrote with the utmost 
freedom and intimacy, — John Morley, John 
Forster, Lord Salisbury, the Brownings, the 
Queen. 

So far as Lord Lytton's personality is con- 
cerned, we gain from these letters an impression 
of an unworldly and poetic capacity for friend- 
ship, of almost irresistible social gifts, of an 
entire sincerity of nature, utterly loyal and free 
from subterfuge, and beneath all the charm of 
manner and the gayety of the man of the world, a 
profound and permanent melancholy. He was 
evidently the most delightful and sympathetic 
of fathers, and his daughter writes of him with 
a mixture of the reverence due to his talents 
and position and the tenderness called forth by 
his fundamental imhappiness. In editing the 
letters, she has done her work with admirable 
reticence and skill. It is a far more touchinsr 
and mterestmg record than the biography of 
many a greater man.

Ix THE Land of Snow and Ice.* 



When the late Mr. William Zeigler's first 
expedition to the Polar region failed to attain 
any high degree of north latitude, he was not 
disheartened, but immeditely fitted out another 
expedition and sent it northward under the 
command of Mr. Anthony Fiala of Brooklyn. 
Mr. Fiala had been the photographer of the first 
expedition ; he had shown exceptional skill as 
an explorer, and had the experience necessary 
to overcome difficulties encountered by the first 
ill-fated party. Yet the well-laid schemes of 
both promoter and explorer went agley. Their 
vessel, "America," was crushed in the ice the 
first winter ; the unusual climatic conditions of 
the following summer prevented any serious 
advance toward the desired spot ; the relief ship 
failed to appear at the end of the summer ; and, 
finally, many of the men became disaffected, — 
a list of insurmountable difficulties which com- 
pelled the explorer to relinquish his efforts and 
to return without having achieved the object of 
his quest. 

In a minor way, however, the Fiala-Ziegler 
expedition was successful. Charts were made 
of previously unexplored portions of Franz 
Josef Archipelago, and magnetic and meteoro- 
logical observations were recorded by Messrs. 
W. J. Peters and R. W. Porter, the scientists 
of the expedition. The most important result 
of the expedition, however, is the publication 
of the account of it by Mr. Fiala. His book, 
" Fighting the Polar Ice," is doubtless the most 
interesting story of Polar exploration yet written 
in this country. Although it is the record of 
a failure, it is likely to be remembered longer 
than many accounts of more fortunate explorers. 

Mr. Fiala's expedition left Trondhjem, Nor- 
way, June 23, 1903, and on July 13 struck 
the ice-field in Barentz Sea. This sea, lying 
between Norway and Franz Josef Archipelago, 
has been crossed by many expeditions in less 
than a week's time, but it took Fiala's ship, the 
" America," over a month to buck and hammer 
its way to Cape Flora, the most southern point 
of the archipelago. On August 8, by almost 
miraculous good fortune, the ship escaped from 
the ice pack, " steaming between two enormous 
blocks of ice, and escaping just in time, as the 
fields crashed together with tremendous force 
behind us." On August 12 the expedition 
reached Cape Flora, famous in the annals of 
Polar exploration as the place where Jackson

and Nansen had their dramatic meeting, and, 
of vastly more importance to Fiala, where the 
Duke of the Abruzzi cached a gi'eat supply of 
provisions. Desiring to winter farther north, 
however, Commander Fiala set out to fight the 
ice of the British Channel toward Cape Dillon. 
After a sturdy contest, the expedition made 
anchor in Teplitz Bay, where the Duke of the 
Abruzzi wintered in 1899 and 1 900, and whence 
Captain Cagni of that expedition started on his 
trip nearest the pole of any explorer until Peary's 
recent achievement broke the record. 

From this time Fiala's account is a cata- 
logue of troubles. The " America," seemingly 
a " fatal and perfidious bark," broke loose from 
her moorings in a storm, and went adrift in the 
awful darkness of an Arctic night. Hardly had 
she been made fast again when she was locked 
in the ice, and was finally wrecked in the ice- 
pressure late in December. 

One little incident which lightens this dark 
story we may here transcribe. 

" The night of disaster was tinged with some flashes 
of humor, stories of which reached me later. While 
the crew were passing the bags over the side of the 
ship, the cook, who was of an excitable nature, suddenly 
appeared at the rail with a large bag which he heaved 
over with all his strength. It struck the ice below with 
a sounding crash; causing several of the sailors to 
exclaim, ' Hello, Cook, what was that? ' ' Oh, that 's all 
right! ' he answered; ' it' s lamp chimneys andjiat irons J " 

After the loss of the ship, the party had to 
accommodate itself to the house which had been 
built on shore at Camp Abruzzi. Then followed 
the long night of preparation for the trial fur- 
ther northward. On March 7, 1904, twenty- 
six men, with sixteen pony-sledges and thirteen 
dog-sledges, set out for the great North apex. 
In five days the party returned to camp, sorely 
tried in spirit, and with a chilled enthusiasm. 
Five men had become disabled, the cookers had 
proved inadequate, a snow-storm had proved 
too much for the party, and complaints were so 
general among the men that Fiala decided to 
return to camp to refit, and to reduce the num- 
ber of men for another attempt. 

This first attempt northward revealed the 
most serious defect in Fiala's appointments. 
Some of his men were of the stuff heroes are 
made of, but many of them were of conunoner 
clay and not fitted to endure the hardships of 
such rigorous work as Polar exploration de- 
mands. The author, who by no means has a 
complaining nature, fittingly says : 

" In Arctic research — as in all undertakings — 
Christian character is the chief desideratum. The 
Polar field is a great testing ground. Those who pass 
through winters of darkness and days of trial above 



the circle of ice know better than others the weakness 
of human nature and their own insufficiencies." 

Could Fiala have had a company of privates 
like his side companion, the Irishman Duffy, he 
might have accomplished more, even in the face 
of the difficulties offered by Nature. 

The second northward attempt was of even 
shorter duration than the first. The party left 
camp on March 25, reached Cape Fligely the 
same evening, but on account of disastrous ac- 
cidents to the sledges they returned on the 
second day. Out of thirty-nine men in camp, 
twenty-five elected to go south to Cape Flora 
to meet the relief ship. Again disappointment 
was to be theirs. Barentz Sea was dead and 
white, with a sullen sheet of rugged ice, so that 
no ship could come to the cape. All hopes of 
relief that year were soon abandoned. Provi- 
dentially, however, the lives of the party were 
saved by the abundant stores cached at Cape 
Flora by the Duke of the Abruzzi, and by the 
discovery of a vein of coal found up the steep 
talus. 

On September 27, Commander Fiala left 
Cape Flora to march north again to Camp 
Abruzzi. For fifty-four days Fiala and his heroic 
comrades staggered from ice-pack to ice-pack, 
from island to island, across the archipelago. 
It was on this awful return that he and Steward 
Spencer met with the most exciting adventure 
recorded in the book. While walking ahead of 
the sledges, the snow gave way beneath Fiala's 
feet, and with Spencer, who was trying to help 
him, he feU into a glacial crevasse, a distance 
of seventy feet, where the two were wedged into 
a narrow abyss. The story of the rescue is a 
thrilling one. 

" At last I saw above me the end of a rope, which 
gradually neared as I shouted directions to those out of 
sight above who were lowering the line, our only hope 
of escape. 

" My right arm was free, and at last the precious 
line was in my hand. I painfully made a bowline in the 
end of the rope, the fingers of my left hand being for- 
tunately free. Slipping the noose over my right foot, 
I called to those above to haul away. Soon I was swing- 
ing like a pendulum in free space. ... I called to them 
to move the rope to the right and then lower me. I 
swimg aroimd in the black chasm and felt the icy walls, 
but could not discover the Steward. 

" In desperation, as I felt myself growing weaker, I 
called to him, ' Look up and try to see me against the 
light above ! ' He obeyed, saw my suspended form, 
and directed my movements. In answer to my shouts, 
the men above moved the rope along the edge of the 
crevasse and lowered me to where I could reach the 
Steward, though I could not rescue him on account of 
a projection of ice that interfered. But I could pass him 
a foot and a hand, and lift him from his prone position, 
and help him to stand on the cake of ice that had broken

off when he fell and had jammed, saving him from 
death. Unable to give the Steward further help, I told 
him it woidd be best for the men to haul me up and 
send the rope down for him. He agreed, and I was 
drawn to the surface, — just in time, as I fainted on 
reaching the top. The Steward was hauled up next." 

Again in the fateful month of March, 1905, 
Fiala made his third trial, but reached only 
eighty-two degrees north latitude — his farthest 
point north. Although he thought it possible 
that he and Duffy might exceed Cagni's record, 
he felt that the party which had wintered at the 
South Camp might need his guidance in event 
that the relief ship failed to come the second 
year; so, sinking personal ambitions, he returned. 
On July 30, 1905, the relief ship was sighted. 

Although failure marked the attempt of Mr. 
Fiala to reach the North Pole, that word cannot 
be applied to his book. In many respects it is 
a most notable book of exploration. First of 
all, it is eminently readable : it does not cata- 
logue its author's heroic efforts, but it describes 
them with an imaginative fervor somewhat rare 
in books of this kind. Such sustained descrip- 
tive passages as his account of the grinding of 
the " America " in the ice, the long march of 
two hundred miles in the Arctic night from 
Camp Ziegler to Camp Abruzzi, and the story 
of the descent into the crevasse at Hooker Island, 
can hardly be matched among books of Polar 
exploration. Another feature that gives zest to 
this book is the author's photographs. No 
amount of reading can convey an idea of the 
terrible ice-packs, the tremendous ice-pressures, 
and the hummocks over which the sledges of 
Arctic explorers have to travel, so satisfactorily 
as do the panoramic pictures in this volume. 
Fiala's pictures reveal to us for the first time 
just what those difficulties are. The publishers 
of the excellent " Geographical Library " in 
which series this book appears, are to be con- 
gratulated on producing so picturesque and 
meritorious a volume. It will compare favorably 
with any book describing travel and exploration 
in the Polar region. H. E. Coblentz.

Life and 
manners of 
"the third 
Italy." 



The recent death of Giosub Carducci 
serves to remind us how much of the 
present literary revival in Italy is due 
to him. That very apt phrase "the third Italy" 
was coined by Carducci to convey the idea of a free 
Italy proceeding on her path toward happier desti- 
nies, in distinction from the first Italy which gave 
birth to the grandeur of ancient Rome, and the 
second Italy, overrun and subdued by barbarians, 



partitioned among strangers, or involved in inter- 
necine warfare. Books about the past of Italy are 
legion ; there are no lack of guides to her towns, 
her lovely landscapes, her art treasures. But now 
arises a new need — to watch the Italy that is now 
in the making, the Italy renewed and re-born in art, 
literature, statecraft, in every manifestation of men- 
tal life. Fortunately, almost the first attempt to 
supply this need is a very successful one. It comes 
in the shape of a handsome volume by Miss Helen 
Zimmern, bearing the title " Italy of the Italians " 
( Scribner) . The author's residence of twenty years 
in this land of her adoption has provided her with the 
adequate point of view ; her equipment as a scholar 
and writer on many subjects, artistic, philosophic, and 
literary, has given her a power of condensed gen- 
eralization which enables her to treat such subjects 
as "The Press," "Literature," "The Painters," 
" Sculpture and Architecture," " Science and Inven- 
tions," " Playhouses, Players and Plays," each in a 
single chapter. Some of these show how little we 
know of modern Italian life, and how easy it is for 
the casual tourist to be mistaken in his hasty deduc- 
tions. For example, we who are accustomed to 
bulky newspapers are likely to look with contempt 
upon Italy's small news sheet of four pages ; but 
scorn turns to praise when we learn of the wholesome 
editorial restrictions that govern the publication. 
No news calculated to disturb the world's peace is 
allowed to be manufactured in the office ; the polit- 
ical leaders are, as a rule, well-argued, well-studied, 
well-informed, and terse in expression ; the standard 
of literary and dramatic criticism is really elevated. 
The sanctity of the home is jealously respected. No 
marriages or births are announced in the Italian 
papers, only deaths. There are no interviews except 
such as concern politics, no man's house is described, 
no society ladies figure ; there is no lifting of the 
veils of privacy. A respectable Italian would be 
pained and scandalized if the picture of his wife or 
mother or sister occupied a full page in a public 
journal. The stock phrase with which the tourist 
comes to Italy, "There is no modern Italian art," 
is also effectually sUenced by a succinct survey 
showing the existence of an active and noteworthy 
Italian art, especially in landscape, where the old 
art was weakest. That so many " Old Masters " 
are continually being made proves the skill, if not 
the honesty, of the modern painter. Some of these 
are so splendidly executed, so exactly reproduce the 
spirit and character of the time and the artist whose 
title they assume, that experts are continually de- 
ceived. The thirty-one full-page illustrations in Miss 
Zimmern's volume are up-to-date and some of them 
are entirely new, increasing the attractions of this 
highly interesting book.

philaiithropic, not to say heroic, life on two conti- 
nents ; but his diaries and correspondence are now 
for the first time published, in part at least, under 
the editorship of his daughter, Mrs. Laura E. Rich- 
ards, in an octavo of four hundred pages entitled 
" Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe " 
(Dana Estes & Co.), to which Mr. Frank B. San- 
born has contributed a short historical introduction 
on the Greek Revolution of 1821-30, and to which 
also Whittier's noble poem " The Hero " is appro- 
priately prefixed. This volume, with its sub-title 
" The Greek Revolution," its closing " End of Vol- 
ume I.," and its lack of index, seems to promise 
most hopefully a continuation of the work beyond 
the year 1832 at which it pauses. Better than any 
attempt of our own to characterize these interesting 
extracts from diaries and letters that breathe the 
energy and ardor of youthful hope and courage and 
self-devotion, is the final paragi'aph of Mr. San- 
born's introduction. " Every reader," he says, " must 
be impressed, as I have been, with the genius, re- 
source, good sense, and chivalry of this young Bos- 
tonian, in the varied and exacting services which 
he could render to the cause of liberty and philan- 
thropy in the eight years covered by these journals 
and letters. His diction is not always classical, 
his knowledge not always exact; but his head is 
clear and his heart in the right place, — his hands 
skilful always to do what is needful at the time. As 
Thoreau said of Osawatomie Brown, ' He would 
have left a Greek accent slanted the wrong way, 
and righted up a fallen man.' And the effect of the 
whole is that of a romance of knighthood." Mrs. 
Richards's prefatory and interspersed notes add no 
little to the value and completeness of the book as 
a detailed account of her father's eventful young 
manhood. A photogravure portrait of the youthful 
Howe, from the painting by Jane Stuart, daughter 
of Gilbert Stuart, faces the title-page. He was a 
strikingly handsome subject for any artist. 

Again under the auspices of Dr. 
Essays on Francis G. Peabody, who contributes 

an introduction. Professor Carl Hilty 
appeals to his English-speaking audience in a second 
" happiness " volume, — " The Steps of Life : Fur- 
ther Essays on Happiness" (Macmillan), trans- 
lated by the Rev. Melvin Brandow. These chapters 
from the pen, not of a professed religious teacher, 
but of " a spiritually-minded man of the world" — 
to use Laurence Oliphant's phrase, as quoted by 
Mr. Peabody — are in the vein of his earlier essays, 
but are (a glad surprise) even better and wiser and 
stronger. Professor Hilty teaches constitutional law 
in the University of Bern, but has a firm belief in 
truths of a more spiritual quality than those on 
the pages of the statute-book. A defender of the 
Christian faith in its fundamental principles, he has 
already proved himself an ethical and religious 
teacher of real helpfulness. The wrestling with 
sin, the bearing of sorrow, the pursuit of culture, 
the cultivation of charity and courage and a simple 



Christian faith — these are his steps leading up the 
arduous ladder of life. Many striking passages in 
his book evoke cordial assent, and some, equally 
striking, call forth the opposite. He affirms that 
" the most trustworthy friendships are those which 
have sprung from a previous enmity, or have been 
once (but not twice) broken off ; " also, that "women 
are in general more easy to understand than men "; 
and that " polyglot speech is, as a rule, a mark 
neither of genius nor of character." Like most 
writings on "the simple life" and allied themes, 
these pages are not free from reiteration ; but that 
is not always a blemish in hortatory discourse. The 
translation is smooth, but has a few unidiomatic 
or awkward expressions, and at least one slip in 
grammar. " Financial " is used for " pecuniary," 
"delusion" where "illusion" would have been 
better, " more easy " for the shorter and preferable 
" easier," and, in one instance, " they " (German 
man) where a passive construction would have been 
neater. 

A handful of ^^'^^^ ^^^ bright and eminently 
colored beads readable are most of the little essays 
loosely strung, j^ i^igg Katharine Burrill's " Loose 
Beads" (Dutton). Every-day matters, and some 
others, are treated with good sense, cheerful philos- 
ophy, and literary skill. The happy quotation and 
allusion are abundantly in evidence, and the fact 
that two of the chapters had already found favor 
with the readers of " Chambers's Journal" is a sort 
of recommendation for the entire volume. In her 
amusing paper on " Innocence and Ink," the writer 
takes occasion to say : " I am quite sm-e there are 
many days when gi'appling with a swarm of bees 
seems a light and easy task compared to grappling 
with words and sentences that refuse to swarm as 
you wish them to — that are ever incorrigibly wrong 
and will never never come right." But herwords and 
sentences, as a rule, marshal themselves in excellent 
order, although a fussy critic might object to her 
split infinitives, her " as if there was," her " moirS 
antique " (with its superfluous accent), her indis- 
criminate use of "nice," her Scottish shyness (she 
declares herself a Scotchwoman, else we should have 
written "her skittish shyness") of "shall" and 
" should," and other peccadilloes that need trouble 
only the purist. The book is most attractively 
printed and bound.

glow " pass into oblivion. But behind the mask 
there is always a human being, and the lives of few 
women exhibit such vicissitudes as do those of 
actresses. The present author has given us sketches 
of a dozen women who in the eighteenth cenlhry 
attained to eminence in the only profession open to 
their sex. He points out that we are likely to form 
an erroneous estimate of the characters of those 
whose romantic careers form the subject of his vol- 
ume if we fail to bear in mind the gi-eat difference 
between the social positions of actors and actresses 
in the present day and their status in the eighteenth 
century ; they had then by no means emerged from 
the shadow of traditional classical and ecclesiastical 
degi"adation. Furthermore, these actresses had to 
encounter the tradition of immorality attaching to 
them in consequence of the notoriously scandalous 
lives of earlier English actresses in the profligate 
days of Charles II. The author has painted pictures 
of Charlotte Clarke, Margaret Woffington, Catherine 
Clive, Lavinia Fenton, Frances Abington, Dora 
Jordan, and their contemporaries, as they were, and 
left the reader to do his own moralizing wherever 
necessary. There is wit and genial humor and phi- 
losophy, with occasional cynicism, in these jottings, 
which are miscellaneous in character, — critical, 
biographical, anecdotal, descriptive, according to 
the mood or the circumstance. Eight photogravures 
embellish the volume. 



European "^^^ second volume of Mr. David J. 

international Hill's " History of European Diplo- 
relatwns. macy" (Longmans) brings his nar- 

rative down to the treaty of Westphalia in 1648. 
The period covered by the present volume marks 
the transition from the Middle Ages, with their 
almost chaotic political systems, to the modern 
period during which the permanent traditions of 
Europe took shape, national states succeeded to petty 
principalities, and modern diplomacy had its rise. 
In reality, Mr. Hill's work is not a history of diplo- 
macy as the title indicates, but a political history 
with special reference to European international 
relations during the period covered. Primarily, it 
is a review of the relations of France, Spain, Ger- 
many, and England to Italy, and particularly the 
long struggle of France and Germany for prepon- 
derance in the affairs of the Italian peninsula and 
the resulting effect upon the Papacy and upon 
European political morality. The ascendency of 
the House of Hapsburg, the international influence 
of the Reformation, and the development of the idea 
of a sovereign state system, are other topics treated 
by Mr. Hill. It may be doubted, however, whether 
they properly have a place in a history of diplomacy. 
The truth is that Mr. Hill has given us little on the 
subject of diplomacy during the period covered by 
his volume. We look in vain for any discussion of 
the methods and agencies of diplomatic intercourse 
during the Middle Ages, the rights and privileges 
of ambassadors, diplomatic usages, the conception 
and character of mediaeval diplomacy, and similar 



topics. As a history of Europe mainly from the 
point of view of international relations, Mr. Hill's 
work possesses conspicuous merits ; but it has only 
a very limited value for the student of diplomacy. 

The diversions of Piscator, Venator, and Auceps will 
an ex-President all tliree find entertainment and wise 
with rod and aun.^Q^J^^^l j^ ex-President Cleveland's 
collected papers entitled " Fishing and Shooting 
Sketches," which very appropriately bear the imprint 
of the Outing Publishing Co. The plain Viator also, 
if not strictly on business bent, will derive pleasure 
from these short and unpretentious chapters, writ- 
ten as they are in a humane and enlightened spirit, 
with an occasional touch of humor in its specific 
sense, and a delightful prevalence of good-humor 
throughout. A strong plea is made for out-door 
diversions in general, and for fishing and fowling 
in particular, with one brief chapter on rabbit-shoot- 
ing; and every page breathes a sturdy and manly 
(not to say gentlemanly) protest against unsports- 
manlike sport. The writer professes himself a 
warm friend to all members of the fish and game 
tribe, although so ardent in their pursuit. His 
book makes for the ennoblement of his favorite 
pastimes, and for their perpetuation. The illustrar 
tions, by Mr. Henry S. Watson, are numerous, ap- 
propriate, and daintily executed. A frontispiece 
photographic print of Mr. Cleveland, and also draw- 
ings of him in less formal attire, with rod in hand, 
add interest to this very inviting little volume. 

■The public ^^^ ^^^ ^^^ books that possess the 

addresses of charm, apart from their contents, of 
John Hay. thg recently published "Addresses 

of John Hay " (Century Co. ). The volume contains 
twenty-four addresses ; many of them are brief re- 
sponses to toasts, or remarks on other formal occa- 
sions, each containing an appropriate thought or 
sentiment finely worked out and gracefully phrased. 
But some of them are more elaborate productions. 
The one entitled " Franklin in France " is perhaps 
the finest, with its broad sweep over the historical 
conditions that produced the Revolution, and its 
presentation of the manner in which Franklin took 
advantage of those conditions to accomplish his mis- 
sion. Another elaborate address is that on President 
McKinley, delivered in the Capitol at the invitation 
of Congress. It is, as was to be expected, wholly 
laudatory, but the praise is not without discrimina- 
tion, and it is a noteworthy example of the formal 
eulogy. Others are " Fifty Years of the Republican 
Party," "America's Love of Peace," "The Press and 
Modern Progress," and " American Diplomacy." 

John Sherman ^he career of John Shernian was

seat in Congress he was in the public eye, and there

he remained for more than forty years. His in- 
fluence arose not so much from his oratory, though 
he spoke often and well, hut from his efficiency 
in doing things. There was hardly an important 
measure hefore Congress in all that time that he 
did not have a hand in shaping, and in much of the 
legislation he was the central figure. This con- 
spicuous career has been set forth by Congressman 
Theodore E. Burton in his volume on Sherman 
in the second series of "American Statesmen" 
(Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). The book is rather hard 
reading for the ordinary person who has no great 
liking for figures and financial history ; there was 
not much in Mr. Sherman's personality or career to 
give a biographer opportunity to enliven his book 
with anecdote or incident. But it gives a good 
account of a real statesman, and a history of several 
important phases of our national development during 
the last half centuiy. 

^ , , With the publication of volumes 

Twelve volumes ^ , 

of Lincoln's eleven and twelve we have m coni- 

works. pleted form the beautiful and com- 

prehensive " Gettysburg edition " of the " Complete 
Works of Abraham Lincoln" (Francis D. Tandy 
Company) . With its thorough gleaning of the writ- 
ings of Lincoln, adding one-fifth to the contents of 
the former edition, the essays, addresses, and poems 
about him, and the many fine portraits of him and 
the men of his period, it impresses us anew in its 
completed form as a work of great value for the 
student and the reader of our history and of litera- 
ture. Volume XL contains an address by James 
A. Garfield, the remainder of the writings down to 
the last hour of his life, with forty pages of new 
gleanings, and an elaborate and complete bibliogra- 
phy of Lincoln literature covering two hundred and 
forty pages made by Judge Daniel Fish of Minne- 
apolis. Volume XII. contains an anthology of Lin- 
coln's pithy sayings, a chronological index, and a 
general index covering more than two hundred pages. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Collected Works of Henrik Ibsen, " as edited 
(and in large measure translated) by Mr. William 
Archer, is in course of publication by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. There are to be eleven volumes in 
all, each with its special introduction. Four of the 
set are now at hand, and give us " Brand, " " The 
League of Youth, " " Pillars of Society, " " The Vik- 
ings, " " The Pretenders, " " A Doll's House, " and 
" Ghosts. " There are fourteen other plays for the re- 
mamuig seven volumes. 

An anthology of " Sea Songs and Ballads " has been 
made by Mr. Christopher Stone for the " Oxford Library 
of Prose and Poetry," published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 
The selections range from the earliest songs to Dibdin, 
and are largely chosen from sources not accessible to 
the casual reader. Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge contri- 
butes an interesting introduction to the book. — Another 
volume in the same series is a new edition of Cobbett'g 



" Enghsh Grammar," edited by Mr. H. L. Stephen. 
Although, as the editor points out, this work is now of 
interest mainly from a literary point of view, it still 
holds a certain reputation and authority of its own 
among grammars; and this prettily-made reprint is on 
all accounts to be welcomed. 

A study of the " Sources and Analogiies of ' The 
Flower and the Leaf,' " by Mr. George L. Marsh, is a 
doctoral dissertation prepared for the department of 
English in the University of Chicago. Taking for its 
starting-point the now fairly-settled assumption that 
the poem is not the work of Chaucer, the author of this 
monograph proceeds upon the theory that it was written 
by some imitator of the poet during the first half of 
the fifteenth century. The general conclusion is that 
the poem is an eclectic composition, to which both En- 
glish and French influences contributed. 

The day of Mendelssohn is pretty well past, but we 
may not grudge him a place in such a collection as the 
" Musicians' Library " of the Oliver Ditson Co. The 
volume of " Thirty Piano Compositions," now edited by 
Dr. Percy Goetschius, includes those writings of the 
class in question which have shown the greatest vitality 
— a group of the " Songs without Words," the Sonata 
in E major, the Rondo Capriccioso, and a score or more 
of other compositions. The collection has a preface by 
Mr. Daniel Gregory Mason, besides the usual portrait 
and bibliography. 

We are all loyally prejudiced in favor of any pro- 
noimcement from the venerable and amiable man of 
letters who has made American humor famous. It is 
with natural regret that one feels it necessary to record 
that Mark Twain's curiously tempered appraisal of 
Christian Science (Harper) adds nothing to the fame 
of the author. The colloquial and typically American 
admonition apropos of bibulous occasions that advises 
against the mixing of potations applies with due allow- 
ance to the mingling of caricature and sober attack. It 
makes it trying to determine under which mask the 
part is going forward. At all events, the story of the 
remarkable movement with which the book is con- 
cerned is receiving in these reportorial and historical 
days a sufficiently objective and circumstantial examina- 
tion to satisfy the most critically inquiring student of 
the future. 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page has now come to the dig- 
nity of " collected works." The Messrs. Scribner have 
brought together, m the twelve volumes of their " Plan- 
tation " edition (published by subscription) the various 
writings of this versatile and accomplished gentleman. 
We may be in substantial agreement with the publishers 
in saying that " Mr. Page has for twenty-five years rep- 
resented all that is best in the literature of the old 
South and the new." That period of a quarter-century 
is approximately what stretches between " Marse Chan " 
and " Gordon Keith," and the twelve volumes before 
us make a creditable showing of literary activity. Cer- 
tainly no one has written better short stories of old 
Virginia, and there is no better novel of the reconstruc- 
tion period than " Red Rock." That novel, and " Gor- 
don Keith,' fill each two volumes of the new edition, 
another gives us Mr. Page's essays on " The Old South," 
and still another of his poems. The remaining six are 
made up of short stories. The volumes are beautifully 
printed, and each of them contains three illustrations 
prmted in colors We trust that Mr. Page will live to 
give us another full dozen of volmnes.

Notes. 



A new volume by Joaquin Miller, consisting of a long 
narrative poem entitled "Light," will be published 
within a few weeks by Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. 

New and interesting material about Daniel O'Coimell 
will doiibtless be contained in his "Early Life and 
Journal," to be published in April by the Baker and 
Taylor Co. Mr. Arthur Houston, K. C, LL. D., edits 
the Journal, which has never before been published. 
There are several new stories of a humorous nature, an 
accoimt of O'Coimell's parentage, early education, read- 
ing and earnings at the Bar, etc. 

Dr. Horace Howard Furness is hard at work seeing 
through the press the fifteenth volume of his monu- 
mental " New Variorum Edition " of Shakespeare. The 
play treated in this volume will be " Antony and Cleo- 
patra," upon which Dr. Furness has devoted his entire 
time since the publication of his edition of "Love's 
Labour's Lost " more than two years ago. The J. B. 
Lippincott Company will probably have the book ready 
during the spring. 

The list of fine editions of foreign classics translated 
into English which the J. B. Lippincott Company has 
been issuing now includes ten titles, each title made up 
of from two to five volumes. The works included are 
Montesquieu's " Persian Letters," Margaret of Na- 
varre's " Heptameron," Cervantes' " Don Quixote " and 
" Exemplary Novels," Boccaccio's " Decameron," Rabe- 
lais' Works, Rousseau's " Confessions," Lesage's " Gil 
■ Bias," the "Arabian Nights," and Sainte-Beuve's Essays. 

The demise of " Temple Bar " brings regret, espe- 
cially to readers of the magazine in its earlier days, 
when Thackeray and Miss Braddon and other famous 
writers contributed to its entertaining pages. It was 
started in 1860, and has thus enjoyed a term of life 
far beyond the average of periodical ventures ; but of 
late its air and complexion have been sadly altered. 
And thus has fallen another victim to the too-triumph- 
ant ten-cent (or sixpenny) illustrated monthly magazine 
that stares us so unbashfully in the face on every 
news-stand. 

" Leading Americans " is the title of a new series of 
biographies announced by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., 
to appear under the general editorship of Professor 
W. P. Trent. The first volume, " Leading American 
Soldiers," by Mr. R. M* Johnston, is now ready; and 
among the future volumes arranged for are " Leading 
American Scientists " by Dr. David Starr Jordan, 
" Leading American Historians " by Professor William 
P. Trent, " Leadmg American Lawyers " by Mr. Henry 
C. Merwin, " Leading American Poets " by Dr. Curtis 
Hidden Page, and " Leading American Novelists " by 
Mr. John Erskine. 

Details are now announced of " The Student's Series 
of Historical and Comparative Grammars," edited by 
Joseph Wright, Professor of Comparative Philology in 
the University of Oxford. The object of this series is 
to furnish students interested in historical and com- 
parative grammar with handy voliunes on the subject. 
The General Editor has already secured the cooperation 
of the leading philologists in England, Germany, and 
America, and it is confidently expected that during the 
present year authors will have been secured for the 
whole series, consisting of about twenty-five volumes. 
The series will be printed at the Oxford University 
Press, and published by Mr. Henry Frowde.

The Magazine Reader's Friend 



TN each monthly issue of What's in the 
Magazines the contents, for the same 
month, of nearly one hundred leading peri- 
odicals are classified, indexed, described, and 
commented upon, — all in the simplest and 
most convenient way imaginable. It makes 
accessible to the busy every-day reader the 
entire mass of current periodical literature 
as it appears. Each issue presents a bird's- 
eye view of the magazines of the month, that 
will give one in five minutes the information 
hitherto to be obtained only by long and 
tedious examination of contents-pages on the 
news-stands. It is a periodical that brings 
the other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so 
must prove indispensable to everyone who 
would keep in touch with current affairs.

A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity. The 
multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years ?ias meant a serious embarassment 
to those who try to keep in toicch with current literature, and despair was heretofore the portion of 
the man who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced. As a handy guide to the things 
one needs or desires, What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest. 

— Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

The value of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will 
be rapidly appreciate by the student, the teacher, the specialist in any field of research, the general 
reader and the man of affairs. It is a publication that will admirably supplement '■'^Poole's Index " 
and the ^'Guide to Periodical Literature." — Detroit Evening News. 

So great is the reliance placed upon What 's in the Magazines that the busy man and woman 
wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and 
places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader. It is not, however, a 
msre list of contents, nor a complicated index, but each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine contents of the month. Its value to busy men and women is incalculable.

MOST REVOLUTIONARY 
BOOK EVER WRITTEN 

The Ego and His Own 

By MAX STIRNER 

Translated by STEVEN T. BYINGTON 

TTHIS book of 525 pages, now first published in English by 
*■ Benj. R. Tucker, originally appeared in Germany more than 
sixty years ago, but, as Dr. J. L. Walker says in his English 
introduction: "Fifty years sooner or later can make little 
difference in the case of a book so revolutionary." At first it 
created a tremendous furore, but it was so far in advance of its 
time that the interest subsided. The last decade, however, has 
witnessed a Stimer revival of no mean proportions ; biographies 
of the author have been written, and translations of the book 
have appeared in several languages. The purpose of the work 
is to destroy the idea of duty and assert the supremacy of the 
will. Lange, in his " History of Materialism," refers to it as 
" the extremest book we know," and Feuerbach characterizes 
the author as "the most ingenious and the freest writer within 
my knowledge."

THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH. 



When Lowell and Holmes and Whittier died 
in the early nineties, the most important chap- 
ter in the history of American literature was 
closed. They were the last of the elder poets 

— of the New England singers who had long 
held the national conscience in their keeping, 
with the grateful reverence of the younger gen- 
eration for their reward. But there were still 
poets left us — youngsters by comparison, 
although fast approaching the venerable term 

— and we felt that the torch was worthily borne 
by Stoddard and Stedman and Aldrich. Then 
Stoddard died, worn out with years, and now 
Aldrich has laid down his pen, and we have left 
us only one poet of large achievement to repre- 
sent the mid-century period which saw our 
nation in the throes of its deep agony and wit- 
nessed its great moral awakening. 

Thomas Bailey Aldrich was born November 
11, 1836, and died March 19, 1907. His sev- 
entieth birthday, in curiously exact coincidence 
with that of Henry Mills Alden, was cele- 
brated a few months ago, and gave his friends, 
known and unknown, the opportunity of paying 
him their tribute of admiration and affection. 
As one born in the thirties, he belonged to the 
decade of Edwin Booth and Bret Harte, of Mr. 
Stedman, Mr. Howells, and Mr. Clemens, with 
all of whom he was linked by personal intimacy. 
His boyhood began and ended in Portsmouth, 
with an intervening decade in New Orleans. 
When he was sixteen, his father's death cut 
short his plans for entering Harvard, and he 
started to earn his living as a banker's clerk in 
New York. But the literary instinct was too 
strong to be repressed, and he soon turned to 
editorial work for his support, with poetry for 
his avocation. He associated himself successively 
with several journals in New York and Boston, 
and in 1881 was called to the proudest editorial 
post in the country, becoming the successor of 
Mr. Howells as editor of the "Atlantic Monthly." 
For nine years he occupied the Park Street 
sanctum with its back window view of th& most 
peaceful spot in Boston — the Old Granary 
cemetery, whose occupants, as he used whim- 
sically to say to visitors, were highly satisfactory 
neighbors, because they never brought manu-

scripts for his inspection. Then, in 1890, he 
passed the blue pencil (symbolically speaking) 
on to Horace Scudder, and, made free from all 
sordid cares by the legacy of a generous friend, 
applied himself for his remaining years to the 
fine art of living. Youthful to the last, in both 
spirit and appearance, he looked at the world 
with Horatian eyes until just the other day, 
when the veil of death was drawn over them. 
Few of our writers have been as loved as he 
still fewer have left, as he has left, the 



was 



memory of the artist so closely interwoven with 
the memory of the rich personality. 

Delicate artistry was, indeed, the most char- 
acteristic mark of his work. One of his earlier 
poems recounts the things he would do if the 
soul of Herrick dwelt within him. They were 
the very things that he afterwards did, and not 
merely with the exquisite art of his exemplar, 
but also with an instinct for purity that puts to 
shame the amatory parson of Devonshire. Even 
more than of Herrick, however, does his work 
remind us of Landor, whose trick of epigram, 
burdened with a wistful pathos, he caught with 
extraordinary facility. 

" October turned my maple's leaves to gold; 
The most are gone now; here and there one lingers: 
Soon these will slip from out the twigs' weak hold, 
Like coins between a dying miser's fingers." 

What could be more Landorian than that? 
Only the image of the maple leaf marks it as a 
distinctive product of the New England soil 
from which the poet sprang. Yet this ' ' enamoured 
architect of airy rhyme," so delicate of fancy, 
so graceful of utterance, had also weighty mat- 
ters to disclose, and a weighty manner for their 
expression. He found, as so many other poets 
have done, in the sonnet the form most fit for 
his serious mood. Such sonnets as " Unguarded 
Gates," " Fredericksburg," and " By the Poto- 
mac " are the work of no lyrical trifler ; they 
are examples of the deepest thought and the 
noblest deliverance that our poetical literature 
can offer. 

In paying tribute to Aldrich the poet we must 
not forget Aldrich the prosateur. The latter 
aspect of his genius will hardly be left out of 
the reckoning by those who are old enough to 
remember the delightful surprise of " Marjorie 
Daw," and the piquant charm of " Prudence 
Palfrey " and " The Queen of Sheba," when 
thosQ inventions were first from the press. And 
where is the American boy, young or old, who 
ever read "The Story of a Bad Boy," and 
failed straightway to give it an abiding place in 
his affections ? It is a juvenile classic, if there 



ever was such a thing, having its place beside 
"Tom Brown at Rugby," "Treasure Island," 
and perhaps two or three others. And there 
are yet other volumes of choicely-fashioned prose, 
taking now the form of fiction, now the form of 
impressions de voyage. Nor must we forget 
the miniature prose tragedy of " Mercedes," 
effective both to read and to witness in per- 
formance. That work, and the blank verse 
" Judith of Bethulia," represent the author's 
contributions to the practicable drama, and 
gives evidence that he was both a playwright 
and a poet. 

It is to the poet that Aldrich was, however, 
that our thoughts turn first and last. He set 
for himself the highest possible artistic stand- 
ards, and came sufficiently near to their reali- 
zation to win laurels that will remain green as 
long as any feeling for beauty remains to us. 
He wrote little during his later years, the kindly 
muse heeding his prayer to her, 

" That I may not write verse when I am old." 
His own lines, representing a bearer's soliloquy 
at the funeral of a minor poet, may fittingly 
be drawn upon to close this brief tribute to his 
fragrant memory. 

«... Room in your heart for him, O Mother Earth, 
Who loved each flower, and leaf that made you fair. 
And sang your praise in verses manifold 
And delicate, with here and there a line 
From end to end in blossom like a bough 
The May breathes on, so rich it was. Some thought 
The workmanship more costly than the thing 
Moulded or carved, as in those ornaments 
Found at Mycenae. And yet Nature's self 
Works in this wise ; upon a blade of grass 
Or what small note she lends the woodland thrush, 
Lavishing endless patience. He was born 
Artist, not artisan, which some few saw 
And many dreamed not. As he wrote no odes 
When Croesus wedded or Maecenas died. 
And gave no breath to civic feasts and shows. 
He missed the glare that gilds more facile men — 
A twilight poet, groping quite alone, 
Belated, in a sphere where every nest 
Is emptied of its music and its wings." 



LITERATURE OF THE WESTERN 
FU R-TRA DE. 

Few things can be more gratifying to the patri- 
otic American or Canadian than the marked revival, 
within the last few years, of interest in the early 
records of the two countries. This interest is re- 
vealed not only in the readiness of the governments 
on both sides, federal, state, and provincial, to spend 
money for the preservation of national, archives, but 
still more strikingly in the increasing demand, all 
over the continent and from all classes of people,

for reprints of early narratives and the publication 
of manuscript material. Books that previously were 
to be found only in large public libraries, and were 
known only to a few historical students, are now in 
thousands of private libraries ; while many valuable 
manuscript journals have been edited and brought 
within the reach of everyone. 

In an age of artificial conditions, of stiff conven- 
tions, and of pride in material achievements, it is 
wholesome to turn back to these simple records of 
our pioneer forefathers, and correct our point of 
view in the light of their achievements. The broaden- 
ing influence upon public opinion of a wide reading 
of the narratives of men like Alexander Mackenzie, 
Jacques Cartier, Captain Cook, La Salle, David 
Thompson, Lewis and Clark, the two Henrys, and 
Zebulon Pike, can hardly be over-estimated. These 
men were not spotless heroes, but there is nmch in 
what they accomplished that was essentially heroic, 
and, what is greatly to the point, there is not a word 
in any of their narratives to suggest that they were 
conscious of this heroic quality. They did what was 
to be done with a singleness of purpose that one 
sometimes misses in the complex life of the present 
day. They were men of action, in the best sense of 
the term. They were pathfinders of a continent, to 
whom we owe much more than we are inclined to 
remember. The incentive that drew them to the 
path of discovery, a path beset by hunger and thirst, 
dangers and disappointments, was one that fortu- 
nately cannot be measured in coin. 

For many years the deep human interest of these 
records and narratives was unappreciated. It was 
not, in fact, until Francis Parkman had touched the 
eyes of a preoccupied public with his magician's 
wand that they began to see the power, the pathos, 
the dramatic appeal of these forgotten documents. 
The writer has had occasion within the last twelve- 
month to read some fifty or sixty original narratives 
of Western Fur-traders, a few in print, many more 
(and these by far the most interesting) in the state 
in which they were written, sometimes on foolscap, 
sometimes on wrapping paper, occasionally (when 
paper was not obtainable) on birch-bark ; and once, 
far ofP in the heart of the Rocky Mountains where 
even birch-bark was not to be had, the fur-trader, 
not to be beaten by circumstances, wrote his journal 
on a thin piece of board. To one familiar with the 
life of the Western trader, pathfinder, pioneer, these 
old manuscripts tell many a tale between the lines. 
Here the paper is browned by the smoke of a camp- 
fire, or scorched in drying the ink too near the 
flames ; here is a grease-spot of a buffalo or moose 
steak ; there the spray of a rapid has blurred a word 
or two ; or perhaps whole pages are illegible, twisted 
out of shape, the ink smeared up and down the page, 
while one pictures the trader's journal thrown from 
the upset canoe and fished up by some following 
paddle. Still more significant are the breaks in the 
narrative. The trader drops his pen or pencil to 
trade a fathom of tobacco, a handful of beads, a 
pound of powder or shot, for peltries or perhaps a 



supply of much-needed pemmican ; he is interrupted 
by a drunken Indian, and pauses long enough to 
turn him out of the fort ; a cry comes from without 
that buffalo are crossing the river, and he rushes out 
to take a hand in the slaughter ; the next day we 
perhaps get the story, graphic in its simplicity and 
directness. Then there comes a time when some 
real or fancied gi'ievance brings down upon the fort 
a war-party of fierce Sioux or Blackfeet ; the trader 
pauses in the midst of a word, hears the menacing 
yell of the savages, grabs his gun and runs to guard 
the gate. The interrupted word is never finished. 
The grimy manuscript, with its fast-fading record 
of a forgotten life, is all that remains to tell the story 
of one who took his part in the stirring drama of 
the Western Fur-trade. 

Then the narratives themselves make anything 
but dry reading. They belong to a period that is 
past, and to a race of men almost extinct. They 
are often absolutely startling in their revelation of 
primitive passions, primitive desires, primitive vir- 
tues, — civilization brought in contact with savagery 
in an untamed environment, dropping the veneer 
of conventionality, gradually approximating to the 
frank simplicity of aboriginal life, though fortunately 
maintaining some grip on the essential virtues. The 
Indian that we meet with in the pages of Alexander 
Henry or Samuel Hearne is almost ludicrously 
unlike the idealized creation of Fenimore Cooper, 
and the traders and voyageurs of real life do not 
remotely resemble those of the drawing-room nov- 
elist ; yet they are none the less interesting on that 
account. 

The student of human nature in the rough will 
'find abundant data in the unexpurgated pages of 
many an old manuscript journal ; the social reformer 
may discover illustrations to point any conceivable 
moral ; the novelist can have his pick of a thousand 
plots from real life, many of them infinitely stranger 
than fiction, and each furnished with its appropriate 
setting. Is there anything more dramatic in fiction 
than the picture of La V^rendrye at the foot of the 
Rocky Mountains, gazing at their glittering peaks 
in the firm belief that immediately beyond lay the 
long-sought Western Sea, and bitterly turning back 
when the prize seemed within his very grasp, be- 
cause of the childish fears of his Indian hosts ; or 
of Simon Fraser threading with grim pertinacity the 
appalling cafion of the Fraser, simply because he 
had been ordered so to do ; or of Alexander Mac- 
kenzie painting that brief but pregnant inscription 
on the shores of the Pacific, " Alexander Mackenzie, 
from Canada, by land the twenty-second of July, 
one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three " ? 

Of the scores of narratives left by Western ex- 
plorers and fur-traders, comparatively few have 
yet been published. In many cases the original 
documents have already been lost or destroyed ; but, 
fortunately, a large number have been gathered into 
the national archives of the two countries, or are 
preserved in the libraries of historical societies.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Mr. Henry James's uteraky methods recall those 
of Walter Pater, if the truth has been told about the 
two writers' manner of composition. It is said of Mr. 
James that he dictates his first draft slowly, and this 
is afterward typewritten by his secretary, with wide 
interlinear spaces. Then, much in the manner of Pater, 
the author goes over this preliminary sketch or skeleton, 
flUing in and elaborating, rounding and padding and 
polishing, until, satisfied with his creation, the artificer 
sends it forth, confident that each faintest shade of 
thought has received adequate expression. From Mr. 
James's latest book, " The American Scene," let us take 
a single sentence, presentmg first its bony structiu-e, 
and then clothing it in all the rounded fairness and 
grace (his detractors might say, the clumsiness and 
heaviness) of its abimdant adipose tissue. Concerning 
Philadelphia's spread-out appearance we read in the 
skeleton, " The absence of the perpetual perpendicidar 
seemed to symbolize the principle of indefinite level 
extension." That is graphic and satisfying. What is 
gained, or lost, by verbal elaboration and somewhat 
eccentric punctuation, will appear from the following: 
" The absence of the note of the perpetual perpendicular, 
the New York, the Chicago note — and I allude here 
to the material, the constructional exhibition of it — 
seemed to symbolize exactly the principle of indefinite 
level extension and to offer refreshingly, a challenge to 
horizontal, to lateral, to more or less tangental, to rotary, 
or, better still, to absolute centrifugal motion." Small ' 
wonder is it that when an acquaintance rashly asked 
Mr. James the exact meaning of a certain sentence of 
his, the distinguished author gravely and coldly replied 
that if the passage as it stood, representing as it did his 
carefully matured thought, did not explain itself to the 
reader, it was ixseless to enter into oral discussion of 
its meaning. ... 

Things new but not true so often make their 
appearance in the daily press under the guise of scien- 
tific facts that a correspondent is moved to write to 
" Science " urging congressional legislation " to check 
the publication of all items that convey erroneous im- 
pressions relative to matters in which the whole com- 
munity is interested." Such censorship of the press is 
undesirable in principle, even if practicable in the matter 
of pseudo-scientific " stories " ; but a little experience of 
newspaper ways soon enables the intelligent to discount 
or wholly disbelieve all items of a startling or sensa- 
tional character. Discoveries and inventions that, 
according to the newspaper, promise speedily to revo- 
lutionize some branch of art or industry or domestic 
economy are published at short intervals, and the cred- 
ulous await developments in eager expectation. But 
developments, or even further references to the epoch- 
making invention or discovery, never come; and least 
of all does the newspaper print a retraction or modifi- 
cation of its startling " story." Not long ago a Roches- 
ter machinist was said by some enterprising reporter to 
have devised an application of steam that would very 



soon consign all existing steam engines to the junk 
heap. Almost any reader of newspapers can cite similar 
instances. They are numerous enough, often amusing, 
but in the end monotonous. 

German and American reading habits are placed 
in instructive comparison by recent reports from two 
public libraries, one in Germany and one in this country, 
serving commimities of about the same size. The Krupp 
Library of Essen, in the fiscal year 1905-6, circulated 
388,001 volumes; the public library of Troy, N. Y., in 
its latest annual report gives a circulation of 62,000 
volumes, or less than one-sixth as many. The Essen 
library, established primarily, we infer, for the benefit 
of Herr Krupp's thirty thousand workers in steel, has 
51,750 volumes. The three-hundred-thousand-dollar 
white-marble library building at Troy shelters, we ven- 
ture to guess, a considerably larger collection ; and the 
city on the Hudson is, besides, something of an educa- 
tional centre, with its Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
its Emma Willard Seminary, and other schools, while 
the Prussian town is known to us chiefly for its output 
of big guns. But in fairness we shoidd add that if the 
people of Altendorf, which was incorporated with 
Essen seven years ago, also depend for their reading 
matter on the Krupp Library, the force of this com- 
parison is weakened. , , , 

Presidential praise of books goes little ways in 
some cases, as in that of " The Woman Who Toils," 
which received a free advertisement in the President's 
" race suicide " letter but is said to have been commer- 
cially unsuccessful on this side of the Atlantic. Con- 
trariwise, " The Simple Life," by Pastor Wagner, 
appears to have been helped by a good word from the 
White House, although the book might well have won 
popularity, but perhaps less quickly, on its own merits. 
Now the query arises, will M. Victor B^rard's scholarly 
work on the " Odyssey " profit appreciably by the com- 
mendation bestowed upon it from the same high quarter? 
It is safe to reply that the book is of too solid worth, 
of too special a nature, to be clamored for by the great 
easy-going, pleasure-seeking public. Eighteen months 
ago, before the English translation had appeared, some 
appreciative references to and quotations from this work 
were made in our pages; and we are now glad to note 
any indication, however faint, that even a fractional 
part of the reading public is beginning to recognize the 
merits of this ingenious and painstakmg French scholar.

Women writers of fiction in England have never 
been more conspicuously in the majority than at present. 
" Not since Rousseau and Richardson," says a careful 
observer of the situation, " has the thought of a nation 
been shaped — or at least reflected — by its novels as 
it is to-day." In a recent list of the twelve best- 
selling books in England not a single male author is 
represented. The titles and authors are : " Fenwick's 
Career," by Mrs. Ward; " The Far Horizon," by Lucas 
Malet (Mrs. Harrison) ; " The Treasure of Heaven," 
by Miss Corelli; "The Gamblers," by Mrs. Thurston;

The Authors' Club anb Publishing Association, 
a new organization of which report reaches us, has 
elaborated a most beautiful scheme for the enrichment 
of its members ; nor are the fair proportions and grace- 
ful outlines of this plan, as an ideal creation, marred 
by the prosaic fact of its utter impracticability. Con- 
vinced that publishers are pocketing the lion's share of 
profit in the book business, the members of this asso- 
ciation propose to do their own publishing, each one for 
himself (or herself) with the moral support of the 
others. " Each author," we read, " is to copyright his 
own book in his own name, and have the say of the 
mechanical make-up thereof, and make what contracts 
he wishes with the printer, etc. ; each author is person- 
ally to pay all the expense of getting his work into 
book form and the expense of newspaper and magazine 
advertising." Excellent ! — except that authors, espe- 
cially new authors, are seldom capitalists, or even in a 
position lightly \,o risk a thousand dollars or so on a 
literary venture. A society of impecunious authors, 
each eager for a generous share of the book-buying 
public's patronage, and so each pitted against his fel- 
lows, has its amusing aspects. We are told it was 
" rumination " on the evils of the existing order that 
" has led to the uprising of the authors." Perhaps a 
little experience of the publisher's trials and troubles 
may in its turn lead to the down-sitting of these same 
authors in a chastened and instructed frame of mind.

A shock to the cultured ear of Boston is the 
present cry of the street-car conductor, " Out the nearest 
door! " — on cars of the two-door pattern. This is a sad 
lapse on the part of a railway company noted for the 
courtesy and intelligence and superior education of its 
officials, and for the correctness of its printed rules and 
signs; a company whose suburban cars rmi thi-ough a 
favored region where the very owls at night, with their 
" to whit, to whom! " teach the lesson of the objective 
case; a company, finally, that shrinks not from the ex- 
pense of two additional letters in its numerous posted 
warnings to the motorman to " run slowly," wliile less 
grammatically conscientious corporations save paint and 
labor by allowing their cars to " rim slow," in defiance 
of Lindley Murray. What shall we say of this raucous 
chant, " Out the nearest door! " — is it a case of super- 
lative ignorance, or merely of comparative carelessness?

Pessimistic despondency over the literary 
outlook is Mr. Frederic Harrison's note ui a recent 
newspaper article on modern English writers and their 
work. Witchery of form, native humor, mother wit, 
creative genius, he avers, are sadly lacking, and their 
places are but ill supplied by careful English, indus- 
trious learning, and sterling common-sense. It is an age 
of machinery, and not of natural spontaneity. Fourteen 
years ago Mr. Harrison, moved by somewhat the same 
spirit that now prompts him to utter his plaint, pub- 
lished a magazine article on " The Decadence of 
Romance " ; but while noting the decline, he yet wound 
up with a cheering assurance that, though modern con- 
ditions were unfavorable for the production of the old- 
time novel of love and war and knightly adventure, 



nevertheless there would somehow and in due season be 
evolved a new form of romance to fit the new environ- 
ment. Is he tired of waiting, that he so soon abandons 
this not unreasonable hope ? He should bear in mind 
that evolution is a slow process. Possibly his despond- 
ency is partly due to the natural ebb of buoyant hope- 
fulness as old age draws on.

The librarian who reads is not lost, we like to 
believe. " The illiterate librarian ' might almost serve 
to designate more than one custodian of books whose 
attention is so largely given to details of administration 
that he forgets the library's primary purpose. At next 
summer's meeting of the American Library Association 
" The Use of Books " is to be the main subject for dis- 
cussion, a wise choice that moves the " Library Journfvl " 
to admit, editorially, that while ways and means rightly 
claim much attention, yet " it is true that in A. L. A. 
conferences and other library meetings so much em- 
phasis has been laid upon methods of administration as 
to obscure the fact that books are the main factor in a 
library, and it is well to insist from time to time upon 
the book in itself as the central fact."

The simplicity of Esperanto, an artificial lan- 
guage remarkably easy for us Indo-Europeans to learn, 
appears to be surpassed by the simplicity of the Chinese 
and Malay tongues, which are extremely difficult for 
us. Count the rules of grammar in each, aiid convince 
yourself. This interesting revelation comes out in the 
course of a little dispute carried on between Professor 
Leo Wiener, of Harvard, who exposes the weaknesses 
of the new language, and a remonstrant Esperantist, 
who hastens to its defense. The truth of the matter 
would seem to be that Esperanto is not, and perhaps 
never claimed to be, a world language, but rather a 
means of inter-communication for that part of the world 
known in a general way as Christendom.

" Greatest scandal waits on greatest state," 
is a truism; but nothing serious need be feared by 
admirers of Walter Pater from the controversy (of a 
mild sort) now developing between the Wright and 
Benson factions in regard to Mr. Wright's new and 
detailed life of Pater, wherein the later biographer 
charges the earlier with twelve astonishing errors. This 
pother will in no wise affect the fair fame of the gentle 
follower of Aristippus, except perhaps to heighten its 
lustre. ... 

The Fielding Bicentenary, to be celebrated on 
the 22d of this month, should bring into clear relief, not 
the coarser qualities of the writer whose freedom of 
scope excited Thackeray's envy, but the sterling vii-tues 
of honesty and fidelity, of manliness and woihanliness, 
that his upright and downright heroes and heroines 
tend to illustrate. There are few old authors to whom 
the mature reader can more profitably and pleasurably 
return than bluff Henry Fielding.

Robinson Crusoe's island is still extant, and not

Those valleys and rocks that (as Cowper affirms) have 
never heard the sound of the church-going bell, still

The Career of a Great Editor.* 

" What a noble record of courage and energy 
in the highest causes to recall " exclaimed James 
Bryce, when the news of Mr. Godkin's death 
reached him, five years ago. And no more ac- 
curate characterization of Mr. Ogden's volumes 
can be given than Mr. Bryce's own words, — 
" a noble record of courage and energy in the 
highest causes.' Like Carl Schurz and Henry 
ViUard, with both of whom he was to be so 
closely connected, Mr. Godkin came to America 
as a young man because he loved the ideals for 
which the great American republic seemed to 
stand, and the opportimities which it seemed to 
offer for working out successfully the great 
problems of human society and government. 

The Godkin family runs back through some 
eight centuries of residence in Ireland to a little 
colony of Englishmen who settled in the Barony 
Forth, on the coast of "Wexford, and became 
Protestants during the period of the Reformat 
tion. James Godkin, the father, driven from 
his Presbyterian pidpit because of his vigorous 
" Eepeal Essays " in support of the Young Ire- 
land movement in 1848, served later as editor 
of the Londonderry " Standard " and after- 
wards of the Dublin " Daily Express," acting 
also as Irish correspondent of the London 
" Times," and was naturally an imtiring advo- 
cate of Home Rule for Ireland to the end. No 
theorist could have devised a better parentage 
for the production of just such a keenly intel- 
lectual and vigorous fighter for reform causes 
as Edwin Godkin proved to be. 

The " singodar powers of expression " com- 
memorated by Mr. Bryce in the felicitous in- 
scription composed for his tombstone, together 
with his keen perception of what was worth 
expressing, were sufficiently developed at the 
age of twenty-two to warrant the London " Daily 
News" in sending him to the East as its cor- 
respondent during the Crimean War. From 
this service Mr. Ogden dates one of the most 
firmly rooted of his later mental and moral 
characteristics : " Indelible impressions were 
gained — chief of them, hatred of war. He had 
seen its horrors naked." We thank Mr. Ogden 
for the expression. Some day the time will 
come when we shall allow a writer with the eye 
of a Godkin to strip the rags of mock patriotism, 
mock modesty, and a good many other mock-

eries, not from war in the abstract, but from 
some real and present war, and give us a good 
square gaze at its stark naked body ; and then 
we shall realize that Bellona is not fit company 
for enlightened and self-respecting people. 

Mr. Godkin reached America soon after the 
close of his Crimean experience, and, as with 
Schurz, his first impressions were of the rising 
opposition to the cruelty and anomaly of slavery. 
He determined at once to see Southern condi- 
tions with his own eyes, and his letters to the 
"Daily News," during a horseback journey 
which lasted from December, 1856, to the fol- 
lowing April, furnish a vivid and instructive 
picture from which Mr. Ogden has drawn some 
fifty pages of well-chosen extracts. We clip 
a bit concerning the Walker " filibuster" episode. 

" While passing over the lake between New Orleans 
and Mobile I was present while one of General Walker's 
agents preached filibusterisin to the passengers in the 
cabin. The facility with which these men are, or rather 
were, allowed to harangue, beat up for recruits, collect 
supplies and arms, and despatch them to the scene of 
hostilities, is a curious commentary upon Mr. Marcy's 
terrible letters to Lord Palmerston. From the high 
moral tone assumed by the United States government 
in its correspondence upon the Crampton afPair, one can 
hardly be got to believe that Walker's agents have had 
recruiting offices open in all the seaports, with flags 
flying from the windows with offers inscribed upon 
them of a free passage to, and free farms in, Nicaragua, 
for more than a year past." 

Doubtless then as later, when Mr. Godkin had 
become a naturalized citizen of the country he 
had loved long before he had ever seen it, many 
readers saw in this only a foreigner virulently 
assailing " American institutions." The major- 
ity of us have not yet reached the point where 
we can appreciate and adopt the higher patriot- 
ism which, like wise and benevolent surgery, 
will build for a more healthf id future by fear- 
lessly cutting and cauterizing where cancerous 
growth or poison has entered. A social or 
political abuse was to him simply a disease, to 
be fought as relentlessly as a physical disease in 
one of his own family, and the untiring energy 
of the fight was as surely the mark and measure 
of his love in the one case as in the other. 

The keen disappointment which Mr. Godkin 
felt in the closing years of his life, when he 
saw the United States, and then England, each 
engaged in a war which seemed to him easily 
avoidable and fraught with the gravest danger 
to fundamental principles of English and Amer- 
ican liberty, was closely akin to the bitter sorrow 
of which Mr. Ogden, with delicate sympathy, 
has given us a glimpse on the occasion of his loss 
of a little daughter and later of his wife.

THE DIAL

It was this passionate love for free institutions, 
quickened by keen perception of the abuses by 
which they were endangered in the one land 
where they seemed otherwise to have the best 
chance of full development, that led Mr. Godkin 
into the movement for establishing "The Nation" 
in 1865. Readers of The Dial do not need a 
detailed support of the statement that he made 
of this modest looking periodical, never of large 
circulation, a power for political regeneration 
before which more wrongdoers have trembled 
than before any other single factor in the whole 
history of American political journalism. The 
rescue of the government service from the 
corruption which the Civil War had found bad 
enough, and left still worse, naturally appealed 
to him as fundamental to all desirable lines of 
improvement. It was truly a cry in the wilder- 
ness when he began. 

" It was, to most people, a strange European whimsey. 
I remember being invited to a breakfast in Washington, 
given by Mr. Henry Adams, who was then one of us, 
to bring together a few friends of the reform and some 
Congressmen. To me fell the task of explaining to a 
United States Senator what we aimed at. He knew 
nothing of Civil Service Reform except the name, and 
that it was 'something, Prussian.' He listened with 
politeness to ray exposition of its merits, but it was 
evident to me that he considered me an estimable huih- 
bug or visionary." 

It was not long that any beneficiary of entrenched 
political abuses was able to regard the writer of 
the editorials in " The Nation " as a visionary 
on the side of attack, at least, though many 
doubtless persuaded themselves that he was 
deficient on the constructive side. Even people 
who ought to know better are sometimes hood- 
winked into the belief that you have no right 
to burn the tents of political pirates, squatting 
on the government preserves, until you have 
some essentially similar structure ready to put 
in their place. The subsequent history of the 
Civil Service movement is clear enough evidence, 
even if other were lacking, that when Mr. God- 
kin felt it his part to take up the work of con- 
struction his ideas always had live roots in the 
solid ground of experience and common sense. 
We cannot take space to follow him through 
the various conflicts into which loyalty to prin- 
ciple and unbounded energy led him, first in 
the columns of " The Nation," and from 1881 
in the " Evening Post." Of course he met 
opposition at many points from thoroughly repu- 
table and disinterested sources. It is no^ nec- 
essary to argue that this opposition was never 
well taken. If we are to recognize no truly 
great, high-minded, and loyal leader until he 



comes to us above the level of possible error of 
judgment, then we shall never have him in this 
world at all. This much may be said, however, 
that when it would have been worth millions to 
malign interests to break down his reputation 
before the American people, no enemy ever 
found it possible to lodge one base or unmanly 
act or motive at his door. It was this high 
idealism, inexpugnable integrity, and unsuUied 
purity of motive, that drew and held for his 
paper so many readers who always felt it nec- 
essary to add to their letters of praise for some 
particular service to any good cause the state- 
ment that they often felt obliged to disagree 
with him. Doubtless approval thus qualified 
always struck him as the best possible proof 
that he was succeeding in his fundamental pur- 
pose, that of stimulating really vigorous thought 
on social and political problems in the minds of 
intelligent men. For the class of critics who 
would echo the gibe of some exposed rascal that 
his only dissatisfaction with himself was " the 
fact that his name had one too many syllables " 
he could feel nothing but amused contempt. 
His weapons were reserved for foes of more 
significance. 

The cry of "pessimism" was often raised 
against him, a word which in recent times has 
run a neck-and-neck competition with " patriot- 
ism " as " the last refuge of scoundrels." The 
clearness of vision which can distinguish evil 
from good, the firm belief in the human possi- 
bility of intellectual and moral progress, the 
vivid hope that such progress would follow 
intelligent effort, the readiness to put his life 
enthusiastically into such effort, — these were the 
elements of the " pessimism " of Edwin Law- 
rence Godkin ; and when really intelligent peo- 
ple come to reject this for a style of " optimism " 
which coidd see existing evils with the clear eye 
of a Godkin and still be " at ease in Zion," then 
the time for a real pessimism will indeed have 
come. That the conditions growing out of the 
Spanish and Boer wars saddened his declining 
years is of course known to all ; but it was no 
sadness of final despair, as is well shown by an 
extract from a letter written from England to 
Wendell P. Garrison, within less than six 
months of his death. " Some day I believe civil 
service reform will have become as obvious in 
America as it is here ; anything else is unthink- 
able. The anti-slavery fight seemed even more 
hopeless, yet it was won, and now people won- 
der that there ever was any fight at all." And 
it was that other arch " pessimist," Professor 
Norton, who wrote to Mr. Godkin only two

years earlier, — " when the work of this cen- 
tury is summed up, what you have done for the 
good old cause of civilization, the cause which 
is always defeated, hut always after defeat 
taking more advanced position than before, — 
what you have done for this cause will count 
for much." 

To Mr. Godkin's strenuous warfare against 
injustice and wrong-doing. Professor A. V. 
Dicey added as his second pronounced char- 
acteristic " his extraordinary kindness to his 
friends." Mr. Ogden's records of this kindness 
make the most delightful reading. Among 
those friends were Bryce and Dicey and Leslie 
Stephen, Lowell and Curtis, Professor Norton 
and his accomplished sisters, Gilman and Eliot 
and Andrew D. White, and a host of others 
whose names are of the very cream of moral and 
intellectual worth on both sides of the ocean. 
Nothing could be finer than his respect and 
affection for his colleague, the late WendeU P. 
Garrison, whose inestimable services to " The 
Nation " were noticed editorially in The Dial 
of March 16. 

The work of Mr. Ogden on these volumes has 
been admirably done. With an editorial self- 
suppression which finds its best parallel in the 
work of Professor Norton, he has given us Mr. 
Godkin's story from Mr. Godkin's own pen, 
supplying only the connecting links without 
which that story could not be fully understood. 
If on every educated American's most accessible 
shelves it could have its fitting place alongside 
Curtis's " Addresses and Orations," the " Let- 
ters of James RusseU Lowell," the " Life of 
William Lloyd Garrison " by his sons, and 
Bryce's "American Commonwealth," there 
would be little ground for pessimism as to the 
future of Democracy in America.

The Art op Whistler.* 



Art-criticism of the higher order that rests 
upon the firm basis of a sound, consistent, and 
comprehensive fundamental metaphysic has 
made great strides in the years since the Pre- 
Raphaelite Brotherhood, preaching their doc- 
trine of " sincerity," made impassioned protest 
against pseudo-classicism, and John Ruskin woke 
up the critics and art lovers of his day by his 
trenchant sentences and by the captivating rhet- 
oric that still, for many, conceals the defects

in his philosophy. Out of a maze of conflicting 
ideas the true concept has gradually emerged. 
As to what is the right point of view, there is 
now little difference of opinion among the writers 
and critics who are conceded to belong to the 
first rank. 

Nevertheless, there is no royal road by which 
this point of view may be attained. Each one 
must traverse anew the many complex and puz- 
zling problems that beset the path leading to 
the heights from whence is unembarrassed vis- 
ion, and many thei'e are that get halted by the 
wayside. The man who starts with the firm 
belief that the vital thing in art is the spiritual 
content, as distinguished from the manner and 
quality of its presentation, seldom gets much 
further ; though the difference between his out- 
look and that of the artist and connoisseur may 
ever remain to him an inscrutable mystery. 

For those who hold this opinion, Miss Elisa- 
beth Luther Gary's exceedingly interesting study 
of the works of James McNeill Whistler offers 
much food for thought. And they, as well as 
those who do not need its lesson, should be able 
to find in it much pleasant mental refreshment. 
As a piece of critical writing, it is eminently 
sound and true to right principles. In dealing 
with an art as refined in conception and execu- 
tion as that of Mr. Whistler, — so exclusive, 
one might say, — it is needful to have clear 
understanding and fine discrimination. These 
qualities characterize Miss Gary's book in a high 
degree. Within the brief space of eight short 
chapters the master's achievements in the several 
media in which he worked are surveyed and 
analyzed with rare insight, and the whole aspect 
and trend of his art are set forth. 

The estimate that places Mr. Whistler among 
the foremost of modem artists, and even counts 
him the greatest of these, is difficult for the 
general public to understand. He did not paint 
for " the man in the street." Nor, indeed, did 
he paint for the connoisseurs and critics, but for 
the pure delight he foimd in creating beautiful 
things. No artist was ever less influenced in 
his work by what others thought or felt about 
it. For anecdotal art he had unbounded con- 
tempt. As an elaborate binding upon a book 
that is not read usurps the first place in the 
eyes of the observer, so does a story introduced 
into a picture. More than that, in telling the 
story the artist is apt to leave out his art. 
Whistler would have none of it. As a story- 
teller he had a marked gift, but he was too much 
of an artist to tell his stories with brush or 
pencil. 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



219 



This statement does not imply that his art, 
as has been alleged, deals solely with externals 
and is lacking in expressive and " human " 
qualities. How full of these it really is, Miss 
Cary easily demonstrates. She points out that 
what Mr. Whistler was concerned with was not 
cheap realism, which he scorned, but quintes- 
sential truth — the very soul and poetry of 
things seen. It is this that gives vitality to 
almost everything he did. One may contem- 
plate his brushwork with the greatest satisfac- 
tion ; linger with delight over the skilful use of 
line in his etchings ; gaze with rapture upon his 
marvellous touch with pastel, by which he suc- 
ceeded in realizing something of the ineffable 
"dipped quality " — to use his own phrase — 
that is so precious in the glaze of certain choice 
pieces of Japanese pottery. Yet it is not the 
masterly technique that makes the deepest im- 
pression. Technique with Whistler was always 
a means to an end, and never a thing to be 
exploited for its own sake. He took infinite 
pains to conceal all traces of laborious effort. 
What he did care greatly for was the planning 
of the spaces and accents, the arrangement of 
lights and darks, the harmonious combination 
and interplay of color, the subtle discrimination 
in the tone values, — all the elements, that is, 
of composition. These things, it should per- 
haps be said, are not a part of technique. They 
belong to conception, not to execution. 

The sure feeling with which Miss Gary has 
penetrated the message of Whistler's art is well 
shown in the following descriptions of two of 
his works owned in New York : 

"One of Mr. Mansfield's drawings represents a 
woman of great nobility of form, whose classic drapery 
does not disguise her classic proportions, and who stands 
leaning with one arm resting on a shelf or ledge. The 
effect is rendered by the slightest means, bvit the dispo- 
sition of the weight, the swell of the arm supporting 
the body, the relaxation of the other arm, the capacity 
of the whole strong buoyant figure to move with energy 
and lightness, are perfectly felt. These are the facts 
essential to our enjoyment, and they are not obscured 
by any irrelevances. They keep alive the spirit in which 
ancient art realized the nude by the consistent rejec- 
tion of all but its life-enhancing and aesthetic attributes. 
They touch idealism on the side of this rejection, but 
they have all that is artistically important in the real." 

Of the famous " Nocturne in Black and Gold : 
The Falling Rocket," now owned by Mrs. 
Samuel Untermyer, she says : 

" A concentrated blaze of light fills the scene with 
splendor and there is a double line of rising and falling 
fire. Here again is the reproduction of a beautiful 
visual image-by the abstract means familiar in Japanese 
art and only recently familiar in Western art. The 
dark masses of blackish gray foliage, the dusky blue 



sky, the smoke irradiated against it and cooling and 
graying in color as it rises, the yellowish gray fore- 
ground make a pattern of line and color lovely in itself, 
that would still be lovely if the orange and yellow of 
the fireworks were stains of blood and carnage, if the 
smoke rose from a battle-ground, if the dark hulks of 
the trees were heaps of slain. The beauty is absolutely 
independent of the subject, and the sentiment of the 
scene is strictly the pictorial sentiment. The exclusive 
propriety of this sentiment in works of art is what 
Whistler strove to impress upon his hearers in his ' Ten 
O'clock,' and what Ruskin was instinctively combatting 
when he called the ' Nocturne in Black and Gold ' a 
' pot of paint flung in the public's face.' " 

The haK-tone illustrations of the pictures 
described in these extracts serve chiefly to em- 
phasize the reasonableness of Whistler's objec- 
tion to all reproductions of his works. The most 
that can be said of the thirty illustrations in 
the book is that they add something to its use- 
fulness. More than half of the volume is taken 
up by lists of Whistler's paintings, drawings, 
lithographs, and etchings, which should prove 
serviceable for reference. These lists have been 
compilied principally from Exhibition catalogues. 
The retention of the phrase "lent by" as an 
indication of present ownership seems a little 
out of place. This, however, and a few slips in 
proof-reading, are blemishes so slight as hardly 
to be worth mentioning. In its outward ap- 
pearance the book shows unusual taste. The 
deep cream-colored paper is perhaps a little too 
thick and makes the volume needlessly heavy ; 
but the combination of color in paper and bind- 
ing is a delight to the eye. 

The aptness of Miss Gary's phraseology is 
deserving of more than casual comment. Ex- 
ception must, however, be taken to one expres- 
sion, because it denotes an erroneous use of a 
word that is very common. In speaking of 
Whistler's etchings she says he felt " the charm 
and value of spontaneity of effect and a deco- 
rative plan." It is evident that what is meant 
by " a decorative plan " is a carefuUy balanced 
space composition. The use of the word " deco- 
rative " to describe it is inaccurate. A thing 
cannot be decorative unless its purpose or use 
is to decorate some other thing. 

In contrast to this verbal slip, the words with 
which the author ends her chapter " On 
Whistler's Theory of Art " may be quoted. 

" One more impression of his quality may be added 
to this incomplete notation, not for its special but for 
its general importance. He has been described truth- 
fully as the apostle of good taste, with a minifying 
inflection suggested in the phrase. But good taste no 
longer is a negligible quantity in any practice of life. It 
involves particularly a sense of the appropriate which 
is not the grammar but the style of poetry. It implies

sacrifices and restraints worthy of a passionate dedica- 
tion, and so far as passion is felt in Whistler's art, it is 
felt as the passion of a decorum known to the modern 
as to the ancient in its highest function. Dulce et 
decorum est not only to die for one's country, but to live 
for one's ideal. This with singleness of mind he did."

Shakespeare and the Modern Stage.* 

Mr. Sidney Lee, a man whose utterances on 
Shakespeare always merit attention, has brought 
together an exceedingly interesting series of 
papers contributed by him to various periodi- 
cals, in a volume entitled " Shakespeare and the 
Modern Stage.' The papers differ, of course, 
in value, the last five being of less interest and 
importance than the others. It is indeed not 
a little remarkable that so interesting a subject 
as Shakespeare's Philosophy should have been 
treated in so sketchy and inadequate a fashion. 
The perfectly sound principle adopted by Mr. 
Lee, that ideas recurring frequently, though not 
always appropriately, on the lips of Shake- 
speare's characters may be safely accepted as 
Shakespeare's own, should be carried much fur- 
ther than he has chosen to carry it. It seems, 
for instance, to lead inevitably to a stronger 
conviction of Shakespeare's fundamental fatal- 
ism than Mr. Lee appears to hold. 

But the first six papers of the volume, though 
brief, are of considerable importance, and form 
a group by themselves ; for with one exception 
they deal more or less directly with the staging 
of Shakespeare's plays. The first of them, 
which appropriately gives a title to the book, 
is a sane and practical plea for emphasis upon 
stage essentials — adequate scenery, trained 
actors, and a varied repertory. The modem 
stage, on the contrary, seems to be largely com- 
mitted to tendencies that are the direct opposite 
of these, — to an elaboration of accessories that 
forbids the exercise of the imagination ; to the 
sacrifice of the play to the leading actor, and 
the consequent disaster to the training of the 
rest of the company ; and to the system of long 
runs of single plays, which is necessitated by 
the elaborate staging, but is quite certain to 
produce monotonous and wooden acting. In 
this connection, Mr. Lee pays a high and de- 
served tribute to the aims and achievements of 
Mr. F. S. Benson. The chief value of this 
paper, however, does not reside in its ideal stand- 
ard for Shakespearean productions. No one

who is competent to express an opinion would 
deny the correctness of these positions. The great 
objection made to this standard is that it is a 
counsel of perfection, and that an attempt to 
apply it will empty the house and the manager's 
pocket alike. But Mr. Lee makes it quite clear, 
from the testimony of Phelps, that Shakespeare 
presented in this manner can be made to " pay," 
and he makes it equally clear, from the expe- 
rience of Charles Kean and Sir Henry Irving, 
that the current method is sometimes ruinous 
from a business as well as an artistic point of 
view. 

It was a happy thought of Mr. Lee's to write 
a paper on " Pepys and Shakespeare," and this, 
no doubt, many readers wiU find the most amus- 
ing thing in the volume, — amusing not only 
because of Pepys's moral scruples as to play- 
going, but also because of the vagaries of his 
dramatic taste. Over and over he determined 
to go to the theatre no more, or at any rate to 
limit the frequency of his visits ; but the tempta- 
tion was too strong. He resorted to sophis- 
tries to justify himself, — as when he held him- 
self excused for going to Drury Lane " because 
it was not built when his vow was framed," and 
when he congratulated himseK that his vow had 
been kept because, though he went to the Duke 
of York's House, he was unable to get places. 
But he probably imposed upon himself the 
strongest pressure of which his thrifty soul was 
capable when he vowed to give ten pounds to 
the poor if he went to the theatre oftener than 
once in a fortnight. " This, I hope in God will 
bind me," he said. " A Midsummer Nights 
Dream " he found " insipid and ridiculous," 
" Twelfth Night" "silly " and " weak," "Romeo 
and Juliet " " the worst that ever I heard," and 
" OtheUo," when compared with Tuke's "Ad- 
ventures of Five Hours," " a mean thing." His 
refusing his bookseller's offer of a copy of the 
First Folio and his choice of Fidler's "Worthies '" 
and Butler's " Hudibras " instead, are explica- 
ble enough when we remember Pope's failure, 
many years later, to appreciate the value of the 
Folio. Pepys lived at a critical time in the his- 
tory of the Shakespearean stage, and his diary 
is therefore of great interest to students of 
dramatic history. On the third of January, 
1661, he first saw women's parts acted by 
women. It was during his career as a play- 
goer that elaborate scenery and costumes be- 
came a regular feature of dramatic performances ; 
the mechanical and spectacular devices used in 
the production of "The Tempest" that he wit- 
nessed would do credit to Mr. Tree himself.

The theatre of the Restoration retained, how- 
ever, the immense advantage of a stage extend- 
ing far out into the house, from which, as Colley 
Gibber wrote, " the most distant ear had scarce 
the least doubt or difficulty in hearing what fell 
from the weakest utterance, . . . nor was the 
minutest motion of a feature, properly chang- 
ing with the passion or humor it suited, ever 
lost ... in the obscurity of too great a distance" 
(p. 90). Pepys's attitude, after all, is really 
that of the average British and American play- 
goer, who, "if he were gifted with the diarist's 
frankness, . . . would echo the diarist's condem- 
nation of Shakespeare in his poetic purity, of 
Shakespeare as the mere interpreter of human 
nature, of Shakespeare without flying machines, 
of Shakespeare without song and dance ; he 
woidd characterize undiluted Shakespearean 
drama as ' a mean thing,' or the most tedious 
entertainment that ever he was at in his 
life " (p. 110). 

The last paper in the volume bearing directly 
upon the modern production of Shakespeare is 
that on " The Mimicipal Theatre," in which Mr. 
Lee urges the success of the Vienna Volks- 
Theater as an example to London, and pleads 
for this public recognition of the stage as an 
important instrument of popular education. In 
this connection, Phelps's words may well be 
borne in mind : " I maintain from the experience 
of eighteen years, that the perpetual iteration 
of Shakespeare's words, if nothing more, going 
on daily for so many months of the year, must 
and would produce a great effect upon the public 
mind" (p. 120). 

These are but a few of the many points of 
interest and value in this collection of papers, 
which will prove a boon to every student of 
Shakespeare. Charles H. A. Wager. 



IjORd ACTON'S Ideals of History.* 



It is a remarkable fact that much of the his- 
torical writing emanating from England within 
the last five years professes to draw its inspira- 
tion from the teachings and precepts of the late 
Lord Acton. His brief six years' tenure of 
the position of Regius Professor of Modem 
History at Cambridge resvdted in a deep-seated

belief in the universality of his knowledge and 
a trust in the correctness of his ideals. The 
editors of that monumental work now appear- 
ing, the " Cambridge Modern History," asserted 
in the preface to their first volume that they 
were striving to follow the plans outlined by 
Lord Acton, who was to have been the editor- 
in-chief of the undertaking. Historical essayists, 
as well as the authors of more ambitious his- 
torical productions, have confessed themselves 
inspired by the teachings of one whom they re- 
garded almost as a master. And yet Lord 
Acton himself was not a producer, and has 
nowhere stated definitely and at length his ideals 
of historical study and historical writing. It is 
partly with the purpose of emphasizing and ex- 
plaining these ideals, partly to expand beyond 
the circle of personal acquaintance a true knowl- 
edge of Lord Acton's great qualities, that two 
volumes have recently appeared from the pens 
of close friends and admirers. 

The first of these, by Abbot Gasquet, is 
whoUy taken up with the letters of Lord Acton 
to his fellow editors of " The Rambler," and 
later of the " Home and Foreign Review." 
Acton became part proprietor and one of the 
editors of " The Rambler " m 1858, and after 
the discontinuance of that magazine engaged 
himself, together with several of his colleagues, 
in the organization of the short-lived " Home 
and Foreign Review." Both of these were 
Catholic publications, and by far the greater 
part of the letters in Abbot Gasquet's volume 
have to do with questions of policy and attitude 
relating to parties and controversies within the 
Roman Catholic body. The editor himself re- 
marks that many of the points involved were, 
even at the time, understood by none but edu- 
cated Catholics, and that most of them have 
since almost dropped from memory. It follows 
that Lord Acton's letters in this volmne are in 
general quite beyond the understanding or ap- 
preciation of the non-Catholic reader of to-day. 
Yet even such blind reading cannot fail to 
impress one with the truth of the claim for 
Lord Acton of a universality of knowledge. His 
interests were never insular — though he always 
exhibited a thorough British patriotism — but 
extended to all modern lands ; whenever during 
his frequent sojourns upon the continent he 
wrote of contemporary political conditions, his 
criticisms showed keenness of immediate per- 
ception as well as thoroughness of historical 
knowledge. 

But such letters are infrequent in the present 
volume, and were it not for a careful historical 



222 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



preface one might easily miss the point of Lord 
Acton's attitude as editor of a Catholic maga- 
zine. That attitude reveals at least one of Lord 
Acton's ideals in historical study, — namely, a 
devotion to absolute and accurate historical 
truth. He was a devout Catholic, but he was 
equally devout in his love of truth, and was 
never willing to let his loyalty to the Church 
relax in the slightest degree the rigor of any 
historical presentation of previous Church con- 
ditions or persons. Abbot Gasquet brings this 
out very clearly in his preface, and quotes an 
article in " The Rambler," not written by Lord 
Acton, but perfectly representing his principles. 

" We [Catholics] have to encounter the belief that 
we are not only crafty and false, but actually afraid of 
the truth's being known. This belief has to be van- 
quished, not by an angry denial of its justice, not by 
tairnts, not by bragadocio, but by proving our courage 
by our acts. It is useless to proclaim that history and 
science are in harmony with our religion, unless we 
show that we think so by being ourselves foremost in 
telling the whole truth about the Church and about her 
enemies." 

The policy maintained by " The Rambler " 
had the quiet support of Cardinal Newman and 
of many of the most thoughtful Catholics in 
England ; but it was attacked with vigor by a 
faction really, though not avowedly, directed by 
Cardinal Wiseman, and the originality and dar- 
ing of " The Rambler " made it an object of 
nervous distrust to the general and more con- 
servative Catholic body. " The Rambler " and 
the " Dublin Review " were far apart in their 
treatment of Church history. Abbot Gasquet 
writes : 

" In historical matters, the policy of ' The Dublin ' 
appears to have been to avoid, as far as possible, facing 
unpleasant facts in the past, and to explain away, if it 
could not directly deny, the existence of ' blots ' in the 
ecclesiastical annals of the older centuries. * The 
Rambler,' on the other hand, held the view that the 
Church had nothing to lose and much to gain by meet- 
ing facts as they were. And acting up to this, it did 
not hesitate to discuss the conduct of the Popes of the 
Renaissance and the characters of canonized saints, etc., 
with entire freedom, on the ground that no supreme 
office nor assumed sanctity was an a priori proof of 
impeccability, and that it should not shield the one class 
or the other from legitimate criticism. It taunted all 
those who would attempt, for example, the rehabilitation 
of ' bad popes,' and would desire that all should shut 
their eyes to the unpleasant facts of Church history, as 
being plain ' whitewashers. ' " 

Many attempts were made to smooth over the 
difficulties arising from these two diverse points 
of view, but in the end the situation became an 
impossible one, and " The Rambler " suspended 
publication, as did its successor, " The Home 
and Foreign Review," after a brief existence 



in which an unsuccessful effort was made to 
keep away from controversial topics. Neither 
of these publications was suspended, says Abbot 
Gasquet in contradiction of ordinary historical 
accounts, because of direct intervention from 
Rome, but rather because Lord Acton and his 
friends yielded to the conviction that such con- 
troversies tended to over-emphasize what were, 
after all, unessential differences within the 
Church. They yielded their active assertion 
of opinions by publication, but retained the 
opinions. And Abbot Gasquet asserts also that 
to-day the criticisms and opinions of the Catho- 
lic circle, as he likes to call it, would meet with 
no opposition from the authorities of the Church. 
But the preface to the volume of Lord Acton's 
" Lectures on Modern History " gives a different 
impression of the results of this controversy ; 
for here it is stated that Lord Acton, wearied 
and unsuccessful in the contest, welcomed the 
quiet promised by his appointment to Cambridge, 
and in the almost passionate devotion he exhib- 
ited for the concrete truths of history evidenced 
the bitterness remaining from the struggle 
through which he had passed. The lectures here 
printed include the Inaugural lecture of 1895, 
and nineteen lectures covering the period from 
the Renaissance to the American Revolution, 
delivered in the academical years from 1899 to 
1901. According to the editors of this voliune, 
much of Lord Acton's influence arose from the 
enthusiasm for his subject manifested by the 
lecturer, so that when placed in cold type the 
lectures may seem inadequate in comparison with 
Lord Acton's reputation. It is certainly true 
that a first impression derived from a rapid 
reading is that the lectures contain little that 
could not be found in any ordinary brief history 
of the period. But as one reads more carefully 
he realizes that every statement of fact, every 
idea expressed, has been carefully selected, or 
thoroughly weighed ; that the simple language 
used is purposely chosen in order that no con- 
fusion may arise ; that the few facts cited and 
illustrations given, from the multitude that 
might have been employed, are the exact ones 
best suited to the lecturer's purpose ; and above 
aU, that there runs through each lecture an 
ideal of the progressive development of modem 
history so delicately stated as to be whoUy unob- 
trusive, yet so clearly conveyed as to be per- 
fectly unmistakable. It is easy to assert the 
unity of the history of modern states, or to phi- 
losophize upon it and choose isolated illustra- 
tions by way of proof ; but the highest form of 
art in historical writing is that which narrates 



1907.]

223 



events without specifying directly the ideals it 
is sought to convey, and yet does emphatically 
convey such ideals to the reader. Of this form, 
Lord Acton's lectures are all excellent illustra- 
tions ; while that on Luther may well stand as 
an almost perfect example. 

In his Inaugural lecture. Lord Acton used a 
more direct form ; and here he stated quite 
clearly his ideals of the real purpose of histor- 
ical study. He told the contributors to the 
Modern History series which he had planned, 
that " the recent past contains the key to the 
present time "; and in the Inaugural, delivered 
some years earlier, he emphasized the usefulness 
of history in freeing the mind from " illusions 
or unsifted prejudices." " Its study fulfils its 
purpose, even if it only makes us wiser, without 
producing books, and gives us the gift of his- 
torical thinking, which is better than historical 
learning." And again he said : 

" For our purpose, the main thing to learn is not the 
art of accumulating material, but the sublimer art of 
investigating it, of discerning truth from falsehood and 
certainty from doubt. It is by solidity of criticism, more 
than by the plenitude of erudition, that the study of his- 
tory strengthens and straightens and extends the mind." 

These were his beliefs as to the purposes of his- 
torical study, asserting its practical character 
and emphasizing the love of truth for truth's 
sake ; but in treating of historical writing he 
elucidates that which was the great character- 
istic of his own lectures — the unity of modern 
history, and that a constant " progress in the 
direction of organized and assured freedom is its 
characteristic fact and its tribute to the theory 
of Providence." 

In fact, the two ideals that dominated Lord 
Acton's plan for the " Cambridge Modern 
History" were, the study of historical condi- 
tions that the present time might be rightly 
interpreted, and a conception of history based 
on the thought of universal progress. These 
ideals were to be made manifest by the pens of 
men who were masters of the particular epochs 
of which they wrote. In the preface to their 
first volume, the present editors of the series 
state that they " have adhered scrupulously to 
the spirit of his [Acton's] design." But the 
editors of Lord Acton's Lectures evidently do 
not agree that these ideals have been strictly 
followed, and, although not offering any criti- 
cism, have published as an Appendix Lord 
Acton's original letter to the contributors out- 
lining his purpose. In this the most striking 
paragraphs are the following : 

"The recent Past contains the key to the present 
time. All forms of thought that influence it come 



before us in their turn, and we have to describe the 
ruling currents, to interpret the sovereign forces, that 
still govern and divide the world." 

" By Universal History I understand that which is 
distinct from the combined history of all countries, 
which is not a rope of sand, but a continuous develop- 
ment, and is not a burden on the memory, but an illum- 
ination of the soul. It moves in a succession to which 
the nations are subsidiary. Their story will be told, 
not for their own sake, but in reference and in subor- 
dination to a higher series, according to the time and 
degree in which they contribute to the common fortunes 
of mankind." 

The second paragraph of the preceding quota 
tion is given, with some slight changes in word- 
ing, by the present editors of the Modern His^ 
tory series in their Inaugural preface ; but it is 
exactly in the purpose here indicated that the 
later volumes have more and more departed 
from Lord Acton's ideals. It is true also that 
the original plan of having each chapter written 
by the best quahfied specialist has not been fol- 
lowed. In the present volume on the Thirty 
Years War, for example, twelve of the twenty- 
seven chapters are contributed by the editors 
themselves. It may well have been discovered, 
however, that it was impossible to secure the 
one recognized specialist supposedly available 
for each minute period and topic, and certainly 
no just criticism can be directed against either 
the matter or the method of Mr. A. W. Ward's 
six chapters in the present volume. But when 
Lord Acton's main purpose is considered, — 
the purpose of leaving on the mind of the reader 
an indelible impression of the continuous de- 
velopment of modern history, — it cannot but 
be acknowledged that no single author in this 
volume has succeeded in conveying such ideas 
as Lord Acton himself has conveyed them in 
his lectures. Compare, for example. Lord 
Acton's lecture on Richelieu with Mr. Stanley 
Leathe's chapter on the same character. Lord 
Acton first guards his hearers against an over- 
estimation of Richelieu's abilities by stating 
his "low- water mark"; he then analyzes what 
Richelieu really accomplished, and this analysis, 
accompanied by pertinent illustrations, renders 
the final dictum convincing. Mr. Leathes gives 
pages of exact and careful detail in relation to 
Richelieu's acts and policy, gradually building 
a feeling of the greatness of his supposed hero ; 
then, in a few pages of adverse criticism, he 
destroys the figure he has created. In fact, his 
criticism is not really criticism, but rather 
merely a bald denial of the merits usually 
credited to Richelieu, and reads much like a 
condensation of Avenel's dicta. Lord Acton 
presents Richelieu as but the tool of his time, 



224 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



the personification in France of the ripening 
age of political absolutism ; his acts and policy, 
as in the toleration he showed to Protestants, 
indicative of a change in world policy, when 
France, in this period, was a leader. In short. 
Lord Acton depicts Richelieu as an evidence of 
progressive development in modern history. All 
this Mr. Leathes does not see, or at least does 
not state even by implication ; with the result 
that his detailed accuracy fails utterly to give 
to Richelieu a distinct place or purpose in his- 
tory. Thus the genius and the art of Lord 
Acton in conveying ideas while strictly adher- 
ing to historical truth are wholly lacking in 
this, and in by far the greater number of spe- 
cialized chapters in the " Cambridge Modem 
History." 

It may be that the ideal of Lord Acton of a 
new history that should present " a continiious 
development . . . not a burden on the memory, 
but an illumination of the soul," has been found 
impossible of realization by the present editors ; 
or perhaps they are among those historians who 
would deny that such an ideal is compatible with 
a truthful and accurate narration of historical 
events. It is not here necessary to repeat what 
has previously been stated of earlier volumes of 
this series, that it still remains a wonderful com- 
pendium of historical knowledge, to be trusted 
in details, and containing many unusual aids for 
the student and the investigator. Yet its claim 
to a wholly original method is not well founded, 
for other works of a similar character have been 
equally devoted to accurate historical mono- 
graphs written by specialists, while Lord Acton's 
conception, — the conception of a modern history 
that should move " in a succession to which the 
nations are subsidiary," and should be " not a 
burden on the memory, but an illumination of 
the soul," — has, either intentionally or by lack 
of ability to evolve it, been wholly set aside.

Three Books on Musicians and Music* 



In a well-made volume called " The Romantic 
Composers," Mr. Daniel Gregory Mason has 
gathered a number of essays covering the period 
of musical history in which devotion to form 
was rapidly modified by the insistence on the 
personal message, and the lyrical emotion of the

composer foimd or made its way toward utter- 
ance through the possibilities of the modem 
orchestra. The six composers chosen by Mr. 
Mason to illustrate this movement are Schubert, 
Schumann, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Berlioz, and 
Liszt. To the study of these widely varying 
natures Mr. Mason brings acute musical percep- 
tion, a sure grasp of his thesis, and an intelligent 
sympathy which never weakens into partisan- 
ship. He h^ no love for the advanced realism 
of to-day, but frankly confesses that his attacks 
on it will probably find few assenting voices. 
His views are set forth in clear and vigorous 
English, and with a self-respecting reserve as 
far as possible from the gush which makes so 
many easily- written books on music such terribly 
hard reading. Of the various essays, the one 
on Schumann seems to have been written from 
most intimate knowledge and sympathy, and 
will probably be read with most satisfaction. 
Mr. Mason admits the justice, from a technical 
point of view, of Weingartner's criticism of the 
Schumann symphonies as " composed for the 
pianoforte and arranged for the orchestra "; but 
urges the intrinsic tonal beauty of the themes 
as a compensating merit. The two papers on 
Mendelssohn and Berlioz are fine characteriza- 
tions of two careers whose mutual contrast is 
well-nigh antipodal. On the whole, Mr. Mason 
has given us a delightful book, well worth the 
attention of both amateur and professional. 

The " Mastersingers " of Mr. Filson Young 
is a republication, with some additions, of a 
series of essays on musical subjects which ap- 
peared several years ago and which has there- 
fore won something more than ephemeral recog- 
nition in England and America. As the work 
of so youthful a writer (Mr. Young tells us that 
he was only nineteen when most of them were 
published), these papers display a remarkable 
maturity of thought and even world wisdom ; 
and the fervid intensity of many passages is 
intelligible and excusable. Some of the essays 
are " programme " interpretations of great sym- 
phonies like Beethoven's Pastoral and Tschai- 
kowsky's Pathetic ; " Tristan and Isolde " is a 
more objective description of Wagner's great 
drama of love and death ; and " The Spirit of 
the Piano " is a very just appreciation of 
Chopin's genius. Mr. Young's essay on Hector 
Berlioz may profitably be comj)ared with that 
of Mr. Mason mentioned above ; and in " The 
Music of the Cafes " we have a brief but telling 
sketch of the most innocent feature in the strange 
half -world of Paris. 

Mr. Lawrence GUman has for some years

THE DIAL 



225 



been saying good things about music to the 
readers of American periodicals. Some of his 
articles have been carefully revised and pub- 
lished in book form imder the title of " The 
Music of To-morrow." It would seem that 
Wagner is of yesterday, Strauss of to-day ; and 
for to-morrow we are to attain unto the under- 
standing of such composers as Vincent d'Indy, 
Claude de Bussey, and Charles Martin Loeffler. 
This position is maintained by Mr. Oilman with 
a persuasive rhetoric that will appeal most 
strongly to those who have studied the works of 
these latest exponents of the divine art. As for 
Richard Strauss, it is interesting, in view of the 
recent clamor about " Salome," to note that 
Mr. Oilman regards him (quoting the epigram 
of Mr. Ernest Newman) as "an enormously 
clever man who was once a genius." " Salome " 
is strongly objected to by Mr. Oilman, not be- 
cause it is wicked, but because it is weak. The 
repelling subject is not atoned for by splendid 
music : " the score is rich in the familiar 
audacities of Strauss 's style, but they are with- 
out point, without grip," in short, the contor- 
tions of the Sibyl without her inspiration, — a 
conclusion from which some musicians will be 
inclined to dissent, who think that the score of 
" Salome " shows growth instead of decline, and 
would place Strauss's nadir at the " Sinfonia 
Domestica." Josiah Renick Smith. 



Recent Fiction.* 



A new book by the author of " Sir Richard 
Calmady " is at hand, and may be reckoned among 
the more considerable fictional productions of the

a title which symbolizes the quest of the eager spirit 
for an ideal which lies beyond the range of our im-

mediate perceptions, and is revealed only to the 
clarified vision that can pierce the grossness of the 
sensual mists that envelope our daily lives. This 
ideal is embodied for Mrs. Harrison (as is well 
known) in the Catholic church, and her book is 
essentially the narrative of a new pilgrim's progress 
toward that shining distant goal. Her pilgrim is of 
mingled Irish and Spanish blood, whose life has 
been shaped by circumstance into the conventional 
English mould. For upwards of fifty years he has 
led a prosaic existence of mechanical routine as a 
clerk in a banking house. He has certain marks 
of distinction, however, — such as the name of 
Dominic Iglesias and a physiognomy of refined and 
ascetic type — which have always stood as the signs 
of a character too finely individualized to lose its 
stamp. He has done his daily work with faithful 
efficiency until the time when we make his acquaint- 
ance, the critical time which superannuates him 
and throws him in bewilderment upon his inner re- 
sources. Then romance makes an unheralded en- 
trance into his life — romance as embodied in 
a dazzling creature named Poppy St. John. She 
is a being of air and fire, a creature of impulses 
that have been sadly in need of regulation, for lack 
whereof she has gone sadly astray. But she so 
captivates us (as she captivates Dominic) that we 
half forget her frailty in the revelation of the better 
possibilities of her nature. What follows upon the 
knitting of a relationship between these two is no 
vulgar liaison, but the upspringing of long dormant 
higher instincts in both their souls. The rare sym- 
pathy which henceforth links their lives in spiritual 
union reveals to both the far horizon; the woman 
divests her life of unworthiness, and the man makes 
his peace with the church of his forbears. This is 
the essential movement of a narrative that has many 
minor features of interest — incisive characteriza- 
tion, descriptive charm, and grave beauty of diction. 
It reaches an end of chastened pathos with the death 
of Dominic, from whom we feel that the friend who 
lives to mourn his memory has won strength and 
purification that will last out her remaining years. 
The Welsh country, with its picturesque scenery, 
its distinctive human type, and its religious emotion- 
alism, is the setting of Mrs. Steel's new novel. A 
Welsh maiden is the heroine, a maiden so unso- 
phisticated that she is afraid of love when it makes 
entrance into her life, and rejects the right man to 
marry the wrong one lest by yielding to the former's 
appeal she shoidd find herself loving him too much 
for her peace of mind. It makes a curiously unreal 
complication, and ends in a subdued sort of tragedy. 
The two men, one a poor bank clerk, the other a 
wealthy aristocrat, are thrown together by accident 
in the first chapter, and discover that they bear the 
same name, although in no way related. This 
chance bond of union leads to an intimate associa- 
tion, which even outlives their rivalry for Aura's 
hand. The rich man has the nobler soiJ, and his 
poor namesake is poorer in character than in worldly 
possessions. But the irony of fate, coupled with the

girl's idiosyncrasy, wins the prize for the unworthy 
aspirant, and nothing is left his rival but to die 
gracefully and poetically in the last chapter. The 
irony of the situation finds expression in the title, 
" A Sovereign Remedy," for in this case his wealth 
proves anything but a sovereign remedy for the 
hero's disease. Mrs. Steel is so wise a woman and so 
admirable a writer that her work always gives 
pleasure of a refined sort, but the present story offers 
only a pale reflection of the power displayed in her 
novels of Indian life. 

Mrs. Henry Dudeney's portrayal of rustic scenes 
and characters are suggestive of the best work of 
George Eliot and Mr. Hardy, and are ftot unworthy 
to be compared with those prototypes. This praise, 
high as it is, seems to us fairly earned by two or 
three of her books, and by none more fully than by 
"The Battle of the Weak." In this strong and 
beautiful narrative, moreover, we find the quality of 
charm, which was somehow lacking in the earlier 
novels, and which was much needed to relieve the 
sombreness of their cast. The scene is Gossips 
Green, a village on the Cornish coast ; the time is 
that of the Napoleonic wars. On a wild night of 
1790, a Frenchwoman is cast ashore from a wrecked 
ship, and lives just long enough to give birth to the 
child who is the hero of the narrative. A year or 
more later, the union of a retired soldier with a 
schoolmistress results in the birth of a girl. These 
two, the boy whimsically named Quaker Jay, the 
girl baptized as Lucy Bertram, are destined for one 
another in the end, but not until much suffering has 
chastened both their lives. We now pass lightly 
over a score of years, and find Quaker a mad, 
irresponsible youth, the puzzle and scandal of the 
village, spectacular and vivid in his every act, a 
strange compound of recklessness and poetical mysti- 
cism, resulting from the blending of unrevealed 
ancestral strains. Meanwhile, Lucy, conventionally 
nurtured, becomes the wife of the village physician, 
a victim of self-repression, and a creature whose 
life is measured by rule and precept. It is a case 
of tragical mismating, for her every instinct turns 
toward Quaker, whose eyes have pursued her with 
adoring gaze from the time when they first fell 
upon her. How she struggles with the surging pas- 
sion, and how it fails to subdue her even upon a 
critical occasion in which the sentimental novelist 
would find ample warrant for her yielding, is subtly 
and powerfully set before us. Mrs. Dudeney shows 
us how this most delicate of themes may be handled 
with perfect sincerity, yet without a trace of impure 
suggestion. She has written a story of truly wonder- 
ful beauty, commingled with tragic pathos and quaint 
humor, a book over which the storm cloud of tragedy 
hangs, yet which ends with the serenity of sunset 
peace. 

" The Lonely Lady of Grosvenor Square " is Mrs. 
Henry de la Pasture's latest novel. It is a delicate 
piece of work, quietly and charmingly sentimental, 
but with little of the sparkle and animation of " The 
Man from America." It tells of a modest country 



girl, transplanted to the London palace in which a 
wealthy aunt, long estranged from her kinspeople, 
is lying in her last illness. Death claims its own, 
and the girl is surprised to learn that her brother 
(a soldier in Africa) has been made the legatee of 
his aunt's possessions. In her brother's absence she 
naturally takes charge, and tries to fit herself into 
her new conditions. A neighboring Duke, distantly 
related, helps to smooth away her difficvdties, and 
romance soon appears upon the scene. Then comes 
news of the brother's death in some far-off war, and 
with it the knowledge that he had been secretly 
married, leaving a widow and a chUd. This throws 
doubt upon her interest in the property, which does 
not make a bit of difference to her lover, but greatly 
agitates his worldly-minded mother. Presently the 
widow, a Frenchwoman, appears upon the scene, 
and proves to be a very satisfactory sort of relative. 
She insists upon a division of the property, and all 
ends happily. This is a book of manners and sen- 
timents ; it touches only the surface of life, but 
it is agreeably written and proves mildly enter- 
taining. 

Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson has recently written 
two stories for our entertainment, both highly inter- 
esting, although in very different ways. One is " A 
Midsummer Day's Dream," being a fantastic comedy 
of an • English country house party ; the other is 
" The Privateers," being an exciting tale of intrigue, 
adventui-e, and hairbreadth escape. The first of these 
books brings us into the company of a pleasant 
group of people who are preparing for an amateur 
performance of " A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
The hero, who makes a belated appearance while 
the rehearsals are in progress, catches a brief glimpse 
of a nymph fleeing through the park, and retains as 
a trophy a shoe that she has shed in her flight. The 
rest of the story tells of his efforts to pick out his 
Cinderella from the bevy of young women who are 
members of the house party. His tactics are of 
such a nature that the other men of the party, driven 
to exasperation, wait upon him one morning with a 
categorical demand. They want to know whether 
he has designs on all the girls in the house. After 
being misled by several false clews, he at last dis- 
covers the object of his quest, and the consequences 
are what we have a right to expect. The vein of 
light and fanciful comedy in which this story is 
written makes of it a charming piece of work. 

" The Privateers," on the other hand, is dis- 
tinctly melodramatic. It is concerned with the 
rivalry of two American speculators for the posses- 
sion of a young Englishwoman who, unknown to 
herself, is the heiress to the controlling interest in a 
certain American railroad. She is abducted from 
her home on the Isle of Wight, and carried to 
Brittany on a private yacht. The hero is a gallant 
and resourceful British naval officer, who allies him- 
self first with one rival and then with the other, and 
finally rescues the distressed damsel from both. It 
is a merry game of hide and seek, played all along 
the Breton and Cornish coasts, and has enough des-

perate situations to stock two or three ordinary 
romances. We cannot say very much for Mr. Wat- 
son's Americans. Their acts and their words are 
reflections of an Englishman's fertile imagination 
rather than products of observation — unless it be 
observation of American manners as depicted on the 
English melodramatic stage. 

In "The Amulet" Miss Murfree has again made 
use of her extensive knowledge of the history of 
Tennessee, the period being that of the close of the 
Seven Years' War. The scene is the British out- 
post of Fort Prince George, on the eastern edge of 
the Cherokee country, where a small garrison is beset 
by its Indian foes, who are cowed but not subdued, 
and whose treacherous character means the possi- 
bility of surprise and massacre. The commander, 
his querulous sister, his beautiful daughter, and two 
young officers who are aspirants for her hand, are 
the characters of this historical romance, which is 
a rather sketchy bit of work on the whole, although 
it evinces & close acquaintance with Cherokee lore. 
Dramatically, the story leads up to an expedition to 
the sacred town of Chot^, for the purpose of seizing 
certain cannon which the Indians have kept in vio- 
lation of their treaty agreement; sentimentally, it 
declares for the courageous leader of this expedition 
and the corresponding discomfiture of his fatuous 
rival. Touches of poetic description are frequent in 
adornment of the narrative, for in this respect Miss 
Murfree's hand has not lost its cunning, but other- 
wise the book falls far below the high standard set 
in her earlier writings. 

" Romance Island " exists in the fourth dimen- 
sion, which is the reason why it is not found upon 
the map. Its inhabitants are descended from Hiram, 
Prince of Tyre, and their civilization is far superior 
to ours in most respects. An American has found 
his way to them and become their king, which does 
not at all suit the ambitions of the native Prince 
Tabnit, who presently finds a convenient way in 
which to dispose of the alien usurper. Thereupon 
Tabnit embarks upon a submarine and goes to New 
York, where the story opens after the events above 
related have all occurred. We are now introduced 
to the heroine, the daughter of the dispossessed 
king. Tabnit falls in love with her, abducts her, 
and bears her to the island with the intention of 
making her his bride. Now the hero, who is a New 
York newspaper reporter, has also fallen in love 
with her, and when she disappears, fits out an expe- 
dition in pursuit of her. His yacht successfully 
negotiates the difficulties of the fourth dimension, 
and lands its party on the mysterious island. From 
this point on, all is extravaganza. The writer lets 
her imagination run riot, but contrives to be enter- 
taining — save for a tendency to indulge in prolix 
description — until the climax is reached in the 
restoration of the king, the effacement of his wicked 
rival, and the triumphant rescue of the maiden, 
followed by her restoration to the world of prose ; 
that is, to as prosaic a world as lovers are supposed 



to inhabit. Miss Gale has a pretty fancy, a manner 
of marked originality, and the trick of making a 
deft use of bits of literary, scientific, and archaeo- 
logical information. 

Poe would have opened his eyes wide had he 
foreseen, among the progeny of " The Gold Bug," 
such a yarn as " The Treasure of Peyre Gaillard." 
The analytical process which that pioneer in the 
tale of mystery applied to the location of the spot 
where his hoard lay buried was simplicity itself in 
comparison with the method whereby the hidden 
treasure is discovered in the present ingenious nar- 
rative. As a matter of fact Mr. Bennett overdoes 
the thing by too much subtlety, and by an appara- 
tus of documents which makes unconscionable de- 
mands upon the attention of his readers. Long 
before the end is reached, the reader becomes wearied 
with so great a complication, gives up his attempt 
to follow the clue, and is content to abridge the 
argument that he may the more speedily come to 
its conclusion. The scene of the story is a South 
Carolina plantation, whose owner is so impoverished 
that he is on the verge of desperation ; under these 
circumstances the discovery of the treasure becomes 
a necessity of the situation, of which fact we are so 
well assured that we grow careless in tracing the 
logical development of the search for it. The style 
of the story offers a curious blend of romantic 
glamour with realistic description ; at one moment 
we are rhapsodizing over the beauties of nature, and 
at the next we are engrossed by a mass of prosaic 
detail. When the treasure is unearthed and disposed 
of, it brings close upon two millions of dollars, which 
sum is carefully itemized lest some lingering trace 
of incredulity should mar our unqualified acceptance 
of so satisfactory a total. 

The romantic and tragic history of certain mem- 
bers of the Imperial House of Austria has provided 
Mr. Meredith Nicholson with the basic material for 
his " Port of Missing Men." It is only by way of 
suggestion, however, for an attempt to identify his 
characters with actual Archdukes would be unprofit- 
able. It seems that' a possible heir to the throne 
has disappeared somewhere in America, and that the 
succession must remain unsettled until it is deter- 
mined whether he be alive or dead. Meanwhile, a 
gang of scoundrels are intriguing in behalf of another 
claimant, for whom they are smoothing the way by 
a series of ingenious assassinations. The key to 
the mystery is in the possession of an expatriated 
Austrian who has become an American, and is 
known as John Armitage. He has the evidence of 
the lost Archduke's demise, but does not care to play 
into the hands of the conspirators by revealing it. 
The scene of the tale is first set in Geneva, but is 
soon transferred to Virginia, where the plot, which 
has been steadily thickening, comes to an exciting 
finish. A high-spirited American girl is the heroine, 
and the hero, after routing the conspirators, wins her 
for his bride as a matter of course. The story is 
fashioned after the conventional romantic pattern,

and displays no little skill in both plot and charac- 
terization. 

Corrupt politics and love are the ingredients, the 
former predominating, of Mr. Will Payne's latest 
novel, " When Love Speaks." The love interest is 
of the homely everyday sort, to be paralleled in the 
annals of a million homes ; the political interest is 
similar to that which a close study of thousands of 
American communities would disclose. The scene is 
a city of Western Michigan, in which a zealous dis- 
trict attorney conducts a desperate campaign against 
corruption, and ends by discovering that the forces 
of evil are too powerful for him to cope with. This 
disheartening conclusion is somewhat relieved by the 
outcome of the story upon its sentimental side, when 
husband and wife, estranged by their diffei'ing points 
of view, learn the lesson that instinct is a better guide 
than reason in the affairs of the heart. The in- 
junction implicit in the novelist's treatment of his 
theme seems to be that we should take the world as 
we find it, with its mingling of evil motives with 
good, and not hope to eliminate the evil all at once. 
It is a counsel of practical wisdom, no doubt, but it 
seems to us also to have a tinge of despair. Probably 
he makes a little too much of the soul of good in 
things evil, finding too ready an excuse for com- 
promise with wrong, and allowing indignation to 
cool when it were better to keep it white-hot. At 
all events, he has worked in a spirit of absolute 
realism, and made a searching analysis of the meth- 
ods of the political corruptionist. Truthfulness 
rather than idealism is the note of the book, although 
it has latent idealism a-plenty, and " Pardon 's the 
word for all " would be a more closely descriptive 
Shakespearean motto than the one which actually 
adorns the title-page. 

In " The Charlatans " Mr. Bert Leston Taylor has 
given us a clever sketch of musical student life in a 
large city. The city may with no great difficulty 
be recognized as Chicago, and the Colossus — other- 
wise known as the Grindstone — may possibly 
suggest to some readers a particular institution in 
which music has been successfully commercialized 
for many years. To this hive of industry a young 
girl from the country finds her way, under the delu- 
sion that it is a focus of musical culture. Since she 
has the true artistic endowment, she soon discovers 
that the work of the Grindstone bears no relation to 
music in any real sense, that its ways are those of 
charlatanism and its spirit that of the philistine. 
She slowly gropes her way toward the light, and 
a promising artistic future seems to lie before her, 
when the mischief-maker Love enters upon the scene, 
and makes music seem a matter of minor importance. 
What eventually becomes of her is not revealed, since 
the writer leaves her hand in hand with the fairy 
prince by the brookside. But we may still surmise 
that she became a respectable amateur. Mr. Taylor's 
touch is everywhere light and pleasing ; he has the 
gift of gentle social satire and the trick of clever 
dialogue. William Morton Payne. 



Briefs on New Books. 



Readers of Thk Dial need no intro- 
In^Sl'to.. d"«ti«n to Mr. Walter Taylor Field, 

several of whose papers on books for 
children have appeared in its pages. These chap- 
ters and some additional ones on the same subject 
are now published in book form under the title, 
''Fingerposts to Children's Reading" (McClurg). 
Books are living and breathing companions to their 
eager juvenile readers, Mr. Field well urges, and 
hence the care needed in their selection. Their 
influence is both moral and aesthetic, and the two 
are not so very widely separated. Nor is there any 
useful distinction between boys' books and girls' 
books : if both are real literature, they will interest 
both sexes. Fairy tales receive a warm word of 
praise. The excess of periodical literature, most of 
it of little worth, read by children is deplored, and 
the formation of good libraries in family, school, 
and Sunday school, is strongly recommended. 
Chapters on reading in school, on supplementary 
reading, on the public library, on the illustrating of 
children's books, and on Mother Goose, acceptably 
fill out the volume. A fifty-page list of young 
people's books, with indication of the school grade 
or gi'ades in which each work should be read, forms 
an appendix. To an older person the list seems 
lacking in many a fondly remembered favorite of 
childhood ; but, unless the catalogue were to be of 
undesirable length, this is inevitable. One criticism 
of a general nature : the child in the author's mind's 
eye would seem to be rather precocious or priggish, 
or both. Can the ordinary child enjoy Shakespeare 
in the original at nine or ten, even in the few plays 
named? or the "Essays of Elia" and Thoreau's 
"Walden" at fourteen or fifteen? or Miss Edge- 
worth's " Parent's Assistant " at any age ? The 
reviewer's experience strongly inclines him to say 
no, especially in the matter of Miss Edgeworth. 
And although Emerson's essays. Pastor Wagner's 
"Simple Life," Carlyle's "Sartor Resartus," and 
Lowell's prose works look well on the school library's 
shelves, and by the mere displays of their lettered 
backs exert an educational influence, is any scholar, 
even in the high school, qualified to get that benefit 
from them that he might from reading other books 
more surely within his mental grasp ? " Sartor " 
might well give him a dislike for its author which 
he would never overcome. Mr. Field's book is 
attractive in form and carefully printed, — although 
" Clark : Self -Culture " is an inaccurate entry for 
James Freeman Clarke's excellent work on that 

subject.

tions of certain of the factors of evolution that there 
has been great need of a critical review of the data. 
Professor Thomas Hunt Morgan, recently appointed 
to the chair of Experimental Zoology in Columbia 
University, has rendered this service to American 
biologists in his "Experimental Zoology" (Mac- 
millan). The author takes up the experimental 
study of evolution, discussing the influence of exter- 
nal conditions in causing changes in the structure of 
animals but denying in the main that such changes 
are normally inherited. He likewise decides against 
the probable inheritance of mutations, and of the 
effects of use and disuse, and dismisses the supposed 
phenomenon of telegony as a breeders' myth. The 
inheritance of disease through the mother is indi- 
cated by some recent experimental evidence, but 
demands more critical evidence. The rediscovery 
in recent years of Mendel's law of hybridization 
has given great stimulus to the scientific study of 
animal and plant breeding and unlocked not a few 
secrets of heredity. The possibility of the experi- 
mental development of new races of jlomesticated 
animals, races moreover of fixed and stable types, 
is firmly established. The unsolved riddles in this 
new field are still many and perplexing, as the 
reader will soon discover who attempts to thread the 
maze of " heterozygotes and extracted recessives." 
This phase of the experimental field is evidently 
still in too raw a state for a well-digested summary. 
The discoveries of De Vries of the origin of new 
species of evening primrose by saltatory variation or 
mutation, as he designates it, has raised anew the 
whole question of the potency and scope of natural 
selection in evolution, and compels a new examina- 
tion of variation in its relation to the origin of 
species and the progress of organic differentiation. 
According to the mutation theory of De Vries, na- 
tural selection destroys species, it does not originate 
them. The experimental study of the determina- 
tion of sex has as yet brought forward no satisfying 
evidence that external factors in any way control 
the sex of offspring. On the other hand, much of 
the recent work in cytology and experimental breed- 
ing points to the probability that sex is predeter- 
mined in the union of the sex cells. An excellent 
summary of the recent literature on the various 
phases of this problem is found in these pages. The 
novelty of the field covered in this work and the 
very fundamental bearings of the data and hypo- 
theses here gathered in a critical summary combine 
to make Professor Morgan's work indispensable to 
anyone who wishes critical information of recent 
movements in the biological world. 

Studies m There appeared in the pages of 

fiowerg for the "The Studio" some seven or eight 
art student. years ago, two ob three studies of 

flowers in flat tones by Miss J. Foord, which at- 
tracted attention at once by their unusual artistic 
quality and marked individuality of treatment. The 
skilful placing upon the page and the fine feeling for 
decorative arrangement put them in a class by them- 



selves. These were the forerunners of the series 
which was published in a folio by Mr. B. T. Batsf ord 
of London, in 1904. The success of the book was 
immediate and well-deserved. Moved by its favor- 
able reception the author has been led to prepare 
a second series of " Decorative Plant and Flower 
Studies" (imported by Scribner) that are in some 
respects even more successful than the former. 
Though intended primarily for artists and designers, 
the beauty of the plates makes the volume one to 
be enjoyed for its aesthetic quality alone. The 
studies, forty in number, are reproduced in color 
by a French stencil process that has yielded most 
charming results. These are supplemented by an 
equal number of full-page drawings in outline, giv- 
ing details of growth and structure, and also by a 
set of smaller ones that convey the spirit and effect 
of each plant as a whole. Miss Foord's draughts- 
manship sets a notable standard in its combination 
of force with delicacy. Her vigorous renderings 
show most clearly tliat flowers have greater possi- 
bilities for the artist than are commonly recognized. 
Especially in the representation of fragile plants like 
the barley and the flowering rush does she furnish 
effective object lessons. These, as she clearly dem- 
onstrates, have in their own way no less strength 
than more majestic members of the floral tribe, such 
as the marrow or the hollyhock. It is entirely a 
matter of treatment — in this as in everything else. 
Students using this book should not overlook Miss 
Foord's comments upon the plants depicted ; her 
words are very much to the point and emphasize the 
lessons taught by the drawings. 

Mr. H. Maynard Smith will, without 
fiianmallr. question, be pleased to have his little 

book of essays, " In Playtime " ( Ox- 
ford : B. H. Blackwell) commended as suggesting 
more than once the genially autobiographic manner 
and the frolic playfulness of the master essayist in 
this kind, whom we do not need to name. Yet, born 
of the Elian spirit though he manifestly is, the 
author appears to be in error in one small particular 
concerning Lamb's habits. "Charles Lamb," he 
tells us, " earned the gratitude of John Company 
and a pension by what he wrote in Mincing Lane ; 
but he earned the gratitude of a nation by what he 
wrote at his own fireside." On the contrary, the 
tradition (and in part the authentic history) is that 
Lamb did not hold his nose to his ledger all through 
office hours, but dashed off many a letter or squib 
or essay as he sat perched on that lofty stool, osten- 
sibly engaged in furthering the interests of John 
Company. Such truancy of his quill was admirably 
in keeping with his well-known answer to an official 
rebuke for coming late in the morning. " Well, 
you see, I make up for it by going early," was the 
bland excuse. Like Lamb, Mr. Smith is a bachelor ; 
but (or hence) he delivers himself freely of advice 
to parents ; and like Lamb, again, he can write well 
on the subject of letter-writing. But in saying, 
incidentally, that Mrs. Kemble made it a rule to

have her letters equal her correspondent's in length, 
he is slightly in error. That lady's rule was even 
more peculiar : she insisted on sending back the 
same amount of stationery as she received, whether 
written on or not. These light and quickly-read 
chapters, which have already had periodical publi- 
cation, equal the muses in number, and the gi'aces 
in general variety of subject matter, — two chapters 
dealing with English literature ( Sliakespeare and 
Scott), four with some branch or aspect of the 
author's art, and two with affairs of daily life. 

The worthy and interesting contri- 
Thepsvcholofw ^ ^i f ^ J p-j^^ t the dis- 
of races. . i i • i 

cussion of the psychological explana- 
tion of racial traits finds a lucid translation at the 
hands of Florence Wade-Evans, the work appearing 
under the title " Race Prejudice " (Dutton). It is 
amongst the contemporary French thinkers that this 
problem of the psychological equations of races has 
reached most definite expression. From their sev- 
eral points of view M. Boutmy, M. Fouillife, M. 
Le Bon, and others have set forth, at times clini- 
cally, at times more academically, their analyses of 
the constituent traits, temperament, reaction to 
milieu, nature, and nurture of the European races. 
Parallel with the American discovery that Boston 
is a state of mind, they have determined that France 
and Germany and England and the rest are likewise 
states of mind. They have then proceeded to indi- 
cate how little intercommunicable these states of 
mind really are. M. Finot comes into the camp 
with a conspicuous chip on his shoulder. He main- 
tains that the differences of races have been much 
over-rated, and that the doctrine of superior and 
average and inferior races has little to stand upon. 
He surveys the evidence from craniology and brain 
structure, from archaeology, and historical achieve- 
ment, and decides that vicissitudes and opportunity, 
education and an upward sweep on a rising wave 
have been the dominant causes of seeming suprem- 
acy. He argues for a scientific equality of mankind 
and a practical disappearance of race prejudice. It 
is important to have this side of the question well 
advanced and to realize that much of the evidence 
— notably the anthropological — has been prejudi- 
cially gathered ; yet the net impression of the vol- 
ume is that of an able but somewhat too zealous 
special pleading for a cause that certainly makes a 
philanthropic appeal. It is to be expected that M. 
Finot's most difficult " case " is that of the negro in 
America ; his treatment of this incident distinctly 
lacks the seal of proof. 



The latest 
recipe for 
success. 



Manuals teaching the art of success 
will find readers as long as there are 
so many persons doomed to failure 
in the struggle for supremacy, and even for bare 
existence ; and since this struggle is daily becoming 
sharper, such books ought to be more and more in 
demand. The latest of the series is Dr. Emil 
Reich's " Success in Life " ( Duffield) , a sort of com- 



panion volume to the same author's " Success among 
Nations." A carefully excogitated list of the con- 
stants and variables of success gives the treatise 
somewhat the same illusive appearance of mathemati- 
cal infallibility as marks the philosophical writings 
of Descartes and Spinoza. Yet in spite of this ill- 
advised plan of constructing a mathematical frame- 
work on which to fashion a body of doctrine dealing 
with the most unmathematical of subjects, the book 
is so fresh, so unconventional, so ingenious, and so 
suggestive, that its weaknesses and imperfections 
do not need to plead very hard for forgiveness. As 
a foreigner (a Hungarian) in England, the author 
writes understandingly and admirably on the advan- 
tages of the quick-witted alien's position, though 
unfortunately not all immigi-ants are so brilliantly 
versatile as Dr. Reich. None the less forceful for 
that, however, is his exhortation to get out of the 
ruts, to distrust convention, to seek an opening that 
not all the world is striving to crowd into, if we would 
succeed. Toward the end of the volume, especially 
in the chajjf.ers on special vocations, there is an 
apparent assumption of omniscience that repels, as 
does also, thi-oughout, a tendency to exaggerate and 
to make sweeping assertions. For instance, in treat- 
ing of success as a physician, the writer (whose 
doctorate, we believe, is not in medicine) inciden- 
tally remarks : ''It is no exaggeration to say that 
there is scarcely an American who does not carry 
from one to six different sorts of patent pills con- 
stantly in his pockets." In general, it is of course 
a material and tangible and speedy success that our 
pushful author-lecturer holds up to admiration, 
rather than that unrecognized and unapplauded and 
late-won spiritual victory which alone really mat- 
ters. In point of style Dr. Reich might advantage- 
ously practice some of the English mutisme which 
he holds in so slight esteem. He has the readiness, 
not to say looseness, of the fluent talker and lecturer, 
but little of the exactness, the terseness, the fine re- 
serve of the scholarly and painstaking writer. 

In the preface to his volume on 
' ' European Enam els " ( Putnam ) , 
Mr. Henry H. Cunynghame, C. B., 
adroitly essays to disarm criticism of his very im- 
perfect book by advancing as an excuse for its 
shortcomings that " so few regular treatises have 
been written" on the subject. But this seems no 
reason at all ; for the untilled field gave Mr. Cun- 
ynghame the rare opportunity to sink his plough 
deep into the virgin soil and turn up rich furrows 
of new material that should produce an abundant 
yield of interest and of value. Of course if he 
desired merely to compile a book from ready-made 
sources, he may not have foimd the material easy 
at his hand, — although we know of several works, 
treating wholly or in part of enamels, that he has 
evidently made no use of. The result is a book that 
will not stand the test of criticism ; and therefore, 
accepting the author's cry of peccavi, we will say 
in a few words what he has done without comment 



The art of 
enamelling 
in Europe. 



1907.]

upon how he has done it. In the introduction he 
tells what enamels are, their different kinds and 
methods, the colors that are used and how they are 
used, and much technical information of which he 
has knowledge from some practice in an amateurish 
way. He then gives a slight survey of the art in 
ancient times, of Gaulish enamelling in Europe after 
the Christian era, of the remarkable Byzantium 
enamels, of the mediaeval work of the Carlovingian 
period and up to the fourteenth century, of basse- 
taille or bas-relief enamels, of painted enamels 
which, having their origin in the fourteenth century 
and brought to great perfection in the two following 
centuries, are the most beautiful, the most artistic, 
and the most interesting of all enamels, and worthy 
of a special volume devoted alone to their history 
and art. Then with some pages on snuff-boxes, 
Battersea enamels, and enamelled jewelry, we reach 
the closing chapter on modern enamels. The vol- 
ume is illustrated with four color plates and fifty- 
seven process reproductions, and presents the same 
attractive appearance of preceding volumes in " The 
Connoisseur's Library." 

Mr. Thomas R. Slicer's little book 
f .aSrr entitled " The Way to Happiness " 

(Macmillan) teaches convincingly 
that happiness comes through our activities, not 
through our passivities, and through living to the 
spirit rather than to the flesh. After pointing out 
that the search for happiness is natural and univer- 
sal, and that " it is a law of nature that its unimpeded, 
undiverted, unsophisticated functions are functions 
of delight," the author briefly reviews the erro- 
neous or defective schemes of happiness devised by 
Cynics, Stoics, and Epicureans, and then advances 
to a consideration of the happiness that comes 
through altruism, worship, spiritual freedom, obe- 
dience to the heavenly vision, and, finally, blessed- 
ness and peace. Worry and sin are named as the 
two disturbing elements to our peace, and as they 
cannot be mended they must be abolished — a 
counsel of perfection. Mr. Slicer's well-known 
fondness for Browning comes out repeatedly in 
quotation or reference, and very effectively. He 
ends with the seasonable, the almost ine-vitable, ex- 
hortation to "live the wholesome, natural, simple 
life as far as, in these complicated times, we can "; 
and the natural life, as before remarked, is the joy- 
fid life, all whose functions are functions of delight. 

The xtory "^ thousand years ago arctic explora- 

of Arctic tion began on a small scale, piratical 

exploration. Norsemen in search of plunder being 
the distant forerunners of Peary and Louis Amadeus, 
Duke of the Abruzzi. But practically all our knowl- 
edge of arctic regions has been gained during the 
past three centuries, from the days of Henry Hudson 
onward, and especially during the past one hundred 
years. In thirty-three short and readable chapters 
Mr. G. Douglas Hoare gives a succinct account of 
the sufferings and achievements of the heroic men 



who have braved the terrors of cold, storm, and 
darkness, which fall to the lot of all who seek to 
discover the secrets of earth's most desolate domain. 
The successive expeditions of Sir John Franklin are 
detailed with the fulness which their dramatic in- 
terest justifies, and accounts of the searching parties 
are given. Elisha Kent Kane appears to have been 
the first American to take any prominent part in 
polar inquiry ; though ostensibly sent out to search 
for Franklin, he devoted his efforts to regions where 
" there was no possibility of finding traces of the 
missing explorers." The voyages of Hall, whilom 
editor of the Cincinnati " Daily Penny Press," and 
his sudden and tragic death are briefly treated. 
Later explorers, such as Nares, Greeley, Nordenski- 
Old, De Long, Nansen, Peary, and Andr^e all re- 
ceive due attention ; even Wellman's scheme for an 
aerial trip is mentioned. On the whole the author 
has given a very satisfactory bird's-eye view of his 
subject. The book is illustrated with some twenty 
full-page plates, and closes with a fine large folding 
map which shows at a glance the very respectable 
amount of geographical knowledge that has been 
won in the Arctic circle. There is, however, a tract 
of two million square miles about the pole which is 
stiU a mystery. (Dutton.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The first lecture on the Leslie Stephen Foundation 
was given at Cambridge on Washington's birthday of 
this year. The lecturer was Professor Walter Raleigh, 
who appropriately took for his subject Samuel Johnson, 
also the subject of Stephen's best biography. The lect- 
ure is now issued by Henry Frowde in pamphlet form. 

The new " Knutsford " edition of the writings of 
Mrs. Gaskell is edited by Dr. A. W. Ward, who has 
been assisted by the daughters of the novelist. There 
are eight volumes altogether, of which the following 
five are now sent us : " North and South," " My Lady 
Ludlow," " Sylvia's Lovers," " Cousin Phillis," and 
" Wives and Daiightei's." Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons 
are the publishers. 

Mr. Robert W. Moore's " German Literature " has 
recently been issued in a sixth edition by the University 
Press, Hamilton, N. Y. The steady demand for this 
popular manual is shown by the appearance of one edi- 
tion after another in rapid succession. In the present 
revision the author has taken the opportunity to bring 
the work up to date by enlarging the final chapters 
dealmg with the latest work of Sudermann and Haupt- 
mann. Several fme illustrations have been added. 

Volumes representing the work in draughtsmanship 
of Gainsborough and Leonardo da Vinci have been 
added to the series entitled "Drawings of the Great 
Masters," imported by the Messrs. Scribner. There 
are upwards of forty reproductions in each volume, 
printed in various tints, with a number mounted on 
dark-colored backgrounds. Lord Sutherland Gower 
contributes a brief introduction to the Gainsborough 
volume, while Mr. C. Lewis Hinds writes at more 
length regarding Leonardo's drawings. — Exactly similar 
in form is " The Great Etchers " series, in which has 



232 



THE DIAL 



[AprU 1, 



just appeared "The Etchings of William Strang, 
A. R. A.," with an introduction by Mr. Frank Newbolt. 
Though often repulsive in subject, Mr. Strang's work is 
always distinguished, and on the whole well worthy of 
representation in a series devoted to the world's master 
etchers. 

Mr. Tudor Jenks is going on with his series of pop- 
ular books about the lives and times of the great En- 
glish writers. " In the Days of Goldsmith " is the latest 
addition to the list which already comprises also the 
names of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Scott. 
These books, which made capital reading for young 
people, are published by Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. 

The " History and Travel " section of the " Classified 
Catalogue of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh " 
should prove a helpful adjunct to the resources of the 
library, on account of the annotation which is its char- 
acteristic feature. By this same token, students of 
history everywhere will find it useful for guidance in 
he selection of their reading. Librarianship is perform- 
ing its highest function when engaged in the preparation 
of catalogues of this type. 

Theodore Beza's " Abraham Sacriiiant," done into 
English as " A Tragedie of Abraham's Sacrifice " by 
Arthur Golding, and edited by Dr. Malcom W. Wallace, 
is a handsome publication of the University of Toronto 
Library. The original (here reprinted in an appendix) 
dates from 1552, and the translation from 1575. The 
editorial introduction and notes are very elaborate, and 
the publication is highly creditable to the scholarship 
of the university whence it issues. 

To their excellent series known as " Newnes' Art 
Library " Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co. have recently 
added volumes dealing with Delacroix, Ligres, Michael 
Angelo, Correggio, and Burne-Jones. Besides a fron- 
tispiece in photogravure, each volume contains from 
fifty to sixty large sized half-tone reproductions, a bio- 
graphical and critical introduction by some writer of 
authority, and (in most of the volumes) a list of works. 
Another series of the same publishers, and published 
in uniform make-up, is the " Representative Art of 
European Galleries," to which has just been added two 
volumes covering the National Gallery of London. 

The two volumes of Mr. J. H. Balfour Browne's 
" Essays Critical and Political," published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co., have now a somewhat old- 
fashioned flavor, since the papers bear dates in the 
seventies and eighties. The single exception to this 
statement is " The Coming Revolution," written only 
last year. Among the subjects discussed in the " Criti- 
cal " volume are Michael Angelo and Machiavelli, 
Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot, Landor, Dickens, 
Macready, and Henry Fawcett. The " Political " vol- 
ume is too far outdated to have any particular value in 
this twentieth century. 

Mr. Arthur Gray Butler, an English minor poet of dis- 
tinction and considerable achievement, wrote " Harold : 
A Drama m Four Acts " over thirty years ago. It was 
based, like Tennyson's " Harold " of the same decade, 
upon Bulwer's novel, but was withheld from publica- 
tion until 1892. It now appears in a second edition, a, 
publication of Mr. Henry Frowde. It has been largely 
remodelled, and this with special reference to a possible 
stage performance, which we trust it may secure, for 
its diction is fairly level with the height of its noble 
theme, and that theme is one of the most dramatic that 
English history offers to the stage. 



Notes. 



Hawthorne's immortal " Tanglewood Tales," edited 
by Mr. Robert H. Beggs, are now published as a 
" Pocket Classic " by the Macmillan Co. 

" Much Adoe about Nothing " is the latest volume in 
the " First Folio " Shakespeare, edited by the Misses 
Porter and Clarke, and published by the Messrs. Crowell. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are also in the field, now 
that the vogue of Mr. A. C. Benson is at its height, 
with a new edition of the " Memoirs of Arthur Hamil- 
ton, B. A.," his first book, now twenty years old. 

" An Introduction to the Study of Browning," by 
Mr. Arthur Symons, long favorably known to students 
of the poet, now comes to us in a new edition, with 
additions, published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

A volume dealing with the economic development of 
the Negro in the South, by Mr. Booker T. Washington 
and Professor W. E. Burghardt DuBois, is an impor- 
tant announcement of Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. 

Dr. Courtney Stanhope Kenny's " Outlines of Criminal 
Law," a work published in England five years ago, is 
now revised and adapted for American scholars by Mr. 
James H. Webb, and published by the Macmillan Co. 

A fourth edition, embodying a number of additional 
literary references and notes, of Professor James Mark 
Baldwin's "Social and Ethical Interpretations in 
Mental Development" has been issued by the Macmillan 
Company. 

A condensed version of Mr. Lionel Cast's exhaustive 
treatise on the life and works of Anthony Van Dyck, 
published in 1900, has been prepared by the author, 
and is now issued in Macmillan's series of "Great 
Masters in Painting and Sculptiu-e." 

The two volumes of Sir James Stephen's "Essays in 
Ecclesiastical Biography " are now reprinted by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. in their " Silver Library," with 
a prefatory note by Mr. Herbert Stephen, the author's 
grandson. The original edition has 1849 for its date. 

A new edition of Mr. George Clausen's " Six Lectures 
on Painting " is published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. From the same house we have also a new work 
by Mr. Clausen, " Aims and Ideals in Art," being the 
substance of a course of lectures given a year or two ago. 

" The Missions of California and the Old Southwest," 
by Mr. Jesse S. Hildrup, is an oblong octavo of text 
and pictures illustrating in attractive manner the dis- 
tinctive type of Spanish reUgious architecture in Am- 
erica. The book is published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co. 

To the " Country Life Education Series " of Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. there has been added a volume on " Types 
and Breeds of Farm Animals," by Professor Charles S. 
Plumb. It is abimdantly illustrated, and will be wel- 
comed both by stock-raisers and by students in agri- 
cultural colleges. 

" The Interpretation of Scripture and Other Essays," 
by Benjamin Jowett, is a volume of the " London 
Library," published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 
The papers reprinted date back to the "Essays and 
Reviews " period. Leslie Stephen's essay on Jowett's 
life appropriately prefaces the collection. 

A small volume of " Essays on English Studies," by 
the late Henry Norman Hudson, is edited by Dr. A. J. 
George, and published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The 
essays are mostly upon Shakespearean subjects (as 



1907.]

would be expected), but one notable exception is offered 
by the paper on Daniel Webster, written for the hun- 
dredth anniversary of the birth (not the death, as here 
stated) of that great orator. 

" Literature and Life in School " is the title of a 
little book by Miss J. Rose Colby, published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It is the work of a practical 
teacher of English literature, and is mainly concerned 
with the needs of the elementary schools. An appendix 
provides extensive graded lists of books and selections 
for school uses. 

Among the spring announcements of the American 
Baptist Publication Society are the following: "Odds 
and Ends from Pagoda Land," by W. C. Griggs, M. D.; 
" Baptist and Congregational Pioneers," by Rev. J. H. 
Shakespeare ; "The Self-Effacement of Malachi Joseph," 
by Dr. Everett T. Tomlinson ; and " The Church at 
Libertyville," by Rev. J. W. Coidey. 

The spring announcement list of the Grafton Press, 
which reached us too late for entry in our last issue, 
includes the following books: " In Olde Massachusetts," 
by Charles Burr Todd ; " Autobiography and Essays of 
Hermann Krusi, A.M.," edited by F. Elizabeth Ailing; 
"Reminiscences of Richard Lathers"; "St. John 
Genealogy," by Orline St. John Alexander; "Middle- 
town Upper Houses," by Charles G. Adams; "The 
History of Redding, Connecticut," by Charles Burr 
Todd, revised and enlarged edition; " Nephirtis," by 
Seelye W. Little, M.D. 

The ever-increasing interest in St. Francis of Assisi 
and his followers makes pertinent the announcement of 
Messrs Tennant and Ward of New York that they will 
publish early this month "A Short Introduction to 
Franciscan Literature," prepared by Fr. Paschal Rob- 
inson, O. F. M. The aim of the work is to provide a 
brief outline of the early sources of Franciscan history, 
which so often perplex the general reader, and the 
principal works relatmg to the Poverello written since 
the thirteenth century, as well as the enormous literary 
output of the Franciscan movement of the last few 
years. 

We are glad to say a good word for the Con- 
cordance Society, which was organized last December 
at the meeting of the Modern Language Association. 
Its officers are Messrs. Albert S. Cook, Charles G. 
Osgood, Jr., Curtis H. Page, and Charles W. Hodell. 
Its purpose is "to provide subventions toward the 
publication of such concordances and word-indexes to 
English writers as shall be considered sufficiently 
meritorious and necessary, to formulate plans for the 
compilation of such works, and to assist intending com- 
pilers of such works with suggestion and advice." This 
is a highly praiseworthy imdertaking, for we need a 
g^eat many more concordances than are now available, 
and their production is so wearisome and thankless a 
task as to need some special stimulation. It is a kind 
of work that ought to come within the scope of the 
Carnegie Institute, but failing that assistance, the new 
society is doubtless the next best means of getting it 
done. One hmidred members at an annual subscription 
of five dollars each are needed for a start ; unless that 
number is obtained by the first of May, the project will 
be abandoned. Since the printed list already contains 
more than fifty names, we trust the enterprise will not 
die " a-borning." Professor C. H. Page, Columbia Uni- 
versity, is the treasurer, and, as such, will be glad to 
receive subscriptions.

The First of a Series of Biographies of Leading Americans 

Johnston (R. M.): LEADING AMERICAN SOLDIERS 

Washington, Greene, Taylor, Scott, Andrew Jackson, Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, McCleixan, 
Mead, Lee, " Stonewall " Jackson, Joseph E. Johnston. 

By R. M. Johnston, Lecturer in Harvard University. Author of " Napoleon," " The Napoleonic Empire," 
etc. With thirteen portraits. Probable price, $1.75 net. 

The persons treated will be remembered chiefly as soldiers, and as soldiers they are here presented. Their principal 
battles are treated in considerable detail, which makes the book, as a whole, a composite military history from the inter- 
esting: view-point of the dominant personalities. The presentation of tactics is remarkably lucid. Anecdotes that indicate 
personality as effectively as historical performances, are frequent. 

A style at once forceful and charming, a thorough grasp of subject matter, and an enthusiasm for military affairs com- 
bine to make the biographies clear and spirited. 

•»* Other volumes of Leading Americans arranged for are: Scientists (David Starr Jordan) ; Historians (W. P. Trent) ; 
Lawyers (Henry C. Merwin) ; Foets (Curtis Hidden Page) ; Novelists (John Erskine).

" NothinjT in Mr. Snyder's previous work has led us to expect so good a book as this is ; ... he has in this volume 
achieved a real success in a difficult field. No one, except one who has tried to do it, knows how hard it is to make the 
significance and importance of a scientific discovery comprehensible to the layman, and to make it also interesting and 
dramatic, as Mr. Snyder does, is a greater triumph still. ... It is a useful book for the public library, because it gives to the 
general reader more information on the history of science than we can find anywhere else in a readable tona."— Independent. 

"... An historical survey of what was known about the universe by antiquity and what is known now. . . . Written 
with such admirable simplicity, so careful an avoidance of purely scientific terminologry, as to be an equal delight to the 
average reader and to the more advanced student. The author has certainly deserved well of his audience, and it ought to 
be a large, as it will certainly be an appreciative, one." — Argonaut, San Francisco.

rise from its perusal having, without effort, attained a wider knowledge of his calling. . . . " — Daily Telegraph, London.

have written the ' several volumes.' But if that hiay not be we gladly welcome Mr. Farrer's masterly study of this curious 
subject. He lfe.s sifted with skill an enormous mass of material, and has made his narrative alluringly fresh and vivid. . . .

and which science need not reject: (1) The existence of a Deity; (2) the immortality of man; and (3) a Divine scheme 
of evolution of which we form part, and which, as expressing the purpose of the Deity, proceeds under the sway of an 
inflexible order.

OUR OC TOGEN ARIANS. 

Dr. Edward Everett Hale celebrated the 
eighty-fifth anniversary of his birth the other 
day, and the occasion seems to deserve a word 
of recognition. He is regarded by many as the 
most distinguished of Americans now living ; 
and even those who might hesitate to accord 
him that unique station would hardly deny him 
a place in the esteem and affection of his fellow- 
countrymen that few others share. The example 
of his life is one of the things that make all 
Americans proud of their national birthright. 
The aristocracy to which he belongs is one whose 
sway we may admit without a murmur, for it is 
the divinely-appointed aristocracy of intellect 
and character. The poet's line — 

" Old age hath yet his honor and his toil " — 
is exemplified in both of its aspects by Dr. Hale, 
for the advancing years that have heaped new 
honors upon his head have also found his shoul- 
ders strong to bear new burdens of enterprise 
and responsibility. How the record of that rich 
and active career puts slothfulness to shame 
and illustrates the immense value that a single 
devoted life may have to the community that 
enjoys its beneficence ! 

Other octogenarians we have also, and claim 
with pride as examples of worthy manhood and 
womanhood consecrated to high ideals. Beside 
the figure of Dr. Hale there stands the figure 
of his fellow-Bostonian, Colonel Higginson, only 
a year his junior, his rival in all good works, 
still strenuous in the spirit as once in the flesh. 
The arm that lent its strength to the attempted 
rescue of Anthony Bums, and that dealt stout 
blows in the cause of human liberty, now wields 
no heavier weapon than the pen, but finds that 
as effective an implement of warfare as ever. 
The old-time abolitionist, still heeding in the 
eve of his life the voice obeyed at prime, is now 
raised as valiantly in behaK of Philippine free- 
dom as it was raised in behalf of negro freedom 
in the mid-century years. 

Coeval with these two men, Mr. Donald G. 
Mitchell is rounding out an honorable age in 
the retirement of his Connecticut country home. 
His " Dream Life " and " Reveries of a Bache- 
lor" were published so long ago that they no 
longer enjoy the protection that our copyright 
laws grudgingly bestow ; they are books belong-

ing to so remote a past that it seems difficult 
to realize that their author is yet among the 
living. But they are still widely read and cher- 
ished, and " Ik Marvel " may find in this fact 
some compensation for the loss of his control 
over their publication. Philadelphia, the city of 
his birth, is still the home of Mr. Henry Charles 
Lea, whose solid achievement in historical schol- 
arship is evidenced by many volumes, the list of 
which is not yet complete, for he is still the 
indefatigable worker that he has always been. 
And oldest of all our octogenarians, the still 
lively father of a livelier son, Mr. John Bigelow 
from his home on the Hudson looks abroad with 
keen vision upon the world of thought and 
action, and recalls his long career of useful ser- 
vice. At least two women must be added to 
this list, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe is close to the 
nineties, but her philanthropic zeal is unchilled 
with the years, and the spirit that found expres- 
sion in " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " is 
still strong to champion the right. And Mrs. 
Julia Dorr, transplanted in childhood from the 
South to the North, still lends the grace of her 
life to her home in the hiUs of Vermont. 

One other name we must put upon our list, 
for, although English by birth and Canadian by 
residence, Mr. Goldwin Smith has come into 
such intimate relations with our national life 
during the past forty years that we may fairly 
claim a large interest in his distinguished career. 
The sage of the Toronto " Grange " is now in 
his eighty-fourth year. He is old enough to 
have been a fellow-fighter with Bright and 
Cobden in the battle for free-trade, and to have 
been one of the first of the Saturday Reviewers. 
He even has boyish memories of the jubilation 
over the passage of the Reform BiU. His 
thought has concerned itself with nearly every 
subject that seriously concerns mankind, and 
the broad sanity of his ideas has upon many 
critical occasions helped our judgment to keep 
its balance true. He is one of the wisest of 
men, and one of the few Englishmen who have 
understood the deep idealism that lies at the 
foundation of our national existence. 

We have named eight octogenarians out of 
the four hundred or thereabouts whose bio- 
graphies might be discovered by a diligent ex- 
amination of " Who's Who in America." These 
eight have been chosen because their reputation 
rests primarily upon intellectual distinction as 
illustrated by their published works. It seems 
to us a remarkable showing, on the whole, and 
it is doubtfid if it could be paralleled in En- 
gland or elsewhere. Furthermore, when we | 



consider the number of our great writers of the 
past who lived to be octogenarians — Bancroft, 
Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes — the 
American exhibit of longevity in the ranks of 
authorship becomes even more striking, and 
more difficult of matching in the annals of other 
countries. We are proud of these men, and 
are profuse in the bestowal of lip-service upon 
them ; but we ask whether our pride in their 
possession would find adequate expression in 
case of need. Those whom we have named are 
in comfortable circumstances, as far as we know, 
so placed by their own efforts ; but we cannot 
help wondering whether, if any of them were 
in actual want, we should find practical ways of 
making them feel our gratitude as a people for 
their useful and distinguished lives. Genius 
starving in the garret, and honorable achieve- 
ment destitute in old age, have been exemplified 
by many grievous past instances ; is such neg- 
lect any less liable to be laid at our doors than 
at those of other people in other times? This 
is a searching question, and we do not feel alto- 
gether comfortable about the answer it would 
get if our people were put to the test. It seems 
to be one of our national failings that we are 
inclined to push the old impatiently aside in 
most of the walks of life, and to bestow upon 
eager and impetuous youth many honors that 
should be reserved for men of maturer years. 
We do this in the name of efficiency ; but it is 
a practice that tends to dull the fine edge of 
justice and make dim the lustre of its shield. 



THE VICTORIAN LITERATURE. 



A rush of Maenads across the scene ; Furies 
darting here and there with fiery torches and hissing 
tresses ; Bacchanals dancing tipsily in, escorting a 
hero's catafalque ; in front, orgies over a grave ; in 
the background the blaze of battle sunsets and the 
wreaths of snow-clad heights : — by some such pic- 
ture as this one might image forth the Georgian 
times in England. Then England was at the storm 
centre of the world. In the French Revolution, the 
American Revolution, the Napoleonic wars, it was 
either protagonist or antagonist. And its literature 
was coincident and coequal with its deeds, which is 
more than could be said of France at that time. Burns 
preached the revolt of the natural man and the poli- 
tical man. Burke grappled single-handed with the 
French Revolution. Byron laimched himself on a 
lonely crusade against the powers of reaction. Scott 
created a nation and revealed the past of Em'ope. 
Wordsworth, like a Druid seer, stood upon his rocky 
heights and laid his commands on Nature itself. 
Coleridge unlocked the door where the Supernatural 
was sealed away. Shelley sang the strains of an

impossible perfection, and Keats bodied forth the 
last charm of sensuous life. All was daring, ori- 
ginal, vivid, and alive. This age in England seems 
to me on the whole the greatest literary epoch of 
the last two hundred and fifty years. No other 
recent period has lifted so blazing a torch or shook 
its sparks so far abroad to kindle conflagrations 
in distant lands. Goethe and his compeers did work 
quite as solid and enduring, but, as they realized 
themselves, something of natural power, of daemonic 
inspiration, was wanting to them. Man for man, 
the Frenchmen of 1830 were inferior to their En- 
glish predecessors. 

Turn now to the succeeding age in England. If 
we shut our eyes and try to conjure up a generalized 
picture of it, the scene would be something like this : 
A gentle valley bedded deep with the green of trees 
and grass. On one side, a village with houses of 
old-time charm from which look forth or emerge 
girls of graceful loveliness and tranquil mien. In 
the middle, a field where lithe young athletes con- 
tend in various games. Toward the rear, an inn 
the very air about which is redolent of good cheer. 
And in the background manor-houses and mansions, 
each one looking down upon the world from its own 
seclusion. All is peace and rest and content. 

It would be an error, of course, to say that during 
Victoria's long reign 

" No drum with beaten sound 
Was heard the whole world round," 

but in comparison with most ages in the history of 
the world, it was a time of calm, of prosperity, of ma- 
terial development. And its literature was like unto 
it. It was a literature of the idyllic and the lyric 
in poetry, of humor and light comedy in the novel. 

The predominant note of the Victorian literature 
is, I think, its virginal purity. Never before, except 
in the Greek poets and in Shakespeare, was the 
young girl drawn with such tender respect and ad- 
miration. And, without exception, she was never 
before so permitted to stamp herself upon a litera- 
ture, and stamp out all that might offend her in- 
stincts or interest. By the side of Homer's chival- 
rous portraits of women and girls there is Hesiod 
with his rather low judgment of the lovelier sex. 
By the side of Sophocles and Euripides, with their 
lofty heroines, is Aristophanes with his utter irre- 
verence and world-upsetting indecency. And in 
Chaucer and Shakespeare, women of the coarsest 
and basest type jostle their fair and fragrant sisters. 

But the Victorian poets and novelists are the 
slaves of the young girl and the virtuous matron. 
They draw their chariots. Tennyson's poetry is a 
gallery of fair women; they dominate his books 
almost to the exclusion of any male interest. Coven- 
try Patmore instituted a new religion of the Vu-gin. 
In Browning, man is merely the attendant planet 
which revolves around a female sun. It is the same 
with the novelists. They treat their heroines with 
adoring worship, as something more than human. 
When Thackeray wished to draw the picture of 
a thoroughly bad woman, he hardly dared to hint 



that in some matters she was not quite all she ought 
to be. 

This chivalry, characteristic of the Celtic tempera- 
ment, is not characteristic of the Saxon mind. There 
is a vast region of English literature, extending 
from Dryden and Wycherley down through Field- 
ing and Smollett and Sterne, where it is not in evi- 
dence at all. Perhaps the comparative peacefulness 
of the Victorian age is the reason why the feminine 
influence became so powerful. Not only laws, but 
women, are silent amid the clash of arms. 

A second feature of the Victorian literature is its 
domesticity — its concern for the narrow things of 
the household. It is the literature of the home ; and 
the home may be either a shrine or a prison. It 
makes for goodness, but it does not make for free- 
dom. There is a spirit of adventure, a carelessness 
of consequence, in all older literatures, which is 
largely wanting in the books of this age. Generally 
in the plays and poems and novels of the past, the 
mere fact of getting a living, the mere furniture 
and surroundings of life, are taken for granted, 
relegated to the background, or treated as a joke. 
But money, property, position, — these are the 
serious things to the Victorian writers. The reward 
of virtue with them is a coach-and-four, a country 
house with pleasant grounds, the being on calling 
terms with the best families. It was not for nothing 
that the " Book of Snobs " was written in this age. 
Nearly everyone, from Tennyson down, was tainted 
with the worship of caste. Perhaps it came out most 
strongly in Bulwer, aman of genius to whom bad taste 
clung like a Nessus shirt. Carlyle blew the trumpet 
of revolt against this worship, and one can measure 
the work he had to do by the effort he had to make. 
The understanding of the power of money and 
the comforts of home is the beginning of realism. 
Idealism is possible to a poet who, like Horace, 
could go singing through a wood filled with robbers ; 
it is possible to a hermit like Wordsworth or Thoreau. 
But a writer who likes to have everything comfort- 
able about him must unconsciously picture man as 
he is, not man as he ought to be. He must fail of 
sympathy with the great ideas, the great ambitions, 
the heroic actions of life. 

Notwithstanding its snobbery, the Victorian age 
saw, if not the beginning, an immense development 
of sympathy for the poor and lowly. The short and 
simple annals of the poor were found capable of 
infinite illustration. Low-life has always been the 
haunt of humor ; but Dickens discovered that the 
poor have not only more fun among them, but more 
freedom and happiness than their superiors. Joy 
is the thing that makes literature permanent — not 
the vulgar joy which can only see happiness in pink- 
and-white colors, in a succession of sugar-plums, in 
the negation of pain, but the joy which springs from 
keen and lofty effort, whether foredoomed to failure 
or success. Dick Swiveller barricading himself round 
by a circle of unpaid scores for " the rosy," Micawber 
strenuously waiting for something to turn up, doubt- 
less felt, when either of them did raise the wind by 



244

some lucky expedient, the same exalted joy that 
filled the stadium runner of Greece when he touched 
the post; and they communicate this joy to us. It 
is by reason of his discovery of the immense re- 
sources of happiness among the poor that Dickens's 
work is the great literary creation of the age. 
Squalid and gloomy and horrible, you say his pic- 
tures are. Yes ; but out of this squalor and gloom 
and horror spring the most beautiful flowers of 
life — self-sacrifice, heroism, patient kindness, and 
sparkling wit. The relations of tragedy to joy in 
literature are universally mistaken. We sympathize 
with the effort rather than with the end. Who 
would not accept AchiUes' early death, if he could 
deck himself in the splendor of that hero? Who 
would not go through Hamlet's troubles, if he could 
do it with the kingly mien, the intellectual domi- 
nance of the Dane ? We do not love death or pain 
or poverty, but we love the great spirits which can 
react against these dark, hard things, and strike out 
light for the centuries. 

Mild religious doubt was a great preoccupation 
of the Victorian writers. The day of defiance was 
past. Byron and Shelley had been Titans hurling 
mountains at Zeus ; but Tennyson, Arnold, Brown- 
ing, Newman, were simply disillusioned clergymen, 
timidly picking flaws in the plan of the universe, or 
falling back upon faith and authority. England 
had to go to a not very distinguished Persian poet 
of the past to get its most thorough-going statement 
of the eternal problems. 

The Scientific spirit, and the rise of the Evolu- 
tionary theory, which last had its home in England, 
have been accused of or praised for great influence 
on modern literature and life. But it seems to me 
that their power has been vastly overrated. The 
general conceptions of the creed of Evolution, which 
are all the world takes note of, are at least as old as 
Greek philosophy, and there have been no great 
doings from them in the past. At the most, they 
can but alter the special forms of religious belief. 
They cannot shake the basis of faith. Men will go 
on believing in God, and the immortality of the 
soul, and redemption for sin, in the future as they 
always have in the past. If the old theologies 
fail to satisfy, they will frame new ones. 

There remains to be said something about the 
technical qualities of the Victorian literatm-e. In 
style — which, in its limited sense, I take to mean 
concentration, vividness and freshness of speech — 
the age must stand or fall with its leader, Tenny- 
son. Now it seems to me that in most of the great 
excellences of style, he is inferior not only to 
Shakespeare and Milton but to Gray and Collins, 
Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Keats. His best work 
brought into juxtaposition with theirs already shows 
a little faded. It has not the final simplicity, the 
jewel-like sparkle, the lasting memorable weight, of 
theirs. In prose, it may be said at once that the 
age had no original technical gift. All the weapons 
of English prose were forged long before and used 
with more effect. In simple prose it did not beat 



Swift or Defoe ; in eloquent prose it did not reach 
the heights of Jeremy Taylor, Milton, or Burke ; and 
in perfect prose it has nothing which can compare 
with that of Shakespeare, Congi-eve, or Goldsmith. 

One technical quality, however, the age did revive, 
resuscitate, and carry to great triumphs. This is the 
almost invaluable quality of tone, by which a piece 
of literature is projected forth all of one piece, with 
its own special atmosphere and light. The supreme 
examples of this excellence in art are the best plays 
of Shakespeare. " Macbeth " and " King Lear," 
"Cymbeline," "Twelfth Night," "A Merchant 
of Venice," "As You Like It," "The Midsummer 
Night's Dream," were thrown out by Shakespeare's 
creating mind, each flawless in its unity of color, like 
the red and blue and green and mauve and yellow 
stars which dance in the tangles of the Pleiades. 
After Shakespeare this virtue in literature fell into 
abeyance — for Milton's elevation and majesty are 
quite different things. The wits and novel-writers 
who succeeded thought that all that went to the 
making of a book was a vast amount of human inci- 
dent and a great bundle of brilliant sayings. In 
Gray's " Elegy " the thing was born again ; and in 
the best pieces of Collins — the " Ode to Evening " 
and the " Highland Ode " — it attained a high perfec- 
tion. Four or five poems by Coleridge and as many 
by Keats show the virtue to the full. And by a 
special miracle, Scott in one story, " The Bride of 
Lammermoor," attains a truth of tone which makes 
that novel rank above all his others. Now the gift 
of tone was habitual with Tennyson. Not only in 
his shorter and eai'lier pieces — like " The Dying 
Swan," "The Two Sisters," " Mariana" — but in his 
more ambitious works — " Maud," " The Princess," 
" The Idylls " — is this excellence innate and of im- 
perative appeal. Tone was, if not Rossetti's sole 
stock in trade, at least his most valuable asset. It 
is implicit, though not overwhelmingly apparent, in 
Arnold. James Thomson's " City of Dreadful 
Night " is a remarkable example of it. The novel 
writers, too, possess the gift. Three such varying 
tales as " Barnaby Rudge," " Wuthering Heights," 
and " Armadale " are fulfilled with it almost in 
extreme measure. And in a different kind, " Pick- 
wick," " Cranford," and " Silas Marner " are perfect 
in atmosphere. The cultivation of tone is, I should 
say, the most valuable technical achievement of 
modern English literature. 

On the whole, however, the Victorian literature 
is deficient in greatness, originality, daring, soul. 
For strife it substituted comfort, for splendor it 
substituted charm, for fierce satire or soul-shattering 
tragedy it substituted gentle irony and light humor. 
There are to-day, and there always will be, innu- 
merable readers to whom these secondary qualities 
appeal most. But every age can supply them for 
itself. I am inclined to think that future genera- 
tions wiU prefer to light their torches at the battle- 
beacons of the Georgian epoch rather than at the 
modest hearth-fires of the Victorian age.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The aberrations of contemporary judgments 
are a continual source of amusement and amazement 
to posterity. In one of Christopher North's longest 
essays (it is almost a treatise), he passes in review all 
the chief writers of his time — Scott, Wordsworth, 
Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and the others — and decides 
that no one of them was a great poet, but that the two 
who came nearest to making good their claim to that 
title were Robert Southey and Joanna Baillie ! Mat- 
thew Arnold has a passage in one of his letters which 
throws a curious light on this subject. He attended a 
great literary banquet in London, and foimd himself 
seated at one of the lower tables until George Augustus 
Sala and Edmund Yates saw him and escorted him to 
the higher board where they had places by right. In 
the recently published life of Charles Lever there is an 
instance of the unexpected modesty of genius in assess- 
ing its own value. A chapter is devoted to the cor- 
respondence of Lever with Miss Edgeworth, wherein 
the creator of Mickey Free and Corny Delaney and 
Major Monsoon is shown as almost grovelling in abase- 
ment at the feet of the admirable though rather mediocre 
author of " Castle Rackrent." The worship which both 
Scott and Lever paid to Miss Edgeworth is a strik- 
ing testimony to the power of even execution and aca- 
demic correctness. Lever not only repented at her 
shrine the great sins of his youth, Harry Lorrequer, 
Jack Hinton, and Charles O'Malley, but he turned to 
imitation of her in a long series of dull books. It is his 
sins of fiction that the world will remember. Surely, 
" Charles O'Malley " is the best war-novel ever writ- 
ten, Tolstoi's " War and Peace " and the tales of Mr. 
Kipling to the contrary notwithstanding. In reading 
Tolstoi's vast works, one wonders why men should ever 
go out to fight, for he makes warfare the dullest, dreariest 
business human beings can engage in. In Lever, on 
the other hand, there is all the fun and frolic and ad- 
venture which lures men to action, — and there is, too, 
much of the high magnanimities and deep loyalties of 
the heroic life. Lever's rollicking revelry has been 
objected to as being out. of keeping with the serious 
business of war. But everyone who has been for a long 
time under circumstances of great stress and danger 
will at once recognize as true the overwrought exulta- 
tion which faces death with a flow of nonsense, or gay 
defiance, or even blasphemy. This feeling has been 
crystallized into that memorable short poem, " Revelry 
in India"; and Lever gives it most successfully. 
• • • 

Our much-decried "American-English" has a 
good word (of a certain sort) spoken for it by an emi- 
nent English scholar and writer. Mr. Sidney Lee, in 
addressing a British society lately established « to help 
to maintain the correct use of English, and to promote 
the due recognition of English as an essential element 
in national education," adduced the significant fact that 
Harvard University has twenty teachers of English, 
while Oxford has but one ; and this disparity he regarded 
as fairly representing the different degrees of import- 
ance attached to English language and literature studies 
in the two countries. We mean well, it would seem, 
even if we are young and ignorant. Some such sooth- 
ing balm as this was needed after the " dressing down " 
we speakers of the United States dialect (especially the 
female portion of us) have received, whether deservedly 



or not, at the hands of another Englishman (by adop- 
tion), who, after long exile (self-imposed), returns to 
his mother country and indulges in comments, not 
always complimentary, on her habits and peculiarities. 
• • • 
A LIBRARIAN WHO IS ALSO A HUMAN BEING is what 
Mr. Charles F. Lummis, public librarian (among other 
things) at Los Angeles, has been not inappropriately 
called. Bibliothecal duties imquestionably tend to mum- 
mify the body and pedantify the mind; but here we have 
a guardian of printed wisdom who is alert and brimming 
over with new ideas, and most undeniably alive. Under 
his more than up-to-date administration the Los Angeles 
library, as the librarian's second ammal report announces, 
has moved into a new building, and has opened a roof- 
garden to its patrons as an alfresco reading-room. (Happy 
the reading public in that balmy clime!) Smokers are 
welcome. Onlyindecent books are blacklisted. Mr. Lum- 
mis holds that what the tax-payer asks for, within reason- 
able limits, he should have ; and if he feels a craving that 
nothing but " The Cameron Pride " or " Dick Onslow

The AVOCATIONS of great men are even more in- 
teresting, because more intimately characteristic, than 
their vocations. Hence we note, with something more 
than a passing glance at the announcement, that Mr. 
H. G. Wells, writer of ingenious and startling stories, 
has been appointed a justice of the peace for Folkstone; 
also that Mr. Thomas Hardy, veteran novelist of assured 
renown, is and is proud to be a justice of the peace for 
Dorset, In fact, Mr. Hardy takes more satisfaction in 
this minor office than in being known on two continents 
as the author of " Tess." All of which might easily 
remind one of Czar Peter's passion for shipbuilding, 
and of the boyish glee with which he carried home to 
his Czarina his first wages earned by manual labor; of 
King Louis's bent for clockmaking; of a certain living 
emperor's pride in his own poetry and painting; and so 
on, to any length. One likes best the work in which 
voluntary choice has freest play. Also, all men are 
gratified to find how well they can (or think they can) 
do some things with the left hand.

The literature of the steerage — that is, the kind 
of reading matter in request among " third cabin " pas- 
sengers — has been made the subject of inquiry; and it 
appears that whereas first-class and second-class voy- 
agers on our monster liners demand almost exclusively 
the very latest novels, with which the ship's library is 
forced to stock itself just before the boat's departure, 
the humble occupants of quarters near the throbbing 
vitals of the vessel must be content with standard au- 
thors, — Shakespeare, Tolstoi (the earlier Tolstoi, pre- 
sumably), Hugo, and Dickens. Blessed are the poor in 
pocket, for theirs is the kingdom of the literature that 

lasts.

The craze for Shakespeareana, which has already 
been mentioned in these columns, has reached such a 
pitch that even a very poor and much-patched copy of 
the so-called " John Wright " issue of the first edition 
(1609) of the Sonnets is expected to bring as much as 
a thousand pounds at the coming sale (April 18-20, at 
Sotheby's) of a " selected portion " of the library of Sir 
Henry St. John Mildmay, of Dogmersfield, Hampshire.

Some Hoped-for Victories of Peace.* 



Between those on the one hand who, like 
Herbert Spencer, believe government to be at 
best a necessary evil and its legitimate fimctions 
very narrowly restricted, and those on the other 
who, with Miss Jane Addams, of Hull House, 
Chicago, maintain that its duties are of the wid- 
est range, and its possibilities of usefulness not 
yet suspected by the world at large, there lies 
a gulf that is deep and wide. Without attempt 
ing here any balancing of arguments on each 
side, the reviewer is glad to conmiend most 
heartUy the high moral purpose and the firm 
grasp of detail that make Miss Addams's 
" Newer Ideals of Peace " a very valuable addi- 
tion to Professor Ely's " Citizen's Library," 
which has now reached its twenty-fifth volume. 

Pleas for universal peace have been addressed, 
as Miss Addams points out in her Introduction, 
first to the higher imaginative pity ; and most 
conspicuous among peace-advocates who thus 
work on our sympathies are Count Tolstoi in 
his earlier writings and Verestchagin in his 
paintings. The second line of appeal is that 
made to economic prudence ; and here again a 
Russian protagonist steps to the front in the 
person of Jean de Bloch, banker and economist, 
who convincingly presents the mcreasingly ruin- 
ous cost of militarism, and shows that its bur- 
dens threaten to bring about social revolution 
in every European country. Contrasted with 
these older appeals are those of the third or 
more aggressive school of peace-promoters, who, 
without decrying arguments of the first two 
kinds, hold that there are now developing cer- 
tain "newer social forces which it is believed 
will at last prove a ' sovereign intervention ' by 
extinguishing the possibility of battle at its very 
source." A few sentences from Miss Addams's 
opening pages wiU help to make clear this posi- 
tion, which is the one she herself holds. 

" It is difficult to formulate the newer dynamic peace, 
embodying the later humanism, as over against the old 
dogmatic peace. The word ' non-resistance ' is mis- 
leading, because it is much too feeble and inadequate. 
It suggests passivity, the goody-goody attitude of in- 
effectiveness. The words 'overcoming,' 'substituting,' 
' re-creating,' ' readjusting moral values,' ' forming new 
centres of spiritual energy ' carry much more of the 
meaning implied. For it is not merely the desire for a 
conscience at rest, for a sense of justice no longer out- 
raged, that would pull us into new paths where there 
would be no more war nor preparations for war. There 

•Newer Ideals op Peace. By Jane Addams. New York:

are still more strenuous forces at work reaching down 
to impulses and experiences as primitive and profovmd 
as are those of struggle itself. . . . The Advocates 
of Peace would find the appeal both to Pity and Pru- 
dence totally unnecessary, could they utilize the cosmo- 
politan interest in human affairs with the resultant 
social sympathy that at the present moment is develop- 
ing among all the nations of the earth." 

It is in the large cities, with their mixed 
populations, that this " cosmopolitan interest " 
and broader sympathy are to be cidtivated. To 
this end, experiments in ministering to social 
needs are to be made and governmental reforms 
instituted. Cities are with good reason " cen- 
tres of radicalism," as they have in the past 
been " cradles of liberty." It may be, thinks 
the author, that we shall be saved from mili- 
tarism by the " fighting rabble " itseK, by the 
quarrelsome mob turned into kindly citizens of 
the world through the pressure of a cosmopoli- 
tan neighborhood. 

" It is not that they are shouting for peace — on the 
contrary, if they shout at all they will continue to shout 
for war — r but that they are really attaining cosmo- 
politan relations through daily experience. They will 
probably believe for a long time that war is noble and 
necessary both to engender and cherish patriotism ; and 
yet all of the time, below their shouting, they are living 
in the kingdom of human kindness." 

The newer and more aggressive humanitarian- 
ism makes for social amelioration in the pro- 
tective legislation that takes account of the 
weakest citizen as a valuable asset. It protests 
against the social waste involved in child labor, 
and it also demands that woman's recognized 
aptitudes shall be utilized in civic life. 

Even in our city governments Miss Addams 
finds too much of the spirit of militarism, — 
an administration concerning itself grudgingly 
with the people's social needs and limiting ite 
activities chiefly to the enacting and enforcing 
of restrictive measures. The police department, 
a most conspicuous survival of militarism, re- 
ceives disproportionate attention. That govern- 
ment support is generously given to education, 
the author freely admits ; but she criticizes the 
reluctance of the municipality to take in hand 
a multitude of other public interests of like 
importance. A chapter is devoted to our failure, 
through a certain cast-iron inflexibility of law 
and custom, to make intelligent use of immi- 
grants in civic affairs — a difficult problem, 
surely ; another to our defective industrial leg- 
islation ; and stiU another to the " group mor- 
ality" exemplified by trades-unions and other 
organizations and classes, whose several activi- 
ties are not yet harmonized and xmited for the 
common good.

Excellent chapters on " Protection of Chil- 
dren for Indiistrial Efficiency," " Women in 
Government," and " Passing of the War Vir- 
tues," close the book. The sad waste of human 
energy and even human life due to child-labor 
is forcibly and pathetically illustrated by a case 
from Miss Addams's experience. The mother of 
five children had died ; the father, a drunkard, 
had disappeared ; a feeble old grandmother re- 
mained. The oldest boy, not yet twelve, was 
a fine, manly little fellow, who recognized it as 
his duty to care for the family. 

" We found him a place as cash-boy in a department 
store for two dollars a week. He held it for three years, 
although his enthusiasm failed somewhat as the months 
went by and he gradually discovered how little help his 
wages were to the family exchequer after his car-fare, 
decent clothes and unending pairs of shoes were paid 
for. Before the end of the third year he had become 
listless and indifferent to his work, in spite of the m- 
crease of fifty cents a week. In the hope that a change 
would be good for him, a place as elevator-boy was 
secured. This he was unable to keep ; and then one 
situation after another slipped through his grasp, until 
a typhoid fever, which he developed at the age of fifteen, 
seemed to explain his apathy. After a long illness and 
a poor recovery, he worked less well. Finally, at the 
age of sixteen, when he should have been able really to 
help the little family and perhaps be its main support, 
he had become a professional tramp, and eventually 
dropped completely from our knowledge." 

It is needless to say that the author is at her 
best on the subject of Woman Suffrage ; but 
without quoting her in that connection, let us 
choose our final quotation from her closing chap- 
ter. Professor WUliam James, who is cited in 
the Introduction, has well urged the need to 
" discover something heroic that will speak to 
men as universally as war has done, and yet 
wiU be as compatible with their spiritual natures 
as war has proved to be incompatible," Miss 
Addams says : 

" In a political campaign men will go through every 
possible hardship iii response to certain political loyal- 
ties; in a moment of national danger men will sacrifice 
every personal advantage. It is but necessary to make 
this fellowship wider, to extend its scope without lower- 
ing its intensity. Those emotions which stir the spirit 
to deeds of self-surrender and to high enthusiasm, are 
among the world's most precious assets. That this 
emotion has so often become associated with war, by no 
means proves that it cannot be used for other ends. 
There is something active and tangible in this new in- 
ternationalism, although it is difficult to make it clear, 
and in our striving for a new word with which to ex- 
press this new and important sentiment we are driven 
to the rather absurd phrase of ' cosmic patriotism.' 
Whatever it may be called, it may yet be strong enough 
to move masses of men out of their narrow national 
considerations and cautions into new reaches of human 
effort and affection. Religion has long ago taught that 
only as the individual can establish a sense of imion 



with a power for righteousness not himself, can he ex- 
perience peace; and it may be possible that the nations 
will be called to a similar experience." 

The desired word for Miss Addams's world- 
embracing patriotism might seem to be " hu- 
manitarianism," except that this term, like a 
coin long-minted, has become rubbed and worn, 
and is lacking in sharpness and precision. A 
fresh word is desirable. 

As an immediate and effective solution of the 
main problem indicated by its title, this treatise 
may well prove less successful than as a manual 
of instruction in methods of mutual service and 
a plea for mutual sympathy and good- will ; but 
for moral earnestness such as comes only of a 
life spent in good works, for persuasiveness such 
as speaks but from actual experience of things 
seen and heard and participated in, for high- 
souled nobility of purpose such as can mark no 
book written with other than a perfectly unsel- 
fish end in view, it is sure to take a high place 
in the literature of its kind, and, whatever its 
proportions of truth and error — which time 
alone can tell — it should accomplish a deal of 
good in the great work of social amelioration 
now in progress. Percy F. Bicknell. 



Two Bishops of the Western Frontier." 



About the time of the close of the Civil War 
there was a sparsely settled and little-known 
region in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, 
which was felt to be destined to become the 
home of a large population at some future time 
and to be an important part of our American 
nation. It comprised the " wild and woolly 
West " of those days, and was the home of the 
miner, the cowboy, the adventurer, the fugitive 
from justice, and the Mormon. The United 
States government organized therein the ter- 
ritories of Utah, Montana, and Idaho, compris- 
ing respectively about 105,000, 145,000, and 
90,000 square miles, and having a total popula- 
tion, not coimting Indians, of 155,000, or not 
quite one inhabitant to every two square miles. 
Into this vast region the Episcopal Church in 
1866 determined to send a missionary Bishop, 
and selected for that purpose the Rev. Daniel 
Sylvester Tuttle, then rector of a country parish 
in the central part of New York. The church 
chose wisely and well. Mr. Tuttle, at the time

of his election, was but twenty-nine years old, 
and had to wait until after he had passed another 
birthday before he was of sufficient age to be 
made a Bishop ; but his training in his country 
parish was of a character to fit him for the 
peculiarly difficult mission upon which he was 
sent. His official title was at first " Bishop of 
Montana, having jurisdiction also in Utah and 
Idaho." He familiarized himself with every 
portion of his vast field where any settlements 
were to be found, and after working therein 
heroically for fourteen years he prevailed upon 
the church, in 1880, to set Montana apart as a 
separate Missionary District and to select a 
Bishop therefor. He thereupon became Bishop 
of Utah with jurisdiction in Idaho, and fixed 
his home in Salt Lake City. Six years later 
he responded to a call, which then came to him 
for the second time, to become the Bishop of 
the Diocese of Missouri, and entered upon the 
work of the Bishop of a Diocese, to become also, 
more recently, by virtue of his seniority of con- 
secration, the Presiding Bishop of the Epis- 
copal Church in America. That same year, 
Idaho was separated from the jurisdiction which 
had been formerly his and was joined by Wyo- 
ming, and the Missionary District of Wyoming 
and Idaho was created. Of this, the Rev. 
Ethelbert Talbot of Missouri was elected Bishop 
and in due time consecrated. He fixed his epis- 
copal residence in Laramie, built a cathedral 
there, and labored until 1897, when he too was 
called to an Eastern Diocese and ceased to be 
a missionary bishop. 

The experiences of these two men in that re- 
gion and at that particular period of the history 
of the several states which have grown up therein 
could not fail to be of intense interest to the 
general reader. And, fortunately, both have 
been prevailed upon to write their reminiscences 
and observations of the time when they were 
building up the church in a crude civilization. 
The book of the elder bishop has the deeper 
ecclesiastical interest, though it throws not a few 
valuable side-lights upon economic conditions, 
and its chapter on the Mormons shows a states- 
manlike grasp of the subject. The author re- 
cords his experiences with no word of complaint 
for the hardships he was called upon to endure, 
and his book cannot fail to be an inspiration to 
the younger members of the ministry of his 
church, to whom he gives useful advice upon 
a variety of topics. In one respect the work 
might have been improved from a literary stand- 
point. Although begun in 1889, it was not 
completed until 1904; and before going to 



press it should have been thoroughly revised and 
the various chronological view-p6ints adjusted 
and brought into harmony with the later date. 
Bishop Talbot writes in a popular literary 
style, and for the entertainment of the general 
reader. His life as a Missionary Bishop brought 
him in contact with the class of people whom 
Mr. Owen Wister so well describes. Indeed, 
it is generally conceded that Mr. Wister refers 
to Bishop Talbot in one of his stories. The 
ground had been broken for him and the way 
smoothed for his missionary labors by his pre- 
decessors in the same field, so that he was not sub- 
jected to the same hardships as the elder Bishop, 
and he foimd leisure for recreation in hunting 
the big game of . that region. He also con- 
tributes a chapter upon the Mormons ; and one 
upon the Red Man is a valuable contribution to 
the literature of the subject. Both books are 
valuable in giving pictures, from slightly dif- 
ferent view-points, of life and conditions which 
are now rapidly disappearing from our land.

Mr. liANG's Homeric Queries.* 

Mr. Andrew Lang, when not on the trail of 
the Casket Letters, or editing vari-colored fairy 
books, or annihilating the Aryan school of myth- 
ologists, champions the unity of Homer. In his 
" Homer and the Epic " he confounded WUam- 
owitz, Kirchhoff, and the whole school of dis- 
integrating critics who rely mainly on literary 
analysis and the alleged self-contradictions of the 
poet. But much water has flowed under the 
bridges in twelve years. Mycenology has be- 
come a full-fledged specialty. HaU, Ridgeway, 
and others, have published learned works on 
the earliest civilization of Greece. Reichel and 
Robert have promulgated their complicated hy- 
potheses about Homeric weapons ; two or three 
new views of the Homeric house have been pro- 
posed ; Professor Paul Cauer has changed his 
mind with regard to the incompatibility of the 
ninth, eleventh, and sixteenth books of the Iliad ; 
and Mr. Walter Leaf has issued an enlarged 
edition of his commentary, in which he abandons 
his former faith in a school of Homeridae and 
returns to the discredited tradition of a Homer 
manufactured by the commission of Pisistratus. 
Here are "throats to be cut and work to be 
done," and Mr. Lang returns to the charge in 
his new work on " Homer and his Age."

He is very much in earnest in his resolve that 
the layman shall not be " bluffed '' by the ex 
cathedra pronouncement " Sclentia locuta est." 
The higher Homeric criticism is not a science at 
all, he protests, but a mere jungle of false logic, 
a^ morass inhabited by will o' the wisps of wanton 
hypothesis and conjecture. Mr. Lang is be- 
trayed into some slips and exaggerations by the 
vivacity of his polemic, and his own positive con- 
clusions are in their turn open to cavil. But his 
main negative contention is sound. The new 
books of Homeric criticism make a formidable 
showing of archasological, linguistic, and ethno- 
logical erudition. But as arguments they are 
mere sophistical exercitations. We have not 
gained one inch on the position defined by 
Matthew Arnold : " These are questions which 
have been debated with learning, with ingenuity, 
nay, with genius, — but there really exist no 
data for determining them." 

Mr. Lang's polemic, despite" much repetition 
and some wearisome details, holds the attention 
by a wealth of pertinent illustration from Norse 
and Old French literature, and by the force 
and cunning of his dialectical sword-play. The 
disintegrationists collect examples of apparent 
diversities or inconsistencies in different parts 
of Homer in regard to language, ideas religious 
or ethical, burial and marriage customs, land 
tenure, weapons and warfare, the structure of 
the house, the knowledge and use of metals. 
These are mechanically combined in theories of 
the secular evolution of the various " strata " 
of the Iliad and Odyssey. Mr. Lang is not con- 
tent with showing up in detail the trivial and 
Inconclusive character of many of the alleged 
tests of earlier and later work. He is not sat- 
isfied with the effective but easy retort that the 
critics contradict one another far more than do 
the various Homers whom they postulate. He 
forces us to realize at every step the full con- 
crete historical implications of the theory that 
the Iliad and Odyssey are a late patchwork of 
poems, composed, interpolated, and altered 
through three or four centuries of changing 
civilization and language. 

The Iliad possesses artistic and historical 
unity enough for the unanalytical reader. If 
it is a slow organic growth, or a compilation of 
the work of a school, why has no other epic ever 
been produced in the same way ? The Kalevala 
is not an epic, though Lonnrot, dealing freely 
with his materials, tried to make it one. Neither 
is the Edda. The chansons de geste were not 
pieced together out of lays, but freely composed. 
Even the relative success of the Niehelungen 



Lied required an individual author. If the 
apparent unity of archaic color in the Iliad was 
maintained by the conscious conventions of a 
poetical guild, why have no other poems before 
the nineteenth century archaized in this fashion 
— not Beowulf with its allusions to Christianity, 
not the authors of the mediaeval French epics 
who attribute to tenth century knights the 
armorial bearings of a later age, not even the 
learned Virgil, or ApoUonius of Rhodes, or 
Quintus of Smyrna. If the irresponsible Ionian 
rhapsodists who composed the songs that grew 
into the Iliad consciously avoided reference to 
writing, coined money, seal rings, and in general 
to ideas, institutions, and geographical names 
later than the original kernel of the poem, why 
did the more literary cyclic poets, their contem- 
poraries by the hypothesis, introduce so many 
un-Homeric touches ? If we reject as interpo- 
lations ail passages that do not fit our theories, 
and assmne that some of the interpolators care- 
f vdly archaized while others followed the customs 
of their own day, may we not deduce any con- 
clusions from any text ? By what study of con- 
stitutional history were late Ionian strolling 
bards enabled to preserve throughout the Iliad 
the consistent picture of feudal institutions ex- 
hibited* in the relations of the Overlord Aga- 
memnon to his liegemen ? Why should they 
freely interpolate the corslet, but rarely the 
Ionian round shield, its natural accompaniment ? 
Or why should not the Homeric man, like the 
Algonquin Indian, have used both the corslet 
and the big oblong shield which in the opinion of 
the German professor rendered it superfluous ? 
Why should Homer, though familiar with iron, 
rarely if ever speak of iron weapons, if not for 
the reason that iron was not yet sufficiently well 
tempered to be used in war? How much do 
we really know about early Greek land-tenure, 
and what probability is there that the great 
chieftains of the Iliad cultivated no larger 
domain than the lot which fell to a Thersites ? 
How could the author of the " late " tenth book 
of the Iliad describe a type of Mycenaean cap 
revealed to us by recent excavations ? Had he 
studied it in an archaeological museum ? Why 
should we expect all Homeric houses to conform 
to one type, and why should the daughters of 
princes not sleep in an upper chamber in the 
Iliad as well as in the Odyssey ? 

Such are some of the questions propounded 
by Mr. Lang. And as he can obtain no satis- 
factory answer, he concludes that the Homeric 
poems are a consistent picture of a single age of 
Greek civilization, the sub-Mycenaean, which 



250

falls somewhere between the shaft graves of 
Mycenae (1500-1100) and the time represented 
by the Dipylon tombs at Athens (900-750). 

The probability of Mr. Lang's conclusion is 
not seriously affected by the inadvertencies and 
omissions which closer scrutiny would bring 
out. He deals timidly with the linguistic argu- 
ment, admitting regretfully or ironically that he 
is no grammarian. But though it is a curious 
and interesting fact that "later" forms are of 
more frequent occurrence in certain books of 
the Iliad, cautious reasoners are coming more 
and more to admit that the evidence is too 
slight to support any definite conclusion. We 
are forced back on the formula of the ancients, 
" Homer " employed a mixed composite dialect. 
Again, that Mr. Lang seems to have studied only 
Reichel on Homeric weapons, and but for a 
few casual references, almost ignores the ela- 
borate hypotheses of Robert, might be groimd 
of cavil for a partisan of the latter. But no 
student of Homer is under any real obligation 
to disentangle the cobweb of ingenious sophistry 
that Robert has spun about the subject. And 
similarly of the much- vexed racial problem. We 
do not know whether the Achaeans of Homer 
were Mycenaeans, Pelasgians (whatever that 
may mean), or Celtic invaders from the north ; 
nor does the question affect the unity of the 
Iliad. The real strength of the disintegrationist 
position is the cumulative impression (I do not 
say the cumulative logical force) of arguments 
singly mitenable. Where there is so much 
smoke, we think there must be some fife. 
" Tantus labor non sit cassus,^^ we exclaim. 
But every age has its own forms of scholasticism. 
The argument from the apparent consensus of 
the learned is naught. It is temporary and 
will change with the next new fashion. Homeric 
scholars read one another's books, and a few 
leaders set the fashion for any decade. " Fore 
God, they are all in one tale," the puzzled lay- 
man cries. Paul Shorey. 



The liESsoN OF the Dutch Republic* 



The evolution of the Dutch nation, and the 
rise of a mighty republic on a piece of land that 
was little more than a stretch of swamp and 
sand scarcely five thousand miles in area, makes 
one of the most wonderful stories since the time 
of the Romans. When this Northern David 
took up sling and stone against panoplied Spain, 
the Dutch people numbered less than a million

souls. The modem state contains three times 
the area and over five times the population of 
its prototype in 1567. Besides administering 
ably a vast colonial empire, it is one of the 
most thriving and prosperous of the smaller 
states of Europe. For two centuries it was the 
leader of civilization and the foremost exponent 
of progressive ideas in Europe. Then it suf- 
fered a long decline before its rejuvenation in 
the nineteenth century. 

Mr. Barker, the author of " The Decline and 
Fall of the Netherlands," does not seem to know 
much about the modem renaissance of that 
country. In the articles he has written for 
European reviews during the past year or two, 
he presages the absorption of the land of dykes 
into mighty Germany, although his arguments 
seem more ingenious than convincing. In his 
book, he concludes his historical survey with 
the fall of the republic and of the Frenchified 
Kingdom of HoUand. Although his work is sur- 
charged with ideas and notions that are meant 
to illustrate " the economic interpretation of 
history," he ignores the fact that while even as 
late as the nineteenth century England had coal 
and iron in plenty to meet the necessities of 
civilization, Holland, being utterly without these 
resources, has not been able to compete with 
her island neighbor ; and in earlier times, also, 
Great Britain had vastly greater internal sup- 
plies. Mr. Barker shows lack of acquaintance 
also with authorities that might have helped him 
to sounder conclusions, — as, for example, the 
more recent critical historical writings of the 
Leyden and Utrecht schools. 

The philosophy of decline and decay may be 
as valuable as that of adolescence and growth. 
In any event it is certain that the author has 
contributed a work of singular value to all those 
who would have the study of history made as 
fruitfid and practical as possible. He has, we 
think, hurt rather than helped his lively book 
by overloading it with quotations from the 
classic authors, such as Aristotle, Thucydides, 
Machiavelli, and others who have already served 
long enough for copy-book inscriptions. It is 
refreshing, however, to find him quoting also 
John Pym and George Washington, besides 
Motley and Grattan. 

Mr. Barker re-reads Dutch history in the 
light of the native authors of the old school and 
of general modem (foreign) writers ; and he 
does so critically. He gives slight place to the 
business either of blood-letting or of diplomacy, 
except as these themes illuminate his thesis ; for 
he is evidently a tendency-writer, and quite

equal to Grote, who preached British policy in 
a history of Greece. Being a stalwart British 
Imperialist, he shows how the politicians have 
always mismanaged military enterprises. He 
would evidently have every general and admiral 
cut the wires of communication as soon as the 
march or the expedition is begun. His main 
idea is that Great Britain, in order to keep 
pace with Germany and the United States, must 
form an imperial confederacy and have a written 
constitution ; otherwise, the British nation will 
surely recede into obscurity and give up the 
world to Yankee and Teuton. To the American, 
the book is especially worthy of reading and 
study, for the wonderfully illuminating power 
with which it explores Dutch history to show 
the danger of the divisive forces in a nation. In 
the world-old struggle between local and central 
government, one can read in Dutch history the 
warnings that befit alike Americans in a federal 
union and Englishmen under a constitutional 
monarchy. 

The plague of Dutch history 'and the greatest 
hindrance to development lay in local and divi- 
sive forces. These prevented the realization of 
a true national union. Until modem times 
there was no centralized government of suffi- 
cient strength to solve the problems besetting 
the commonwealth. In the Middle Ages free- 
dom had been won from feudal lords, not by the 
people in their collective capacity, but by the 
cities, which finely wrought out the idea of 
mimicipal rights based on charters. But this 
process threw the power into the hands of oli- 
garchies. The families of wealth and ability 
perpetually maintained their power. Nether- 
lands, being an aggregation of cities, never be- 
came a genuine political unity, in spite of the 
genius of William of Orange. 

The author does not bring out clearly — any 
more than did Motley, who was under the spell 
of Hoofdt and Wagenaar — the contention of 
the Calvinists and Orangeists, as against the 
Arminians and Regents, in the great struggle 
between State-rights and Union, led on the one 
side by Bameveldt and on the other by the 
military son of William the Silent. The people, 
or the Orangeists, emphasized the idea of the 
nation. The brilliant and able Bameveldt laid 
stress on the power of the States, the cities, and 
the power-holding aristocrats. The national 
idea triumphed over possible secession ; but no 
master-mind like that of William of Orange, 
who was a Unionist in both religion and poli- 
tics, led the Dutch into true national unity. Two 
centuries of a weak federalism, and the absorp- 



tion of individuals and corporations in the pur- 
suit of wealth at the expense of national unity, 
with the final humiliation of the Netherlands in 
being first ignored by the Powers and then con- 
quered by France, were necessary to make the 
Dutch realize how much they needed a cen- 
tralized government and a true head of affairs. 
In a word, the monarchy more than fulfilled 
the hopes of the republic. 

In developing his story, or rather his argu- 
ment in behalf of British federation, Mr. Barker 
first shows the natural condition and resources 
of the Netherlands in shaping the character and 
history of the Dutch, and the upbuilding of the 
new world on the ruins of feudalism. Devas- 
tated by Spain, the Dutch Republic was created 
with blood and iron, but the Netherlands 
obtained the rank of a great Power. In time, 
too much home-rule brought on administrative 
chaos. Then party strife, arising from the ab- 
sence of a written constitution, weakened the 
country. While wealth increased, the army was 
allowed to sink into decay. The author even 
holds that the Netherlands treasonably aban- 
doned their ally, France, and allowed the party 
of disintegration to become all-powerful in the 
commonwealth. The English attacked and de- 
feated the Dutch, gained the control of the seas, 
and took the Dutch colonies. Nevertheless, 
incurably selfish politicians in the Netherlands 
utilized defeat to strengthen their own position. 
Affairs went from bad to worse. In the end, 
under the blows, economic, military, and naval, 
of England and France, the Netherlands sank 
into insignificance — a monimient to the folly 
of her self-seeking politicians. 

Mr. Barker's style is bright and vivid. His 
references to authorities are numerous, and 
there is an excellent analytical index of thirty- 
six pages. The book is well worth reading by 
Americans interested in the study of national 
federation and state-rights.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



Recent Poetry.* 



The poetic drama is proving every year more 
attoactive to our younger writers of verse, and the 
unfortunate deadlock between poetry and the En- 
glish stage seems on the point of being broken. 
As long as theatrical managers maintained their 
nonpossumus attitude, rejecting with contumely the 
overtures of poets, the situation was hopeless, for 
such poets as wished to write in the dramatic form 
were offered no incentive to take stagecraft into 
consideration. But the situation is now considerably 
changed. Poetry, modern poetry, on the stage has 
been shown by such men as Mr. Stephen Phillips 
and Mr. Percy Mackaye to be at least a practicable 
affair, and the encouraging word has gone forth that 
even the commercialized and syndicated theatre 
has become amenable to an artistic appeal. One of 
the most promising of the younger poets who have 
heard this word of cheer is Mr. Ridgely Torrence, 
whose " Abelard and H^loise" we may now read in 
a book, and ere long, we are given to understand, 
may also witness in performance. His subject is 
one of the best that history can offer to the dramatist 
who has in his composition some infusion of psy- 
chology. The difficulty of dealing with one criti- 
cal situation in this poignant love-romance of the 
twelfth century has preserved the subject from 
over-exploitation, and left Mr. Torrence a fairly 
fresh field for his endeavor. He disposes of the 
difficulty in question with a single effective line, 
dramatically placed, and the rest of his course is 
plain sailing. There are four acts, the first two 
being separated from the others by a score of years. 
The first half of the work gives us the Paris School 
and Fulbert's villa, the second half the Paraclete 
and Chalons. The dramatic handling of the story 
is spirited and rapid — too rapid, in fact, to permit 
of those purple patches of poetry that the reviewer 
likes to reproduce. When our dramatic poets have 
enjoyed their new franchise for a while, we hope 
that they will grow less timid, and recognize the

tirade as a legitimate feature of even the acting 
drama. The French stage, through three centuries 
of glorious history, has demonstrated to all but the 
mechanicians of dramatic writing that the long 
speech has as much right to exist as the choppy 
dialogue. Twenty-tliree lines is the extreme limit 
of Mr. Torrence's daring, and upon two occasions 
he permits a character to discourse at that length. 
Neither of these passages wUl serve us for quota- 
tion, however, and we must illustrate the quality of 
the verse by means of an excerpt from the scene of 
the lovers' meeting in after years. 

HfiLOISE. 

" Love, bring back your eyes, think on us two. 
Think how the morning and the evening are, 
How they are lovely when we look together. 
Think how the dawn has found us glad of Love, 
Think how the noon has looked upon us glad, 
How the night's pulse has grown to be one bird, 
Dripping its music on our double souls, 
Melting them to one song. Why, the whole earth 
Is like a banquet spread before our love, 
And I shall wait upon you, you shall see. 
Your bread shall be my tender services ; 
I '11 win the golden apples of the west, 
Out of my mighty willingness for you. 
Each dawn shall be a silver cup for you ; 
Oh, let me hold it, I am strong enough. 

Abelabd. 

" So, there 's no help. Empty and waste and void. 
You only offer me this piteous table. 
Do you not see what mocking feast is Life ? 
Wherein one finds the goblets like as selves, 
Bitter, black wine. And floating motes for food ; 
How one sits with the sneering life around him 
Only to pass unquenchftd with a groan ? 
How he who deeply supped for living — dies ? 
And he who hoped for death in his cup — lives ? 

[He moves away.^ 
And all are troubled with the last year's flies? " 

This passage may be taken as representing Mr. 
Torrence's diction at its best. It is not without 
infelicities, verbal and rhythmical, but its movement 
is, on the whole, stately and impressive. 

" The Coast of Bohemia " is a volume of verse 
by Mr. Thomas Nelson Page. Mr. Page is neither 
a lyrist nor a prophet, but he is a highly accom- 
plished man of letters, and so trained a hand as his 
could hardly fail to produce creditable work, even 
in the unwonted medium of rhyme and rhythm. 
We make one selection from the titular poem. 

" There is a land not charted on all charts ; 
Though many mariners have touched its coast, 
Who far adventuring in those distant parts, 
Meet shipwreck there and are forever lost ; 
Or if they e'er return, are soon once more 
Borne far away by hunger for that magic shore. 



" One voyager charted it for every age, 
From azure rim to starry mountain core. 
A nameless player on the World's great stage, 
He spread his sails, adventured to that shore, 
And reared a pharos with his art sublime. 
Like Ilion's song-wrought towers, to beacon every clime.

" There rest the heroes of lost causes lorn, 
On their calm brows more fadeless chaplets far 
Than all their conquerors' could e'er adorn, 
When shone effulgent Fame's ascendant star ; 
There fallen patriots reap the glorious prize 
Of deathless memory of their precious sacrifice." 

The thought of this poem recalls vividly "The 
Isles," one of the happiest achievements of Mr. 
Charles G. D. Roberts. "There is for the minor 
poet also a music that the outer world does not 
catch — an inner day which the outer world does not 
see. It is this music, this light which, for the most 
part, is for the lesser poet his only reward." Thus 
runs Mr. Page's apology for his intrusion into the 
singer's realm. Combined with the evidences of 
poetic sensibility which his volume affords, the ex- 
cuse is quite sufficient. 

" Easter-Song " is the latest of the small books of 
verse that Mr. Clinton ScoUard puts forth in such 
numbers. It is a collection of some twoscore " Lyrics 
and Ballads of the Joy of Spring-time," which may 
be fairly represented by " The Green o' the Year." 

" O the green o' the year, the green o' the year. 
When the blossom bursts on the jonquil-spear, 
And the wild-phlox lifts the blue of its eye 
Up to the blue of the brooding sky ; 
When every wafture of morning brings 
A sense of the fragrant heart of things ! 
O the world is sweet and life is dear 
In this, the green o' the year ! 

" O the green o' the year, the green o' the year. 
When the lyric of earth is the song we hear. 
When rapture breathes from the lowliest weed, 
And the creed of joy is the common creed ; 
When nature thrills to the soul of the sod 
With the kindling touch of the smile of God ! 
O the world is sweet and life is dear 
In this, the g^een o' the year." 

"Sicut Patribus, and Other Verse," is a collec- 
tion of poems by Mr. Oscar Fay Adams. The noble 
motto of the parent puritan commonwealth provides 
a title, not only for the volume as a whole, but also 
especially for the Phi Beta Kappa poem with which 
it opens. The poem, read on Bunker Hill Day, is 
good anti-imperialist doctrine, and as such we give 
it welcome. 

" Not mine, not mine the hand to sweep the strings 
With note triumphal, on this hallowed day. 
I am no prophet to foretell smooth things. 

Or choose a nation's glory for my lay. 
The time for paeans is not yet, or past ; 

Rather the shuddering call that strikes us dumb, 
When, unto consciences aroused at last. 
The mutterings of a grim to-morrow come. 
These be no times for lightsome song : 
The shadow of a mighty wrong 
Darkens the path before, 
Clings like a mist behind ; 
We crouch, who stood of yore ; 
We grope, who now are blind. 
Alas for us ! the sons of patriot sires, 

Breathing the air of freedom from our birth. 
Who might have kindled in far lands the fires 

Of liberty, transfigurer of earth ; 
Who might have raised a grateful people up 
To drain deep draughts from freedom's brimming cup ; 
Who might have shown them the sure way to peace — 
Alas for us ! who did no deeds like these." 



This poem is a worthy pendant to Mr. Moody's 
" Ode in Time of Hesitation," and will be grateful 
to all who feel the shame of the intolerable wrong 
done by our nation to freedom since the dark day 
when we foreswore our principles and became even 
as other nations in our disregard for the rights of 
man. This titular poem is followed by a group of 
dignified compositions suggested by the English 
cathedrals. The tomb of William of Wykeham 
inspires this question of the builder's shade : 

" Dost somewhere rest, as this thy marble rests. 
Or art thou, builder-bishop, evermore 
Striving in other fields, in nobler toil, 
, Serenely glad the while as one that sees 

From some high place, untouched by time, past good 
Grow ever vaster as the centuries fall ? " 

We must also find space for the lines tributary to 
the memoi'y of Horatio Nelson Powers, whom our 
older readers will remember as a valued contributor 
to these pages. 

" Death hath no power o'er such as he ; 
The fulness of the life to be 
Shone round him in the life he spent 
Within this mortal prison pent. 
Texts might we gather from his looks 
Such as men read in holy books. 
And in his speech could hear at will 
The Master's gracions accents still." 

A second offering of "Post-Laureate Idylls" fills 
the closing pages of this book of sincere and 
thoughtful verse. 

We have already spoken of one important Amer- 
ican contribution to the poetical drama; another 
such work of comparable importance now claims our 
attention. " Lords and Lovers, and Other Dramas " 
is the title, and the author is Mrs. Olive Tilford 
Dargan. The titular drama is a reproduction, re- 
markable alike in spirit and in diction, of the 
Elizabethan manner ; of the two •' other dramas," 
" The Shepherd " is a prose tragedy of contempo- 
rary Russia, "The Siege" (again in verse) is a 
Sicilian tragedy of the age of the younger Dionysius. 
A first glance thus shows the author to be a woman 
of high and varied ambition ; a closer inspection 
reveals powers of no mean order in her work. Turn- 
ing now to " Lords and Lovers," it is discovered to 
be a work having for its scene thirteenth century 
England, and for its characters the youthful Henry 
the Third and the g^eat lords temporal and spiritual 
whose ambitions menace his royal prerogatives. The 
plot is strongly dramatic in construction, and the 
scenes are shifted with a truly Elizabethan disregard 
of the practical conditions of the modern stage. So 
far, of course, any reasonably informed writer might 
do as well as Mrs. Dargan has done, but the case 
is different when we come to consider her poetic 
diction. One has but to skim over the pages to 
discover passages that arrest the eye, such, for ex- 
ample, as : 

" The heavenly amaranth alone can dew 
Her brow with life."

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



" When I am with thee 't is continual Spring, 
For in my heart is sach sweet jugglery 
Each winter-ragged month doth put on May." 

" Knowledge, rude defiler of our dreams, 
How oft we 'd give thy hard, substantial store 
To build again with bright illusion's eye 
Our happy towers on the inconstant clouds." 

Nor are longer passages of sustained beauty lacking. 
Our own long extract shall be, however, from the 
Syracusan drama, from the scene in which Aratea 
well-nigh yields to the passion of Aristocles, although 
she is wedded to his friend. 

" Aristocles. Come now, O now, else are we cast apart 
Far as the dismal Night heaves her vast sigh, 
Far as the laboring Chaos breathing blows, — 
Perchance to hurl eternally about 
The farthest stars that from opposed heavens 
Dart fiery scouts that die ere they have met 
So long their journey is. Or, gloomier fate. 
Condemned sit like stones that once could weep 
Forever in the cave of ended things 
That deep in some immortal Lemnos lies 
Nor ever opens its dank gates to day ! 
O, come ere we are lost ! Be thy fair arms 
The rainbow girdle to this longing storm 
And its rude breast will pillow thee as soft 
As Leda when, cool-rocked on lily couch 
The great down-bosomed god swam to her love ! 
Come, Aratea, hebrt of life ! O now 
This pulse speaks back to mine — this bosom throbs 
Like heaven's Artemis unto her own ! 

[Kisses Aer.] 
O kiss that holds the mornings of all time. 
And dewy seasons of the ungathered rose. 
Plant once again thy sununer on my lips ! " 

Such verse as this leaves no room for criticism. It 
bears the visible mark of the divine gift, and there 
is no poet of our time who might not be proud to 
claim it for his own. 

The story of the woman taken in adultery is the 
theme of *' Night and Morning," a narrative poem 
in blank verse by Mrs. Katrina Trask. The story 
is told with picturesque beauty and adorned with 
happy imagery. Avowedly a didactic composition, 
the poem is nevertheless deeply mo\dng, and its 
spiritual message is high and clear. The following 
text, from the scene in which the woman is brought 
before Christ for judgment, embodies the essential 
teaching of the work. 

" Her new-born spirit saw beyond the hour — 
Immortal life, indeed, is not fulfilled 
In the fulfilling of a dear desire ; 
There are supremer issues than the flesh — 
Life's glory lieth in the victory 
Of living spirit over mortal flesh." 

The poem offers an effective protest against the 
moral anarchy of the modern world. 

A memory of Italy, as embodied in the pair of 
quatrains entitled " Girgenti," may be taken to 
illustrate the quality of " The Days That Pass," by 
Miss Helen Huntington. 

" The vision lingers still within my brain ; 
I sometimes see, though shut in city room, 
That far, sweet comer of the world again : 
The temples rising from the almond bloom. 



" The early morning lights on plain and town. 
The golden convent walls and still blue sea. 
The distant mountains with their snowy crown, 
And all my heart cries out for Italy." 

Many hearts will echo to that cry. This little poem 
is one of about half a hundred, all thoughtfully 
fashioned and delicate in expression. 

A memory of Italy, hallowed by association with 
the best-beloved of English poets, will do as well as 
anything to represent the collection called by Mrs. 
Dreyfus " In Praise of Leaves." " Villa Magni " 
is the name of the piece. 

" There have I stood, and chastened by his name, 
With silence knelt — a shadow at a shrine ; 
There have I given thanks, while breezes brine 
Murmured monotonies of youth and fame. 
Like votive anthems droned with soul aflame ! 
There have I wandered, while the memoried air 
Whispered of dreams evasive, sadly fair. 
Of crystal faith earth could not crush or tame. 
Surely within these walls there lurks some trace 
Of that white spirit lingering there awhile, 
Some promise of a song — some cloudy grace 
Hid there to presage weary men a smile. 
Some touch of that divinity they knew. 
When Shelley passed imparadised from view." 

Of this volume, as of the one mentioned just before, 
we may say that its contents — numbering nearly a 
hundred lyrics and sonnets — offer upon every page 
the evidences of a delicate artistic sensibility. 

Beginning with a Morality and ending with a 
Nativity, the latest volume of poems by Mr. Arthur 
Symons gives us several gi-oups of pieces inspired 
in about equal degree by nature and by art. They 
strike no notes not already familiar to his readers, 
and in them he reveals, as heretofore, an extraor- 
dinarily sensitive temperament and a fine artistic 
sense of the fitness of words. Something like a 
creed appears to be formulated in the "Hymn to 
Energy." 

" Let every man be artist of his days. 
And carve into his life his own caprice ; 
And, as the supreme Artist does not cease 
Labouring always in his starry ways, 
Work without pause, gladly, and ask no man 
If this be right or wrong ; man has to do 
One thing, the thing he can ; 
Work without fear, and to thyself be true. 

" Thou art, as God is ; and as God outflows 
Weaving his essence into forms of life, 
And, out of soul perfection's lovely strife, 
Marries the rose's odour with the rose. 
So must thou of thy heavenly human state, 
And of thy formless strife and suffering. 
Thyself thyself create 
Into the image of a perfect thing." 

This, it seems, is the new categorical imperative. 
It sounds plausible, but somehow is not as clear-cut 
and convincing as some of the older formulae. There 
are exquisite things in this volume, lyrical and medi- 
tational, and there is a graver burden, as of satiety, 
than we have been wont to find in the work of the 
poet. 

Mr. Davidson's new volume gives us a further 
group of London eclogues, a few lyrics, and a prose

« Note on Poetry." " Holiday " is the title of the 
book, and also the titular poem. It is a lyrical 
autobiography of the human spirit through several 
incarnations. 

" Twenty centuriea of Pain 
Mightier than Love or Art, 
Woke the meaning in my brain 
And the purpose of my heart. 

" Straightway then aloft I swam 

Through the mountain's sulphurous sty : 
Not eternal death could damn 
Such a hardy soul as I. 

" From the mountain's burning crest 
Like a god I come again, 
And with an immortal zest 

Challenge Fate to throw the main." 

The " Note on Poetry " is an eloquent argument for 
English blank verse as " the subtlest, most power- 
ful, and most various organ of utterance articulate 
faculty has produced." In the closing passage of 
this " Note," Mr. Davidson, after a tribute to Poe, 
enlarges upon America in general, and makes it evi- 
dent that he has been " seeing things." " America 
is the decadence of Europe. Chivalry reappears 
there in the tyranny of pretty women and the liberty 
of divorce. Religion becomes a coarse sentimental 
pietism, and revisits us with an impudent stare in 
the face in the form of Moody and Sankey ; our 
splendid robbers, Clive, Hastings, Rhodes, degen- 
erate there into the pickpockets of the Trusts ; there 
the Celt flourishes, and the negro is burned alive. 
I find all that in ' Ulalume,' and ' The Haunted 
Palace.' " Gracious ! 

Mr. Alfred Noyes is a poet now in his twenty- 
eighth year, an Oxonian and an athlete, who has 
been writing verse since his undergraduate days. 
Five volumes now stand to his credit, besides the 
"Poems" which now introduce him (with Mr. 
Mabie for a sponsor) to the American public. New 
pieces and selections from the earlier volumes make 
up the contents of this collection, which acquaints 
us with a singer whose note is both fresh and vital. 
We will turn straightway to quotation, and begin 
with a stanza from the ode to "The Passing of 
Summer." 

" What though the throstle pours his heart away, 
A happy spendthrift of uncounted gold, 
Swinging upon the blossomed briar 
With soft throat lifted in a wild desire 

To make the world his May, 
Ever the pageant through the Gates is rolled 
Further away ; in vain the rich notes throng 
Flooding the mellow noon with rapturous waves of song." 

This is the note of Arnold's "Thyrsis," almost the 
note of Keats. Our next quotation shall be a son- 
net, " Venus Disrobing for the Bath." 

" Over the firm young bosom's polished peaks 
The thin white robe slips dimly as a dream 
Slowly dissolving in the sun's first beam : 
Far off the sad sea sighs and vainly seeks 
The abandoned shell that bore her to the Greeks 
When first she slumbered on the sea-blue stream, 
And in the dawn's first faint wild golden gleam 
The white doves woke her with their soft red beaks. 



From breast to sunny thigh the light silk slips 
On every rose-white curve and rounded slope 
Pausing ; and now it lies around her feet 

In tiny clouds : now timidly she dips 

One foot ; the warm wave, shivering at her sweet, 
Kisses it with a murmur of wild hope." 

The purity of this exquisite picture is as noteworthy 
as its beauty. How differently a sensualist would 
have colored it! By way of contrast, our tax shall 
now be levied upon the merry ballad of the " Forty 
Singing Seamen," for Mr. Noyes has a vein of 
fantastic humor no less marked than his feeling for 
every mode of the beautiful. These adventurers 
found their way to the land of Prester John, and 
beheld many wonders, including the Phoenix. This 
is the veracious chronicle of what happened to them 
on their search for the fountain of youth. 

" So we thought we 'd up and seek it, but that forest fair 
defied us — 
First a crimson leopard laught at us most horrible to see, 
Then a sea-green lion came and snifPed and licked bis chops 
and eyed us, 
While a red and yellow unicorn was dancing round a tree I 
We was trying to look thinner, 
Which was hard, because our dinner 
Must ha' made us very tempting to a cat o' high degfree ! 
Cho. — Must ha' made us very tempting to the whole 
menarjeree ! " 

After these and sundry other experiences no less 
wonderful, the mariners returned to London-town. 
The note of skepticism struck in the closing stanza, 

" Could the grog we dreamt we swallowed 
Make us dream of all that followed ? " 

does not seriously interfere with enjoyment of the 
story. There is so great a variety offered by these 
poems that we have only begun to give them a fair 
representation. With the verses called "Art," we 
may become deeply serious again, and reluctantly 
close the volume. 

" Beyond ; beyond ; and yet again beyond ! 
What went ye out to seek, oh foolish-fond ? 

Is not the heart of all things here and now ? 
Is not the circle infinite, and the centre 
Everywhere, if ye would but hear and enter ? 

Come, the porch bends and the great pillars bow. 

" Come ; come and see the secret of the sun ; 
The sorrow that holds the warring worlds in one ; 

The pain that holds Eternity in an hour ; 
One God in every seed self-sacrificed, 
One star-eyed, star-crowned universal Christ, 

Re-crucified in every wayside flower." 

There is an excellent device in " A Poet's Prayer," 
which heralds " The Worker, and Other Poems," by 
Mr. Coningsby WUliam Dawson. 

" Give me to sing the songs that must be sung ; 
Not vagrant echoes of the thing last said. 
Nor lamentable words caught up among 
Hollows where leaden skies are splashed with red, 
And startled eyes strain at departing day 
O'er barren lands where Autumn hath begun." 

One would expect cheerful strains after such an invo- 
cation as this, and it is something of a surprise to find 
the autumnal note predominant in what follows. For,

instead of the word of hopefulness and cheer, Mr. 
Dawson brings us the message of life's grinding 
misery, of the evanescence of joy, and of the chasten- 
ing ministry of suffering. We quote from what he 
says, " As for the Dead," noting that it seems to be 
a reply to Baudelaire's plea,

Lea morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleure,"

elegy. 

" Why should we pluck fresh flowers for our dead, 
And add new death to that which went before ? 
We shall not ease them with our posies, nor 
Shall we repose them with the tears we shed, — 
For they are dead. 

" The poor dead cannot smell the blooms we bring, 
For they are still, and straight, and very cold. 
And have no knowledge of the way we fold 
Earth's tender mantle round them slumbering. 
Nor love we bring. 

" Whether their graves lie far apart and bare, 
Or scattered through the ocean's restless sand. 
Or intimate with lilac and garland 
Of God's wild rose, they may not choose to care 
What pains we bear." 

The name of Garneau is an honored one in French- 
Canadian literature. Francois - Xavier Garneau's 
" Histoire du Canada " is a standard work that 
has long been prized for its substantial excellence. 
Alfred Garneau, the son of the historian, was a poet 
of considerable accomplishment, and his verse, now 
posthumously collected, has been published by his 
son, Mr. Hector Garneau, who is also engaged in edit- 
ing a definitive annotated edition of his grandfather's 
" History." The volume of " Poesies," by Alfred 
Garneau (who died in 1904), represents the literary 
diversions of a man of affairs. The composition of 
these poems covered a period of half a century, and 
the number of pieces is nearly equal to that tale 
of years. We quote the lines written " Devant la 
Grille du Cimetlere." 

" La tristesse des lieux sourit, I'heure est exquise' 
Le couchant s'est charg^ des derni^res couleurs. 
Et devant les tombeaux, que I'ombre idealise, 
Un grand souffle mourant soulfeve encor les fleurs. 

" Salut, vallon sacr4, notre terre promise ! 
Les chemins sous les ifs, que peuplent les paleurs 
Des marbres, sont muets; dans le fond, une %lise 
Dresse son dome sombre au milieu des rongeurs. 

" La lumi^re au-dessus plane longtemps vermeille — 
Sa b§che sur I'^paule, contre les arbres noirs, 
Le fossoyeur repasse, it voit la croix qui veille. 

" Et de loin, comme it fait sans doute tous les soirs, 
Get homme la salue avec un geste immense — 
Un chant tr6s doux d'oiseau vole dans le silence." 

The grave note of contemplative melancholy heard 
in these lines is characteristic of the majority of the 
pieces. But the poet had- also lighter notes at his 
command, and occasionally more virile ones, as in 
the song of the " Porte-Drapeau," inspired by the 
Fenian invasion of his country. Here is the closing 
stanza of this martial composition : 



" Victoire ! . . . des hommes perfides 
Voulaient envahir nos foyers ; 
Le ciel punit les fratricides, 
Nous avons fait cent prisonniers ! 
Victoire ! . . . nos jeunes milices 
Ont eu le baptSme du feu, 
L'enseigne est troupe au milieu. 
Pour moi, j'aurai deux cicatrices! 

" H^ros de Chateaugay, heros de Carillon, 
Voyez comme vos fils ehassent I'invasion ! "

Briefs on New Books. 



New edition of The third volume of Grove's " Dic- 
Grove's Diction- ti^nary of Music and Musicians," 

aryofmuttc J -r a t^ n ■««- • i i 

and musicians, edited by Mr. J. A. r uUer Maitland, 
fully sustains the reputation of its two predecessors 
for accuracy of historical statement, comprehensive- 
ness of scope, and conservatism of criticism. In all 
these qualities it is a conspicuous testimonial to the 
expert editing and musical scholarship of Mr. Mait- 
land. It must be conceded, indeed, with all respect 
to the ability of the late Sir George Grove as a mu- 
sical connoisseur, that the new edition, even apart 
from additions, is a distinct improvement over the 
old one. There were several errors arid numerous 
omissions in the latter which necessitated the publi- 
cation of another volume as appendix to the original 
four. Of course it was not a heinous offense. Even 
with all the care bestowed upon the revised edition, 
this third volume gives two pages of addenda and 
corrigenda for volume two, showing the almost in- 
numerable difficulties which beset the compiler of a 
musical dictionary. This standard work has already 
been so fully reviewed in our columns, both as to the 
matter and the manner of treatment, that it is only 
necessary now to call attention to the contents of 
Volume III., which begins with the name of Joseph 
Maas and closes with that of Louisa Pyne — two 
names which call up old memories of opera in Chi- 
cago, for Maas the tenor came here with the Kellogg 
troupe in 1874, while Louisa Pyne with her English 
opera troupe was here as early as 1855. '' But 
where are the shows of yester-year ? " There are 
thirteen articles in this volume which have almost 
text - book comprehensiveness, viz, " Madrigal," 
"Mass," "Mendelssohn," "Modes and Modula- 
tions," "Mozart," "Notation," "Opera," "Oratorio," 
"Organ," "Musical Periodicals," "Piano," "Plain 
Song," and " Psalter." The biographies of Mozart 
and Mendelssohn, having a few additions, are repro- 
ductions of these in the old edition, but it will appear 
singular to most students that 110 pages are allotted 
to Mendelssohn and only 31 to Mozart. This is to 
be explained, probably, by Sir George Grove's pre- 
dilections for the former. The article " Opera " has 
been enriched by an excellent sketch of opera in the 
United States. The American items in this volume 
are an admirable life-sketch of poor MacDowell, 
also of Lowell and William Mason, Emma Nevada,

about women. which are interesting, show diligence, 
and bring together material of considerable value. 
He has facility in stringing liis beads together, is 
discreet in committing himself to no positive view, 
and carefully avoids the sifting of matter, statement 
of original ideas, or promulgation of theory. His 
usual qualities are admirably displayed in his latest 
work " Folklore of Women " (McCIurg & Co.). Its 
matter is drawn, he tells us, from " legendary and 
traditional tales, folk-rhymes, pi'overbial sayings, 
superstitions, etc." In reality, far the larger part is 
from the proverbs ; and the proverbial philosophy of 
every time and every clime has found a vast field 
for expression in dealing with women. He presents 
Arabic, Hindustani, Assamese, Armenian, Kashmiri, 
Singhalese, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese and other pro- 
verbs, besides those of European peoples. Unless, 
however, he studies the peculiar features of life and 
thought of these stranger peoples, which must be 
known in order that their proverbs may be under- 
stood, little is gained by the mere repetition of the 
proverbs themselves. In fact, repetition without 
such explanation is often more misleading than help- 
ful. The graceful stringing together of all sorts of 
proverbs relative to women, the connecting phrases 
being meaningless and contributing neither thought 
nor explanation, produces a literary patchwork which 
makes pleasant reading but does not have the value 
of a carefully arranged and classified collection, 
wherein the proverbs were grouped or sub-grouped 
by races and with no connecting text. Our author 
divides his material into twenty-seven chapters, 
under such titles as " Woman's Beauty," " Woman's 
Eyes," "Woman's Tongue," "Red-haired Girls," 
" Woman's Will," " Woman's Curiosity," etc. Much 
suggestive material is presented that deserves dis- 
cussion. The final chapter, on " My Lady's Walk," 
is interesting. The term, as one of general applica- 
tion, seems to be of our author's own suggestion, 
and he introduces the chapter with these words : 
" Associated with many of our historic houses and 
romantic spots, ' My Lady's Walk ' perpetuates the 
memory, not infrequently, of tradition of a tragic 
and legendary kind, some of which belongs to 
incident bound up with the seamy side of family 



romance." In this chapter also we have mere bead- 
stringing. If we seem to have given our author 
scant praise, it is not because he fails to present 
interesting matter, but because he fails to deal with 
it as he might. "

of the career poleon. King of Elba" (Lippincott), 
of Napoleon. ^jjg jg conscious mainly of being 
curious to see how the fallen monarch managed the 
situation so that it did not suggest comedy. It is 
true that in the Treaty of Fontainebleau the island 
is first styled a " residence " and only later a "Prin- 
cipality." But Napoleon possessed it in full sov- 
ereignty, and felt the necessity of maintaining for 
his protection, against the Barbary pirates if against 
no one else, a miniature army and navy. This do- 
main, twelve miles by seventeen, he had exchanged 
for an empire reaching from the Baltic to the fron- 
tier of Naples and strengthened by a borderland of 
dependent states. Perhaps the contrast was tragic 
enough to divest sovereignty on so small a scale of 
any comic element ; perhaps Napoleon was too ter- 
ribly serious a tyrannical possibility to be amusing 
even when forced to play the royal role on the scene 
of Elba. M. Gruyer thinks this episode has been 
too much ignored by the ordinary historians, whose 
interest remains centred upon the affairs of France. 
He has studied the island and has carefully identi- 
fied the places mentioned in the accounts of Na- 
poleon's stay. He describes these as they are to-day 
and as they were in 1814, supporting his descrip- 
tions with excellent photographs. The body of his 
narrative is made up of an account of the events of 
Napoleon's life from his arrival, in May, 1814, to 
his departure, in February of the next year. It is 
pleasantly written, and the information is drawn 
from good sources ; but it does not impress one as 
equal to the opportunity either in grasp or firmness 
of treatment. — An interesting book to read in re- 
gard to the same phases of Napoleon's career is J. 
Holland Rose's edition of "Napoleon's Last Voyages" 
(Scribner), comprising the voyage to Elba in the 
" Undaunted," as recounted by Admiral Ussher, and 
the voyage to St. Helena on the " Northumberland," 
by John Glover, secretary to Rear Admiral Cock- 
burn. These accounts have been published before, 
the last time in 1895 ; but their value is now in- 
creased by Dr. Rose's notes, and they are embel- 
lished with twenty illustrations taken from contem- 
porary sketches and caricatures.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



The general characteristics and atmosphere of seven- 
teenth-century bookmaking have been reproduced 
with remarkable fidelity ; it is not merely that old- 
time type-faces are used and a contemporary form 
of binding copied, but the actual quality of the work 
itself — the typography, the presswork, the sewing of 
the sheets — speaks eloquently of a day when the 
book was a creation of the artist's hand rather than 
the output of a machine. The first group of six 
volumes is made up of Pepys's "Memoires of the 
Royal Navy," wherein the immortal diarist appears 
to advantage in his official capacity as naval adminis- 
trator; John Evelyn's " Sculptura," an interesting 
by-product of another famous diarist, with a second 
part never before published ; Peacham's " Compleat 
Gentleman," the contribution of a Cavalier school- 
master to the literature of courtesy; Thomas Howell's 
" Devises," a volume of verse which served to make 
less barren the gap in English poetry between Sur- 
rey and Spenser ; Sir Henry Knyvett's " Defence of 
the Realme," the work of an obscure but valorous 
soldier in Elizabeth's service, now for the first time 
printed ; Sir Fulke Greville's " Life of Sir Philip 
Sidney," well known and still holding a secure place 
among books about Sidney. Each of these volumes 
contains an introduction by some capable writer, and 
in the " Sculptura " is a notably fine reproduction in 
photogravure of Prince Rupert's mezzotint. It is 
to be hoped on every account that the " Tudor and 
Stuart Library " will multiply and prosper. 

Ideals of life in an adjective have 
been preached from many a pulpit, 
lay and professional. The simple 
life has been exalted, the happy life encouraged, 
the strenuous life advertised. We have been led 
to consider the value of the experimental life, the 
duty of the dedicated life. Mr. Gulick's plain- 
spoken appeal for the value of "The Efficient Life" 
(Doubleday) is not of this ilk. It is a notably sen- 
sible, frankly practical, and popularly attractive 
statement of some well-established principles of 
healthy mindedness, that, as the Romans told us, 
necessarily requires health of body. Dr. GiUick 
exhibits a welcome versatility in enforcing his cen- 
tral theme of efficiency : brawn is good when it is 
good for something; means are not ends and are 
to be appraised by their subservience to ends. This 
is a tolerant doctrine. One man's way to the end 
is not another's ; and even when the one's meat is 
far from being another's poison, it is not the best 
meat for the second. Know thyself, and act accord- 
ingly. Best of all, the doctrine emphasizes quality. 
Efficiency is not only big and little ; it is high grade 
and low grade. The race-horse and the plough- 
horse have unlike physiologies and markedly unlike 
psychologies. There are thousands of persons who 
do not ask for and are not likely to be benefited by 
profound treatises on the hows and whys of our 
bodily and mental economy. They need plain talks 
for plain people ; yet he who does the talking must 
be inspired by a sound perspective of how such

knowledge is gained and where application is war- 
ranted. To such, Dr. Gulick's pages are admirably 
suited. Common-sense, unfortunately, does not 
seem as soothing or as uplifting as mystic cant to 
sickly minds. But in the end health comes to the 
healthy-minded ; and these will find a fellow-feeling 
in this plain tale of the meaning of efficiency and 
the influences that make for and against it. 

American The autobiogi'aphy of the first presi- 

^teachersT/ ^ent of Swarthmore College, Edward 
nftv years ago. Hicks MagiU, is presented under the 
title "Sixty -five Years in the Life of a Teacher, 
1841-1906 " (Houghton). The work is very un- 
pretentious in style and naive in its simple-hearted 
revelations of the writer's feelings, filial, paternal, 
and professional. Much of the book is of interest 
chiefly to the friends of the man or of the college ; 
yet it is interesting as a whole as the self -revelation 
of a fine character and an interesting personality, 
of a man too deepy absorbed in the service of his 
generation through the training of its youth to care 
for self-advancement or outside interests. Among 
the things that give to the book a value for the gen- 
eral reader are the descriptions of life among the 
Friends of Pennsylvania two generations ago, and 
of the schools and teaching of that day ; the inter- 
esting accounts of two great teachers under whom 
the writer studied. Professor Hadley of Yale and 
President Wayland of Brown University, and of the 
college teaching at that time, with the story of the 
beginnings of the elective system in our colleges 
under the remarkable leadership of President Way- 
land ; and the striking personality of Francis 
Gardner, Master of the Boston Latin School, in 
which Mr. Magill taught for several years, Ac- 
counts of the founding of Swarthmore College and 
of its history occupy a considerable portion of the 

book.

plucky fight against what he appears to have some 
reason for regarding as prejudice and error in the 
generally accepted methods of treating (or neglect- 
ing) eye-diseases and ailments caused by defective 
vision. The public, especially the medical part of 
it, by this time knows something about Dr. Gould's 
pronounced views on eye-strain, its great prevalence, 
its evil effects, and its cure ; and while the perse- 
vering author's latest volumes on the subject have 
not the novelty of their predecessors, they serve to 
strengthen his position by reiteration and added in- 
stances. Many of the chapters are reprints from 
medical and other journals ; and there are but five 
studies (all in Volume IV.) of famous sufferers — 
Balzac, Tchaikovsky, Flaubert, Lafcadio Hearn, and 
Berlioz — more space than usual being given to cases 
in the writer's daily practice. He naturally feels 
some bitterness against his professional opponents ; 
but he should, and evidently does, console himself 
with the reflection that great reformers and discov-

erers and inventors are usually a misunderstood and 
persecuted tribe. It is only by this organized perse- 
cution, under conservative interests, that the fecund 
race of cranks is kept from overflowing the land. 
The innovators that finally triumph have proved their 
fitness to survive — as may be believed will be the 
case with Dr. Gould. The temper of the man com- 
mends itself, as reflected in the following brief quo- 
tation from his pages : " There is more in medicine 
than treating the disease, more than treating the 
patient. The patient is a person, a friend and 
brother, with a past and a future. The classing and 
treating sick human beings exclusively as ' clinical 
material' is an accursed thing and the curse of 

medicine."

literature. ^ series of works " characteristic of 

some aspect of the cultm-e which flourished in 
Western Europe during the period of the Renais- 
sance." The set is called as a whole "The Hu- 
manists' Library," and the first number is made up 
of selections from Leonardo da Vinci's fragmentary 
writings, many of them found mingled with his 
drawings and diagrams ; and to the volume, which 
is entitled " Thoughts on Life and Art," Mr. Lewis 
Einstein, the general editor of the series, has con- 
tributed a short but helpful introduction, while Mr. 
Maurice Baring has done the work of translating. 
The old-time type, especially designed for the pub- 
lishers by Mr. Herbert P. Home, is beautifully 
clear, and also innocent of freakish features. As 
a basis for the text. Dr. Solmi's " Leonardo da 
Vinci: Frammenti Letterari e Storici " (Florence, 
1900) has been used, by permission; but other 
texts have been compared, and a new order has been 
adopted in arranging the paragraphs. The next 
three numbers in this series will be Erasmus's trea- 
tise " Against War," M. Pierre de Nolhac's " Pet- 
rarch and the Ancient World," and Sir Philip 
Sidney's '' Defence of Poesie ; A Letter to Queen 
Elizabeth ; and The Defence of Leicester," — all 
competently edited. A long list of works from 
which future selections will be made has a promis- 
ing appearance in both authorship and editorship. 
The first four volumes may be ordered singly or, at 
a slight reduction, collectively. 

In one sense, the most recent ency 
'2cycio%dias. clopaedia is always the best; and 

" Nelson's Encyclopaedia " is a very 
recent work indeed. We mean by this that the 
work has been prepared in much less time than 
usually goes to such an undertaking. We are in- 
formed that the actual manufacture of the twelve 
stout volumes has been accomplished in less than a 
year, which probably makes a new record for works 
of this class. It is an essentially modern book of 
reference, which means that the men and activities 
of the present day receive an unusually large share 
of attention. This, of course, is at the expense of 
historical information, but for that we can easily 



consult other encyclopaedias fashioned upon a more 
leisurely plan. There is a great profusion of illus- 
tration in these volumes, the first of them alone 
giving us over fifty full-page plates (a dozen of 
them colored) besides hundreds of smaller figures. 
There are three narrow columns of small but clear 
print to the page, which would not be agreeable for 
continuous reading, but has the advantage of pre- 
senting a great deal of matter in compact form. Each 
volume has a useful Appendix of Pronunciation. 
The editorial work has been done under the joint 
direction of Mr. Frank Moore Colby of New York 
and Mr. George Sandeman of Edinburgh. On the 
whole, we think highly of this encyclopaedia, which 
fairly realizes the German ideal of a Konversations- 
Lexicon, and which is published at a price moderate 
enough to place it within the means of a large num- 
ber of readers. 

A name-book ^^ssrs. James T. White & Co. have 
for American Supplemented their "National Cyclo- 
historv. paedia of American Biography " with 

a special volume, edited by Mr. George Derby, 
entitled " A Conspectus of American Biogi-aphy." 
This substantial volume of nearly eight hundred 
pages contains, in indexed or tabular form, an enor- 
mous number of facts so arranged as to make it a 
helpful book of reference. For example, one can 
find in it lists of all the occupants of important 
positions, public or private, throughout the history 
of our country. Among these lists we may mention 
cabinet officers, members of both houses of Congress, 
governors of states, presidents of colleges, bishops 
of various denominations, army officei'S, and editors. 
Then there is an interesting tabulation of poems, 
plays, and novels, in which American historical 
characters figure, a catalogue of public statues in 
the United States, a collection of " notable sayings," 
an " anniversary calendar," and a list of " founders 
of American families and their descendants." A 
large section of the work is filled with indexes, 
both personal and topical, to the Cyclopaedia. A 
classified list of Americans, preeminent in various 
occupations, is another useful feature, but the chron- 
ological arrangement of the names under each cate- 
gory seems to be based upon the date of first 
appearance before the public instead of the date of 
birth. This is a curious method, and yet is not 
without certain advantages. But it is not explained, 
and we have been left to puzzle it out for ourselves.

demanding a list of the purchases he is to make,

some such device as Monsieur Jom'dain employed to 
cover his ignorance of Latin. One is puzzled at Betty 
Lane's having an income of " one gallon of bread 
and one or two shillings a week." Bread sold by 
the yard is not unknown, but the vending of that 
article by liquid measure is, to Americans at least, 
less familiar. However, Miss Hawker is a resident 
of Hants, and in this, as in all other matters treated 
of in her pleasant sketches, she evidently knows 
whereof she speaks.

" Studies iu Greek Allegorical Interpretation," up to 
and including Plutarch, is a doctoral dissertation pre- 
pared for the University of Chicago by Mrs. Anne 
Bates Hersman. 

An "Elementary English Composition," by Mr. Tuley 
Francis Huntington, is a new text-book for children of 
from twelve to fifteen years of age. It is published by

"Fruit Recipes," by Mr. Riley M. Fletcher Berry 
(appropriate name!) is " a manual of the food values of 
fruits and nine himdred different ways of usmg them." 
The book is a publication of Messrs. Doubleday, Page

Stendhal's " Racine et Shakespeare " is an important 
addition to the " Oxford Higher French Series," pub- 
lished by Mr. Henry Frowde. It is edited, with an 
elaborate introduction and very extensive notes, by Mr. 
Leon Delbos. 

« The Rhetoric of John Donne's Verse," by Mr. 
Wightman Fletcher Melton, and " The Ancestry of 
Chaucer," by Mr Alfred Allan Kern, are two doctoral 
dissertations of substantial value which come from the 
John Hopkins University. 

A recent volume of the " World's Classics," published

ford" and "The Moorland Cottage "; another volume 
gives us Dr. John Brown's " Horse Subsecivse," with an 
introduction by Mr. Austin Dobson. 

The " Annual Library Index " for 1906 carries on a 
year further the useful mission of that publication. It 
indexes both current periodicals and books of essays, 
and is edited, as heretofore, by Mr. William I. Fletcher, 
with much professional cooperation. It comes to us 
from the office of the " Pubhshers' Weekly." 

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. publish "An Ency- 
clopaedia of Sicily," by Mr. Douglas Sladen, a book 
which visitors to the Trinacrian isle ought to find indis- 
pensable. There are pictures and maps, and all kinds 



of historical and archaeological information. The same 
publishers send us " The Roman Capitol in Ancient 
and Modern Times," a translation of E. Rodocanachi's 
guide-book by Mr. Frederick Lawton. From the A. 
Wessels Co. we have " Christian Rome," a guide-book 
prepared by Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Cruickshauk upon the 
plan of Grant Allen's well-known series. 

A reissue of Mr. James Bryce's " Studies in History 
and Jurisprudence," first collected six years ago, is 
made timely for American readers by the author's recent 
appointment to the British embassy at Washington. The 
sixteen essays which fill the two volumes of this work 
are weighty studies of fundamental principles. Mr. 
Henry Frowde is the publisher. 

The late Hezekiah Butterworth's " Story of the 
Hymns " and " Story of the Tunes," which have been 
popular books for the past thirty years or thereabouts, 
have now been combined into a single volume, " The 
Story of the Hymns and Tunes," with extensive revi- 
sions and additions. The new work has been done by 
Mr. Theron Brown, and the stout volume, with its two 
dozen portraits, is pubUshed by the American Tract 
Society. 

" Spanish Explorers in the Southern United States " 
is the third volume of the new series of " Original 
Narratives of Early American History," published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. It includes the three 
documents of fundamental importance, Cabe^a de Vaca's 
narrative, the story of de Soto as told by the Gentle- 
man of Elvas, and Castaneda's narrative of Corouado's 
journey. The first and third of these texts are edited 
by Mr. Frederick W. Hodge, and the second by Mr. 
Theodore H. Lewis. 

" An Enemy of the People " and « The Wild Duck " 
make up Volume VIII. in the new edition of Ibsen, 
supervised by Mr. William Archer and published by the 
Messrs. Scribner. Speaking of this edition the other 
day, we ought to have called attention to the fact that 
the " Brand " volume is a reprint of Professor C. H. 
Herford's wonderful translation, a fact which for 
some unexplained reason the publishers have suppressed. 
The natural inference would be to credit Mr. Archer 
with the version, in spite of the astonishing contrast 
between his own wooden translations and this master- 
piece of poetical reproduction. 

It was high time to include a Mozart volume in the 
" Musicians' Library " of the Messrs. Ditson. The 
neglect of that great genius by our fashionable modern 
pianists is one of the most discouraging signs of the 
musical times, because it illustrates the extent to which 
the craze for technique has got the better of musical 
feeling. What famous executant of our day would dare, 
without an apology, to substitute a Mozart sonata for 
the dazzling composition of the latest of Russians that 
is usually the piece de resistance of the programme ? And 
yet, in nine cases out of ten, musical art would gain from 
the substitution and only pedantry or sensationalism 
would lose. Herr Carl Reinecke, who knows his Mozart, 
is the editor of the volume of " Twenty Piano Compo- 
sitions " now published. He has prefaced the volume 
with a sympathetic and highly-intelligent essay, which 
appears in both German and English. The selections 
include four sonatas, four fantasias, three minuets, three 
rondos, and half-a-dozen other compositions, aU gems 
of the purest water. We trust that a volume of Mozart 
arias will soon appear as a companion to this most wel- 
come selection.

[April 16, 



The Magazine Reader's Friend 

TN each monthly issue of What's in the 
Magazines the contents, for the same 
month, of nearly one hundred leading peri- 
odicals are classified, indexed, described, and 
commented upon, — all in the simplest and 
most convenient way imaginable. It makes 
accessible to the busy every-day reader the 
entire mass of current periodical literature 
as it appears. Each issue presents a bird's- 
eye view of the magazines of the month, that 
will give one in five minutes the information 
hitherto to be obtained only by long and 
tedious examination of contents-pages on the 
news-stands. It is a periodical that brings 
the other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so 
must prove indispensable to everyone who 
would keep in touch with current affairs.

A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity. The 
multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment 
to those who try to keep in touch with current literature, and despair was heretofore the portion of 
the m/in who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced. As a handy guide to the things 
one needs or desires, What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest. 

— Bkookxyn Daily Eagle. 

The valvs of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will 
be rapidly appreciated by the student., the teacher, the specialist in any field of research, the general 
reader and the onan of affairs. It is a publication that will admirably supplement -'Poole's Index " 
and the '•'■ Guide to Periodical Literature.'' — Detroit Evening News. 

So great is the reliance placed upon What "s in the Magazines that the busy man and woman 
wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and 
places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader. It is not. however, a 
msre list of contents, nor a complicated index, but ea^h issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine contents of the month. Its valvs to busy men and women is incalculable.

THE MAY CENTURY 

No READER of The Dial should miss the important 
series of articles on " Lincoln in the Telegraph Office " 
which begins in the May Century. It throws new light on 
the most attractive figure in our history, and tells much that 
is new regarding the great leaders of the War. Mr. Lincoln 
spent more of his waking hours, from '61 to '65, in the War 
Department Telegraph Office than in any other place except 
the White House. David Homer Bates, Manager of the War 
Department Telegraph Office, tells the graphic story in this, 
series of articles. 

You will want to own the wonderful picture in color in 
this May Century. It is Sigismond de Ivanowski's marvel- 
lous realization of Blackmore's " Lorna Doone."

SCIENCE A ND LI TERATURE. 

Every now and then the voice of some crit- 
ical Cassandra is heard to prophesy dire things 
concerning the fate of literature. The great 
writers are all dying, and none appear to take 
their places. Civilization is becoming more 
and more material, and idealism is everywhere 
being crowded to the wall. Men look to the 
poets for diversion, but no longer find in them 
the bread of life. Now materialism, as Mr. 
Herbert Paul remarks in a recent " Contem- 
porary " article, " is a good mouth-filling word, 
upon which anyone in search of an explanation 
may seize. What, it might be asked, can you 
expect of a generation which speaks of the 
British flag as an ' asset ' ? Who would now 
reject even a small portion of the world for fear 
of losing his own soid ? " But literature has 
survived the menace of asphyxiation by mate- 
rialism a number of times already, and wiU 
probably continue to do so, however seemingly 
imminent the death-agony. It is not so much 
toward materialism as toward science that we 
shoxdd look for the corrosive influence that now 
imperils aU the arts, literature among them. 
This is the text of Mr. Paul's essay, which has 
for its title the ominous question, " Is Litera- 
ture Dying ? " and which takes a less hopeful 
view of the situation than that which we are 
disposed to advance. 

A few sentences wiU serve to illustrate our 
writer's statement of his case. " The scientific 
spirit seems now to dominate everything. The 
world in future is to be governed from the lab- 
oratory. It used to be said by those of old 
time that science had a definite province, beyond 
which was the realm of literature, conduct, im- 
agination, faith. Modern science seeks to re- 
move the boundaries, to claim all knowledge for 
its province, and to say that what it does not 
know is not knowledge. . . . When, if ever, 
science is finally enthroned as the goddess of 
reason, the one source of real truth here below, 
the arbitress of human destiny, the dictatress of 
the world, literature must gradually subside into 
a tale of little meaning, a relic of the past. 
The legendary mathematician's comment on 
'Paradise Lost' (a very fine poem, but I don't 
quite see what it all goes to prove), may have 



276 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



shown him to be in advance of his age. For though 
' Paradise Lost ' probably numbers more readers 
than the 'Principia,' it has not extended the 
boundaries of human knowledge." This seems 
a plausible argument, but it is based upon a 
fallacious distinction. Let us grant that science 
has aU knowledge for its province ; the admis- 
sion does not in the least impair the claim of 
literature, which has the coequal, if not the 
superior, right to rule over that province by 
virtue of its appeal to the emotional side of hu- 
man nature. Science and literature in their 
relations to one another and to man, simply 
illustrate anew the coordination of temporal and 
spiritual authority that history shows to have 
been workable for many centuries in many 
lands. It is only what theologians style " science 
falsely so-called " that seeks to usurp the place 
of literature ; science truly conceived does loyal 
service to literature by keeping it supplied with 
fresh materials for its shaping agency. Has 
Mr. Paul forgotten his Wordsworth ? Nothing 
truer was ever penned than the famous saying : 
" Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all 
knowledge ; it is the impassioned expression 
which is in the countenance of all science." 

The discouraging conclusion of our essayist's 
argument is formulated in the following series 
of propositions : " There is enough poetry in 
the world already. It must be waste of tipae 
to make more. Science is to literature as life to 
death. To become really scientific is a resur- 
rection. If these views are widely held, more 
widely every day, the question at the head of 
this article must be answered in the affirmative. 
It may be a euthanasia, a gradual and easy 
decay. But it is as certain as it is gxadual." 
We have already stated what seems to be a 
sufficient reason for holding this reckless use of 
the words " must " and " certain " as extremely 
ill-advised. The writer ignores the fundamental 
elements of the problem, and his finding has only 
the narrow support of certain temporary condi- 
tions, of a mere phase in the progress of our 
culture. That phase, we will freely allow him, 
shows us to be suffering just now from the arro- 
gance of positivism and the corresponding defect 
of imagination, from an excess of materialism 
over humanism, of realism over idealism, and of 
the claims of the flesh over those of the spirit. 
As a statement of the existing situation and out- 
look, Mr. Paul's complaint is probably not over- 
drawn, the colors of his picture are perhaps no 
darker than are justifiable. We heartily agree 
with him in his scoring of the present-day evils 
of irreverence and philistinism, and " the crass- 



ness of unidealized prosperity." His list of the 
influences now hostile to literature might be con- 
siderably extended, or at least particularized, to 
even more dismal effect. The degrading uses 
which are made of literature in our educational 
machinery would supply a fruitful theme for 
exploitation. Another would be supplied by the 
unconscionable activities of the commercially- 
minded persons who provide us with a large 
share of the books, and a still larger share of 
the periodicals, that we read. We may, in short, 
find ourselves in substantfel agreement with Mr. 
Paul, or with any other reporter who looks upon 
the present age as one of literary retrogression, 
but we must part company with all such observ- 
ers when they endeavor to persuade us that the 
doom of literature is at last sealed. 

For we have only to look back a hundred 
years or so to discover literature springing radi- 
antly into renewed life from a social and intel- 
lectural soil seemingly as sterile as that of these 
discouraging days in which we live. As Mr. 
Watts-Dimton has pointed out, mankind alter- 
nates between two great impulses, the impulse 
of acceptance, and the impulse of wonder. 
Although science is doing its best to destroy in 
us the impulse to look with wondering eyes upon 
the world, we are by no means in the desperate 
case of our eighteenth-century forbears. Per- 
haps we are yet destined to as low a descent 
before the awakening comes. But if the past 
has any lesson at all for us, it is the lesson that 
the spirit of man, although subdued for a season, 
always contrives to reassert itself, refusing to be 
forever fed upon the husks of mere knowledge, 
demanding also for its full sustenance those 
elements of awe and rapture and reverent faith 
which science alone cannot offer, and which it 
is the holy mission of literature to furnish for 
the famishing soul. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A NATIONAL MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE is the Sub- 
ject of an illuminating essay in Mr. Sidney Lee's recent 
book, " Shakespeare and the Modern Stage." Mr. Lee 
gives the history of the various attempts made by En- 
gland to commemorate her great poet, and marshalls 
all the arguments to show the fitness and necessity for 
such celebration. Particularly does he dispose of those 
projects which would make of a Shakespearean memo- 
rial the tag to some utilitarian purpose — a lectureship 
foundation, a school for actors, or an endowed theatre. 
It is to be feared that England is not yet ready for a 
spontaneous and general tribute to Shakespeare. There 
is no such love for the things of the mind, no such pas- 
sionate adoration for the kings of art, in that country, 
as exist in many other nations or lands. Standing in

Burns's cottage in Ayrshire one can see a continual 
stream of Scotch people flowing in and out, — small 
merchants, farmers, drovers, women and children, — 
and from their wet eyes and trembling lips one can 
gather the force of the feeling which has dotted the 
west of Scotland with magnificent monuments to Burns. 
But nobody goes to Stratford except Americans. En- 
gland is the Martha of nations, careful in material 
matters, careless about ideal ones. For her warriors 
and statesmen she has glorious rewards and gorgeous 
graves. But the " Poets' Corner " of Westminster 
Abbey has a sneering sound. Yet with all her worship 
of success and power she has produced no man of action 
of the first rank, none the world would place level with 
Alexander, Csesar, Charlemagne, or Napoleon. Per 
contra she has produced the supreme creative artist of 
mankind. , , . 

The reference-library idea has been usefully 
applied in establishing the Department of Legislative 
Reference of the city of Baltimore, with Dr. Horace 
E. Flack, a Johns Hopkins graduate, at its head. This 
new municipal department, which began its beneficent 
existence with the opening of the year, is probably 
unique, in this country at least, although Boston and 
Chicago have well-managed and very useful bureaus of 
statistics, and the state libraries of Wisconsin and Cali- 
fornia conduct somewhat similiar departments. Indeed, 
the Baltimore enterprise appears to owe its birth to the 
reference librarian at Madison, Dr. Charles McCarthy, 
a man fertile in ideas and zealous in their dissemination. 
The economic need of municipal and also state and 
national bureaus or departments of legislative reference 
can be readily imderstood ; but for details as to the legi- 
timate functions of these governmental data-gatherers, 
we must, for lack of space, content ourselves with re- 
ferring to the able and, we doubt not, cheerfully com- 
municative head of the Baltimore bureau, or to Miss 
Wallis, his competent assistant and expert cataloguer. 
We may, however, close with one brief illustration of 
the department's usefulness in a small personal matter. 
A lady recently entered Dr. Flack's office with tax re- 
ceipts for 1894 on five lots that she owned in far-away 
St. Paul, and went away rejoicing in the assurance, de- 
rived from the St. Paul comptroller's report for 1906, 
that her property was unquestionably worth $1,500 
more than she had supposed. 

The innate depravity of words, their perverse 
tendency to lose the innocence etymologically belonging 
to them, and to acquire sinister meanings, must have 
struck many a reader of early English literature. It is 
sad to trace the deterioration of one word after another, 
and to note the almost invariable inability or unwilling- 
ness of these reprobates to reform. We are to-day 
witnesses to the lamentable fall of the once innocent 
word graft. From its present abyss of infamy will it 
ever rise again into respectability ? Alas, we fear not. 
For do but note the hopeless condition of its vast com- 
pany of hoary sinners. Tempest (from tempestas, and 
that from tempus) should mean simply season, weather, 
fair or the reverse; but it early took to evil courses, 
and see the result ! Bribe (from briba, a crust of bread 
given in charity ) meant merely a gift down to Chaucer's 
time, and then it too went to the bad. Similar melan- 
choly examples of verbal degeneration are prejudice, 
and prejudicial, egregious, monstrous, chronic (we speak of 
chronic gout, but hardly of chronic happiness), j?rejoos- 
terous, and crude But let us pursue the painful mquiry 



no further. Rather should the rare exceptions be sought 
out and made to cheer us and preserve us from pessim- 
ism. Enthusiasm was formerly (that is, about 1700) 
understood in the sense of delusion, religious mania, a 
following after strange gods. Now it is a highly re- 
spectable word, but so hard-worked that, imless care be 
taken, it too is likely to turn restive and run amuck, 
along with all the other once sober and esteemed but 
now degenerate members of the language. Of the 
word doings, a respectable even if not aristocratic term. 
Dr. Johnson said: " Now only used in a ludicrous sense, 
or in low, mean language." We hail with joy its sub- 
sequent reform. ... 

Xhe last representative of a famous Puritan 
FAMILY, in one of its branches at least, passed away in 
the recent death of Thomas Wigglesworth of Boston, de- 
scendantof the worshipful Michael Wigglesworth (1631- 
1705), Harvard tutor. Maiden pastor for forty-eight years 
and " imshrinking rhymer of the Five Points of Calvin- 
ism," as he is styled by Moses Coit Tyler, who adds that 
he " so perfectly uttered in verse the religious faith and 
emotion of Puritan New England that for more than a 
hundred years his writings had universal diffusion there, 
and a popular influence only inferior to that of the Bible 
and the Shorter Catechism." Wigglesworth's recog- 
nized masterpiece was " The Day of Doom, or a Poetical 
Description of the Great and Last Judgment, with a 
Short Discourse about Eternity," inspiration for which 
was thus invoked of " the Judge of the World " : 

" Thee, Thee alone I '11 invocate ; 
For I do much abominate 
To call the Muses to mine aid." 

Of this fearful creation, rivalling in its vivid horrors 
Jonathan Edwards's hair-raising forecasts of the wrath 
to come. Cotton Mather confidently predicted that it 
would be read in New England until the day of doom 
should itself arrive. Probably not one New Englander 
in a thousand has now any knowledge of the poem, which 
was in its time so popular that it ran through ten editions 
in the colonies, besides being reprinted in the mother 
country. , . , 

Count Tolstoi s peasant critics are emphatic in 
their dissent from his views on Shakespeare, although 
this dissent on the moujik's part is involuntarily ex- 
pressed and has no conscious reference to the late famous 
onslaught on the English poet. A writer in the Paris 
Temps describes a series of Shakespeare readings given 
before a peasant audience. From a Russian collection 
called " Books the People Should Read," — which in- 
cludes two of the denoimced plays, " King Lear " and 
" Hamlet," — three of Shakespeare's tragedies (the two 
just named and " Othello ") were read aloud to a circle 
of humble hearers ; and the interjected comments and 
exclamations, the tears and sighs, the cries of pity and 
of indignation, all eloquently testified to the vivid appre- 
ciation of the strong parts of every act and scene. Eager 
discussion followed each play. In regard to " Lear," 
some thought the old king deserved his fate. " He was 
too domineering," they said, "too despotic; he wished 
every one to bend to him; he was too fond of flattery." 
Others, moved by pity, tried to justify his conduct. 
" He had a good heart," they declared, " only he was 
capricious now and then. How freely he forgave the 
fool for his mocking jests ! He let pride run away with 
him just once, and think how dearly he paid for it! " 
The writer in conclusion expresses his surprise that " the 
illiterate moujik's sensitiveness to the beauty of Shakes- 



278 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



peare's work should have escaped Tolstoi's knowledge; 
for he knows the Russian peasant remarkably well. 
The only explanation for his error is the spirit of opposi- 
tion to everybody else's opinion that Tolstoi has all his 
life so violently manifested."

Less than a dollar a day for teaching is paid 
to school-teachers in seventy-four towns of — what 
state does the reader suppose? Massachusetts! So at 
least Dr. Winship reports, reckoning the pay against the 
three htmdred or more working days of the calendar 
year; and he pertinently asks what can be expected of 
the men and women of the future who are taught by 
persons willing to work for that pittance. Yet the con- 
dition of the school-teacher in this country is still en- 
viable compared with that of teachers in Germany, 
where the saying goes, " Whom the gods hate they make 
pedagogues." The high standard of education required 
of German teachers is well known, as is also the pitiful 
meagreness of their pay. But the equation of demand 
and supply will continue inexorably to work itself out 
in the future as in the past. 

Mr. Ben Greet's mode of presenting Shakespeare, 
for which he has been criticized by Mr. William Winter 
and others, is animadverted upon by Mr. Greet's former 
leading lady. Miss Mathison (of " Everyman " fame) 
in a late number of " The Theatre." The simplicity 
of the Elizabethan stage, she contends, " is impossible 
in a highly complex society like our own; it takes no 
cognizance of the part played in any theatrical produc- 
tion by the audience itself. The Elizabethan stage was 
simple, because Elizabethan audiences were simple; 
they hkd no prior scenic traditions in their blood." 
Whether we are willing or unwilling, fashions in art, 
as well as in dress, demand some degree of subservience 
from him who desires the respectful attention and con- 
sideration of the public.

Thirteen million dollars for cuLTURE,generously 
expended by Mr. Carnegie in one of the least cultured 
of our large cities, is what the magnificent new buildings 
at Schenley Park, on the high ground east of Pittsburg, 
represent in " cold cash." The grand public opening, 
on the tenth of this month, of the Carnegie Institute, 
the Carnegie Technical Schools, and the enlarged Car- 
negie Library, marks an epoch in Pittsburg's history. 
If culture can be bought with a price, the city of steam 
hammers and grimy smoke and internationally famous 
misdemeanants should speedily become the " Athens of 
America," while Boston may be expected to acquire, like 
Greece before it, a mournful interest as a " sad relic of 
departed worth." , , . 

Like the phcenix from its ashes. Helicon Hall is 
to rise with newness of life, as we read, and the Sinclair 
experiment is to receive further trial. Those of an 
earlier, indeed a much earlier, generation will recall the 
burning of the Brook Farm phalanstery almost sixty- 
one years, to a day, before this later unfortmiate event 
of a similar sort. The fire of 1846 proved the death 
blow to an already tottering institution. If Helicon 
Hall has vitality enough to rally from its recent shock, 
it will be a sign of vigor and a good omen for the future. 
The history of communities of this general description 
is a melancholy chronicle of disappointments and fail- 
ures; but ar generous observers are ready to applaud 
a heroic attempt to accomplish the impossible. 



The first draft of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, 
or at least a manuscript appearing to be the first draft 
of that once popular and now neglected romance (why 
do we find it so deadly fatiguing, whereas the Elizabeth- 
ans took delight in it?) has been discovered by Mr. 
Bertram Dobell, the London bookseller and book-writer 
to whom we owe the discovery of Thomas Traherne, 
the unearthing of interesting Lamb literature, and other 
similar services. Some persons never look on the 
ground without finding four-leaf clovers or Indian 
arrow-heads; others never rummage a book-stall with- 
out hitting on rare and unsuspected first editions; and 
still others, the happy-go-lucky majority of mankind, 
never get beyond a confused perception of the outlines 
of more conspicuous objects. 

The scapegrace of story is commonly a more 
attractive character than the scapegrace of reality. In 
a recent prize contest conducted by the London " Truth " 
the following six were found to be the favorite scape- 
graces of English fiction: Dick Swiveller, Falstaff, 
Charles Surface, Micawber, Alfred Jingle, and Tom 
Jones. Only one competitor sent in a list containing all 
six names, and he won the prize. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE "CASE" OF THE NEGRO AMERICAN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Does your reviewer of Finot's " Race Prejudice " 
mean seriously to assert that the Negro American is the 
most difficult " case " in the way of miiversal brother- 
hood ? We have usually been patronizingly informed 
that our advance in America had little to do with the 
case, since we were exceptional, and that the real crux 
of the matter was the origin and destiny of the Afri- 
can Negro. When now there comes an advocate who 
successfully ridicules the pretended inferiority of Afri- 
cans, your acrobatic wiiter gracefully informs us that 
we of America lack " the seal of proof." Is this because 
he knows anything about the Negro American, or be- 
cause he misses in Finot the staring headlines of " Rape " 
and « Lynching." w. E. B. DuBois. 

Atlanta University, April 19, 1907. 

[The closing sentence of our review seems unfor- 
tunately to have suggested a conclusion as remote 
from the intention of the reviewer as of the author 
of the book reviewed. The sentence was intended 
to suggest that the experience of the negro situation 
in America furnishes to the author the most complex 
data and considerations afforded by the juxtaposi- 
tion and assimilation of modes of life of two racially 
most distinct varieties of man. The scope and man- 
ner of M. Finot's treatment indicates that he regards 
the matter as difficult, as worthy of detailed and 
exact analysis. In the reviewer's opinion, M. Finot's 
chapter covering this ground does not carry con- 
viction to the unprejudiced reader. So much differ- 
ence of opinion as is thus implied between the 
reviewer and Mr. DuBois should certainly be no 
barrier to a mutual appreciation of the merits of the 
controversy to which a fiu'ther consideration might 
lead. — Edr. The Dial.]

GERMAN AND AMERICAN READING HABITS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A possible injustice would seem to be done by the 
statement, in your issue of April 1 (page 214), that 
" German and American reading habits are placed in 
instructive comparison by recent reports from two libra- 
ries, one in Germany and one in this country, serving 
communities of about the same size." You then proceed 
to show that the Krupp Library of Essen, Germany, 
recently circulated 388,001 volumes, and that the public 
library of Troy, N. Y., in its latest report gives a cir- 
culation of 62,000, or less than one-sixth as many. In 
fairness it should be pointed out that the American 
library you have chosen for this illustration has a very 
small circulation in proportion to the population of the 
city — less than one volume per capita, whereas a cir- 
culation of from three to seven volumes per capita is 
found in many American towns and cities. At the last 
United States census, Troy had a population of 60,651, 
while Somerville and Springfield, Mass., the next larger 
cities, had populations of 61,643 and 62,059 respectively. 
And the latest reports of the public libraries in these 
cities showed circulations of 391,783 and 381,818 vol- 
umes respectively. 

It may also be pertinent to inquire whether the figures 
given for the circulation of the German library include 
books used in the library as well as those borrowed for 
home use, the latter only being included usually in 
American statistics. American Librarian. 



READING SHAKESPEARE TO CHILDREN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A review of " Fingerposts to Children's Reading," 
in a recent issue of The Dial, takes issue with the 
author in regard to the reading of Shakespeare's simpler 
plays to children nine years old. There is, among 
adults, a wide difference of opinion as to how much 
children can understand. This difference of opinion is 
due chiefly to the difference in children. We are 
prone to regard children as a species and to base our 
judgment of the species upon the particular children 
who may have come under our observation. It is cer- 
tainly as futile to expect every child to be interested in 
Shakespeare at nine years of age as it is to expect every 
man and woman to be interested in Shakespeare. Some 
minds never open to the influence of great poetry, — 
and it is often because they have never been accustomed 
to reading and hearing it. But I wish to make a plea 
for the reading of Shakespeare as soon as the child will 
listen with real interest. I made my own acquaintance 
with the great dramatist when I was seven; and I can 
vividly remember the delight that I had, lying flat on 
the floor with the great old-fashioned family edition of 
the " Complete Works " open before me. My oldest boy 
listened eagerly to " The Merchant of Venice,"" Mid- 
summer Night's Dream," and " The Tempest " at eight, 
and was able to repeat intelligently the story of each. 

I find in my book of clippings an article taken several 
years ago from a well-known periodical, in which a 
mother writes as follows : " One of my pleasures during 
the past two winters has been the reading of Shake- 
speare's plays to a little gathering of four people — three 
of them being my little girl, age nine, and my two 
boys, ages eleven and seven. . . . Interesting comments 
were made as to the way the different characters im- 
pressed them. The older boy listened to all the dramas, 
not being willing to miss anything. The girl missed 



two or three, and the younger boy listened to parts of 
all and to every word of the tragedies." 

Dr. Robert CoUyer mentions Bunyan, Defoe, Gold- 
smith, Shakespeare, and the Bible, as being his meat 
and drink in boyhood; and the influence of these mas- 
ters is evident in his strong, terse style. 

A great danger to the present generation of children 
is in the multiplicity of books written for them. Many 
people have come to feel that children need a literature 
quite distinct from that of grown-ups, and reduced to 
their supposed level. The effects of this " juvenile " 
literature is seen in a weakened mental capacity, and a 
lack of appreciation of what is high and noble. If a 
boy is hungry for a book we give him Henty instead of 
Motley, and Lamb's " Tales from Shakespeare " instead 
of the real thing. The " Tales " are good in their way, 
but they were written as hack-work, and it is doubtful 
whether Charles Lamb, at least, ever took much interest 
in them or any large part in their composition. They 
are only the plots and contain little of the inspiration 
which comes even to children from contact with the 
original dramas. Kate Douglas Wiggin has said : " A 
mere dip into something vast, remote, mysterious, may 
stir the child's imagination and set his mind to work 
on larger lines. ' Man's reach is greater than his grasp, 
else what's a heaven for ? ' . . . We used to think that 
birds flew because they had wings; we now surmise 
that they have wings because they tried to fly." 

I heard, not long ago, in the Forestville school of 
this city, a class of fourth-grade children, about ten 
years of age, reading " Midsummer Night's Dream." 
They read it with expression and with evident appre- 
ciation. Their answers to questions showed that they 
understood it, — not as an adult or as a scholar under- 
stands it, but as a child who is interested in the fairy 
story and touched by the melody of the noble verse. 
They read it from a complete edition of the play, not 
a simplified or emasculated version. I heard an eighth- 
grade class read " Hamlet," recite some of its greatest 
passages, and discuss its characters with as much interest 
as a college literature class, and with more originality, 
if with less profundity. These children are not prigs. 
They play as hard and enjoy their play as much as any 
child, but they love great literature because they have 
seen and felt its beauties. Life not only means more 
to them now, but it will mean more to them in the days, 
to come because they have formed a taste which will 
lead them up and on. 

Mr. William Archer, the distinguished dramatic 
critic, has recently expressed himself as opposed to in- 
troducing Shakespeare to children. He wishes them to 
wait until they reach maturity, and then approach the 
plays as they would approach a new play by Pinero or 
Shaw. This plan doubtless has some advantages. Our 
appreciation of any great work is measured by the 
mental and spiritual equipment with which we approach 
it. But this equipment does not come to us unsought. 
It is gained by reading and by the cultivation of the 
spirit. What shall the child read in order to enable him 
to understand Shakespeare at thirty ? Not the " Elsie " 
books and Amanda Douglas, and Oliver Optic, surely, 
— or any of that peptonized milk diet upon which so 
many are bringing up their families. Here, as in every 
other department of human effort, the child learns to 
do by doing, — and I am constrained to believe that 
the best preparation for understanding Shakespeare is 
Shakespeare. Walter Taylor Field.

A Realistic Study of an Idealist.* 



In a biography from Mr. Thomas Wright's 
busy pen the reader has learned to expect a 
praiseworthy fidness of detail and an agreeable 
manner of presenting it. His " Life of Walter 
Pater " does not disappoint this expectation. 
Every available source of information apjjears 
to have been made contributory to his two 
handsome and lavishly illustrated voliunes ; and 
if his workmanlike methods are not exactly 
those of previous writers who have rhapsodized 
on the life and genius of Pater, the difference 
is not altogether one to be regretted. 

A characteristic preface (Mr. Wright is never 
content to let the end crown the work) sets forth, 
among other things, " twelve principal errors of 
commission and omission 'that the author has 
found in Mr. Benson's study of Pater in the 
" English Men of Letters " series. The earlier 
biographer has asserted that Pater's command 
of language was not the result of much youth- 
ful writing that never saw the light ; that he 
wrote no poetry in boyhood except a few humor- 
ous lines ; that Roman Catholicism in his family 
was of late date ; Harbledown, Pater's home 
during his attendance at the King's School, Can- 
terbury, is not mentioned ; Mr. Benson repre- 
sents Pater as popular in those school days ; he 
makes him " apt to be reticent about his own 
interior feelings "; he leaves unmentioned five 
of Pater's most intimate friends ; he omits 
Pater's connection with St. Austin's " Monk- 
ery "; he makes Pater's chief interest in early 
life to have been philosophy, whereas Mr. 
Wright says it was English literature ; he avers 
that Pater's metaphysical studies did not de- 
stroy his strong religious instinct ; he does not 
spice his narrative with anecdotes, and records 
only two or three uninteresting conversations ; 
and, twelfthly, he declares that Pater wrote 
very few letters. That Mr. Benson was more 
or less in error in most of these particulars, 
some of which are really of little importance, 
is clearly enough proved by Mr. Wright ; but 
the disputed assertion that Pater was " apt to 
be reticent " still remains a safe one to make, 
however much he may have occasionally taken 
his few nearest friends into his confidence. Li 
regard to Pater's chief interest in early life, the 
reader of Mr. Wright's volumes might fairly

volumes. Illustrated. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



maintain that both biographers are in the 
wrong : the preponderating passion in child- 
hood and adolescence appears to have been 
neither philosophy nor English literature, but 
religion. The boy delighted in preaching, both 
his own and that of another, and repeated in- 
stances are given of his excessive church-going, 
up to the time of his only too natural skeptical 
and atheistical rebound, which had its serious 
begimiing at Oxford. The accusation of not 
indulging in anecdotes implies, some will say, 
more praise than blame. Another inaccuracy 
of Mr. Benson's that Mr. Wright rectifies has 
to do with Jowett's justifiable action in pre- 
venting Pater's receiving the coveted proctor- 
ship that had looked so attractive to him, not 
because of its duties, which were wholly uncon- 
genial to the mild-mannered recluse, but because 
of the additional £300 or £350 it would have 
brought to his pocket. 

Previous writers on Pater liave yielded to the 
strong temptation to clothe their thoughts in 
Pateresque language. The graceful little trib- 
ute to him in the " Contemporary Men of 
Letters " series has, among other examples of 
fine writing, a comment on " Diaphaneite ' de- 
claring that " the whole composition moves with 
unwonted resiliency and speed," — that is, with 
unwonted backward-leaping and forward-hasten- 
ing ; unwonted indeed ! Mr. J. R. McQueen, 
an old friend of Pater's whom Mr. Wright is 
the first to draw on extensively, says upon hav- 
ing his attention drawn to this sentence : "I 
am never surprised at anything I read in these 
little memoirs about Pater. The authors seem 
to think fine writing makes up for ignorance 
of facts." Hence a natural satisfaction in meet- 
ing with one memoir of Pater that is a plain, 
straightforward narrative with no attempt to 
make flowers of rhetoric hide a poverty of fa<it. 
Only once is the author caught in the commis- 
sion of something like a Paterism, and that is 
well on in his task. This single instance, from 
the thirty-second chapter, is worth quoting as a 
curiosity. 

" He delighted in high altars banked with flowers — 
the arum, the narcissus, the jonquil — innumerable 
candles forming a pyramid of points of fire, priests in 
transplendent copes stiff with gold, incense rising in 
swelling clouds, bell-ringing, geniiflections." 

Admirers of Pater maj'^ regret that his bio- 
grapher has seen fit to dig and delve for so many 
small matters of fact that, as he presents them, 
do not always redound to Pater's credit. Yet, 
much as the Greeks preferred to take their 
divinities with a plentiful admixture of undivine

attributes, so it soothes our inferiority to detect 
human imperfections in our idols. Mr. Wright 
certainly shows us a very real and mortal and 
fallible man in his book, and even declares he 
might easily have made him more ungodlike 
stiU ; but considerations for others' feelings 
caused the biographer to go through his manu- 
script again and again, striking out " everything 
that seemed likely to give offence," and espe- 
cially omitting " all Pater's jibes at religion." 
Which are worse, we wonder, the scoffer's actual 
jibes or the imaginary ones that his friends are 
thus left to torment themselves with ? But this 
reticence seems misplaced in denying us, and in 
making a virtue of denying us, all account of 
Pater's home life with his sisters at the house 
in Bradmore Road, Oxford, which he occupied 
for seventeen years. 

The boy Pater, as pictured by Mr. Wright, 
was a very abnormal and by no means prepos- 
sessing lad. He would join in no games, and rev- 
elled in uncompulsory church-going, shunning 
most of his mates at school and consorting only 
with a chosen two, the three being known as 
" the triumvirate." Even from these two inti- 
mates he allowed himself to be estranged in his 
Oxford days of religious unbelief. The man 
and scholar is depicted as given to indolence, 
despite his literary enthusiasm for " ascesis," 
and as but superficially versed in even his chosen 
specialties. The glamour of his style, we are 
told, blinds us to the shallowness of his knowl- 
edge. Even as to the outward and physical 
Pater we are repeatedly reminded of his simian, 
prematurely-whiskered appearance in youth, 
and of his heavy, hunch-backed, Dutch ungain- 
liness throughout life. From the chapter on 
" Pater at Fifty " let us quote a few illustrative 
passages. 

" In early portraits of him, taken just after the culti- 
vation of the historical moustache [whereby hangs a 
tale], he has a rather helpless look, nor was he even then 
at all a strong man. In the portrait taken late in his 
life by Messrs. Elliott and Fry, he appears, though little 
over fifty, as bald as a coot, while the moustache has 
grown heavy and truly Bismarckian. ... In these por- 
traits he does not seem so very plain, but the evidence 
of all who knew him is the other way about; moreover, 
he himself was well aware of his shortcomings in this re- 
spect, and regretted them. He loved pictures ; but there 
was one picture which always gave him pain — the one 
which he could see any day in the looking-glass. . . . 
Owing to his feeble health Pater always looked at least 
ten years older than his age; but it was difficult to per- 
suade him to call in a doctor, and he had little faith in 
medicines. No passage in his favourite Montaigne 
pleased him more than the Seigneur's answer to those 
who urged him to take physic: ' Tarry till such time as 



I have recovered my health and strength again, that 
then I may the better be enabled to endure the violence 
and hazard of their potions.' " 

Mr. Wright's opinions of Pater's various 
works are briefly given, nor does he enter into 
any long analyses or descriptions of these works. 
It is the more homely and human, not the lit 
erary and artistic side of Pater, that he chooses 
chiefly to portray. In rating the Renaissance 
studies well above any of the other writings, 
even above " Marius," and in rather disparag- 
ing the " Plato and Platonism," which even 
Jowett felt moved to commend, he seems to be 
denying to some of Pater's best work the praise 
that is its due. But other critics, notably and 
most recently Mr. Benson, have written appre- 
ciatively and at length on these matters, although 
Mr. Benson's work shows signs of haste, of 
"too many irons in the fire." A revision of 
his book, now that greater industry has thrown 
new light on dark places, is to be desired, and 
indeed is urged by his friendly antagonist. 

But even Mr. Wright, with aU his diligence 
and the repeated revision of his manuscript, has 
not freed his work from every mark of haste or 
carelessness. He persists (if one may notice 
so small a matter) in using " previous " as an 
adverb ; he makes Oscar Wilde " a boy of 
seventeen " in 1874, having already (with Mr. 
Sherard) placed his birth in 1854 ; he misquotes 
Shakespeare so far as to write the un-Shake- 
spearean neuter possessive pronoun, and more 
than once speaks of " Love's Labour Lost"; 
he puts " peroration " in place of " exordium"; 
and he, or the printer, is guilty of " FeuiUet." 
With a reckless disregard of physical laws he 
describes the old town of Spires as lighted at 
night " by lamps suspended over chains stretched 
across the streets," — a rare illustration of 
Stockton's " negative gravity." 

Ninety-two (the title-page modestly says 
seventy-eight) plates, including several unfami- 
liar portraits of Pater and three of Mr. Richard 
C. Jackson, the original of " Marius," are 
scattered through the volumes ; and there are 
ten bibliographical and other "Appendices," 
besides an ample preface. The richness of 
illustrative and sometimes not too closely rele- 
vant matter more than once comes very near 
to being padding, — as in the author's closing 
sketches of his subordinate characters. The 
narrative, too, is chopped up into absurdly short 
chapters, forty-seven in number, for no other 
apparent purpose than to waste space ; the paper 
is thick ; and each inserted plate counts as two

pages in the pagination. The footnotes are 
superfluously and tiresomely numerous, includ- 
ing as they do explanations of the obvious, and 
not a few cross-references such as diligent edi- 
tors of ancient texts love to send scampering 
like so many little barking dogs across the 
bottom of their pages. But a life as devoid of 
outward incident as Pater's must needs be 
treated with all possible ingenuity on the part 
of author and publisher in order to swell it to 
the approved two-volume form. A less expen- 
sive thin-paper edition in one volume is what 
the lui wealthy book-buyer might reasonably de- 
mand ; for this excellent and perhaps " defini- 
tive," even if here and there distorted, presenta- 
tion of " the real Pater " is a book worth buying.

Justice to the Railroads.* 



The attention of the people of this nation has 
been concentrated for a year or more upon our 
railroads and their relation to public interests. 
The thought and purpose of the American 
people moves from one extreme to another, and 
this is as true in the field of railroad criticism 
as in any other. Fifty years ago every com- 
munity went out and met an intending railroad 
with a brass band, the freedom of the city, 
choice locations, right of way without compensa- 
tion, and, in a general way, a chromo thrown 
in. Within the last few years we have swung 
to the other extreme, and it has been difficijlt 
to find in the public mind any good thing that 
could be said of railroads. Their whole manage- 
ment has been bad, and nothing that might be 
done to restrain them would be considered in- 
appropriate. Even the Inter-State Commerce 
Commission has caught this public spirit at 
times, and has demanded powers that might 
not be wisely administered. The legislatures 
of the various states have been keen on the trail 
of the railroad, and within the last few months 
some fifteen legislatures have passed bills fixing 
a maximum rate of two cents a mile for pas- 
senger transportation. In consequence of all 
this panic, and all this grim determination to 
down the railroad, railroad men have been ask- 
ing themselves how they might best take stock 
of the future. Sensitive credit has felt the in- 
fluence, and loans that were easy to negotiate

for the purpose of railroad improvement a year 
or two ago are difficidt to make to-day. 

The looker-on in Vienna cannot help asking 
whether this is quite as it should be ; whether 
a great industry that has done so much to 
develop the resources of this nation, and to make 
the nation great, not only industrially but poli- 
tically, can be as bad as has been represented, 
or deserve punishments as dire as have been 
urged. At such a time any literature that will 
fairly present the history of the railroad in con- 
nection with the growth of this nation, and 
also describe the railroad in its construction 
and operation, cannot help but bring about a 
better condition of things, at least in public 
sentiment. Three years ago Professor Emery 
R. Johnson produced an admirable little treatise 
entitled " American Railroad Transportation," 
which for the first time put within the covers 
of one book an adequate account of the railroad 
system of the United States. Close on his heels 
came Mr. Pratt, the railway correspondent of the 
London "Times," who in his book on " Ameri- 
can Railways " gave the impartial view of an 
outsider. And now we have a work on "The 
Working of Railroads," by Mr. Logan G. 
McPherson, a very good supplement to the two 
previously mentioned, as in a most scientific 
and carefid manner it presents the various func- 
tions of railroading in their details and in their 
inter-relation as well as in their relations to the 
public and the state. 

In the first chapter of Mr. Logan's book, 
on "The Transportation Function,' he shows 
most vividly how localization of industry has 
been made possible in this country by the expan- 
sion of our railroad system, a localization which 
has been essential to the success of our indus- 
trial growth. In the next chapter he takes up 
" Construction and Operation." Under the 
latter term he discusses somewhat in detail the 
three great departments involved in maintenance 
of way, maintenance of equipment, and trans- 
portation. One cannot read further than 
through this chapter, however ignorant one may 
have been before, without beginning to grasp 
the tremendous forces that are involved in the 
building and equipping of a railroad. The third 
chapter is devoted to that subject around which 
the battle with the railroad has been waged 
during the last three years — that is, traffic. 
Under this subject the author discusses the car- 
riage of persons and the carriage of goods by 
express, by mail, or by the ordinary freight 
shipment. The complex subject of rates is 
presented somewhat at length, and the different

principles are brought out that are involved in 
the basing point as used in America, the taper- 
ing system as used in Australia, and the Zone 
System as used in Hungary. This chapter 
will be good i-eading for those who, following 
the magnetic lead of Mr. Stickney, have come 
to the conclusion that rate-making is an easy 
thing and that not much technical and expert 
knowledge is necessary for its performance. 

The more formal and technical portion of 
the raUroad business is discussed in a chapter 
on " Accounting and Statistics." Then in the 
fifth chapter the author rises into the larger 
field of strategy, in the discussion of " Financial 
and Executive Administration." The relation- 
ship of the railroad to those whose capital is 
used in the form of stocks or bonds, and on 
the other hand toward the financing agencies 
of Wall Street, is presented in a very business- 
like way. More than that, the financing of a 
railroad, not merely when it is in a prosperous 
condition, but in disastrous times when it passes 
into the hands of a receiver, is also discussed. 
Two very important chapters are on " Correla- 
tion " and " Integration." The first has to do 
with what might be called the oiling of the 
system, by means of which everything works 
harmoniously and without friction. The second 
is concerned with what is familiarly known in 
the industrial world as standardization. This 
is developed in the most interesting way with 
reference to construction and equipment, signal- 
ing, ticketing, and the carrying out of every 
form of business on a national system rather 
than a local and diverse one. The final chap- 
ter, on the " Relation to the Public and the 
State," is partly historical in its discussion 
of pooling and the Inter-State Commerce Com- 
mission, and partly critical in the suggestions 
which are brought out in connection with the 
Hepburn biU and other bills that resulted in 
the drastic legislation of 1906. The whole is 
presented in an unprejudiced and impartial 
way, and the book is the most important con- 
tribution to its branch of the subject that has 
yet been made. It would pay the railroads to 
buy a million copies of this book and place it 
in the hands of the public for educational pur- 
poses. If the whole industrial life of the nation, 
which is so inextricably interlaced with the rail- 
road system of the country, is not to be violently 
disturbed, it is very desirable that such know- 
ledge as this book contains be given to the man 
on the street in regard to the merits and demerits 

of the railroad problem, y t tt

The Story of L<a Sal,t.e's Last Voyage.* 

The present writer has had occasion to review, 
within the last few years, several reprints of 
important books of travel bearing on the early 
history of America, and is glad to avail himself 
of this additional opportunity for commending 
the enterprise and patriotism of American pub- 
lishers in this regard. As a Canadian, he can 
do this without any suggestion of national glori- 
fication. The voyages and travels of Marquette, 
Hennepin, La Salle, Lahontan, to mention no 
others, are of as much interest and value to 
Canadians as to Americans, and Canada has 
been laid under a debt of gratitude to American 
publishers for reprinting these rare volumes. 
Among them we now have a new edition of 
Joutel's famous Journal of La Salle's last voy- 
age, with valuable historical notes, etc., by Mr. 
Heniy Reed Stiles. 

Joutel, it will be remembered, accompanied 
La Salle on that memorable voyage of 1684, so 
promising in its opening and so disastrous in its 
end. He was a fellow-townsman of La Salle's, 
and seems to have accompanied the expedition 
at La Salle's personal request. His duties were 
to superintend all matters pertaining to the 
provisioning, sheltering, and general care and 
comfort of the settlers whom La Salle confidently 
expected to become the nucleus of a prosperous 
French colony in Louisiana. " His services to 
the enterprise," says Dr. Stiles in his Biograph- 
ical Note on Joutel, " as they are simply and 
circumstantially narrated in this Journal, and 
corroborated by contemporary evidence, prove 
that La Salle's choice of him as the ' man of 
affairs ' of the expedition was well-founded and 
fortunate. Practical, methodical, resourceful 
in every emergency, tactful in his dealings with 
all the members of the heterogeneous company 
with whom he was associated, and inflexibly 
loyal to his Chief, Joutel fuUy proved his worth." 
Charlevoix met Joutel in 1723, many years 
after his return from America, and speaks of 
him as a very upright man, and evidently the 
only trustworthy member of La Salle's party. 
Parkman, judging Joutel merely by the internal 
evidence of his Journal, reached an equally 
favorable conclusion as to his sense, intelligence, 
and candor. The evidence of such a man, as to 
the circumstances surrounding La Salle's voyage 
to the Gulf of Mexico, his heroic struggle against

appallingly adverse circumstances, and his death 
at the hands of his own men, is of the utmost 
worth. It is safe to say that of the several 
narratives of this expedition Joutel's is far and 
away the best, — in fact, the only trustworthy 
account we have of the voyage in its entirety. 

Joutel has been criticised for his alleged 
acquiescence in the murder of La SaUe, and for 
his subsequent connivance in the concealment 
of the fact of La Salle's death. On these points 
Dr. Stiles's opinion is interesting. He says : 

" No shadow of complicity in the murder of La Salle 
attaches to Joutel. That he did not more strongly 
assert himself in the critical emergencies which suc- 
ceeded that tragical event, was due, probably, to a 
combination of circumstances. The mutineers who had 
accomplished the deed were overwhelmingly dominant, 
and the lives of the whole party tremWed in the balance. 
Joutel was no coward; but the situation in which they ' 
found themselves called for the exercise of that pru- 
dence which is of ttimes the better part of valor. Neither 
was he ambitious ; so that when the little band of seven 
who sought to separate themselves from the assassins 
finally started upon their long and perilous journey 
toward the North, we find, as if by common consent, 
that the Abb^ Cavelier (La Salle's brother) figures as 
the nominal leader. Undoubtedly this was due partly 
to the respect felt by Joutel for the aged ecclesiastic 
by virtue of his sacred office, as well as by his own life- 
long association, at Rouen, with the family of Cavelier; 
and also by motives of policy in thus securing for the 
party the prestige of being headed by a La Salle — a 
' name to conjure with ' amid the savage tribes through 
whom they must pass." 

Thus far, most of us will probably be inclined 
to agree with Dr. Stiles in clearing Joutel's 
character from any serious fault ; but it is not 
so easy to acquiesce in his somewhat lukewarm 
defence of Joutel's connivance in the conceal- 
ment of the fact of La Salle's death. No doubt 
Dr. Stiles is quite right in saying that the de- 
ception originated with the Abbe Cavelier, " who 
desired thereby to get possession of property 
which might otherwise have been seized by 
creditors of his deceased brother . . . La Salle"; 
but as this is no defense of Cavalier's conduct, 
so is it no defense of Joutel's conduct to say 
that his connivance was due to respect for Cave- 
lier's cloth and family. The concealment was 
outrageous, and Joutel must in this respect 
share Cavelier's well-earned blame, whatever his 
motives may have been. Whatever punishment 
Cavelier deserved, he does not seem to have got 
it in this world, for, according to Parkman, he 
lived to a good old age, and died rich, " having 
inherited a large estate after his return from 
America " — La Salle's evidently. 

This edition of Joutel's Journal is so admir- 
able in most respects that it seems ungratefid 
to offer any criticism. At the same time it 



does appear somewhat regrettable that in select- 
ing the text for it the most complete one avail- 
able was not taken. The text adopted is that 
of the English translation (1714) of the Paris 
edition of 1713. We need not go further than 
Mr. Griffin's Bibliography (p. 230) to learn 
that this edition, " methodiz'd " by the Sieur 
de Mitchell, is but an abridged and modified 
version of the narrative, and that Joutel com- 
plained that changes had been made by the 
editor in retouching the work for publication. 
On the other hand, Margry in his " Decouver- 
tes et etablissements des Fran^ais," vol. iii., 
pp. 89-534, published the Journal in its entirety 
and integrity. A translation of the Margry 
copy would have had to be specially made, it is 
true, while the other was ready to hand; but 
how much more satisfactory it would have been 
to have had a translation of Joutel's Journal as 
he wrote it, rather than of a version that is, to 
say the least, open to suspicion ! 

Taking the text as it stands, one cannot too 
highly commend the present edition. Follow- 
ing the Historical Introduction, and the Biogra- 
phical Note on Joutel by Dr. Stiles, we have, 
first, the original title-page (of the London edi- 
tion, 1714) in facsimile ; then the French Book- 
seller to the Reader, and the Preface written by 
Sieur de Mitchell, as they appeared in the En- 
glish edition ; then the text of the Journal, 
with notes and annotations by Dr. Stiles ; fol- 
lowed by " Remainder of Letter by he who 
revis'd this Journal, being sequel to same," 
and Letters Patent granted by the King of 
France to M. Crozat. Finally, we have Mr. 
Griffin's very full Bibliography, and the Index. 
A heliotype reproduction of Gudebrod's statue 
of La Salle, made for the Louisiana Purchase 
Exposition, is used as a frontispiece ; and at the 
end of the volume will be found a reproduction 
in facsimile of Joutel's map originally published 
in the Paris edition of 1713. 

Mr. Griffin's Bibliography is by no means 
the least valuable portion of the book. It is, 
of course, much more than a bibliography of 
La Salle ; rather, in fact, a bibliography of the 
discovery and exploration of the Mississippi 
Valley. Prepared for another purpose, some 
little time ago, it only comes down to the year 
1882, and consequently omits a good deal of 
important material published since that time. 
For instance, one finds no mention of Winsor's 
" Narrative and Critical History of America " 
or of his " Cartier to Frontenac," both import- 
ant in their bearing on the discovery and ex- 
ploration of the Mississippi VaUey. Similarly,

we do not find Fiske's " Discovery of America," 
or Thwaitess monumental edition of " The 
Jesuit Relations," or his editions of Hennepin 
and Lahontan. Neither do we find Bandeliers 
" The Gilded Man," in which new light is 
thrown on La Salle's last voyage, and on his 
death ; nor Girouard's " Lake St. Louis," which 
bears on an earlier period of La Salle's life. No 
mention is made of the quite considerable liter- 
ature that has grown up about the voyages of 
Radisson and Chouart, especially the third voy- 
age. On this voyage, according to one group 
of historians, they reached the Mississippi — 
first of white men ; according to another group, 
they did nothing of the kind. Whether they 
did or not, the controversy is too important to 
be omitted from a Bibliography of the Discovery 
and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley. It 
included papers in the Transactions of the Royal 
Society of Canada, by Benjamin Suite, Judge 
Prud'homme, and Dr. N. E. Dionne, and in 
the publications of the Minnesota and Wisconsin 
Historical Societies, by Judge Brower, Henry 
Colin Campbell, Warren Upham, and others ; 
and of course it includes the Voyages themselves, 
published in 1885 by the Prince Society. One 
notes, too, in the section of the Bibliography 
dealing with maps, the omission of any reference 
to the valuable Notes on Maps, etc., pp. 153- 
192, in the " Book of Arbitration Documents " 
published by the Government of Ontario in 
1884 ; or to S. J. Dawson's Memorandum on 
early maps, pp. 325-330 of the same book. 

These omissions are noted, not in any spirit 
of criticism of Mr. Griffin's Bibliography, but 
to illustrate the importance, perhaps in some 
future edition, of having it brought down to the 
present year. Lawrence J. Burpee. 



International, IjAw in the Russo- 
Japanese War.* 



The late war between Russia and Japan 
brought out a crop of books, some in French 
others in English, dealing with the various 
questions of international law raised during 
this conflict. Some of the controversies thus 
raised, such for example as those relating to the 
use of wireless telegraphy and the employment 
of floating mines, were both new and unique. 
New applications were also given of old and 
well established principles of international law,

Japanese War. By Amos S. Hershey. New York: The Mac- 
millan Co. 



and new precedents established which will 
doubtless afPect the future conduct of war. The 
most scholarly, exhaustive, and illuminating 
study of the Kusso- Japanese conflict from the 
standpoint of international law and diplomacy 
has been made by Professor Hershey of the 
University of Indiana. It makes a fitting sup- 
plement to Dr. Asakawa's excellent work en- 
titled " The Russo-Japanese Conflict," which 
appeared a year or two ago, and which, like the 
present work, is indispensable to the student of 
Russo-Japanese relations prior to the treaty of 
Portsmouth. A portion of the ground covered 
by Professor Hershey had already been occupied 
by Professor T. J. Lawrence of Cambridge in 
his " War and Neutrality in the East," pub- 
lished in the summer of 1904, a few months 
after the outbreak of hostilities. Professor 
Lawrence's book, owing to its early publication, 
necessarily left luitouched some of the import- 
ant questions which were raised during the 
latter months of the war and, besides, the con- 
troversies with which it deals are treated with 
less thoroughness by Professor Lawrence than 
by Dr. Hershey. A bulky volume by two 
English barristers. Smith and Sibley, published 
a year ago, undertook to cover the entire field, 
but it is full of gross inaccuracies, and is over- 
laden with extraneous matter. 

After a sixty-page review of the causes of 
the ^(var, based largely but by no means entirely 
upon Dr. Asakawa's work. Professor Hershey 
reviews the steps leading up to the outbreak of 
hostilities and examines the Russsian charge of 
Japanese treachery in beginning hostilities in 
advance of a formal declaration of war. Pro- 
fessor Hershey's conclusion on this point is that 
to which every impartial student must come — 
namely, that Japan's action was neither unpre- 
cedented nor contrary to strict international 
ethics (p. 67). With regard to Japanese vio- 
lation of Korean neutrality, however, he finds 
Japan guilty of a violation of one of the most 
fundamental rules of international law, — the 
right of every independent state to remain neu- 
tral during war among other nations and to have 
its neutrality respected by all belligerents (p. 71). 
With regard to the treatment of enemy sub- 
jects in each others territory at the outbreak of 
hostilities, he thinks the conduct of both bellig- 
erents, although not strictly illegal, was far from 
being liberal, particularly when compared with 
the liberal policy of the United States govern- 
ment during the Spanish- American War as that 
policy was embodied in the proclamations of 
President McKinley and in the decisions of the

Supreme Court (pp. 295-7). The Japanese 
were repeatedly accused of disregarding the 
obligations of the Hague and Geneva Conven- 
tions by firing upon Red Cross trains and 
hospital ships, while the Russians in turn were 
accused of withholding from the Japanese in- 
formation concerning Japanese prisoners, and 
of using " dumdum " bullets in several engage- 
ments. Each accused the other of bombarding 
undefended coast towns (p. 311), and of neglect- 
ing sick and wounded soldiers held as captives, 
but the evidence available is not sufficient to 
convict either of flagrant abuses under any of 
these counts. Mr. Hershey's conclusion is that 
while there were a number of alleged violations 
of the rules of civilized warfare, especially on 
the part of Russia, these rules were on the whole 
fairly well observed by both belligerents. The 
violations proved were few and unimportant, 
considering the magnitude of the military opera- 
tions. In this respect Dr. Hershey says the 
Russo-Japanese War ranks as high perhaps as 
any in history, with the possible exception of 
the Spanish-American conflict (p. 323). Aside 
from Japan's violation of Korean neutrality and 
the cutting out of the " Ryeshetelni " from the 
harbor of Chefoo, she showed remarkable con- 
sideration for the rights of neutrals. Russia, 
on the other hand, was guilty of repeated and 
flagrant violations of neutral rights. The 
seizures by the volunteer cruisers, the " Peter- 
burg' and the " Smolensk," the detention of 
the German mail steamer "Prinz Heinrich," 
the arrest of the P. and O. liner " Malacca," 
the sinking of the " Thea " and the " Knight 
Commander," and the unwarranted extension 
of the doctrine of contraband were some of the 
more important instances of infringements upon 
neutral rights. The inclusion of coal, naphtha, 
cotton, and food stuffs in the list of vmcondi- 
tional contraband, and the adoption of the rule 
that the destination instead of the use to which 
such articles were to be put determined their 
liability to capture, were not only contrary to 
the most enlightened rules of modern warfare 
but, so far as coal was concerned, were contrary 
to Russian practice. The Russian rule made 
no distinction, for example, between a cargo of 
anthracite destined for Nagasaki (the seat of 
the Japanese Navy Yard) and a cargo of soft 
coal destined for the cotton factories of Osaka. 
If destined for a belligerent port they were liable 
to capture irrespective of whether the intended 
use were innocent or hostile. This rule was 
utterly at variance with that embodied in the 
American order of Jime 20, 1898, which treated 



coal as contraband only when destined to a naval 
station, a port of call, or a ship of the enemy, 
and also with the provisions of the U. S. naval 
code which treated the other articles mentioned 
as contraband only when intended for the use 
of the military or naval forces of the enemy. 
The Russian decrees with regard to contraband 
called out vigorous protests from the Amer- 
ican and English governments, and Russia was 
finally forced to modify the objectionable rule 
until it conformed more nearly to the American 
doctrine. 

One of the new and unprecedented questions 
of international law raised during the Russo- 
Japanese War related to the rights of war cor- 
respondents and the use of wireless telegraphy 
in neutral waters and on the high seas. The 
controversy was raised by a Russian decree an- 
nouncing the intention of the Russian govern- 
ment of treating as spies newspaper correspond- 
ents who were found making use of wireless 
telegraph apparatus within the zone of military 
operations, and as lawful prize any vessel pro- 
vided with such apparatus. It was well known 
that the order was directed against the corre- 
spondent of the London " Times," who was then 
cruising in the Yellow Sea on a dispatch boat 
equipped with a De Forest wireless telegraph 
outfit. The present rules of warfare contain 
no provision covering such cases, and the mat- 
ter should and probably will receive the atten- 
tion of the forthcoming Hague Conference. A 
somewhat similar question was raised by the 
action of the Russians in installing a wireless 
telegraph instrument in the neutral port of 
Chefoo for the transmission of messages from 
Port Arthur during the investment of that 
place by the Japanese. Upon representation 
the Chinese authorities, realizing their neutral 
obligations, demolished the wireless station in 
August, 1904. Another new question was 
raised by the alleged conduct of the Russians 
in sowing the strait of Pechili with submarine 
mines which floated into the open seas, con* 
stituting grave danger to neutral shipping. 
There seems to have been some doubt whether 
such a proceeding was the result of deliberate 
action on the part of the Russians or merely the 
result of carelessness, but in either case the Rus- 
sian authorities were guilty of a gross violation 
of the rules of civilized warfare. The Institute 
of International Law, at its last session (Sep- 
tember, 1906), adopted a series of resolutions 
relative to wireless telegraphy and submarine 
mines in war, and the coming Hague Conference 
will doubtless take some action on the subject.

Other phases of the war interestingly treated 
by Professor Hershey are "The North Sea 
Incident " which was terminated happily through 
the employment of an International Commission 
of Inquiry in accordance with the provisions of 
one of the Hague Conventions ; " The Hay 
Note and Chinese Neutrality"; "Belligerent 
Warships in Neutral Ports"'; the rules of war- 
fare adopted by both belligerents ; and " The 
Relations of England and the United States 
during the War." In a chapter entitled " The 
Conduct of the United States " the author shows 
that the conduct of our government as well as 
the people was "remarkably clear and consistent" 
in the performance of their neutral duties toward 
both beUigerents. j. w. Garner. 



Signs of Social, Unrest.* 

Professor Goldwin Smith has published his opin- 
ions on the labor question in a sensible " letter to a 
labour friend," in which he urges a policy at once 
conservative and progressive. His argument for 
positions taken is rather an appeal to familiar facts 
than an induction from fresh investigations. The 
interest of the letter lies in its formulation of the 
judgment of a historical student who is familiar 
with many aspects of life and is reasonably free 
from bias. 

The preface to " In the Fire of the Heart " fore- 
warns the critic of the dire consequences of an 
unfavorable review. This creates an unnecessary 
prejudice against a well-meaning effort to outline a 
social policy which is a kind of tamed socialism. 
Having ticketed the volume we know what we may 
in general expect : municipal management of public 
utilities, initiative, referendum, and recall, opportu- 
nities, of culture for the people. Articles in mag- 
azines and newspapers have made these ideas 
common property and they have been treated with 
greater care and accuracy in numerous treatises. 
The simple reassertion of opinions is not proof of 
their soundness, and the reader can easily discover 
that the arguments on one side are here urged with- 
out much consideration of those on the other side. 
With the ethical ideals of the author it would be 
difficult to take issue.

ume, "The Batdes of Labor," is warlike, but the

plea is pacific. With good sense, wide learning, and 
ripe experience the eminent statistician opens to 
young theologians that world of conflict in which 
ethical and religious principles are put to severest 
strain. Most of the lectures are historical in char- 
acter, and it is by this road that men are induced to 
come into the best temper for considering problems 
where " self the wavering balance shakes." It is a 
little provoking, however, to break off conversation 
after a few paragraphs on so profound a theme, 
when we know the reserves of knowledge are so 
vast, and where it is impossible to present all sides 
in the compass of a popular lecture. Nevertheless 
the earnest students must have gained a clearer view 
and a saner judgment from listening to our veteran 
master in the economic field. 

A man may be guiltless of the tobacco habit and 
yet ai'ouse the suspicions of his wife after an even- 
ing at the club has filled hair, beard, and clothing 
with the odor of stale smoke. Even so companion- 
ship with criminals and vagabonds, as well as with 
radical rebels against traditional order, must at last 
give a certain flavor to thought and expression. 
Mr. Hapgood has made familiar and sympathetic 
acquaintance with thieves in his "Autobiography of 
a Thief " and has introduced us to a rude labor 
leader in Anton, the hero of "The Spirit of Labor." 
The first impression is disagreeable and even repul- 
sive, when we are carried bodily into the society of 
organized labor as depicted in these strong chapters. 
Centuries of neglect on the part of the privileged, 
decades of recent antagonisms, crowded dwellings 
and shops training multitudes to communistic ideals, 
bear fruit in revenge, revolt, and clash with the con- 
ventionalities of the world of business managers, 
including their churches. A few generations of 
common schools, with compidsory education and 
child labor laws, and the leaders of workingmen 
will not resemble Anton in vulgar and ungrammat- 
ical language, though they may not be so pictur- 
esque as he. That the trade union movement can 
use such a man is obvious enough, but he is hardly 
a typical character. Only the life of a tramp and 
of early hardship, with bigoted teachers, could pro- 
duce just such a spu-it, and the wonder is that it 
retains so much that is sound and fair. It is not 
quite safe for comfortable people to be ignorant of 
the way in which some hundreds of thousands of 
discontented neighbors look at life. We should 
know their reasons for revolt, even if they are un- 
reasonable, for suspicion and prejudice are social 
facts and usually have some ground in experience. 
The Pharisee who bragged in the temple and scorned 
sinners is not a model for men who desire to con- 
front reality. The story of Anton and his social- 
istic, anarchistic, and trade union comrades is a 
faithful and photographic picture of aspects of the 
urban activity of vast multitudes of industrials com- 
bining to assist each one his fellow in the struggle 
for existence and fulness of life. The forces revealed 
are full of danger, the temper is ugly, the manners 
not always urbane, the judgment not always well

informed, the range of knowledge often limited; 
but there is wondrous power, vigor, and the chaotic 
promise of a better and larger morality than any- 
thing the churches yet have taught, or the mere book 
students have ever dreamed. Miss Jane Addams 
has discovered this larger morality in seeming 
coarseness and evil, and Mr. Hapgood has given us 
glimpses of it in the biography of his man of toil 
and rebellion. The Philistine needs the Anarchist 
to wake him, as Hume did Kant, from his dogmatic 
slumbers, and the Philistine may (let us hope 
rarely) wear cap and gown. 

. " This book is an attempt," says the preface to 
" The Labour Movement in Australasia," " to de- 
scribe the history of the political labour party of 
Australasia. I have tried to write from the stand- 
point of an agnostic in social creeds." Certainly 
the facts are set down with candor and impartiality. 
Some very excellent and inspiring writers have gone 
to the British colonies of the South Pacific for 
proofs of their radical theories, and the reader is 
always a little uncertain whether the very moral 
earnestness of the advocates of progress does not 
obscure their vision of reality. Even in counting 
stars or blood corpuscles the scientific observer must 
beware of having theoretic expectations, and the 
personal equation must always be checked by the 
sober look of those who have no hypothesis to prove. 
In the book before us the observations seem to be 
set down with singular fidelity to plain truth and to 
deserve confidence. Australasia is an interesting 
world and a large world. Its people and institu- 
tions have attracted the attention of social students 
because certain novel experiments have been tried 
with socialistic ideas. The minimum wage doctrine 
has there found embodiment in law ; industrial arbi- 
tration has passed from discussion into action ; the 
government has gone into business like any ordinary 
corporation. All these radical measures have grown 
naturally out of the situation, but it is too early to 
sing the praises of a fighter whUe he is still in the 
throes of struggle with a powerful adversary, and 
equally premature now to foretell the triumph of 
government ownership in far-away Australasia. 
That the country has been prosperous no one can 
deny, but that may be from the natural advantages 
of the land and people and not from government 
interference in industry and commerce. That the 
labor party has made serious mistakes seems quite 
obvious ; but our business corporations have not 
always been successful, and many of the great man- 
agers have proved costly servants of the confiding 
stockholders and general public. It is refreshing to 
find an author who is willing to let the facts speak 
for themselves without playing tricks on credulous 
partisans and furnishing food to prejudice ; and in 
this interesting volume the author seems to be hon- 
estly trying to place the reader in position to form 
his own judgment in presence of the actual situation 
without too much prompting as to the conclusions 
he ought to derive from the survey. 

The time is not yet ripe to speak the last word 



on the minimum wage, and very able representative 
economists think it will be impossible to fix a stand- 
ard below which wages shall not go. But the hour 
has come for an earnest and careful consideration 
of the central ethical problem of economic life : viz., 
is a standard of community obligation discoverable, 
or must the wages of the unskilled workmen con- 
tinue to be determined by the battle of competing 
forces ? It is obvious that if we question the morality 
of the rate fixed by competition we must find another 
method of measuring social duty. In Mr. Ryan's 
" A Living Wage " these questions are clearly and 
cogently discussed. The ecclesiastical bias is frankly 
revealed, but it does not seem to affect the value of 
the reasoning process, and nothing rests merely on 
church authority. The starting point is the assertion 
that every man has a right to live a decent human 
life by the product of his labor, and that those who 
control the materials and the instruments of pro- 
duction are the persons primarily responsible for 
paying a living wage. Since the entire community 
ultimately shares this responsibility, the employer 
should be compelled by law to pay a living wage, and 
pensions should secure a suitable income for old age 
when earning power ceases. If the fundamental 
principle is accepted and proves to be practically 
enforceable then society has a measure of the mini- 
mum duty of the employer and of the state ; and 
this measure defines the beginning of poor relief as 
well as of wages, insurance, and pensions. This 
doctrine is so at war with our individualistic modes 
of thought and the traditions of legislation and judi- 
cial decisions that its advocates must not hope for 
its speedy and easy reception. The writer of this 
book has brought together in clear and readable 
form most of the essential arguments which have 
been offered for his contention ; and he has supplied 
to trade unions and advocates of advanced social 
legislation very telling arguments for their position. 
It is difficult to see how any honest man who has 
hitherto been comfortable in conscience in the pay- 
ment of starvation wages, on the ground that a com- 
petitive or customary rate is also a just rate, can 
retain his self-satisfaction and complacency after 
reading this argument. Perhaps the best way to 
peace of mind is not to read such books at all, and 
that is the path frequently followed.

house table, or in the cosy inn-parlor. More than 
once his enthusiasm moves him to eloquence, the 
eloquence of terse and apt phraseology. Discoursing 
of toast, he denounces stale toast as an abomination, 
for " it is limp and tough and indigent. Moreover, 
the mastication of it makes no sound. Now the 
noise from good toast should reverberate in the head 
like the thunder of July." In a chapter " Concern- 
ing Breakfast " we read : " If the hoardings are to 
be believed, the form of porridge now most in vogue 
is of Quaker origin. Quaker oats, one supposes, 
shoidd be the very antithesis of wild oats. Porridge 
— homely, honest fare though it be — is the cause 
of more strife than any other dish. The great salt- 
versus-sugar battle is eternally waged above it ; for 
some take salt and some sugar, and they that take 
salt are the scorn of those that take sugar, and they 
that take sugar are despised of those that take salt. 
Quakers being a pacific folk, their oats should have 
stopped this warfare." Admirable for its deftness 
of whimsical and yet appropriate characterization is 
the little chapter on the days of the week. This 
from an essay on letter-writing may be of interest : 
" Yet although spelling is now fixed [which one is 
glad to learn], pronunciation is not, and what we 
lose of individuality in writing we can gain in talk. 
I sometimes wish that pronunciation were fixed, for 
it is very embarrassing to be conversing with some- 
one who has a totally different way from one's own 
of applying stress ; and this difficulty has grown 
since London became a suburb of New York." The 
essays are reprints, sometimes elaborated ; but they 
were all worth collecting. 

A sketch ^^ many people the political and 

of social life constitutional history of England is 
in England. (jj.y ^nd unattractive. The historian 

Green was perhaps the first to consider the social 
side of English history important enough to write 
about, and his history is still the best all-around 
account. However, to meet popular demand, short 
histories of social conditions alone have from time 
to time appeared. One of the latest and best of 
these is M. B. Synge's " A Short 'History of 
Social Life in England" (A. S. Barnes «& Co). In 
twenty-eight short chapters, covering about four 
hundred pages, the author gives us a narrative of 
much interest and considerable value. It is, as the 
author states, " a book of detail," about the life of 
English men, women, and children, — their homes, 
their dress, manners, and etiquette, their religious 
and superstitious customs, their food, their health, 
their occupations, crimes and punishment, and many 
other such matters. The arrangement is somewhat 
peculiar ; no topic is treated fully in one place, but 
the chapters correspond to the generally accepted 
divisions of political history, and for each of these 
periods the author gives an account of the more 
important social forces. This method, while not 
allowing unity of treatment, makes the book useful 
to read in connection with a purely political account. 



There are no references to authorities, no bibliog- 
raphies, and no footnotes ; for all of these omis- 
sions the average reader will be thankful and the 
student regretful. The author treats the entire 
subject as one of development, advance, and better- 
ment, and does it very successfully. The work is 
evidently based on wide reading and research. A 
feature is the frequent quotation from original 
sources of apt anecdotes, appropriate incidents, etc. 
One quotation, from an old book on etiquette, advises 
that " if you eat with another, turn over the nicest 
pieces to him," and never touch more than three 
fingers to the meat; another, from a physician's 
handbook, advises young doctors to " tell the patient 
you will by God's help cure him, but inform his 
friends that the case is a serious one . . . suppose 
you know nothing, say there is an obstruction of the 
liver . . . especially use the word 'obstruction' for 
patients do not understand it, which is important "; 
from a similar book is quoted a prescription for that 
complaint now known as " spring fever": " Shave the 
patient's head and anoint it with honey ; the flies 
will so worry him that he will continually strike 
out at them, which will cure his lethargy." Each 
chapter has much of such matter well incorporated 
into the text. For the 407 pages there is an index 
containing 74 entries; it is little less than insulting 
to the reader to put such an index in a book of 
this sort. 

For readers ^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^ author succeeds 

in France in writing a book which is full of 

and America. interest for the readers of the two 
great Republics of the world. This feat has been 
accomplished by Abb^ Felix Klein, Professor at 
the Catholic Institute of Paris, already favorably 
known to American readers through his book on 
" The Land of the Strenuous Life," published last 
year. Professor Klein has had the ingenious idea 
of writing a book in the character of a young Amer- 
ican student who is making his first visit to France. 
(La D^courverte du Vieux Monde, par un Etudiant 
de Chicago.) From this vantage-point he is able to 
describe attractive regions of that country, and to 
discuss entertainingly some of the great problems 
now confronting the French nation without shocking 
the patriotic pride and sensitiveness of his com- 
patriots. As Professor Klein has proved himself a 
sympathetic and careful observer, both at home 
and in this country, he has been able, while doing 
full justice to the many admirable sides of modern 
French civilization, to point out numerous incon- 
sistencies and absurdities in contemporary social and 
political organization. But whether he takes us to 
Paris or to Rouen, to Auvergne or to Le Quercy, his 
method is the same. By vivid and often charming 
descriptions, he acquaints us with the physical nature 
of the region ; while by making his various charac- 
ters express their opinions, or by his own reflections, 
he eloquently discusses the problems of the day.

ability, deplored as a serious menace by contem- 
porary writers, is illustrated by Bernard de Pujol, 
while Abb^ Lagrange represents the broad-minded 
and thoughtful members of the French clergy. Of 
course the book has a special interest for readers 
who have lived in France, who have been impressed 
by certain sides of French life, and who are familiar 
with the various leaders of French thought, some 
of whom express their views in the book under an 
assumed name. Even where we cannot agree with 
the author's conclusions — for example, in regard 
to the Protestant Church — we must admire and 
endorse his usually sane and fair attitude toward the 
problems he treats. 

The career of Auguste Rodin is an ex- 
iTnu^oT emplification of Victor Hugo's words : 

" Ami, cache ta vie et rdpands tes 
OBUvres." If few biographers have had as simple 
materials at their command as were within reach of 
Mr. Frederick Lawton while he was preparing his 
"Life and Work of Auguste Rodin" (Scribner), 
stUl fewer have understood as well as he the art of 
extracting from such materials as they possessed 
every item of information that would serve more 
fully to illustrate the genius and the career of the 
person they commemorated, or to display more 
clearly the blended or conflicting lights arid shades 
of his character. Unlike most noted persons, the 
sculptor's record is not " buried under a mountain 
of heterogeneous record "; his life has been modest, 
simple, and retired. Rodin occupies a unique posi- 
tion among the sculptors of his time. His present 
biographer, without attempting to establish any 
exact and definite precedence for his achievement 
over that of all others, asserts that his name will 
rank in the f utiire among the foremost of the great 
masters of the statuary art. England, quick to rec- 
ognize eminence in foreigners, has honored Rodin 
with the Presidency of the International Society of 
Sculptors, Painters, and Gravers, succeeding Whist- 
ler. Rodin was born in Paris on the 12th of 
November, 1840, and showed early ability as an 
artist. From this early talent sprang a style aimed 
at most of his brethren, and the hostility of 
sculptors of the orthodox school has been through- 
out, and is still, only too patent. If Rodin's posi- 
tion during the past few years, as Vice-President of 
the " Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts," has en- 
abled him to give more weighty utterance to his own 
convictions, these are none the less considered by 
the majority of French sculptors as rank heterodoxy. 
" They will not understand my realism," says Rodin. 
" For them sculpture should not endeavor to rep- 
resent flesh and blood and bone, since marble and 
bronze do not possess the colours which in painting 
create the illusion of life. I, on the contrary, claim 
that the sculptor can reach the same result if he will 
reproduce with fidelity and intensity the model he 
has before him. It is with his eyes fixed on life 
that he must work ; and his art will be able to rep- 
resent it entire, when he has observed sufficiently 



and has sufficiently trained his fingers." Mr. Law- 
ton's well-illustrated volume is a work of close and 
cogent reasoning, eminently fair and candid, and 
must promote a better understanding of the relative 
positions of representatives of the plastic art on 
questions which seem to involve serious but not 
necessarily irreconcilable antagonism. 

In President Hadley's " Baccalau- 
Xlrfutni" ^«^^« Addresses, and Other Talks ou 

Kindred Themes" (Scribner) there 
is a tone of fellowship and sympathy, a recognition 
of the common collegiate and human tie uniting him 
with his hearers, that must have made these short 
and unstudied discourses appeal with force to the 
audience addressed. That they did so appeal is 
partly proved by the request that they should be 
gathered together in book form for permanent pre- 
servation. They dwell, very properly and naturally, 
on the grand fundamentals of character and citizen- 
ship, of individual and social virtue, and, in the large 
wholesome sense, of piety and religion. That the 
latter can be taught as a thing apart is of course 
emphatically denied. " I believe," says the author, 
" that both in school life and in after life the moral 
training and the secular training must be so inter- 
woven that each becomes a part of the other." A 
return to something like the old system of a reg^ar 
college curriculum is favored. " Our college grad- 
uates of recent years," we read, " find that indis- 
criminate election of studies has meant intellectual 
dissipation. In short, we have learned that the 
sugar-plums of education do not furnish a strength- 
ening intellectual diet." The greater importance of 
being than doing, of character than visible perform- 
ance, is emphasized ; and there is good augury in 
the writer's assurance that " our country still aspires 
to be led by men who shall prove their claim for 
leadership, not by concrete material achievements, 
but by their character and their ideals." The simple, 
straightforward style of these addresses is engaging, 
even to the reader in his closet; to the hearers of 
the spoken word it must have been much more so. 
A slight error (of the types, probably) gives us " Ex- 
cept the Lord keep the house," etc.; and another 
inaccuracy, less chargeable to the long-snff ering com- 
positor, is the assigning of Mr. Kipling's " Reces- 
sional" to the Queen's fiftieth-anniversary celebra- 
tion, instead of to her Jubilee. 

„ . . ., In the second volume of his " Docu- 

inside views of mentary History of Reconstruction " 
Reconstruction. (Arthur H. Clark Co.), the first vol- 
ume of which was reviewed in these columns Jan. 1, 
1907, Professor Fleming gives ample material to 
illuminate actual conditions under the Reconstruction 
governments, with special reference to race relations, 
political morality, and economic, educational, and 
religious matters during the carpet-bag regime, and 
the final undoing of Reconstruction. The political 
rascality of the carpet-bag governments is the feature 
usually most emphasized by historians. To this

Professor Fleming devotes about 130 out of 455 
pages. The chapter on Educational Problems leaves 
the impression that the carpet-baggers deserve less 
credit for the public schools than some have been 
disposed to give them. Even these were used for 
peculation, as the report of the superintendent of 
education in Louisiana in ] 871 will show. How they 
were used to influence political action is revealed in 
the catechism which followed the arithmetic lesson 
in some of the Florida schools, the whole object of 
which was to inculcate loyalty to the Republican 
party and inspire hatred of Democrats. The church, 
which plays so important a part in the social life of 
the South, receives due attention in this volume. 
The chapter on Social and Industrial Conditions 
throws much light on the relation of the races, the 
real condition of the negro, and the difficulties of 
industrial reorganization. Each chapter is preceded 
by explanatory notes by the editor. To anyone who 
wishes to make a thorough study of Reconstruction, 
these volumes wUl be invaluable. They siipply most 
of the essentials of McPherson's work, and also a 
great deal of matter not found there at all. With 
three volumes to his credit. Professor Fleming now 
takes rank as one of the leading historians of Re- 
construction. The South is to be congratulated that 
one of her sons is able and willing to devote his time 
and talents to so important a work. 

The modern doctrine of the intimacy 
of connection between mental func- 
tion and bodily condition carries 
with it a vast system of practical consequences. 
Hygienic measures and warnings have taken place 
side by side with moral exhortations, or have re- 
placed them. A convenient and sensible handbook, 
setting forth the doctrines of sound health of mind, 
is furnished by Dr. T. S. Clouston in his volume 
entitled " The Hygiene of Mind " ( Dutton) . The 
nature of brain action, its dependence upon the 
muscular, nutritive, and supporting systems, the 
changes of state in the several ages of man, the 
momentous doctrines of heredity, the special liabili- 
ties of the periods of life, the questions of diet and 
exercise, the reflex influences of good cheer and 
healthy-mindedness — all these[are plainly handled, 
with no very g^reat brilliancy of illustration or 
novelty of insight, yet effectively and intelligibly. 
The book is a readable and practical contribution 
to its topic. It reflects a clinical interest in the 
workings of mind, but lacks the insight into the 
underlying psychological relations that might well 
sharpen the contours and add interest to the details 

of the ensemble. 

It is in a fine spirit of reverence for 
t/the'soum^ the traditions of her home-land that 
Mrs. St. Julien Ravenel has written 
the volume entitled "Charleston: The Place and 
the People " (Macmillan). While she modestly dis- 
claims all pretense to have written a history of the 
place she loves so dearly, Mrs. Ravenel has omitted 
few of the incidents, — tragic, romantic, prosaic, 



selfish, — which have taken place at Charleston 
during the two hundred and fifty years that the city 
has sat on her low shores and listened to her rivers 
flowing into the ocean. The scene has varied less 
than the actors, who are many — Indians, English- 
men, Huguenots, Covenanters, pirates, priests, pre- 
lates. Nonconformists, soldiers, Tories, Federalists, 
NuUificationists, Unionists, Secessionists. Of all 
these Mrs. Ravenel tells, — but above all of a society 
whose like the world will not see again, since all 
that produced it has gone forever. The charm 
of a past so eventful broods over the city in a re- 
markable degree, and the wistfulness of a love that 
looks back to a day that is dead touches the pages 
with a grace very much at one with the theme. In 
spite of Mrs. Ravenel's disclaimer, she has written 
a real history, and our only regret is that the very 
noble restraint with which she speaks of the sorrow- 
ful days of the war between the states has prevented 
her from telling many things which we are sure she 
knows and which we should greatly like to know 
also. The illustrations in the volume are in unusual 
harmony with the text, and are full of distinction 
and of charm, 

Justice and ^^ ^ ^^ok entitled " The Prisoner at 

injustice'.in the Bar" (Scribner), Mr. Arthur 

couru of law. Train, Assistant District Attorney in 
New York, has made some extremely interesting 
observations about the administration of criminal 
justice. The object of his book, he tells us, is to 
correct a general erroneous impression as to certain 
phases of criminal justice, and to give a concrete 
idea of its actual workings in large cities. He takes 
up these phases in successive chapters devoted to the 
subjects of crime and criminal procedure. The work, 
in no sense technical, gives a clear notion of the func- 
tion of lawyer, judge, juror, and witness, and lays 
bare the evils of the. law's delays, its "red-tape" 
and its " tricks." The present method of procedure, 
Mr. Train considers in many respects archaic; but 
he does not discuss the subject of criminal-law re- 
form. He states, however, that the present con- 
ditions are due to "our exaggerated regard for 
persoiial liberty coupled with a wholesale adoption 
of the technicalities of English law " which we have 
now outgrown. The author deplores the lack of 
respect for the law characteristic of the American 
people as a whole. Although thoroughly serious in 
purpose, he lightens his chapters with amusing anec- 
dote, and thus gives us an entertaining as well as 
a strikingly suggestive book. 

Guide-posts Professor Breasted's four volumes 
to the lore of of " Ancient Records " (University of

material classified chronologically. But that classi- 
fication alone is the smallest part of the value of 
the series. The documents entire are now thor- 
oughly indexed under eleven groups or themes that 
practically analyze their contents. These themes 
are comprehensive enough to satisfy the most fastid- 
ious antiquarian. They embrace ten pages on the

divine names of the ancient Egyptians, as many 
more on the temples of Egypt, and a full twelve- 
page list of old Egypt's kings. Persons, titles, 
offices, and ranks cover more than thirty-five pages. 
The geography index is a splendid illustration of 
the illuminating character of these old records. 
More than thirty pages reveal the completeness of 
the information that helps us identify so many of 
these important ancient sites. An admirable general 
or miscellaneous index is almost an analysis of some 
of those old texts. Egyptian, Hebrew, and Arabic 
indexes are purely for the scholar, and are useful 
chiefly in locating the use of these tongues in the 
popular translations. The student of Egyptian can 
find where the inscriptions of the great work of 
Lepsius are classified in the make-up of the " Ancient 
Records." Now we have a great work ready at 
hand with one of the best indexes ever constructed, 
making every fact available by its comprehensive 
system for quick and easy reference.

native legends compiled by Mr. Thomas G. Thrum, 
under the title of " Hawaiian Folk Tales " ( McClurg ) . 
The editor remarks that it is becoming more and 
more a matter of regret that a larger amount of 
systematic effort was not expended in early years 
in gathering and preserving the folk-lore of the 
Hawaiians, wherein is buried so much of the history 
of this people. The early attempts of Dibble and 
Pogue to gather material from the Hawaiians have 
preserved much that would otherwise have been 
lost ; and no one of late years had a better opportu- 
nity than King Kalakaua to collect the meles, kaaoa, 
and traditions of his race. Mr. Thrum points out 
that Judge Fornander's manuscript collection of 
meles, legends, and genealogies, in the vernacular, 
has fortunately become, by purchase, the property 
of the Hon. C. R. Bishop, which insures for poster- 
ity the result of one devoted scholar's efforts to 
rescue the ancient traditions that are gi-adually slip- 
ping away. The myths and legends of this tiny 
kingdom under tropical skies have a value not only 
for the historian of the islands, but for the student 
of folk-lore as well, suggesting the credibility of 
miracles, the spiritual significance pf trivial events, 
and many other interesting things. 



Notes. 



Dr. Eugene E. Agger is the author of a monograph 
on " The Budget in the American Commouwealths," 
which is published for Columbia University by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish in a single volume 
the two latest plays of M. Maeterlinck. The " Joyzelle " 
is translated by Mr. A. Texeira de Mattos, and the 
" Mouna Vanna " by Mr. Alfred Sutro. 



Among the books which Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons have in train for Spring publication is Albert Von 
Ruville's "William Pitt: Earl of Chatham." The 
work will appear in three volumes, and wUl be illus- 
trated. 

A volume of " Lettres Choisies des Madame de 
S^vign^," edited by M. Charles Boreux, and the two 
great comedies of Beaumarchais, edited by M. Jules 
Claretie, are the latest additions to the " Classiques 
Frangaise," published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 
" As You Like It " and " The Merchant of Venice " 
are two volumes of " The New Hudson Shakespeare," 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The revision of the 
late J)r. Hudson's notes has been done by Drs. Ebenezer 
C. Black and Andrew J. George. Each volume has for 
a frontispiece an old title-page in facsimile reproduction. 
Mr. John T. McCutcheon's " Congressman Pumphrey : 
Tlie People's Friend " is published in book form by the 
Bobbs-Merrill Co. The cartoons and the text happily 
supplement each other, and it is difficult to say which 
is the more admirable. This publication, although 
humorous in form, is in reality a very searching and 
serious study of our present-day political morality. 

The second volume of " The Oxford Treasury of 
English Literature," edited by Messrs. G. E. and W. H. 
Hadow, is now published by Mr. Henry Frowde. Its 
special subject is " The Growth of the Drama," and it 
serves as an excellent companion to the study of Shake- 
speare, by exhibiting the work of his predecessors and 
contemporaries. 

« The Story of Father Van den Brock, O.P," is an 
addition to the " Lakeside Series of English Readings," 
published by Messrs. Ainsworth & Co. The life of this 
Dutch missionary, one of the pioneers of Wisconsin, is 
singularly well worth reading, and should prove an in- 
spiration to the serious-minded school children for whose 
use it has been prepared. 

An imexpected demand for Lord Avebury's " On 
Mimicipal and National Tradmg," which speedily ex- 
hausted the first edition, has led to the reprinting of 
this work with a few corrections by the author, in a 
cheaper form. The book first appeared shortly before 
the recent county elections in London, and was much 
quoted by the leaders in that contest. 

We mentioned recently the republication of Mr. 
Arthur Gray Butler's " Harold." Another tragedy by 
the same author, having for its subject " Charles I.," 
is now sent forth in a second revised edition by Mr. 
Hem-y Frowde. The fine theme is worthily handled in 
dignified verse, and with an effort to hold in even grasp 
the balance of historical justice. 

New editions of " Fiona Macleod's " early books, 
" Pharais : A Romance of the Isles " and " The Sin Eater 
and Other Tales and Legends," wUl be issued shortly 
by Messrs. Duffield & Company. Since the death of 
William Sharp revealed the personality behind this well- 
known pseudonym, there has been a marked revival of 
interest in these earlier volumes. 

As a memento of the recent Longfellow celebration, 
nothing more pleasing and fitting could have been de- 
vised than the " Centennial " edition of the poet's most 
typical shorter piece, " The Hanging of the Crane," 
just put forth by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
Thirteen illustrations by Mr. Arthur I. Keller reflect 
with much success the sentiment of the fines, and gain 
an added interest from having as a background the 
Craigie House at Cambridge, so intimately associated

with Longfellow's life. Besides Mr. Keller's drawings, 
which are printed in photogravure on India paper, 
there are appropriate decorations on each page of the 
text by Miss Florence W. Swan. The edition is limited 
to one thousand numbered copies. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. have begun the pub- 
lication of a " Large Print Library " with a handsome 
edition of " Wuthering Heights." The special features 
of these books are a type unusually readable and a digni- 
fied buckram binding with stamped label. They are pub- 
lished at a moderate price, and the public is invited to 
vote for the books that it would like to have reprinted 
in this form. 

The new " Oxford Edition," published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde, of " The Complete Poetical Works of John 
Keats " is edited, of ancient right, by Mr. H. Buxton 
Forman. It gives us a portrait, a lengthy introduction, 
a sixteen-line fragment never before published, and 
numerous variorum readings in the form of foot-notes. 
We should judge it to be, on the whole, the most satis- 
factory of single-volume editions of the poet. 

The University of Chicago Press will publish at once 
a book by Mr. Joseph S. Tunison entitled " The Dramatic 
Traditions of the Dark Ages." It is usual to regard 
the " Dark Ages " as a gulf which cuts the history of the 
drama sharply in two. The author maintains, on the 
contrary, that the drama had a continuous life. To sup- 
port this position he has recourse to various little-known 
authorities, Byzantine and other, and builds up a history 
of the drama in the Dark Ages. 

The thoroughness of research and the mechanical 
dignity which characterize the series of select biblio- 
graphies of American authors published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. are maintained in the latest 
addition to the series, " A Bibliography of Oliver 
Wendell Holmes," compiled by Mr. George B. Ives. 
Besides the writings of Dr. Holmes, classified in cate- 
gories, the volume gives us lists of biographies, signed 
essays and reviews, anonymous reviews and articles, 
poems of tribute, and a record of auction sales. 

The second annual issue of " The Studio Year-Book 
of Decorative Art " (John Lane Co.), has just made its 
appearance. In general form the volume is similar to 
the special numbers of " The Studio " issued from time 
to time, — which is to say that it is a paper-bound 
quarto, well-printed on good paper, and lavishly illus- 
trated in color and half-tone. Text and pictures com- 
bine to form a comprehensive guide to the artistic 
construction, decoration, and furnishing of the home 
which every householder will find suggestive and inter- 
esting, — albeit some of the matter, as for instance the 
section on fireplaces, has little practical value to any 
but the English home-builder. 

The two concluding volumes of " Literature of Li- 
braries, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries " are 
shortly to be issued by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., 
under the editorship of Mr. John Cotton Dana, librarian 
of the Newark public library, and of Mr. Henry W. 
Kent, assistant secretary of the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art. These final issues comprise " De Bibliothecis 
Syntagma," by Justus Lipsius, and " News from 
France ; or, A Description of the Library of Cardinal 
Mazarina," by Gabriel Naud^. Printed and bound by 
the Merrymount Press, as they are, these books comply 
with the strictest requirements of fine book-making, 
and are all of moment to the librarian, since they deal 
with actual collections of books and their use and 
administration.

MIUTARY MEMOIRS OF A 

CONFEDERATE : a Critkal Narrative 
By GENERAL E. P. ALEXANDER 

With Portrait Frontispiece and Sketch Maps and an Index. $4.00 net. Postage 26 cents. 

GENERAL ALEXANDER'S critical narrative of the Civil War has long been looked for with 
a peculiar interest by both military and civil students of its subject. He was a graduate of 
West Point, a brigadier-general in the Confederate army, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, 
enjoying the personal confidence of Lee and the principal leaders in the Army of Northern Virginia, 
and is probably the most important of surviving Confederate officers. 

His book is the first philosophical review of the history of the war ever attempted, and the only 
one likely to be written by a participant ; and as such possesses a positively unique value. His 
impartial judgments, deep knowledge, and vivid illuminating anecdotes make this one of the most 
important books ever published on the Civil War, and a most valuable addition to American history.

THE OLD NEW-ENGLANDERS 
AND THE REST OF US. 



Tacitus said of the Greeks that they only 
praised their own achievements. The New 
Engianders learned this trick early and prac- 
tised it late. They stood shoulder to shoulder 
and cried each other up. Like Moliere's 
learned ladies, they decided that no one should 
have any wit but themselves and their friends. 
Scattered over our country, they took with them, 
wherever they went, the totems of their tribe, 
and set them up to be worshipped by the outer 
barbarians. They had some excuse for this, 
because they, of all Americans, did acknowl- 
edge some sort of intellectual weights and 
measures. But it was inevitable, in the end, 
that the rule of their gods should be challenged, 
their sanctity questioned. Bidlied out of obe- 
dience, some of us are ready to say that the New 
England writers were respectable people who 
did good in their day, but that in the consider- 
ation of universal literature they are not much, 
and that even in the consideration of American 
literature they are second-rate. 

The thing that separates the literature of New 
England from that of the rest of the country is 
its ingrained didactic tendency. It is the out- 
come of centuries of sermonizing. The Puritan 
believed he had a monopoly of goodness, which 
he was willing to dispense to the rest of the world 
for a consideration. Now all great art is in its 
effect moral. Great beauty harmonizes and 
inspires the mind. Great humor exposes the 
hypocrisies and corruptions of mankind, and 
draws us toward sanity and health. Profound 
metaphysical thought, winging along the fron- 
tiers of the unknown, lifts us above the petty 
concerns of life, its injustices and disappoint- 
ments. Literature which runs counter to the 
conventional ideas of morality is often the most 
moral of all. Byron's " Vision of Judgment," 
with its irreverence, almost blasphemy, is moral 
because like a blaze of lightning it burned up 
the foul airs of its time. Burns's " Jolly Beg- 
gars "is as moral as the Mene, Mene, Tekel, 
Upharsin of the Persian king. Fielding's 
" Joseph Andrews " is moral, for it is a pro- 
test against sickly sentimentalism and prurient 
thought. There is Paganism in plenty in the 



300

[May. 16, 



Iliad, but has the modern world produced any- 
thing more essentially noble than the life and 
doom of Achilles? Nay, the " Bacchanals" of 
Eurijjides is moral, though it is a hymn to 
intoxication. 

Moral ideas come nearest to us when embodied 
in the forms of creative art. No precept can 
equal an example. Instinctively all the races 
of men have projected their hopes and aspira- 
tions, their beliefs, their best and truest being, 
in the large forms of literature or religion. 
Rama and the Pandu brothers, Rustum and 
Isfendiar, Achilles and Odysseus, Charlemagne 
and his Paladins, Siegfried and King Arthur, 
are instances of man's half unconscious shadow- 
ing forth of an ideal which may become a model. 
Of course, accompanying this creative effort 
there has always been much sermonizing and 
maxim mongering ; but I do not know of any ; 
literature where this is not secondary, where it 
has not been of less educational value than the 
imitation which the great figures of art have 
forced upon men. : 

The failure of the New England writers in; 
creation is due partly to their lack of sympathy ; 
with power in all its manifestations, partly tOj 
the genuine sincerity with which they held their ' 
moral code. It is the shibboleth of recent crit- 
icism, that sincerity is a poet's greatest virtue. | 
Rather I should say a splendid insincerity is; 
the germinating kernel of the imagination that 
creates. It is not to be supposed that Shake-, 
speare held with Falstaff's code of morals and 
mode of life, or that he approved of Richard or ' 
lago as men and citizens. But the joy of: 
imagination was on him, and he thought him-! 
self into their skins and delighted in the exhi- 
bition of their powers. 

The New England writers could not do this. 
They were compelled by the nature of their 
minds to import a moral meaning into, or alle- 
gorize a moral lesson out of, everything they 
touched. Once, indeed, Hawthorne in "The 
Scarlet Letter " came near giving us a genuine 
tragedy. His theme is only a variation of the 
usual French theme of three — husband, lover 
and wife ; but the situations are developed ' 
with remarkable skill, and the style, if a little 
prettyfied, is noble. The test of a tragic 
piece of work, however, is this : Does it leave 
us dull, depressed, dispirited, convinced that 
human life is a hideous mistake, or does it 
ring in our ears like the sound of a trumpet, 
does it tone our nerves like mountain air, does 
it make us feel that we are giants and able to 
contend against Fate itself? All the really 



great tragedies of the world affect us in the 
last-named ways ; even an almost inhuman work 
like " Wuthering Heights " does so ; but unless 
I greatly err, " The Scarlet Letter," like the 
tragic pieces of the Russian novelists, leaves us 
in dull despair. 

In everything but supreme creative force and 
supreme technical gift, the literature of New 
England is most satisfactory. It is thoroughly 
set up and equipped in all its branches. It has 
a genuinely great metaphysician in Jonathan 
Edwards, and a long roU of poets, essayists, and 
historians. And who can doubt that these were 
men of genius? If they could only have let 
themselves go — if they had only given their 
imaginations a loose rein into all the fields of 
life — they might have been great creators. If 
they had only wooed Beauty more imreservedly 
they might have been great technicists. As 
it is, two of the most solemn of them, Emerson 
and Bryant, have flashes of revealing light. 
But such flashes are intermittent with them, 
and more like phosphorescence than fire. Alto- 
gether, I should hesitate to place any of the 
New Englanders among the purple-wearers of 
mankind. 

Has America produced any such inheritors 
of the purple line ? I think it has. I think 
the world has instinctively selected two or three 
of our men for its real regard, while it has only 
yielded a cold admiration to the New England 
contingent. 

There is Cooper, whose work is known and 
valued all over the civilized world. His " Spy " 
is a great novel. The character of Washington 
— perhaps the most difficidt to handle of all 
historic figures — is given with wonderful dra- 
matic effect, far surpassing, I think, Thackeray's 
treatment in " The Virginians." Cooper was the 
first to extend the domain of the novelist over 
the ocean, and his set of sea tales, in their com 
bined rendering of elemental and human action, 
are hardly yet equalled. But of course his 
great work is his series of pioneer stories. The 
forest life of America, its most wonderful phase, 
starts from his broad canvases. Nobody admires 
Parkman more than I do. He tells the tale of 
the great American adventurers with fire and 
enthusiasm. But imagination is better than 
fact. The whole forest life, — nature and man, 
the shadowy woods, the rolling streams, the 
broad lakes, the hunt, the trail, the camp-fire, 
the Indian habitat, the warfare of white and 
bro^vn, of French and English, — is in the 
novelist rather than the historian. Cooper's 
Indians have been objected to as idealized. They

THE DIAL 



301 



are probably no more idealized than the heroes 
of Homer or the Highlanders of Scott. And 
Leatherstocking is one of the great figures of 
prose fiction. Cooper has terrible faults. His 
plots are often mechanical to a degree ; his 
minor characters are often irritating in their 
inanity or absurdity ; his conversations are 
almost always stilted and unnatural. But his 
broad pictures of forest and lake and prairie 
stamp themselves on our minds. It is the epic 
of the making of an empire, the disappearance 
of a race, which we follow in his books. 

At the right and left hand of Cooper, I 
should place Brockden Brown and Herman 
Melville. Brown, a miracle of nature, a Quaker 
novelist, fascinated Shelley and was evidently 
deeply studied by Poe. In force of imagina- 
tion, vividness of weird incident, intensity of 
picture, unshrinking realism, he is at least the 
equal of Hawthorne. But human nature is 
still further withdrawn from the normal in him 
than in the New England romance writer. If 
Hawthorne's world is a moonlight one, his is 
only lit by jagged flashes of lightning. Herman 
Melville has given us at least two immortal 
books. " Moby Dick " is in some sense the 
greatest sea narrative ever written ; but it is so 
Byronic, so strained and singular in its passion 
and theme, that only a recurrence of morbid 
conditions of human nature could brinsr it into 
fashion. " Typee," however, is sunny and grace- 
ful and beautiful and irresponsible, and must 
always charm. 

Irving is the second name on our list which 
the world has accepted at something like its 
real value. What ease of polished prose is his ! 
What kindly, tolerant outlook on human life ; 
what vivifying speU in his lightest touch ! His 
English sketches had a great effect on Dickens, 
but they are themselves derivative from Addison 
and Steele. But most of his group of Hudson 
River stories are as original as they are great. 
Imagination, humor, creative force, — all the 
ingredients of lasting work are in them, and the 
world has pretty well learned them by heart. 

The case of Whitman vs. the Traditional 
Muse IS yet unadjudged. If it were merely a 
matter of rhyme or metre, I see no reason why 
any poet should not be allowed to please himself. 
There are many national verse forms which are 
as queer to our eyes and ears as any in Whit- 
man. There is plenty of rhythm in Whitman's 
VBrse, as there is in some of the Bible books or 
in Blake's chants. But the matter of Whitman's 
poetry is undefined and unformed. He seems 
to me one who has tried to get the whole uni- 



verse into his brain, and in a manner has suc- 
ceeded, only it has turned back into chaos. 
Everything is fluid in him — with here and 
there disjecta membra of human limbs, trunks 
of trees, sunsets, moral virtues, and so forth, 
calmly floating about. But occasionally some 
form of beauty or power heaves into sight, and 
once or twice the whole business coalesces and 
hardens into something new and strange and 
fine. 

In discussing Poe, I wish to put aside for the 
nonce the question of his intellectual power. I 
think I have probably read as much metaphysic 
and science as most of the critics who decry 
Poe as a cheat and charlatan. To me he seems 
a great thinker, an intellect lucid and far dart- 
ing. He resembles, indeed, those early Greek 
or Hindoo philosophers whose guesses and intui- 
tions have never been excelled for profundity. 
But let that pass. I wish to concentrate my 
attention on him as a technicist. Poe is the 
great tone master of modern literature. Tone 
in literature is a certain blending of the intel- 
lectual and the sensuous for a predetermined 
effect. It requires, perhaps, a touch of morbid- 
ity of temperament to produce it, for everything 
contrary or extraneous to the desired effect must 
be shut out. Most of the epics and great works 
of prose fiction have no trace of tone. They 
are too wide-reaching, their contents are too 
various, to be keyed to one single note or har- 
monized to one tune. The drama, the lyric, 
and the prose story are the regions of tone. 
Even in these, greatness is possible without 
it. " Hamlet " begins with a tone picture hardly 
equalled even in Shakespeare, — the platform 
at Elsinore, the biting coldness of the night, the 
sentinels in their cloaks, the distant noise of the 
king's revel, and then — the Ghost. But as the 
play goes on, its intellectual and emotional con- 
tent bursts the sensuous framework, and tone 
disappears. With, of course, other immense 
inferiorities, Poe cannot come into comparison 
with Shakespeare in variety of tone. Shake- 
speare's different pieces are keyed to all the 
notes of color, from ebon black to the purest 
gold of sunlight. Poe keeps in the main to the 
dark side of the spectrum. But within his range 
there are great differences in shade and always 
absolute certainty of effect. Consider the varie- 
ties of tone in the grave sombre colors of " The 
Fall of the House of Usher," the restless bril- 
liancy of " The Masque of the Red Death," and 
the sober ordered daylight of " Landor's Cot- 
tage "; or the range between the intangible 
shadows of " Ulalume," the rich gloom of 



302

"The Raven," and the faceted sparkle of 
" The Haunted Palace." As the modern world 
of letters has mainly gone to Keats to learn 
style — the perfection of word and phrasing, — 
so it has gone to Poe to learn tone, the truths 
of keeping an atmosphere in composition. 

Poe did not set himself to write copy-book 
maxims of morality, hut the total effect of his 
work is that of loftiness and nobility. His men 
are brave and his women are pure. He is the 
least vulgar of mortals. Perhaps, if books have 
any effect at all, his tend to make men too truth- 
ful, too sensitive, too high-minded.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Visible Memorials to Burns in Scotland, a poor 
country, are surprising in number and character. There 
is, first, the cottage near Ayr, a national possession 
kept in admirable preservation. There is the Bums 
monument, a Grecian temple with statuary, on the 
banks of the " Bonnie Doon." At Kilmarnock there is 
a memorial structure, rivalling the Scott monument at 
Edinburgh in size and surpassing it in beauty. There 
is the magnificent mausoleum at Dumfries. And there 
are statues at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and doubtless other 
places. In contrast with this atmosphere of worship 
there is an incident connected with Stratford which is 
worth relating as illustrating British character and bad 
taste. On a hill, some distance from the town but dom- 
inating it and the valley of the Avon, there is erected 
a granite shaft probably one himdred feet high. It 
appears that a ^ative of those parts went up to London 
as a poor boy and by industry in the brewing trade ac- 
quired a fortune. Returning to his birthplace, he built 
this monument to commemorate his virtues and assert 
his superiority to Shakespeare! However, it does not 
behoove us in America to throw stonies. We have a 
so-called Hall of Fame in New York which has raked 
the country with a small-tooth comb for celebrities, 
but refuses to admit to its honors the one man of 
genius who coidd flavor its mass of mediocrity.

Misplaced zeal on the part of librarians was 
lately touched upon in these columns in reference to the 
bibliothecal practice of a rigid and absurd economy in 
the use of capitals. It is gratifying now to find this 
mild censure echoed and emphasized by no less an 
authority than Mr. E. H. Anderson, Director of the New 
York State Library School, an institution that, imder 
its former energetic head, made itself famous for its 
advocacy of various innovations, — in spelling, in capi- 
talization, in labor-saving but brain-puzzling abbrevia- 
tions, in unimagined applications of the decimal system, 
and in divers other matters purely technical and wholly 
external to the realm of literature and the delights 
of reading. Before the New York Library Club Mr. 
Anderson discoursed wisely on the injury librarians have 
done to their cause, both with the thinking and with the 
unthinking public, by an injudicious activity in alien 
fields. Whatever merit there might be in these de- 



partures from accepted usage that are so persistently 
advocated by theorists, the speaker declared all such 
reform movements to be outside the librarian's true 
sphere of usefulness. In one cause alone should he 
take the lead, and that is in making more accessible to 
the public whatever of good may be found in books.

Passing pier seventy, to borrow Mark Twain's 
expression, has come to be attended with considerable 
blowing of whistles and waving of flags and firing of 
guns, as if in gallant determination on the part of 
friends that the septuagenarian shall enter upon the 
" labor and sorrow " of his supernumerary years with a 
jaunty bearing and a brave show of courage. Yet no 
thimdering of cannon was heard last month when Mr, 
John Burroughs bade farewell to the sixties and began 
a new decade of life. Perhaps he was too busy wel- 
coming the return of robin and bluebird to take thought 
of this cardinal event in his personal history. As his 
readers have had ample opportunity to learn of late, 
Mr. Burroughs is a rugged foe to sentimentalism ; and 
this may account for his having thus stolen a march on 
his admirers — an involuntarily surreptitious march. 
Nevertheless he will not escape the tribute of many a 
congratulation, uttered or unexpressed, and many a 
sincere wish that he may long continue to make life 
brighter for his fellow-men by giving them an occasional 
peep at the world of nature through the wonder-revealing 
lenses of his spectaicles.

" A DUG-UP DANDY " is one of the many descriptive 
epithets applied to the poet Rogers in his lifetime by 
those who frequented his breakfasts and took note of 
his cadaverous appearance and peculiar costume. His 
house in St. James's Place, Westminster, where these 
famous breakfasts were given, has lately been suitably 
marked by the London County Council. This " most 
interesting house in London," which was sold after the 
poet's death for £50,000, was not built, it is safe to say, 
with the proceeds from the " Pleasures of Memory," 
but rather with the handsome earnings of the paternal 
bank somewhere in the City. The debt which nineteenth- 
century memoirs owe to Samuel Rogers's breakfasts 
can never be estimated: the stories that have found 
their way into print from that table of wit, and that 
are now being served up again to readers, are innumer- 
able; while the stories that failed of this immortality 
must be vastly more numerous, and, likely enough, in 
many instances, of even better quality. It is meet that 
a tablet should be inscribed to the honor of this host 
who so long and with such distinction presided over 
" the feast of reason and the flow of soul."

Extraordinary methods of book-advertising 
were to be expected of that extraordinary sensation- 
monger, Mr. Thomas W. Lawson. In London, where 
his novel, " Friday the Thirteenth," has just been pub- 
lished, he offers one thousand pounds apiece to the daily 
and to the weekly paper that shall publish the best re- 
view of the book, each in its class. There was a time 
when the sending of complimentary copies, with obse- 
quious notes, to leading critics was a common practice 
with authors, though one of which they were never 
honestly proud. But this brazen (or golden) bid for 
favorable notice passes the bounds of all that has ever 
been recorded or even imagined in this line. Half of 
London is amused, the other half scandalized, at our 
imtimid compatriot's manner of tooting his own trumpet.

British appreciation of Mr. Howells naturally 
finds expression in comments on his recent work, " Cer- 
tain Delightful English Towns." Mr. C. Lewis Hind, 
a critic of note, takes pleasure in associating " The Lady 
of the Aroostook " and " A Foregone Conclusion " with 
" that memorable week when Ibsen was first played at 
the old Novelty Theatre, when Stevenson was hardly 
known outside Edinburgh, and before Mr. Kipling and 
G. W. Steevens blazed." Ev6n in that far-off time 
there were not wanting English readers who delighted 
in Mr. Howells's " leisurely charm, genial reflections, 
well-bred subtleties, and appreciation of half -shades " ; 
and to this day there are those who greatly enjoy these 
qualities of his style, while they find " Mr. Kipling vul- 
gar, G. W. Steevens fierce, Mr. Hewlett queer." Yet 
even these ardent admirers occasionally balk at such 
flowers of rhetoric as " a blue sky thickly archipelagoed 
with whitey-brown clouds."

The late Ferdinand Brunetiere's library, of 
about 12,000 volumes, is soon to be sold in Paris, and 
Harvard University is making an effort to secure the

there are many of these among his books, especially of 
the French classics. Marginal notes, pithy and pointed, 
from the owner's pen, give character and added value 
to many volumes. Likes and dislikes are freely ex- 
pressed, — as, for instance, his lack of sympathy with 
and distrust of Renan; and his reason for foregoing 
Vinet, — "When I chance on an idea, he has always 
had it before," — will appeal to many who have had like 
experiences with their favorite authors.

rapher dwelling in the pleasant meads of Olney. With

Academy " respecting his much-criticized " Life of 
Walter Pater " : — " A hundred years hence (and I'm 
quite looking forward to the time), my book (like Bos- 
well's Johnson) will have blessings instead of curses." 
" ' Fool ! ' said my muse to me, ' look in thy heart, and

COMMUNICA TION. 



SHAKESPEARE FOR CHILDREN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.J 

I have read with much interest the commmiication 
on the subject of " Reading Shakespeare to Children," 
in your last issue. In our work of prescribing the right 
reading for children we naturally have to generalize 
broadly as to the right reading at the right age — for 
the guidance of those who have not studied the subject; 
and we endeavor to base our generalizations upon as 
wide a study of children's tastes and of children's inter- 
ests as possible. But no hard and fast rules will always 
apply, and personal experience is often more useful as 
a "finger-post " than any sets of rules. 

When I was a boy I lived in a place, and at a time. 



of book-famine. At home in a coimtry town not a 
hundred miles from the great metropolis of London, 
there was nothing but the Bible, " The Pilgrim's Pro- 
gress," and a few volumes of dreary semi-Calvinistic 
theology. No newspapers were allowed in the house, 
and such was our isolation that the United States was 
only a geographical abstraction — simply a name to 
me, — imtil one day in school we were given a copy of 
" The Times " newspaper in which a leading article on 
the outbreak of the Civil War was made our reading 
lesson for the day. 

The only things that I knew of Shakespeare were the 
scraps in our reading-books at school: and how I loved 
them! — alike for the music of the language and the 
vastness of the subjects, although I know now that I 
had not nearly fathomed their full meaning. Indeed, 
I find new thought and new meaning every time I 
re-read my Shakespeare. I did not make acquaintance 
with a single play of Shakespeare's until I was grown 
up; and for a long time it was with difficulty that I 
could read them; to follow the story was hard and 
troublesome. If the plays had been read to me when 
I was nine years old I am certain that I should not have 
had this difficulty to overcome at twenty. 

Here is another bit of personal experience : Somehow 
or other, when I was between seven and eight a four- 
page Prospectus of an illustrated edition of Shakespeare 
came into my hands. Beneath an illustration were the 
lines: 

" Pull fathom five thy father lies ; " 
and Ferdinand's 

" The ditty does remember my drown'd father." 
How that word " remember " puzzled my young brain ! 
The joy in later years of finding out its real meaning 
was, I really believe, the foundation of a love of the 
study of words which has never left me, and was a 
factor in starting me on a course which resulted in 
making me proficient in three languages besides my own. 

Another personal experience and I have done. There 
is a most interesting movement in Boston, imder the 
auspices of the Twentieth Century Club, to give special 
performances of standard English plays for the benefit 
of our school children. "Julius Caesar," "Twelfth 
Night," " As You Like It," and " The Merchant of 
Venice " have been presented. The great Castle Square 
Theatre has been packed from floor to ceiling with 
children of all ages from nine to sixteen, and it was an 
inspiring sight to watch these young people following 
the presentation of these masterpieces. 

The intelligent appreciation that they showed was 
remarkable, and the teachers are unanimous in testify- 
ing to the happy and useful results m their school work 
from the opportunities thus afforded. The younger 
ones, so far as I could see, followed the play with as 
keen a zest as their elders; and it was easy to see 
that few of the points escaped them. For my own part, 
all my observation leads me to the conclusion that the 
right time to read Shakespeare to children is just as 
soon as they can be interested in it. They will not 
understand the play fully; and, indeed, none of us ever 
appreciates fully and finally any great work of art. One 
sees fresh beauties and new meanings every time one 
comes to it. If those who object to the reading of 
Shakespeare to children at nine because they cannot 
fully understand it, were to wait imtil they could fully 
understand Shakespeare, they woiUd never read Shake- 
speareatall! Ciiarle's Welsh.

THE DIAL

Within Three Degrees of Ninety 
North.* 



" You all want to know what there is at the 
North Pole," said Commander Peary in a recent 
lecture ; and he admitted that " there is prob- 
ably nothing there, and no Pole which anyone 
can bump into in the dark ; neither is there a 
great hole in the ground or a great rounded 
mountain to mark the exact spot. There may 
be land ; the Pole may be only a spot in the 
great Arctic sea." 

Nevertheless, even with " nothing there " but 
ninety degrees of latitude and a conflux of all 
the meridians of longitude, the race for that 
mathematical point in space is an exciting, a 
stupendous game, certainly to the Arctic ex- 
plorer the most stupendous conceivable game ; 
and with each added degree or fraction of a 
degree of farthest northing the contest becomes 
sharper, sterner, more exciting than before. In 
this matter it is the last step instead of the first 
that costs so tremendously in pluck and per- 
sistence and coolest daring, to say nothing of 
the large demands made upon physical strength 
and pecuniary resources. It is a contest that, 
even in the reading of it, quickens the pulse of 
the pale student in his closet. The feelings of 
the participant himself, as touched upon a few 
months ago by Commander Peary in receiving 
from President Roosevelt's hand the Hubbard 
Medal of the National Geographic Society, 
are not beyond the comprehension of the most 
unad venturous. From the speech of acceptance, 
which with that of presentation forms the Intro- 
duction to Conmaander Peary's memorable re- 
cord now published under the title " Nearest the 
Pole," a few sentences may here be given. 

" The true explorer does his work not for any hopes 
of reward or honor, but because the thing he has set 
himself to do is a part of his being, and must be accom- 
plished for the sake of the accomplishment. And he 
counts lightly hardships, risks, obstacles, if only they 
do not bar him from his goal. To me the final and 
complete solution of the Polar mystery which has en- 
gaged the best thought and interest of some of the best 
men of the most vigorous and enlightened nations of the 
world for more than three centuries, and to-day quickens 
the pulse of every man or woman whose veins hold red 
blood, is the thing which should be done for the honor 
and credit of this country, the thing which it is intended 
that I should do, and the thing that I must do." 

The regret often felt by a novel-reader on 

* Nearest the Pole. A Narrative of the Polar Expedition

Page & Co. 



finding a story told in the first person, is not 
unlike the feeling that may come to many on 
following Conunander Peary's perilous poleward 
course, so often do we suspect that he has denied 
us the thrills of suspense and fear and admira- 
tion that another chronicler of the modest hero's 
deeds would have delighted to impart. Yet 
there remains a very clear perception of the 
explorer's unrivalled fitness for his self-imposed 
task, of his courage, promptness, resourceful- 
ness, ability to handle men and to breathe into 
them something of his own spirit, and, last but 
not least, of his extraordinary powers of endur- 
ance and his Anglo-Saxon tenacity of purpose. 
With a boldness that often makes his com- 
panions tremble for his and their own safety, 
he combines a caution that tells him just when 
he has reached the limit beyond which lies 
foolhardiness, an instinct that whispers " turn 
back " when to go on would mean certain death. 

Of the formation of the Peary Arctic Club, 
the planning and building of the " Roosevelt,' 
its launching in the spring of 1 905, the departure 
of the expedition a few months later, and, finally, 
what that expedition accomplished, the daily 
press has already given full accounts. But the 
story as told by the leader of the brave little 
band has a charm entirely distinct from its 
news value. That latitude 87° 6' was reached, 
which now stands as the " farthest north," is 
generally known ; but of certain incidents of 
glorious daring and still more glorious victory 
we are glad to have fuller details. The splendid 
pluck with which the " Roosevelt " was navi- 
gated through the ice to her Arctic anchorage 
on the northeast coast of Grant Land, whence 
in February the sledging party started for the 
Pole, is something admirable. The stout build 
of the ship and her sharply-raking stem enabled 
her to achieve the hitherto impossible. In glow- 
ing terms which sometimes refuse to shape them- 
selves into sentences — but that is no matter — 
the author writes : 

" The Roosevelt fought like a gladiator, turning, 
twisting, straining with all her force, smashing her full 
weight against the heavy floes whenever we could get 
room for a rush, and rearing upon them like a steeple- 
chaser taking a fence. Ah, the thrill and tension of it, 
the lust of battle, which crowded days of ordinary life 
into one. The forward rush, the gathering speed and 
momentum, the crash, the upward heave, the grating 
snarl of the ice as the steel-shod stem split as a mason's 
hammer splits granite, or trod it under, or sent it right 
and left in whirling fragments, followed by the violent 
roll, the backward reboimd, and then the gathering for 
another rush, were glorious. At other times, the blue 
face of a big floe as high as the plank sheer grinding 
against either side, and the ship inching her way 
through, her frames creaking with the pressure, the

big engines down aft running like sewing-machines, 
and the twelve-inch steel shaft whirling the wide-bladed 
propeller, till its impulse was no more to be denied than 
the force of gravity." 

On the 21st of April, after a desperate dash 
for the Pole through dangers and difficulties 
beyond description, the sledging party, which 
had left the ship two months earlier and had 
more than once turned anxious looks of longing 
southward and homeward, received the leader's 
reluctant command to retreat. It was high 
time. It had been an open winter, and in a 
day more the breaking up of the ice would have 
made retreat impossible. Even as it was, one 
yawning expanse of water nearly proved the 
ruin of the party. More than two miles of thin 
and bending ice had to be crossed on snow-shoes. 
The climax of peril is thus described : 

" We crossed in silence, each man busy with his 
thoughts and intent upon his snowshoes. Frankly I 
do not care for more similar experiences. Once started, 
we could not stop, we could not lift our snowshoes. It 
was a matter of constantly and smoothly gliding one 
past the other with utmost care and evenness of pres- 
sure, and from every man as he slid a snowshoe for- 
ward, undulations went out in every direction through 
the thin film incrusting the black water. The sledge 
was preceded and followed by a broad swell. It was 
the first and only time in all my Arctic work that I 
felt doubtful as to the outcome, but when near the 
middle of the lead the toe of my rear kamik as I slid 
forward from it broke through twice in succession, I 
thought to myself ' this is the finish,' and when a little 
later there was a cry from someone in the line, the 
words sprang from me of themselves : ' God help him, 
which one is it? ' but I dared not take my eyes from 
the steady, even gliding of my snowshoes, and the fas- 
cination of the glassy swell at the toes of them." 

But firm ice was reached at last, and then it 
was found that the cry of alarm had been 
caused by nothing worse than had befallen the 
narrator himself. Not yet, however, was all 
danger past. After the north coast of Green- 
land had finally and with further grave diffi- 
culties been reached, starvation stared these 
famishing and exhausted men in the face, and 
was only averted by the lucky finding of a 
smaU herd of musk-oxen. How the herd was 
cautiously approached, two weak and starving- 
dogs being sent ahead to round it up, how one 
of the poor dogs was tossed and gored while the 
other, staggering and tottering, stuck to his 
duty, and how in sick suspense a pause for 
necessary breath was made before rifle could be 
lifted and aimed, is too long a story to teU here ; 
but we give a part of its close. 

" I kicked off my snowshoes and sat down upon them 
for a moment to pull myself together. In that moment 
there passed before me all the weary days since we went 
on scant rations; the grim daily grind; the dismal wait- 



ing at the Styx for a chance to regain the world; the 
heart-breaking work through the shattered ice; the in- 
fernal groaning and crashing of the floes; the ever- 
present nightmare of more open water; the incessant 
gnawing under the belt; the bruised and aching feet; 
the burning eyes and face. ... I dropped my mittens, 
threw a cartridge into the barrel of my carbine, and 
advanced toward the herd. Faithful Ahngmalokto cried 
out — ' Don't go so near, Peary,' but this pimy herd of 
musk-oxen was a trifle compared with the lead whose 
black embrace we had all faced, and I stepped between 
the gray dog and the bull. Crack ! a tiny tuft of hair 
flew out from just back of the bull's foreshoulder and 
he had something beside the gray dog to think of, though 
he did not go down. My bullet had missed his heart 
and gone through his limgs. Crack ! the other bull made 
a jump forward, stopped, staggered a step or two back- 
ward, then lurched over on his side. My aim was better. 
Crack! Crack! the two old cows followed suit. Crack! 
the yoimger cow went the same way." 

And, in short, the entire herd was disposed of 
by the marksman-explorer, and then appears to 
have been devoured by the men and dogs, after " 
which the march over the ice and back to the 
ship was resumed and completed. 

What, after it was all over, the expedition 
proved to have accomplished, is briefly sum- 
marized by the writer. The highest north now 
gained leaves but 174 nautical miles to be con- 
quered this side of the Pole, and various items 
of information interesting to Arctic geographers 
have been gathered. The author thinks the 
problem of attaining the Pole has been simpli- 
fied fifty per cent by this latest .expedition, and 
he is evidently keener than ever for another 
attempt. Following his main narrative are 
chapters on the expedition of 1898-1902, on 
the planning and building of the " Roosevelt," 
and on " My Eskimos." A full index and an 
excellent map conclude the volume. A worthy 
accompaniment to the beautifully-printed text 
is the collection of interspersed illustrations 
from photographs by the author — some of 
them taken, apparently, under most trying 
conditions — and the colored frontispiece by 
Mr. Albert Operti. The large size of the 
page, seven by ten, is turned to good account 
in many of the fine pictures of Arctic scenery 
and Arctic life. 

As a very readable record of a heroic achieve- 
ment, and at the same time of a bitter dis- 
appointment, the volume is valuable. May its 
author live to accomplish in full the object of 
his noble striving! Percy F. Bicknell. 



The new edition of Ibsen in English, edited by Mr. 
William Archer and published by the Messrs. Scribner, 
has advanced as far as the ninth volume, which con- 
tains " Rosmersholm " and " The Lady from the Sea."

Greece under the Franks : An Unre- 
membered age.* 



The traveller in the wee gray land that gave 
culture to the western world seldom fails to 
undergo an experience somewhat like the follow- 
ing. He has sailed overseas with his mind full 
of classic lore and his eyes hungrily open for 
material monuments of the great periods ; but 
almost immediately after his arrival there comes 
before him a chapel or monastery that launches 
his memory over westward waters ; another day 
a castle nested among the hills offers a haimting 
symbol of feudalism ; a land journey northward 
carries his feet over a bridge with unmistakable 
Norman arches ; a couple of weeks later a tramp- 
ing trip ends beside a sarcophagus adorned with 
a shield on which are emblazoned the lilies of 
France. With each item his dissatisfaction 
grows more intolerable ; for there is nothing but 
irritation in one's own nebulous generalities or a 
guide-book's fragmentary information. " That 
Greece, the Morea not less than northern and 
central Greece, had at a certain epoch fallen 
under the rule of western invaders classified in 
the large generalization of the east as Franks, 
and that Venice had extended her outposts round 
these coasts and set the lion of St. Mark as her 
seal over the gates of many Levantine havens, 
I did indeed know, but little more than this, and 
nothing at all as to the origin or kindred of these 
Frankish intruders on classic soil." One finds 
little comfort in the thought that Gibbon dis- 
missed these centuries of Greece with a con- 
temptuous refusal " to pursvie the obscure and 
various dynasties that rose and fell on the con- 
tinent or in the isles "; or that Voltaire turned 
up his intellectual nose at all Byzantine history 
as a " worthless repertory of declamation and 
miracles, disgraceful to the human mind." As 
to the Byzantine Empire, Professor Bury and 
others have emphasized the fact that it was 
simply the " Later Roman Empire "; that it did 
not come to an end until 1453 ; and that it was 
literally indispensable to the cause of western 
civilization. As to the " obscure and various 
dynasties," our traveller can only repeat the in- 
sistent question : " Here is the storied land, here 
are monuments of a Frankish race. Whence and 
when came these westerners to Greece, how did 
they act and fare among her vales and hiUs ? " 
The beginning of the answer is foimd in 
the unforgettably picturesque fourth crusade. 
From Champagne and Brie, from Flanders and

Hamault, from the Rhine and the Po, there 
poured to the east a stream of adventurous 
chivalry ; but the salt lagoons of Venice defiled 
the stream, in which there was already a strange 
mingling of the love of God with the love of 
loot. The diversion of the crusade when the 
gold of calculating policy proved stronger than 
the prayers and threats of religion, and the sack 
of Constantinople by the Franks and Venetians 
in 1204, have furnished rich material to histo- 
rians, dramatists, poets, and philosophers ; and 
for our present theme this conquest is all- 
important in that it marked the establishment 
of Frankish rule in Greece. 

In the partition of the spoils the imperial 
crown fell to Baldwin, Coimt of Flanders and 
Hainault ; whUe in the share of Bonifazio of 
Montferrat were included Macedonia, Thessaly, 
central Greece, and the " lUe de Griesse," bet- 
ter known as the Peloponnese. When the latter 
monarch was taking possession of his new do- 
minions he was suddenly joined by Geoffrey 
ViUehardouin, called the yoimger to distinguish 
him from his imcle the famous marshal of Ro- 
mania and historian of the crusade. The cir- 
cumstances were as follows : A number of the 
crusaders who had proceeded by southern routes 
towards the Holy Land, the original goal of the 
movement, were drawn northward by the stir- 
ring events so pregnant with possibilities for an 
active mind and a stout arm. Among them was 
Geoffrey ViUehardouin, who was driven with a 
handful of followers to the harbor of Modon, on 
the southwest of the Peloponnese, where fortune 
threw him a golden opportunity. One of the 
archons, the petty rider of Messenia, proposed 
an alliance for the conquest of the Peloponnese, 
an easy task for the hardy mail-clad veterans in 
an almost undefended land. The project was car- 
ried merrily forward until 1205, when the Greek 
aUy died and his son denounced the compact. 
Hard-pressed, ViUehardouin made a desperate 
ride to the headquarters of Bonifazio, who was 
besieging Corinth and Nauplia. Here the for- 
tunate adventurer found GuiUaume de Cham- 
plitte, a feudal superior, to whom he made this 
simple proposal : " I am come from a right good 
country which they call Mouree. Take such 
men as you can muster, and leave this army ; 
let us go with God's help and conquer it, and 
whatsoever portion of the lands that we may 
acquire you shall deign to give me, I will hold 
of you and be your liegeman for them." Boni- 
fazio's sanction being promptly obtamed, these 
two Franks set out with a hundred knights and 
a corresponding train of other followers to the

conquest of the northwestern Peloponnese. 
The Ille de Griesse, " right good country " 
though it seemed to the northerner, presented 
a pathetic contrast with the Peloponnese of 
Grecian independence or of Roman provincial 
administration. The narrative of the decline is 
always sombre and often fearsome. Inefficient 
government, neglected tillage, decadent towns, 
interrupted communications, and devastating 
plague had wrought appalling change by the 
tenth century. Then apparently calne a period 
of comparative tranquillity accompanied by the 
growth of trade and industry, until at the com- 
ing of the crusaders the country was prosperous 
enough to afford a generous revenue without 
burdening the inhabitants to an intolerable 
degree. The people were stiU Greek in part ; 
but there had been overwhelming immigrations 
of Slavs. Nowhere was there a community 
able to offer effective resistance. Beginning 
with Patras, Champlitte swept over the west of 
the peninsula in thorough but not unmerciful 
conquest, respecting as far as he could the rights 
and properties of the conquered. The campaign 
of acquisition we may not follow ; but here is 
one picture of the invading force : 

" They looked across the waters to Helicon and great 
Parnassus lifting their storied crests in vain. For no 
thrill of old association woke response in these rude 
soldiers of the west, to whom the Greeks were heretic 
' griffons,' and the Hellenes of old, who had crowned 
the heights with wall and tower, passed for the giant 
races of an earlier world. Little recking of the me- 
mories that harbour in these immortal hills, they 
marched on through vineyard, cornfield and olive 
grove. ... At the head of the troop ride the two 
leaders accompanied by a small band of prelates, intent 
rather on the prospect of benefices than the winning 
of souls, and scarcely distinguishable by their habit from 
the lay soldier. Each knight is dressed from head to 
foot in a close-fitting suit of mail, the coif or hood of 
steel covering the head and leaving only the features 
exposed. . . . The sergeants follow the knights in mail 
that is less complete, and the humbler adventurers 
wear for defense the pour-point, a quilted garment of 
padded cotton." 

So they passed along, a typical band»from the 
pages of romance, to an easy conquest. By the 
end of 1208 the central and southeastern por- 
tions of the Peloponnese, in large part, had been 
annexed to the kingdom established promptly 
in the west. About this tune Guillaume de 
Champlitte was summoned to France, and 
Geoffrey Villehardouin, probably as a result of 
questionable methods, became recognized as 
Prince of Achaia. In 1218, Geoffrey I. was 
succeeded by his son Geoffrey II., " who gained 
almost as great an extension of territory by 
sagacious policy as his father had acquired by 



conquest." A younger brother, William, the 
next rider, had such a brilliant career that by 
1259 he had become paramovmt not only in 
Greece but in aU Romania. 

At this point we may return for a moment to 
the Greek city that is always first in our 
thoughts, although it plays only a secondary 
role in the history of this period. In 1206, 
Bonifazio bestowed the lordship of Athens on 
Otho de la Roche, whose territories, when he 
had won them, were to include a considerable 
part of central Greece. About Attica and its 
capital in the early thirteenth century we know 
but little. In the eleventh century the Em- 
peror Basil II. "bore witness to the glories of 
nature and art of which the venerable city could 
still boast "; and in 1153 an enthusiastic Arab 
geographer speaks of Athens as rich in popula- 
tion, surrounded with gardens and arable land. 
In 1185, however, the district pleaded its im- 
poverishment as an excuse for not sending the 
customary coronation offering to the Emperor 
Alexius on his accession. About the same time 
an archbishop gives very gloomy accounts of 
the material condition, with the added com- 
plaint that " the citizens, whom in his inaugural 
allocution he addressed as sons of the ancient 
Athenians, had even lost the use of their own 
glorious language, and his classic idiom feU 
upon miappreciative ears corrupted by a bar- 
barous dialect." However, there are fairly defi- 
nite traditions that Athens was recognized as 
something of an intellectual centre even during 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries ; and the 
early years of the rule of the house of la Roche 
seem to have witnessed a commercial revival, if 
we may draw any inference from the reestab- 
lishment of a Genoese commimity. In 1210 
the Megaskyr, as the Greeks now called the 
lord of Athens, joined Geoffrey Villehardouin 
in the conquest of Argos and Nauplia. At the 
close of the campaign he received the investiture 
of these fiefs, becommg for them the liegeman 
of the Prince of Achaia. About forty years 
later William Villehardouin demanded from 
Guy de la Roche a formal act of homage for 
Athens as well, and on being refused, success- 
fully enforced his claims in a fierce campaign. 
This brings us to the point mentioned at the 
close of the preceding paragraph. 

The same year that saw William Villehar- 
douin so powerful in the east witnessed his 
humiliation : for at the end of 1259 he was de- 
feated and carried as a captive to the Emperor 
Michael. His ransom in 1262 involved im- 
portant cessions of territory as well as formal

submission to the overlordship of the Greek 
Emperor. The remainder of his reign is a story 
of desperate struggles against the eastern poten- 
tate and his fatal involution in the strife of Italy, 
nntil the Prince of Achaia became " instead of 
the protagonist in Romania, a mere pawn in 
the far-reaching schemes of Charles of Anjou." 
His death in 1278 closes the most attractive 
period of the romantic story of Achaia. 

At the history of the next one hundred and 
fifty years we may not even glimpse, although 
the fortunes of Isabelle Villehardouin, the career 
of the Catalan company, the practical annihila- 
tion of the historical chivalry of Romania in 
one fatal day in the marshes of Boeotia, the 
political activities of the Acciajuoli, — the steel- 
kings of the mediaeval world, — offer tempting 
vistas. These were the days when three hun- 
dred Franks might turn the tide against ten 
thousand soldiers of the east ; when a noble lady 
was required to go unhesitatingly into alien cap- 
tivity as hostage for her husband's overlord ; 
when an arm of John the Baptist was accepted 
as adequate security for a loan of five thousand 
golden hyperpers. Puny campaigns and petty 
feuds grow tiresome ; but always the story has 
life and movement. Now it carries the reader 
to Athens and sea-girt Euboea ; now to Con- 
stantinople, the seat of the tottering and incon- 
gruous eastern empire ; now westward to Italy, 
with the threads of Venetian commercial intrigue 
and the varied webs of papal and imperial policy ; 
now further still to France, where the king was 
yet the fount and head of chivalry. In the 
latter part of the fourteenth century a lease of 
the principality of Achaia was conceded to the 
Knights of Rhodes by Otho of Brunswick, and 
from this point we have " an epoch of conflicting 
claims and provisional administration." There 
were " Princes of Achaia " until the downfall of 
Centurione Zaccaria II., who ruled over a scanty 
remainder of this once prosperous dominion, and 
died in 1432. "With him perished the last 
Frank whose name is known to history, and 
with the exception of the ports that were held by 
Venice, the peninsula was once more in the hands 
of the Greeks." Thus ends the Grecian chapter 
in the great book of romantic chivalry. 

For this chapter English readers have de- 
pended principally on the sections in Finlay's 
" History of Greece," and on Leake's books of 
travel. The French have had the works of 
Buchon and the later study of La Baronne 
Diane de Guldencrone called " L'Achaie Feo- 
dale." The researches of the German scholar 
Hopf resulted in a mass of material that one 



can only describe as colossal and chaotic ; but 
from the heap more pragmatic historians are 
sorting out valuable ore. Of late years in- 
terest m the period has been more active and 
fruitful. English students have recently been 
conducting carefid investigations on Greek soil ; 
and the second volume of Ernst Gerland's am- 
bitious "Geschichte der lateinischen Kaiser- 
reichs von Konstantinopel " will be devoted to 
the " Frankenherrschaft in Griechenland." 

Many years ago Sir Rennell Rodd, then an 
attache of the British embassy in Athens, find- 
ing himself in the mood of puzzled discontent 
of the traveller with whom we began our notice, 
determined to write a history of Mediaeval 
Greece. Through a busy life of letters and 
diplomatic service his aim was never lost from 
sight, although the scope of the proposed work 
was gradually narrowed until it assumed the 
form of the volumes on our table. The product 
bears every mark of loving toil. Our author has 
spared no effort to reach available sources, or to 
make his results perfectly clear. The style is 
simple and direct. In the nature of things, the 
average reader cannot be promised continuous 
enjoyment from over six hundred octavo pages 
of rather detailed study ; nor will even the elect 
find their pleasure uninterrupted. However, 
all students of mediaeval history or problems of 
feudalism, all lovers of Greece, and many gen- 
eral readers who find pleasure in strolling be- 
yond the beaten path, will gladly acknowledge 
the fruitftd service of the titled enthusiast who 
has given us " The Princes of Achaia and the 
Chronicles of Morea "; and perhaps in passing 
we might point out that any writer of historical 
novels would find material for at least half a 
dozen " thrillers " in this straightforward narra- 
tive. Where an author has given so much, it is 
perhaps ungracious to ask for more ; but one 
misses a connected treatment of the domestic 
life and industrial conditions. There are tan- 
talizing mentions of the textile industries of 
Thebes and the current products of the Morea, 
which only serve to whet our appetites. The 
very fact that recorded information on such 
topics is scanty indeed would have made us 
more gratef id for a couple of chapters embody- 
ing our author's conclusions based upon his 
intimate knowledge of the conditions of modern 
Greek life and his extended studies in the 
Prankish period. As it is, he deserves our 
thanks for a valuable piece of work that brings

title seems to demand a brief note on " The 
Chronicle of Morea." It will be recalled that 
there is a Greek record, in various manuscripts, 
of the conquest of Morea; and a French ver- 
sion, rather abbreviated, carrying the history 
some ten years further down than the Greek 
poem as we have it. Obviously here is a glori- 
ous opportunity for controversy, and the oppor- 
tunity has not been neglected. Avoiding any 
part therein, we may summarize the conclusion 
of our author, who attributes great importance 
to the studies and opinions of Professor John 
Schmitt, the latest and best editor of the 
Chronicle. There existed in the castle of St. 
Omer at Thebes after the year 1227 a history 
of the conquest of Romania and Morea, which 
we assume to have been a Greek metrical re- 
cord of events up to 1304, written originally 
about that year and brought up to date from 
time to time. From this original the existing 
Greek and French versions are derived directly. 
The author, who was exclusively Frankish and 
Catholic in sentiment, may have been a clerk 
or notary in the retinue of the brilliant young 
Nicholas III. de St. Omer. At any rate, the 
"genesis of the Chronicle may be assigned 
without question to the early years of the four- 
teenth century, to a period that is very near 
the events recorded, many of which were still 
a living memory, while its value as a picture of 
contemporary thought and manners, during this 
obscure epoch of history, can hardly be over- 
rated." 

About the book as a thing to be handled we 
would say just a word. There is a clear-cut 
introduction dealing with historical authorities. 
A readable account of the fourth crusade, in- 
cluding the sack of Constantinople and the 
partition of the empire, is given as a sort of 
prologue occupying about a hundred pages. The 
history from the time of Otho of Brunswick to 
the Greek restoration is summarized as an epi- 
logue. There are three appendices, the third 
of which contains helpful genealogical tables; 
also a map, which might have been better ; and 
an index, which is welcome, although it ought 
to be fuller in view of the value and nature of 
the contents of these two acceptable volumes.

The Maxy-Sided IjEighton.* 

It is difficult to imagine a biography of 
Frederic Leighton that should lack interest and 
inspiration, so full and varied was his career, 
so rich both in spiritual graces and material 
achievements. The complexity — or shall we 
say the simple himianity — of his temperament, 
and the consequent variety of his interests and 
activities, will indeed tend to baffle a biographer. 
His was not one of those intense artistic natures 
that lend themselves easily to picturesque re- 
miniscence and spicy anecdote. Exaggeration 
and affectation were utterly foreign to his 
genius. He would no more have fondled Ros- 
setti's wombats or indulged in a Whistlerian 
tilt with the critics than he would have painted 
the Blessed Damozel or dashed off a Nocturne 
in Black and Gold. His Pre-Raphaelite con- 
temporaries considered him an arrant Philistine, 
but they always found him a friend, just, tol- 
erant, and kindly ; as indeed did everyone who 
came in contact with him, whether in private 
or official relations. " I am a workman first 
and an official afterwards," Leighton said once ; 
but it is probably as an official, an encourager 
and patron of English art, that his influence 
was strongest and most endiiring, and his ideals 
were best expressed. There was nothing radi- 
cal in those ideals ; like everything about 
Leighton, they were thoroughly sane and self- 
controlled. Perfect sanity, remarkable social 
and executive gifts, a keen sense of duty, un- 
flagging industry, unfaUing enthusiasm for the 
best things — here is a rare combination of quali- 
ties, and particularly rare in an artist. The 
life of such a man cannot fail to yield a pleasant 
and profitable study. 

The present biography, " The Life, Letters, 
and Work of Frederic Leighton," by Mrs. 
Russell Barrington, will undoubtedly remain 
the authoritative account of the matter. The 
ten years that have passed since Leighton's 
death lend sufficient perspective to the view. 
Mrs. Barrington was a personal friend of Leigh- 
ton's, and, being herself an artist, is familiar at 
first hand with the artistic situation in his time. 
His family and friends have furnished her with 
a voluminous mass of letters and with valuable 
notes on certain aspects of Leighton's career ; 
and drawings, studies, and finished pictures have 
been freely lent her for reproduction.

two large octavo volumes which embody the life 
and letters will not easily be surpassed. With 
the exception of the Watts portraits, a few draw- 
ings by Steinle, Leighton's favorite master, and 
a view of the famous Arab Hall in Leighton 
House, practically all the illustrations reproduce 
Leighton's own work. They include sketches, 
studies, drawings of flowers and leaves, water 
colors, such as Leighton was fond of painting 
in Italy and the East, a set of illustrations for 
" Romola," several statues, portraits — gener- 
ally painted by Leighton as pot-boilers, — and 
a representative selection of the finished pictures 
on which his fame as an artist rests. 

" The mind in creation is as a fading coal," 
Shelley said once ; and Leighton felt the same 
thing and tried in many ways to guard against 
it, although in the end his sacrifice of inspirar 
tion to elaborate finish was always deliberate. 
The powerful sweep and spontaneous suggestive- 
ness of some of the studies will therefore amaze 
readers who know only the cold classicism of 
most of the paintings ; while others attest a love 
of nature and an attention to her slightest de- 
tails that would do honor to Hunt's model Pre- 
Raphaelite. Some of the less significant studies 
might easily be spared, but taken as a whole 
the illustrations, \\^hich are excellently repro- 
duced, offer a complete and striking exemplifi- 
cation of Leighton's methods and abilities. The 
binding of the volumes exhibits xinusual taste, 
and despite their bidk they are light and easily 
handled. 

Unfortunately, Mrs. Barrington is not as 
skilful in arranging and adapting her material 
as she has been industrious in collecting it. The 
inherent difficulties of the subject are exagger- 
ated rather than avoided by her treatment. She 
does not understand the art of compression. 
Anxious to give just the right effect, she is 
unwilling to omit anything that can possibly be 
suggestive. The result is seven hundred pages 
— including, characteristically, a preface, two 
introductions and an appendix, — burdened with 
a mass of raw material, which, had it been judi- 
ciously sifted, would have produced a clear-cut, 
lucid impression, where now there are only 
blurred outlines, obscured by the mass of 
" original documents." Unhappily, the reader 
of present-day biography is thoroughly accus- 
tomed to this state of things ; he is used to being 
his own editor, and he wiU assume the respon- 
sibility in this case the more readily in propor- 
tion as Mrs. Barrington has more than the usual 
excuse for failing to detach the salient features in 
so vast a panorama as Leighton's life offers. 



The most vital part of the biography is con- 
tained in the first volume, which deals with 
Leighton's student days, and shows him tri- 
umphing over bad health, weak eyes, and family 
opposition in his choice and pursuit of his art, 
revelling in Steinle's instruction at Frankfort, 
loving Rome and Italy, hating Paris, and finally 
achieving his first great triumph by the sale of 
his exhibition picture, " Cimabue's Madonna/' 
to the Queen. 

Leighton's letters, most of them to his mother, 
tell much of the story. They are long for a 
boy's letters, introspective in parts, and in parts 
very lively. Characteristically enthusiastic is 
this bit about a journey to Holland, taken when 
he was twenty-two : 

" There I am at the Hague. Pretty place, the Hague, 
clean, quaint, cheerful, and ain't the Dutch just fond of 
smoking out of long clay pipes! And the pictures, Oh 
the pictures, A h the pictures ! That magnificent Rem- 
brandt! glowing, flooded with light, clear as amber, and 
do you twig the grey canvas ? What Vandykes ! what 
dignity, calm, gently breathing, and a searching 
thoughtfulness in the gaze, amounting almost to fas- 
cination. ... I catch myself bearing something in 
mmd! 'And yet, after all '(with an argumentative 
hitch of the cravat) ' all that those fellows had in ad- 
vance of us was a palette and brushes, and that we've 
got too !" 

Leighton's gentleness of spirit is nowhere 
better shown than in the perfection of his family 
relations. His mother was fond and proud of 
him, but confirmed ill-health made her queru- 
lous. Leighton never resented her exactions, 
apologized as heartily for imaginary neglects 
as for real ones, and was constantly trying to 
gratify her and give her a share in the pleasures 
of his busy, happy life. 

His father was an austere man, matter-of-fact 
and quite out of sympathy with his son's artistic 
ambitions, having sanctioned his studies only 
on the hard condition that he should manage 
to achieve eminence. Determination to satisfy 
his father imdoubtedly had much to do with 
Leighton's dogged perseverance. For the road 
to eminence was not easy ; the brilliant suc- 
cess of his first picture was followed by the com- 
plete failure of his second. Leighton faced the 
fact squarely, hiding his chagrin to break the 
news to his mother as gently as possible. He 
looked upon his defeat, he declares bravely, as a 
fortunate occurrence, and so must she. 

"Consider what an edge and zest I get for my 
future efforts, and what an incentive I have to exert 
myself to put down the venomous jargon of envious 
people. . . . The more they abuse the better I'll paint 
— industry against spite — I will have a pull for it." 

One obstacle Leighton never had to down.

His family were not wealthy, and he generally 
found the money he got for his early pictures 
"unkimmon handy"; but he could afford to live 
comfortably whUe he studied, and to spend his 
vacations in Italy, Germany, or the East, whose 
spell he came imder while he was still a young 
man and never outgrew. Travel was his chief 
recreation, for he hated general society as much 
as he enjoyed the companionship of a few chosen 
friends. There are many interesting accounts 
of his journeyings to be gleaned from his letters, 
and the story of one notable trip up the Nile, in 
a steamer lent him by the Viceroy at the insti- 
gation of the Prince of Wales, is delightfully 
told in the journal which he kept during his two 
months of isolation from the world and the post. 

One of the fruits of his Eastern journeys 
was " Arab Hall," the crowning feature of 
Leighton House, which he designed, with the 
help of Mr. George Aitchison, as a harmonious 
setting for his wonderful collection of Eastern 
enamels, and which, now that Leighton House is 
open to the public, furnishes an additional proof 
of the breadth of his artistic tastes and interests. 

The year after his ascent of the Nile, Leighton 
was elected to full membership in the Royal 
Academy. During the nine years that inter- 
vened before his election as president he worked 
faithfidly to further the interests of the Acad- 
emy. One of his innovations was the winter 
exhibition of Old Masters, undertaken in order 
that students who could not go abroad might 
receive a stimulus from seeing examples of the 
greatest art. His chief object in making colored 
studies when he travelled was to benefit these 
same students, whose interests he had constantly 
at heart. 

At the same time he was busy and productive 
as a painter. Even his election to the presi- 
dency of the Academy made no break in his 
habit of painting regularly from nine to twelve 
and from one to four every day. His care- 
fidly prepared public addresses, from which Mrs. 
Barrington quotes at length, his work in the 
Academy council, involving careful research 
and tiresome correspondence, his efforts in be- 
half of provincial and colonial exhibitions, his 
active interest in the British Museum, of which 
he was elected a trustee in 1881, were all at- 
tended to " out of hours." During the seven- 
teen years of his presidency he exhibited eighty 
canvases and two statues at the Academy, and 
forty-one slighter works elsewhere. Yet he was 
never too busy to hunt out and encourage a poor 
artist, or to give his time and influence to any 
project for the betterment of English art. 



When his strength began to fail and friends 
implored him to rest, he answered, " But that 
would not be life to me ! I must go on, think- 
ing as little about it as possible." 

He fought his losing fight as gaily and as 
gallantly as years before he had fought a win- 
ning one. His letters to his widowed sisters, 
written while he was travelling in a vain search 
for health, — " sowing patience and reaping 
nothing in particular," as he put it, — are full 
of hope and good cheer. The Sunday before 
he died he was busUy planning for one of his 
famous concerts, and when, on the day before 
his death, he rallied unexpectedly, he exclaimed 
to his sisters, " Would it not have been a pity 
if I had had to die just when I was going to 
paint better ! " 

Mrs. Barrington's exposition of Leighton's 
theories of art and her criticism of his paint- 
ings are just and discriminating, and she offers 
interesting critical comment from Ruskin, Watts, 
Briton Riviere, Sir William Richmond, Walter 
Crane, Hamo Thomycroft, and others, many of 
whom have furnished notes especially for her 
use. She fully appreciates Leighton's artistic 
limitations, and if she has little but praise for 
the man she is evidently sincere and probably 
just. Two popular fallacies about Leighton, 
which traced his avoidance of general society to 
snobbishness, and his success to an easy sacrifice 
of conviction to popular standards, she thor- 
oughly disproves.

England and Russia in Central Asia.* 



Professor Amiinius . Vambery, of the Uni- 
versity of Budapest, is unquestionably the best- 
informed living authority on the history and 
civilization of Moslem Asia. Fifty years of 
study and observation among the peoples of the 
central Asiatic deserts, pursued often in the 
guise of friar or merchant, have given him a 
keen insight into Moslem life and character ; 
and this, combined with ripe historical and philo- 
logical scholarship, qualifies him in an excep- 
tional degree for the production of such a book 
as that which has recently come from his pen 
under the title of " Western Cidture in Eastern 
Lands." In many publications, beginning with 
" Sketches of Central Asia " issued thirty-six 
years ago, Professor Vambery has given the

world vivid descriptions of the governments, 
religions, customs, and general state of society 
prevailing in the broad stretches between the 
Caspian and Chinese Turkestan. In his latest 
book he essays a new and more ambitious task 
— more ambitious, at least, if performed in 
the conscientious fashion characteristic of the 
author's past labors. This new undertaking 
is a comparative study of the aims, methods, 
and achievements of the Occident's two great 
" cidture-bearers " in central Asia, i.e., Russia 
and England. 

Those who are familiar with Professor Vam- 
b^ry's writings know him to be no admirer of 
Russia and Russian civilization. One need not 
be surprised, therefore, to learn from the pre- 
fatory page that the fundamental object of the 
present work is to prove the erroneousness of 
the common idea that the Russians, who in 
many respects are themselves still semi- Asiatic, 
are better fitted to undertake the civilization of 
Asia than the English, the accomplished repre- 
sentatives of Western culture, whose stiff bear- 
ing and unpliable character are supposed to be 
detrimental to its successful transmission. If 
this were Professor Vambery's first book, the 
impression of the reader, at first glance at least, 
would doubtless be that it constitutes essentially 
an effort to maintain a more or less precon- 
ceived thesis ; for the subject is one which has 
lent itself too often to loose and superficial 
generalization. But inasmuch as the author's 
views on the subject have long been known to 
be taking gradual shape with the development 
of his studies, the book appeals to one rather 
as a deliberate and systematic exposition of a 
judgment arrived at only after painstaking and 
disinterested investigation. 

The volume falls naturally into three parts, 
treating respectively of the civilizing influence 
of Russia, the civilizing influence of England, 
and the future of Islam. The nineteenth cen- 
tury is conceived of by Professor Vambery as 
the second great epoch of Occidental interfer- 
ence with the affairs of the nearer Orient, the 
period of the late Roman republic and early 
empire being the first ; though it would seem 
that the Alexandrian age and the era of the 
Crusades might well be added to the list. The 
question as to the rightfulness of this Occidental 
interference in our own day is raised, but is 
promptly dismissed with the declaration that 
without western help Asia " will never rise above 
its low level," and even though the politics of 
European powers in Asia are far from unselfish, 
culture and liberty can never come to Asiatics 



except thi'ough influences whoUy foreign. In 
a succession of semi-historical and semi-des- 
criptive chapters, the author then sketches 
the establishment of Russian authority over the 
various peoples of southeastern Europe and cen- 
tral Asia — the Ural-Altaics in the fifteenth 
century, the Ugrians in the sixteenth, the 
Turco-Tartars in the sixteenth and seventeenth, 
and the peoples of Turkestan in the latter half 
of the nineteenth. Russian operations and in- 
fluences in the three khanates of the last- 
mentioned region are singled out for somewhat 
detailed analysis. The general conclusion is 
that the rule of the Muscovite, however tyran- 
nical and corrupt, is at least considerably better 
than that of the former native princes. But 
after this is conceded, the author goes on to 
point out serious defects in the Russian system, 
and to show why, after forty years of Russian 
administration, the khanates are " very far from 
having reached that degree of intellectual and 
material development which might have been 
attained, considering the adaptability of the sub- 
jugated peoples and the means at the disposal 
of the Russian Crown." The many defects and 
abuses connected with the Russian system he 
conceives are the unreliability and vicious char- 
acter of mo%t of the officials, the arrogance and 
contempt for the natives which they generally 
display, and the indifference of the government 
to anything but political aggrandizement. Full 
recognition, however, is given the good which the 
Russians have accomplished. 

" Everyone will gladly concede that in many quar- 
ters of the ancient world, where anarchy, robbery, and 
starvation formerly reigned, the Russian regime has 
created a certain amount of order; it has made peace- 
ful intercourse possible, and given Europe access to 
many formerly inaccessible regions. But it would be 
difficult to see in these and many other advantages of 
civilization, which chiefly benefit the Russian Govern- 
ment, a ground for believing that the intellectual eleva- 
tion and enlightenment of the Asiatic can and will be 
brought about under the guardianship of Russia. It is 
only by the refining influence of culture, and the inde- 
fatigable and continued efforts in the matter of educa- 
tion, that any good results can be expected, and in this 
respect the Russian Government has been most defi- 
cient. ... A sober and unprejudiced judgment must 
lead us to the conclusion that the forty years of Russian 
government in Central Asia have so far only touched 
the surface of social life. True, they have left a slight 
impression on the external forms, but they have not 
penetrated into the inner parts. All that can be seen 
of reform or modernization in the life of the Turkestani 
is of superficial and compulsory nature ; it emanates from 
fear of the conqueror, and its chief object is to please 
the foreign lords, and to make them more friendly 
disposed." 

The reason why Russia's attempts to civilize 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



313 



her conquests have been so ineffectual, Professor 
Vambery considers to be that in Russia herself 
the staindards of culture and of political educa- 
tion are still so imperfect. Russia is yet far 
short of that stage of development which would 
enable her to stand as the representative of the 
true spirit of modern advancement. 

" Russian culture is only half European, and still 
half Asiatic, and although modern Russia has produced 
a few great personalities, yet taken as a whole its edu- 
cation is only half finished, and not matured enough to 
make it the successful civilizer of other entirely or semi- 
barbaric societies." 

The popular idea that this semi- Asiatic char- 
acter is a valuable asset in the government of 
Asiatic populations, that it facilitates mutual 
sympathy between riders and subjects and 
makes assimilation easier, is flatly rejected by 
the author. Quite to the contrary, he maintains 
that this is a serious disqualification, because 
while the process of " Russification " checks any 
natural development in the coimtries concerned, 
the western civilization, being only partial and 
poorly represented, makes little or no impres- 
sion on them. While criticizing sharply the 
work of the Russians, Professor Vambery is 
fair enough to point out the unusual difficulties 
with which they have had to contend, partic- 
ularly the unyielding antagonism of Islam and 
the inbred attachment of the Turcomans to their 
old tribal institutions. He closes his survey 
with this broad-minded observation : 

" Judging dispassionately and without prejudice, we 
must frankly acknowledge that the Russians have done 
much good work in Asia; that with their advent order, 
peace, and security have taken the place of anarchy 
and lawlessness, and that notwithstanding the strongly 
Oriental coloring of their political, social, and ecclesias- 
tical institutions, as representatives of the western 
world, they have everywhere made a change for the 
better, and inaugurated an era more worthy of 
humanity." 

England as a " culture-bearer " in Asia is 
considered, quite naturally, in relation to her 
work in India, though the divergence between 
conditions prevailing there and in the Russian 
poi-tions of the continent is so stupendous as to 
render comparisons extremely liable to fallacy. 
Professor Vambery's chapters tracing the rise, 
progress, and present state of the British do- 
minion in India cover familiar ground in a very 
interesting fashion, but the significant things he 
Eas to say are with respect to the causes of 
British success in transplanting European civili- 
zation to Asiatic soil. These causes he is able 
to reduce to a single phrase — the humane and 
enlightened spirit of British administration. 
English administrators have been successful in 



introducing reforms in India which the natives 
would not have tolerated at the hands of their 
fellow-countrymen, purely because of the fair 
spirit in which these innovations were conceived 
and executed. Public improvements, education, 
morals, charities, have been greatly stimulated ; 
and the system of taxation inaugurated by the 
English Professor Vambery considers " more 
advanced than any of the independent Moslem 
states, more advanced, even, than in many 
European lands." 

In a chapter of comparisons and contrasts, 
the author undertakes to show how, in aims 
and methods and equally in achievements, the 
empire-building of Englishman and Russian 
have been wholly unlike. For one thing, Russia 
meets conquered peoples as the uncompromising 
champion of Christianity, and compels their 
immediate conversion — thereby insuring their 
hatred at the start ; while England has never 
attacked, or in any manner sought to subvert, 
the faiths of her dependent peoples. Russia, in 
the course of her conquests, is declared never to 
have failed, as soon as her power was sufficiently 
established, to exercise a disquieting influence, 
not only upon the political, but also upon the 
ethical, social, and religious life of the people, 
in order to simplify the process of absorption ; 
while in all of England's proceedings a policy 
which is essentially the reverse stands out 
clearly. 

" The Russian conqueror is content when he finds his sub- 
jects tractable, quiet, punctilious tax-payers and willing 
tools. In his endeavours in the field of general national 
culture and enlightenment, his chief care is to teach the 
Asiatic the elements of school learning in the Russian 
language ; and amongst the Tartars, Kirghises,and Sarts, 
only those whose intention it was to become entirely 
Russified have devoted themselves to higher education. 
Russia has never concerned itself much about the sym- 
pathies of its foreign subjects; its iron grasp is never 
slackened by any softer considerations, and in the whole 
length and breadth of its conquered dominions we seldom 
come across any Asiatics who express themselves pleased 
with the Russian regime, and voluntarily conform to the 
new regulations under the Tsar's administration ; enthu- 
siasm is certainly never entertained. With the English 
it is quite different. They have always consulted the wel- 
fare of the people under their charge; they are anxious 
that the reforms and innovations introduced should be 
just and fair; wherever possible they have exercised 
charity and forbearance. . . . The English are not nearly 
so much hated and feared in India as the Russians are in 
Central Asia, for the most thorough-going, anti-foreign 
Hindu cannot shut his eyes to the justice, the imparti- 
ality, and the good intentions of the sahibs. Perfect 
imdivided affection can hardly be looked for, for the 
foreigner ruler is never an object of devotion; but the 
respectwhich theHindu cannot withhold from his foreign 
master may in time turn to sympathy, and the relation 
between master and subject may before very long be-

come quite tolerable. . . . The view that Russia will 
be better qualified than England to civilize Asia is 
altogether false. A politically free nation, occupying a 
higher cultural level, has more active measures at its 
disposal, has more strength and perseverance, and has 
nobler ends in view, than a nation which has scarcely 
emerged from infancy, which is as yet in the first period 
of cultural transition, and which, moreover, held fast in 
the bonds of a despotic absolute monarchy, has been 
unable to acquire the knowledge necessary for cultural 
activity. It is scarcely to be expected of a nation which 
itself has still so much to learn, that it will be able to 
teach others to work with better results than Russia has 
done so far." 

However frequently one may be disposed to 
take issue with Professor Vambery in his as- 
sumptions and conclusions, the scholarly merits 
of his work must be recognized at every turn. 
He occasionally falls into a panegyrical strain 
which is ill-advised, as, for example, when he 
exclaims exultingly (p. 259) that " England's 
victories are the victories of freedom and hu- 
manity; they can never be dangerous to any- 
one." But these lapses are not frequent, and 
they probably flow from the author's vivacity 
of style rather than from any inherent faults in 
his thought. Frederic Austin Ogg.

We have often thought, and now and then said, 
that when the Great American Novel came to be 
written it would have for its leading motive the con- 
trast between successful parents and their degenerate 
children, a contrast so frequently, and at times so 
dramatically, illustrated in our national life as to 
assume typical significance. This is the motive of 
" The Second Generation," by Mr. David Graham 
Phillips, as the title clearly implies. Unfortunately, 
Mr. Phillips has no style, and thus his management 
of a strongly-conceived situation becomes bald and 
unconvincing. He tells us the story of a successful 
manufacturer, sprung from the plain people, who dis- 
covers that his children — a son and a daughter — 
have grown up without any sense of social responsi- 
bility, and with no idea that life is to mean for them 
anything more than an unbroken round of selfish 
pleasures. Convinced that it would be a crime for

their composition, and in the end their loss proves 
their salvation. The greater part of the book is 
devoted to the slow working out of the regeneration 
of these two young lives. The moral of the story 
is so fine and true, despite a slight tincture of un- 
wholesome socialism, that we could wish the author's 
literary gift were in proportion to his ethical insight. 
In the present competition among our amateur 
sociologists to produce the most distressful fiction 
possible, we should say that the honors are at present 
with Mr. Brand Whitlock. "The Turn of the 
Balance" is about as gloomy a picture of contem- 
porary life as has thus far been produced, even in 
these days in which we learn that we are living in 
jungles ravaged by octopods. Aside from the love- 
story, there is not a ray of light in the book from 
beginning to end, and the love-story is so clearly a 
perfunctory concession to a useless convention that 
it does n't seriously count. This " vivid picture of 
the savage cruelty at the heart of our boasted civ- 
ilization," as the publishers magniloquently call it, 
is a piece of imitation Zolaism which depends for 
its effects upon sensational exaggeration and the 
accumulation of a careful selection of horrible details ; 
justice is everywhere thwarted, and evil triumphs 
at all points. The reforms in the administration of 
justice which Mr. Whitlock has at heart, and which 
are doubtless needed, are not likely to be furthered 
by such a book as this, which is chiefly remarkable 
as an exhibit of the criminal under-world, its view- 
point, its customs, and its speech. The author seems 
to be an expert in the use of argot, and displays his 
knowledge of the criminal vocabulary to an extent 
that makes him unintelligible for pages at a time. 

"The Upstart," by Mr. Henry M. Hyde, is a 
homely story of old-fashioned construction, telling 
how a boy of humble birth rises in the world by his 
own efforts, gets an education under difficulties, goes 
into politics and defeats his rivals, and triumphantly 
carries off, in the face of violent paternal opposition, 
the girl whom he has loved all his life. The scene 
is a country town in Michigan, and the various 
types of character among its inhabitants, native and 
foreign, are sketched with the fidelity that comes 
only from close observation. It is a realistic nar- 
rative, simple and straightforward, with touches of 
humor, and impretentiously successful in its execu- 
tion. 

One would fancy that at this late day a nov- 
elist would be rather ashamed to produce another 
Zenda romance — the trick is so easy, the scenario 
so distinctly planned, and the stage-setting so worn 
by use. But Mr. William Tillinghast Eldridge lias 
ventured to mount the piece once more. His book 
is called "Hilma," which is the name of the princess, 
his scene is the kingdom of Scarvania, and he trots

out all the old mummers — the rival claimant with 
his sinister partisans, the devoted followers of the 
heroine, and the American hero of superhuman 
courage. In reading a romance of this type, about 
the only thing we care to find out is whether the 
American gets the princess ; in the present instance, 
while he renounces her for the time being he still 
has hopes, and we are not called upon to shed many 
tears. The story is told in nervous and sometimes 
ungrammatical English, and its nomenclature rivals 
that of " Graustark " for weirdness. 

We have had many novels concerned with actors 
and actresses, and usually the artificiality of the life 
portrayed has been reflected in the treatment. The 
first thing to say about Miss Laughlin's " Felicity " 
is that it is free from the fault in question ; there is 
no garishness in the light which it casts upon its 
characters, who are exhibited as essentially normal 
creatures, superficially afPected, of course, by the 
accidents of their profession, but evidently human 
beings in the natural and familiar sense. Neither 
does the book invest the life of the stage with any- 
thing of the false glamour which it is apt to have 
in the eyes of unthinking people, especially young 
people ; nor, on the other hand, does it suffer from 
anything remotely suggestive of pharisaical pre- 
judice. Its actress-heroine lives the life theatrical 
from her earliest childhood, but her character is not 
drawn from footlight observation. Miss Laughlin's 
acquaintance with the conditions of stage-life is 
evidently considerable, but she knows other aspects 
of life as well, and knows that the actor is at bottom 
the same sort of person as may be found in almost 
any occupation that is not merely mechanical. Of 
course, the nature of the actor's calling cuts him off 
from that continued association with the same peo- 
ple and scenes which is the richest possession of 
normally-constituted human beings, and deprives 
him of the strength that can come only from a rooted 
existence. That this loss should be recognized 
to the full is a vital requirement of the book of 
theatrical fiction, and the fact that the present writer 
does so recognize it — that she makes it the leading 
motive of her story — is the best tribute we can pay 
to her artistic sincerity. Her Felicity is a bright 
and winsome creature, a histrionic genius and the 
idol of the public, but these facts are never allowed 
to obscure certain other facts more humanly signi- 
ficant — her longings for friendship, for the intimate 
ties of family affection, for the holy bond of mar- 
ried love. From these her profession in large 
measure precludes her, and she is not compensated 
for missing them by any amount of public adula- 
tion or any degree of worldly prosperity. An ele- 
ment of almost tragic pathos comes into the story 
when she marries an easy-going and superficially 
polished fellow-actor, and desperately tries to idealize 
his commonplace nature. There is more real tragedy 
in this situation than in the episode of his melo- 
dramatic murder which ends the brief term of their 
wedded life. We are given to understand that she 
afterwards marries the right man, but this we must 



take largely on trust, for, although he has been a 
friend from childhood, and makes intermittent 
appearances all through the book, he remains a 
shadowy personality. The failure to make this 
man convincing is the most noticeable fault of the 
book, which is, after all, a first novel, which means 
that faults are inevitable. But it is, on the whole, 
a novel of such interest and charm that we are con- 
tent to accept it, with whatever defects may accom- 
pany its qualities, as one pi the most pleasing con- 
tributions to the season's output of fiction. 

Miss Margaret Potter has written the second of 
her series of Russian novels, and called it " The 
Princess." It is an intense and tragic story of the 
Princess Catharine, descended from Alexander I., 
and of her son Constantine. The Princess is de- 
lineated as a woman of great nobility of character, 
wedded to a dissolute Grand Duke, and bearing with 
dignity the perpetual affront of his libertine life. 
Her son is the chief object of her affections, and, as 
she watches over his development, she observes with 
horror that he is fast following in his father's foot- 
steps. The climax is reached when both father and 
son fall into the toils of the same Italian adventuress. 
For a time neither suspects the other, although the 
scandal is known to everybody else in Petersburg, 
but discovery is inevitable, and when it comes the 
horror-stricken son takes his own life. The scene of 
this story is placed about ten years ago, and actual 
persons are freely introduced into the author's pages. 
Sometimes, as in the case of the Tsar Nicholas, they 
appear under their real names, at others in trans- 
parent disguises, such as de Windt for de Witte, and 
Doshoudoneff for Pobiedonostseff. An important 
figure in the narrative is the ghost of the composer 
Tschaikowsky (here called Ivan Gregoriev), who 
acts as a sort of tutelary genius to the characters 
chiefly concerned, and materializes at critical mo- 
ments just long enough to express his sympathy and 
deliver himself of some excellent ghostly advice. It 
is a pity that Miss Potter should have resorted to this 
trick of supernaturalism, which seriously weakens 
her book. 

Miss Mm"free seems to alternate pretty regularly 
between romantic inventions of the historical past 
(with Indians) and pictures of modern life. Her 
scene is always the same — that region of the Great 
Smoky Mountains which she has made so com- 
pletely her own for literary purposes. Her histor- 
ical romance of " The Amulet," which we recently 
reviewed, is now followed by "The Windfall," 
which is a novel of present-day conditions. We 
welcome the familiar description, colored and atmos- 
pheric, with which the book opens ; it has become 
reduced to a fairly definite formula now, but it never 
quite loses its freshness. Miss Murf ree's latest hero is 
an itinerant showman, who has set up his booths and 
tents in the town of Colbury for the entertainment 
of the countryside population. His troupe is in des- 
perate straits, and achieves only a dubious success 
in this last desperate venture to retrieve its foi"tunes. 
But our interest is soon diverted from the show,

and fixed upon two interesting groups of people — 
a clan of mountain-folk who are engaged in the 
exercise of their natural right to make whiskey, and 
a company of sophisticated summer visitors. There 
is an interesting young woman in each group, and 
either would make an acceptable heroine ; as a mat- 
ter of fact, the primitive beauty of the one proves 
no match for the cultivated charm of the other, with 
whom the showman falls rather precipitately in 
love. Fate smoothes the way for him by revealing 
his gentle birth and making him the heir to large 
estates. This is the " windfall " which gives the 
book its name. The writer shows herself still capa- 
ble of using the old material to excellent effect, 
although it would be foolish to deny that she has 
worked the vein until it shows signs of exhaustion. 
" The Iron Way " is a tale of the buUding of the 
Central Pacific Railroad. The author, Mrs. Sarah 
Pratt Carr, is the daughter of a man who held a 
responsible position in connection with the work of 
construction, and her childhood was literally spent 
on the road, moving with her family from one con- 
struction camp to another, as the track slowly made 
its way eastward. She is thus able to draw upon 
her personal recollections for most of the material 
out of which she has built this vivid narrative of 
pioneer experience. To satisfy the imperious de- 
mands of the novel-reader, she has invented a love- 
story of the conventional sort, but the chief interest 
of her tale centres about the railroad itself, and the 
amazing energy displayed by its promoters — the 
" big four " of California history — in overcoming 
the obstacles set by nature and human perversity in 
the way of the enterprise.

... It is remarkable how many wives of 

Jamaica t i i p 

a hundred honest men sent to live abroad tor 

years ago. ^q commonwealth have left vivacious 

and interesting accounts of the people and places 
visited in this ambassadorial capacity. Lady Mary 
Wortley Montagu in earlier times, and Madame 
Waddington and Mrs. George Bancroft and Mrs. 
John Adams in later years, come readUy to mind 
in this connection. Wives of governors sent out to 
the British possessions in various parts of the 
world have also beguiled the tedium of their honor- 
able exile by setting down things seen and heard. 
Lady Dufferin is a conspicuous example, with her 
books on India and Canada. Lady Nugent, wife 
of Sir George Nugent, governor of Jamaica from 
1801 to 1805, is less known to the world, although 
her Jamaican journal was printed (for private cir- 
culation, however) almost seventy years ago. It is 
now published under the title of "Lady Nugent's 
Journal" (Macraillan), ably edited by Mr. Frank 
Cundall, F.S.A., Secretary and Librarian of the 
Institute of Jamaica, and well supplied with illus- 



trations and maps. Twenty-five pages from the 
journal afterward kept in India close the volume 
and bring the narrative down almost to the end of 
the year 1814. Recent seismic and diplomatic (or 
undiplomatic) happenings at Kingston give special 
interest now to Lady Nugent's notes. She too suf- 
fered, not in body but in mind, from earthquakes, 
and also had her frets and worries as first lady of 
the island — very much as must have been the case 
with Lady Swettenham, to whom the editor has 
dedicated the volume. But a great part of the 
journal is devoted to things personal and domestic ; 
hence the propriety of its private circulation when, 
five years after the writer's death, it first saw the 
light in a modest way. One regrets that Lady 
Nugent met so few persons of note, with whom to 
enliven and diversify her pages; for she handled 
the pen of a clever woman and a wide-awake ob- 
server. All that editorial skill could do to render 
attractive her sometimes monotonous chronicling of 
unimportant details — for she had few others to 
record — has been done. Historical, biographical, 
and bibliographical matter is furnished in abund- 
ance. It should be noted that Lady Nugent (Maria 
Skinner) was of American birth, being the daughter 
of Courtlandt Skinner, lawyer, soldier, and loyalist, 
of Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

and doctoring, mourning, wills, pensions, public 
schools, dinner, luncheon, tea, supper, inns and 
hotels, travel, handwriting, pets, social changes, 
home, hospitality, culture, religion, superstition. 
The author deplores the prevalence of a culture that 
is but skin-deep and a learning that is only a smat- 
tering. But even smattering he seems not utterly 
to despise, for surely no book could appeal more 
peculiarly to smatterers than does this ingenious 
collection of fact and fancy, history and anecdote, 
politics and society chit-chat. A strain of moraliz- 
ing, a regretful consciousness of the degeneracy of 
the age (when was man without this uneasy sense 
of present decline ?) a wistful recollection of the 
good old days, all voice themselves in the frequent 
didactic, sermonizing note of the sections on social 
and religious and educational matters. As if to 
dignify his sometimes rather trivial theme, the 
writer freely avails himself of the aids of typogra- 
phy ; that is, he uses capitals without stint, treating 
us to a University, a Public School, a Cavalry Regi- 
ment, a General, a Cornet, a Golden Mean, a Tavern 
Dinner, and so forth. A talent for neat and expres- 
sive generic proper names accompanies this fondness 
for capitals. " Pennialinus " is just obscure enough 
to the first glance to make its recognition on second 
scrutiny a pleasing mental event. Mr. Russell's

deftly executed pen-portrait ; in " Seeing and Hear- 
ing " he still further works the vein opened in the 
two earlier volumes, but leaves the reader a little 
disposed to query whether the vein is not getting 
worked out. To try to repeat a good thing is human, 
to err is also human, but to forgive is a divine attri- 
bute wanting to most critics and to many readers. 

An astronomer was riding in a rail- 

oflhelealZs. ^^y ^^'^i^ «*?« evening, and chancing 
to look out into the darkness he saw 
Sirius, the brightest star in all the sky. Instantly, 
unmindful of his surroundings, he waved his hand 
at his scintUlating friend, as if to say, " Glad to see 
you ! How are you ? " He was very familiar with 
the history of the star, and felt as if a personal ac- 
quaintance were looking down at him. An atti- 
tude of mind similar to this is manifested by Martha 
Evans Martin in her volume entitled "' The Friendly 
Stars " (Harper) ; she wishes to interest her readers 
so that they too may take delight in the celestial 
bodies which beam so cheerfully upon us from their 
far-away fastnesses. The opening chapter on the 
rising and setting of the stars is followed by one 
in which the brightest stars are described in a general 
way ; after this a number of chapters are given to 
descriptive matter about each of certain notable stars, 
such as Arcturus, Vega, and the brilliants which be- 
stud Orion's giant form. We are informed of their 
sizes, their distances, their colors, the seasons of the 
year at which they rise and set near sunset, and of 
other facts which lend to them a human interest. 
The author is a lover of nature in all its forms. She 
notices, for example, that Arcturus rises in the early 
evening at a time " when the horse-chestnut buds are 
swelling and the elm trees are putting forth their 
first brown blossoms, and the hawks and owls and 
crows are prospecting for nesting sites among the 
high trees." The closing chapters tell about the 
constellations in detail, showing the reader how to 
find them, and calling his attention to many matters 
of interest. Some star-maps accompany these de- 
scriptions, and one can but regret that they are so 
inadequate. An attempt is made to show most of 
the constellations on a plate covering less than 
twenty square inches. The delicate, yet sure and 
accurate, touch of the author, and her genuine love 
for the sky, combine to charm the reader, and to 
make him wish to have the book within reach, in 
case he too is a lover of the heavens. 



Picturesque ^^ ^^f undulating plateau of the 
inhabitants of NUgiri Hills in Southern India lives 
Southern India. ^ t^ibe of eight hundred people called 
the Todas. The hills were first visited in 1602, 
but no definite information was ever published about 
these picturesque and unique people until the early 
part of the nineteenth century. Since that time a 
comparatively large literature has accumulated about 
them. The latest book on the subject is the exhaus- 
tive study entitled "The Todas" (Macmillan), by 
Mr. W. H. R. Rivers, Fellow of St. John's College, 



Cambridge. Mr. Rivers's especial investigations 
lay in the direction of the social organization and 
the system of kinship in vogue among these people. 
The Todas are a purely pastoral people, limiting 
their activities almost entirely to the care of their 
buffaloes and to the complicated ritual which has 
grown up in association with these animals. Their 
religion is based fundamentally upon their dairy 
work, and their lives are indissolubly bound up with 
attention to these sacred beasts. " The sacred ani- 
mals are attended by men especially set apart who 
form the Toda priesthood, and the milk of the sacred 
animals is churned in dairies which may be regarded 
as the Toda temples and are so regarded by the 
people themselves." No feature (and there are 
hundreds of complicated features) of their peculiar 
worship is overlooked by Mr. Rivers ; in fact, he 
has loaded his study with such minute detail that 
it sometimes obscures the general course of his dis- 
cussion. After describing the elaborate ceremonial 
which centres around the dairy, the author describes 
other sacred ceremonies and institutions, discusses 
the general features of their religion, considers their 
social life, their ceremonies of birth, growth, and 
death, their sacred days and superstitions, and closes 
his volume of eight hundred pages with an account 
of the relations of the Todas to the other tribes of 
the Nilgiris, and their origin and affinities. Mr. 
Rivers's book will be of decided interest to those 
who are fond of studying the diversified customs 
and habits of the human race. 



The psychoioav " T^^ Y*'""^ ^^ ^eart " ( Houghton,

other matters. wood Pier, comprises eight essays 
in observation of the writer's fellow mortals, their 
excellences and defects, their successes and failures, 
their work and their play. Particularly strong has 
the author shown himself in what may be called 
the psychology of self-conceit. Readers of "The 
Pedagogues " wiU remember that early story of Mr. 
Pier's as an unusually bright and amusing portrayal 
of certain forms of self-complacency. His later novel, 
" The Ancient Grudge," also pictures the victim of 
seductive self-deception in the brilliant but super- 
ficial architect, Stewart Lee, and in the pompously 
philanthropic millionaire Halket. From Mr. Pier's 
essay on "The Quiet Man," a study of the divers 
qualities, good and bad, that a retiring demeanor 
may hide, here is a passage not lacking in whole- 
some truth : " The looker-on is usually the man dis- 
satisfied with idleness and critical of the activity of 
others. Because it might draw upon him comparison 
to his disadvantage, he does not utter freely his 
carping criticism of the active ; but he bears in mind 
how much better he himself would do this or that 
if it were not for some forbidding circumstance." 
The chapter entitled " The Smoking-Room " is all the

observant on-looker with no fumes from his own pipe 
or cigar to dim the clearness of his vision. Any im- 
putation of self-righteousness for this abstention he

gracefully wards off at the outset. " We are all pre- 
disposed to certain habits and vices," he cheerfully 
admits, "and the vice of not smoking is one for 
which I have inherited a predilection." His passing 
reference to " the distinguished Edward Fitzgerald " 
(thi-ice thus written) betrays in more ways than one 
that he is no genuine Omarian. Enjoyment of these 
agreeable and often illuminating studies in human 
nature — most of which, by the way, are reprinted 
from the " Atlantic " — would be more nearly perfect 
did they reveal a finer sense of the niceties of lan- 
guage, a less sturdy determination, already mani- 
fested in the author's novels, to forego the luxury of 
those rare and obsolescent, but not yet quite unin- 
telligible, verbal auxiliaries shall and should. 

At first thought, one would scarcely 
fn'^^rica. associate the feudal system with 

America; yet "the twilight of feu- 
dalism was more prolonged in British Canada than 
in any other territory controlled by a European state 
or peopled by men of European stock." This is the 
statement of Mr. William Bennett Monroe, in his 
" Harvard Historical Study " entitled " The Seign- 
iorial System in Canada" (Longmans, Green & 
Co.). The author describes the first feudal grant 
of land made in France for the American posses- 
sions — that made to La Roche in 1598, to be trans- 
ferred by him in allotment to others in the form of 
fiefs, countships, baronies, and other feudal holdings, 
in return for such service or rental as he chose to 
demand. Other grants made to individuals, and 
those to companies like the Company of One Hun- 
dred Associates, transplanted the feudal system from 
France to New France or Canada, although making 
many changes compared with the parent state. To 
the Jesuits were given at different times no less than 
830,000 arpents of land, and to the other religious 
orders in total 2,000,000 arpents. The banalitie*s, 
or special grants, were exercised only in connection 
with gi'ist-mills and bake-shops. At the time of the 
annual bringing of tribute to the lord, his dooryard 
was filled with poultry, grain, and live stock. The 
corvee, or enforced days of labor, was rigidly de- 
manded by the seignior, as well as a share of the 
fisheries and ferry receipts. In 1850, the very last 
of the seigniorial rights was purchased by appro- 
priations made by the Canadian Parliament for that 
purpose, and the feudal system was at an end in 
America. The monograph is in keeping with the 
high standard of scholarship shown in preceding 
volumes of the series. 



VasarVs' 
"'Lives " in 
new form. 



It is evidence of some real saving 
grace in a book when new editions 
of it are still published after three 
and one-half centuries. That Giorgio Vasari's 
" Lives of the Italian Artists," first published in 
1550, continues to be republished, retranslated, and 
reedited, shows that it is one of the books that we 
cannot do without. We may and do reject many 
of Vasari's stories, for we know that he never con- 



sulted a document, that mere accuracy was a minor 
virtue in his mind, that personal bias entered largely 
into his appraisements, so that to be born (like him- 
self) in Arezzo, or to be a follower (like himself) 
of Michelangelo, was the surest passport to an honor- 
able place in his hierarchy. But all these deductions 
being made, it stiU remains true that he knew what 
he was talking about, being himself both architect 
and painter ; that he had seen personally nearly 
everything he described ; and that, more than any 
of his contemporaries, he was gifted with a narrative 
power and a dramatic sense which not only set him 
above all biogi-aphers of his own time, but keeps 
him among the best of all time. " The Florentine 
masters," it has been said, " are the Dr. Johnsons 
of Art ; they are so much more fascinating in the 
pages of their Boswell than in their own works." 
This is so true that the names of some artists whose 
works are merely second-rate have been perpetuated 
almost solely because of their mention by Vasari. 
A selection from the " Lives " is therefore of value, 
and such we now have in a handsome volume ar- 
ranged and translated by E. L. Seeley and published 
by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. We in this twentieth 
century have a great advantage over those for whom 
Vasari wrote, in being able to have before our eyes 
reproductions of the pictures mentioned in the text. 
The eight colored plates in Mr. Seeley's volume are 
of special beauty ; there are also twenty -four full- 
page half-tones. 

Many scholars have wrestled with 
aVouZTsoti. the Book Of Job. Its problem has 

been one of the mysteries of the 
Bible, about which writers have agreed and disa- 
greed for twenty centuries. But there is universal 
agreement that it is one of the most interesting 
pieces of the literature of ancient times. Its pre- 
sentation in the form of a drama, though not pre- 
cisely of such a drama as we find in classic times, 
lends to it uniqueness. Within recent times many 
books have appeared that have for their purpose 
the popularization of this great work. The most 
notable of these is Professor Genung's "The Epic 
of the Inner Life," which sets forth the hero, Job, 
with all his inner struggles and conflicts, making 
the work " a record of a sublime epic action, whose 
scene is the solitary soul of a righteous man." The 
newest is entitled " Studies in the Book of Job," by 
the Rev. Francis N. Peloubet, famed throughout 
the Sunday-school world for his " Select Notes on 
the International Lessons." His wide experience in 
preparing pedagogical literature has been tellingly 
utilized in the production of this book. He has 
collected striking quotations from scores of sources, 
and has so arranged his matter that by its aid a 
class or an individual wishing to do real work in 
this field can do it in an effective and interesting 
manner. A full bibliography, chai'ts, plans, and 
modern methods of study, give the student or teacher 
a real vade mecum on this most troublesome but 
fascinating book of the Old Testament (Scribner).

" The Romantic Revolt," by Professor Charles Edwyii 
Vaughan, is added to the series of " Periods of Euro- 
pean Literature," edited by Mr. Saintsbury and pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Scribner. The series is now 
within a single volume of completion, and needs only 
the treatment of the later nineteenth century that the 
editor has allotted to himself to give us the satisfac- 
tion of viewing the twelve volumes in a row. Mr. 
Vaughan's book, just published, covers the last quarter 
of the eighteenth century and the earliest years of its 
successor. It is an exceptionally interesting period, 
and the book is exceptionally readable. The chapter 
on Germany is the longest, as it should be, for it is con- 
cerned with the great period of German literature and 
thought, with Lessing, Schiller, Goethe, and Kant. 

" The Shirburn Ballads," edited by Mr. Andrew 
Clark, and published by Mr. Henry Frowde, is a volume 
which now makes public for the first time a manuscript 
contained in the library of the Earl of Macclesfield, 
Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire. The manuscript dates 
from the early seventeenth century, and most of the 
eighty ballads are new to scholarship. Such of them as 
are dated range from 1585 to 1616, which is almost 
exactly the period of Shakespeare's creative activity, a 
fact which students of our great dramatist will appre- 
ciate. As the editor remarks, this collection helps to 
bridge over the gap between the earlier ballads and those 
of the post-Restoration period. The variety offered is 
considerable; there are ballads of religion and of poli- 
tics, festive ballads and ballads of earthquakes and 
monsters. They are evidently copied from printed 
exemplars which were circulated in Shakespeare's time. 

We have commented from time to time upon the 
separately-published sections of the " Classified Cata^ 
logue of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburg," and we 
now welcome the complete work in three stout volumes, 
aggregating nearly four thousand pages. The decimal 
system of classification is employed. Author and sub- 
ject indexes fill about one-half of the third volume. 
Descriptive annotation of titles is largely employed in

" Three Phi Beta Kappa Addresses," by Mr. Charles 
Francis Adams, is a volume published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The addresses are "A College 
Fetich" (1883), the Cromwell address (1902), and 
« Some Modern College Tendencies " (1906). A good 
deal has been said about Mr. Adams's change of heart 
on the subject of the classics, as evidenced by a com- 
parison of the first and third of these addresses, but the 
author stoutly protests against the notion that there is 
any essential contradiction between the two deliverances. 
Three briefer papers, resulting from Mr. Adams's rela- 
tions with Harvard University, round out the volume to 
respectable dimensions. 

Mr. W. G. Rawlinson's descriptive handbook to 
Turner's " Liber Studiorum," first published in 1878, 
is now issued by the Macmillan Co. in a thoroughly 
revised edition. During the thirty years since the first 
appearance of this work, Mr. Rawlinson has accumu- 
lated a large amount of additional material, and the 
incorporation of this in the new edition makes his volume 
gtill more emphatically the most satisfactory commen- 
tary on the Liber now obtainable. 



Notes. 



Messrs. Harper & Brothers publish a new edition of 
" Mamiers and Social Usages," a work for which, in its 
original form, Mrs. M. E. W. Sherwood was responsible. 

Leslie Stephen's Ford Lectures, given in 1903, on 
" English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth 
Century," are now republished by the Messrs. Putnam. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a third edition of Mr. 
George Massee's " Text-Book of Plant Diseases," a 
work of great practical value to gardeners and horti- 
culturists. 

" Rosmersholm " and " The Lady from the Sea " 
make up the ninth volume in the new edition of Ibsen 
in English, edited by Mr. William Archer and published 
by the Messrs. Scribner. 

"A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the 
Gospel according to S. Matthew," by Mr. Willoughby 
C. Allen, is the latest volume of the " International 
Critical Commentary," published by Messrs. • Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

" A Text-Book of Electro-Chemistry," by Professor 
Max LeBlanc, is published by the Macmillan Co. The 
present form of the work is a translation, by Drs. W. R. 
Whitney and John W. Brown, from the fovurth enlarged 
German edition. 

A new edition of Brig.-Gen. Henry L. Abbot's " Prob- 
lems of the Panama Canal," with additional material 
covering the progress of events since the transfer of the 
work to the United States, is a timely and valuable pub- 
lication of the Macmillan Co. 

Scott's " Kenilworth," edited by Mr. J. H. Castle- 
man, is a new " Pocket Classic " published by the 
Macmillan Co. "Quentin Durward," edited by Mr. 
R. W. Brufere, is added by Messrs. Ginn & Co. to their 
" Standard English Classics." 

A new edition (the seventh) of Mrs. Mabel Osgood 
Wright's " Birdcraft " attests the popularity and use- 
fulness of that weU-known manual. There are illus- 
trative plates in profusion, and the volume has rounded 
corners for the purpose of making it pocketable. 

It takes a volume of nearly seven hundred pages to 
print " A Catalogue of the Collection of Mammals in 
the Field Columbian Museum." Illustrations of a num- 
ber of rare species add greatly to the value of this 
work, which has been prepared by Dr. Daniel Giraud 
Elliot. 

" The Greatest Fact in Modern History " is the title 
given by Mr. Whitelaw Reid to an address delivered at 
Cambridge University last summer. He means by it 
the astonishing rise of the United States to its present 
commanding position among the nations of the world. 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co now print the address in 
a beautiful little volume. 

Miss Isabel F. Hapgood's translation of Tourgu^nieff 
is now being reissued by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. As compared with the " Subscription " edition 
of two or three years ago, the present edition omits the 
illustrations and the special introductions, and reduces 
the number of volumes from sixteen to fourteen. 
There is also a substantial reduction in the price of the 
volumes. 

Mr. George Allen of London has in preparation new 
editions of some of Ruskin's earlier works, including 
the latest and copyright alterations and additions, and 
these books, by arrangement with Mr. Henry Frowde, 
will be included as Ruskin House editions in the

" The Major Dramas of Richard Brinsley Sheridan," 
a title which means " The Rivals," " The School for 
Scandal," and "The Critic," are published in the 
" Athenaeum Press Series " of Messrs. Ginn & Co., under 
the editorial supervision of Professor George Henry 
Nettleton. 

Professor Frank W. Blackmar's " Economics " has 
for seven years enjoyed the favor of teachers of the 
subject, who have found in it a practical modern treatise 
upon the science, lucid in presentation, and admirable 
in arrangement. The Macmillan Co. now publish this 
text-book in a new edition. 

" Farm Management," by Professor Fred W. Card, 
is added by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. to their 
" Farm Library." It treats of such subjects as business 
accounts, suggestions for watching markets, the time to 
market various products, and the ways of fitting the 
farmer's business to special local conditions. 

Messrs. Jennings & Graham are engaged in the pub- 
lication of a series of biographies entitled " Men of the 
Kingdom." Three volumes now at hand are "John 
Calvin: the Statesman," by Mr. Richard Taylor Steven- 
son; " Fenelon: the Mystic," by Mr. James Mudge; and 
"John Knox: the Reformer," by Dr. Isaac Crook. 

From Messrs. Burroughs, Wellcome & Co., New 
York, we have received the United States edition of 
" Wellcome's Photographic Exposure Record and

NEW BOOKS 



Dramatic Traditions of tlie Dark Ages 

By JOSEPH 8. TUNISON 
The purpose of this book is to trace the lines connecting the 
classical drama with that of the later Middle Ages. The 
critics of the ancient drama never get beyond Seneca— if in- 
deed they go so far— and students of the modern stage usually 
begin with the thirteenth century. This book aims to cover 
the interval. 368 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.25, postpaid $1.36. 

Sex and Society By william i. thomas 

This volume approaches the question of woman and her posi- 
tion in society from a new standpoint. The results presented 
are a notable contribution, not only to sociological, but to 
educational theory. The anthropological and ethnological 
materials used will be new to the general reader, and the book 
will be of particular interest to intelligent women. 334 pages, 
12mo, cloth; net $1.50, postpaid $1.66. 

The Development of Western Civilization 

By J. DORSEY FORREST 
The author has a twofold object in the presentation of this 
work: first, the discussion of the methodology of sociology 
with special reference to the study of social evolution ; second, 
the application of this point of view in the consideration of 
the development of European civilization. 420 pages, 8vo, 
cloth ; net $2.00, postpaid $2.17. 

Christianity and Its Bible By henry f. waring 

A sketch in twenty-three chapters of the origin of the Old 
Testament religion and of Christianity and a history of the 
Christian church and of present-day Christianity. It is in- 
tended as a textbook in the "Constructive Bible Studies," and 
also to assist pastors and teachers in presenting the facts 
about the Christian church which every intelligent person 
should possess. 392 pages, 12mo, cloth ; postpaid $1.00. 

First Year Mathematics for Secondary 

Schools By GEORGE W. MYERS 

A scheme is here presented which practical application has 
proved to possess marked advantages over the usual arrange- 
ment of studies. A fundamental part of this plan is a corre- 
lation of the different mathematical subjects with one an- 
other, organizing the material around an algebraic core and 
the permeation of the teaching with matters bearing upon 
the life-interests of the students. 198 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net 
$1.00, postpaid $1.09. 



Women's Work and Wages By edward cad- 
bury, M. CECILE MATHESON and GEORGE SHANN, 
F. A.. F. R. G. S., with an introduction by SOPHONISBA P 
BRECKINRIDGE 

A minute study of the conditions of life among working 
women in an English manufacturing district. Work, wages, 
legislation, home life, recreation and ameliorative agencies, 
such as girls' clubs, trade unions, legal minimum wage and 
wages boards, are dealt with in a scientific manner without 
eliminating the human element from what is too often the 
pathetic story of the lives of working women. Crown 8vo, 
cloth ; net $1.50, postage extra. 

The Interpretation of Italy during the Last 
Two Centuries By camillo von klenze 

The aim of this investigation is to study the attitude toward 
Italy taken by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with 
a view to determining, not merely what those generations 
saw or failed to see in the peninsula, but in how far Goethe's 
Italienische Reise—& book the value of which has been so 
variously estimated — shows dependence on the preferences 
and prejudices of its time and furthermore how far, if at all, 
Goethe goes beyond his contemporaries. 174 pages, 8vo, cloth ; 
net $1.50, postpaid $1.62. 

A Genetic History of the New England 
Theology By frank hugh foster 

In this work Dr. Foster gives a complete history of the unique 
theology of New England. Extracts from contemporary au- 
thors are given, so that the flavor of these writers may be 
tasted as one reads. As the first genetic history of the great- 
est theological movement which America has yet known, the 
book will command the attention of all students of our 
national thought. 580 pages, small 8vo, cloth; net $2.00, 
postpaid $2.19. 

The New Appreciation of the Bible 

By WILLARD C. 8ELLECK 
This work seeks to do three things : first, to state briefly the 
principal conclusions of modem learning regarding the Bible ; 
second, to show the enhanced values which the Bible exhibits 
through the new views of its nature thus developed ; and 
third, to point out some of the practical ways in which it may 
be most helpfully used in consonance with such conclusions 
and such views. 424 pages, 12mo, cloth ; net $1.50 ; postpaid 
$1.63.

THE ABUSE OF QUOTATIONS. 

The " Academy " proposes a Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Quotations. It would 
be an excellent idea, if only such a society could 
be given the power to administer appropriate 
punishments for the violation of its laws. The 
penalties should be graded as to severity, the 
heaviest being reserved for those blunders 
against which the public has been warned so 
repeatedly as to deprive the defence of igno- 
rance of any possible justification. We would 
suggest, as particularly deserving of heavy sen- 
tences, those offenders who credit Walpole with 
saying that " Every man has his price," Buff on 
with asserting that " The style is the man," Lee 
with relating that " When Greek meets Greek, 
then comes the tug of war," and the Declaration 
of Independence with claiming that men " All 
are born free and equal." The hardened crim- 
inality which is capable of these offences, and 
others of similar gravity, would seem to be out- 
side the scope of mercy, and in their cases no 
plea of extenuating circumstances should avail. 

Not exactly to be classed as malefactors, yet 
surely not to be acquitted of something verging 
upon criminal negligence, are those who per- 
petuate such misquotations as " We are such 
stuff as dreams are made of," " More matter 
and less art," and " There is a soul of goodness 
in things evil." In these cases, the misquota- 
tion affects only a single insignificant word, and 
therein may be found some shadow of excuse 
for the errors, but a careful writer will take 
pains not to make even these trivial slips. Some 
sort of apology is also possible for the popular 
misquotation whose motive is the pithiness re- 
sulting from condensation. It is not a very 
serious matter to speak of " a delusion and a 
snare," for few have ever hunted down Lord 
Denman's words in the British law reports, and 
found them to be "a delusion, a mockery, and 
a snare." Jefferson's famous saying about 
office-holders is another example of this sort. 
" Few die, and none resign " is really an im- 
provement upon "[Vacancies] by death are 
few ; by resignation, none." And even Bulwer's 

" In the lexicon of youth, which fate reserves 
For a bright manhood, there is no such word 
As Fail " 

does not suffer from the common epigrammatic 



328 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



misstatement, " In the bright lexicon of youth 
there 's no such word as Fail,*' although the 
violence done the original is serious and on the 
whole inexcusable. 

There is one particular form of misquotation 
that always excites our ire because of the sheer 
wantonness of the inaccuracy which it embodies. 
It is the quotation in which a word is changed 
to make it fit the construction of the context. 
We frequently hear concerning some person 
who seeks to escape the limitations of his en- 
vironment that "No pent-up Utica contracts 
his powers," or are told in accents of scornful 
superiority about " the mob of gentlemen who 
write with ease.*' Now this substitution of 
"his" for "your" and of " write" for "wrote" 
is a device legitimate enough in itself, but the 
retention of the inverted commas is unpardon- 
able. It would be quite safe to leave them 
out ; no one woidd credit the writer with having 
originated the phrase. There aire many quota- 
tions that one should be ashamed to mark as 
such, so completely have they become a part of 
the common consciousness of educated people. 
When a phrase has acquired this universal cur- 
rency, anyone should feel free to use it without 
acknowledgment, and even to modify its ortho- 
dox form. It is an over-meticulous habit that 
marks such tags of speech as "yeoman's ser- 
vice" and "the ruling passion," and "grind 
the faces of the poor," for everybody knows 
that they are older than the wi'iters who use 
them. But we insist that if quotations are 
marked, they shoidd be literally exact. 

This consideration leads us naturally to the 
overworked quotation, from which there seems 
to be no escape, short of turning hermit and 
eschewing the companionship of print. From the 
black type of the newspaper headlines and from 
the lips of after-dinner speakers called upon 
to make a few appropriate remarks, from the 
sophomorical essayist and from the garrulous 
retailer of gossip or anecdote, it emerges 
unabashed and extorts from reader or listener 
many an inward groan. It confronts us upon 
the printed page, and its deadly worl^ of hebe- 
tation is done ere we are aware ; it is mingled 
with the spoken word, and a conventional polite- 
ness makes such cowards of us all that re- 
sentment is resti*ained and the offender goes 
unscathed — presumably to multiply his offence 
to the distress of countless future victims. We 
are told for the thousandth time about the 
dearth of snakes in Iceland (or Ireland) and 
revile the memory of St. Patrick ; we hear for 
the ten thousandth time that the maker of a 



nation's ballads is more influential than the 
maker of its laws, and we wish that one Fletcher 
of Saltoun had succumbed in infancy to an ex- 
cess of oatmeal porridge. These are the expe- 
riences that make us realize how wise a man 
was Hobbes when he said — but we refrain. 

" Classical quotation," observed Dr. Johnson, 
" is the parole of literary men all over the 
world." But he by no means intended his re- 
mark to apply to those innocents who speak of 
maintaining the " statu quo," who remind us 
upon every jjossible pretext that aU Gaul is 
divided into three parts, and who, with a cynical 
and sickly smile, murmur " varium et mutabile ' 
whenever the subject of woman is under discus- 
sion. The shades of Horace and Virgil must 
experience a ghostly shudder when they com- 
pare notes about some " upstart crow, beautified 
with our feathers," who makes pretentious use 
of their words to conceal the poverty of his own 
thought. It is an easy trick, this thoughtless 
employment of hackneyed tags from the classics, 
but it does not impose upon anyone whose opin- 
ion is worth considering. Admitting the truth 
of Emerson's saying that " next to the origina- 
tor of a good sentence is the first quoter of it," 
what shall we say of the last quoter thereof, espe- 
cially if the sentence is two thousand years old, 
and has been reduced by much use to a homoeo- 
pathic attenuation of its original potency. 

Quotations from foreign languages form a 
conspicuous feature of our more ephemeral 
current literature, and their use is an abuse in 
a great many cases. It would hardly be fair 
to complain of the way in which a novel by 
Du Maurier or Mr. Crawford is interlarded 
with French or Italian phrases, because to those 
writers the foreign language in question is 
almost vernacidar, and we may be sure that 
accuracy and artistic discrimination will char- 
acterize whatever use is made of it. But it is 
different with the average young woman novelist 
who peppers her pages with foreign words (we 
may not call them strange words because use 
has made them distressingly familiar) for the 
sake of supposed effect. Many are the pitfalls 
that yawn for the writer of this venturesome 
sort, possessed of a smattering of the tongues, 
and into them she stumbles with unerring in- 
stinct. The pitfall of "double entendre" 
numbers its hundreds, and the pitfaiU of " bete 
noir " its thousands of victims. Even if actual 
syntactical dangers are escaped, the parade of 
linguistic attainment is more likely than not to 
be futile, either because it is clearly forced, or 
because it contributes nothing to the thought. 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



329 



There are occasions when the foreign word or 
phrase is inevitable, but in the majority of in- 
stances it serves only the purpose of making 
a pretentious show, and we can account for it 
only upon the theory that its exploiter reckons 
upon the carelessness or the ignorance of the 
reader. 

It is certainly desirable that something shoidd 
be done to direct the attention of reckless quo- 
ters to the error of their ways. Writers who 
can trust to memory for quotations other than 
those most familiar are rare indeed among the 
scribbling tribe. And every writer possessed of 
a conscience knows that the only safe rule is 
to verify his quotations before making them. 
Every such writer, moreover, has a distinct and 
shuddering recollection of particular perils 
which have in his own experience been averted 
only by adherence to this salutary practice. 
The suggestion of a S. P. C. Q. is, of course, 
whimsical. It gave us an opening for this dis- 
cussion, but can hardly be expected to provide 
a close. The proper training of the literary 
conscience offers the only real remedy for the 
evil, and that is a difficult matter. It all comes 
back to the question of education, and we are 
inclined to believe that in science — the science 
which the artistic temperament finds unconge- 
nial and affects to despise — - the true remedy is 
to be found. This is the essential function of 
science in our educational systems, to create the 
habit of exactness in thought and speech, and 
the literary worker needs it in its most rigorous 
form quite as much as the physician or the 
engineer. Science alone provides the efficacious 
means for controlling all the vices of slovenli- 
ness, and impressionism, and imaginative va- 
grancy to which human nature is prone, and 
which are responsible, not only for the abuse of 
quotation, but also for many other kinds of 
even more serious mischief. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A TENDENCY TO RELAPSE INTO BARBARISM, ill Speccll 

as well as in manners, a disposition to obliterate in our 
use of language those finer distinctions and shades of 
meaning that are the slow growth of thousands of cen- 
turies of evolution, and to return to the more meagre 
and less specialized vocabulary of the savage, is ever 
present among the civilized. Daily we awake to the 
sense of some new loss due to our indolence and care- 
lessness. Useful words of ancient lineage lose their 
peculiar value by being allowed to become synonymous 
with other words which needed no new synonyms, and 
we are forced to various shifts to make good our losses 
— if we can. Even so careful a writer as George 



Eliot is guilty of euphuistically in the sense of euphemis- 
tically. The writers and speakers who any longer 
attempt to distinguish between proposition and proposal, 
or indeed who use the shorter form at all, are exceed- 
ingly few. Not long ago, at a rather turbulent meet- 
ing of Harvard students, gathered to hear Mr. Stead 
on the subject of peace, the chairman. Professor Miin- 
sterberg, who has the fine language-sense of a psychol- 
ogist and a scholar, had occasion to express himself 
very nearly as follows : " Had I known this to be one 
of the objects of the meeting I shoidd not have con- 
sented to preside"; whereupon a bumptious under- 
graduate from the audience called out, " I would not 
have consented," an unmannerly incorrection that was 
approvingly greeted with laughter and applause. So 
diligent have we been, even at Cambridge in Massa^- 
chusetts, m eliminating our shalls and shoulds that now 
their correct use strikes the ear as a solecism. The 
Harvard manifestation of relapse toward barbarism 
was one of speech and maimers at the same time. 
Perhaps the one tends to beget the other.

Mr. H. G. Wells's reproof of Boston for hug- 
ging the memory of her glorious past is stoutly resented 
by that alert and patriotic New Englander, Mr. Edwin 
D. Mead, who refuses t& believe with our English critic 
that Boston no longer heads the procession of intellectual 
progress in America. Mr. Wells, it will be remembered, 
asserts that " there broods over the real Boston an 
immense effect of finality," which became fixed about 
1875. In rejoinder, Mr. Mead pertinently points to the 
" Atlantic Monthly " as still in the lead among literary 
magazines; declares that, with Harvard just across the 
Charles, and Tufts over in Medford, and Boston Uni- 
versity, and the Institute of Technology, and Simmons 
College, and all the rest, within the city limits, Boston 
is still the chief seat of the higher education in America, 
as it is also a patron of the best music to be heard any- 
where; and as for the modern intellectual movement, 
" there is not in London a centre of discussion where 
the burning questions of social reform are threshed out 
so freely and thoroughly as in the Twentieth Century 
Club's Saturday afternoons." But Mr. Mead is as tired 
as Emerson at last became of the foolishness of those 
who try to place Boston in "a theatrical attitude of 
virtue to which she is not entitled and which she cannot 
keep." He makes a good point in declaring that the 
more we study our past and our great poets, the more 
we live with and catch the spirit of these poets, the 
more clearly we shall see that in their day they formed 
the mere " remnant," the " mugwumps," the " antis," 
whom the ever-conservative mass of commonplace citi- 
zens smiled at; and the more likely will the present 
Boston be to "bring to our contemporary problems 
the radical and resolute spirit which they brought to 
theirs." All this will of course be as so much Chaldee 
or Assyrian to the intently forward-looking Englishman 
who stoutly refused even to travel the few miles between 
Washington and Mt. Vernon for the sake of viewing 
what is historically the most interesting spot in America.

The expulsion of the crucifixes ! What a title 
for a drama ! It is the subject of a long, learned, and 
eloquent brochure by Seiior Jos^ Enrique Rod6 of Monte- 
video. He writes in protest against the action of the 
authorities of Buenos Ayres in removing the Crucifixes 
from the Hospitals of that comitry, which may mean 
only a step in the new liberalism of South America. It

is difficult to overstate what the Crucifix has been to 
the civilization of that continent. As the Southern 
Cross looks down upon Andean peaks and valleys, upon 
Amazonian sylvas, upon La Plata's plains, it sees every- 
where in town or village or cluster of houses or single 
hacienda its similar work the carved or gilded Christ 
dominating human habitations. These Crosses have 
been thus planted in every remotest recess by the 
fiery yet disciplined and devoted sons of the Catholic 
Church. And the native populations have been gathered 
around them and tamed and trained and made useful 
to themselves and to society. While we of the North 
have been marching to conquest under the oriflamme 
of Poor Richard's Almanac, our neighbors to the 
South have developed a richly picturesque and imag- 
inative life under the sign of the Cross. The Dial 
has quoted before the answer made by the Padre of 
a Bolivian Mission to an American traveller who asked 
him what he taught the Lidians in his charge. " Why, 
SeKor," he said in surprise, " we teach them poetry 
and theology." And now the ideals of Franklin seem 
to be winning over the ideals held by this simple-minded 
priest. We are afraid that it is inevitable, at least for 
a time, — but it nevertheless seems a pity.

Pedigrees made to order for the American trade 
are often ridiculed, and justly, in the English journals. 
As an example, Mr. Cyrus K. Jonker, a plain citizen of 
"the states," is represented as arriving in London, 
where, with the help of the British Museum and a spe- 
cialist in ancestry, he speedily becomes the happy pro- 
prietor of a prefix, being thereafter known as Cyrus K. 
de Jonker, Esq. But why may not everyone who so 
desires lay fearless claim, even if not always in the 
direct male line, to royal or at least noble extraction ? 
Think of it a moment : Each one of us has, or had, four 
grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great- 
great-grandparents, and so on in geometrical progres- 
sion. We need go back only fifteen generations, or 
about five centuries, to find ourselves blessed with 
65,536 ancestors — diminished of course in some cases 
by the intermarriage of kin. Each one of this small 
army rejoiced in a like host of progenitors. Now what 
likelihood is there that, out of the millions who within 
recorded time are collectively responsible for our exist- 
ence, there was not some one or more in whose veins 
ran blue blood ? The lowly clodhopper is the heir of 
all the ages; and the further back he has to go to find 
his regal or ducal ancestry, the greater the glory 
thereof. Let us all, then, without any foolish pedigree- 
hunting, unblushingly assume a rfe or a von or a van, or 
its equivalent in whatsoever tongue we prefer, and in 
imagination dwell forever after with the titled and great. 

The universality of the best literature is 
eloquently urged by Mr. J. Alfred Spender in a read- 
able and sensible contribution to " The Nineteenth Cen- 
tury." Style, simplicity, profundity, human appeal, — 
these and other recognized qualities of good literature 
go naturally together, maintains Mr. Spender; and he 
adduces the writings of Stevenson, Carlyle, Ruskin, 
Thackeray, Dickens, Scott, and others of the immortals. 
" I confess," says Carlyle, " I have no notion of a truly 
great man that could not be all sorts of men. The poet 
who could merely sit on a chair and compose stanzas 
would never make a stanza worth much." Matthew 
Arnold's influence, though he emphasized conduct and 
preached Hebraism, nevertheless made for culture in 



its narrower sense. Our writers, thinks Mr. Spender, 
should be encouraged to be less careful of their reputa- 
tions and more prodigal of their gifts. We are again 
reminded that " every generation needs living writers 
to interpret the present and even to re-interpret the 
past in the light of the present." The richer and fuller 
literature for which this writer declares the public is 
now ready and waiting will come, he is convinced, as 
soon as we " banish the idea that popidarity is necessa- 
rily a mean art to be eschewed by good writers, and 
restore the true doctrine that literature is neither a 
trade to be pursued by inferior writers nor a secret to 
be guarded by superior writers, but the appeal of the 
best men to the greatest number of their fellow- 
countrymen." It is a much-discussed question — our 
present literary needs and literary outlook — that Mr. 
Spender touches on, and we welcome his honest expres- 
sion of opinion. Nevertheless there will always be a 
gifted few, in all branches of art, whose appeal cannot 
by any possibility reach " the greatest number of their 
fellow-countrymen." To how few of his fellow- 
countrymen did Milton appeal !

The Hispanic Society of America, which Mr. 
Archer M. Hxmtington has been so active and so gener- 
ous in organizing and endowing, is pushing the work 
of cataloguing its treasures of art and literature now 
gathered in the society's building at Audubon Park, 
New York City. There are at present in the library 
more than fifty thousand volumes in Spanish and Portu- 
guese, which the objects of historic and artistic interest 
in the museum help to illustrate and explain. A student 
reading in the library about fourteenth-century pottery, 
for example, may go upstairs to the museum and there 
see the very thing his author has described. In the 
words of the society's secretary, Mr. Mansfield L. 
Hillhouse, " it is the intention of the society to make it 
possible here in New York to study the history, lan- 
guage, literature and art of Spain and Portugal. At 
the present time the Spanish and English peoples do 
not understand each other. It is our purpose to do 
away with this misunderstanding." Our conflict with 
Spain, brief and one-sided and not exactly glorious 
though it was, has at least done good in quickening 
our interest in the history and literature and life of a 
picturesque and fascinating people, some small part of 
whose ancient prestige and prosperity seems now to be 
returning to sweeten the bitter cup of defeat in war. 
Curious and significant is the vitality of a conquered 
nation's language and literature. Its tongue and its 
pen often prevail where its sword has proved least 
effectual. ... 

The latest literary wrangle (of an unacrimoni- 
ous sort) reported from London, now that the Benson- 
Wright dispute over Pater is ancient history, is the 
disagreement between Mr. Sidney Lee and Professor 
Walter Raleigh over the latter's life of Shakespeare 
just published in the " English Men of Letters " series. 
Especially does Mr. Lee take issue with his fellow 
biographer on the question whether Shakespeare's 
writings reveal the author; whether, as Mr. Raleigh 
contends, " Shakespeare is the only biographer of Shake- 
speare," or, as Mr. Lee is said to maintain, the work 
of so great a creative artist is essentially impersonal — 
which was the opinion of another great creative artist, 
Robert Browning, as indicated in two of his poems. But 
even though a man may very easily write m such wise 
as to betray no secret of family history, is it after all 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

possible to write impersonally ? When a great author 
appears to achieve this impersonality we call it artistic 
detachment, and that itself, so far as it goes, is a self- 
revelation. The lesser author, striving to leave self 
behind and to attain the impersonal, becomes merely 
artificial and unconvincing; and that likewise is a rev- 
elation of the writer — a revelation, however, of his 
limitations. In one word, a Bartlett pear tree cannot 
bring forth crab apples, and men do not gather grapes 
of thorns or figs of thistles. Were our vision keen 
enough we should always see the author in his works. 

Thk right paper and light for reading is a 
matter that must always concern him to whom, as the 
old Roman bookworm long ago expressed it, life with- 
out literature is death. Dr. George M. Gould has given 
lis much earnest advice on the subject of eye-strain; 
and now Dr. Louis Bell, in a paper read before the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, cautions us 
to beware of excessive light and of glazed paper. For 
evening use the good old student lamp, easily adjustable, 
readily shaded, and, even with Standard Oil paying 
forty per cent, dividends, not costly to maintain, is rec- 
ommended. The naked Welsbach mantle, a terror to 
the rouged and faded beauty, is equally to be shunned 
by the night reader. Electric lamps likewise, even the 
incandescent, often err on the side of brilliance; while 
the arc is only less objectionable than the pitiless lime- 
light. The shining paper so common in these days 
of half-tone illustrations, especially for magazine use, 
dazzles the eyes of one forgetful that the angle of re- 
flection is equal to the angle of incidence, and even 
with the utmost care is trying to the vision. Two 
authors of a recent work on hygiene, considerately re- 
fusing to violate one of its important principles, insisted 
that their book should be printed on dull paper, although 
at the sacrifice (grievous to the enterprising publishers) 
of attractive process-print embellishments. Let us hope 
that the era of glaze and glitter in bookmaking may soon 
be past. ... 

Thomas Traherne's poems, in more accessible form 
than that of the first limited edition, ought to find their 
way to a considerable number of readers. In his now 
neglected essay on " Urn Burial," Sir Thomas Browne 
asks, " Who knows whether the best of men be known, 
or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot 
than any that stand remembered in the known account 
of time? " This query, though perhaps in other words, 
is one that naturally occurs to the reader of Mr. 
Dobell's preface to the poems. By a most curious 
chain of accidents, and after an oblivion of two and a 
quarter centuries, Traherne was unearthed, and is now, 
it may be hoped, coming to his own, although his king- 
dom may not be of quite such splendor as his discoverer 
and editor would have us believe. But readers of Her- 
bert and Vaughan, and readers of Blake, too, will find 
much to enjoy in Traherne, and will be glad that he is 
to-day something more than a " mute inglorious Milton."

Literary leisure in the civil service seems to 
be considerable among our British cousins. According 
to " The Academy," a large number of the manuscript 
novels received by London publishing houses are written 
on expensive paper bearing the government stamp. The 
inference is even drawn that " the whole strength of 
the Civil Service is engaged in the important work of 
literary production." Possibly these would-be authors 
are emulating the example of the late Andr^ Theuriet, 



who spent a large part of his life in the office of the 
Minister of Finance, but did not allow the daily grind 
to check the flow of beautiful poems and fascinating 
novels from his pen ; and at his death a few weeks ago 
he left a long list of these works of the imagination to 
his credit, besides having enjoyed Academic honors for 
the last ten years of his life. But our British civil 
servant has no Academy of Immortals to which he can 
hope to be elected, scribble he never so industriously.

An unappreciated public library is that located 
at North Charleroi, Pa. At the recent twenty-third 
annual meeting of the North Charleroi Citizens' Library 
Association the surprising announcement was made that 
in the last year only one of the four or five hundred 
inhabitants of the town had made use of the library, 
which can boast a collection of five hundred and fifty 
volumes wherewith to minister to the intellectual needs 
of the place. As one of the directors expressed it, 
" North Charleroi seems to have found too many other 
amusements, such as roller-skating, dancing, bowling, 
and card-playing, to pay attention to good reading." 
The situation at North Charleroi very nearly realizes 
the ideal fondly cherished by the Bodleian librarian 
who thought his position would be a very tolerable one 
if the visitors would only keep away. 

The yellow-backed French novel in sober dress 
is now to be seen in London, bearing the imprint of the 
well-known publisher, Mr. David Nutt. It is reported 
to be this publisher's purpose to issue a series of French 
books in cloth covers, instead of the customary yellow 
paper favored by the Paris trade. This innovation 
should appeal to the British reader, who is fond of 
things solid and lasting. In this form French fiction 
will no longer have to be read on the sly, and thrown 
into the closet at the sound of approaching footsteps. 
This outward dignity, too, may help to work a change 
for the better in the inward worth of the French roman. 
We have had the rehabilitated saloon; why not now 
the rehabilitated French novel ?

Samuel Warren's one hundredth birthday, cel- 
ebrated last month, recalls the exuberant vanity of this 
ambitious and successful author. Not content to await 
the due meed of praise that would have come to him as 
the acknowledged author of " Ten Thousand a Year," 
he chose to issue the book anonymously, and then did 
his best to make the authorship leak out accidentally 
and to the astonishment of a world consumed with curi- 
osity. His repeated asking of liis friends if they had 
any idea who wrote the great novel at last wearied one 
of them, who replied: "Yes, Sam, and I don't mind 
telling you if you won't let it go any farther. The fact 
is, 1 wrote the book myself."

The death of "Ian Maclaren" (Dr. John 
Watson) removes one of the most attractive and lovable 
and popular of authors and preachers. Eleven years 
ago he first visited this country, but two years earlier 
he had made himself well known here as a writer of 
most charming and delicate Scotch stories. His was 
another of those dual personalities that have adorned 
British literature in the last few years. Hardly less 
popular in their way than his pseudonymous works of 
fiction were his more serious writings, on matters of 
religion and conduct. It was in the course of a second 
visit to America that he died, at Mount Pleasant, Iowa, 
early last month.

War Memoirs of a Confederate 

IiEADER.* 



General Alexander's " Military Memoirs of 
a Confederate " is remarkable for three reasons. 
First, it is a critical account of which the object 
" is the criticism of each campaign as one would 
criticise a game of chess, only to point out the 
good and bad plays on each side, and the moves 
which have influenced the result." As an artil- 
lery officer the author had exceptional oppor- 
tunities for observing the battles of which he 
writes ; his position also prevented him from 
being involved in the controversies that arose 
later among the leaders who exercised independ- 
ent commands ; thus he has no course of his 
own to defend, no theory to maintain. Second, 
the work is noteworthy as a contribution 
from the Lower South. Heretofore nearly all 
Southern accounts of the war have been from 
the Virgmia point of view, — and there is quite 
a difference between the way the average 
Virginian looks upon the war and the point of 
view of a Georgian or a Texan. The Virginian 
has always had that exalted opinion of himself, 
his people, and his state that the New Englander 
has exhibited, and this feeling is faithfully re- 
flected in the post-helium writings, — the rest 
of the South must give precedence to Virginia. 
This book will tend to correct the Upper South 
notion that Lee, Jackson, and Virginia did it 
all ; the author, being a Georgian, feels no 
compunction in criticising Virginia leaders. 
Finally, it is the work of one who was a good 
soldier and is now a soimd philosopher as to 
the political results of the war, for like most 
other Confederates he insists that the causes 
and results of the war were political. An 
extract from the preface illustrates this. 

"As to the causes of the war, it will, of course, be 
understood that every former Confederate repudiates 
all accusations of treason or rebellion in the war, and 
even of fighting to preserve the institution of slavery. 
... Our struggle [was] ... for that right of self- 
government which the Englishman has claimed, and 
fought for, as for nothing else, since the days of King 
John. [But] . . . the world has not stood still m the 
years since we took up arms for what we deemed our 
most invaluable right. . . . We now enjoy the rare 
privilege of seeing what we fought for in the retrospect. 
It no longer seems so desirable. It would now prove 
only a curse. We have good cause to thank God for 
our escape from it, not alone for our sake, but for that 
of the whole country and even of the world. Had

rative. By E. P. Alexander. With portrait and maps. New 
York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



our cause succeeded, divergent interests must have 
soon further separated the States into groups, and this 
continent would have been given over to divided 
nationalities." 

Nearly all will agree that it was well that the 
political theories for which the South fought were 
lost ; but some will still maintain that the real 
cause of the war was not political but social — 
that is, the presence of the negro ; and that 
while the South lost, as it ought to have lost, 
its contention for state sovereignty, it finally 
maintained, perhaps even too successfully, its 
position in regard to the inequality of the races. 
The fimdamental cause of the war was negro 
slavery, and the fundamental outcome was the 
race problem. The South fought a long war 
for its " corner stone," and then foimd that the 
relative status of the races could be maintained 
without slavery. So the ex-Confederates can 
easily give up the superficial political principle. 

The narrative is confined to accounts of those 
battles and campaigns in which the author was 
engaged. The most important chapters are 
those relating to the first and second battles of 
Manassas, Seven Pines, the Seven Days, Cedar 
Mountain, South Mountain, Antietam, Freder- 
icksburg, ChanceUorsville, Gettysburg, Chick- 
amauga, the Wilderness, and Petersburg. The 
list shows that Alexander was a busy soldier. 
The style is clear and simple ; there is no strain- 
ing for effect, no rhetorical outbursts. The 
comments upon the principal military leaders 
and their tactics and strategy will please the 
soldier and the student, but not the average 
reader or the hero-worshipper. For the scape- 
goats, however, — McDowell, Huger, Long- 
street, Porter, Howard, and Hooker, — General 
Alexander has good words ; for their failures, 
he says, others were often to blame. 

Naturally the weight of criticism falls upon 
the Confederate leaders, since the author was 
best acquainted with the conditions under which 
they operated. Upon Generals Joe Johnson 
and Stonewall Jackson some severe judgments 
are passed. The latter is charged with shirking 
fight during the Seven Days battles in order to 
save his men and to hold Sunday prayer meet- 
ing, while Johnson is said to have saved the 
fight for the Confederates by getting woimded 
and thus out of command. Of McClellan, 
whom he thinks was often of great assistance to 
the Confederacy, it is said : 

" He would have been an excellent chief of staff, but 
was imfit for the command of an army. He was as 
utterly without audacity as Lee was full of it. His one 
fine quality was his ability to organize and discipline. 
He constructed a superb machine, which, being once 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



333 



constructed, would fight a battle with skill and courage 
if only let alone. McClellan, during the Seven Days, 
let it alone, absenting himself as if by instinct. Never 
but at the battle of Sharpsburg was he present on any 
field, and his presence, by keeping Porter's corps out of 
action, made a drawn fight of what would otherwise 
have been a Federal victory." 

The Confederate plan of carrying the war 
north of the Potomac is condemned as useless. 
" No army," the author says, " large enough to 
meet the Federal army, could support and 
supply itself by wagon-trains, . . . for any 
length of time. Whenever, therefore, we crossed 
the Potomac going northward, we were as cer- 
tain to have to recross it coming southward, in 
a few weeks, as a stone thrown upward is cer- 
tain to come down." Such criticism, it appears 
to the reviewer, fails to take political motives 
into consideration. Lee went to Sharpsburg 
and to Gettysburg to win foreign recognition 
for the Confederacy. But, as General Alexander 
shows, Lee's army at Antietam and at Gettys- 
burg was not well handled, nor were those fights 
well planned. In both places only the blunders 
of the Federals saved him. Of the Gettysburg 
fight it is said : 

" The official reports are a painful record of insuffi- 
cient comprehension of orders and inefficient attempts 
at execution, by officers each able to shift the blame of 
failure upon other shoulders than his own. Between 
the lines the apparent absence of supervision excites 
constant wonder. But everywhere that the troops 
fought their conduct was admirable. ... It must ever 
remain a grave reflection upon the Confederate conduct 
of the battle that the weakest part of the Federal posi- 
tion was the only portion which was not attacked. . . . 
Of the third day it must be said, as was said of the 
charge of the Six Hundred at Balaklava, ' Magnificent, 
but not War!'" 

The Federal commander at Gettysburg is also 
severely criticised. 

" It must be ever held a colossal mistake that Meade 
did not organize a comiterstroke as soon as he discov- 
ered that the Confederate attack had been repulsed. 
He lost here an opportunity as great as McClellan lost 
at Sharpsburg. Our ammunition was so low, and our 
diminished forces were, at the moment, so widely dis- 
persed along our unwisely extended line, that an 
advance by a single fresh corps, the 6th for instance, 
could have cut us in two. Meade might at least have 
felt that he had nothing to lose and everything to gain 
by making the effort." 

It is the opinion of Alexander that instead of 
going north of the Potomac in 1862 and 1863 
the Virginia armies should have made use of 
" interior lines " and relieved the Confederate 
armies in the West. This could have been done 
with comparative ease and promised better suc- 
cess. But here was illustrated the disregard of 
the Lower South and Southwest by the Upper 
South. On this matter the author says : 



" It is a fatal mistake that we failed to utilize the 
single advantage in the game of war, which the Con- 
federacy enjoyed. . . . We occupied the ' Interior 
Lines,' and could reenforce from one flank to the other, 
across our country, more quickly than the enemy could 
discover and follow our movements by roundabout 
routes. Only by such transfers of her armies could the 
South ever hope to face her adversaries with superior, 
or even with equal, numbers — by demanding double 
duty of her regiments, fighting battles with them alter- 
nately in the east and in the west. . . . Unfortunately 
no one but Longstreet seems to have appreciated this." 

Critical estimates are given of numerous other 
Federal and Confederate generals, but space 
permits mention of but few. Of Confederates, 
Early and Ewell are frequently found wanting, 
as at Gettysburg and in the Wilderness. It is 
worthy of note that little or no faidt is found 
with President Davis for interfering in military 
affairs. 

Of all the Federal leaders. General Alexander 
has the highest professional respect for Grant. 
Some military critics have declared that Grant 
possessed no ability as a strategist, — Mr. Rhodes, 
for example, has criticised unfavorably his con- 
duct of affairs in 1864 ; but our author takes 
issue with these. The real crisis of the war 
came, he asserts, not at Gettysburg or in any 
other battle, but just after the Wilderness 
campaign, when for three days Lee was deceived 
as to Grant's whereabouts. Meanwhile, the 
latter had safely gone before Petersburg, the 
back door to Richmond. " Thus the last, and 
perhaps the best, chances of Confederate suc- 
cess were not lost in the repidse at Gettysburg, 
nor in any combat of arms. They were lost 
during three days of lying in camp, believing 
that Grant was hemmed in by the broad part of 
the James below City Point, and had nowhere to 
go but to come and attack us." At that time the 
North was greatly depressed and almost ready 
to negotiate for peace. Had Lee reached Peters- 
burg before Grant, the latter would have suf- 
fered a bloody repulse where, as it was, he was 
only checked. The North could not have en- 
dured another defeat. So Grant's manoeuvre 
was strategy of the highest order. 

But in addition to criticism of the tactics and 
strategy of the commanders, the book contains 
a mass of information and opinion relative to 
general conditions on both sides. From no 
other account can one get so clear an idea of the 
weaknesses and the strength of the Confederate 
army. Up to the end of 1862, the author says, 
it was not at all well organized, and its cavalry 
and artillery were not used to the best advantage 
until too late. Its strength lay in its good 
leaders and good soldiers. On the other hand,

the Federal army had a splendid organization 
and fine men, but was badly led. However, as 
he shows, it fought very well without leaders. 
Of the contrast between Northern and Southern 
troops in 1861, an interesting description is 
given. Alexander had been out West when the 
news of war came, and after resigning his com- 
mission he returned by way of New York. 
Both sections were then arming. Of the ap- 
pearance of the soldiers he says : 

" The camps near the principal Northern towns were 
all of regiments. Those of the South were mostly of a 
company each. The arms of the Northern troops were 
generally the long-range rifled muskets. Those of the 
Southern troops were almost universally the old- 
fashioned smooth-bore muskets. The Northern troops 
were always neatly imiformed in blue, their camps 
seemed well equipped, and there was generally some 
visible show of military discipline about them. The 
Confederate uniforms were blue, gray, or brown, and 
sometimes uniforms were lacking. There was, too, a 
noticeable contrast in the physical appearance of the 
men, the Northern and Western men having more flesh 
and better color. As physical machines, to withstand 
hardships, a casual observer would have pronounced 
them superior to their antagonists. But I lived to see 
that appearances may deceive." 

The Confederates, General Alexander thinks, 
were inclined to use too few men in assaults, to 
fight too much and manoeuvre too little ; the 
Federals sometimes used too many men — they 
got in one another's way, as at the " Bloody 
Angle " and at the " Crater." Both sides lost 
much by making progressive, — that is, piece- 
meal, — attacks, as at the Seven Days' fight, 
Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and Fredericksburg. 
Until Gettysburg, this had been mainly a Fed- 
eral failing, — hence the saying of Stonewall 
Jackson which became " an article of our stead- 
fast faith : ' We sometimes fail to drive the 
enemy from position, but they always fail to 
drive us.' " 

Throughout the entire work, the author mani- 
fests disapproval of all " grand-stand " move- 
ments ; such cavalry raids as those of Stuart, 
Pleasanton, and Sheridan did more good than 
harm, he says, to the enemy. From the many 
military mistakes made during the war some 
fundamental lessons must be learned : orders 
must be definite, precise, and have no " saving 
clauses "; a good staff organization is a prime 
necessity ; the commander must go in person 
and see that very important orders are obeyed ; 
and there must be no confusion of authority. 
The practical application of these principles is 
shown in numerous instances. Every chapter 
is sprinkled with military maxims in the most 
concise form. West Point might well use the 
volume as a textbook on military science. 



Here and there the personal reminiscences of 
the author are sandwiched in between the ac- 
counts of battles, but not nearly so many as we 
should be glad to have. It is in this part that 
we find the significant little stories that so 
illuminate a critical text. In telling of the way 
the inferior Confederate artillery suffered at 
Antietam, he says : " As to how our artillery 
fared in opposition, we may judge from a 
remark made to me two months later by Col. 
S. D. Lee, . . . ' Pray that you may never see 
another Sharpsburg. Sharpsburg was Artillery 
HeU.' " And to illustrate the effect upon the 
Confederates of the sight of the great numbers 
of the Federals at Gettysburg, the following is 
told : " To this day there survive stories showing 
how the Confederates were impressed by this 
tremendous display. One, still told by guides 
at Gettysburg, is that a cry was heard in the 
Confederate ranks, ' Have we got all creation 
to whip ? ' And another of the time was that 
the Federal commander was heard to give his 
orders: '•Attention, Universe! Nations into 
line / By Kingdom ! — Right wheel. ^ " But 
not until the very last did the Confederates 
fully realize the great odds against them. The 
following quotation will illustrate conditions in 
the West as early as 1863 : 

" We were so deficient in horseshoes that on the 
advance to Knoxville we stripped the shoes and saved 
the nails from all dead horses, killing for the purpose 
all wounded and broken-down animals, both of our own 
and those left behind by the enemy. During the siege, 
the river brought down a number of dead animals 
thrown in within the town. Our men were nearly as 
badly off for foot gear as our animals. I have seen 
bloody stains left on frozen ground where our infantry 
had passed. In the artillery we took the shoes from 
the feet of the drivers to give to the cannoneers who 
had to march. Our rations were also frequently not 
even the reduced rations now issued to the whole army. 
Corn, imground, was often the only ration." 

In everything, except leaders and courage, 
the Federals were superior from the beginning : 
all along the Confederates had ammunition and 
guns inferior to the Federals' — before the Con- 
federates got rid of flintlocks the Federals had 
breech-loading magazine guns; the Federals also 
had war-balloons and engineer corps. Of the 
emptiness of the Confederate larder much less 
than usual is said, but it is amusing to note 
the appreciation exhibited even now by the 
dignified general when he writes of the captured 
Federal eatables at Manassas, or of that side 
of English bacon which he "borrowed" and 
carried on his saddle to Appomattox. 

Since General Alexander so frankly acknow- 
ledges that the political principles for which the

South contended ought to have been lost, it is 
interesting to have his opinion of just what 
good resulted from all the fighting, especially 
after there was no hope of independence. It 
is the usual ex-Confederate view, now coming 
to be somewhat better understood. 

" In every war there are two issues contended for. 
First, is the political principle involved; which with us 
was the right of secession. The second is prestige or 
character as a people. Conceding our cause, did we 
defend it worthily, history and posterity being the 
judges ? We lost the first issue ; and the more utterly 
it was lost, the better it has proved to be — for ourselves, 
even more than for our adversaries. Without detract- 
ing from their merit, but displaying and even enhancing 
it, we have gained the second by a courage and con- 
stancy which could only be fully developed and ex- 
hibited under the extreme tests endured, and by the 
high types of men who became our leaders. Is not 
that end worthy of the extreme price paid for it, even 
to the last drop of blood shed at Appomattox ? I am 
sure that to the army, any end but the last ditch would 
have seemed a breach of faith with the dead we had 
left upon every battlefield."

The Religions of Japan.* 

The series of " Lectures on the History of 
Religions " is on the whole an excellent one, 
although most of the volumes are by men who 
were imder the disadvantage of being widely 
separated from their subjects in race, distance, 
and time. This, however, is not the case with 
the sixth volume of the series, on " The De- 
velopment of Religion in Japan," by Dr. 
George William Knox of Union Theological 
Seminary. As Professor of Philosophy and 
Ethics in the Imperial University of Tokio, 
Dr. Knox lived long among the people of whose 
thought he treats, was familiar with their char- 
acter and records, and enjoyed scholarly asso- 
ciation with their learned men. Hence he was 
not, like the majority of the older writers on 
Japanese religions, liable to be misled by 
erroneous and obsolete data, nor to be carried 
away by the currents of subjective fancy. At 
every step he has sought to verify his examina- 
tions and conclusions by careful research and 
inquiry. 

Now that it is beyond dispute that the first 
" Japanese " were straight-eyed, full-bearded 
people who spoke an Aryan tongue, who later 
were conquered and absorbed by some Malay 
or Continental race (themselves afterwards 
mightily reinforced and civilized by people

from the neighboring mainland), we are not 
surprised to find that the three strata of re- 
ligions in Japan are, by name, Shinto, Bud- 
dhism, and Confucianism, — that is, natural or 
insular religion ; the great Aryan faith, which 
blended Hindoo and Mongol ideas ; and, finally, 
the Chinese system, which, first in its simpler 
form furnished rules of life, and then in its 
philosophical evolution gave a creed to the more 
cultured classes in Eastern Asia. Chronolog- 
ically, Shinto lived, grew, and finally suffered 
deglutition, in the eighth century, becoming for 
a thousand years a virtual Jonah in the Bud- 
dhist whale's belly. The "great fish" which 
contained this precious treasure is known in 
Japanese history as Riobu Shinto, — that is, 
Mixed Shinto. It certainly became the undo- 
ing, in modern times, of many a supposedly 
learned European who accepted the phenomena 
of a Buddhist dogmatic achievement for the 
real Way of the Gods. The English scholars, 
Satow, Aston, and Chamberlain, by their re- 
searches since 1870, have discredited the reports 
of Kempfer and his copyists. How lively, in 
1868, were the hacking by swords of the Bud- 
dhist deities in Tokio, that in the eyes of infur- 
iated patriots had so long defiled the idolless 
temples of the original Shinto ! How vigorous 
the purge, when the Riobu Shinto temples were 
changed from art museums to Quaker-like 
meeting-houses ! These were emptied of their 
Buddhistic emblems, including priceless works 
of art which were scattered throughout Europe. 
While the dispossessed shavelings gnashed their 
teeth, the full-haired Shinto shrine-keepers came 
into place and office. The escheated estates on 
which, for a millennium, Buddhist monks had 
fattened, dropped into the public treasury to 
furnish and equip a public school system. Thus 
by a stroke of politics the ecclesiastical fraud 
of a thousand years was rectified and pure 
Shinto came back to power. 

Dr. Knox, being a scholar and knowing these 
things, does not depend upon unre vised ency- 
clop£edias, or on the modem school of superficial 
writers on Japan, or on hostile critics of pagan 
faith. With the ease and poise of a trained 
scholar, he shows us that the development of 
religion 4n Japan was neither continuous nor 
by resident forces, and hence not by any of that 
kind of " evolution " which used to be dog- 
matically taught us. Japanese religion, like its 
civilization, was caused in great measure by 
contact with foreign peoples and civilizations. 
The early Japanese had no ancestor-worship, 
nor did they possess those Chinese institutions 



386

[June 1, 



which were afterward so liberally borrowed. 
As with other races, neither organized family 
life nor modern gentleness of demeanor are 
traceable in the records of their ancient days. 
Shinto is simply the religion of nature. The 
modern literary revival of Shinto, chiefly by a 
few scholars of the eighteenth century, has 
really nothing in common with the ancient life, 
except as we justify Chauvinism, or the degra- 
dation of religion into a political machine to 
secure national unity. 

When we leave the austere simplicity of 
Shinto in the Miya and pass into the Tera or 
Buddhist temple, we depart from a hut and 
enter a palace of art. Here we find architecture, 
painting, carving, music, incense — all that is 
known of external decoration in the Southern 
forms of Christianity and the Northern devel- 
opment of Buddhism. Properly speaking, 
Shinto has no sacred book or ethical code, while 
but to transport the Buddhist canons one would 
need a camel train or freight cars. No wonder 
they have never been translated into Japanese ! 
Dr. Knox well calls this Aryan religion " the 
worship of the Absolute." Buddhism in Japan 
heightened and broadened the emotions stimu- 
lated by Shinto. What an amazing revelation 
to the islanders was this Aryan religion ! Kobo, 
perhaps Japan's mightiest intellect, proclaimed 
the ancient gods of Nippon to be incarnations 
of Buddha. Then the Aryan faith entered upon 
a mighty missionary development. Once rooted 
in the whole Japanese empire, a new growth of 
doctrinal evolution burst forth. It would be 
hard indeed to say what phase of the human 
mind, as expressed in the processes of the Greek 
or Roman, or the reformed phases of Chris- 
tianity, is not to be matched in Japanese Bud- 
dhism. Disestablished in 1868, its leaders lost 
hope for a time ; but now Japanese Buddhism 
has adjusted itself to the new conditions. 

With the same masterly hand, Dr. Knox 
treats Confucianism, first as polity and ethics, 
and then as a world-system. We cannot go 
into the historical details presented, except to 
say that in China in the twelfth and in Japan 
in the seventeenth century Confucianism became 
a philosophical creed and the Chinese " new 
theology " under Chu Hi attempted a synthesis 
of all Asiatic thought. In its fresh form it 
became the religion of the learned, while Bud- 
dhism was left for the comfort of the ignorant 
and the lowly. 

To-day, in Japan, one group of young men 
would find the nation's future in a return to 
the worship of the Absolute ; while another and 



more influential group sets forth a glorified 
Bushido as the hope of salvation. Both schools 
recognize, however, that in the modem world 
the conditions do not obtain which made for 
those forms of religion in the past. A third 
group, holding to the best in the past, would 
combine it with the noblest truths of our modem 
science, philosophy, and religion. With Dr. 
Knox (after forty years' acquaintance with the 
Japanese mind and heart), we hold to the faith 
that these dreams are to be realized in some 
better form than is yet conceived. By her blood, 
her genius, her history, her ethnic inheritances, 
and her geographical situation, Japan is the one 
country in all the world best fitted to accom- 
plish the final synthesis of the world's religions.

Cat's-Cradle in Many Lands.* 



The familiar game of " cat's-cradle " has long 
interested ethnographers and folk-lore students. 
Travellers have been surprised to find children 
in China, in Corea, and in Japan making the 
identical strange figures with strings that they 
themselves knew when they were children. It 
has been a still greater surprise to find that 
many barbarous or even savage peoples, in 
widely separated regions, delight in making 
complicated figures with loops of string. Boas 
found the Eskimo in Baffinland doing so ; Roth 
figures a quantity of designs from Australian 
blacks ; Haddon foimd the practice wonderfully 
developed in New Guinea, and Dr. Furness 
encountered it among the Caroline Islanders ; 
Culin has studied it among various American 
Indians, and in Hawaii. In her great book on 
" String Figures," now before "us, Mrs. Jayne 
brings together the work of these and other 
students, and adds the results of her own dili- 
gent investigations. The book is a storehouse 
of the harvest so far gathered, and the source 
from which all further work and study in this 
field must proceed. It is not primarily and 
directly an ethnographic study. In the preface, 
the author states her purpose in writing the 
book to be two-fold — "to interest other stu- 
dents in the subject, in order that additional 
figures and their methods may be collected 
among various tribes and races ; and to reach 
a still larger public, that more people may share 
in the fascinations of the games themselves."

Really, it is the latter side of the study, the 
practical side, that Mrs. Jayne develops most 
fully. It is uot so much her purpose to make 
known the finished patterns produced by vari- 
ous peoples, as to enable all to reproduce them 
in the very way in which the natives produce 
them. It is true that Dr. Haddon, of Cam- 
bridge University, who has given much serious 
study to the subject, has written an Introduction 
to the work, in which he presents the ethnog- 
raphy of cat's-cradle, and that Mrs. Jayne her- 
self devotes a part of her first chapter to the 
same subject ; but the bidk of the book is 
strictly practical, devoted to illustrated direc- 
tions for making specific figures. 

As some of these figures are complex and are 
constructed only through a series of complicated 
and somewhat difficult movements, ten or fifteen 
stages being required at times, this description 
is by no means easy, and demands a special 
technical vocabulary. Dr. Haddon and Mr. 
Rivers some time ago proposed a method of 
recording the making of such figures, and de- 
veloped a scientific but difficult and repellant 
nomenclature. Mrs. Jayne, appealing to her 
larger public, simplifies both nomenclature and 
description, and becomes comprehensible to the 
average intelligent reader. Her illustrative 
cuts are clear, and are made from the point of 
sight of the person constructing the pattern. 
In each case, every stage in the development 
of the figure is illustrated. Thus, one who 
desires to do so may by a little care and atten- 
tion really construct the ninety-seven different 
patterns which are here described in detail 
and illustrated by upwards of eight hundred 
figures. 

Turning now to the subject itself, we find 
that string games may be roughly classed into 
" figures, whereof the purpose is to form final 
patterns^ supposed to represent definite objects ; 
those which are tricks^ wherein, after much 
complex manipulation of the strings, the entire 
loop is suddenly drawn from the hand by some 
simple movement ; and those which are catches, 
wherein, when certain strings are pulled, the 
hand or some of the fingers may be unexpect- 
edly caught in a running noose." Mrs. Jayne 
presents all the examples of these three classes 
— patterns, tricks, and catches — that she has 
found. 

A few weeks ago I would have assumed that 
every American was acquainted with the good 
old game of " cat's-cradle "; to-day I know 
better, but shall assume that most readers at 
least remember it. With a loop of string, by 



the use of both hands a figure is formed to 
which the name " cat's-cradle " is given. It is 
an attractive, rather simple, symmetrical pat- 
tern, which does not even remotely suggest 
either a cat or a cradle. In removing this from 
the two hands of the maker, a second player 
produces an entirely different design, which 
among us is usually nameless, but in some parts 
of Europe has a distinctive cognomen. The 
first player now removes this, producing a third 
pattern. Frequently the players can go no 
further, but experts may continue up to an 
eighth pattern, although the final designs may 
vary somewhat with different players. This 
game is known to exist in Great Britain, 
France, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Neth- 
erlands, Germany, Austria, and Spain ; it 
probably occurs in all other European countries. 
Mrs. Jayne calls the eight patterns "cradle," 
" soldier's bed," " candles," " manger," " dia- 
mond," " cat's eye," " fish in a dish," and 
" clock." These forms, so widely known in 
Europe, are also known and made in the same 
way in China, Japan, Corea, the Philippines, 
Borneo, and perhaps in Java, Celebes, and 
Australia. This series, with but a few patterns, 
requiring two players who alternately remove 
one pattern thereby producing a new one, is 
believed by Dr. Haddon to have originated in 
Asia and to have travelled from there, in rela- 
tively recent times, into Europe. He therefore 
calls it the " Asiatic type." 

More curious, more varied, more widely dis- 
tributed, is his " Oceanic type." Here usually 
one player works alone. Taking the string lood 
upon his hands, by various manipulations anp 
movements he produces a final (named) pattern. 
This ends his task. If he chooses, he may 
remove the string and proceed to the construc- 
tion, from the beginning, of another pattern, or 
still another. Sometimes not only the two hands 
but the mouth of the player, even his toes, feet, 
or legs, may be needed for the construction ; 
occasionally the help of another person's hands 
is needed. Figures of this Oceanic type are 
made in Australia, New Guinea, Melanesia and 
Polynesia, and by Eskimo and many North 
American Indian tribes. The designs are often 
striking and attractive, and their construction 
is complex. There is not a definite series of 
patterns, limited in number, found everywhere 
through this vast area, — but here some, there 
others, are found. The same final pattern may 
be produced in different ways ; but usually, in 
separated areas, the same method produces the 
same form. Some patterns have a wide distri- 



338

bution ; others, so far as now known, may be 
limited to a single people and a small district. 
Sometimes a story accompanies the making of 
a figure or succession of figures, when the dif- 
ferent patterns may be considered as the illus- 
trations of the tale. It is possible that at times 
religious associations connect themselves with 
the game. Careful comparative study of the 
patterns of the Oceanic type may yield inter- 
esting residts. 

Two patterns of the Oceanic type are found 
among Europeans. One of them was made 
for me recently by a student, under the name 
of " crow's-foot." Mrs. Jayne calls it " the 
leashing of Lochiel's dogs," and reports it from 
Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Algeria, 
and Australia, and says it is known to the 
Ulimgu of Africa and the Navajos and Chero- 
kees of North America. It has the widest 
known range of all string-patterns. " Tallow 
dips " is also a European pattern, made by one 
player, with no expectation of conversion to a 
new figure in removal by a second player. The 
temporary patterns made during its construc- 
tion have independent names, and a story is 
told which they illustrate. These two patterns — 
" crow's-foot " and " tallow dips " — curious in 
themselves and interesting in distribution and 
accompaniment, raise questions deserving fur- 
ther study. 

Mrs. Jayne presents two figures procured 
from Otabenga — the "pygmy" from the 
Kasai district — and refers to two or three other 
African patterns. Dr. Haddon states that few 
had been reported from the dark continent. 
Since Mrs. Jayne's book was published, three 
articles on African string-figures have appeared 
in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute. 
During my recent visit to the Congo Free State, 
I found two series, quite distinct. One of these 
was the regidar Oceanic type of which more than 
sixty patterns were encountered ; the other, quite 
unlike all yet reported, comprised at least fifty 
patterns. Details regarding both will be pub- 
lished presently. 

It will be seen that Mrs. Jayne's book is 
curiously interesting. It is issued in excellent 
form. Besides the many cuts illustrating the 
figures and their modes of construction, there 
are many full-page plates of natives making 
string-figures, or who have made such. Many 
of these are interesting, but not all. The 
frontispiece is pretty ; it not only has no raison 
d^ etre, but is out of place. A true " cat's- 
cradle picture " of white children would have 
been appropriate ; but a picture of a white 



child — no matter how pretty and " cute " — 
making barbarous " lightning " patterns is not 
the picture to form the frontispiece of such a

The History of Literary Censorship.* 



As the art of writing came into existence in 
very early times, it was invested with such a 
degree of mystery that it was viewed with super- 
stitious awe by the uninitiated, even as it is by 
primitive peoples at the present time upon their 
first coming into contact with it. The art was 
restricted to the sacerdotal classes, until the 
Phoenicians got hold of it and used it for com- 
mercial ends. Had it remained the monopoly 
of the priests or of any other class, it would 
have continued to be an instrument of enslave- 
ment instead of becoming one for the liberation 
of mind and thought. It was natural, however, 
that the classes who at first held a monopoly of 
the province of letters shoxdd be jealous of any 
intrusion upon their domain ; and their opposi- 
tion to such intrusion has opened up that long 
chapter in the history of literature known as 
Censorship. The ancient rulers, while recog- 
nizing books as capable of great benefit to 
society and to religion, also held them in sus- 
picion as powerfid means of spreading ideas 
subversive of religion and of political govern- 
ment. Augustus, who ordered the writings of 
Labienus publicly burned, is cited by Tacitus 
as the first ruler who undertook to punish the 
written or spoken word ; and his example was 
followed by his successors upon the imperial 
throne. The mind of the reader may go back 
to another and not altogether unrelated inci- 
dent, which occurred in the winter house of a 
King of Judah, when Jehudi cut and burned 
the book of the prophet Jeremiah because it 
contained prophecies against the king and his 
kingdom. 

Christianity, as it developed, endeavored to 
assume the supervision of literature so far as it 
was able. The Apostolic Constitutions forbade 
Christians to read any books of the Gentiles ; 
and a synod of Bishops in Asia Minor, about 
A. D. 150, condemned and prohibited the read- 
ing of the Acta Pauli. In the centuries follow- 
ing, a number of similar edicts or mandates were

published by councils, by individual ecclesiastics, 
or by civil officers acting under the influence 
of the Church, cautioning the faithful against 
certain literary productions, and threatening 
penalties ranging from confiscation of property 
to imprisonment, excommunication, and death. 
About the year 365, a canon of scripture was 
adopted by a provincial synod in Laodicaea, 
which was afterwards revised and adopted by a 
General Council. This action on the part of 
the Church was the exercise of a certain amount 
of discrimination in regard to other literatures, 
even though the other literatures might be 
Christian in character and thoroughly orthodox, 
and was of the nature of ecclesiastical censor- 
ship. The Church's supervision of literature 
was so far developed and organized in the time 
of Justinian that certain bishops were deposed 
for laxity of supervision of the literature circu- 
lated in their various sees. 

As the Roman Church developed into the 
ecclesiastical headship of the world, as a matter 
of course its claim as the legitimate successors 
of the imperial authority was asserted ; and as 
long as authors were for the most part of the 
clergy, and the universities were under the con- 
trol of the Church, the task of the ecclesiastical 
authorities in keeping a watch upon the litera- 
ture produced was comparatively easy, although 
Disraeli tells us that " the monks had a part 
of their libraries called the inferno^ which was 
not the part least visited, for it contained or 
hid all the prohibited books which could be 
smuggled into it." The invention of printing, 
however, while it was at first hailed by the 
ecclesiastical authorities as a means of spread- 
ing the pure gospel and the instruction of the 
Church, was soon discovered to be a two-edged 
sword, and more to be feared than courted ; and 
the task of censuring books calculated to do 
harm to the religion or the morals of the faith- 
ful was made a thousand times more difficult 
because of the fleetness of the wings provided by 
the printing-press for the thoughts of heretics. 

The Inquisition, dating from the Council of 
Toulouse in 1229, was reorganized in 1542, 
under a Bull of Paul III.; and in the following 
year the Inquisitor-General issued an edict for 
the suppression of heretical literature and of 
books written by heretics. This was followed by 
Papal bulls and Inquisitorial edicts extending 
into the seventeenth century. What is usually 
regarded as the first of the long series of Roman 
Indexes was compiled by the theological faculty 
of the University of Louvain, in 1546, under the 
authority of the famous buU Coena Domini 



issued just ten years previously. From this time 
on to the time of the Coimcil of Trent, the com- 
pilers of the Roman Indexes based their work 
upon Indexes which originated in Spain or the 
Netherlands. In 1559, being the time of Paul 
IV., the responsibility for the censorship of 
books was assumed by the Papal authority, and 
the first of a series of Papal Indexes was pub- 
lished under the title of Index Auctorum et 
Lihrorum Prohihitorum. Twelve years later, 
under Paul V., the Congregation of the Index 
was organized and the task of compiling the 
Index was committed to that body. The con- 
gregation still exists and carries on its work. 

In 1564 the Tridentine Index was published 
under the authority of Pope Pius IV. and the 
Council of Trent, and marked an epoch in the 
history of Censorship. Its list was more com- 
prehensive than any that had preceded it, and 
formed the basis of all subsequent Indexes. But 
its chief importance was in its formulation for 
the first time of definite censorship rules to be 
followed by future censors and compilers. And 
from that time on, the authority of the Papacy, 
acting through the Congregation of the Index, 
for retaining the general direction and control of 
Censorship, was generally recognized through- 
out the Catholic world, excepting in Spain, 
where the Inquisition held sway and was jealous 
of any interference with its powers. 

The Index of Benedict XIV., issued in 1758, 
marked a decided change in the policy of Cen- 
sorship, inasmuch as it was the last attempt 
made by the Papal authorities to maintain a 
general censorship of the world's literature. 
The compilers of later Indexes, down to the 
latest (1900), have contented themselves with 
repeating the general rules or principles by 
which the faithful are to be governed ; while 
the lists are limited almost exclusively to works 
of a doctrinal character, the teachings of which 
are found to be in one respect or another open 
to condemnation. The number of books abso- 
lutely prohibited becomes smaller, the greater 
number of books cited being placed upon the 
list of lihros expurgandos^ the readmg of which 
was forbidden only until certain corrections or 
eliminations had been made ; and there was no 
attempt to condemn (except under general rules 
and principles) the increasing number of Pro- 
testant books. 

There are, therefore, in the history of the 
Indexes, three periods of interest and import- 
ance. In the first (from 1559 and the Index 
Auctorum et Lihrorum down to the final ap- 
pendices to the Tridentine Index) almost the

only subject-matters considered were the great 
questions raised by the Reformation. In the 
second period, extending to the Index of Bene- 
dict XIV. (1758), the character of the works 
placed on the lists indicated questions of doctrine, 
opinion, and conduct, arising within the Church, 
the condemned writers being for the most part 
ecclesiastics. The third is the modern period 
in which censorship of literature has taken the 
form of statements of general principles to be 
followed, rather than that of lists of condemned 
books ; and the attempt to characterize the mass 
of the world's literature has been abandoned. 

In his " History of Literary Censorship " as 
revealed in the Prohibitory and Expurgatory 
Indexes, Dr. George Haven Putnam has found 
a large field for his scholarly investigation, and 
one that bears a close relation to that in which 
he has previously delved in his works on " Au- 
thors and their Public in Ancient Times " and 
" Books and their Makers during the Middle 
Ages." A history of literature that does not 
give due consideration to the subject of Censor- 
ship and its influence upon the production and 
the distribution of books is incomplete ; and Dr. 
Putnam's exhaustive treatise, in two volumes 
aggregating between eight and nine hundred 
pages, leaves little to be desired by the student 
of the subject. From his long established posi- 
tion in the world of books, it is but natural that 
the author should be most attracted to that 
phase of his subject which has to do with the 
distribution of literature ; but this phase is pur- 
sued without neglect of the others. The arrange- 
ment of material according to the cyclopaedic 
method, with the expectation that the work will 
be chiefly used for purposes of reference, has 
necessitated considerable repetition, for which 
the author apologizes in his preface. It may 
be remarked in passing, however, that the value 
of the work as a book of reference might have 
been enhanced by the provision of a more com- 
plete general index. 

The results of the author's investigations of 
the influence of censorship on the undertakings 
of authors, publishers, and booksellers, in the 
several European states, could not be adequately 
summarized here. The effect of the censorship 
was not everywhere the same. For the Papal 
Indexes, while in form binding on the entire 
Church and throughout all the states classed as 
Catholic, were actually in force in the several 
states only when accepted and confirmed by the 
respective rulers ; and a number of them were 
never so accepted in France or in Spain. In 
the former country, censorship was carried on 



by commissions of ecclesiastics acting under the 
direct authority of the crown ; while in Spain 
the Inqiiisition carried on an independent sys- 
tem of literary censorship and repression, and 
lists of books condemned by the Spanish In- 
quisitors do not accord with those of Rome. In 
some countries where the prohibitory indexes 
were ineffectual, great publishing houses grew 
up, as in the case of Elzevir in Ley den. 

In Mr. Putnam's work we find not only the 
most complete schedule of the Prohibitory and 
Expurgatory Indexes that has yet been compiled, 
but also a detailed account of most of them. 
There are many interesting instances in which 
the history of authorship and publishing comes 
in close touch with general history. Such, for 
example, was in connection with the Index of 
Pope Clement VIII. (1596), and the Concordat 
agreed upon between the Pope and the Venetian 
Senate in regard thereto. For a century and a 
half, under the Concordat, the Venetian Repub- 
lic persistently refused to authorize the publi- 
cation within its territory of any augmentation 
of the Clementine Index. It was while this 
prolonged struggle was in its acute stages that 
Fra Paola Sarpi came into prominence, and 
Paul the Friar prevailed against Paul the Pope 
in the contest for the maintenance of the liber- 
ties of the press in Venice. 

Dr. Putnam considers the Thirty Years' War 
in Germany (1618-1648) an extreme applica- 
tion of the principle of Censorship. " The 
power of the Emperor, and that of the Catholic 
princes who associated themselves with him, was 
directed to the suppression of Protestantism in 
Germany, and with this, to the control, under 
the direction of the Roman Church, of German 
thought and of German intellectual develop- 
ment. . . . And the control and restrictions of 
the operations of the printers constituted an 
essential part of the purpose of the Pope, the 
Emperor, and their allies, the Jesuits and 
Dominicans." The long trial of Galileo by the 
Inquisition, during the first half of the seven- 
teenth century, resulted in the presentation of 
his condemnation in the Index of 1664 ; and it 
was not until 1835 that the names of Galileo, 
Copernicus, and Keplar were finally omitted 
from the Index. 

The Index lists, as Dr. Putnam points out, 
are marvels of bibliographical inaccuracy, and 
present some amusing reading. To select at 
random some of these curiosities of literature : 
One Index enters " Franc Baconus " and 
" Franc Verulam '" as two distinct authors, and 
not until nearly a century later does the ftdl

name, Baron Verulam, appear. The name of 
Anne Askew is entered as " Anne a Skene " in 
the Index of 1590, and in the Index of 1597 as 
" A. S. Keuue." 

In conclusion it should be said that Dr. 
Putnam has pursued his investigations in a 
wholly impartial spirit. In his final chapter he 
presents a summary of the opinions formed in 
regard to the present literary policy of the 
Church of Rome by certain representative 
persons within that fold ; and everywhere he 
evinces a spirit of fairness which cannot fail to 
commend itself to the intelligent adherents of 
that faith. Arthur Howard Noll. 



The Catechism up to Date.* 



There is an old saying that " Except ye 
become as little children, ye shall in nowise 
enter the Kingdom of Heaven.'''' The teaching 
of Sir Oliver Lodge would seem to indicate, 
contrariwise, that " Except little children he- 
come as elderly philosophers, they shall in 
nowise," etc. In his preface to the new cate- 
chism, he justly observes that all who have to 
do with children must feel the difficulty of 
" instructing them in the details of religious 
faith, without leaving them open to the assaults 
of doubt hereafter, when they encounter the 
results of scientific enquiry." They must 
indeed ; but exactly the same is true of any 
instruction whatsoever. Can I so instruct my 
students in the details of the Darwinian faith 
that they wiU be immune to the assaults of all 
subsequent investigators ? The very thought is 
enough to make Darwin turn in his grave. Sir 
Oliver Lodge is justly esteemed as an eminent 
physicist, and one who has not been in the least 
immune to the " results of scientific enquiry." 
Why, then, should he desire in the religious 
field that which he would be the first to depre- 
cate in the scientific ? 

Presumably he would say, if confronted with 
the above, that it was not quite fair, — that if 
one would caref uUy read his book he would find 
it fuU of imcertainties, questions, and doubts, 
of indications of the imperfections of our knowl- 
edge and of references to the better light to be 
expected in later days. All this is true ; and 
yet the formulation of a catechism or creed is 
against the spirit of science, and as formulated 
it seems to me of doubtful value to young or 
old. Even if the fact had not been so boldly 

• The Substance op Faith Allied with Science. By Sir 
Oliver Lodge. New York: HarDer & Brothers. 



stated at the outset, it is an attempt to bind 
the mind, to produce a body of dogma which 
will resist free thought in later years. To most 
people, religious or irreligious, a period of men- 
tal ossification comes at last ; but Heaven pre- 
serve us from proposals to make the young 
prematurely old, and thereby, according to a 
respectable authority, less eligible to the King- 
dom ! 

Probably this sad result would not readily 
come about, from the fact that most of the 
catechism would fall as on deaf ears. The 
music of the following would probably be less 
audible to the young than that of the spheres, 
and certainly no more pleasing : 

" What caused and what maintains existence ? Of 
our own knowledge we are unable to realize the mean- 
ing of origination or of maintenance ; all that we our- 
selves can accomplish in the physical world is to move 
things into desired positions, and leave them to act on 
each other. Nevertheless, our effective movements are 
all inspired by thought, and so we conceive that there 
must be some intelligence immanent in all the processes 
of nature, for they are not random or purposeless, but 
organized and beautiful." 

Incidentally it may be remarked, that while 
the words random and purposeless have no 
meaning in a monistic philosophy, they do rep- 
resent empirical realities, which are part of the 
processes of nature. It is absurd to infer any- 
thing because the universe is not what it could 
not be according to the fundamental postulate ; 
actually, no positive or negative statement can 
be made about the totality of things, the " pro- 
cesses of nature " as a whole. Again, our 
author says : 

" Is man helped in his struggle upward ? There is 
a Power in the Universe vastly beyond our compre- 
hension; and we trust and believe that it is a Good 
alid Loving Power, able and willing to help us and all 
creatures, and to guide us wisely, without detriment to 
our incipient freedom," etc. 

We are inclined to prefer the frank paganism 
of the Old Testament, and the persuasive ethics 
of Jesus — so rich in human imagery, so elo- 
quent of the " Ahness of Things," as Lafcadio 
Hearn called it. 

While protesting against the Catechism — 
and the tide of our protest has risen higher 
every time we have returned to the book — we 
must recognize the fundamental excellence of 
its author's general aim, and the probability — 
indeed, certainty — that he will accomplish 
much good by his crusade against the more un- 
scientific elements of current religious dogma. 
We cannot fail to sympathize heartily with his 
desire that in the destruction of the ancient 
forms of religion the thing itself may not be

destroyed. We can hardly doubt that even 
his Catechism, when preached by himself, is 
interesting and profitable ; but we venture to 
suggest that if he seems to find it practically a 
source of inspiration, that is because any man 
so combining learning and good-will is worth 
listening to, whatever his topic.

The Spanish Discovery of America.* 

Mr. Filson Young's account of " Christopher 
Columbus and the New World of his Discov- 
ery " is — as is frankly announced in its preface 
and clearly betrayed in its pages — mainly 
popular in character. Yet it is well worth our 
careful consideration. The writer makes no 
pretense at original research, and much of the 
matter in the two interesting volumes is a mere 
adaptation (often careless in small particulars) 
of early narratives, especially of such as are 
given in Thacher's work on Columbus. Indeed, 
Mr. Young's indebtedness to Thacher is every- 
where apparent, even in the peculiar wording 
of a chapter heading ; but, in the arrangement 
of material, he has greatly improved upon that 
author's voluminous and heterogeneous work. 
For instance, after giving us an original de- 
scription of the birth-place, antecedents, and 
life of Columbus, down to the time of the 
equipment of the expedition of 1492, he has 
followed the course of each successive expedi- 
tion ; but, instead of introducing all the extant 
documents bearing upon the same event, he has 
collated them, or, perhaps more frequently, has 
taken some one of them — say an epitome of a 
lost journal, a letter like that of Dr. Chanca, 
or an independent account like that of Porras — 
and has used it almost in its entirety. The 
result is, not a confused mass of original sources 
put in for purposes of minute comparison, but 
a sustained narrative that never flags in interest. 

In one respect only can an exception be taken 
to the general commendation implied in the 
preceding paragraph. Mr. Young's arrange- 
ment of material is often faulty, and decidedly 
so in the matter of the Earl of Dunraven's 
note. This note applies to the first voyage, and 
is technically of inestimable value ; but it prop- 
erly belongs, not to the body of the text (unless, 
indeed, it take the place of several pages that

covery. By Filson Young. With a Note on the Navigation of

Lippincott Co. 



Mr. Young himself has written, and which it 
might weU do since the two accounts duplicate 
all secondary ideas) but to the Appendix. Placed 
as it is near the end of the second volume, and 
yet not within the Appendix where it would be 
convenient for enumeration, its presence is 
likely to be overlooked and its very great im- 
portance minimized. 

The early part of Mr. Young's work (the 
summary of biographical data) has been referred 
to as an original description ; but it is hardly 
that, or at least it is so only in the matter of 
rhetorical form, since it is in the main an almost 
wholesale adoption of Vignaud's theories and 
conclusions. In point of fact, Mr. Young's 
absolute dependence upon this indefatigable 
scholar is very evident, and never more so, 
presumably, than in the case of his reflections 
upon the character of Columbus. Those reflec- 
tions — and they are numerous, and a trifle 
light in tone — are nothing more or less than 
an expansion of Vignaud's letter to Mr. White- 
law Reid. 

For Harrisse, for Major, and for Winsor, 
Mr. Young manifests a great respect ; but he 
is unjustly critical of Washington Irving. 
Note, for example, his contemptuous allusion 
to Irving's work, an allusion that will un- 
doubtedly arouse a certain resentment in many 
a reader's mind. Irving wrote at a time when 
the modern method of historical criticism was 
still in its infancy, yet he conformed to its 
principles as far as his professional knowledge 
extended and his opportunities allowed. More- 
over, his attitude toward this particular work 
was certainly that of the honest investigator ; 
and, although since his day specialists have 
pronounced his characterizations of the great 
Admiral to be more or less ideal, and have 
lowered the personal estimate, corrected statis- 
tics, and added many new facts to our 
knowledge of the incidents of the discovery, 
nevertheless the biography of Columbus that so 
charmed the readers of the middle nineteenth 
century is admittedly the most famous that has 
ever appeared, and is still one of the best. At 
all events, there is nothing in it that can be 
stigmatized as " profoimdly dull." Irving 
never descended to mere twaddle, and never 
found it necessary, in order to make his hero 
live again, to be suggestively coarse, disgust- 
ingly flippant, or ridiculously common. He 
was always the man of exquisite literary taste, 
of refined and gentlemanly instincts. 

Here let us consider the one great and glar- 
ing defect of Mr. Young's work. It lies in the

spirit of levity that more or less pervades it. 
Advances in knowledge that have cost years of 
exhausting labor are made light of ; and this 
the real student of history, himself serious of 
purpose and earnest in endeavor, can scarcely 
be expected to forgive. He may admire the 
writer's easy flow of language, his vast fund of 
information, and the structural perfection of 
his work ; but he will never be convinced that 
it is necessary to be frivolous in order to be 
interesting. He may realize that his own abili- 
ties, controlled as they perforce must be by the 
destructive tendencies of the age, are inadequate 
for popularized construction ; yet he will shrink 
from having noble truths placed in a trivial set- 
ting. The incongruity will be too much for 
his magnanimity, and incline him impatiently to 
ignore redeeming qualities and forget that the 
world has waited long for an accurate account 
of the Spanish discovery of America, and that 
Mr. Young's production is pioneer in its nature, 
somewhat lacking in dignity no doubt, but none 
the less admirable, ^^^a Heloise Abel. 



Briefs on New Books. 



Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson has 

te^BeZZtt ^^d^^« pleasantly familiar with 
what is now known as the Benson 
book, a book written ostensibly by a bachelor, or 
perhaps by a widower — preferably of delicate 
constitution — who rides a bicycle and has a store 
of beautifid thoughts and high ideals that press for 
utterance, although the utterer (who writes in the 
first person and usually signs only his initials) pro- 
fesses a noble indifference whether his writings 
shall ever be published, since he writes merely be- 
cause it is a necessity of his natiu'e, like breathing. 
" The Letters of One : A Study in Limitations ; by 
Charles Hare Plunkett " ( Putnam ) bears the un- 
mistakable Benson stamp, in conception and execu- 
tion. A poor bachelor of fine literary taste and 
slender achievement is in love, or thinks he is, with 
a rich and refined woman a little older than he, 
who would marry him if he could bring himself to 
exchange an ideally beautiful relation for a practi- 
cally useful one. But his dreamy, artistic tempera- 
ment recoUs at the thought of close and constant 
intimacy with his beloved ; and his letters to her, 
which compose the book, refine upon and attempt 
to explain the curious fact that just because he 
loves her and wishes always to love her he cannot 
ask her to marry him. Through five long months 
and something like 170 pages of print this uncom- 
fortable and ineffectual person makes love in his 
anaemic fashion — a sort of negative courtship — 
until the lady, evidently a woman of some sound 



common sense and a saving remnant of self-respect, 
wearies of the Platonic trifling, and the letters 
abruptly cease. Much space is given to talk about 
literature as a jealous mistress to whom the letter- 
writer has dedicated himself, and who will brook 
no rival. He speaks of himself as intensely pre- 
occupied with his work, and adds : " If you knew 
how haunted I am by cadences, phrases, words, 
the colour of language, methods of expression, you 
would think I had no time for anything else." Yet 
he carelessly uses the superlative degree of com- 
parison where the merest rudiments of grammar 
call for the comparative, and twice writes " if one 
was," instead of " if one were," to denote a sup- 
position contrary to fact. But perhaps his emotional 
disorder had unbalanced his grammatical judgment. 
As a tmir de force in the portrayal of love-madness 
at the summit of its absurdity, the little book is a 
sort of curiosity. The author, be he Mr. Benson 
or a close imitator of his manner, has the cleverness 
of a practised writer of introspective habits. Such 
love as he depicts, if one may call it love, is not 
impossible to the fastidiously artistic temperament ; 
but is its minute and prolonged inspection worth 
ovu' while? It is a little curious, finally, that this 
book and " Beside Still Waters " (of acknowledged 
Bensonian authorship), both issued simultaneously 
by the same publishing house, have each a reference 
to the odor of syringa blossoms as associated with 
a memorable event in early life ; each, too, has an 
apt allusion to " Thi'ough the Looking-Glass "; and 
each pictures that fastidiousness of the sensitive 
artistic temperament that makes, or seems to make, 
wedded happiness impossible. These small coin- 
cidences, taken in connection with the striking like- 
ness of style, establish almost beyond a doubt the 
identity of authorship. 

Modern colonial government has no 
u'^lalava uiore instructive chapter in its his- 

tory than the story of the evolution 
of British administration in the Malay states. 
Previous to 1874 the various Malay states were in 
continual warfare with one another. Quarrels and 
feuds, revolution and lawlessness, marked the ordi- 
nary course of affairs. In 1874 the native chiefs 
of Perak, admitting their inability to cope with 
these difficulties, made a treaty at Pangkor, and 
asked for a British resident official "whose advice 
must be asked and acted upon in all cases other 
than those touching Malay religion and custom." 
A short time after this treaty the other Malay states 
made similar agreements with the British govern- 
ment. Another step in the evolution was made in 
1895, when the states of Perak, Selangor, Pahang, 
and Negri Sambilan agreed to a treaty of federa- 
tion, and formed what is now known as the Fede- 
rated Malay States. Under this system the various 
British resident officials of the several states are 
responsible to a resident-general, who in turn is 
responsible to the governor of the Straits Settle- 
ments, the British High Commissioner. Such an 



344 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



evolution in colonial administration, among such 
people as the Malays, marks a distinct feature in 
British government. To tell the story of this evolu- 
tion truthfully and judiciously requires a level head 
and an intimate knowledge of the Malay people, 
their customs, and their peculiar psychology. More- 
over, whoever attempts to tell the story should he 
close to the centre of the system of administration. 
All these conditions are amply and happily fulfilled 
by Sir Frank Swettenham, late Governor of the 
Straits Settlements and High Commissioner for the 
Federated Malay States. Sir Frank went out to 
the Malays in 1874, and has therefore seen the 
evolution of the government in Malay almost from 
its very beginning. To give a sufficient background 
for his able discussion of the development of British 
paternalism in the Malay states, the author deals 
with the early histoiy of Malacca, and of those 
Settlements forming the British colony of which the 
capital is Singapore. Only one chapter is given to 
the Malay : his customs, prejudices, arts, language, 
and literature. The rest of the volume is devoted 
to the political history we have outlined. As a 
study in colonial government it is characterized by 
a just balance : the author is proud of the efforts of 
England in those states, yet he holds his enthusiasm 
in check by his sound political judgment. His 
volume, which is entitled " British Malaya " (John 
Lane Co.), may well rank as a masterpiece among 
the host of similar books written by the servants of 
the British Government. 



Professor Henry Cecil Wyld's " His- 

yinS. *"^'^^^ ^*^"^y ^* *^^ Mother Tongue " 

(Dutton) is a book such as has long 
been needed by teachers both in Great Britain and 
in America. There are already several good ele- 
mentary manuals of the history of English with 
which teachers can manage to get on very well ; 
but between the study of these books and that of the 
difficult monographs which the advanced student 
must attack there has hitherto been an unbridged 
gap. We know of none of the younger English 
scholars better qualified to write such a book than 
Mr. Wyld, already well known for his investiga- 
tions in the palatalization of consonants. An enthu- 
siastic disciple of Sweet, he has had admirable train- 
ing, of which every page of the book gives evidence. 
The first eight chapters deal with such general sub- 
jects as the aims of linguistic study, sounds and 
their changes, how speech is acquired and trans- 
mitted, the working of analogy in language. Con- 
stantly the fact is emphasized that language is a 
living organism and that language processes of the 
remote past do not differ essentially from those 
which may be found in existence to-day. Then 
follow chapters on the Aryan mother-tongue and the 
Germanic family ; and the student is now ready for 
the five remaining chapters on English. The treat- 
ment of sound-changes in Old, Middle, and Modern 
English is amply illustrated and, so far as we have 
observed, wholly clear. The problems of early 



modern pronimciation are treated with unusual 
fulness. The concluding chapter, on "The Study 
of Present-day English," ought to be read and 
digested by everyone who is interested in encour- 
agii^g good habits of speech, and especially by those 
persons who, with all good intentions, have helped 
give birth to that curious species known as " school- 
ma'am English." Mr. Wyld rightly insists upon a 
careful distinction between written or literary and 
standard spoken English. Two or three notes fol- 
low : p. 64, 1. 2, American usage would prefer 
were ; pp. 65, 411, read Logeitrmn; p. 74, 1. 21, we 
have never heard in America this pronunciation of

to Wheeler's " Analogy and the Scope of its Appli- 
cation in Language," Ithaca, N. Y., 1887 ; p. 222,

inary portrait. Benson's "Beside Still Waters"

inary, since one feels that the author is giving gen- 
erously of his own deepest experiences and inmost 
convictions, in the form of reflections on questions 
of religion, education, literature, art, music, and 
philosophy. In mere externals, too, the life of 
" Hugh Neville " and that of his creator largely 
coincide, even to points of detail. Both are sons of 
a high church dignitary, both pass from public school 
to Cambridge, thence to a post of not wholly con- 
genial routine work, and finally back to Cambridge, 
to a fellowship and a literary life. Middle age 
(the author's age) is depicted as the most desirable 
period of life, with prospects of increasing richness 
of experience and ripeness of powers as the years 
accumulate. But in the lives of both Hugh and his 
biographer the reader is vaguely conscious of a cer- 
tain hardness and bareness, the result of excessive 
self-concentration : the celibate literary life, how- 
ever full of high ideals and artistic enthusiasms, is 
not after all made to appear the most attractive sort 
of existence. Roundness and fulness, tenderness 
and warmth, are certainly lacking to it. The sacred 
authority of the inner voice is well insisted on, but 
with an iteration that tends at last to breed a little 
distrust of its infallibility. Hugh Neville is an ardent 
seeker for and interpreter of the beautiful and the 
true as he sees them — that is, as the author sees 
them. The detachment of the creative artist is 
not Mr. Benson's: a delightful essayist of carefully 
reasoned ethical and literary convictions he is and 
will remain. As was to be expected, the style and 
finish of his book are exquisite, despite a few mis- 
prints, and one closes the volume with a sense of 
having enjoyed a rare treat. A mild surprise, how- 
ever, is felt at finding so correct a writer sanctioning 
the current questionable use of " fierce." Refer- 
ence is made to the notion entertained by some

negro leader. q^ ^^e title-page of Mr. Booker T. 
Washington's volume on Frederick Douglass in 
the " American Crisis Biographies," published by 
George W. Jacobs &, Co. The story of the slave 
who rose to be the Moses to lead his race out of 
bondage is very appropriately told by that other 
slave boy who has risen to be the Joshua who is 
leading the race into the promised land of real 
independence through practical education and in- 
telligent labor. And the story is well told, with 
enthusiasm and admiration of the hero, but with 
self-repression, dignity, and a high degree of ability 
as a biographer. In this book Mr. Washington has 
shown that he can write well on other subjects than 
the education of the negro. In the portrayal of the 
character of Douglass and of others who come into 
the story, in the description of the many striking 
scenes and of the development of the remarkable 
life of the great negro agitator, orator, and race- 
leader, in the history of slavery in America and of 
the movements for its abolition north and south, 
and in the judgments of public men on both sides 
of the slavery question, we see insight, breadth of 
view, and excellent power of discrimination as well 
as of literary expression. The book is interesting 
as a general treatment of the slavery question and 
as the biography of a man of power, and it is of 
permanent value as an account of the Abolition 
movement from the point of view of a member of 
the negro race. The general chapters on " The 
Genesis of the Anti-Slavery Agitation," " The Fugi- 
tive Slave Law," " The Underground Railway," 
" The Enlistment of Colored Troops," " Reconstruc- 
tion," and other topics of a similar nature, have been 
introduced to bring the work within the plan and pur- 
pose of the series of which it forms a worthy part. 

Amona the Miss Elise Whitlock Rose's work 

"southern "^ entitled " Cathedrals and Cloisters of 
France. the South of France " (Putnam) is 

a careful and conscientious study, in two volumes, 
of the ecclesiastical architecture of Provence, Lan- 
guedoc, and Gascony, with some account of the 
historical conditions that gave it birth and develop- 
ment. The text is fully and finely illustrated from 
photographs made expressly for the purpose by 
Miss Vida Hunt Francis. Much of the territory 
that the artist and author have explored together 
is quite off the track of the ordinary tourist, and a 
complete guide in English to its architectural interests 
probably does not exist, whereas the authoritative 
French works are either very long or very technical. 
Miss Rose explains that in studying the cathedrals 



of the South one must immediately abandon the 
popular ideals of size, majesty, and architectural 
importance. In the South the cathedral is simply 
the bishop's church, sometimes large and imposing, 
— in which case it is generally modern and ugly, — 
but much oftener small, modest, badly restored, 
half ruined, or inartistically complicated in design 
by the warring ideas of many* builders. But if the 
architecture is seldom interesting except in frag- 
ments or from the point of view of a painstaking 
student of transition periods, the romantic legends, 
curious traditions, and often no less curious history 
of the Southern cathedrals go far to offset the bad 
taste of their builders, and consequently to lighten 
and diversify Miss Rose's study. She writes im- 
personally but informally, employs few technicalities, 
and describes and criticises in a general way rather 
than in detail. Her method is neither so terse nor 
so orderly as the traveller, with less ample leisure 
than her own, may wish. For the stay-at-home 
reader also these volumes will prove somewhat too 
diffuse to hold his interest, although the unusual 
beauty of the illustrations will do a great deal 
towards keeping him in touch with the text. 

The wisdom ^" thirteen short, crisp chapters of 
of a modern conversational give and_ take, Mrs. 
J^neria. Wilson Woodrow makes us acquaint- 

ed with Egeria, the Judge, the Poet, Castilia, the 
Bishop, the Financier, the Editor, and the Common- 
place Man. " The Bird of Time : being Conversa- 
tions with Egeria" (McClure, Phillips & Co.) is 
the title of the book in which these characters have 
their exits and their entrances. Egeria, clever and 
intellectual, of course, like her namesake of old, 
says more good things than anyone else in the 
book. Comforting to men as well as women is this 
dictum of hers : " There need be no long, cold 
winter. There is no longer, thank goodness ! any 
definite line marking the boundary between youth 
and old age. Why, the woman who to-day is cele- 
brated for distinctive charm and beauty, ripe views, 
disciplined intellect, cultivated and manifold gifts, 
would, forty years ago, have been relegated to the 
heavy ranks of the dowagers and grandmothers ; 
forced by the stern conventions of prevailing opin- 
ion to retire from the game just as she had gained 
a mastery of the rules." Frequent and apt are 
Egeria's quotations, but once she goes a little astray 
in trying to cite Pascal's famous saying as to what 
would have happened had Cleopatra's nose been 
shorter ; she makes the subsequent history of the 
world turn on the presence or absence of a front 
tooth in the seductive Egyptian's mouth. At the end 
of the book, after Castilia has married the Judge, 
Egeria, with no lack of admirers to choose from, 
gives her hand to — whom does the reader guess ? 
Of the six men named above, the very last the 
brilliant woman would have been expected to choose. 
But he had loved her more years than he could 
count, and he alone knew the secret of her age — 
that she was fifty.

A handbook 
of etching 
and engraving. 



The English translation of Dr. Fr. 
Lippmann's "Engraving and Etch- 
ing" (imported by Scribner) should 
be welcomed by all who are interested in the sub- 
jects of which it treats. Though the literature of 
engraving is very abundant, there is no other work 
in English that so thorouglily covers the ground 
traversed by this excellent handbook. The history 
of the art is traced from the beginning in the mid- 
dle of the fifteenth century to the opening years of 
the nineteenth. All the engi-avers of note and many 
of the minor men are dealt with, and the character- 
istics of their work set forth with admirable clearness, 
the letter-press being supplemented by numerous 
illustrations which are wisely made of the exact 
size of the originals — though in many instances 
this necessitated the reproduction of a detail instead 
of the entire print. The author, who was the keeper 
of the print room in the Royal Museum, Berlin, had 
unsurpassed opportunities for thorough and minute 
study. That he made good use of these the wealth 
of information packed into this volume bears wit- 
ness. Its compactness is not the least of its merits. 
The chapter on the technique of engraving tells in 
a few words just the things every collector needs to 
understand. The collector, it is true, will not find 
in it all he may wish to know, — as for instance, lists 
of the authentic works of any of the engi-avers ; but 
the inclusion of such matter would be far beyond 
the compass of a handbook. This edition has been 
carefully revised by Dr. Max Lehrs, Dr. Lippmann's 
successor in the print room of the Berlin Museum. 
The translation, by Mr. Martin Hardie of the 
Victoria and Albert Museum in London, is all that 
could be desired. 



Musings, 

tnostly 

mystical. 



Suggestiveness is the most valuable 
quality of M. Maeterlinck's essays 
on all sorts of subjects. He widens 
wonderfully the mental horizon of his readers. 
"The Measure of the Hours" (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.), named from the opening chapter on time- 
measuring devices, is his latest volume of collected 
pieces, all of them admirably translated, so far as 
one may judge without comparing the French, by 
Mr. Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, and many of 
them offering something novel and worthy of more 
than a moment's pondering. His tentative theory 
that life after death may mean an exchange of 
mortal powers for a new kind of consciousness, a 
sort of sixth sense whereof we can no more form 
a conception at present than a man born blind can 
conceive of color, is well presented, but of course 
not new. James Hinton, to name no others, has 
somewhere elaborated an ingenious argument to the 
same effect. The one literary essay in the collec- 
tion, that on " King Lear," attributes the preemi- 
nence of this tragedy to the fact that the madness 
of the aged king enables him, in his very human 
and appealing distress, to be grandly lyrical and 
passionate without running into bombast. The 
chapter on intelligence in plants will please the 



sentimental school of naturalists, but to the strictly 
scientific it will be foolishness. The essays on our 
social duty and our anxious morality, themes of 
practical import surely, are not exactly remarkable 
for poise and precision. On the other hand, the 
remarks '' In Praise of the Fist " are unexpectedly 
good and to the point. 

Brtmetih-e '^^® Sense of loss SO widely felt at 

on Balzac's the death of Ferdinand Bruneti^re 

art and work. ig^g^. autumn is revived by the recent 
publication of his volume on Balzac in the "French 
Men of Letters" series (Lippincott). Even reserved 
admirers of Balzac will easily concur with Brunetiere 
in placing the great novelist with Sainte-Beuve, 
Hugo, Comte, and two or three savants, as the 
writers who have exerted the greatest influence upon 
nineteenth-century France. They may also agree 
that his work formed a point of departure for the 
modem novel. But this great critic goes further: 
" Balzac is the novel," he tells us ; his power of 
drawing genre pictures makes his novels of tremen- 
dous historical and social value; he gives, for the 
first time, an exact representation of life, and treat- 
ing life thus faithfully he evades the stigma of 
" immorality "; he '' created " the novel-form, trans- 
formed the drama, and even changed the manners 
and customs of life. Brunetifere insists that in 
judging Balzac one should consider his work in its 
entirety — the Human Comedy as a whole. His 
originality lay in his universal conception of life 
coupled with his realism. Balzac's art, for this 
very reason, comprised no power of selection, and 
was in no way self-conscious ; he wrote without any 
theory of art, since the mere representation of life 
was his aim. Brunetifere's entire treatment of his 
subject, being a study of Balzac's work and in no 
sense a biography, tends to stimulate investigation 
and discussion, and can hardly be disregarded in 
any study of Balzac's literary art. 



A volume of 
Whistleriana 



The volume entitled " Whistler : 
Notes and Footnotes and other 
Memoranda," in which Mr. Albert 
E. Gallatin has reprinted some fifteen reviews and 
other fugitive articles contributed to various period- 
icals, is made notable by the inclusion of reproduc- 
tions of two hitherto unpublished drawings by 
Whistler in the author's possession, and of one 
of his drawings for the catalogue of Sir Henry 
Thompson's collection of " Blue and White." The 
charming water-color, " Symphony in Gray — the 
Thames at Dusk," that forms the frontispiece to 
the book, is excellently reproduced and will be of 
interest to admirers of the master's work. It is a 
pity that the size of the original is not stated. The 
"Studies of Poppies" (sic) done in pastel, has 
not come out so well ; the grain of the half-tone 
block is rather painfully in evidence and results 
in an effect too mechanical to be satisfactory. Of 
the other plates in the volume, the grotesques 
by Leonardo da Vinci, from the originals in the 



1907.]

Academy in Venice, are worthy of mention. The 
book is handsomely printed on hand-made paper, 
and in nearly all the details of fine book-making is 
impeccable. Mr. Gallatin's notes are thoughtful 
and suggestive, and have the merit of brevity. 
The sale of the book in England is reported to 
have been enjoined by Mr. Whistler's executrix, a 
basis for the action having been found in the print- 
ing of facsimiles of Whistler's "butterfly" signature 
upon the cover and title-page. (The Collector and 
Art Critic Co.) 



Notes. 

Another of Mr. Clyde Fitch's plays appears in book 
form. It is " Her Own Way," and is published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

A new edition, with revisions, of Mr. James Rhoades's 
blank verse translation of the " ^Eneid " is published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

A new " Art Primer " published by Messrs. Double- 
day, Page & Co. is the work of Dr. Edwin Atlee 
Barber, and has for its subject " Tin Enamelled 
Pottery." 

" The Johannine Literature and The Acts of the 
Apostles,"' by Dr. Henry Prentiss Forbes, is published 
by the Messrs. Putnam in their series of " International 
Handbooks to the New Testament." 

" Experimental and Theoretical Applications of 
Thermodynamics to Chemistry," by Dr. Walther 
Nernst, is a volume of Silliman lectvu^es, given last year 
at Yale, and now published by the Messrs. Scribner. 

Four new volumes, making eight in all, are now 
added by the Messrs. Scribner to their new edition of 
Tourgudniefif. The new volumes are " Smoke," " Vir- 
gin Soil," " Memoirs of a Sportsman," and " The Jew, 
and Other Stories." 

In his " History of the American Whale Fishery," 
Mr. Walter S. Tower has made an economic study of 
an extremely interesting subject, dealing with it more 
systematically and comprehensively than any one before 
him. This monograph is a University of Pennsylvania 
publication. 

Mr. John Ellerton Lodge wrote the musical settings 
for the odes and lyrics of the " Agamemnon " as re- 
cently performed under the auspices of the Greek 
Department of Harvard University. These composi- 
tions (score and text) are now published by Messrs. 
C. W. Thompson & Co. 

A second edition of Professor Douglas Houghton 
Campbell's " University Text-Book of Botany " is pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. The work has been 
revised and corrected in many particulars, although to 
the casual observer it would seem to be much the same 
as when first published five years ago. 

Professors John Hays Gardiner and George Lyman 
Kittredge, with the assistance of Miss Sarah Louise 
Arnold, have prepared a " Manual of Composition and 
Rhetoric," which is an extension and rearrangement of 
their earlier " Elements of English Composition," and 
is now published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers of a 
pamphlet " Historical Miscellany," edited by Mr. Earle 
W. Dow, of which three numbers have already ap- 
peared. The latest of these is a translation of a chapter 



from the " Histoire G^n^rale " of Mme. Lavisse and 
Rambaud, and is entitled " Emancipation of the Medi- 
aeval Towns." The authors of the chapter are Mme. 
A. Giry and A. R^ville, and the translators are Messrs. 
F. G. Bates and P. E. Titsworth. 

" A Bird's-Eye View of American History," by Mr. 
Leon C. Prince, is published by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons. It is difficult to see for whom this work is 
designed. It is not a text-book, for it lacks the neces- 
sary apparatus, and it is written in too dry and con- 
densed a style to attract the general reader. It is, 
moreover, far from impeccable as regards accuracy and 
soundness of judgment. 

A volume by the honorable John Bigelow, entitled 
"Peace Given as the World Giveth; or. The Ports- 
mouth Treaty and its First Year's Fruits," will be 
issued at once by the Baker & Taylor Co. It purposes 
to furnish the evidence that thousands more of lives and 
millions more of property have been destroyed during 
the first year of that peace than could liave been antici- 
pated had the war continued until now. 

The Oliver Ditson Co. have just added to their 
" Musicians' Library " an " Anthology of French Piano 
Music," in two volmnes, edited by M. Isidor Philipp. 
Each volume has a frontispiece group of portraits and 
an introduction, chiefly in the form of condensed bio- 
graphies. These introductions are printed in both 
French and English. Upwards of fifty composers in aU 
are represented, from Chambonniferes and Lully of the 
seventeenth century to such utlra-moderns as Piern^ 
and Debussy of the twentieth. It makes an interesting 
collection, and one only wishes that its showing of 
technical excellence were matched by its musical inspi- 
ration. 

A series of guide-books for students of Spanish art, 
edited by Mr. Albert F. Calvert, is in course of publi- 
cation by the John Lane Co. Three volumes now at 
hand are devoted, respectively, to " MurUlo," " The 
Prado," and " The Escorial." The special feature of 
these volmnes is found in the unusual number of paint- 
ings which are reproduced by photographic process. 
The volume on the Escorial, for example, contains 
nearly three hundred full-page plates. The very mod- 
erate price at which these books are published makes 
them highly acceptable. Of allied interest is Miss 
Edith Harwood's "Notable Pictm-es in Rome," pub- 
lished by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. In this volume 
also the illustrations, although not of full-page size, 
are very numerous and correspondingly helpful to the 
student. 

A group of modern language text-books that have 
been recently published includes the following: " Faust: 
Erster Theil" (Holt), edited by Dr. Julius Goebel; a 
"German Lesson Grammar" (Heath), by Professors 
E S. Joynes and E. C. Wesselhoeft; "A German 
Grammar for Schools and Colleges" (Heath), by Dr. 
Francis Kingsley Ball; "Das Peterle von Niirnberg" 
(Heath), by Herr Viktor Bltithgen, edited by Dr. 
Wilhelm Bernhardt; Corneille's " Le Cid," "Horace," 
and "Polyeucte" (Holt), edited in one volume by 
Professor W. A. Nitze ; Balzac's " Le Pfere Goriot " 
(Heath), edited by Professor R. L. Sanderson; " Quel- 
ques Contes des Romanciers Naturalistes " (Heath), 
edited by Professors Louis H. Dow and Prescott O. 
Skinner; "A Progressive Spanish Reader" (Heath), 
by Dr. Carlos Bransby; and a selection of "Cuentos 
Alegres " (Heath), by Luis Taboada, edited by Mr. 
Mixrray Anthony Potter.

352 THE DIAL [June 1,1907. 

A NEW NOVEL BY THE AUTHOR OF "JOSEPH VANCE." 
William De Morgan's AHce-f Or-ShOft 

12mo, 676 pp., $1.76. 

How many authors in a century have received on their first book such notices as these of " Joseph Vance ? " 

The Dial: "The fictional surprise of the season. A delightful story." 

New York Times Review: " Even 'The Divine Fire,' the boolc of recent years which conies nearest 
to the marlc, must yieid to this." 

The Independent: « if the reader lilccs tK>th < David Copperfield' and < Peter Ibbetson' he can 
find the two boolcs in this one." 

The new novel has all the humor and literary charm of the earlier book with an absorbing plot and a good 
love story. It is a singularly human narrative of English life, reviving the best traditions of the Victorian era 
in its method and flavor, yet thoroughly modern m its materials. 

Early in the story a little London waif tells a friendly artist that she is called " Alice-for-short." Alice 
comes to know this artist's friends and his family. Their fortunes form the theme of this noteworthy and 
remarkable book. The action begins early in the story ; the second chapter is a highly dramatic little tragedy.

" A vivid story of war ... is presented to us through the vision of a just, clear-eyed, warm-hearted, highly educated woman. 
Uncommonly entertaining." — N. Y. Tribune. 

" It is not strange that the author should prefer to keep her name a profound secret. Highborn Russian though she is, it 
would not be good for her health to be known as the author of this surprisingly outspoken volume. Many touches of humor . . . 
Could have been written only by an extraordinarily able woman who knew the inside of Russian politics and . . . Japanese war 
hospitals." — Chicago Record- Herald.

natural. . . . Naturalness, in a word, might be given as the keynote of this strong and tender novel. . . . Deserves more than one

THE TRUST MOVEMENT IN BRITISH 
INDUSTRY 

A Study of Business Organization. 

By HENRY W. MACBOSTY, B.A., Lecturer, London 
School of Economics, and Examiner in Conmierce, Bir- 
mingham University. 8vo. Pp. xvi.-398. $2.50 net. 
In this book the author seeks to trace throughout the 
past twenty-five years the course of the modem movement 
towards industrial combination in all its forms, whether 
in the permanent shape of amalgamations, or in more 
fugitive organizations, such as price-associations, pools, 
sales-syndicates, etc. 

After an analysis of the various forms and a discussion 
of their legal status, the different industries are reviewed in 
turn — iron, coal, textiles, chemicals, milling, tobacco, retail 
trades, miscellaneous industries — and the book concludes 
with some general economic criticisms. 

The work is not propagandist of any special doctrines, 
but is in the main analytical and descriptive. An appen- 
dix of illustrated documents — rules, prospectuses, etc. — 
is included. 



JAPANESE RULE IN FORMOSA 

By Y08ABUR0 TAKEKOSHI, Member of the Japanese 
Diet. With Preface by Baron Shimpei Goto, Chief of 
the Civil Administration. Translated by George Braith- 
waite, Tokyo. With 38 Illustrations and a Map. 8vo. 
Pp. xvi.-342. $3.00 net. 

This book is the outcome of two extensive tours through 
the island undertaken by Mr. Takekoshi, in which he had 
full opportunity of observing the manners and customs of 
the people. 

In the Preface to this book Baron Goto says that the 
history of Japan as a Colonial Power commences with the 
study of its administration in Formosa, and that her failure 
or success there must exercise a marked influence on aU her 
future undertakings in the same direction. 

Baron Goto considers that the plans formed for the 
colonization of Formosa have been crowned with unparal- 
leled success, and thinks that the Japanese cannot be 
accused of unduly boasting in giving to the world the 
story of that success.

The classified facts and authorities presented in this

have sprung up and gained wide sway over vast popula-

GARIBALDI'S DEFENCE OF THE

Trinity College, Cambridge, author of "England in the 

Age of Wycliffe," etc. With 7 Maps and 35 Illustrations. 

8vo. $2.00 net. 

" A work of the highest importance as an authority as 
well as of absorbing interest." — Notes and Queries. 

"No imaginative writer, indeed, from the author of the 
Odyssey down to Dumas and Stevenson, could ever in his 
wildest dreams have rivalled such a tale as the life of 
Garibaldi." — Daily News. 

" The book will certainly not be found dull by the most 
ardent devotee of sensational stories. . . . Mr. Trevelyan 
deserves to be congnratulated on a work which will add much 
to the reputation he has already gained as an historian 
and a man of letters." — The Times. 

" Mr. Trevelyan does not believe that history, because 
it is scholarly, must necessarily be dull, or that its dignity 
is offended by picturesque incident and vivid phraseology. 
He has made his book, to use a common comparison, as 
interesting as a novel ; that is to say, it is much more in- 
teresting than ninety-nine out of every hundred works of 
fiction." — Standard. 



THE WORLD MACHINE: 

The First Phase The Cosmic Mechanism 

By CARL SNYDER, author of "New Conceptions in 
Science," etc. 8vo. 504 pages. $2.50 net. 
•#• An historical survey of the growth of our knowl- 
edge of the material world in which we live, from its 
crudest beginnings to the newest ideas and discoveries 
of the present day. 

" If we might venture on a prophecy, we should say that 
Mr. Snyder is destined to become the leading materialistic 
thinker of the earlier part of this century. . . . This is one 
of the most fascinating and able books which it has ever 
fallen to the lot of the present writer to review. The 
author has a wide range of scientific knowledge — which 
is a highly desirable possession for an enterprise of this 
kind, but by no means so constantly found amongst the 
professed materialists as we might suppose. Furthermore, 
he has the scientific imagination which cannot only reach 
out to large ideas, but can control ihera." — Morning Post. 
" To all who would wish to gather a general knowledge 
of the universe, so far as it is at present known, we would 
recommend this book. The language in which it is written 
is such as is easily understood, and though figures have to 
be employed to give the reader some notion of distance, 
speed, area, etc., no computations are required." — Field.

THi: BREA TH OF ROMANCE. 

The breath of romance bloweth where it 
listeth, but we know not whence it cometh nor 
whither it goeth. So indefinable is its nameless 
charm that we hardly know even what to caU 
it. Try to give a definition of romance, and 
you are baffled ; analyze it, and it disappears ; 
put your finger on it, and it is not there. One 
might as well chase the rainbow or reach out 
for the simset radiance. It is of the nature of 
poetry ; it is sometimes akin to religion ; it 
always has in some measure the element of won- 
der ; in first love it is a potent presence ; and 
we may question whether it entirely leaves us 
except with the breath of life itself. At times 
we feel that it is life, that with the complete 
fading away (were such a thing possible) of the 
vision of its unrealized, its ever-to-be-desired 
beauty and excellence, there would die also the 
very soul within us. 

And yet one feels that it is utterly different 
from self. Nothing is more emphatically the 
not-seK. To attain the romantic, we long to be 
where we are not, to do what we are not now 
doing. If in Syracuse, N. Y., we would be in 
Syracuse, Sicily ; from Paris we turn eyes of 
desire toward Rome ; gliding down the Rhine, 
we wish to exchange our steamboat for a gon- 
dola, the river for a canal in Venice. Anywhere 
but here, — any time but now! Anything to 
escape from self ! We are filled with a divine 
unrest. The savage has been defined as a be- 
ing who has no past and no future ; and so we 
— at least until we have attained the peace that 
passeth understanding — refuse to find perfect 
content in the here and now. We race through 
one novel only to take up another, and if pos- 
sible a better ; delight our souls with Keats, 
and then leave him for Chaucer ; follow breath- 
less the rapid story of Benvenuto Cellini's 
eventful life, and straightway ask for Amiel's 
Journal. The remote in time and place are 
romantic only so long as they are remote. " A 
ship," says Emerson, " is a romantic object to 
those who behold it from the shore, not to those 
on board.*' To honest Nick Bottom in good 
old England the African lion is an object of 
shuddering fascination, " for there is not a more 
fearful wild-fowl than your lion, living." 

The imperious craving for the ideal and the 



360 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



romantic is never more strongly upon us than 
when we are in love. John Newton, sea-captain, 
slave-trader, hard and severe divine, and not 
too sympathetic friend of Cowper, had his expe- 
rience of this, for he was once most desperately 
in love ; and in that golden time he used to go 
all the way (on foot, we may suppose) from 
London to Shooter's Hill, wherever that may 
be, simply to look toward the quarter where 
dwelt the future Mrs. Newton. Not that he 
could catch the faintest glimpse of gable-end or 
chimney-pot to mark the sacred spot, for she 
lived far beyond the range of his vision even 
after he had travelled all those miles and 
climbed to the top of the hLU ; but it gratified 
the lover, as he afterward assured a friend, to 
be able merely to look in her direction ; and 
this pleasure he indulged in regularly once a 
week, and sometimes twice. What drove New- 
ton to seek the summit of Shooter's Hill must 
have been the " pricking pain " of which Plato 
tells us. " Man's soul, in a former state," he 
says, " was winged, and soared among the gods ; 
and so it comes to pass that, in this life, when 
the soul, by the power of music or poetry, or 
the sight of beauty, hath her remembrance 
quickened, forthwith there is a struggling and 
a pricking pain as of wings trying to come 
forth, — even as children in teething." 

Romance is not a thing made by novelists 
and poets, as the matter-of-fact man asserts, 
any more than the peach is made by its bloom, 
the brook by the babble of its waters, or the 
volcano by its crater. Against any such theory 
the romancer himself protests. " Let us look 
up in fear and reverence," exclaims Mrs. Stowe 
in glowing phrase in " The Minister's Wooing," 
" and say, ' God is the great maker of romance. 
He, from whose hand came man and woman, — 
He, who strung the great harp of Existence 
with all its wild and wonderful and manifold 
chords, and attuned them to one another, — He 
is the great Poet of life.' . . . The scoffing 
spirit that laughs at romance is an apple of the 
Devil's own handing from the bitter tree of 
knowledge ; it opens the eyes only to see eternal 
nakedness. K ever you have had a romantic, 
uncalculating friendship, a boundless worship 
and belief in some hero of your soul, — if ever 
you have so loved that all cold prudence, all 
selfish worldly considerations, have gone down 
like driftwood before a river flooded with new 
rain from heaven, so that you even forgot your- 
self, and were ready to cast your whole being 
into the chasm of existence, as an offering before 
the feet of another, and all for nothing, — if 



you awoke bitterly betrayed and deceived, still 
give thanks to God that you have had one 
glimpse of heaven. The door now shut will 
open again." 

But the romance of love and friendship is, as 
already intimated, only a part, though the most 
important and interesting part, of romance as a 
whole. Goethe has said that nothing is more 
significant of a man's character than what he 
finds laughable. More significant even than 
the amusing or ridiculous is that wherein a man 
finds charm, wonder, poetry, romance. There 
is a romance of science, of natural history, of 
astronomy, of pure mathematics even, and of 
metaphysics, as tridy as there is a romance 
of love and of friendship. Jenkin on " Bridge 
Construction," or Crehore on "The Mechanics 
of the Girder," or Stoney's " Theory of Stresses," 
may not contain so much poetry or romance for 
you or me as for the artificer in wood and iron 
and stone. Ruskin's " Seven Lamps of Archi- 
tecture " has far more. Archimedes, in his 
dream of a fulcrum firm enough and a lever 
long enough to enable him to tumble the earth 
about in space, betrayed the romantic tempera- 
ment. The romance of an epoch expresses 
itself through its typical genius. The chapters 
of Alexander's romance were military cam- 
paigns ; the Gracchi wrote theirs in terms of 
agrarian laws ; Demosthenes has left his in the 
form of orations. All the world has read or 
has heard about Darwin's epoch-making ro- 
mance ; for that the theory of evolution is, in 
certain aspects, a splendid romance, cannot be 
denied. Its author comes no nearer to absolute 
proof of his conclusions in "The Origin of 
Species " and " The Descent of Man " than does 
Cervantes to proof of the essential beauty and 
dignity and sanity of his hero's character. 
Romance did not die in 1832 with Scott and 
Goethe, but it presently assumed new form 
in Darwin's pages, flashed a new light in his dis- 
coveries, and took possession of a new domain. 
The product of the " scientific imagination " 
was for a period, for an interim, to serve as 
food for the romance-hunger of the English- 
speaking world. But it was a scientific imagi- 
nation held well in hand ; not even Poe's " Fall 
of the House of Usher " being more circum- 
stantial. It dealt in fullest detail with the 
actual, thus meeting the demands of an age 
somewhat surfeited with romance of the old- 
fashioned kind, an age that had outgrown the 
instinct that in childhood asks for what cannot 
be (the fairytale), and in manhood demands what 
might be (the story of love, of friendship, of war,

of religious devotion). Such an age no longer 
wishes, in Hazlitt's words, to be what it is not 
and to do what it cannot, but still craves, even 
in the actually existent, some glimpse of the yet 
unattained, some glamour of romance, some 
subject-matter for wonder. In ripe maturity 
as in callow infancy, man hungers for the ideal, 
the unrealized, and (he is driven to confess it) 
the imrealizable. A realizable ideal would be 
intolerable. The more and more nearly ap- 
proachable, but never quite attainable, can 
alone charm us. 

Romance, no more than religion, has any- 
thing to fear from science. The more extended 
the sphere of the known shall become through 
scientific research, just so much larger a surface 
will it present to the circumjacent unknowable ; 
and in this latter reside the wonderful, the 
romantic, the poetic, the ideal. What Matthew 
Arnold said twenty-seven years ago about the 
hopeful future of poetry is no less true of 
romance, the two shading imperceptibly into 
each other. This promising future of what 
we may, borrowing from Wordsworth, call "the 
breath and finer spirit of all knowledge," is 
limitless. To close with Arnold's words, its 
future " is immense, because in poetry [and in 
romance in the large sense], where it is worthy 
of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, 
will find an ever surer and surer stay. There 
is not a creed which is not shaken, not an 
accredited dogma which is not shown to be 
questionable, not a received tradition which 
does not threaten to dissolve. Our religion has 
materialized itself in the fact, in the supposed 
fact ; it has attached its emotion to the fact, 
and now the fact is failing it. But for poetry 
[and romance] the idea is everything ; the rest 
is a world of illusion, of divine illusion. Poetry 
attaches its emotion to the idea ; the idea is the 
fact. The strongest part of our religion to-day 
is its unconscious poetry." 

Percy F. Bicbuuell. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The eighty-eighth birthday of an old New- 
Englander whom many outside of little old New 
England delight to honor was celebrated a few 
weeks ago, when Mrs. Julia Ward Howe completed 
four-score and eight years. Father Knickerbocker 
proudly claims her as his child, for she was born in 
New York, in Marketfield Street, near the present 
Produce Exchange, where a few ancient brick 
houses of that time (1819) are still to be seen. The 
tribute of a bowl of roses from the Greeks of Boston 
was, of course, a touching reminder to Mrs. Howe 



of the reflected fame she still enjoys as widow of 
Dr. Samuel G. Howe, whose ardent participation in 
the Greek war for independence now lies more than 
three-quarters of a century in the past, but has very 
recently been vividly recalled to memory by his 
daughter's publication of the young surgeon-soldier's 
diaries. As reviving memories of a much later war, 
let us quote a few words from Mrs. Howe's account 
of the writing of her famous " Battle Hymn," She 
was returning from a parade of Federal troops, and 
"to pass the time away we sang 'John Brown's 
Body.' Some of the marching regiments took it up, 
and it was passed along the road until the echoes 
reverberated for miles. My pastor asked me why 
I did not put the spirit of 'John Brown's Body 
Lies a-Mouldering in the Grave ' into some graceful 
and expressive words. I told him I had tried. One 
morning soon after that I awoke suddenly about 
daylight, and the lines I wanted were vaguely run- 
ning through my mind. I arose and wrote them down. 
They were published in the Atlantic Monthly, and 
the editor [Lowell] named them ' The Battle Hymn 
of the Republic' " 

Emerson as judged by his classmates and his 
teachers at college passed for neither very studious 
nor very brilliant, but most amiable, winning, and 
modest, and given to blushing on small provocation. 
Some of his fellows even thought him dull, and very 
few predicted for him a distinguished future. Mr. 
Fraii B. Sanborn touched on this interesting matter 
at the celebration of Emerson's 104th birthday, and 
adduced also the judgment of another contemporary, 
Alcott, who wrote (about 1838) of his not then 
famous feUow-townsman : " The day shall come 
when this man's genius shall shine beyond the circle 
of his own city and nation ; it shall flash across the 
wide water, and receive the homage of other peoples. 
Emerson is destined to be the high literary name of 
this age. Other men we have who ply small trade 
in the nooks and comers of this wide sea, and whose 
wares are pedled at this place and that; but this 
man's genius is cosmopolitan, and shall be in demand 
wherever man has risen above the mere mechanics 
and utilities of life." Theodore Parker, after a 
dozen years' acquaintance with Emerson, spoke of 
his culture in a way that, as Mr. Sanborn intimates, 
contrasts strangely with Mr. Woodberry's later pro- 
nouncement. Parker wrote : " Emerson's literary 
culture is of him, and not merely on him. His 
learning appears not in his quotations, but in his 
talk. His reading gives a certain richness to his 
style, which is more literary than that of any Amer- 
ican writer ; as much so as Jeremy Taylor's." The 
later critic assures us that " his reading was strange 
but not learned." Yet who shall assert that Parker, 
whose reading was both strange and learned, was 
no good judge of literary culture ? The failure of 
Emerson's young associates to discern the embryo 
sage need not cause surprise. Schoolboys are pro- 
verbially quick to take the measure of a man, but 
are as blind to undeveloped genius as the rest of us.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Stories of extraordinary thefts have done 
much to enliven the pages of literature ; and they 
also at times relieve the humdrum monotony of life, 
though not to the equal satisfaction of all parties 
concerned. In prose fiction, Mark Twain has given 
us ''The Stolen White Elephant." In the drama, 
Susannah Centlivre amused London play-goers a 
generation ago with the comedy of "The Stolen 
Heiress," and Paul Merritt entertained them with 
" Stolen Kisses " ( not the most extraordinary kind 
of stealing, it must be admitted), while patrons of 
the present-day stage have enjoyed the complications 
of "The Stolen Story." The rich plunder of the 
Forty Thieves made glad the heart and plethoric 
the pocket of the poor Persian woodcutter Ali Baba ; 
and a far different kind of theft brought sorrow 
to the hearts of many pious members of a New 
England community in much more recent times, as 
may be read in a slender pamphlet printed about 
fifty years ago and entitled, " Stolen ! From Many 
Citizens in Cambridge, on the 4th Instant, the Rest 
and Quiet of the Holy Sabbath Day " — by reason 
of the unpuritanical determination of the Union 
Railway Company to run its cars on Sunday. 
Finally, it was but yesterday, so to speak, that some 
energetic Japanese patriots — vandals, the indig- 
nant Koreans would call them — carried off the 
massive white marble pagoda of P'ung-duk from the 
environs of Seoul, which one would have supposed 
to be as improbable a bit of souvenir-collecting as 
the purloining, if we can imagine it, of our Wash- 
ington Monument by the English, or the pocketing 
of Grant's tomb at Riverside Park by (let us say) 
some nephew or grandson of Jefferson Davis. But 
it has long been a subject of remark that truth is 
stranger than fiction. What invention of the fancy 
could rival that remarkable larceny of a well 
belonging to Abraham, which, as we read in 
" Genesis," Abimelech's servants violently carried 
away? 

The longevity of a good joke is a matter of 
common knowledge. A juicy joke of pronounced 
human flavor enjoys — to quote from one of Lamb's 
long-forgotten sonnets — " more days than went to 
make the gem that crowned the white top of Methu- 
salem." Mr. Andrew Lang has lately written a good 
but almost too erudite account of certain transfers 
and transmissions and re-applications and (if one 
may say so) reincarnations of tried and tested 
stories. His unusual familiarity with Scotch history 
and legend furnishes him with abundant illustration 
of the imperishability of a tale that contains elements 
of universal appeal. He even goes so far as to 
assert that " an Egyptian myth of a sort only quot- 
able in scientific circles is current among the most 
untutored Australian black fellows, whose ancestors 
may have heard Ham narrate it in the Ark. Ghost 
stories are just as old." He frankly confesses in 
regard to himself : " Among other ways of amassing 
unpopularity, I have the odious habit of criticising 



a tale told to me, for example, about Miss X., who 
still lives and decorates society. ' I find that yarn 
first in Grammont's Memoirs,' I say ; ' it has a 
traceable pedigree of more than two centuries.' " 
A story has recently been told of one of our college 
professors who is said to be so absent-minded that, 
after leaving his house and posting on the door the 
hour of his expected return, if he comes back before 
the advertised time he sits down and waits for him- 
self to come and open the door. Soon after hearing 
this anecdote we chanced upon the very same story 
told of a certain bishop of Copenhagen some cen- 
tiu-ies ago. ... 

The irritability of poets is proverbial, as 
we are often reminded by the well-worn Latin 
phrase. An amusing instance is now reported in 
which not even death, reconciler of foes, availed to 
mitigate the irascibility of one poet toward another. 
Rumor, ever fertile in invention, would have us 
believe that at a recent spiritistic sSance in Rome 
a table violently hurled itself at Signore Gabriele 
d'Annunzio and chased him with fell intent around 
the room ; and this astonishing display of ferocity 
on the table's part is attributed to the lately-deceased 
poet Carducci as instigator and prime mover, the 
lamented bard being known to have cherished very 
unfriendly feelings toward his junior fellow-poet. 
But there is more to tell. Not content with phy- 
sical violence, the quadrupedal agent of Carducci's 
animosity proceeded to rap out some very uncom- 
plimentary opinions of the hated one's literary pro- 
ductions. Friends of the young man are now 
apprehensive of what may occur if a certain famous 
actress, with whom he is at variance, crosses the bar 
before him. Combining their forces, his two enemies 
might easily toss a grand piano at him in an un- 
guarded moment, or give him his quietus with one 
of the ample wardrobes in which he keeps his 
ninety-nine changes of raiment. The prospect is 
full of terror. If dead authors and artists are to 
enjoy post-mortem privileges in wreaking vengeance 
on living foes, who wUl have the courage to pass 
unprejudiced judgment on their works?

" Phonographic canned tongue," as records 
of the human voice are expressively called, has a 
value that will increase with the passage of time — 
being in this respect quite unlike the literal tinned 
beef. What would we not give to hear the nervous 
accents, the ipsissima vox, so to speak, of Frederick 
the Great, as future ages will listen to the august ut- 
terance of his great -great -great -grand -nephew, 
WiUiam the Sudden! Think of having at our 
command one of Shakespeare's sonnets recited by 
himself, as our descendants will have (let us say) a 
poem of Mr. Alfred Austin's in the laureate's very 
tones. How glorious to be thrilled by the em- 
balmed eloquence of Demosthenes on the Crown (if 
our Attic Greek were not getting a little rusty) as an 
audience of the forty-second century may be electri-

Bryan on monopoly and trusts ! And with a vita-

the conservation of pronunciation in its pristine

opposed to it the inflexible conservatism of the 
phonographic record. Like the standard metre 
preserved at Paris, we might have a standard pro-

Encouragement to ditllakds at school is 
found, now as always, in the unbrilliant traits of 
many a youngster who afterward achieved fame. 
Some one ought to collect statistics to determine 
whether more smart scholars have turned out fools, 
or vice versa, and whether most great men were 
industrious or idle, bright or dull, in the school- 
room. It is now told of Sir Hiram Maxim that he 
believes himself to have been the stupidest and also 
the best-behaved pupil at his first school ; and in 
proof of his youthful stupidity he relates the story 
of the leather medal he won on a certain memor- 
able day. It was the last day of the term, a proud 
day for Hiram's younger sister, for to her was 
awarded the first prize. Other prizes were also 
bestowed, and then the teacher said : " I wUl now 
give a leather medal to the most stupid scholar in 
the school." " I looked about me," says Sir Hiram, 
" and I was quite certain it must be Kimm Casley, 
the double-thumbed boy. But no ; the teacher 
selected Hiram Maxim. I went forward and was 
given the only medal I have ever received in my 
life for anything relating to education."

A GRIEVANCE OF ENGLISH AUTHORSHIP is due to 

the income tax, from which Americans, literate and 
illiterate, are exempt. The question was recently 
raised in the House of Commons whether royalties 
on books should be regarded as earned or unearned 
income ; the tax on unearned income — income 
from investments — being fourpence in the pound 
higher than on earned income, or salaries. It was 
decided by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that 
this question must be determined by the circum- 
stances of each case, separately considered. And 
so the indignant, if not indigent, author is likely to 
find himself mulcted for not selling his wares out- 
right instead of patiently waiting year after year 
for the uncertain royalties that constitute his preca- 
rious revenue.

The AMENITIES OF literary CRITICISM are 
amusingly illustrated by Mr. Frank Harris's 
condemnatory comments on Professor Raleigh's 
" Shakespeare," which he calls, among other things, 
" an old housewife's rag-bag," " a stew," " feeble- 
foolish," " fulsome-dishonest," and altogether " a 



disgrace to English scholarship." This command 
of invective is no more than might have been 
expected in an ex-editor of a certain London literary 
review issued on the last day of each week ; and 
the fact that Mr. Harris once wrote a book himself 
on " The Man Shakespeare " probably gives him 
in this instance additional confidence and freedom 
in ventUating his vocabulary. It may be, however, 
that he, no more than his victim, looks upon this 
kind of smartly-picturesque denunciation as serious 
criticism ; nay, more, it is very possible that, in the 
kindness of his heart, he is printing this array of 
unusual adjectives and nouns as the surest means 
of advertising an excellent book.

Sixteenth-century drama on a twentieth- 
century STAGE is a spectacle so rare (if we leave 
out of account such of Shakespeare's plays as fall 
within that century) that it deserves to be noted. 
Marlowe's " Dr. Faustus " was produced last month 
by the English Department of Princeton Univer- 
sity, all the parts being taken by undergi-aduates. 
This was the first presentation of the play on an 
American stage, we believe, and it was received 
with favor by a large audience. It was not long 
ago that Udall's " Ralph Royster Doyster " enjoyed 
a similar success at the hands of Harvard students ; 
and a little earlier still Greene's " Friar Bacon and 
Friar Bungay " was very creditably rendered at the 
University of Illinois. In university circles at any 
rate the English drama might be in worse case than 
it is to-day.

manuscript was found among Mill's effects in the

to be merely the introduction to a detailed treatment 
of the same subject. Interest in social questions is 
now at its height, but it may well be doubted whether 
an essay written a third of a century ago in the 
retirement of Avignon will greatly further the solu- 
tion of present-day problems. However, as a sequel

The Wild FiiOAVERS or England.* 



One of the recurrent joys of our latter- 
day springs is the forthputting of the many 
books which may be broadly classed as garden- 
books, since they have to do with flowers in 
somebody's gardens, either man's or Nature's. 
For the sake of the almost limitless power and 
range of their suggestion, it is easily forgiven 
the writers of many of these essays into well- 
known or imknown fields that they handicap 
their work with recitals of the sayings and do- 
ings of all sorts and conditions of men, women, 
and even babies ; but it is always a far greater 
pleasure to find that the writer has trusted to 
the growing green things themselves for the 
interest of the book, and has left out the sug- 
gestions of human presence save an occasional 
modest " I." It is thus with the beautiful vol- 
ume entitled " Natures Own Garden," which 
has come to us from over-seas, from which it 
will be so great a pleasure to quote that only a 
thin thread of comment is needed to hold the 
excerpts together. 

The keynote of Mrs. Clarke's work is struck 
in the words of Richard JefPeries which stand 
in the place of the dedication that should have 
been offered to his beloved memory, so full is 
the book of the spirit that came into the world 
with Thoreau and found its highest exemplar 
in the author of " The Story of My Heart." It 
would hardly have been possible to write " Na- 
ture's Own Garden " had not Jefferies shared 
with us the wonderful and beautiful thoughts 
born of his close friendship with English fields 
and commons, English lanes and hedgerows, 
English copses and woodlands, and the banks 
of English brooks and rivers. The dear un- 
praised growths which Nature has always loved, 
and to which he gave the devotion of his too- 
short life, but which men often call common or 
even unclean, by his earnest disciple are treated 
with the sympathy and justice with which he 
ever won " the secret of the weed's plain heart." 
Eyes hungering for beauty are again, as in 
Jefferies's enchanting pages, persuaded to look 
at things that are near and common, and to find 
it there ; and herein lies the value of this book. 
Rarely has attention been more clearly called 
to the decorative possibilities of many obscure 
water-loving plants ; rarely have nature's ways 

* Natubk's Own Garden. Written and illustrated, in line 
and colour, by Maud Umfreville Clarke. New york: E. P. 
Button & Co. 



of grouping and massing, the value of wide 
plantings of single species, or the infinite fore- 
thought for succession, been better understood ; 
and still more rarely has a book been so filled 
with an ever-present sense of the relations of 
each tiniest moss with the universe of life. 

To give a taste of the quality of the book, 
we quote a passage on English grass-fields in 
June. 

" When each and all of the Nature Gardens are so 
lovely in their own particular way, it is unwise to show 
partiality; and yet there is something dangerously like 
it, if I say that the gardens of the grass-fields in June 
seem to hold the largest possibilities of any. . '. . The 
corn-fields have their very definite beauty, but there is 
not the variety of plants growing among the corn that 
the grass can muster. 

" It seems such a perfectly content and satisfactory 
family, studding the green with all colours: white and 
yellow, orange, blue and pink of many shades. And 
there are not the obvious signs of struggle; so many 
of the species stand in an orderly height with each 
other — all can drink up the moisture below, and sway 
in the warm air freely; a garden of much beatitude. 
As the weeks of June add together, the flowers' strength 
and the strength of the grass seem to rise and swell into 
the fullest tide of the flowers' year. 

" The woods are busy, and the hedges showing all 
their strength of beautiful things ; but the heart of Jime 
seems in the grass-fields standing for hay. One watches 
the growing magnificence with a joy that becomes fret- 
ted with a fear — for there wiU be a sudden turning of 
that tide, not at the hand of Nature, for her proceedings 
are never sudden, but at the hand of man." 

Here is a pretty picture of the Harebell : 

" There is a distinctive thinness and lightness in the 
Harebell flowers that suggest the surround of the wind ; 
the flower that living on high land is evolved during 
months of ceaseless wind-rush. Utterly unlike the 
Orchid of the woods, constructed of moisture-laden 
cells, the Harebells have been formed under circum- 
stances when moisture was at a minimum. The winds 
dry ofP all evaporation rapidly when the Harebell is"" 
blooming, and July and August sunshine beats down 
upon the land extracting the value of every thunder 
shower. It is as if the pale blue-bells were stretched 
to the attenuation of parchment by constant adaptation 
to the wind-rush — constant gift to the demand of cir- 
cumstance, yet nothing painfully, for all is orderly in 
the slow steps by which sensation is expressed in char- 
acteristic form. Being perfected as wind-flowers, they 
bend to it with ease in all ways; sudden gusts or fierce 
onslaughts when September catches the flower with 
storms, are met by the Harebell's wiriness of growth 
as accustomed events; it is equal to them as a natural 
contact of surrounding." 

Heather has seldom been better portrayed 
than in this extract : 

" This is the garden-ground proper for the Heather, 
where there is wide space for it, and the slopes and 
hollows, down to the bed of the peaty streams where 
the sundew thrives and catches all its need of the great 
insect-humming world that dances over the purple sea. 
All the space of the wide arms of the land stretched out

under the sun; all the run of light and shadow over it; 
all the himi and song above it; and the life of the tribes 
in Nature that creep and burrow and tunnel out their 
homes deep in the Heather roots — this is the glory of 
one of Nature's best gardens. And where the land is 
the Heather's own, it makes and names the place so in 
its own language of pure colour: crimson that is deep 
where the sprays tuft in shadow, and crimson that, 
catching the blue of the sky on all the myriad of little 
bells, turns a softer and bluer note on the upper swells 
of the land, and on into the long distance where the 
haze wraps blue and crimson together as one, and in all 
of it the glory of the Heather sings in the silences. 
The heat beats down upon it, and brings out the aromatic 
scent powerfully, something pungent and yet sweet, as 
baffling to close scrutiny as the shifting of colour-lines 
to the eye ; the division-lines of partitions are not there ; 
in both these is the weaving to and fro of much com- 
plexity that defies decision. 

" But the moors in Summer are not for decisions, but 
for the receiving of matters that are given in breadth 
and place ; songs sung through great chords. ... It is 
the . crescendo pitch: the apex of the great arch that 
slants toward dusk, when the purple is sapped slowly 
away by grey mist, and the hollows get darker and 
darker into wonderful violet-browns that pass again 
into nothing but the soft dark of earth on a summer 
night." 

It is like being " in England now that April 's 

there," or " when the spray is white with May," 

to turn these pages, in which are blossoming 

the flowers that began to blossom for Chaucer 

and that still look up into all eyes akin to his. 

Many of the wide margins bear pen-drawings 

for the comfort of the reader who does not 

know what borage looks like or what stitchwort 

is. Many other large colored plates are due to 

the clever brush-work of the author ; but here 

is to be felt something of the disappointment 

that always accompanies the eager glance which 

first greets any effort to express the meaning 

of flowers in a mass. One cannot always 

recognize the flowers of the text in the plates, — 

they are often too broad in treatment and too 

vague in color ; but they add greatly to our 

pleasure by a certain stimulating quality which 

unites the plant to the landscape in a very 

delightful way. o a o

The dome of the British Museum reading-room 
is thought to be in danger of collapse ; hence the room 
is to be closed for repairs during the summer and fall, 
special accommodation being provided elsewhere in 
the building for those engaged in literary research of 
exceptional importance. It has been conjectured that 
the only reason why the dome has not long since fallen 
on the studious heads beneath is that the density of 
the atmosphere, which has caused so many of those 
heads to ache, upheld the structure and so saved 
them from what might have made them ache- still 
worse, or have even put an end to their capacity for 
aching at all. 



Studies in Anim al. IiIfe.* 

The latest volume in the " Nature Series " 
of illustrated works dealing with various phases 
of the living world is concerned with a group of 
animals that bring to the minds of most read- 
ers only a shudder of horror. Seekers for 
thrills will not find in the pages of Mr. Ditmars's 
" Reptile Book " much exciting literature, 
though they may run across some good snake- 
stories, and can readily satisfy the most morbid 
appetite for a chilly feeling down the back or 
for that undesirable tension of the scalp that 
most of us experience at the rustle of a snake 
in the grass. One has only to scan the many 
photographs of serpents in various attitudes of 
action and repose, which the author has very 
cleverly collected, to appreciate how effective a 
temperance tract he has unwittingly prepared ! 

If, however, the reader turns from a casual 
inspection of the book to a careful perusal of 
its pages, he very soon finds that all reptiles are 
not as black as they are painted, — that, indeed, 
they may even become exceedingly interest- 
ing. Turtles, alligators, lizards, and even some 
snakes, make tractable and interesting pets, 
learn to eat from their keeper's hand, and, if 
properly kept, thrive in captivity. It is high 
time that man as a rational being should stop 
his indiscriminate bruising of serpents' heads 
and limit the action of his heel to those that 
actually do menace human life. Some species — 
as, for example, the gopher snakes — are bene- 
ficial to the farmer by their destruction of ro- 
dents, and most of the common species are at 
least innocuous. Let us hope that Mr. Ditmars's 
book may do something toward increasing the 
number of advocates of the rights of even snakes 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of such vermin 
as they need. 

The author, as Keeper of Reptiles in the New 
York Zoological Gardens, has had exceptional 
opportunities to study this interesting but much 
neglected group under ideal conditions. His 
photographs are most excellent, and are very 
life-like with a few exceptions where preserved 
material appears to have been used.

"My camera has worked hard and faithfully, and 
the details of structure have been fully portrayed; but 
in a work like this colour value in the pattern is of great 
importance, and here the camera has its limitations, 
though assisted by the ray-filter and colour-sensitive 
plates. A great amount of work was done upon the 
negatives themselves, and in this the use of restraining 
dyes formed an important part; some of the developed 
plates were put through a half-dozen processes before 
they passed a satisfactory test. Those illustrations of 
snakes that are blotched or ringed with scarlet (a diffi- 
cult problem for the camera) are good examples of the 
final result." 

The author exhibits a fine scorn for details of 
nomenclature, and for anatomical and structural 
features, especially internal characters not easily 
seen by the careless observer. It is very evident, 
however, that more care on his part to insure the 
correct terminology would have added greatly 
to the permanent value of his work, and fur- 
thermore that its general usefulness would have 
been greatly enhanced by a more generous in- 
clusion of pertinent anatomical, physiological, 
and oecological detail. It is to be presumed that 
the general reader would be quite as much in- 
terested in the structure of the poison glands 
and fangs of the rattlesnake, or in the peculiar 
pineal eye of lizards, or in the relations of color 
changes in reptiles to heat and cold, as in ex- 
tended accounts of the superficial markings of 
various species. This narrow approach to the 
subject has somewhat marred the proportions 
of an otherwise valuable treatise. 

A series of popular essays on the natural 
history of ants and other insects that exhibit 
highly developed instincts and habits are in- 
cluded in a volume entitled " Nature's Crafts- 
men," from the pen of the veteran entomologist 
and student of insect activities. Dr. Henry C. 
McCook. The score of chapters are, for the 
most part, revisions or expansions of recent 
magazine articles, supplemented by considerable 
new material, and all are abundantly illustrated. 
They are largely drawn from the field of the 
author's specialty, the study of ants and spiders, 
with a number of original studies of wild bees, 
water spiders, caddis flies, wasps, and ant-lions. 
The various chapters deal with such subjects as 
the life of the queen ant, the dispersal of ant 
colonies, the aphid herds and the habits of ants 
in the care of their aphid flocks, the personal 
hygiene of ants and methods of emmet sanita- 
tion, the slave-making forays and the relations 
between captor and vassal, the so-called agri- 
cultural ants, and the curious honey ants of the 
far West. Not the least interesting chapter is 
that which deals with aeronautic spiders. 



" Let one walk in the fields on a warm October day 
when a soft breeze is blowing. If he will stoop low and 
glance along the meadow, his eye will catch the sheen 
of myriads of fine silken filaments. They float from 
every elevated spot. They fringe fence-posts and hedges. 
They stream like pennants from tall weeds. They 
interlace the foliage of bushes with delicate meshes, or 
flutter like ribbons from their tops. These are the ropes 
and netting of ballooning spiders. 

" If, now, one will glance upward, he will be apt to 
see long, white, sinuous filaments drifting through the 
air, over tree-tops, across streams, far aloft, or perhaps 
low enough to be within reach. If he will grasp one of 
these threads he may find in his hand a small spider; 
but not always, for many drifting filaments are simply 
trial threads, or loose bits of the drag-lines which spi- 
ders are apt to throw out as anchors when they walk. 
His captive will be a flying-spider, arrested in aeronautic 
flight, and the silken filament is, in fact, her balloon." 

Dr. McCook's work is popular in the sense 
that it deals with " phases of natural life that 
come most easily into common thought and in- 
terest," but its spirit is scientific and its literary 
form is excellent. The character of the con- 
tents, the interesting nature of the observations 
related, and the clearness and grace of the 
author's style, all combine to place the book in 
the first rank of popular natural histories. 
While the author of " The Reptile Book " has 
yielded to the English, or perhaps entomologi- 
cal, habit of appending a common name to each 
species, in almost all cases coined directly from 
the Latin scientific name, Dr. McCook has 
wisely presumed that the intelligence of his 
readers is sufficient to justify the use of the 
scientific name without the accompanying vul- 
gar patronymic. 

Mr. Charles John Cornish, the author of 
" Animal Artisans," was an English school- 
master at St. Paul's School, London, an Oxford 
man, and a contributor for many years to " The 
Spectator " and " Country Life " (English) of 
essays on natural-history subjects. This volume 
of essays, edited by his wife, is to the American 
reader an interesting revelation of the attitude 
of the educated Englishman toward natural 
history. The range of topics discussed is indeed 
a wide one, reaching from the " Fauna of the 
Railroad " to " Canary Culture," and from " The 
Simple Life " to " Animals and their Clothes," 
Running through the nearly two-score chapters 
is a great deal of clever field observation upon

sportsman-naturalist, imbued with a love of 
nature, and endowed with a keen eye for sig- 
nificant, interesting, or unusual phenomena, 
might make. These observations are recorded 
in excellent form, and, as might be expected.

with abundant literary and historical allusion, 
as in the following example : 

" Whence the legend of the swan-song came is not 
very certain. It was one of the tales of the ancients; 
but, like most other fables concerning birds and beasts, 
was very early questioned. Even Pliny, in his great 
reservoir of nonsense about animals, doubted it; and so 
did Athenseus and others. Sir Thomas Browne noted 
it among his ' vulgar errors.' But the call of the hooper 
swan, as it flies, is very striking, and when uttered by 
night may well have given rise to the story." 

One receives the impression that the natural 
history here recorded is the outcome of an avo- 
cation. It lacks the tension, and the critical 
point of view, of the trained scientist. It 
reveals a temper of mind fostered by and 
perhaps expressed in the many British natural 
history field-clubs, a diversion akin to the 
Briton's love of sport, but with added intel- 
lectual and aesthetic elements. How rarely, 
indeed, in the rush of our American life, do 
we find time or occasion to cultivate this con- 
templative temper of mind toward nature ! In 
the rivalry of our vocations have we not too 
much neglected the contribution which this 
avocation might make to the sanity and health 
of our intellectual life ?

Books for Garden-IjOVers.* 



Although it is comparatively but few years 
since Americans began to take a vital interest 
in gardening, and in beautifying the surround- 
ings of their homes, the number of writers on 
the subject has grown so rapidly that one is 
tempted to vary the words of Solomon to read, 
" Of making many garden books there is no 
end." Yet so long as they contain something 
novel either in matter or form, there can hardly 
be too many of them. Besides giving welcome 
to the increasing number of works from our 
own side of the water, we are glad to have the 
attractive and interesting volumes from older 
countries where gardening has so long been a 
joy and where beautiful gardens are as famous 
as storied castles. 

Mr. W. Robinson, a well-known writer on 
English gardens, has given us a work entitled 
" The Garden Beautiful," which, although in-

tended chiefly for English readers, has hardly 
less interest for garden-makers in this country, 
especially those who would plant or improve 
woodland. The secondary title of the book, 
" Home Woods, Home Landscape," suggests 
its character ; and although Mr. Robinson has 
several chapters on other aspects of garden- 
making, it is the larger eifects and methods 
that he here makes prominent. In the begin- 
ning, he fulminates with something of the same 
sort of indignation Ruskin shows against false 
ideas of beauty, and he is a sharp critic of pre- 
tenders and pretentious writers. He himself is 
a serious and earnest worker in landscape gar- 
dening (he scorns the expression " landscape 
architect," which he considers a contradiction 
in terms), and he illustrates his principles with 
numerous examples of work already carried 
out. Some of the specific subjects considered 
are flowering shrubs and trees, climbers, rock 
and wall gardens, the wild garden, the aspects 
of the flower garden in different seasons, the 
" new " rose garden, marsh, bog, and water 
gardens, fragrance, the orchard beautiful, lawns, 
and playgrounds. Nearly half the book is de- 
voted to the home woods — the woodland gar- 
den, the large trees of the northern forests, 
evergreen covert, underwoods, mixed woods, 
waste in planting, fencing for woodland, and 
other branches of the subject. The author has 
a final chapter defending his use of common 
English names of plants and trees ; and here 
we must differ with him. He is doubtless right 
in his contention that the Latin names, which 
are subject to change at the hands of scientists, 
are frequently confusing or misleading to the 
amateur ; but since the popular English names 
are not always common to all English-speaking 
countries, a glossary that would furnish a com- 
mon meeting-ground would make the book more 
valuable. There is a fairly good index, and the 
book is dignified in appearance, without illus- 
trations. 

Mr. Eben E. Rexford, whose name is found 
in the tables of contents of many popular mag- 
azines as an authority on gardening topics, has 
brought some of these papers together in a vol- 
ume entitled " Four Seasons in the Garden." 
The title is an arbitrary one, for the chapters, 
while they include such titles as "Spring in 
the Garden," " The Garden in Summer," " The 
Flowers of FaU," " FaU Work in the Garden," 
and " The Winter Window-Garden," embrace 
others that come under none of these headings 
and are apparently in no special order of 
arrangement ; nor is winter in the out-door

garden considered at all, save very incidentally. 
In other words, the book is not what its title 
might indicate — a guide to the seasons in their 
order. It is likely to be most serviceable to 
beginners in garden-making. The author's 
language is simple, his style is popular, and he 
gives facts and instruction in an easily under- 
stood form. Especially on such subjects as 
lawns, flower-beds, back-yard gardens, window- 
boxes, the growing of bulbs, etc., the book 
will be helpful and suggestive. The chapter 
on "A Garden of Native Plants" suggests 
some of the lovely shrubs, vines, and plants that 
can be secured to beautify even the smallest 
garden. To many city dwellers, accustomed to 
make a garden only of bedding-plants, these 
hints will come as a revelation. Possibly an 
undue share of attention is given to in-door 
gardening, but the chapters on " The Culture 
and Care of Palms " and " The Use of Growing 
Plants for Table Decoration " will no doubt 
prove very useful in helping to provide floral 
decorations for the table. Two chapters on 
"Rural and Village Improvement Societies," 
which should be read by men as well as women, 
close the book. There is a colored frontispiece, 
also twenty-six other illustrations from photo- 
graphs ; and the volimie is presented in some- 
thing of a gift-book form, by means of decorated 
end-papers and title-pages, embellished with 
numerous excerpts from the poets. There is 
also a good index. 

A wholly different type of work, — in fact, 
so far as we know, something really new in 
this now wide field, — is Mrs. Mabel Cabot 
Sedgwick's " The Garden Month by Month." 
This really does take up, not garden work, 
but the garden denizens, according to each 
month in which they appear in the greater part 
of the United States. The floral year, taking 
the vicinity of Boston as the standard, is made 
to begin with March and end with September. 
The scope of the information is denoted on the 
title-page as " describing the appearance, color, 
dates of bloom, and cultivation, of all desirable 
hardy plants for the formal or wild garden, 
with additional lists of aquatics, vines, etc." 
This is not distinctively a reading book, to be 
enjoyed in an easy-chair while the imaginative 
gardener plans his next year's accomplishments, 
or dreams of a paradise that he may never 
have, — rather, it is a reference book, present- 
ing much information in tabular form, with 
illustrations intended as an assistance to the 
text, whose pages will be a guide to those who 
might be misled by florists' and seedmen's 



catalogues and to readers of books that abound 
in unfamiliar names. The inclusion of a color- 
chart is a new feature, and shows that the author 
justly considers color-effects the most important 
thing to be considered when planning a garden. 
Another distinctive feature of the book is that 
it confines itself to hardy perennials (and a few 
tender ones), the annuals having been omitted 
because of their varying season of bloom. Never- 
theless, if the supplementary list of fifty desir- 
able annuals had been classified according to 
color also, it would be of undoubted assistance 
to the beginner who takes this book as a guide. 
The color-chart is so painstaking, with so many 
minute gradations, that it is worthy of special 
mention ; inasmuch as the listed flowers, as 
stated in the preface, have nearly all been 
carefully verified by the chart. The author 
modestly disclaims perfection in this feature, 
while feeling that her chart is probably as 
accurate as any that can be made. This is 
doubtless the case ; but it only goes to show 
anew that color resides in the eye of the 
beholder, for several instances could be cited 
where the color-sense of the author and that of 
the reviewer do not quite agree. The illus- 
trations, as has been said, are intended for ser- 
vice rather than for beauty merely, and many 
of them reaUy fulfil this purpose, yet there are 
a number that ai'e not of sufficiently sharp out- 
line to enable one unfamiliar with the flower 
to picture it plainly to himself. The tabular 
arrangement is by color (which includes the 
popular description and a nmnbered reference 
to the chart), by English name, botanical name 
and synonyms, description (with hints on cul- 
tivation, etc.), height, situation, and time of 
bloom. The appendix includes, besides the 
lists mentioned on the title-page, bog-garden 
or marsh plants, plants conspicuous for their 
foliage, a few of the best ferns, and some minor 
supplementary lists. The index is fuU and 
carefully made. Altogether, this is a most 
valuable book for the shelves devoted to one's 
garden library, in a location handy for reference.

Dramas of the Wild.* 



The opening summer, with all its other 
allurements, offers us an absorbing drama of 
wild life, if we will but place ourselves in the 
audience of the discerning. To do this is not 
difficult, since the stage is everywhere except 
on city streets, and the conditions of seeing 
some part of the play are only a little time, 
patience, and desire. But the drama grows in 
intensity as it draws farther away from centres 
of human life, and the conditions of witnessing 
it become less easy of fulfilment, so that even 
if our desire is great most of us miss the su- 
premely thrilling scenes and must learn of them 
by hearsay. 

It is impossible not to envy Mr. Charles G. D. 
Roberts the freedom of this out-door theatre 
which years of devoted attendance have given 
him ; but the envy gives place to gratitude, 
after all, for the competence with which he 
makes us see what we could not have seen for 
ourselves. His collection of stories just now 
published imder the fascinating title " The 
Haunters of the Silences " reports with skill 
and vividness dramas of wild life beyond the 
range of ordinary observation, where the prim- 
itive instincts of the brute play their tragedy 
against a spacious and lonely background which 
tremendously enhances the significance of every 
action. " In the ancient wUd," he writes, " there 
were three great silences which held their habi- 
tation unassailed. They were the silence of the 
deep of the lake, the silence of the dark heart 
of the cedar swamp, and the silence of the upper 
air, high above the splintered peak of the 
mountain." There is the silence, too, of the 
far frozen north, and the darkness and silenee 
of the sea, whose depth Mr. Roberts confesses 
he has not penetrated, but whose secrets he at 
least cleverly approximates. 

Wrapped in the mystery of such surround- 
ings, even hunger and bestial hate and lust of 
blood become tolerable dramatic forces, admissi- 
ble for their very grimness and power. One re- 
sponds in spite of himself to the glory of combat 
when the polar bear feels the slash of the wal- 
rus's mighty tusks, or in the deep-sea battles for 
life with the narwhal. (Is it not, by the way, 
an addition to ordinary knowledge of the polar

bear that he is a masterly swimmer and diver?) 
There is no escaping sympathy for such heroic 
failures as those of the drake whose flight is cut 
short by the " terror of the air," or of the king 
salmon whose repeated efforts to leap the falls 
leave him torn and bleeding on the rocks below. 
Mr. Roberts has a sense of the continuity of the 
struggle which is almost new, and which some- 
times carries these plays into a third or fourth 
act. The shrew-mole (for the dramatis perso7icB 
are not all of large proportions) that kills the 
black snake is himself killed by the fox, and 
the mink that catches mice is caught by an 
eagle. Man appears sometimes as the benefi- 
ciary of this chain of fate, sometimes as himself 
the deus salvator. A mariner is imprisoned on 
his wrecked boat by a shark, and is unable to 
dive even for a pole to hoist his signal of 
distress, until a sword-fish mercifully — for 
the man — cuts the shark in two. And, most 
tremendous and grewsome of all, a diver caught 
in the toils of a devil-fish in the dark caverns 
of the sea, — "a colossal, swollen, leprous- 
looking bulk, spotted and pallid," with huge 
tentacles that seem to grow with every cut 
given them, — is saved by the providential 
intervention of a killer whale. Stories of 
horses, deer, bear, lynx, and beaver, and a 
most delicious tale of an ant imprisoned in a 
pitcher-plant, complete the volume. The end- 
ing is not always tragedy. Even man, who is 
too likely to play the part of the villain when 
an animal is the hero, is shown to be capable 
of pity and of justice. A more satisfactory 
resolution of the conflict between human and 
sub-human interests has seldom been given than 
in the story of the himter who traps a lynx, but 
later is obliged to accept the lynx's help against 
a pack of wolves, and so gives the animal his 
well-earned liberty. For this large-minded 
fairness, as well as for the other reasons sug- 
gested, the book belongs to the small but 
fortunately growing class of the best nature 
story-books. It is praise enough of Mr. Bull's 
spirited illustrations that they help rather than 
hinder the imagination, even with the most 
difficult subjects. 

In contrast to the vigorous movement of these 
pieces. Dr. Madden's " Forest Friends " fur- 
nishes a good example of the static drama. It 
fills a real need in supplying a record of the 
animal life of regions near at hand in the early 
days of man's occupation. A boy of seven, the 
author settled with his parents on the shores of 
Lake Michigan in the time of the " uncleared 
forest, the unbroken soil," and set about mak- 



370

[June 16, 



ing friends with the forest itself, and with the 
gentler classes of its inhabitants. He was soon, 
with no other stimulus than his natural bent, in 
" thorough sympathy with nature, a sympathy 
which makes living worth so much more, and 
which always furnishes a happy relaxation from 
the more sordid, hard, material cares of life." 
A deer runway near the pioneer's cabin was the 
most potent factor in this sympathetic educa- 
tion, and the yomig nature-lover soon began to 
feel that " a day upon which a deer is seen is 
better than another day," and to do what he 
could to save the beautiful creatures from being 
run into the lake by a brutal dog and there 
murdered (there was no other word) by the 
dogs more brutal master. Foxes, squirrels, 
rabbits, birds, and even bears, came in for their 
share of the boy's friendly curiosity ; while 
wolf, lynx, and on one memorable night a pan- 
ther, supplied the element of fear. If Mr. 
Madden does not attempt to enhance the situa- 
tion with any tense exercise of dramatic art, he 
at least catches the significance of what he sees, 
and sets forth interesting facts. For example, 
of the osprey he writes : 

" The gentlest of all birds of prey is the osprey 
fisherman. The most timid and least capable of self- 
protection among the song birds did not fear him, spar- 
rows, warblers, and other small birds alighting on his 
very nest when he was at home, and sitting on the 
same branch with him when he rested after a hard task 
at fishing," 

And for Chicagoans these statistics bear a moral: 

" The immense numbers of birds [passenger pigeons] 
destroyed here were killed and captured for shipment 
to Chicago. . . . During this time [from March to 
August] there were sent to Chicago on an average 
12,500 dead birds daily, making a total of 1,500,000 
for the whole summer and 80,352 live birds shipped by 
rail alone. Add to these figures the numbers that were 
disposed of otherwise, the numbers of yoimg which 
rotted in their nests, the parents having been caught 
and killed, and the total could not have been less than 
1,000,000,000." 

Again the reader is conscious of a pang of envy 
for a life so free and eventfid as that once 
near us, and is ready to echo Thoreau's wish 
that his " neighbors were wilder." Suppose 
there were still a place within easy reach where 
any day one might see " a big bear, a panther, 
a lynx, a wild cat, a hungry wolf, or several of 
them," how much city folks might vary and 
enrich their lives, and " nature-alize " themselves 
by visits to such a spot ! 

Mr. McGaffey's little volume, " Outdoors," 
brings some comfort in the fact that there are 
still dramas in miniature played near at hand 
by creatures of our common experience. But 



unfortimately the newspaper sketches which 
compose the book present the man with the 
gun as the hero of most of these dramas, and 
game birds and the lesser animals as the victims. 
The wi'iter is capable of better things ; for in 
speaking of the winter woods he says : " The 
philosophy and inner revealments of snow- 
enveloped woods are not to be enjoyed with a 
gun. If you bring the gun along the hunter's 
instinct will urge you on, and some things will 
escape you." Why not apply this discovery to 
other seasons in the year, when the preponder- 
ance of things to see over those of winter is 
certainly as great as the preponderance of temp- 
tations to shoot? The advice to sportsmen 
which the book contains is not full enough or 
new enough to compensate for the disappoint- 
ment this point of view causes the nature-lover. 
Nevertheless, Mr. McGaffey's appreciation of 
the background of these naturalistic plays in 
one act is so delicate and often so poetically 
worded as to gain him grateful acknowledg- 
ment. The marshes in April are to him an 
epitome of the year's loneliness, where " above 
the reeds there is a level sea of silence," broken 
occasionally when a lone teal scurries past, 
" the very sense of music in his flight, the least 
possible crisping of the air to mark his sym- 
metrical course." An equally delicate sense of 
action against this background leads him to say 
of the flight of common birds that " observation 
and experience will give one the power to read 
the channels and winding aisles of light and 
air as a book's pages may be scanned," and 
that " bird-flight is the warp and woof of the 
seasons, spun in the wind's looms, visible as it' 
passes, yet fading as it is seen." There is a 
quick sense of character, too, which promises 
well for what Mr. McGaffey wiU do when he 
ceases to write, as it were, gun in hand. 
From the woman who fishes " in a bewilder- 
ingly attractive costiune that ought to reconcile 
the fish to their fate," to the woodchuck who 
sits on his burrow " ruminating on the perfidy 
of man," each actor that passes over the stage 
has suggestive possibilities. 

The three books in our present group strik- 
ingly bring out the fact, pertinent to some cur- 
rent newspaper discussion, that the man who 
goes to the woods to learn gets more permanent 
value, both for himself and others, than the man 
who goes to himt. The steel-cold click of the 
hunter's gun sounds in all his facts, because he 
has shown disrespect for the greatest fact of aU 
— life. Even a little romancing is preferable to 
that. But there is no real danger of romancing.

Travels Far and Near.* 



" With Fancy unfurled, I can go round the world 
by the old Marlboro road," boastfully sang Thoreau. 
With more truth the reader of books of travel can 
assert that he, with Fancy unfurled, with the spirit 
of the wandering foot and the devouring eye, can 
go round the world at his own fireside. In his 
imagination he may go out of his country and out 
of himself ; he may climb mountains, cross deserts, 
visit Prester John's country, meet strange people, 
hunt savage animals, and saunter amid bewitching 
scenes, — do all these things without the discom- 
forts and inconveniences that may weary the flesh 
in much actual travelling. For such travellers our 
present group of books offers an unusually attractive 
invitation to travel across four continents, to meet 
all sorts and conditions of men, and to see how the 
world wags beyond their own hearthstones. All of 
the volumes aim to combine entertainment with their 
varied store of information, and all have the added 
charm of illustrations. 

One of the most fascinating books of travel which 
we have read in several years is entitled " The 
Desert and the Sown." The author, Miss Gertrude 
Lowthian Bell, made the trip through Syria, from 
Jerusalem to Alexandretta, and up into Asia Minor, 
alone save for her Arab attendants. Her volume 
recounts, however, only that part of her journey to 
Alexandretta along the

As Miss Bell has an acute knowledge of the people 
and of their language, " the fine and subtle tongue, 
the Modern Syriac Arabic," obtained by previous 
travel and experience in the Moslem East, her book 
is more than the note-book of the casual traveller. 
She is not unmindful of the political conditions 
existing there under Turkish rule, and, being En- 
glish, very serenely suggests that were Syria under 
British pi-otection political matters there would be 
vastly bettered. Such, too, seems to be the opinion 
of the hard-pressed native. But interesting as the 
political gossip was to Miss Bell, she is manifestly 
more interested in the people, the sons of the desert, 
whom she met at their lowly occupations, at the 
market-place, and in their natural unspoilt diver- 
sions. To her, a camel-driver, an old sheikh, a 
water-seller, a market-place, a little-known temple, 
a far-from-the-path convent, a fragment of an entab- 
lature, an exchange of talk between herself and a 
native about some half-forgotten lore or ancient 
tradition of the desert, are more attractive than the 
affairs of nations, and even more enticing than 
the better-known places — Damascus, for instance, 
which she treats as a passing phase of desert travel 
less interesting than a native village. Page after 
page in the book offers tempting bits for quotation, 
some little scene that brings the heart of the desert 
home to the reader, — such a scene, for example, 
as a deal in corn between natives, where, " but for 
my incongruous presence, and the lapse of a few 
thousand years, they might have been the sons of 
Jacob come down into Egypt to bicker over the 
weight of sacks with their brother Joseph." Or, 
what is probably more uniquely pleasing in the 
book, we should like to quote, did our space permit, 
many pages of lively conversation held with the 
natives, pages that reveal the speaking Arab, such 
talk as one seldom finds in books of travel. But 
on the whole Miss BeU's book is too uniformly good 
to reveal much in a quotation ; it must be read in 
its entirety to be appreciated. The author has made 
a distinct contribution to the literature of travel, 
and has put her name far up on the list of women 
who have written good travel-books. 

Mr. Frederic Courtland Penfield's volume en- 
titled " East of Suez," with the auxiliary notation, 
"Ceylon, India, China, and Japan," is a book of 
detached sketches, which treat of such varied 
topics as the Suez Canal, Pearl Fishing in the Gulf 
of Manar, Bombay, a visit to the palace of the 
Maharajah of Jeypore, a description of the Taj 
Mahal, Benares, Calcutta, Penang (the portal which 
separates "The East" from "The Far East"), 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Canton ("the most satis- 
fying, fascinating, and puzzling city in the Orient, 
if not in the whole world"), Macao (the tiny Por- 
tuguese colony which plays the part of an Oriental 
Monte Carlo), Japan's Commercial Future, and the 
Kaiser's play for Chinese trade. These topics Mr. 
Penfield treats in a most entertaining manner ; for 
he is gifted to an unusual degree with a discerning

eye, and has the happy faculty of enlivening his 
descriptions with a quickening humor and a sym- 
pathetic spirit. But the author prides himself more 
on the fact that his volume is a " purpose " book of 
travels, a " book of journeyings loaded with gentle 
preachment." The gist of his purpose lies in his 
plea for a judicious and systematic campaign on the 
part of our government and our commercial giants 
for a larger share in the trade of the world, for by 
this only can we hope to compete successfully with 
Germany and Japan for Oriental commerce, and, 
incidentally, to make our Panama Canal a formida^ 
ble competitor with the Suez Canal. 

" What the American, zigzagging up and down and across 
that boundless region spoken of as ' East of Suez,' fails to see 
is the product of Uncle Sam's mills, workshops, mines, and 
farms. From the moment he passes the Suez Canal to his 
arrival at Hong Kong or Yokohama, the Stars and Stripes 
are discovered in no harbor nor upon any sea ; and maybe he 
sees the emblem of the great republic not once in the transit 
of the Pacific. And the products of our marvellous country 
are met but seldom, if at all, where the American wanders in 
the East. He is rewarded by finding that the light of Asia 
is American petroleum, but that is about the only Western 
commodity he is sure of encountering in months of travel." 

This indictment, if it may be so called, is to be 
met, Mr. Penfield insists, by a radical liberalizing of 
our marine law ; that is, our government must sub- 
sidize our merchant marine coincidently with the 
building of the Panama Canal. Then, and not until 
then, shall we be able to compete with the Kaiser, 
whom the author not infelicitously styles " Trade- 
Lord William." Lack of space precludes our giving 
an adequate discussion of the many excellent fea- 
tures of this notable book. Few books of travel 
lately written in this country excel it, and we pre- 
dict it will be more than a book of an hour. 

Mr. Perceval Landon's " Under the Sun," al- 
though a book about India, is by no means one of 
bald facts about that country. The author does not 
give a summary of mere historical data about the 
diverse social, political, and religious activities of 
India ; he does not give the statistics of deaths 
from starvation, snake bites, and the ravages of wild 
animals ; he makes no adventitious arguments con- 
cerning the conflicts between the native and the 
English governments ; he does not concern himself 
unduly with the peculiar religious beliefs of the 
natives ; and, finally, he boldly asserts that his book 
is not a record of the late tour of the Prince of 
Wales, nor is it in any sense a guide-book. It is 
intended rather for those who have already travelled 
in India, or who know India through an extended 
course of reading. Mr. Landon, whose knowledge 
of that country is based on a series of " annual 
wanderings " through it, purposes to indicate " the 
widely different local colour that distinguishes one 
Indian city from another," to make an impression- 
istic picture of Indian life and travel which will 
supplement the usual books of description and 
information. Many of his narratives of famous per- 
sons and events — like that which gives the hitherto 
incomplete story of Nana Sahib and the great Indian 
mutiny of just a half -century ago, and of Scindia, 



" the most remarkable character in all India," are 
of thrilling interest. The volume is handsomely 
illustrated and attractively printed. 

A reader of Mr. Landon's book who fails to get 
a correct orientation of India and of its complex 
life may readily find his bearings by reading Mr. 
Sidney Low's " Vision of India." Mr, Low gathered 
his materials during the progress of the Prince and 
the Princess of Wales through India, on which occa- 
sion he was the special correspondent of a London 
journal. " It has been my aim," says Mr. Low, 
" to reproduce something of the impression which 
our vast and varied dominion of the East — almost 
a world in itself — leaves on the mind, in its 
splendour and its contradictions, its colour and its 
mystery, its wealth and its poverty, its medley of 
classes, creeds, and peoples : to hint at a few of the 
absorbing problems suggested by the contemplation 
of this strange and fascinating amalgam." The 
volume is a study in the contrasts between the Old 
and the New India — the India of the Native and 
of the English ; of gold and rags ; of places, sacred 
and profane ; of the virtuous and the unvirtuous 
Maharajahs ; of the old gods and the new spirit; 
of Siva and the locomotive engine ; of Kali and 
modern electricity, and of the conflict between 
modern inventions in general and the ancient social 
and religious customs of the country. Out of this 
abundant material Mr. Low has written a book so 
profitably full and accm-ate, so acute in observation, 
and 80 enlivening, that it may be called a remark- 
ably illuminating book about India. That it has 
received commendatory notice from such high 
authorities as Lord Curzon and Mr. John Morley 
speaks much for the author's qualities as an 
observer and writer. 

Mr. Albert B. Lloyd has labored as a missionary 
for ten years in the northern and the western parts 
of the Uganda Protectorate in Africa, during which 
time he has had two furloughs to England, and on 
th6 occasion of each visit he has published a volume 
bearing on his life and work in Africa. His recent 
residence of five years was, for the most part, in 
the remote and little known Acholi country ; and it 
is of this region that his volume entitled " Uganda 
to Khartoum" has to do. Although Mr. Lloyd's 
primary interest in Africa was his missionary work, 
an interest which is manifest everywhere in his 
writings, that feature does not overburden his vol- 
ume. He is a missionary who takes out a big-game 
hunter's license, and who, moreover, bags his full 
quota of game both big and small, in order to feed 
the natives and to reduce his expense account as 
well. Few books describing sport in Africa contain 
more thrilling tales than this one. On his return 
trip to England, Mr. Lloyd passed down the Nile, 
a distance of 1150 miles, through the gi-eat marshes 
that drain the life-giving waters before they reach 
the Soudan. Sir William Gerstin's scheme of con- 
serving the water by moving the whole of the Nile 
bed fifty or sixty miles to the east, to an entirely 
new channel more than two hundred miles long.

thereby turning the main stream away from the 
great sudd-covered marshes, will, according to Mr. 
Lloyd, make the Soudan a veritable garden-spot. 
Alike for readers interested in missionary work in 
Africa, and for those interested in it as a land of 
adventure, Mr, Lloyd's book will be satisfactory. 

The book on " Portuguese East Africa," by Mr. 
R. C. F. Maugham, H. B. M. Consul for the dis- 
tricts of Mosambique and Zambesia, and for the 
territory of Manica and Sofala, sketches in an 
unusually entertaining and instructive way the his- 
tory, scenery, big-game hunting, and native life, in 
the supposed legendary land of Ophir, the treasure- 
land of King Solomon. The opening chapters deal 
with the history of Portuguese colonization in East 
Africa and with the establishment of colonial gov- 
ernment there under the guidance of the Mosam- 
bique Company — two items of interest that have 
hitherto received inadequate attention from writers 
on Africa. But the greater part of the book is con- 
cerned with big-game hunting in that district. As 
that part of Africa, before the disastrous visitation 
of the rinderpest in 1896, had more varieties and 
greater abundance of big game than did almost any 
other region, Mr. Maugham was fortunate in being 
able to explore it and hunt through it in its earlier 
state. As far as the natives are concerned, the 
author agrees with the local government in deplor- 
ing the efforts of zealous Europeans to educate them 
above their rank. "The negro," argues the writer, 
"was sent into the woi-ld for an end, and for one 
end only — namely, manual labor." It must be a 
satisfaction to be thus in the Creator's confidence. 
Of the country itself, the author is of the opinion 
that when the demon of malaria is checked by 
making Europeans immune to its evU effects, then 
Portuguese East Africa, an exquisite fairy-like land, 
will offer one long round of interest and delight to 
visiting Europeans. As Mr. Maugham has more 
than ordinary skill in narration and description, his 
book will interest the casual as well as the confirmed 
reader of records of travel. 

In his trips to various corners of the earth, Mr. 
Michael Myers Shoemaker has been accustomed to 
travelling in a rather leisurely manner ; but in his 
latest book, " Winged Wheels in France," he whisks 
us thi'ough a five thousand mile journey in a twenty- 
four horse-power motor-car at the rate of forty-five 
miles an hour. We begin our trip with him at 
Nice, and go through Provence to Aix, where we 
catch a glimpse of the castle and the story of 
King Ren^, thence to Aries, Narbonne, Carcassonne, 
Lourdes (the city of miracles), Pau, and on to 
restful Birratz before we go speeding into Spain. 
From Spain we run into central France in search 
of the unique and the fantastic. Touraine, Anjou, 
Brittany, Normandy, Picardy, come in quick suc- 
cession ; and finally Paris is reached, a city where 
an automobile is more of a necessity than a luxury 
for one who wishes to explore the environs of the 
city. We glide from France through the moun- 
tains of the Vosges into the Rhine Valley, over the 



Col de la Schlucht to Freiburg, ^to the Black Forest, 
thence into Switzerland, to Geneva, and finally to 
Aix-les-Bains, where we finish our delightful but 
breath-taking journey with Mr. Shoemaker. He 
is always interesting and entertaining in his books, 
but we prefer him when he travels at more leisure 
than the motor-car permits. The volume is pleas- 
antly written and admirably illustrated. 

A very readable and not unprofitable book is 
Mr. W. D. McCrackan's "The Italian Lakes." 
The author informs us, in his sub-title, that his 
volume is the " record of pilgrimages to familar 
and unfamiliar places of the ' lakes of azure, lakes 
of leisure,' together with a description of their quaint 
towns and villa gardens and the treasures of their 
art and history." He takes us in leisurely fashion 
from Pallanza to Solferino and among the famous 
lakes, sketching the varied scenery of Lake Come, 
the seclusion of the lake of Iseo, the charms of 
Maggiore, the emerald recesses of Lugano, and the 
special attractions of all the sub-Alpine lakes both 
large and small. In the background of his sketches 
the author traces the human interest which has 
enlivened the history of the region ; we feel the 
presences of Virgil, Dante, CatvQlus, Garibaldi, 
Mazzini, Cavour, Goethe, Lady Mary Wortley 
Montagu, Ruskin, Manzoni, Stoppani, Donizetti, 
and other famous personages whose names are 
associated with the Italian lakes. To some of the 
commoner and more modern themes, — such as the 
quaint costumes of the Brianza peasant women, the 
silk-worm culture, lemon culture, etc., — the author 
gives due consideration. While in no sense a guide- 
book, this little volume will be very acceptable to 
travellers intending to visit any of the Italian lakes. 

After taking many incurious glances at Portugal 
on his various flittings through that country, Mr. 
Mai'tin Hume determined to overcome his ingrained 
prejudices against the " Garden by the Sea " by 
seeking a more intimate knowledge of the land and 
of the people. His volume entitled " Through 
Portugal " is, he tells us, " a self-prescribed penance 
for my former injustice toward the most beautiful 
country and the most unspoilt and courteous peas- 
antry in Southern Europe "; and his sojourn in the 
land of which he writes was " a continual and un- 
adulterated delight from beginning to end, bringing 
refreshment and renewed vigor of soul, mind, and 
body, opening to my eyes, though they had seen 
much of the world, prospects of beauty unsurpassed 
in my experience, and revealing objects of antiqua- 
rian and artistic interest unsuspected by those to 
whom the attractions of the regular round of Euro- 
pean travel have grown flat and familiar," What- 
ever Mr. Hume describes in and about Oporto, 
Bussaco, Coimbra, Alcobaga, Cintra, Lisbon, or 
places of lesser note, is done with a well-considered 
and creditable enthusiasm, and in an unusually 
graceful style. The publishers have added to the 
writer's stimulating descriptions a goodly number of 
pleasing color-prints that contribute much to the 
attractiveness of the volume.

Mr. William Seymour Edwards, in his book en- 
titled " In the Mexican Highlands," tells about his 
trip into the mountain regions of Mexico, and also 
gives fla,shHght glimpses of New Orleans, Vera Cruz, 
and Havana. His book is enlivened with pictures 
of wayside scenes, theatres, cafds, a bull-fight, a 
trip to the Mexican mines, and other odds and ends 
in the life of our neighbors over the southern border 
and in Cuba. The Mexicans struck him as intelli- 
gent and progressive, both in affairs of government 
and business. The Cubans impressed him as being 
over-zealous in their desire for liberty, — in fact, as 
somewhat revolutionary in disposition against our 
paternal government. 

Few regions of the world have more wonderfully 
picturesque and romantic scenery to offer to the 
traveller than has the southwestern part of the 
United States, in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon 
of the Colorado. It is of this region, with its 
matchless vision of natural beauty, its prehistoric 
ruins, and its unique present-day cliff-dwellers, that 
Dr. T. Mitchell Prudden writes in his readable little 
volume entitled " On the Great American Plateau." 
As befits such a land. Dr. Prudden's methods of 
travelling are of the leisurely sort, — with his own 
pack-train and camp equipment. Incidentally in 
his book he makes a vigorous plea for the protection 
of the natives, for the careful gathering of their 
legends, and for the stopping of the unbridled 
vandalism which is fast devastating the ruins of 
the ancient cliff-dwellers. Only too soon, the author 
assures us, wUl the natives cease sending messages 
to the gods by rattlesnakes, if some adequate pro- 
tection is not provided against the onslaught of semi- 
civilization with its attendant evils. Dr. Prudden's 
style is notably vigorous and enthusiastic. 

Mr. Harry De Windt, the experienced traveller 
and well-known author of many readable books of 
travel, journeyed as a newspaper correspondent 
through Montenegro, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Servia, 
Bulgaria, Roumania, Southern Russia, and the Cau- 
casus, in the order named. He recounts his trip 
and records his observations in the volume entitled 
" Through Savage Europe," the title accurately 
describing the " wild and lawless countries between 
the Adriatic and Black Seas." Montenegro, says 
the author, has the advantage of a good ruler in 
Prince Nicholas ; Herzegovina and Bosnia prosper 
under Austrian rule; Servia, to which a major part 
of the book is devoted, attempts to rule itself with 
but little success. Mr. De Windt takes particular 
pains to have the reader understand that King Peter 
of Servia should be back in Paris playing the part 
of a boulevardier rather than attempting to fill the 
throne of Servia, and that the murdered King Alex- 
ander was a man competent to rule so volatUe 
a people. For the regicides — the author unknow- 
ingly was entertained by one of them — he has the 
utmost contempt. Bulgaria, which Mr. De Windt 
well calls '' the land of unrest," impressed him as 
a factor to be weighed when considering Balkan 
matters. Very fittingly, Mr. De Windt's interesting 



book ends with his trip into Russia, where he saw 
the red flag of anarchy wave in the riot at Odessa. 
The distinctive merit of this book lies in the fact 
that the author visited these same countries a gener- 
ation ago, and consequently is competent to gauge 
the various lines of progress made in these ever- 
changing hot-beds of European discord. 

No story in the history of modern exploration is 
more pathetic than that of the death of Leonidas 
Hubbard, Jr., in the forsaken and dead land of Lab- 
rador. In the summer of 1903 an expedition led by 
Hubbard attempted to reach Lake Michikamau by 
ascending the Nascaupee River, but, missing their 
route, the party wandered about for two months 
without reaching the lake. On the return journey, 
Hubbard died of starvation, leaving his two compan- 
ions, Mr. Dillon Wallace and a half-breed Indian, 
to struggle back to civilization. Of that disastrous 
expedition Mr. Wallace has written in another vol- 
ume. In his present book, entitled "The Long 
Labrador Trail," Mr. Wallace tells how he fulfilled 
the compact with Hubbard " that in case one of us 
fall the other would carry to completion the explo- 
ratory work that he had planned and begun." To 
trace Mr. Wallace's route through the waste lands 
of Labrador would serve but in a small way to indi- 
cate the valuable account of his heroic endeavor to 
fulfil the wish of his friend. His party reached the 
sought-for lake, where, on account of the short food 
supply, all of its members save the author and a 
companion returned home ; the advance party, how- 
ever, penetrated Labrador, reaching Fort Chimo, 
and finally returned in mid-winter to Hamilton 
Inlet, after a journey with dogs, komatik, and snow- 
shoes, of two thousand miles. Few readers of Mr. 
Wallace's volume will be interested in the scientific 
data gathered by the party, but none can fail to 
enjoy the author's accovmt of his expedition, and to 
applaud the noble incentive that led him to return 
to bleak Labrador to carry out the plans of his 
former companion. jj. E. Coblentz. 



Mr. Andrew Lang's praise of Professor Raleigh is 
whole-hearted, and in striking contrast with certain 
other critics' dispraise of the accomplished author of the 
latest Shakespeare biography and study. " This work," 
writes Mr. Lang, " is one of the series of English Men 
of Letters, but it shines among the others like the moon 
among the stars. Mr. Raleigh has little to say about 
Sidney Lee, nothing about Miss Corelli, nothing about 
the gifted Bacon. His theme is the poet Shakespeare; 
the poet rather than the man, though the man, too, is 
happily adumbrated, on the evidence of his works, and 
of tradition. The book is a delightful treatise on poetry, 
with no pryings about Mr. W. H., and no pedantries 
about anything. . . . Mr. Raleigh must be an unique 
professor of English literature ! " Few indeed are the 
teachers of English Uterature who are so peculiarly 
fitted for their task (though task is the wrong word) as 
to deserve no part of the censure implied in Leslie 
Stephen's ascription of his early interest in his country's 
classics to the fact that, in his college days, English 
studies had not gained admission to the curriculum.

Recent Fiction.* 



When " Joseph Vance " swam into the ken of 
novel-readers a few months ago there were many of 
us who felt that we could realize for the first time 
in our own experience what it was to have lived in 
the days of " Pickwick " and " Pendennis." It was 
far and away the best novel of the year, and of 
many years ; its excellence, moreover, was of the 
specific sort that is associated with the Mid- Victorian 
age of fiction rather than of the sort to which the 
popular modern novelist aspires. It was evident that 
the author was a man steeped in the best traditions 
of the older fiction, though none the less a man now 
living in the twentieth century and responsive to 
the currents of its thought. His advanced age 
was suflicient to account for this phenomenon ; but 
nothing short of native genius could account for 
the rich geniality of this first product of a septua- 
genarian. Mr. De Morgan's second novel, now 
following fast upon the heels of its predecessor, 
proves to be a work no less remarkable, and one 
equally productive of almost unalloyed delight. It 
is also a work of the same soul-satisfying length, 
and the reader who has acquired in self-defence the 
habit of rapid reading is hereby warned that if he 
skims " Alice-for-Short " it will be to his own serious 
loss. To emphasize the metaphor, we will say that 
the cream reaches to the dregs, and is not the super- 
imposed covering of a sub-stratum of watery fluid. 
"We make t-he acquaintance of Alice at the age of 
six, and her story, in one sense, is of the simplest. 
The child of a drunken couple, caretakers of a 
decayed Soho house that was once a mansion and 
now provides quarters for artist folk and tradesmen, 
she makes her entry upon the scene as the central 
figure in a cruche cassSe episode, which brings her

ignored both her existence and that of the " exten- 
sive basement with cellarage," which is her home. 
In other words, she drops the jug of beer Avhich 
she is fetching from the public house, and is con- 
soled in her plight by Mr. Charles Heath, amateur 
artist, who inhabits a " studio " in the Soho house 
The young man in question (and this is much to 
the point) is the son of well-to-do parents who live 
in Hyde Park Gardens, and who, contrary to all 
traditions, countenance and even encourage their 
son in his misguided ambition. Presently, the 
child's parents engage in a drunken quarrel which 
ends disastrously to both. The man deals his wife 
a murderous blow with the first convenient imple- 
ment (which chances to be a hammer), and then, 
realizing what he has done, ends his own life with 
a dose of cyanide. This makes an orphan of Alice, 
and her " first floor " friend and protector sees noth- 
ing for it but to take the child to his own home and 
turn her over to his adored and adorable sister. In 
her new environment, the child occupies a tentative 
status for a while, but proves so winning that she 
soon becomes a permanent fixture in the household. 
During the ensuing two years, the adorable sister 
meets and weds a rising young physician, and her 
brother, enticed into the web of a young woman 
of dubious extraction (just then serving him as a 
model), rashly makes her his wife. At this junc- 
ture, sixteen years are permitted to elapse, and when 
we have recovered from the bewilderment occasioned 
by the leap, we learn that the young physician has 
become a famous alienist and a leader of his pro- 
fession, that Charles has discovered his mistake and 
divorced his faithless wife, and that Alice has grown 
up to be just what we have a right to expect — one 
of the most lovable creatures to whom a novelist 
ever gave the breath of life. Of course Charles 
and Alice are meant for one another, but each is 
so absurdly afraid that the other's motive would be 
self-sacrifice rather than the love that ought to bind 
husband and wife that it is a long while before the 
critical moment is reached when their mutual devo- 
tion of friendship is discovered to be inadequate, 
and their relation becomes what it should have 
been long before. Thus the story, after much delay 
(against which protest would be ungrateful indeed), 
ends happily. But although the above is its essen- 
tial outline, a good half of the stor^ is as yet 
unsketched. The title-page describes it as " a 
dichronism," and thereby hangs another aspect of 
the tale. The old Soho house has a past, a past 
compounded of love and hatred and gi'im tragedy, 
and remotely related to Alice herself. Glimpses 
of this past are vouchsafed us during the years of 
Alice's childhood. A mysterious jewelled ring is 
discovered, some old portraits offer elusive hints, 
several ghosts make casual appearances in the liouse, 
and the skeleton of a murdered woman is disinterred 
in the cellar. No solution of these mysteries is 
offered until many years afterwards, when they are 
half-forgotten, and then, by means of recovered

documents, and particularly by the revelations of 
an old woman, restored to sanity by an operation 
after sixtyyears of aphasia as an inmate of Bedlam, 
the whole complication is pieced together, and we 
get a fairly connected history, stretching back as 
far as the early eighteenth century, apd involving 
the fortunes of Alice's forbears. It makes a story 
of extraordinary interest, although its demands upon 
the constructive imagination are severe. And we 
cannot quite forgive the author for his ghosts, 
which are not really needed, and which are left 
unrationalized — just ghosts and nothing more. A 
carping critic might possibly find fm'ther causes 
for offence in the overplus of sentimentality which 
marks the book, and in the garrulity of its narra- 
tion, for the writer, after the manner of his com- 
peers from Fielding to Thackeray, cares little for 
the details of construction, and makes any kind of 
an excursus whenever he pleases, discoursing easily 
upon art and human natm-e to the impediment of 
all orderly progress. But only a crabbed partisan 
of the formal could place his hand upon his heart 
and sincerely aver that he would willingly spare 
any of these irrelevancies. They add salt and 
savour to a novel which even without them would 
be reckoned a remarkable example of the art of 
fiction at its noblest. Finally, we may make a sug- 
gestion that has delightful possibilities. "Joseph 
Vance" and " Alice-f or-Short " are novels contain- 
ing each something like a quainter of a million 
words. Such books are in one sense the products 
of a lifetime, and even in the most literal sense are 
not written in a day or a year. May it not be that 
their author has been writing books of this kind for 
longer than we fancy, and that he has stores of 
accumulated manuscript that may yet see the light? 
After his luckless collaborative excursion into the 
fields of detective mystery and treasure-seeking, 
Mr. Phillpotts has found his way back to his native 
heath — or rather moor — and once more gives us 
a tale of the rustics whom he knows so well. " The 
Whirlwind " is a tragedy of elemental passion, 
worked out in the lives of a man and a woman of 
primitive instincts. Both are of lowly birth and 
without education ; the man is in addition a sort of 
religious fanatic. The tragedy is of the David and 
Uriah type, the part of David being taken by the 
farmer who employs Daniel Brendon and his wife. 
His sin is Boon followed by repentance, and even 
by religious conversion, but knowledge of the 
woman's lapse from virtue has accidentally come 
into the possession of a former suitor for her hand, 
who bides his time, and plans a dramatic revenge. 
When Daniel's eyes are opened at last, he "sees 
red," and starts on the warpath. His vengeance is 
balked by the natural death of t^he betrayer and the 
suicide of the faithless wife. He then joins the 
Salvation Army, and the story ends. It is a story 
told with all the sombre power which we are wont 
to expect of its author, and the severity of its 
tragic outline is somewhat softened by the scenes 
which portray the homely psychology and the rustic 



wit of the Dartmoor peasantry. It is a story that 
more than ever makes us feel that Mr. Hardy has 
found a worthy successor, 

Sylvia Thesiger was born in an English country 
town, and the liquid music of the neighboring mill 
stream was so wrought into the consciousness of 
her childhood that she ever afterwards dreamed of 
running water. This pretty fancy suggested to Mr. 
A. E. W. Mason a title for his story of Sylvia's life, 
and so he named the book " Running Water." Her 
father had been a famous Alpinist in his younger 
days, but certain unfortunate happenings had forced 
him, long before the story opens, to abandon his 
favorite pastime, and even to change his name. 
He had, in short, been convicted of crime, and was 
doomed to a term of imprisonment. Thereupon his 
wife, a selfish and frivolous person, had left him, 
taking with her the child Sylvia, who has grown up 
with no knowledge of her father beyond a shadowy 
notion that he is living somewhere in London. The 
passion for the mountains is in her blood, and we 
make her acquaintance at Chamounix, where her 
mother's nomadic life has brought her, and where 
she is about to make her first ascent. This expedi- 
tion brings her into contact with a young English- 
man, also a lover of the Alps, and a seasoned 
climber. The combined influences of the man and 
the mountain bring upon her an emotional crisis, 
and she forms a great resolution. A continuance of 
the life she has been leading becomes intolerable, 
and she determines to leave her mother, and seek a 
home with her unknown father. After joining him 
in his London house, and incidentally taking him 
greatly by surprise, she discovers him to be a very 
shady character, who makes a precarious living by 
his wits at the expense of whatever gullible victims 
come within his reach. The developments of the 
narrative from this point are very ingenious and 
interesting. She finds herself at times in positions 
both questionable and dangerous, but v^ith the aid 
of the Englishman who has befriended her in the 
opening chapters, and who becomes her declared 
lover, she averts the perils that threaten her, and 
even exerts a softening influence upon her father's 
criminal character. The story ends, as it began, 
in the Alps, with an exciting expedition over a dan- 
gerous pass, and a semi-tragic situation that keeps 
us in breathless suspense for a time. These ele- 
ments of human and natural interest combine to 
make a tale of singular fascination, over which the 
mountain glamour is cast with such compelling 
effect that it acts as a shaping influence upon the 
lives of all the persons chiefly concerned. 

A sad and simple story of bleak Siberia, almost 
unbearable in the intensity of its tragic pathos, is 
called " The Long Road," and is the work of Mr. 
John Oxenham. It opens with the long march of a 
band of exiles, and deals with the fortunes of Stepan 
Iline — a child when the tale begins, but soon there- 
after a man, sober and thrifty of life, happily mar- 
ried, and blessed with children. In an evil hour, 
Stepan incurs the enmity of the brutal governor of

the province, who devises for him a punishment 
of ingenious cruelty. Expelled from the province 
of Irkutsk, this victim of tyranny is permitted to 
travel elsewhere in Siberia at his will, but is for- 
bidden to remain longer than ten days in any one 
place. Thus driven from his home, Stepan constructs 
a sort of house-wagon, and, taking with him wife and 
children, becomes an itinerant peddler. To the hard- 
ships of this existence are sacrificed one by one his 
wife and his two children, leaving him with nothing 
to live for but the burning hope of revenge upon the 
wanton author of his miseries. For years he seeks 
the opportunity to strike, and at last his enemy lies 
within his power. But the sight of his enemy's 
child, a little girl strangely like the one he himself 
mourns, softens his heart, and by an almost super- 
human effort he foregoes his cherished revenge. 
The rest of the book recounts endless wanderings, 
and the gradual thawing in his breast of feelings 
long congealed ; he finds in service to his fellows a 
kind of solace for the grief that ever grows older, 
and dies beloved by the simple folk whom he has 
helped during the closing years of his pilgrimage. 
The story is deeply moving, and is related with 
knowledge of the life depicted and a rare degree of 
artistic restraint. 

" Poison Island " is a romance compounded of 
familiar ingredients. In a general way, it strongly 
suggests "Treasure Island," while, to be more 
specific, Mr. Quiller-Couch has permitted himself 
the employment of certain devices that he has used 
before to humorous effect — the elderly dame who 
writes atrocious verses, and the strangely assorted 
company who set out upon the expedition which is 
the raison d'etre of the story. The scene is Fal- 
mouth and its neighborhood, and the time that of 
the closing period of the Napoleonic wars. There 
is, of course, an ancient mariner with a mysterious 
past, and equally of course, a chart to indicate the 
location of the treasure. The actual expedition in 
search thereof occupies only about a third of the 
narrative, being preceded by an account of the 
youthful hero's schooldays, and by various fantastic 
happenings. The author's happy faculty for sketch- 
ing eccentric types of character is exhibited at his 
best, and we thoroughly enjoy the quaint company 
that he provides for us. When the island is reached 
(in the Bay of Honduras), it is found to be inhab- 
ited by a singular old gentleman whose chief delight 
is in the reception of treasure-seekers. He has the 
amiable habit of luring them on by smooth words, 
and of poisoning them just as their quest is about 
to be crowned with success. In the present case, 
however, he relents, and concludes to poison himself 
instead, leaving the treasure-seekers in possession. 

" The Diamond Ship " is just the sort of story 
we expect from Mr. Max Pemberton, but is rather 
above the average of his later work. It escapes his 
besetting tendency to be over-fantastic, and tells a 
reasonably straightforward tale of villainy unearthed 
and virtue rewarded. It is, of course, cheaply melo- 
dramatic throughout, but the excitement is well- 



contrived. It is about a gang of international 
thieves, who make jewels their specialty, and who 
have for their rendezvous a pirate ship drifting idly 
about the South Atlantic, far from the track of travel. 
A determined Englishman, with the aid of an agree- 
ably exaggerated Irishman, conceives it to be his 
special mission to destroy this band of outlaws, and 
put the " diamond ship " out of commission. He 
is spurred to his best efforts by the fact that they 
have a young woman, with whom he has fallen in 
love, in their clutches. Before the denouement is 
reached, there is abundant action, on sea and shore, 
and exciting adventures follow one another fast 
enough to keep the most practised reader breathless 
in his endeavor to keep up with them. 

Roger Blois is a young Australian of wealth and 
cultivation, who comes to England to make the 
acquaintance of his kinsfolk. He is the prospective 
heir of Colonel Blois, an English country gentleman, 
whose daughter he is destined to marry. Soon after 
his arrival, and before he has introduced himself to 
his relatives, he is brought accidentally into con- 
tact with one Herbert Gammage (also a relative, 
although a distant one), whose exact counterpart 
he is in form and feature. The resemblance is 
only superficial, for Gammage is a flabby and vulgar 
creature, just then very much down on his luck. 
This acquaintance is formed at a sea-coast village, 
and Roger goes out for a swim. An hour or two 
later, Gammage discovers his clothes, hastily infers 
that he is drowned, and has the brilliant inspiration* 
to don the garments, leaving his own in exchange. 
The next step is to take possession of Roger's belong- 
ings at the hotel, examine his papers, and fit himself 
for his new part. Learning from a letter of invita- 
tion that Colonel Blois expects his Australian kins- 
man in a few days, the imposter presents himself 
at the appointed time, and his manners, which are 
very surprising indeed, are charitably accounted for 
by his Australian upbringing. In the meantime, 
Roger, who has been rescued in a somewhat bat- 
tered condition, is taken to the neighboring farm- 
house which Gammage has been visiting, and there, 
despite his protestations, he is held to be Gammage 
in fact, and his notion that he is someone else is 
treated as a phenomenon of the mental derangement 
from which he is supposed to be suffering. This 
complication ties him up for some time, which 
gives the imposter so much leeway. In the end, 
of course, Roger escapes, establishes his identity, 
startles Gammage by his reappearance, and marries 
the young woman. All of which makes Mrs. Alfred 
Sidgwick's story of " The Kinsman " an excep- 
tionally bright and entertaining work of fiction. 

Sir Elyot Ingall, upon his father's death, finds 
himself the heir to a distinguished name, a large 
county estate, and a burden of debt so heavy that 
title and manor seem little more than a mockery. 
But the young man has stuff in him, and at once 
plans for himself a life of industry and economy 
that, he has reason to hope, will clear the estate in 
the course of a score of years. He might relieve

his necessities by selling his timber, but he has a 
passionate love for the ancient woods that have 
become his property, and a deep conviction that a 
possession of this sort is a sacred trust rather than 
a merely personal appanage. Even more than his 
own trees, he loves the Dower Woods, a neighboring 
forest (once a part of the ancestral estate), now in 
the ownership of a neighbor who shares to the full 
his feeling concerning such possessions. At this 
point of our outline, the heroine must be introduced. 
She is the oldest of seven children, whose parents 
have some pretensions to gentility, but who lead a 
poverty-stricken existence in a cheap house on the 
fringe of the metropolis. Her beauty is of the 
appealing sort, even to the cold-blooded reader ; in 
Sir Elyot, when chance (aided by design) brings 
them together, she awakens the deepest of romantic 
passions. Their engagement follows, although there 
is no prospect of anything more than an engage- 
ment for many years. Meanwhile the owner of the 
Dower Woods determines to leave it to his young 
friend, in whose hands he knows it will be safe from 
the axe. But he has been so charmed by the heroine 
that he is half inclined to leave it to her instead of 
to her prospective husband. In his indecision, he 
prepares two wills, but, being persuaded by his 
lawyer that it would be unwise to make the bequest 
in that indirect fashion, is about to destroy the will 
drawn in favor of the heroine, when he dies unex- 
pectedly. After his death, this will alone is found, 
and of the other no trace can be discovered. Then 
Sir Elyot, knowing nothing of either will, goes to 
America to remain two or three years. During his 
absence, his betrothed is informed of her ownership 
of the Dower Woods, and her essentially shallow 
and pleasure-loving natm-e can see in this accession 
of fortune nothing more than the opportunity of 
gratifying her longings for luxury. She secretly 
arranges to have the timber cut, and with the pro- 
ceeds enters upon the career of a woman of fashion. 
When Elyot returns, he discovers with horror the 
devastation, and later, with far gi-eater horror, that 
the woman he has loved is the one who has dealt 
him this blow. The shock of the discovery kills his 
love for her, and almost kiUs him in the literal 
sense. The other will turns up after a whUe, and 
the hideous work of the axeman is stopped, but only 
after irreparable injury has been done to one of the 
most beautiful bits of woodland natm'e in England. 
The story closes with the heroine's marriage to a 
" bounder " who has pursued her for years, with 
the rehabilitation of Elyot's fortunes and his union 
with the vicar's daughter (whom we have known 
all the time to be the right woman), and with their 
joint resolution to devote the rest of their lives to 
restoring, as far as may be possible, the ravaged 
forest. On its merely human side, this is a singu- 
larly impressive and well-managed story ; to the 
lovers of trees, who can share in Elyot's passion, it 
is an inexpressibly poignant tragedy. It is entitled 
"Sir Elyot of the Woods." The author. Miss 
Emma Frances Brooke, is a Newnham College 



woman and a Fabian socialist, who has been writing 
novels for a dozen years or more, but is compara- 
tively unknown to American readers. 

Mr. Robert Morss Lovett's second novel, "A 
Wingfed Victory," is the story of a self-sacrificing 
girl, in whom the desire to be serviceable is instinc- 
tive, and who, under conditions that would have been 
discouraging to anyone less stout of heart and cheer- 
ful of soul, shapes for herself a successful career of 
usefulness. Her devotion is lavished successively 
upon a baby brother, who dies at an early age, a sel- 
fish and worldly sister, who is adopted by a wealthy 
relative, and upon a somewhat disreputable father, 
who is distinguished by a bent for philosophical con- 
versation and a disinclination to work for an honest 
living. When the heroine goes to college, which a 
lucky windfall enables her to do, she finds a new 
object of devotion in a feUow-student who poses as 
an unrecognized genius, and who is in reality a cub, 
weak, selfish, and conceited. The two are thrown 
together both in school and in settlement work, and 
the girl finally marries him, mistaking for love her 
pity for his weakness. This leads to much wretch- 
edness, but he has the grace to end his existence 
after a while, leaving his widow free to marry the 
man who was obviously destined for her. The story 
is, for the most part, one of college life, the college 
in question being a sort of composite of the three 
situated in and near Chicago. The story is inter- 
esting and cleverly wrought, but is marred by a vein 
of the sort of sentimentalism that affects the modern 
amateur sociologist, and by a false sense of values 
in the social life of the college community. The 
author seems also to be deficient in the power of 
consistent characterization, and leaves us consider- 
ably in doubt as to what he would have us think of 
most of the persons who figure in his novel. 

A good old-fashioned story of Massachusetts Bay 
in the days of Cotton Mather, a story told with the 
affected garrulity of reminiscent old age, may be 
found in Mr. Ruel Perley Smith's " Prisoners of 
Fortune." It is mainly a story about pirates and 
hidden treasure, for pirates were very real in those 
days, and they undoubtedly hid a good deal of 
treasure, although for the most part so effectively 
that no one has been able to find it since. But the 
Boston lad who is the hero of this romance finds 
the private hoard as a matter of course, and rescues 
the distressed heroine — who is a sort of New 
England Lorna Doone — from the villainous gang 
who have held her in dm-ance. 

Virginia Central is the subject of focal interest 
in Mr. Lef fevre's " Sampson Rock of Wall Street." 
The name, as may be surmised, is that of a railway 
and not of a young woman. There is a young 
woman concealed somewhere within the intricate 
•mesh of the narrative, but she is not a real person, 
and hence does n't count. Sampson Rock is a mag- 
nate who has acquired millions by manipulation of 
the stock market. He plans to acquire further 
millions by depressing V. C stock, buying control 
at bargain prices, and then selling the road to 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

another which he ah-eady controls. The ingenious 
and subtle procedure whereby he expects to accom- 
plish his purpose is explained with much particu- 
larity, and the reader is never taken for very long 
or very far from the sound of the ticker. Now 
Sampson Rock has a son, his namesake, familiarly 
known as Sammy, and this hopeful youth, having 
made the grand tour, returns to New York and 
enters his father's office. When he learns of the 
buccaneering enterprise directed against Virginia 
Central, he evolves an ingenious little scheme of 
his own, which is no other than that of acquiring 
the control for himself. Presently, the old man 
discovers that some unknown operator is putting a 
spoke in his wheel, and in consequence thereof the 
stock rises at the wrong time. This very nearly 
brings Sampson face to face with ruin, when Sammy 
shows his hand, and the father's feelings are divided 
between chagrin at his own discomforture and admir- 
ation of the unsuspected " business " capacities of 
the son. It makes a fairly interesting story upon 
a subject that is essentially devoid of any vital 
human interest. No question of morality ever seems 
to enter the head of any of the persons concerned. 

No review of a season's fiction would be complete 
without mention of at least one romance of the 
" Zenda " sort. Our present instance is " The King- 
makers," by Mr. Armiger Barclay. The Kingdom 
of Sergia is, like all the others, torn by dynastic 
intrigue, and in danger of falling prey to the 
Russian bear. When the rightful sovereign has 
won his kingdom, he should by rights have been 
wedded to his royal cousin, but has already pledged 
himself to an English girl, while the cousin has given 
her heart to an Irish suitor. At this juncture, a 
bit of folk-lore is very neatly worked in, and the 
Sergians are reconciled to the acceptance of a foreign 
queen because she seems to realize the fulfillment of 
an omen which means much to their superstitious 
natures. This smoothes away the difficulties that 
beset the other pair of perplexed lovers, and senti- 
ment receives the full measure of its dues. This 
romance is diflPerentiated from others of its class by 
the fact that the action, untU very near the end, 
takes place in England, where the whole plot is 
hatched, and the sinews of war are provided. As 
long as invention can produce stories as good as this, 
we shall not greatly object to them on the score of 
being mere variants upon a well-worn theme. 

A dashing story of adventure in the Empire of 
the Tsar is given us by Mr. Arthur W. Marchmont, 
with " In the Cause of Freedom " for a title. A 
travelling Englishman comes upon a Polish maiden, 
in the company of a notorious conspirator, both pur- 
sued by the police, in a village of Russian Poland. 
The conspirator is dispatched early in the game, 
and the maiden is left on the Englishman's hands. 
Being high-spirited and impressionable, the English- 
man is nothing loth to accept the charge, and the 
pair lead the police a merry chase all the way to 
Warsaw, where the action culminates in street riots 
and other forms of excitement- 



Louis Armitage, an instructor in a Philadelphia 
school, is in New York for a vacation, and is taking 
the air in Central Park. He is suddenly hailed by 
a young woman in a passing carriage, who calls him 
Julian, and insists upon his coming home with her. 
During the drive, he is informed that he is her long- 
lost husband, supposed to be dead. Denial proves 
useless, and the situation proves so pleasant to the 
man, especially when he discovers the luxurious 
nature of his new existence, that after some feeble 
searchings of conscience, he falls into the part that 
a bizarre fate seems to have assigned him, and 
plays it for all it is worth. He is especially inspired 
to persist when he discovers that the woman who" 
claims him (and with whom by this time he is wildly 
in love) has fallen into the clutches of an unscrupu- 
lous lawyer, who is enriching himself at her expense. 
At least, he will countenance the deception until he 
has unmasked the villain. But the villain has a 
little unmasking game of his own, for he soon sus- 
pects Louis to be an impostor, and takes measures 
for his arrest. Then follows a hasty flight from New 
York, in company with his recently acquired wife, 
on their private yacht. Detectives pursue them, 
and finally the wife seems to be convinced that the 
man is not Julian after all, whereupon she leaves 
him stranded. This is a great shock to him, so great, 
indeed, that it suddenly awakens dormant memories, 
and he realizes that he is Julian in fact, and that 
as Louis he has simply been a sufferer from dual 
personality. Moreover, his wife (who is really his 
wife) had been sure of it aU the time, and had 
planned the shock (under the advice of an alienist) 
for the express purpose of reviving his lapsed 
memory. It is not often that a novel has as unex- 
pected a denouement as this, and the writer has 
displayed no little ingenuity in sustaining the mys- 
tification until he is ready to clear it away. " The 
Castle of Doubt " is the name of this entertaining fab- 
rication, which is the work of Mr. John H. Whitson. 

Miss Stanley's " A Modern Madonna " is, in its 
outline, the familiar story of the woman who marries 
a man for his showy qualities and social position, 
without any serious effort to sound his character, 
and who soon thereafter learns that his love is a 
superficial and evanescent affair. When she dis- 
covers, early in the narrative, that he is no more 
than a shallow and impulsive creature, and faithless 
into the bargain, she separates herself from him. 
The scene of the novel is Washington, and the 
rejected husband, taking advantage of a law that 
formerly disgraced the statute-book of the District, 
makes a wiU removing their child from the custody 
of the mother, and placing it in the hands of his 
elder brother, a soured person who disapproved of 
the marriage, and who regards all women with sus- 
picion. Presently the husband is murdered by a 
woman whom he has betrayed, and the circum- 
stances of the crime are such as to make the brother 
believe that the wife is the guilty person. Acting 
upon this conviction, he insists upon taking posses- 
sion of the child, and, the law having ruled in his

favor, the mother is forced to take flight with her 
offspring. For several years she eludes pursuit, but 
finally the detectives discover her hiding-place, seize 
the child, and put it in the hands of its lawful 
guardian. In the end, the truth of the murder comes 
out, the fact of the mother's innocence is established 
in the mind of the only man who has ever doubted 
it, and the outcome of the whole complication is that 
the mother marries the man whom she has hitherto 
most hated, while he, filled with remorse for the 
consequences of his error, seeks, by the depth of 
his newly-awakened love, to atone for the wrong he 
has done the suffering woman. A large section of 
the story is devoted to an account of a political 
agitation for the repeal of the statute which has in 
this instance abetted so wicked a wrong. In this 
aspect, the book degenerates into a piece of pam- 
phleteering, and suffers correspondingly as a work 
of art. But it is, on the whole, a strong novel, 
exhibiting variety of incident, depth of feeling, 
and a genuine gift of characterization. 

A delightful story of the South, a story of com- 
paratively recent years, although rooted in an 
episode of the Federal occupation of New Orleans 
during the Civil War, is told in "The Price of 
Silence," from the accomplished pen of Mrs. M. E. 
M. Davis. The heroine belongs to an exclusive old 
famUy of the French Quarter, but there is a sup- 
posed blot upon her birth. A document is in exist- 
ence which seems to indicate that the most terrible 
of all disgraces (from the distorted Southern point 
of view) is hers; in other words, that there is a 
slight infusion of negro blood in her veins. This 
document is stolen by Butler's provost officer in the 
sixties, and in the eighties, when the story proper 
begins, is in the possession of a son of that officer, 
an unscrupulous scoundrel who has somehow secured 
an entrance into New Orleans society, and who uses 
his knowledge to blackmail the girl's famUy, and 
to force the girl herself into marriage with him. 
Meanwhile, the right sort of hero makes his appear- 
ance, foils the villain, disproves the dark imputation 
upon the girl's lineage, does pretty nearly every- 
thing else that a truly devoted hero ought to do, 
and at last wins the heroine. The stoiy is told 
with unfailing animation, and pictures with great 
fidelity the traits of the old French society now 
rapidly passing from view as a distinctive element 
in the life of the ancient city of Bienville.

The " Pocket Book of Poems and Songs for the Open 
Air" (Button), compiled by Mr. Edward Thomas, is 
one of those anthologies, so numerous of late, which 
find their pattern in Mr. Lucas's " The Open Road." 
The inclusion of some sixty old English songs and bal- 
lads, with the original musical scores, is a unique feature 
of considerable interest. Colored end-papers, showing 
inside and outside views of the " Red Lion " inn, are 
supplied by Mr. William Hyde. The wayfarer in whose 
wallet this pretty volume finds place will not lack for 
entertainment along the road.

ography of Ralph Waldo Emerson has been received 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and will be issued 
by them in the fall as one of their series of bibUographies 
of American authors. 

Two more volumes of the « Men of the Kingdom "

Graham. Mr. George S. Innis writes of "WyclLffe: 
The Morning Star," and Mr. WiUiam H. Crawford of 
" Savonarola: The Prophet." 

Mr. Frank Mathew's volume on Ireland, published 
two years ago in Macmillan's " color book " series, is 
now reissued in cheaper form, with thirty-two of Mr. 
Francis S. Walker's beautifid illustrations in color re- 
tained out of seventy-nine in the original edition. 

« A Book of the Pyrenees," by Mr. S. Baring-Gould, 
is essentially a guide-book, but one that is readable as 
well as practically helpful. It combines much history 
and geography with its detailed information for tourist 
use, and has twenty-five photographic views by way of 
illustration. 

The WiUiam R. Jenkins Co. have been of late years 
the publishers of " The Complete Pocket-Guide to 
Europe," a small manual originally planned by Messrs. 
E. C. and T. L. Stedman, and long favorably known to 
tourists. It now comes to us in its new annual edition, 
carefully revised to date. 

A timely and attractive publication of Mr. Robert 
Grier Cooke is the quarto volume containing reproduc- 
tions of twenty-four drawuigs in color by Miss Rosina 
C. Boardman depicting some interesting members of the 
lily and orchid families. Brief descriptions, untechnical 
in form, of the species shown in the plates and a num- 
ber of others are included by way of text. 

" A Source Book of Greek History," by Dr. Fred 
Morrow Fling, is published by Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co. It covers the period from the Homeric age to 
the Achaean League, and is provided with many illus- 
trations. Each chapter has a useful set of suggestive 
questions and exercises. Altogether, it is a work of a 
helpful and needed sort, particularly well edited. 

The latest series of standard works in convenient 
form is the " Pocket Library " of Messrs. Longmans, 
Green & Co. Four volumes have so far reached us, 
comprising Cardinal Newman's " Apologia pro Vita 
Sua," Jefferies' « Story of My Heart," Mr. J. W. Mac- 
kail's " Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology," 
and the first series of F. Anstey's inimitable " Voces 
Populi." The form of the volumes is both pretty and 
serviceable. 

A group of related essays from the pen of Miss 
Margaret W. Morley on the natural history of grass- 
hoppers, locusts, crickets, katydids, walking-sticks, and 
other common insects is published under the title 
" Grasshopper Land " (McClurg). The book is a well- 
executed piece of sugar-coated science, intended for 
children or amateur naturalists, and is couched in lit- 
erary rather than scientific form. It abounds in classical 
and historical references, and its anatomical and ento- 
mological data are trustworthy. The author's style is 
pleasing, and the illustrations are exceptionaUy spirited.

Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. publish a " Prac- 
tical European Guide," by Mr. M. D. Frazar, who has 
been engaged in the " tourist business " for many years. 
It is a small book, but it contains a great deal of infor- 
mation about hotels, routes, fares, and noteworthy 
sights. A book of more limited scope, and consequently 
greater particularity, is Miss Elizabeth Otis Williams's 
" Sojourning, Shopping, and Studying in Paris," pre- 
pared for the uses of womankind, and published by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. The book has a good 
map. 

An excellent guide to the common wild flowers, for 
the use of young nature-lovers, is provided by Miss 
Edith Dunham in the volume entitled " Fifty Flower 
Friends with Familiar Faces" (Lothrop). A brief per- 
sonal sketch of each flower is given, with illustration 
and exact description, and twelve species are depicted 
in colored plates by Mr. W. I. Beecroft. A number of 
appropriate flower poems, by various writers, are inter- 
spersed throughout the pages. The boy or girl into 
whose hands this book is placed can hardly fail to 
acquire a real and lasting interest in our every-day 
wild flowers. 

A volimae highly useful to students of the histoiy of 
literature, and one which represents a great deal of work 
on the part of the compiler, is " A Summary of the 
Literatures of Modern Europe," by Miss Marian Ed- 
wardes, now published by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. 
The period is from the origins to the close of the four- 
teenth century, and the literatures treated are those of 
England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The 
work is essentially an annotated and classified bibliog- 
raphy, with references to the most authoritative schol- 
arly discussions of the writings included. It presents 
an immense mass of historical and critical information 
in a form that is both compact and convenient for use. 

Forthcoming volumes in the " Belles-Lettres Series," 
published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., will include the 
following: " The Fair Penitent and Jane Shore," edited 
by Professor Sophie Chantal Hart, of Wellesley Col- 
lege ; Chapman's " All Fool's and The Gentleman Usher," 
edited by Professor T. M. Parrott, of Princeton Univer- 
sity; "The Spanish Gypsy and All's Lost by Lust," 
edited by Professor E. P. Morris, of Syracuse Univer- 
sity; " Exodus and Daniel in West Saxon," edited by 
Professor F. A. Blackburn, of the University of Chicago; 
" The Owl and the Nightingale," edited by Professor 
John E. Wells, of Hiram College; "Select Poems 
of Alfred Tennyson," edited by Professor Archibald 
MacMachan, of Dalhousie College. 

Dr. Paul Cams has given much attention of recent 
years to the study of the Chinese character as expressed 
in language, literature, and philosophy. Two of his 
books, just issued by the Open Court Publishing Co., 
deal respectively with " Chinese Thought " and " Chinese 
Life and Customs." The former is a continuation of 
his earlier essay on " Chinese Philosophy." Both books 
have many illustrations. Abundantly illustrated also 
are two other books by Dr. Cams, which still further 
attest his scholarly industry. " The Rise of Man " is 
a series of chapters upon the evolution of the human 
species, written in untechnical language, and embodying 
the most modern ideas of the anthropologists. " The 
Story of Samson " is an extremely interesting popular 
study in comparative mythology, with a tendency to 
treat the story as a solar legend, although not denying 
the possibility of some historical basis.

A Novel by the Author of "JOSEPH VANCE" 
Waiiam De Morgan's ALICE-FOR-SHORT 

i2mo, 563 pp. 2nd large printing. $1.75. 
The Nation says of " Alice-f or-short " : 

" 'Joseph Vance,' with its full-blooded people, its unabashed sentiment, its life-like inconsecutiveness, its endless 
delightful talky-talky, won back for us fathers and grandfathers of today the dear atmosphere of that world of 
fiction in which we were reared. . . . This is Dickens, that is Thackeray, yonder is a hint of the Du Maurier 
stepping-stone . . . there is no manner of doubt as to the school to which this new-old craftsman belongs ; the 
important fact is that he belongs to it, and does not merely hang upon its heels. ' Alice-f or-short ' is sure to 
retain for its author the friends which ' Joseph Vance ' made for him. . . . The plot of this second novel is 
much more elaborate than that of the first."

" One does not grow tired of its excellence. ' Skipper,' the main figure, is an ancient caddie on the St. Andrews 
links. . . . The story, too, is good. One does not need to be a golf enthusiast to appreciate it. But one who 
is a golf enthusiast cannot afford to miss it." — Cleveland Plain T)ealer.
