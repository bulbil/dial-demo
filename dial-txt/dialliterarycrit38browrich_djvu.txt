NEW BOOKS AND NEW EDITIONS 



EMERSON 



The Cextexaky Edition of the Complete Writings of RALPH WALDO EMERSON, just 
published, consists of twelve attractive volumes, and is perfect in every detail of hookinaking. 



THE INTRODUCTION has been 
written by the editor, Edward 
Waldo Emzrsox. who has given in 
brief compass a fresh and aathorita- 
tive account of his father's life and 
work. 

THE TEXT is that of the River- 
side Edition, presenting, in the earlier 
volumes, the readings finally decided 
upon by Mr. Emerson himself, while 
the later volumes were collected and 
revised by his friend and biographer, 
Mr. J. Elliot Cabot. 

THE PORTRAITS. Five pho- 
togravures reproduced from the best 
original portraits. 



The Volumes comprise: 

1. Natcbe, Addresses, aud 

Lkctures. With Portrait. 

2. Ess.ws. First Series. 

3. Ess.ws. Second Series. 

4. Repbesextattve Men. 

.5, Engush Tkaits. Portrait. 

6. CoifDucT OK Life. Portr^t. 

7. Society and Solitcdb. 

5. Lettebs AND Social Aims. 
9. Poems. With Portrait. 

10. LECTtTRES AND BIOGRAPH- 

ICAL Sketches. Portrait. 

11. Miscellanies. 

12. Natctral History of In- 

tellect and other papers. 



THE NOTES, by Edward Waldo 
Emerson, are printed at the end of 
each volume. They explain the cir- 
cumstances attending the delivery of 
the more famous discourses, indicate 
the impression made by the essays at 
their first publication, comment upon 
persons and events mentioned in the 
text, and often trace in Emerson's 
poetry the thought or the phrase which 
appears also in his prose. As no anno- 
tated edition of Emerson's writings 
has hitherto been issued, this feature 
of the Centenary Edition gives it 
pecoliar importance. 

AN INDEX, very complete, has 
been prepared for the entire Works.

BLOUNT S opinion: 

'^ Half the men who are earning the big 
money in law here in Chicago donH know 
enough law to try a case properly. . . . 
Who cares for fine professional work if it 
don't bring in the stuff? It's money every 
time ! " 

PEMBERTON'S view: 

^' Men are so made that they want to respect 
something. And in the long run they will 
respect learning, ideas, and devotion to the 
public welfare." 

HARRIS'S answer: 

" What men respect in this town is money 
first, last and all the time. . . . It don't 
make much difference, either, how you get 
your money so far as I can see. Whether 
you do a man in a corner in wheat, or run 
a pool-room. All is if you want to be 
m the game you must have the price of 
admission about you." 

HELEN'S wish: 

"J ivish you were a clerk, a laborer, a 
farmhand, — auything, so that we could 
be honest, and think of something besides 
making money . . . and live like the com- 
mon people from day to day — live for 
your work, for the thing you do." 

THE ARCHITECT'S climax: 

" One by one he recalled the fraudulent 
works in which he had had a part, — 
the school from which he had tried to steal 
some of the money his uncle had denied him, 
and finally this hotel which had crumpled 
at the touch of fire. That spirit of greed 
had eaten him through and through."

AX APOLOG IE FO R PIRACIE. 

After experiencing the benefits of interna- 
tional copyright for thirteen years — alsit omen 
— the act whereby those benefits were secured 
to American and English authors alike is now 
brought up for renewed discussion by no less a 
IDcrson than Mr. Howells, who, in his ' Editor s 
Easy Chair' for December, registers a half- 
querulous complaint, and suggests, at least, that 
our reading public has been in some ways a 
sufferer through the operation of the act in 



.v..-rV;; 

quesiibn. The responsibility for the complaint 
is thrown, in part, upon the shoulders of an 
anonymous 'friend,' who is quoted as opining 
* that the Devil has got hold of the job. and 
turned it to his own ends,' that ' no solid Eng- 
lish book is reprinted here,' that our ' publishers 
don't look at a serious b<x)k,' and that * no one 
now reads anything but trash,' and who closes 
his screed with the prediction that *we shall 
relapse into barbarism, and then resort to piracy, 
which will so improve our minds that we shall 
again seek a lawful alliance, then degenerate 
again, and so on and so on.' 

This whimsical plaint evidently appeals to 
Mr. Howells, for he proceeds on his own account, 
and in somewhat similar vein, to comment upon 
the consequences of our ' wanton benevolence ' 
as expressed in the law of 1891. Although he 
does not write in the fashion of one who 
expects to be taken altogether seriously, he 
makes some rather positive assertions that chal- 
lenge inquiry. He says, for example, that ' the 
law has strangely and curiously resulted in 
alienating the international public which the 
authors of the two countries chiefly concerned 
used to enjoy, or rather which used to enjoy 
them. English authors have now less currency 
in America than they had before the passage 
of the act, and American authors have less cur- 
rency in England, although in the social, politi- 
cal, and commercial interests there has been so 
great an affinition of their respective nations.' 
?fow assertions like these may without much 
diflBculty be brought to the test of fact, and 
that test seems to us to refute the verj- bases of 
the argument so genially developed by Mr. 
Howelk. 

Discussing these strange propositions, 'The 
Publisher's Weekly' says flatly of their pro- 
pounder that ' his conclusions are as wrong as 
his premises, and his premises as wrong as his 
facts.' Mr. George Haven Putnam, who, assur- 
edly, does know the facts, likens the essayist's 
reasoning to that which is reputed, according to 
the old rhyme, to have made a heretic of Bishop 
Colenso. 

' A bishop there was of Natal, 
Who a Zulu did take for a pal ; 
Said the Zulu : " Look here. 
Ain't the Pentateuch queer?" 
Which converted my Lord of Natal. ' 

And Mr. George Piatt Brett, who likewise knows 
tlie facts, declares that ^Ir. Howells's article 
' fairly bristles with unfounded charges as to the 
evil effect^ of international copyright.' 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



Have American authors less currency in Eng- 
land than they had before the Copyright Act 
of 1891 ? The correspondent whom Mr. 
Howells quotes says that 'not even our worst- 
authors are now popular in England, let alone 
our best ones. . . . The younger English 
readers do not know our good authors ; and there 
is unhappily growing up in the racially and 
lingually related countries a generation re- 
ciprocally ignorant of their respective litera- 
tures.' ISTow if this be the case with our 
authors in the mother-country, it can hardly 
be a consequence of the act in question, for 
the simple reason that under that act our 
authors have practically the same standing that 
they had before. Before its adoption, they 
might, if they so desired, secure English copy- 
right under substantially the same conditions 
at present. If more of them noAv do so than 
formerly, it is because they have become more 
enterprising in protecting their books from 
piracy. The proverbial stubbornness of facts 
when confronted with imaginary suppositions 
is illustrated by Mr. Brett's reference to the 
official statistics of our Government, ''which 
prove that, not only has the business of 
exporting books nearly doubled in tlie last five 
years, but that the value of books exported from 
this country is very much greater than the value 
of books imported into it,' Mr. Brett further 
avers that ' few American books of wide popu- 
larity fail to appear in special English editions 
printed abroad Avhich find a public there cer- 
tainly not smaller than that enjoyed by writers 
of native origin.' And he clinches his case by 
quoting a fellow-puiblisher to the following 
effect: 'The records of our sales show that 
instead of a decrease in the sale of American 
books in England there has been a greater sale 
of works by Ilnited States authore in that coun- 
try during the last three years than ever before.' 

So much having been said for one aspect of 
the question, let us now turn to the other. Here. 
of course, the case is somewhat different, for 
if an English author wishes to obtain copy- 
right in this country upon our hard conditions, 
he may do so, whereas previous to 1891 he had 
no possible protection from our laws. Doubt- 
less, under the act of 1891, we have diminished 
our reading of English literarj^ rubbish, and 
substituted therefor the reading of the similar 
home product. But good English books are 
certainly obtainable in this country at prices 
that compare favorably with those at what the 
best American books are put upon the market. 
More than this it is not reasonable to expect. 
There have been a few instances, no doubt, in 
which important English books have had 
unusually high prices set upon them in both 
markets, a proceeding which we may consider 
unwise, but concerning which we have not the 



shadow of a right to be dictatorial. A com- 
plaint upon this score is hardly more than a 
veiled apology for the piratical practices which 
so shamed us before the law ended them in 
1891, and which flouted in the most brazen 
manner the rights of literary property. Mr. 
Putnam declares it to be ' undoubtedly the 
case that there has been with copyrighted 
foreign books a steady tendency to lower prices,' 
and in support of this proposition quotes Mr. 
Spofford's statement that 'the great benefit of 
international copyright has been the gradujil 
decline in the price of standard foreign works.' 

Thus the contention of Mr. Howells and his 
correspondent is shown to have not a leg uiwn 
which to stand ; one of the two being completely 
amputated by the official facts, while the other, 
if still preserving a semblance of functional 
activity, is seen to be too crippled for any real 
usefulness. There is absolutely nothing in the 
considerations adduced which gives cause of 
legitimate complaint against our national pro- 
tection of the rights of English authors. But 
there may be seen at many points, just beneath 
the surface, the crest of the reptile that was 
scotched in 1891 after years of effort. Mr. 
Howells should not speak of 'the ruthless but 
kindly rule of the pirate,' nor should he give 
voice to any plea based upon the grievance of 
our being no longer able to get English books 
by plunder. Of course he does not really 
mean that we ought to withdraw the protec- 
tion of our law from English writers ; and, des- 
pite what goes before, Ave have no doubt that 
his closing sentence, in which he says that we 
had better keep ' our historical novels and a 
good conscience' than get 'the best English 
fiction and the sense of having robbed the 
author,' is the expression of his inmost thought. 
iSTevertheless, we cannot but regard as infelici- 
tous the manner in which he has raised this 
buried subject of discussion. 

As a matter of fact, our law should be 
amended for the further protection of English 
authors, and of the authors of the Continental 
countries. It still affords inadequate protec- 
tion for works that have to be translated from 
foreign tongues, while the provision for double 
typesetting, inserted at the dictation of a self- 
ish class interest, remains as a dark blot upon 
its character. As ' The Nation ' remarked 
many years ago, this provision would be fairly 
matched by a provision that no foreigner land- 
ing in the United States should be entitled to 
the protection of the police and the courts until 
he had purchased, and was actually Avearing, a 
suit of clothes made by an American tailor. 
Such is the reductio ad ahsurdum to which we 
are led by a candid examination of this most 
obnoxious clause in an otherwise commendable 
piece of legislation. 



1905.] 



THE DIAL. 



How our curious unwillingness to adopt a 
policy of thoroughgoing fairness toward foreign 
authors affects us in the eyes of the international 
public is strikingly illustrated by our copyright 
relations with Japan, an illustration which Mr. 
Putnam uses with telling effect. For some 
years we have been trying to secure a copy- 
right treaty with that country, but the reply 
which the statesmen of Japan make to our 
request is, in substance, ' that when our nation 
has accepted the world's standard of action in 
regard to the recognition of literary property, 
and has become a party to the Convention of 
Berne, no separate treaty between the United 
States and Japan will be necessary.' In other 
words, the Asiatic empire accepts the civilized 
provisions of that Convention and the American 
commonwealth rejects them! It should be a 
cause for much searching of hearts, because, 
as Mr. Putnam justly says, this attitude on our 
part puts us outside ' the comity of nations ' 
in the treatment of the rights of authors. 



THE THANKLESS MUSE. 



Again and again the would-be author is 
warned not to adopt literatiire as a vocation, 
but, if he must dabble in letters, to let his writ- 
ing be merel}- an avocation, a side issue, a 
harmless relaxation from the stem business of 
law or medicine or theology or trade. It is time 
a word were uttered on the other side, and a 
plea made for what Milton aUowed himself to 
c-all ' the thankless Muse.' 

At the outset it will of course be understood 
that if one's ambition is to * get on ' in a worldly 
sense, if fame and fortune and a numerous 
j^rogeny are the objects of desire, literature is 
an exceUent calling not to embrace. But pre- 
supposing that one has enough of the ascetic 
and tlie stoic in his composition to enable him 
to eat bread and pulse (if need be) with a glad 
heart, literature will be found to offer not 
merely compensations but real and positive sat- 
isfactions, and that too, most often, in inverse 
ratio to the success, commercially considered, 
that is attained in its pursuit. " Mature is sat- 
isfied with little, and if she be so, even so am 
I.' Thus said Spinoza, the excommunicated 
Jew, who, as tradition has it, was forced by 
IK)verty to abandon his hope of winning the 
gifted Clara Maria van den Ende and soon 
became absorbed in a more ideal love-suit 
— to immortal truth. A more strenuous 
literary life than his it would be hard to 
imagine. Practicing, from choice as well as 
from necessity, a rigid economy in daily 
life, confined somewhat closely to his chamber 
both bv the oxactinix nature of his studies and 



by the state of his health, the life-long object 
of malignant assault and acrimonious abuse 
from the orthodox, alienated even as a youth 
from his family and early f riends;, and in hearty 
intellectual accord with none of his contem- 
poraries, this heroic scholar and writer has yet 
given us his word that his life was a happy one. 
Problems perplexed him until it was easier for 
him to work at their solution than to refrain; 
and in this inward compulsion he found his 
happiness. 

Counsels of perfection are cheap, and it is 
not the present writers purpose to indulge in 
them. But the name of Spinoza, the devoted 
seeker and declarer of truth, calls up that of his 
great English contemporary, who counted it 
gain to lose his eyesight in penning his ' Pro 
Populo Anglicano Defensio.' Warned by his 
ph}-6ician what he must expect, ^I would not 
have listened,' Milton declares, ' to the voic-e of 
iEsculapius himself in preference to the sug- 
gestions of the heavenly monitor within my 
breast : my resolution was unshaken, though, the 
alternative was either the loss of my sight or 
the desertion of my dut}-. . . I resolved, there- 
fore, to make the short interval of sight which 
was left me as beneficial as possible to the com- 
mon weal.' Another devoted follower of litera- 
ture and learning, but one whom we are more 
inclined to think of as a dry-as-dust gerund- 
grinder, an arrogant and irritable pedant, than 
as an acute writer and reasoner of recognized 
authority, is the younger Scaliger. Living in 
the century preceding that of Spinoza and Mil- 
ton, and when literature received even less rec- 
ognition as a reputable calling, Joseph Scaliger 
had the courage to be true to himself. When 
as a young man he was offered an assistant- 
professorship of law at Valence in acknowledg- 
ment of his remarkable attainments in juris- 
prudence, he did not for a moment hesitate in 
liis reply or so much as dream of tu rn ing his 
back on literature, which he rated above law, 
medicine, the diurch, or any other calling. He 
had mastered law merely as an instrument of 
philological inquiry, which was in his eyes not 
an amusement for the ingenious, but the only 
means of interpreting ancient records. 

Those who have read (as all ought to have) 
Herbert Spencer's Autobiography, will remem- 
ber what he says in his closing chapter about 
the consolations of literature 'It has been 
with me,' he writes, ' b. source of continual 
pleasure, distinct from other pleasures, to 
evolve new thoughts, and to be in some sort a 
spectator of the way in which, under pereistent 
contemplation, they gradually imfolded into 
completeness. There is a keen delight in intel- 
lectual conquest — in appropriating a portion 
of the unlmown and bringing it within the 
realm of the known.' But of mere success as 



6 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



an author in the eyes of the world, he main- 
tains that when it is achieved it often brings 
vexations and worries greatly overbalancing the 
pleasures. ' Adverse criticisms of utterly unjust 
kinds frequently pursue the conscientious 
writer, not only during his period of struggle, 
but after he has reached his desired position. 
Careless mis-statements and gross misrepresen- 
tations continually exasperate him; and if he 
measures the pains produced by these against 
the pleasures produced by due appreciation, he 
is likely to find them in excess.' Again he 
declares : 'Of literary distinction, as of so 
many other things which men pursue, it may 
be truly said that the game is not worth the 
candle. . . A transitory emotion of joy may be 
produced by the first marks of success; but 
after a time the continuance of success excites 
no emotion which rises above the ordinary 
level,' In the same vein he writes, ' It is indeed 
astonishing to what an extent men are deluded 
into pursuit of the bubble reputation when they 
have within their reach satisfactions which are 
much greater.' But for him who devotes him- 
self to serious authorship not for the saJce of 
reputation or pecuniairy return, there are ample 
rewards in store, though he must be prepared 
to practise renunciation. Spencer tells us that 
a writer of this class ' must be content to remain 
celibate, unless indeed he obtains a wife having 
adequate means for both, and is content to put 
himself in the implied position. Even then 
family cares and troubles are likely to prove 
fatal to his undertakings. As was said to me 
by a scientific friend, who himself knew by 
experience the effect of domestic worries — 
"Had you married there would have been no 
system of philosophy." ' But, * after all,' Spen- 
cer concludes in his own case, ' my celibate life 
has probably been the best for me as well as the 
liest for some unknown other.' As Gibbon 
solaced himself with a history instead of a wife, 
so Spencer found compensation in his Synthetic 
Philosophy for the renounced conjugal joys; 
and in the ' weeks, months and years of 
wretched nights and vacant days ' that made 
existence for him ' a long-drawn weariness,' the 
one thing that supported him and gave him a 
motive for continuing the struggle was the 
hope, however faint, of finishing his self- 
appointed task. 

Having, then, pondered Spencer's words of 
counsel and warning, and made up our minds 
to attempt something in literature to benefit 
mankind, we are further cautioned by our phil- 
osopher to be ready to bear losses and priva- 
tions, and perhaps ridicule. For '^ adequate 
appreciation of writings not adapted to satisfy 
popular desires is long in coming, if it ever 
comes; and it comes the more slowly to one 
who is either not in literary circles, or, being in 



them, will not descend to literary " log-rolling " 
and other arts by which favourable recognition 
is often gained. Comparative neglect is almost 
certain to follow one who declines to use influ- 
ence with reviewei-s, as I can abundantly tes- 
tify.' 

These quotations may be thought much more 
deterrent than encoiiraging to the literary 
aspirant. Let them rather nerve him to sterner 
and loftier endeavor. What there is of truth 
in them can work him no harm. It is astonish- 
ing how little is required, of material resources, 
to support a life of plain living and high think- 
ing. There is more than a kernel of truth in 
what Thoreau, a writer eminently unsuccessful 
in a business way, says of the poet. ' The poet 
is he that hath fat enough, like bears and mar- 
mots, to suck his claws all winter. He hiber- 
nates in this world and feeds on his own mar- 
row.' 

Perhaps, therefore, the best fortune one can 
wish a young writer is to be ever on the eve of 
a great success, but never quite to attain it ; for 
with complete success, if such there be, must 
come disillusion, weariness, and disgust. It is 
only those who take the static and not the 
dynamic view of life who cherish expectations 
of gaining this perfectly satisfying success, 
which always turns out to be simply another 
name for stagnation and death. What is better 
than to be beckoned forever onward by the ideal 
that alone gives purpose and meaning to one's 
life? ' Every motive of a great artist must, in 
its perfect completion, open the mind, as it 
were, to perceive a still greater work, which 
hovers invisibly above it, and fills us, while we 
laiow not whence it comes, with that ever unsat- 
isfied curiosity which, after fancying it has 
exhausted all, feels, at the very moment we 
turn away, that it has only seen the smallest 
part.' So says Hermann Grimm in his biog- 
raphy of Michael Angelo. It is the dimming 
of this ideal, the blurring and blotting of this 
beatific vision, that is too often wrought by 
that success which is measured in terms of 
popular applause and in dollars and cents. 
From this kind of success we cannot too fer- 
vently pray that our weakness may be delivered. 
The book that wins immediate acclaim with 
the masses, and large pecuniary returns, is the 
book an author should devoutly hope never to 
write. 

The humorous complaint of a popular writer 
that not one of her offered contributions had 
ever been rejected by an editor, because she 
wrote nothing of sufficient depth to be misun- 
derstood, may well have had a note of sincerity 
in it. Immediate favor is often won at the cost 
of subsequent neglect. The purveyor to the 
demands of the hour seldom ministers to the 
needs of the centuries. To be sure, it may be

said that it is very easy to affect a fine scorn 
of an unattainable success; and disparagement 
of even a transitory renown will inevitably 
recall a certain ancient fable. But it has never 
been proved that the grapes were not really 
sour. The chances are very many that, could they 
have been reached, they would have proved 
somewhat disappointing. At the utmost, they 
would have yielded but a momentar}- gratifica- 
tion. This much, finally, is certain, that in 
the success that tempts or forces one to renounce 
a congenial solitude for the whirl of society, 
a lettered seclusion for the glare of pub- 
licity, the silent approval of one's conscience 
for the resounding plaudits of the crowd, 
there lurks a very real danger. Gregari- 
ousness, it has been well said, is not conducive 
to the production of fine literature. The gen- 
erative process will not be exposed to the vidgar 
gaze; conception has its mysterious laws, in 
things of the spirit even more than in those of 
the body ; and to him alone who will ' strictly 
meditate the thankless Muse' shall it be given 
to effect something praiseworthy in literature, 
and to learn that the Muse, thus courted, is not 
so thankless a mistress after all.

JAPANESE IMPERIAL POETRY. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
The poems of the Japanese Emperor always 
possess interest to his people; but his recent 
metrical ventures have a special s'igmifieance in 
the present crisis, as the following clipping from 
the 'Japan Times' will show: 

' The Kokumin, which, in its Imperial Birthday num-

illustrious virtues and sublime wisdom of our most august 
Emperor, the well-spring of Japanese patriotism, Japanese 
loyalty and Japanese valour, knows the right chord where-

does, to the same subject by reproducing some of His 
Majesty's latest poetical compositions (uta), with appro- 
priate remarks. The journal quotes three of these, and 
our literal translation of them, which cannot be expected 
to do justice to the Imperial original, is as follows: 

" The sons, all

Memoirs of ax Irish Poet.* 



Tokyo, Japan, Dec. 1, irW4. 



Ebxest W. Clbment. 



A biography of Aubrey Thomas de Vere 
could hardly fail to be interesting. His mind 
and character were so noble, his personality 
was so attractive, his friendships among great 
contemporaries were so numerous, that an 
account of his life and achievements could 
hardly fail to charm. The present volume, by 
Mr. Wilfrid Ward, is intended to take the place 
of the second volume of recollections which Mr., 
de Vere had planned (the first appearing in- 
1897), but of which he had at death written 
practically nothing. As his literar}- executor^ 
Mr. Ward found many of his letters and many 
passages in his diaries suitable for publication.. 
These he has skilfully woven into a readable 
narrative, in such a way as to let the poet tell 
his own story and reveal his own mind and tem- 
perament, at the same time furnishing ' some 
graphic contemporary descriptions of great 
men.' 

Many will regret that Mr. Ward has not 
given us a fuller biography, based on all of 
de Yere's published recollections and on a full 
collection of his letters. Little is here said, 
for example, of his poetry and of his position 
among the Victorian singers. But we must 
respect Mr. Ward's plea that the limit of time 
prescribed by Mr. de Vere for the publication of 
this work rendered a fuller biography impos- 
sible; and that the materials presented are, 
after all, sufficient to give a true picture of 
the man himself. 

The life of Aubrey de Vere was a long and 
comparatively uneventful one. Born in the 
year before Waterloo, he survived all of his 
famous contemporaries, living through a year 
of the new century. Although he took a keen 
interest in public affairs, — the distresses of 
Ireland, the American Civil War, the ec-clesias- 
tical controversies of the time, — his life was 
mainly spent in solitude, in the study of poetry 
and theology. Destined by his father for the 
Church, he seems from an early age to have 
been fond of theological reading and a close 
student of religious problems. The narrative 
of his gradual change of belief, which led to 
his reception in 1851 into the Chtirch of Rome, 
is well told, of course at considerable length 
and with svmpathetic approval. Mr. Ward 
speaks on these matters with no uncertain 
voice; yet we must commend his thoroughly 
broad and liberal treatment of the whole subject

of the Oxford Movement and ite tendencies, so 
■far as he touches on them here. 

De Vere's theological speculations, however, 
did not remove him entirely from the world 
of action. During the terrible famine of 
1846-7, he devoted himself to energetic work on 
relief committees, and to that close study of the 
Irish situation which bore fruit in 1848 in his 
* English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds,' which 
Lord Manners pronounc-ed ' the most valuabLi 
contribution to our Irish political literature 
since the days of Burke,' and in almost every 
passage of which even Carlyle found ' much to 
agree with.' Throughout his life, his voice and 
pen were active in the effort to ameliorate the 
conditions in Ireland, and to solve such per- 
plexing questions as that of adjusting lana difR- 
culties and of providing for the university edu- 
cation of larger numbers of Catholic Irishmen. 

Yet Avhile Aubrey de Vere won some distinc- 
tion as an able political thinker, he will be 
remembered chiefly as a poet. Poetry was his 
real vocation ; and though he failed to win wide 
recognition,* his devotion to poetry was none 
the less ardent. His failure to win popular 
favor is explainable on more than one ground. 
One reason he himself gives, in a letter to Pro- 
fessor Charles Eliot Norton. 

'Literary labour, with the hope of a result, must 
be a very animating thing! For a great many years 
I have never written anything in prose or verse 
without the knowledge that, on account of jeal- 
ousies and animosities, either political or polemical, 
what I wrote was in fact but a letter to some few 
friends, known and unknown, to be illustrated by 
a good deal of abuse, and recalled to my recollec- 
tion by the printer's bill. I am of the unpopular 
side, you know, in England because I am a Catholic, 
and in Ireland because I am opposed to revolution- 
ary schemes.' 

Moreover, as Hutton pointed out to him, his 
poetry lacked a certain force which might have 
arrested the ear of a wider public. Besides, his 
choice of Christian themes tended to diminish 
th€ volume of that poetry which appealed to 
a public not always sensible of the real value 
of Christianity, or at least indifferent to the 
thoughts and moods of the pietist. We must 
bear in mind, too, that from 1850 on, Tenny- 
son was the dominant figure in British poetry; 
and that, as Henry Taylor wrote to de Vere in 
1850, Hhere is hardly ever more than one poet 
flourishing at a time, as there is only one 
Prima Donna.' Yet we venture to believe that 
with the coming of a day of larger toleration 

• So little known Is Aubrey Thomas de Vere that he has 
often been confused with his father. Sir Aubrey de Vere 
<1788-1846), author of 'The Duke of Mercla,' 'Julian the 
Apostate,' 'Mary Tudor,' ' The Lamentation of Ireland,' 
some sonnets, etc. This confusion, for example, exists In 
the early volumes of Poole's Index, and in the English 
"Catalogue, 1816-51 ; while in a well-known anthology of 
-world literature the brief sketch of Sir Aubrey Is embel- 
liahed with a portrait of his son ! 



and broader sympathies, the poetry of Aubrey 
de Vere will be more widely read, and a more 
appreciative pixblic will concede to him that 
higher position among the inspired group to 
which he is justly entitled. 

We have already alluded to the friendships 
of Aubrey de Vere. Like Carlyle, he was a 
liero- worshipper; and his heroes were his 
friends. He came early under the spell of 
Wordsworth, and first came to know the old 
bard in London in 1841. A letter to his sister 
gives young de Vere's impressions, from which 
we quote a few sentences. 

'He strikes me as the kindest and most simple- 
hearted old man I know. He talks in a manner 
very peculiar. As for duration, it is from the rising 
up of the sun to the going down of the same. As 
for quality, a sort of thinking aloud, a perpetual 
purring of satisfaction. ... I was at first 
principally struck by the extraordinary purity of 
his language, and the absolute perfection of his 
sentences; but by degrees I came to find a great 
charm in observing the exquisite balance of his 
mind, and the train of associations in which his 
thoughts followed each other. . . . He is the 
voice, and Nature the instrument; and they always 
keep in perfect tune.' 

In 1842, de Vere stayed in Wordsworth's own 
house, — ' the greatest honour,' he declared, ' of 
his life.' For nearly fifty years following the 
death of Wordsworth in 1850, he made an 
annual pilgrimage to the poet's grave. 

De Vere's friendship with Tennyson began in 
1841 or 1842. His contribution to the Tenny- 
son Memoir is of no small importance; and 
Mr. Ward prints some passages from the diaries 
which give us further interesting pictures of 
the future poet laureate. 

'April 17 [1845].— 1 called on Alfred Tennyson, 
and found him at first much out of spirits. He 
cheered up soon, and read me some beautiful Ele- 
gies, complaining much of some writer in "Fraser's 
Magazine" who had spoken of the "foolish facil- 
ity" of Tennysonian poetry, 

'April 18. — Sat with Alfred Tennyson, who read 
MS. poetry to Tom Taylor and me. Walked with 
him to his lawyer's: came back and listened to the 
"University of Women." . . . As I went 
away, he said he would wdllingly bargain for the 
reputation of Suckling or Lovelace, and alluded to 
"the foolish facility of Tennysonian poetry." Said 
he was dreadfully cut up by all he had gone 
through. 

'Maj-^ 9. — Alfred Tennyson came in and smoked 
his pipe. He told us with pleasure of his dinner 
with Wordsworth, — was pleased as well as amused 
by Wordsworth saying to him, "Come, brother 
bard, to dinner, ' ' and taking his arm. . . . ' 

While Wordsworth was de Vere's acknowl- 
edged master in poetry, Newman was his guide 
in religious thought. Yet he was never a 
servile imitator. In 1850, a year before he 
became a Catholic, he thus wrote of Newman, 
who had joined the Roman communion five 
years before : 

'There is, as you say, occasionally an iron hard- 



1905.]

ness in J. Newman; but in him, as in Dante, there 
is also an exquisite and surpassing sweetness, which 
makes me regard the hardness as but that tribute 
of strength and hardihood which accompanies the 
heroic mind. . . . Breadth of mind may not 
be Newman's peculiar excellence, but that is only 
one form of greatness out of many. The only part 
of his mind which 1 do not like is that which comes 
out in his vein of irony.' 

Elsewhere he speaks of Wordsworth and New- 
man as * England's two greatest men of late 
times.' 

The volume abounds in glimpses of other 
great men, — Coleridge, Carlyle, Browning, 
Eichard Monckton Milnes, Sir Henry Taylor, 
Manning, Vaughan, Faber, Gladstone, — a 
group of characters who loom up large on the 
stage of Victorian politics, literature, and 
ecclesiastical history, and most of whom were 
men of remarkable personality. Yet not the 
least of the reader's reward comes from his 
more intimate knowledge of a pure and unself- 
ish life, lived largely in the service of his fel- 
lows: a poet who here reveals himself most 
fully as the patriot and the friend.

From the Seat of ^Var.* 



The titanic struggle for predominance in 
Asia is beginning to have its echoes in books 
brought out in our own country. The feeling 
that the United States is intimately involved 
in the results of the combat is taken for granted 
by the three writers whose books make so impor- 
tant a contribution to the general understand- 
ing of the subject, though the first of them is 
at some pains to demonstrate the reasons for 
America's interest, the others assuming it as a 
f act. 

Dr. K. Asakawa is lecturer on the civiliza- 
tion and histon* of East Asia at Dartmouth 
College; he is a graduate of Yale, and his fit- 
ness for the task of detailing the causes and 
issues of ' The Russo-Japanese Conflict ' is cer- 
tified to by Professor Williams, under whom 
he studied at New Haven. But he required no 
credentials beyond the subject-matter of his 
own narrative, which is a clear and logical pres- 
entation of the cause of his native land, with 
an endeavor to make an unprejudiced state- 
ment of the side of its adversaries also. In the 
latter effort he is as successful as any one could 
reasonably expect, his desire to quote from Rus-

sian authorities wherever they have spoken 
amoimting to solicitude. He accepts tacitly the 
economic interpretation of history up<Hi which 
Karl Marx and his followers insist, proving 
that the vast increase in the population of 
Japan requires an outlet on the Asiatic main- 
land, and setting forth the right and interests 
recently acquired by Japan in both Manchuria 
and Korea. It is easy to glean from these 
showings that the very existence of the nation 
demands a freedom of commercial exchanges 
which Russia is not at all ready to grant since 
her acquisition of Manchuria and her scheming 
for the control of the Korean government. 
Japan is compelled to import large quantities 
of food-stuffs for the support of her population, 
pa\-ment for which can be made only through 
the sale of her factory products. This requires 
an open door in Manchuria, for Japan essen- 
tially, for the United States and Great Britain 
in less degree. Korea is, as the Japanese states- 
man observes, a sword thrust out against Japan 
from the continent, no less than the obvious 
outlet for the surplus population of the island 
empire. It is also an effectual wedge thrust 
into the heart of Russian schemes for the stu- 
pendous theft of Manchuria from China, a 
permanent threat against the reactionary com- 
mercial policy of St. Petersburg. War was 
inevitable; and, the circumstances being what 
they are, peace seems remote. 

Of the broad causes leading up to hostilities. 
Dr. Asakawa tells us little not already known. 
But in details and the marshalling of facts he 
is far fuller than anyone preceding him. He 
is especially solicitous to disavow the imputa- 
tion of revenge for the iniquiiy of Russian 
intervention, in company with France and Ger- 
many, after the war with China, as a casus belli; 
but he shows that this attitude on the part of 
Russia was the means of awakening Japan to 
a sense of the need for warlike preparations. 
As for the diplomatic negotiations immediately 
preceding the war, he is content with showing 
how often Russia had been successful, even with 
Japan itself, in the same sort of policy, though 
he does not lay quite the stress needful on Rus- 
sia's assumption that Japan would not fight — 
that 'the bluff would not be called,' in the 
language of the card-table, which is often the 
logic of diplomacy as well. The book contains 
portraits of the statesmen who figure in its 
pages, and may be taken as a valuable contri- 
bution to contemporary history from the end of 
the war with China through the diplomatic cor- 
respondence immediately following the outbreak 
of hostilities. 

Mr. Frederick Palmer's volume, 'With 
Kuroki in Manchuria,' presents a newspaper 
correspondent's pictures of Japanese readiness 
and skill in warfare, confirming the impressions

already accepted in this country, and leaving 
little doubt that the perfection of Japanese dis- 
cipline and the qualities of Japanese character 
will enable her armies to maintain their posi- 
tion against heavy odds, even though the Kus- 
sians themselves are undergoing a rapid educa- 
tion in military matters. Mr. Palmer was 
present at the crossing of the Yalu River, and 
his story closes with the occupation of Liao- 
Yang: it did not seem possible to him that 
Russia would attempt to retake her position in 
that city, so he failed tO' see one of the greatest 
and most disastrous of Russian repulses. At 
the close of his book, Mr. Palmer indulges 
somewhat in the dubious game of prophecy, and 
his most interesting prognostication follo\\"s: 

'If after repeated attempts Eussia fails, then from 
sheer exhaustion on both sides peace will come. If 
she succeeds, the line of least resistance for her by 
which she can re-establish her prestige in the East 
is to swing in flank upon Peking, while Germany at 
Kiauchou and France in southern China will not say 
her nay. England and America cannot run their 
battleships over the plains of Chi-li. The limit of 
their power is the range of their naval guns, unless 
they land troops. Port Arthur, with her harbor open 
to reinforcements and supplies, is an impregnable 
fortress. Eussia cannot take Port Arthur or Korea 
with Japan in command of the sea. If England and 
the United States are so far negligent of their 
selfish interests as ever to permit Japan to lose com- 
mand of the sea, England will no longer be a power 
in the Far East, and the United States might as 
well cede her Pacific coast to Mexico so far as trade 
or influence on the eastern shores of the Pacific are 
concerned. Eussia 's pride is bitten deep. She 
will have no honest truce with the Anglo-Saxons 
now. Our course is clear.' 

Mr. Palmer believes that if Japan takes Harbin 
the war will abruptly cease, and that an army 
of a million men is needed by Russia to drive 
Japan back to the Korean frontier. His entire 
book is vividly written, and will be found as 
informing as it is interesting in its accounts 
of the actual fighting. Numerous reproduced 
photographs by Mr. Hare add greatly to its 
value. 

If Mr. Palmer's book is taken as proof of 
Japan's capabilities in destructive warfare, that 
of Dr. Seaman, ' From Tokio through ^Man- 
churia with the Japanese,' is equally important 
as showing their constructive and conserving 
qualities. As a military surgeon (attached to 
our armies in the Philippines), Dr. Seaman's 
chief interest naturally lay in the treatment of 
the sick and wounded in times of war, as. well 
as the means taken to prevent sickness in the 
field. The testimony he gives regarding Japan- 
ese science and skill shows that remarkable peo- 
ple to be as far in advance of European and 
American civilization in these respects as they 
appear to be in all others that constitute an 
effective army and navy. Dr. Seaman had some 
interesting experiences in ]\Ianohuria, at Che- 



foo, and in attempting to reach Port Arthur;, 
but prominence is always given to the hospitals 
and medical systems. What he says of the 
health of the Japanese troops is almost incred- 
ible in view of the fact that in the war with 
Spain the United States lost fourteen soldiers 
through preventable disease for every one who. 
died in action, and that Great Britain in 
South Africa, and France in the Madagascar 
expedition, did little better, — or, rather, did 
worse. Listen ! 

' The medical oflicer [Japanese] is omnipresent.. 
You will find him in countless places where in an 
American or British army he has no place. He is 
as much at the front as in the rear. He is with the 
first screen of scouts, with his microscope and chem- 
icals, testing and labelling wells, so that the army 
to follow shall drink no contaminated water. When 
the scouts reach a town, he immediately institutes 
a thorough examination of its sanitary condition,, 
and if contagion or infection is fount! he quaran- 
tines and places a guard around the dangerous dis- 
trict. Notices are posted, so that the approaching: 
column is warned, and no soldiers are billeted' 
where danger exists.' 

The Japanese rank and file seem to be as 
much more cleanly, temperate, and moral than 
the American or British as these last are thaa 
the Russian — which is saying a great deal. 
]Mr. Palmer bears witness to the fact that the 
Japanese armv not only took sanitary care of 
itself, but of all the filth left by its retreating 
advei-saries. Even flies, he observes, disap- 
peared, in spite of the swarming myriads gen- 
erated in Russian squalor and ignorance. Small 
wonder is it that the wards for intestinal and 
contagious diseases in the Japanese hospitals 
are empty, and that, as Dr. Seaman says, ' The 
loss from preventable disease in the first six 
months of the terrible conflict with Russia will 
be but a fraction of one per cent, — this, too, 
in Manchuria, a country notoriously unhealthy.' 
In the Spanish-American war, he notes that 
' The mortality from bullets and wounds was 
268, while that from disease reached the appal- 
ling number of 3,862,' on the American side. 
And in regard to the wounded, an even more- 
remarkable exhibit is made, stated thus: 

'Up to August 1st, 9,862 cases had been received 
at the Eeserve Hospital at Hiroshima, of whom 
6,636 were wounded. Of the entire number up to- 
that time, only 34 had died. Up to July 20th, the 
hospital ship HaJcuii Maru alone brought 2,406 casu- 
alities from the front without losing a case in 
transit. Up to July 1st, 1,105 wounded — a large 
proportion of whom were stretcher cases — were 
received in the hospitals at Tokio; none died, and 
all but one presented favorable prognoses.' 

Such facts as these lend significance to the 
statement of a distinguished Japanese officer 
with whom Dr. Seaman discussed Russia's over- 
whelming numbers. 

' "Yes; we are prepared for that, Eussia may be 
able to place 2,000,000 men in the field. We can

furnish 500,000. You know in every war four men

That will be the position of Bussia in this war. We 
propose to eliminate disease as a factor. Every 
man who dies in our army must fall on the field 
of battle. In this way we shall neutralize the supe- 
riority of Russian numbers and stand on a com- 
paratively equal footing." '

comparing American methods with Japanese,

In the Spring of 1904, I wrote to a corre- 
spondent, a well-known student of municipal 
affairs, that I was about to visit England. In 
replying, he desired me to take note of various 
things, but particularly to notice the terms upon 
which public franchises were being granted in 
that country. It so happened that in the course 
of my visit I met Mr. John Bums, member of 
Parliament and of the London County Council ; 
and to him I referred the question put by my 
correspondent. 'Upon what terms are we 
granting franchises ?' said he ; ' upon no 
terms ! ' — and he proceeded to tell me how 
many cities had taken over their street-cars, 
their water-works, electric-lighting, and what 
not. !Mr. Bums did not exaggerate; municipal 
ownership is in the air of England to-day, and 
as yet there is nothing to show that public con- 
trol is losing favor. When the progressives of 
the London County Council undertook to gov- 
ern the metropolis, so far as their powers per- 
mitted, there were many who predicted disaster. 
The rule of these 'theorists' has indeed cost 
money, but it has produced so many blessings 
that it has won approval, and in spite of abuse 
the result of each election has been a progressive 
victory. The story of the London County Coun- 
cil, with the visible results of its work, are I 
think of more significance than anything else 
in England to-day. 

Such a movement naturally and properly pro- 
duces its own literature. If the judgment of 
contemporary writers is not exactly impartial, 
it is at all events the fruit of genuine mental 
pertui'bation. The thing, whether it appears 
good or bad, has to be dealt with somehow, and 
no writer doubts that his judgment upon it is 
of great moment. The time for mere disdain, 
or even for mere opposition, is past. 

• Municipal Trade. The Advantages and Disadvan- 
tages Resulting from the Substitution of Representative 
Bodies for Private Proprietors in the Management of 
Industrial Undertakings. By Major Leonard Darwin. 
New York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 

The CoiduoK Sense of Municipal Trading. By 
Bernard Shaw. Westminister : Archibald Constable & Co., 
Ltd. 



In this spirit, and quite honestly, does Major 
Darwin discuss Municipal Trade in a work of 
464 pages. His book is the result of much 
research, and is full of interesting information. 
Very conveniently for the reader, the gist of 
each chapter is summed up in a few sentences, 
so that it is possible to get at the main argu- 
ments of the author almost too easily, and the 
impression gathered from the detailed perusal 
of the text may be confirmed by the author's own 
summary. It is stated at the outset that Munic- 
ipal Trade is increasing rapidly, and is more 
extensively undertaken in Great Britain than 
in any other countr}*. Municipal Trade and 
Socialism are said to be products of the same 
forc-es; but this volume has no immediate con- 
cern with the latter. ' The strongest argument 
in favor of [Municipal Trade is that companies, 
looking mainly to making profits, may, in the 
case of monopolies, ignore questions connected 
with public health, morals, order, or conve- 
nience. Municipal Trade is, therefore, undoubt- 
edly right in many cases.' However, there is 
the danger of corruption ; ' a large number of 
voters being in the pay of the State adds greatly 
to the probability of corruption.' Then foUows 
a detailed discussion of various cases, and a 
demonstration of the unreliability of statistics, 
with such statements as these : ' No gain is 
made by Municipal Trade unless a risk is run. 
. . Municipal Trade diminishes competition 
and checks progress. . . Looking to the future, 
a reformed municipal trade should be com- 
pared with a reformed private trade.' The last 
sentence indicates the main position of the 
author, which is that private trade may be so 
reformed and controlled as to serve all public 
purposes as well or better than municipal trade, 
with the exception of certain specified under- 
takings, which it is held shoidd be in public 
hands. 

On the whole. Major Darwin goes so far that 
one wonders why he does not go farther. The 
reason is, apparently, that he cannot escape 
from a certain old-fashioned point of view, bom 
of the orthodox political economy of the last 
century. He cannot see things in their broader 
light, being too much concerned with financial 
profit-and-loss, and too afraid of 'subsidising' 
one class at the expense of the rest, — as if 
private trade did not do this on a gigantic scale ! 
Consequently his book is hailed in certain quar- 
ters as a really scientific demonstration of tiie 
fallacies of modem scwialistic movements; 
whereas it actually affords a remarkable illus- 
tration of the working of the new wine, though 
it be in old bottles. 

It is impossible in a brief review article to 
discuss the arguments pro and con, but refer- 
ence may be made to page 57, where it is urged

THE DIAL. 



[Jan. 1, 



that sentimental considerations cannot be al- 
lowed to weigh in the balance. 

*A feeling of gratification at their city's acMeve- 
ments is felt by most citizens, especially by those 
possessing the municipal franchise, because the 
sentiment that they have a share in the ownership 
and management of large municipal works is 
agreeable to them, even if that share be excessively 
small; and such feelings will create a desire for a 
further increase in the number of the functions to 
be performed by municipalities. But does this 
desire, founded on this feeling, indicate in the 
slightest degree that any such increase in the func- 
tions performed by the state would be beneficial? 
. . . We are considering whether the popularity of 
Municipal Trade proves it to be intrinsically bene- 
ficial; and, as far as popularity depends on mere 
sentiment, it obviously proves nothing.' 

On the contrary, it seems to me that if a given 
municipal enterprise (or anything else) pro- 
duces a feeling of gratification in the minds of 
the citizens, that feeling in itself is an asset of a 
valuable kind, fairly to be set even against 
financial loss. Major Darwin must surely 
admit that even if (as was not stated) the 
gratification of the ' sentiment ' involved some 
loss of money, the exchange might be no rob- 
ber}^, or otherwise he shcftild hesitate the next 
time he buys a ticket to the theatre, or treats 
himself to any innocent form of amusement. 

The American reader will find the use of the 
word ' corporation,' meaning always a public 
body, rather confusing. It will also be recog- 
nized, in comparing American experiences, 
that what will succeed in one place may very 
well fail in another; in other words, the abilil^^ 
of any city to develop the best type of govern- 
ment depends upon the character of its cit- 
izens. At the same time, it has been justly 
urged that public mismanagement sufficient to 
create a national scandal may yet be a small 
thing compared Avith the almost unrecorded 
fruits of private rapacity, — a fact which should 
prevent us from being discouraged by apparent 
failures. 

Mr. Bernard Shaw's little book on ' The Com- 
mon Sense of Municipal Trading ' comes like a 
breath of fresh air to dispel the fogs engendered 
by fruitless controversy. Characteristically, he 
says in his preface: 'I hope nobody will be 
deterred from reading this book by the notion 
that the subject is a dry one. It is, on the con- 
trar}'-, one of the most succulent in the whole 
range of literature.' And so it is, in his hands. 
I am sorry I cannot quote the whole book; any 
mere summary would be inadequate. The fol- 
lowing quotation will best serve to give an idea 
of Mr. Shaw's point of view, and if it is rather 
longer than is usually permitted in a review, I 
think no apology is necessary : 

'Consider the case of a great dock company. 
Near the docks three institutions are sure to be 
found: a workhouse, an infirmary, and a police 
court. The loading and unloading of ships is 



dangerous labor, and to a great extent casual labor, 
because the ships do not arrive in regular numbers 
of regular tonnage at regular intervals, nor does 
the work average itself sufficiently to keep a com- 
plete stafP regularly employed as porters are at a 
railway station. Numbers of men are taken on 
and discharged just as they are wanted, at sixpence 
an hour (in London) or less. This is convenient 
for the dock company; but it surrounds the dock 
with a demoralized, reckless and desperately poor 
population. No human being, however solid his 
character and careful his training, can loaf at the 
street corner waiting to be picked up for a chance 
job without becoming more or less of a vagabond: 
one sees this even in the artistic professions, where 
the same evil exists under politer conditions, as 
unmistakably as in the ranks of casual labor. The 
shareholders and directors do not live near the 
docks, so this does not affect them personally. But 
the rate payers who do live near the dock are 
affected very seriously both in person and pocket. 
A visit to the workhouse and a chat with one of 
the Poor Law Guardians will help to explain mat- 
ters. 

'Into that workhouse every dock laborer can 
walk at any moment, and, by announcing himself 
as a destitute person, compel the guardians to house 
and feed and clothe him at the expense of the rate- 
payers. When he begins to tire of the monotony 
of "the able bodied ward" and its futile labor, 
he can wait until a ship comes in; demand his dis- 
charge; do a day's work at the docks; spend the 
proceeds in a carouse and a debauch; and return t& 
the workhouse next morning, again a destitute per- 
son. This is systematically done at present by num- 
bers of men who are by no means the least intel- 
ligent or capable of their class. Occasionally the 
carouse ends in their being taken to the police sta- 
tion instead of returning immediately to the work- 
house. And if they are unlucky at their work, they 
may be carried for surgical treatment to the infirm- 
ary; for in large docks accidents that require hos- 
pital treatment occur in busy times at intervals of 
about fifteen minutes. Finally, when they are worn 
out, they subside into the workhouse permanently 
as aged paupers until they are buried by the 
guardians. 

'Now workhouses, infirmaries and police courts 
cannot be maintained for nothing. Of late years 
workhouses have become much more expensive; in 
fact the outcry against the increase of the rate, 
which is being so vigorously used to discredit 
municipal trading, is due primarily and overwhelm- 
ingly to Poor Law, and only secondarily to educa- 
tional and police expenditures, and has actually 
forced forward those branches of municipal trading 
which promise contributions out of their profits in 
relief of the general rate. This expenditure out 
of the rates on the workhouse is part of the cost 
of poverty and demoralization; and if these are 
caused in any district by the employment of casual 
labor, and its remuneration at less than subsistence 
rates, then it is clear that a large part of the cost 
of the casual labor is borne by the ratepayer and 
not by the dock company. The dividends, in fact, 
come straight out of the ratepayers' pockets, and 
are not in any real sense profits at all. Thus it is 
one of the many ironies of the situation that the 
sacrifices the ratepayer makes to relieve the poor 
really go largely to subsidize the rich. 

'A municipality cannot pick the ratepayer's 
pocket in this fashion. Transfer the docks to the 
municipality, and it will not be able to justify a 
loss at the workhouse and police station by a profit 
at the docks. The ratepayer does not go into th* 
accounts; all he knows is whether the total number 



1905]

la 



of pence in the pound has risen or fallen. Conse- 
quently the municipality, on taking over the docks, 
wonld be forced to aim in the first instance at 
organizing its work so as to provide steady perma- 
nent employment for its laborers at a living wage, 
even at the cost of being overstaffed on slack days, 
iintil the difBculty had been solved by new organ- 
ization and machinery, as such difficulties always 
are when they can no longer be shirked. Under 
these conditions it is quite possible that the profits 
made formerly by the dock company might disap- 
pear; but if a considerable part of the pauperism 
and crime of the neighborhood disappeared simulta- 
neously, the bargain would be a very profitable one 
indeed for the ratepayers, though the Times would 
abound with letters contrasting the former commer- 
cial prosperity of the dock company with the 
present "indebtedness" of the municipalitv. ' (Pp. 
21-24.)

The Developmext of ax Americ ax 
Literature. * 



Something of a new departure in the machin- 
err for a critical study of our native authors 
is noted in the appearance of three attractive 
volumes forming the beginning of what is 
announced as ' The Wampum Library of Amer- 
ican Literature.' When completed, this enter- 
prise will include ' a series of uniform volumes, 
each of which shall deal with the development 
of a single literary species, tracing the evolu- 
tion of this definite form here in the United 
States, and presenting in chronological sequence 
typical examples chosen from the writings of 
American authors. The editors of the several 
volumes provide critical introductions in which 
they outline the history of the form as it has 
been evolved in the literature of the world.' 
The entire work is under the editorial super- 
vision of Prof. Brander Matthews. We regard 
the plan as timely and useful. If the succeed- 
ing volumes are as capably edited as the three 
now publishd, the series will prove of great 
value in the historical study of our literature, 
and will go far in substantiating the existence 
of a definite body of compositions to which the 
distinctive title of American literature may 
properly and worthily be applied. That there 
is a quality as well as a tone in the work of our 
own authors notably distinct from that of the 
British product is emphasized in at least two 
of the three volumes at hand. 

Xaturally one's attention is drawn to the 
critical essays introducing the selections in the 
several volumes, and to the principles which 
have directed the choice of the specimens pre-

sented. Taking first the volume of Short Sto- 
ries we find that Mr. Baldwin has planned, 
both in his introduction and in Ms illustra- 
tions, to emphasize development. He particu- 
larly states that it is not his purpose to collect 
the best American short stories. Recognizing 
this particular literary development as alto- 
gether an indigenous growth, he notes the 
appearance of Poe's 'Berenice' (1835) as the 
emergence of the definite form. Previous to 
this date lies the period of experiment. Taking 
Irving's ' Eip Van Winkle ' as the initial exam- 
ple, significant in its method of the influence 
of both Addison and Goldsmith, the editor 
points out that the ' sketch,' as Irving correctly 
termed his work, is not identical in form with 
the t}-pe which was to be evolved. As further 
specimens of the productions of this tentative 
period he cites the wonderfully clever tale by 
William Austin, entitled ' Peter Rugg, the 
Missing Man,' — strikingly suggestive in its 
weird symbolism of the maimer of Hawthorne; 
*The French Village,' by James Hall; and 
'The Inroad of the Xabajo,' by Albert Pike. 
The characteristics of the subsequent period-, 
that in which the perfected type becomes appar- 
ent, are illustrated by selections from Haw- 
thorne, Longfellow, Poe, Willis, Mrs. Kirkland, 
Fitz-James O'Brien, Bret Harte, Webster, Bay- 
ard Taylor, H. C. Bunner, and Harold Fred- 
eric. 

In the short story as conceived by Poe, Mr. 
Baldwin finds the perfect model of the new 
form. The definite principles embodied in its 
construction are recognized as harmonisation, 
simplification, and gradation. ' Every detail of 
setting and style is selected for its architectural 
fitness. . . Its contrivance to further the mood 
may be seen in the use of a single physical 
detail as a recurring dominant [like the refrain 
so frequent in his verse] .' ' At best he planned 
a rising edifice of emotional impressions, a 
work of creative, structural imagination.' The 
defining mark of the short story is thus arrived 
at : ' Unity of impression through strict unity 
of form.' The particular tale chosen to rep- 
resent the power of Poe is * The Fall of the 
House of Usher,' — a perfect example of this 
theory in its application. Mr. Baldwin, by the 
way, makes no reference to ' the interest in sit- 
uation,' discussed by Mr. Henry S. Canby in a 
recent number of The Dial.* In a condensed 
and rapid survey of a dozen pages the author 
completes his introduction with an account of 
the literary derivation of the short story from 
the late Greek and Latin romances, through 
the mediaeval tales and the work of the Italian 
and French story writers.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



Upon the same general principle — namely 
to illustrate the progress of its evolution — is 
based the plan of the second volume in the 
series, which deals with the development of the 
critical spirit in American literature. The 
essays selected are wholly upon literary themes, 
and include examples of Dana, Ripley, Emer- 
son, Poe, Margaret Fuller, Lowell, Whitman, 
Whipple, Stedman, Howells, Lanier, and Jamep. 
Mr. Payne's introduction is particularly illumi- 
nating, and may fairly be included with the 
essays which follow, as an illustration of lit- 
erary insight and critical discrimination. The 
natural law of literary development: first the 
creative, then the critical period, is modified 
in the history of American literature by the 
fact that the native beginnings in this country 
were the beginnings not of seedlings but of 
transplanted growths which may develop only 
after the plants have acquired adaptability to 
the new environment. Thus does the author 
account for the retardation of the growth both 
of the creative imagination and of critical per- 
ception among American writers imtil the open- 
ing of the nineteenth century. * It would be 
invidious,' says Mr. Payne, ' to single out any 
one [distinctive writer of that period] as "the 
father of literary criticism " in America. Per- 
haps Bryant would come as near as any to 
deserving that title by virtue of the article [a 
review of Brown's Essay on American Poetry] 
which appeared in The North American Review 
for 1818. . . A better case is made out for 
Richard Henry Dana (1787-1879), who in the 
years 1817-19 contributed to that Review a 
number of lengthy critical studies.' We have 
space to note but few of many interesting 
details which enliven this essay; but the care- 
ful appreciations of Whipple and Lowell shoidd 
be mentioned. Poe is happily, and by no means 
slightingly, referred to as *the enfant terrible 
of American criticism.' Of Lanier Mr. Payne 
remarks, perhaps too mildly, that he ' rather 
forced the relation between poetry and music, 
and his scholarly equipment was inadequate to 
the ambitious task which he set himself in these 
lecture courses which were afterwards made 
into books.' 

In the third volume, which treats of Amer- 
ican familiar verse, Mr. Matthews has departed 
slightly from the plan followed by Mr. Baldwin, 
in that his collection appears to be Hhe first 
attempt to select the best specimens of familiar 
verse by American authors only.' The editor 
has l^een catholic in his choice, for we find selec- 
tions apparently as incongruous as the well- 
worn classic of ' Old Grimes ' and the tender 
lyric ' Auf Wiedersehen,' the children's favorite 
* 'Twas the Night before Christmas/ and ' Pan 
in Wall Street.' Yet upon examination, in 
spite of what at first appears a rather startling 



catholicity in the admission of selections, 
this body of verse as a whole gives a coordi- 
nated and agreeable impression of the sentiment 
and cleverness of American poets in this par- 
ticular field. Mr. Matthews in his introduction 
defines the term Familiar Verse as ' the lyric of 
commingled sentiment and playfulness which 
is more generally and more carelessly called 
vers de societe' and further indicates as re- 
quisite elements in its success the characteristics 
of brevity, brilliancy, and buoyancy. Electing 
to use the more inclusive phrase which he 
employs in his title, he finds that the familiar 
verse in English literature, including the work 
of British and American poets, is as rich as 
that existing in French literature and probably 
superior to the latter. American familiar verse 
proves to be ' less often a song of Society itself 
than is its British rival; it has a little less of 
the mere glitter of wit and perhaps a little 
more of the mellower tenderness of humor. It 
shrinks less from a homely theme; and it does 
not so often seek that flashing sharpness of 
outline, which Praed delighted in and which 
sometimes suggests fireworks at midnight.' 
Holmes, Saxe, Eugene Field, and Henry Cuy- 
ler Bunner, together with Stedman and Aldrich 
among living poets, are recognized as our most 
conspicuous masters in this form of verse. 

From the character of these three volumes 
it is evident that the series when complete will 
place in their proper proportions the successive 
steps in the evolution of these distinct literary 
forms, — a desirable thing to accomplish, and 
one not easily achieved in a single volume of 
cssais. The one unfortunate feature in the 
general plan of the library is the arbitrary 
restriction which prohibits a selection from 
any living American writers whose birth has 
occurred since December 31, 1850; while selec- 
tions are included from living authors born 
before that date, and from others who were 
born later but who are now dead. Inasmuch 
as the work is planned not to exploit our writers 
but to illustrate and record the development 
of our literature in its various forms, this illogi- 
cal rule must prove imnecessarily embarrassing 
to the editors and often unfair to the reader.

'First Aid for the After-Dinner Speaker' might 
have been the title of a little book compiled by 
Mr. John Home, and more modestly styled by him 
'Starting Points.' It is a collection of 'sentences 
sifted from authors of to-day and yesterday,' and 
designed to offer a bait to the mind oppressed with 
the necessity of saying something in public, and 
having not the least idea how to begin. The selec- 
tion is catholic enough, in all conscience; Ruskin 
jostles with Mr. J. K. Jerome, and Erasmus with 
Mr. John Huntley Skrine — whoever the gentleman 
may be. As the editor remarks, 'A commonplace 
to-day may be an archangel's blast to-morrow.'

One of the noteworthy achievements of mod- 
em psychology is its demonstration of the part 
played in shaping human lives by the uncon- 
scious or sub-conscious factors in the mental pro- 
cess. The poets have known this truth intui- 
tively for years, but it has remained for the 
men of science to establish it by experiment. 
■'The Undercurrent,' a new novel by Mr. Robert 
•Grant, offers us a concrete illustration of this 
principle as applied to a special case. His theme 
is the very modem problem of the divorce evil, 
and he shows us how the undercurrent of emo- 
tion eventually triumphs over reason, and sweeps 
away the intellectual objections which stand in 
the path of a woman's happiness. The situation 
is subtly handled, and one of the oldest of stories 
thereby acquires new distinction. It is the 
familiar story of marriage without much thought, 
the husband's rapid development into a vulgar 
Tjrute, and his final desertion of wife and chil- 
<lren. Then the right man appears upon the 
scene, and the deserted wife is torn by the con- 
flict between desire and dutj'. The plea of duty

society, and their argument convinces her intel-

action, we become conscious of a ehUling of 
the moral atmosphere, and a lowering of the 
heroine in our esteem. Of course, this method of 
dealing with the difficulty is a hundred times 
more honest than the artificial expedient of the 
husband's timely death, which most novelists 
would find adequate, but we cannot help feeling 
that the writer tips his moral balance the wrong 
Avay, and that the clergyman's 'One wearies of 
this everlasting demand for happiness in this 
life,' strikes a deeper note than can be heard 
in the protestations of the lovers. 

Mr. Joseph A. Altsheler has deserted the field 
of warfare for that of present-day journalism 
and politics, and has given us in his 'Guthrie of 
the Times' an interesting and straightforn'ard 
story of modem life— 'a story of success,' he 
calls it, and the description is true in more senses 
than one. The scene of the novel is a state un- 
named, but easily identifiable as Kentucky; the 
hero is a newspaper writer of resource and high 
ideals ; the heroine is a young woman who has to 
become re- Americanized after a life spent main- 
ly abroad. How the hero defeats the attempt to 
impeach a public officer in the interests of a cor- 
rupt financial enterprise, how the heroine, wit- 
nessing, admires, and how in the end he wins both 
her love and an unexpected nomination for Con- 
gress, are the chief matters which enlist our 
interest. Incidentally, we are given a vivid pic- 
ture of a Kentucky mountain feud, in which the 
hero plays a part. The whole story is told to 
direct and workmanlike effect, and illustrates not 
only the practice of journalism as exhibited by 
the leading figure, but also the characteristic lit- 
erarj' qualities which journalism of the better 
type develops in its professional followers. 

Two novels of the Civil War demand a place 
in our present selection. Mr. Henry Kitchell 
Webster's 'Traitor and Loyalist' is a straight- 
forward storj' of blockade-running in the early 
days of the conflict. The scene of operation is 
the course from Nassau to Wilmington, and the 
author has thoroughly informed himself upon 
the technical details of the trade. His hero 
is the captain of a merchantman who goes into 
the risky business because it is his father's 
business, because that father is a New York 
copperhead of rabid prejudices, and because the 
son, having been brought up to obey his father's 
orders, does not give much thought to the polit- 
ical and patriotic considerations involved. The 
heroine is the daughter of a secessionist leader 
of North Carolina, and it devolves uf)on the hero 
to take her as a passenger when he runs the 
blockade with his consignment of supplies. It 
is his love for her that eventually opens his eyes 
to the fact that he is betraying his countrj', and 
her trust in his essential integrity that leads 
him to give up his trade and give his serxdces 
to the imperiled nation. This he is about to do 
when the storj- ends. The work is cleverly done 
upon conventional lines, and has both breeziness 
and \'igor. 

'Manassas,' by Mr. Upton Sinclair, is a very 
different sort of book, having for its purpose 
not entertainment, but instruction and the

[Jan. ly 



revivifying of the intense emotions of the years 
preceding the Avar. It is only fair at the outset 
of our comment to give warning that it has a 
hero but no heroine. Although absolutely devoid 
of the love interest, which is not even hinted at 
in the course of these four hundred pages, it 
is one of the most thrillingly interesting books 
of its kind that we have ever read. We are not 
quite sure that it even has a hero, for the leading 
character, whose life is portrayed for us from 
childhood up, does not become a man of action 
until the very close, but is presented to us 
throughout as one in whose mind and feelings 
are reflected the interests and the passions of 
the period of anti-slavery agitation. The real 
drama of the book is the historical clash of the 
two civilizations, and individuals seem to be made 
use of only by way of incidental illustration. The 
hero, if we may so call him, is reared upon a 
Mississippi plantation which will eventually fall 
to him as an inheritance. When still a boy, he 
is taken to Boston, and there educated. He does 
not lose sympathy for his own people as a 
result of this removal, but his eyes are opened to 
the horrors of slavery, and he realizes that when 
the struggle comes it will be his duty to stand 
by the union. As the fundamental cause of that 
struggle slavery is emphasized, and rightly, as 
all-important. In the course of the narrative we 
are made acquainted with the workings of the 
Underground Railroad, the mobbing of abolition- 
ists, the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law 
in Boston and elsewhere, and John Brown's mad 
enterprise at Harper's Ferry. We are also given, 
although not taken to the scene, vivid accounts 
of the border warfare in Kansas, of the great 
slavery debates in the Senate, of the dastardly 
assault upon Sumner, and nearly every other 
matter affecting the slavery issue during the 
fifties. In fact, the reader, if he stops to think 
at all, must soon realize that what he is reading 
is not fiction at all, but a consecutive and almost 
documentary history of the period. It is his- 
tory written with warmth and an eye for dra- 
matic effect, to be sure, but it is nevertheless 
essentially history. It is the author's triumph that 
his readers are not likely to think very much 
about such things, so enthralling has he made his 
pages. It is only near the close that Sumter is 
fired upon, and the war begun. Then we get a 
few impressionist snap-shots of the excitement in 
both sections, a hurried account of the scenes 
of confusion in and about Washington, a glimpse 
of the new President as he seemed in those first 
days of trial to the men who had been too bewil- 
dered to take his true measure, and finally, the 
rout at Bull Run from the standpoint of the hero, 
a private in his first engagement. This battle 
episode suggests 'The Red Badge of Courage,' 
only it seems to be better done. And here, hav- 
ing brought us just over the verge of actual con- 
flict, the book ends— ends where most novels of 
the Civil War begin. It is a work deserving of 
very high praise. It does not treat its histoi-y 
as a spectacle simply, but has the rare quality of 
arousing our emotions almost to the pitch of those 
that made the war inevitable, and of enabling 



us of a later generation to feel the passion of 
those great past days when conscience counted 
for something in our polities, and Avhen a worthy 
cause evoked our noblest national energies. 

A fastidious man of letters, whose life has- 
never been ruffled by anything more serious than 
the clash of conversational wits or the contro- 
versies of the critical pen, is one day crossing 
the Bay of San Francisco on a ferry-boat. The 
Bay is. foggy, but he has no thought of danger 
until the ferry is suddenly struck amidships and 
speedily sunk. The cause of the mishap is an 
outward-bound sealer, and upon this craft the 
victim of the collision finds himself after he is 
restored to consciousness. He then discovers to 
his consternation that he is in for a voyage of 
several months to the coast of Japan and Kams- 
chatka, and that he has ceased to be even a free 
agent. The captain of the sealer, it appears, is 
a brute of violent disposition who is a law imto 
himself, and this autocrat decrees that the new 
passenger shall sign as cabin-boy, 'for the good 
of his soul,' as the Sea- Wolf grimly remarks. 
Since this person has a rough and ready way of 
enforcing his arguments by a free use of his fists,, 
and since the newlj-rescued man has then and 
there a convincing object-lesson of the validity 
of this method of reasoning, the views are per- 
force accepted, and he faces for the first time- 
in his career the realities of life. From this jDoint 
on, the book becomes a tale of the sea, and of 
the daily routine of a floating hell. The Sea- 
Wolf is the incarnation of sheer animalism, the 
vigor of his physical frame matched by the 
strength of his will, and capable of every sort of 
brutality. He is also— and this is the curious 
thing about him— by way of being a philosopher; 
he reads Spencer and Browning, and interprets 
them by the light of a vigorous and unsophis- 
ticated intellect. Of ethical obligations he has 
no notion whatever, being a very startling em- 
bodiment of Nietzsche's ideal of the Uehermensch. 
Nothing like a scruple is ever known to him, and 
he is in equal measure hated and feared by his 
men. Under this rough tutelage the man of let- 
ters turned ship's drudge learns many things not 
set down in the books, and develops a strength 
and a resourcefulness that he would othenvise 
never have known. Thus the story becomes essen- 
tially an account of the development of charac- 
ter under extraordinary conditions, and its aspect 
as a narrative of adventure is obscured by 
its aspect as a psychological study. It is not a 
pleasant tale to read— it is too strongly seasoned 
to be that,— but it acquires a certain fascination 
in the course of its telling, and fairly grips the 
attention in its culminating passages. 

Mr. Crawford 's technique becomes, if anything,. 
more refined with each new work that he puts 
forth, but his substance grows thinner than ever. 
A forced and mechanical invention marks the 
plot of 'Whosoever Shall Offend,' and the charac- 
ters are but slightly modified variations of the 
types that he has been fashioning for the past 
score of years. The new novel is concerned, with 
a polished villain, who murders his Avife and seeks 
to murder his stepson, all with the sordid object

of gaining their fortune for himself, and in the 
end is trapped and punished according to his 
deserts. It is all very cleverly managed, but the 
interest is of the mildest. 

In 'The Farm of the Dagger/ Mr. Eden 
Phillpotts resorts to the scene, the period, and 
even the special theme of his 'American Pris- 
oner.' Once more we are taken to rural Dart- 
moor in the early nineteenth century, and once 
more we are made acquainted with the grim 
walls of the Prince Town prison. By way of a 
variation, however, the hero is not an American 
prisoner but an English gentleman, although one 
of our captured fellow-eountrj-men plays an 
important part in the story. The "substance of the 
book is a Montague and Capulet feud imder 
English skies, ending, unlike that of Terona, with 
the happy union of the lovers. The parents are 
sacrificed instead, which is much more satisfac- 
tory. 

Ml". Hall Caine has chosen to entitle his new 
novel, 'The Prodigal Son.' The scene is Ice- 
land, used by the author as the stage-setting for 
one of his earlier novels. His 'Prodigal Son' 
is a despicably weak person, pleasure-loving, and 
incapable of resisting temptation. He becomes 
morally responsible for his wife's death through 
neglect coupled with infatuation for another 
woman. He goes abroad, breaks the most solemn 
pledges, becomes a gambler and a cheat, and 
forges his father's name. But with all these sins 
to his account, he develops into a musical genius, 
assumes a new name, and wins both wealth and 
fame. Returning to Iceland, he becomes fully 
acquainted with the misery he has wrought, and 
makes what tardy reparation is still within his 
power. The story shows a confused sense of 
moral values, and fairly reeks with cheap sen- 
timentality. Its style is common and its situa- 
tions theatrical. Altogether it is a poorer per- 
formance than was to be expected even from 
the author of 'The Christian' and 'The Eter- 
nal aty.' 

The new novel of Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim 
is called 'The Betrayal.' Its hero is an impe- 
cunious pedagogue of refined sensibilities but 
imfortunate parentage. Its heroine is the daugh- 
ter of a noble lord whose chief public interest is 
the development of a plan for the defence of 
the nation against foreign invasion. This plan 
requires the utmost secrecy, and the committee 
in charge hit upon the obscure pedagogue as the 
proper person to act as their secretary. He is 
scrupulously honest and painstaking, but despite 
his best efforts the plans of the committee some- 
how leak out and are sold to the enemy. The 
mystery lasts a long while, and is finally solved 
by the revelation that the duke who is the head 
of the organization is the traitor, having fallen 
into a financial pit, and seeking to recoup his 
fortunes b^' these infamous means. In the end, 
his treachery discovered, he conveniently com- 
mits suicide, the hero and heroine marry, and 
the skies are once more clear. The story is ani- 
mated and exciting, and the leading characters 
are limned with a considerable degree of skill. 



•The Closed Book,' by Mr. William Le Queux, 
is undeniably a 'shocker,' but it is fairly well 
wi-itten, and the plot is striking. It concerns two 
buried treasures — the jewels of Luerezia Borgia 
and the plate of Crowland Abbey. A mediaeval 
manuscript written by an Italian monk discloses 
the secret of both, and nearly puts an end to the 
lives of several people, its leaves being impreg- 
nated w-ith the mysterious poison of the Borgias. 
The quest for the treasure is pursued by two rival 
sets of discoverers, which makes the story very 
exciting. The main lines of the narrative are 
worked out to a tolerably satisfactory conclusion, 
but several threads that promise to be important 
are dropped during the process, and we are left 
in dark perplexity concerning the connection with 
the plot of several of the secondary figures. 

Mr. Mason's novels are apt to be loose-jointed, 
and based upon somewhat unnatural situations. 
The leading character of 'The Truants' is an 
Englishman who, having done nothing in particu- 
lar to justify his existence, is afraid that his wife 
will come to feel contempt for him, and so resorts 
to the device of leaving her until he shall have 
achieved fortune or reputation upon the score of 
his personal merits. His first effort is made in 
America, where he falls among thieves. Then he 
ships as a common sailor on a North Sea trawler, 
and gets a taste of rough life. But this does not 
seem to lead to anything, so he finally enlists in 
the French Foreign Legion, does hard service in 
Algiers, and wins distinction for his bravery. The 
real fact of the matter is that he should not have 
left his wife at all, for she is of the kind that is 
sure to seek consolation— a trait of which he was 
fairly warned before he went away. When he 
learns, in his African camp, that she is on the 
point of finding and accepting consolation for his 
desertion, he becomes a deserter himself, escapes 
through Morocco to the coast, and returns to 
Europe just in time to thwart the villain who 
has designs on his honor. There is a good deal 
of variety about this romance, but it is not a yeiy 
oiganic piece of work. The best part of it is 
that devoted to the Foreign Legion, of which the 
author seems to have made a special study. It is 
fairly new ground for the average reader, in spite 
of that 'soldier of the legion' who 'lay dying at 
Algiers,' and whose story is embalmed in one of 
the most familiar pieces of sentimental verse. 

Mr. Marriott's new novel, 'Genevra,' is a study 
of a woman's temperament, framed in the Cor- 
nish setting that the author knows so well how to 
describe. The story has as little as possible of 
the dramatic ; a few other people have to be intro- 
duced as foils to the principal figure; there must 
even be a man capable of awakening her love, for 
otherwise her character would be only half 
revealed. She is one of those self-repressed 
women whom few understand; except for one 
unguarded hour she keeps the citadel of her soul 
from invasion. The traditions of her race are 
dignified, and her life remains in keeping with 
them, even when beset by the vulgarities of a 
shrewish sister-in-law and a sleek suitor. Only in 
her poems does she offer her soul for the inspec-

tion of others, and those who surround her are 
blind to any revelation of that kind. The man to 
whom she yields herself for a time proves a crea- 
ture of common clay (although a famous artist), 
and the tragedy that comes with her realization 
of that fact leaves her spirit chastened but 
unbroken. Her life-story is a tapestry of severe 
•design and sombre hue; the life is her own, not 
another's, and we are left in no doubt that it 
must remain so in the unrecorded years to come. 

'The Divine Fire' is a title that fairly sug- 
gests the theme of Miss May Sinclair's novel, 
which is a full-length study of the poetic tem- 
perament, framed in a varied and curiously inter- 
esting environment, and drawn with a firmness of 
hand that excites one's admiration. Who Miss 
Sinclair may be we know not, but if this is her 
first novel, she has made a promising beginning. 
The work has six hundred closely printed pages, 
and they are none too many for the delight of the 
reader. The poet whose fortunes are followed 
through all this maze is no abstract creation of 
sentimental fancy, but a man of flesh and blood, 
a man, moreover, placed amid the most depress- 
ing surroundings— a London bookshop, a Blooms- 
bury boarding-house, and the fellowship of semi- 
bohemian journalistic life. He is a cockney by 
breeding and circumstance, and he struggles des- 
perately to preserve his aspirates. But with all 
this he is a poet, and his genius forces its Avay to 
self-expression. The author is daring enough to 
give us an occasional illustration of his poetical 
powers, which is rather unwise, because the son- 
nets she prints, although tolerable imitations of 
Eossetti, are by no means up to the level of such 
a genius as she describes. Of the purification 
of this genius, and of the moral quixotism of the 
poet's life, this book is one long and minutely- 
■detailed chronicle. It rises, moreover, to real dis- 
tinction of style, besides being of absorbing inter- 
est from cover to cover. It is the sort of book 
that one begins by skimming, and ends by giving 
the closest attention to paragraph and phrase. 

Granting the initial possibility of two men so 
•closely resembling one another as to deceive their 
closest friends— and even the wife of the one 
who is married— granting this, there is no further 
difficulty of an insuperable nature in accepting 
the plot of Mrs. Thurston's 'The Masquerader. ' 
Of the two men who agree to exchange identities, 
one is a gifted but obscure person ; the other is a 
rising statesman, a member of Parliament, and a 
leader of the opposition. Unfortunately, he is 
also a morphino maniac, and he provides himself 
with an official substitute in order that he may 
retire from the world from time to time for 
indulgence in the vice which has mastered him. 
The man who impersonates him upon these occa- 
sions develops a genius for politics, and eventu- 
ally leads his party to power. Incidentally, he 
falls in love with the wife of the man for whom 
he thus acts as a substitute, and the wife unsus- 
peetedly finds herself caring for her husband; 
that is, for the man whom she believes to be her 
husband. Here is where the author takes the bull 
by the horns and grows audacious in her inven- 
tion. For when the wife makes discovery of the 



imposture, she is not outraged, as a conventional 
heroine would be, but remains faithful to her 
newly-awakened affections. This difficult relation 
is treated with a delicacy that can give no offense, 
but the moralist is sure to find in the denoument 
a stumbling-block. For when the real husband 
dies of an overdose of morphine, and the lovers 
are left to face the future, they decide that their 
feelings for each other constitute the all-impor- 
tant factor in the perplexing situation, and that it 
is best for them to continue the imposture indefi- 
nitely, without regard to such unimportant mat- 
ters as property and inheritance. It is a con- 
elusion to take one's breath away, but it at least 
offers a refreshing contrast to the artificial 
means that any other novelist would have devised 
for getting out of the difficulty. And the story 
is so ingeniously told and cleverly constructed 
that its very boldness is in a measure justified.

Essays hy 
the hermit of 
^helbume. 



In no dilettante spirit does 
Mr. Paul Elmer More approach 
his task of criticism. Two years 
of solitary meditation in a secluded spot on the 
Androscoggin, where the recluse lived much after 
the manner of Thoreau at Walden, revealed to 
him that his work was to be the criticism of 
others' writings, not the production of master- 
pieces of his own. 'Shelburne Essays: First 
Series' (Putnam) is a collection of literary, 
psychological, and ethical studies, of unusual 
seriousness and power. The first essay is on 
Thoreau, but our forest hermit is no natui-alist; 
he respects nature 's secrets, and refrains from the 
botanist's and entomologist's and ornithologist's 
prying curiosity. To the problems of the soul, 
as presented in literature and life, he devotes his 
energies. An excellent study of Hawthorne 
dwells on the romancer's loneliness and pictures 
the inevitable solitariness of every soul as the 
theme that most poAverfully appealed to the 
creator of Hester Prynne and Ethan Brand and 
Hepzibah Pyncheon. An essay on Emerson is per- 
haps all the better for being not wholly in sym- 
pathy with the Transcendentalist. Appropriately 
enough thei-e follows a chapter on Carlyle, in 
which the writer says some things that have not 
been said before, but allows himself to assume as 
beyond dispute that Carlyle 's marriage was a 
'pathetic tragedy,' and even does his part toward 
increasing the pathos. After this one is not 
unprepared to find him calling Froude's life of 
Carlyle 'one of the two great biographies of the 
language,' the other of course being Boswell's 
Johnson. A somewhat minute study of Mr. 
Arthur Symons's decadent verse would seem a 
waste of energy except for the psychological 
interest to be found in these poems, as the essay- 
ist observes, by those that are curious to follow 
the varied currents of modern thought. In the 
recent Irish literary revival, Mr. More, 'wearied 
of the imperialistic arrogance of Kipling the

gi-eat and the lesser Kiplings, ' had hoped to find 
the promise of better things ; but he is somewhat 
disappointed, a note of defeat seeming to him 
predominant in the tones given forth by Erin's 
harp. In other words, it is decadence we again 
meet with here, though quite a different one from 
the decadence of a Baudelaire or a Symons. 
Count Tolstoy is to our author a false prophet, 
in whose humanitarianism he sees nothing but the 
'vicious circle of attempting to unite men for the 
mere sake of union. ' Yet surely the connotations 
of * brotherly love ' forbid its interpretation as an 
empty end in itself. Discussing the religious 
ground of humanitarianism, Mr. More distin- 
guishes between unworldly or religious motives 
and those impulses that properly apply to the 
daily life and conduct of the world 's i>eople ; and 
he maintains that 'to intrude the aspirations of 
faith and hope and the ethics of the golden rule 
of love' into worldly affairs is *a mischievous 
folly.' Is religion then to be merely for Sunday 
use, and a cloistered virtue the only one practic- 
able? Perhaps something more of the spirit and 
less of the letter of religion may help toward solv- 
ing the diflSculty. Our essayist may be thought at 
times to take himself and his hermit experience, 
and his ' long course of wayward reading, ' a little 
too seriously. But he is not yet old, and he has a 
right to enjoy the seriousness of youth while it 
lasts. Poets, too, are seldom richly endowed with 
humor; and Mr. More is not unknown as a poet, — 
indeed, his essays are embellished here and there 
with verses of his own. chiefly translations. A 
constant tendency to find analogies in Hindu liter- 
ature is conspicuous in this ex-professor of 
Sanskrit. However, he has certainly read widely 
and wisely, and his essays are unquestionably full 
of meat. 

The third volume of Mr. 
Andrew Lang's 'Historv of 
Scotland' (Dodd, Mead &'Co.), 
has to do with the period from the accession of 
Charles I. to the end of Argj-U's rising, 1G25 to 
1688. The impression received from this work is 
that the author is not attempting to write a 
formal history of Scotland, but is rather using 
the materials he has collected and studied to test 
the accuracy of earlier works by well-known 
authors. The result is that while those who are 
intimately familiar with the details of Scottish 
historj' will find Mr. Lang intenselj' interesting 
as a critic and as a shrewd investigator, uncover- 
ing new sources of information, the ordinary 
reader must frequently be puzzled to understand 
the connection and relation of events. The 
author takes for granted his reader's knowledge 
of the general course of Scottish history, even to 
the extent of omitting any general outline. His 
most striking characteristic is his dispassionate, 
judicial, possibly even cynical, attitude towards 
persons and incidents in relation to the contests 
over religion with Charles I. Thus he writes of 
the Covenant by which Scotch Presbyterians 
bound themselves to resist the liturgj- of Charles 
I. : * Scotland was once more in the happy pos- 
ture of Israel of old, and enjoyed a definite legal 
instrument, binding on all posterity, and regulat-

ing the relations between itself and the Creator 
of the universe. Nothing was absent but the sig- 
nature of the other high contracting party. ' * The 
friends of freedom, as ever, allowed ru> freedom 
to any but themselves. The zealots of liberty of 
conscience permitted no liberty of conscience to 
exist among persons of other opinions. In what 
respect their conduct was better than the king's 
(which was as bad as possible) it is diflScult to 
discover; but historians usually prefer the cause 
of popular to that of individual tyranny. ' * They 
[the Covenanters] on the other hand, to repeat 
Mr. Gardiner's eloquent words, "had long been 
led astray, and had now returned to the Shepherd 
and Bishop of their Souls"; not only so, they 
butted other sheep who would not enter the 
fold.' It may be doubted whether a mental tem- 
I>er and attitude so far removed from the intense 
religious feeling of the time of which he is writ- 
ing, does not preclude an author from really 
undei"standing and judging fairly the men of that 
time. But in respect to exact statement of doubt- 
ful events at least, Mr. Lang's work is a fine 
example of modem scholarship, being based on a 
careful analysis of the documents and other 
sources available for the study of Scottish his- 
tory. 

After all the years Mr. John 
Burroughs has devoted to the 
study of birds, it is not strange 
that he has learned to borrow some of their ways. 
His latest volume of essays, 'Far and Near' 
(Houghton), tells how he has taken to himself 
wings and flitted as far as Alaska for one season, 
and to Jamaica for another. On these flights 
his bird-like keenness of vision has served him 
well, and the messages he brings back are good to 
listen to. Among the specialists of the Harriman 
Alaska Expedition of 1899, Mr. Burroughs was, 
so to speak, a generalist; yet he had enough spe- 
cial knowledge in many fields to report with zest 
the discoveries made by the 'fiends' in rocks, 
plants, glaciers, birds, and bears. Meanwhile he 
kept his eye on the landscape, and tells the 
untravelled reader what he most wants to know, 
and tells it in his own expressive way. The hills 
of Wj'oming are 'almost as plump and muttony 
in places as the South DoAvns of England'; in 
the Bad Lands, 'the earth seems to have been 
flayed alive, — no skin or turf or verdure or vege- 
table mould anywhere, — all raw and quivering.' 
Alaska itself 'is covered with an unbroken carp)et 
of verdure. . . . Green, white, and blue are the 
three prevailing tints all the way from Cook Inlet 
to Unalaska; blue of the sea and sky, green of 
the shores and lower slopes, and white of the 
lofty p>eaks and volcanic cones, — they are min- 
gled and contrasted all the way.' True to his 
northern instinct, Mr. Burroughs finds Jamaica 
a place 'cursed with perpetual summer,' and com- 
plains that he cannot make love to Nature there. 
'Nature in the tropics has little tenderness or 
winsomeness. She is barbaric; she is painty and 
stiff; she has no sentiment; she does not touch 
the heart ; she flouts and revels and goes her own 
way like a wanton. She has never known adver- 
sity; she has no memory and no longing; there is

no autumn behind hei- and no spring beiore.' 
Nevertheless, no blossom of southern woods, no 
significant feature of the land, no bird-note, no 
star new to northern eyes, escapes this treasurer 
of beauty. But after all, it is in the interludes of 
^Near' between these two themes of the 'Far' 
that we find Mr. Burroughs most himself. The 
nature-lover who writes the little comedy of the 
water-thrush family, and the little tragedy of the 
frozen baby rabbits, is the same who long ago 
won our hearts with stories of similar home-hap- 
penings. The records of far journeys in this new 
book may not add greatly to his reputation, but 
they serve the gracious purpose of showing us an 
old friend in new surroundings. 



Sheridan and To the already extensive list 
the closing days of historical monographs relat- 
or the Civil War. ^^^ ^^ the period of the Civil 
War there is added a sprightly and vivid account 
of the operations which brought that war to a 
•close, namely, the eleven days' operations from 
March 29 to April 8, 1865, by Sheridan and his 
cavalrymen in front of Petersburg and Richmond. 
This is from the pen of Brevet Brigadier-General 
Henry E. Tremain, and is entitled 'Last Hours of 
Sheridan's Cavalry' (Bonnell, Silver & Bowers). 
General Tremain was himself as aide-de-camp to 
General Crook, an active participant in many of 
the scenes which he here describes. He has com- 
piled his book from notes taken by him on the 
field, which have heretofore been published in the 
newspaper press, and have been subjected to the 
comment and criticism of other actors in the 
same drama, much of which is here reproduced 
and made appendant to the principal narrative. 
The result is an unusually valuable compilation 
of contemporary notes. In quite full detail, and 
occupying over 400 pages, the writer carries his 
readers rapidly, but not too hastily, through the 
vicissitudes of an exciting campaign. This is the 
campaign in which it has been said that 'Grant 
commanded both his own and Lee 's army. ' Sheri- 
dan 's work in weaving the final toils around the 
fated Confederacy is here graphically narrated, 
and the reader has an hourly view of the keen 
insight and circumspection with which the great 
commander performed the task for which he was 
summoned from the Valley of Virginia. When 
the evening of April 6 is reached, and one reads 
again Sheridan's terse despatch to Grant, 'If the 
thing is pressed, I think Lee will surrender,' and 
when the next day sees the Federal pursuit of 
Lee more warm and eager than ever, the reader 
is prepared to share Sheridan's confidence in the 
expected result. . 

There is considerable 'bite' in 
Mr. Frank Moore Colby's 
short essays, 'Imaginary Obli- 
gations' (Dodd, Mead & Co.), as those who have 
read them in 'The Bookman' and elsewhere can 
testify. Mr. Colby possesses a good measure of 
shrewd sense, a wholesome hatred of humbug and 
a keen eye to detect it, a practised pen, and a 
knack of terse, incisive, and often striking expres- 
sion. But with these qualities go their defects: 
aiming to be brilliant and sententious, he occa- 



A dogmatic 
essayist. 



sionally exaggerates and makes phrases. The 
modesty of careful utterance is shocked by such 
an assertion as that 'false hvunor-worship is the 
deadliest of social sins'; and the writer illus- 
trates the vice he on another page inveighs 
against (phrase-making) Avhen he allows the fol- 
lowing to escape his pen : ' There is nothing more 
amazing to the reader than the way a mind can be 
wrapped in a "policy." Many a decorous news- 
paper is edited by a moral papoose. In private 
life ' ' the policy ' ' would make you talk in epitaphs 
of last year's opinions, hook your fancy to a 
foregone conclusion, turn your mind into a bare 
card-catalogue of the things you used to think.' 
A vocabulary is a fine thing, and so is a small 
boy's new drum; but so also is moderation. How- 
ever, Mr. Colby is still a young man. Perhaps 
when he is older he will not bristle with so many 
positive convictions, and possibly he will express 
himself more often in the form of query and sug- 
gestion. The neutral tints of doubt may tend 
now and then to displace the glaring primarj' 
colors of certitude. Something of Charles Lamb's 
'twilight of dubiety' will perchance soften his 
mental horizon-line, as he sits, pen in hand, enter- 
taining us with his views de omnibus rebus et 
quibusdam aliis. Some of his best chapters have 
to do with 'The Business of Writing' and 'Liter- 
ary Compulsion.' 'The Literary Temperament' 
is treated in a way that makes the reader, if he 
be also a Avriter, squirm in his chair. ' The Temp- 
tation of Authors' contains a wai'ning to success- 
ful and pi'olific writers. 'The danger in spread- 
ing one's self thin is that the time surely comes 
when it is done unconsciously. A man thinks it 
is his thought flowing on like that, when it is only 
his ink.' The fitness of Mr, Colby's title, 'Imagi- 
nary Obligations,' is somewhat imaginary, in 
spite of his explanation in the preface. But a 
book must have a title, and for a collection of 
loosely related essays one will serve about as well 
as another. 

Among the subjects rescued 
from vague speculations and 
transfeiTed to the field of 
descriptive inquirj^ none is more inviting, and 
also more baffling, than the nature of personality. 
The change of front which modern psychology 
presents in contrast with older points of view 
has been active in this field, and has made it evi- 
dent that personality, like other eomjilexes of 
psychological processes, is itself the result of 
growth and accordingly may be subject to var- 
ious lapses and degeneration. A recent work by 
Dr. Boris Sidis and Dr. Simon P. Goodhart, 
entitled 'Multiple Personality, an Experimental 
Investigation into the Nature of Human Individ- 
uality' (Appleton), represents both the kinds of 
inquiry and the nature of the results typical of 
the modern point of view. The most original as 
well as most interesting portion of the volume is 
given over to a painstaking account of a 
remarkable loss of personality, in many respects 
the most complete on record. It is the most com- 
plete, not only because so large a portion of the 
normal mental processes Avere lost, reducing the 
subject to a condition of a curiously modified 



TJie nature of 
Personality.

infancy, but also because the new personality has 
been so interestingly developed by education, and 
ultimately united with the old. On the basis of 
this and similar cases, certain of which justify 
the title of 'Multiple Personality,' these investi- 
gator indicate the contribution of these abnormal 
forms toward the right understanding of the 
nature of personality. While this xmderstanding 
is by no means complete or easily summarized, 
the trend of the results is such as to lay emphasis 
up>on the normal participation of the sub-con- 
scious activities in the formation of that memory- 
continuum by which the material fgr the sense 
of personality is supplied. Equally do such inves- 
tigations discountenance the supernatural and 
transcendent theories which have done so much 
to confuse the conceptions involved. In brief, the 
study of the abnormal distinctly reinforces the 
naturalistic conceptions of personality that result 
from a psychological study of the growth of this 
precious sense. 

Sweden is the healthiest coun- 
try in Europe; it boasts a 
death-rate of only sixteen and 
a half per thousand, and a correspondingly high 
average term of life. In their evolution from the 
Suiones, these people have been but little affected 
by extraneous influences; they have received no 
impress from Roman culture, Roman law, or the 
feudal system that ruled mediaeval society. 
Christianity came to them through the Normans 
of France; the Roman church exercised a nom- 
inal sway in the country for two centuries, but it 
was never very effective. In that period, how- 
■ever, the country produced a great personage in 
Saint Brigitta (Bridget), who was influential in 
bringing about the return of the Popes from 
Avignon to Rome in the fourteenth century. A 
far greater national hero was Gustavus Adolphus, 
whose defense of Protestant principles brought 
Sweden prominently into the field of European 
polities in the sixteenth century, a prominence 
which ended with the loss of Finland, after that 
of Pomerania and the Baltic Provinces, early in 
the nineteenth century. The country has shared 
its king (since 1814) with Norway, though each 
country' has its own constitution. In Sweden the 
<?ost of education is defrayed by the state or 
parish, is absolutely free to the recipient, is 
thorough, and is so prolonged that men usually 
postpone their marriage until they are thirty 
years of age. It is the original home of what is 
tnown in this country as 'sloyd,' — a system of 
industrial education which makes deft fingers 
and 'develops mechanical practice and general 
handiness.' These characteristics and many 
more that might be mentioned, give interest to 
Mr. 0. G. Yon Heidenstam's voliune on 'Swedish 
Life in Town and Country,' in the series describ- 
ing 'Our European Neighbors' (Putnam). The 
■chapters on the literature, arts, and economics of 
the country are highly entertaining; but of sur- 
passing interest are the few paragraphs which 
inform us of Sweden's successful solution of the 
•drink problem with which other countries have 
:grappled in vain. 



A Frenchtooman's Madame Adam is best known 
narrative of her for her journal of the Paris 
literary life. g^g^g^ j^g^ 'Nouvelle Revue' 
which she founded and for many years edited, 
and her salon which, with her Review, exerted a 
recognized political influence. Her account of 
her earlier life has already been noticed in these 
columns. With short intermission, now follows 
its sequel in 'My Literary Life' (Appleton), 
which brings the record down to the later sixties 
—or at least this is to be inferred; for hardly a 
date appears in the whole book, whose chief 
defect (or excellence) is its haj>-hazard garrulity, 
extending to the length of 542 pages. Such an 
outpouring necessarily contains, for the foreign 
reader at any rate, much that is lacking in inter- 
est. The reproduction of long conversations 
between i>ersons of far less than world-wide fame 
on themes of not exactly universal concern is a 
prominent feature of the book. Is it from short- 
hand notes, or from memorj- aided by imagina- 
tion, that these pages of talk are taken? What 
appears to be an absurd mistranslation enlivens 
one of them. A certain Dr. Maure, an epicure, 
relates of Cousin, with great contempt, 'Would 
you believe me, that one day arriving in the mid- 
dle of luncheon I heard him asking his governess 
for some veal, and it was pheasant ! ! ' That 
gouvemante may mean housekeeper as well as 
governess seems not to have impressed itself on 
the anonymous translator. Reminiscences of 
George Sand, About, Berlioz, Wagner, Liszt, 
Flaubert, Merimee, Ste. Beuve, and other celebri- 
ties, give the book its value, apart from our 
interest in the very communicative lady who 
writes it. The narrative closes, as shall this 
notice, with Mme. d'Agoult's recipe for founding 
a salon. 'You need,' she writes to the author, 
'twenty men friends and five women to found a 
salon. You have them. Mine wOl remain the big 
winter salon, yours will be the little summer 
salon, and thus our intimate set will never be 
quite dispersed. ' 



The land 
of mirages 



A study of the American des- 
erts that has quite as much 
atmosphere as Mrs. Austin's 
'Land of Little Rain,' and that seems to get even 
closer to the strange heart of the matter, is the 
little volume of sketches entitled 'In Miners' 
]Mirage-Land, ' by Mrs. Idah Meacham Strobridge. 
The book is published by the author from her 
own bindery in Los Angeles, in an autograph 
edition limited to one thousand copies. The cover- 
design and chapter-headings are the work of Mr. 
J. Duncan Gleason, and a reproduction of Mr. 
Frank P. Sauerwen's painting called 'Mirage in 
the Desert' makes an appropriate frontispiece. 
'Mirage of Water or Mirage of a Mine! It mat- 
ters not which it may be, the end is the same for 
him who follows after the Siren who is always 
in league with Death.' This quotation will ser\-e 
to show how Mrs. Strobridge interprets her title. 
Some of the tales are of literal mirages,— a shin- 
ing lake, an exquisitely-colored palace, a red- 
shirted man driving his wagon down a dusty 
road ; other sketches have to do with the no less

fabulous and fateful mirages of the mind, the 
dreams of treasure hidden in the desert which 
ever evades the prospector while luring him on to 
give his life in the search. The stories have a 
strength and directness of style that make them 
very real, and the little introductory studies pre- 
facing the tales help to suggest the charm and 
mystery of the strange regions dealt with. 

'Women in the Fine Arts' 
(Houghton, Mifflin & Co.), by 
Mrs. Clara Erskine Clement, is 
a compendium of miscellaneous information about 
all the women artists that the author could dis- 
cover between the seventh century B. C. and the 
twentieth A. D. Among the thousand names 
included, the late nineteenth century is most fully 
represented. As the greater part of the material 
about contemporary painters was furnished by 
themselves, we may assume that it is correct ; and 
as Mrs. Clement's aim was to include all the 
names and all the facts she could get, we cannot 
criticise her selection or proportion. Being alpha- 
betically arranged, the book is a convenient man- 
ual from which to extract information about 
artists who have not yet got into the encyclopae- 
dias. A number of full-page illustrations add 
interest to the text, and a fifty-page introduction 
gives a general idea of what women have accom- 
plished in art. 



Vagaries in 
language and 
thought. 



Anyone who desires an addi- 
tional illustration of the readi- 
ness Avith which the inexpert 
abuse the methods and materials belonging to 
recognized fields of science may find it in Mr. 
Emil Sutro's 'Duality of Thought and Language' 
(New York: Physio-Psychic Society). The 
author professes to have made the remark- 
able discovery that there are two voices in man, 
the one of the larynx and the other of the oesoph- 
agus; and that these two possess unique rela- 
tions to the 'soul' element of speech. Tortuous 
and commonplace repetitions and variations of 
this theme make up the volume; which, indeed, 
has no claim to consideration except as an exam- 
ple of the confusion which may be the fruit of 
interest and enthusiasm unfortified by apprecia- 
tion of what scientific investigation is or what 
it has accomplished. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



'Lectures and Biographical Sketches,' 'Miscel- 
lanies,' and 'Natural History of Intellect and 
Other Papers, ' are the titles of three volumes added 
to the 'Centenary' edition of Emerson, published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. These three vol- 
umes complete the twelve of which the set con- 
sists, and the last of them is provided with an 
elaborate general index to the entire edition. No 
less than five papers in this closing volume are 
now printed for the first time. The editing of 
these volumes, done by the pious hands of Mr. 
Edward Waldo Emerson, ofiPers a shining example 
of what such editorial work should be, and makes 
the present form of the writings far more desirable 
than any of the earlier ones. 



Professor Barrett Wendell 's ' Literary History of 
America' has been condensed by its author, with 
the help of Mr. Chester Noyes Greenough, into *A 
History of Literature in America, ' for the use of 
schools. Superfluous and questionable matters ar& 
omitted from this version, which otherwise pre- 
serves the outline, and much of the text, of the 
original production. The book is published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Volume II. of the 'Publications of the Yerkes 
Observatory of the University of Chicago' is a 
handsome quarto with many plates. It includes a 
paper on double stars by Professor Burnham, one 
on Eros by Professor Barnard, two papers on 
stellar spectra, and three others. There are some 
highly satisfactory photographs made with the great 
40-inch refractor of the Observatory. This volume 
is also issued as No. VII. in the series of the 
Decennial Publications of the University. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. publish a hand- 
some library edition of Thackeray in thirty vol- 
umes. The editorial matter is supplied by Pro- 
fessors W. P. Trent and J. B. Henneman, ^nd 
includes a special introduction to each of the 
works, besides a biographical essay prefatory ta 
the entire edition. There are numerous illustra- 
tions, and altogether the edition is highly satisfac- 
tory, both for completeness and inexpensiveness. 

'Ethics for the Young,' third and fourth series,, 
are sent us by the W. M. Welch Co., Chicago. These 
books are written by Mr. Walter L. Sheldon, lec- 
turer of the St. Louis Ethical Society, and have 
for their respective subjects 'Duties in the Home^ 
and the Family ' and ' Citizenship and the Duties 
of a Citizen.' These are teaching books of a help- 
ful kind, written in dialogue, and provided with 
outlines, exercises, and illustrative quotations. 

'Avril' is the appropriate title of a group of 
essays, by Mr. Hilaire Belloe, upon the poetry of 
the French Renaissance. The subjects of the essays 
are these six: Charles of Orleans, Villon, Marot, 
R'onsard, Du Bellay, and Malherbe. Each is given 
an introductory critical discussion, and each is then 
illustrated by a number of poems, printed in French 
and commented upon in English. This beautifully 
printed, written, and illustrated book is published 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., and is a treasure 
in every sense. 

'The Teaching of Biology in the Secondary 
School, ' by Professors Francis E. Lloyd and Maurice 
A. Bigelow, is a new volume in the 'American 
Teachers' Series,' published by Messrs. Longmans,. 
Green, & Co. It is a work fully up to the high 
standard set by its predecessors in this series, and 
no teacher of the subject in an American high 
school can afford to be without it. We commend 
particularly the sensible pages devoted to the sub- 
ject of 'temperance' instruction in connection with 
the study of physiology. 

'The Poems of William Morris,' selected and' 
edited by Mr. Percy Robert Colwell, is a hand- 
some volume published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & 
Co. The selection is a generous one, although in 
the nature of the case a single volume can give 
hardly more than a taste of 'Jason,' 'Sigurd,' and 
'The Earthly Paradise.' There is an introductory 
essay, a limited bibliography, and a few notes. The 
same publishers have issued, in style uniform with 
the above book, an anthology of ' The Greek 
Poets,' edited by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole. The 
range of the selection is from Homer to Meleager, 
and the translations represent a greater number of 
hands than the authors themselves. They are 
taken from writers old-fashioned and modern, and . 
the editor contributes a number of his own.

Trollope's 'The Bertrams,' edited by Mr. Algar

A. McMurry. It is the first part of an elementary 
physical geography of this country, prepared for 
school use.

of government and the development of political 
institutions in the United States.' It is published

'Light on the Hills,' edited by Dr. Charles Car- 
roll Albert son, is a devotional anthology published 
by the J. B. Lippincott Co. The selection of poems 
is not altogether discriminating, but the book con- 
tains much that is of enduring spiritual value. 

'The Government of Ohio: Its History and 
Administration,' by Professor Wilbur H. Siebert, 
is published by the Macmillan Co. in their 'Hand- 
books of American Government,' a series in which 
several other states have previously been included- 

'A School History of the Fnited States,' by 
Professor WiUiam H. Mace, is published by Messrs. 
Rand, McNally & Co. It is an elementary text- 
book, handsomely illustrated, and provided with 
helpful teaching and reference apparatus in great 
variety. 

'The Nibelungenlied, ' translated into rhymed 
English verse in the metre of the original, comes 
to us from Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The transla-

accompanied by a lengthy essay upon the poem 
and it-s sources. 



'Parsifal and Galahad,' by Miss Helen Isabel 
Whitow, is a pamphlet recently published by Mr. 
Thomas Whittaker. It is an essay upon the sources 
of the Parsifal legend as well as an analysis 
of the use which Wagner made of it in his musie- 
drama. 

'Classical Echoes in Tennyson,' by Prof. Wilfred 
P. Mustard, is a new volume of the 'Columbia 
University Studies in English. ' The work has been 
done before, but not, we believe, as thoroughly and 
minutely by any one person. The Macmillan Co. 
publish this volume. 

Miss Ella Isabel Harris has translated the trag- 
edies of Seneca into English veirse, and . thereby 
placed students of modem literature who know 
not Latin under a considerable obligation. The 
volume is published by Mr. Henry IVowde at the 
Oxford University Press. 

Mr. Andrew J. George has edited 'The Complete 
Poetical Works of William Wordsworth' for the 
'Cambridge Editions' of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin

bibliography, fills nearly a thousand two-columned 
pages, and has a fine frontispiece portrait. 

Dr. William Anthony Granville's 'Elements of 
the Differential and Integral Calculus,' published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co., is described as 'essentially 
a drill book.' It constitutes the first volume in 
a new series of mathematical text-books under the 
general editorship of Professor Percy F. Smith. 

Mr. H. W. Mabie's "William Shakespeare, Poet, 
Dramatist, and Man' is reissued by the Macmillan 
Co. in a new edition, with a new preface, and at 
a low price. The illustrations of the earlier edi- 
tion are missing, which is, of course, the reason why 
the work is now offered in so inexpensive a form. 

Herr FeUx Weingartner 's essay on 'The Sym- 
phony since Beethoven,' translated with the 
author's permission by 3Jj8s Maude Barrows Dut- 
ton, is published as a booklet by the Oliver Ditson 
Co. It is one of the most valuable pieces of musi- 
cal criticism produced of recent years, and deserves 
a very wide circulation. 

Professor Jebb's masterly prose translation of 
'The Tragedies of Sophocles' may now be had in 
a single volume unencumbered by Greek text or 
' commentary, and thus brought within the reach of 
modest purses. This translation, so much more 
desirable than any other, is published by the 
Macmillan Co. for the Cambridge University Press. 

'Murray's Small Classical Atlas,' edited by Mr. 
G. B. Grundy, and published by Mr. Henry Frowde 
at the Oxford University Press, is accurately de- 
scribed in the preface as a 'good and at the same 
time inexpensive' work. Colored contours and 
legible type make the maps exceptionally clear. 
They are fourteen in number, preceded by an elab- 
orate index. 

The German text of 'Parsifal,' facing an English 
translation made to fit the score by Mr. George 
Turner Phelps, is published in a small volume by 
Mr. Kichard G. Badger. It well illustrates the 
utter hopelessness of attempting to sing the work 
with English words and at the same time preserve 
more than a small fraction of its poetical impres- 
siveness. Mr. Turner has struggled manfully with 
an impossible task. 

The editorial supervision of Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 's series of limited Riverside Press

NEW GRAND CANYON HOTEL, EL TOVAR. 

Nearly everything worth while in the Southwest 
dates back to Francisco Vasquez Coronado, the Spanish 
governor of Galacia, who left Mexico in the year 1540, 
accompanied by several hundred warriors, in search of 
the mythical seven cities of Cibola. 

Coronado and his men found no gold, but they 
discovered New Mexico, Arizona, and other sections of 
the Rockies. Their most spectacular " find " was the 
Grand Canyon of Arizona. 

Chief among Coronado's lieutenants was a brave 
conquistador named Pedro del Tovar, captain of the 
detachment that explored and conquered the province 
of Tusayan, now known as Mokiland. While among 
the Mokis, Tovar heard of the Grand Canyon, which 
borders old Tusayan on the west. He reported the tale 
to Coronado, and Cardenas was sent out to verify it. 

Though not the first white man to see this titan of 
chasms, Tover was largely instrumental in its discov- 
ery, so when the Santa Fe needed an appropriate name 
for the new hotel at Bright Angel, " El Tovar " was 
selected. It is true that Don Pedro, etc., waited nearly 
four centuries for immortality, but better men have 
waited a thousand years — and still remain unknown to 
fame. 

It is a far cry from 1540 to 1905. Early in Jan- 
uary will be opened the most unique, the most com- 
fortable, the most costly hotel in the Southwest, under 
management of Mr. Fred Harvey, whose reputation as 
a caterer is national. 

Occupying a site 7000 feet above sea-level, close to 
the rim of the grandest of canyons, at the railway ter- 
minus and not far from the head of Bright Angel trail, 
El Tovar commands a prospect without parallel in the 
world — a perpendicular mile from rim to river (seven 
miles by trail) and thirteen dizzy miles across to the 
opposite Canyon wall. The roaring Colorado below 
looks like a silvery thread and its tumult seldom 
reaches the stillness of the upper air. On three sides 
are the fragrant pines of Coconino, a Government 
forest reserve, and the largest continuous belt of pine 
timber in the United States. Everywhere a riot of 
color and beauty of form, a vision unspeakable. 

EI Tovar is a long, low, rambling edifice, built of 
native boulders and pine logs. Expressed with exact- 
ness, the width north and south is 325 feet and from 
east to west 200 feet. 

El Tovar is to cost more than a quarter of a million 
dollars. No money has been spared to get the most 
up-to-date equipment possible. Take the item of fur- 
niture: it is all from special arts and crafts designs, 
combining use and beauty. 

Among the minor comforts may be mentioned a 
telephone in each room with direct office connection. 
There is not a room in the house where the son fails to 
enter at some period of the day. 

The protection against fire is very complete, the 
reserve supply of water in the steel tank being 125,000 
gallons. The plant furnishing heat, light, power and 
water is far enough removed to be unobjectionable. 

There are stables and corrals where horses and 
teams are kept for trips along the rim and down to 
the river. A searchlight has been ordered, to light ap 
the wierd canyon depths at night. 

Adjacent is a Hopi bouse, built of stones and adobe, 
exactly reproducing one of the unique dwellings of the 
Hopi Indians. In this picturesque structure will live 



several families of Hopi weavers and potters, plying 
their strange handicrafts. A museum of rare Indian 
curios will be installed and photos sold. 

Mr. Harvey has selected Air. Chas. A. Brant as local 
manager, a gentleman favorably known in hotel and 
club circles. 

The opening of El Tovar on January 10, 1905, will 
add another strong reason to the many already existing 
why the Grand Canyon of A^zona should be visited 
on the way to California over the Santa Fe. The 
canyon itself needs no endorsement. It is the greatest 
scenic wonder of the world.

Tenth Season of the California Limited. 

Ten years ago this fall the Santa Fe started its 
California Limited train on the initial run across the 
continent. Many improvements have been made in that 
busy decade. To-day's engines and coaches are much 
heavier than those of 1894. Millions of dollars have 
been spent on the track alone — some of it for oil- 
sprinkled (dustless) roadbed and oil-burning (smoke- 
less) engines. The time is faster, too. 

Daily service of the California Limited was resumed 
Sunday, November 13, for the tenth season. This is 
now an all-the-year- 'round train, between Chicago, Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, running through the South- 
west land of enchantment. The time, Chicago to Los 
Angeles, is about 68 hours, which is fast speed for 
the 2265 miles traversed, considering that several

THEODORE THOMAS. 

The great musician whose beneficent life was 
ended on the fourth of this month was a Ger- 
man by birth, but became one of the foremost 
of Americans, and as such our bereaved nation 
does honor to his memory, and pays its heart- 
felt tribute of gratitude for his half-century 
of activity in furthering the highest interests 
of American culture. The part taken by music 
in the impressive services of his burial, two days 
later, had a closer fitness than that of merely 
emphasizing the particular nature of his life 
work ; it acquired a peculiar special significance 
from the relation of the selections performed 
to the ideals to which Theodore Thomas had 
given unswerving allegiance through all his 
years, and to the essential memory of the art 
which it has been his mission to interpret for 
the sweetening of human existence and the 
ennobling of human character. It has some- 
times been ingeniously argued that music is a 
form of entertainment, a titillation of the sense 
without any bearing upon the conduct or the 
purpose of life. If ever a claim seemed hollow, 
it was during the hours consecrated to this 
mans memory, when music was invoked to 
express the thoughts and feelings, far beyond 
the power of words to reach, of the mourning 
multitude. 

At the church services, the mighty spirits 
of Bach and Beethoven took possession of the 
sacred edifice. An organ prelude, followed by 
the rugged measures of Luther's hymn, gave to 
the hour its religious key. Then the wind choir 
of the orchestra intoned the divine choral 
melody of the Xinth Symphony with its mes- 
sage of human brotherhood, so deeply felt by 
all those present, as they recalled the inspira- 
tion that it had been to them in time past, and 
associated that inspiration with their sense of 
gratitude toward the dead leader. Finally, the 
note of personal grief came from the organ 
with those strains from the close of the Passion 
according to St. Matthew which are the supreme 
expression at once of tenderness, pathos, and 
sublimity. A few hours later, when the remains 
had been laid to rest, a great company gathered 
in the Orchestra Hall, and listened silently, 
with bowed heads, to the following programme 
of memorial music : 

Chorale Bach 

Symphony No. 3, ' Eroica ' BeetJuwen 

Allegro con brio 

Marcia funebre 
Siegfried's Death March, 'Die Gotterdam- 

merung' Wagner 

Tone Poem, 'Tod und Verklarung' Strauss 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



Here again, in exquisite and harmonious 
sequence, were stirred the emotions fitting the 
occasion. First came the note of religious resig- 
nation, then the note of chastened joy that is 
never far removed from tears, followed by that 
of mourning, unrelieved and black. Then came 
the same solemn note of mourning, but this 
time relieved by tender and heroic memories, 
and then, last of all, came the note of hopeful- 
ness, of Verhliirung, of buoyant life reasserting 
its claim, of heart renewed for the future. It 
was a perfect hour, perfectly embodied in the 
divine symbolism of the deepest of the arts. 

It is not easy to adjust our minds to the fact 
that Theod'ore Thomas is dead. Those who, 
like the present writer, have heard something 
like five hundred concerts given under his lead- 
ership during the past thirty years, who owe to 
him practically their whole acquaintance with 
orchestral music, must be simply dazed by their 
loss. To such, he has stood for all these years 
as the beginning and the end of miLsic. almost 
as their sole means of access to its fountain of 
inspiration. The contrast ,l3etween those who 
have had the inestimable opportunity of long 
continued contact with his work and those who 
have not is like the contrast between persons 
who have all their lives had the use of a com- 
prehensive collection of English poetrv* and the 
persons who have had within reach only some 
'Library of Poetry and Song' or 'Golden 
Treasury ' of excerpts. It is only by thus trans- 
ferring the case to its literary parallel that it is 
possible to realize what such a loss means, or to 
imagine how much poorer life would have been 
without his labors for its enrichment. There 
are in this country — there are in Chicago 
alone — many thousands of men and women 
who have enjoyed a liberal education in music 
through his agency, and who could not without 
that agency have had anything but a casual and 
fragmentary acquaintance with the art which 
for the past two centuries — from Bach to 
Brahms — has contributed at least as largely 
as any other art to the upbuilding of the spiri- 
tual life. 

Mr. Thomas was in his seventieth year when 
ke died, and sixty of his years were spent in the 
country of his adoption. It is easily within 
bounds to say that no other musician during 
those years has done so much as he for the 
development of musical taste in the United 
States. And the secret of his achievement — if 
we may call it a secret — is found in his stead- 
fast devotion to the highest ideals of his art. 
His rugged and uncompromising temper, in all 
questions directly concerning his art. often 
made him enemies, but of a kind for which his 
followers loved him all the more. It is barely 
ten years since, in the city which he had honored 
by choosing for his permanent home, that he 



was made the victim of a vicious and virulent 
attack, accompanied by every imaginable form 
of mean and malicious insinuation, solely 
because he refused to lower his standards for the 
sake of a cheap popularity, or to prostitute his 
art to commercial considerations. And even 
after the fury of that outburst was past, and 
those responsible for it had been revealed in 
all their contemptible insignificance, there were 
still raised against him from time to time the 
voices of those who should have been better 
advised, urging that he make concessions to the 
ignorant humor of the public, and give them the. 
music for which they clamored instead of the 
music which he knew that they ought to hear. 

To all these appeals Mr. Thomas turned a 
deaf ear, and continued in his imperturbable 
'course. And if we accord him all honor for 
this attitude, we must permit the honor to be 
shared with the men upon whose invitation he 
had come to Chicago in 1891, and who gave 
liim unfailing support to the end. It was a 
loyal body of public-spirited citizens — fifty at 
first, the number afterwards dwindling to much 
less than that — who made with him in the 
beginning the solemn compact that only artistic 
considerations should prevail in the manage- 
ment of the enterprise, that the question of box- 
office receipts should never be allowed to modify 
a standard of excellence which art alone should 
dictate. How well that promise Avas kept, and 
at how gi*eat a personal sacrifice on the part of 
those who kept it, is a matter of history. 

Some further historical recapitulation 
becomes appropriate at this point. After meet- 
ing large annual deficits, amounting in the 
aggregate to about half a million dollars, for 
twelve years, the men who had been keeping the 
orchestra in existence felt that the time had 
come to call upon the larger public to share the 
burden. Accordingly, in 1903, they declared 
their belief that an endowment fund of three- 
quarters of a million must be raised, and a per- 
manent home provided for the orchestra. Thus, 
and thus only, would • its lasting continuance 
he insured. They announced that they were 
prepared for one more year to meet the losses 
of the orchestra, which must then come to an 
end unless the public was willing to give prac- 
tical expression of a wish for its preservation. 
A popular subscription was then inaugurated, 
which in the course of the year following pro- 
duced from upwards of eight thousand sub- 
scribers nearly the required sum. In May of 
the present year, ground was broken for the new 
building, during the summer and fall the work 
of construction went on, and its doors were 
opened on December 14 for the dedicatory con- 
cert under the leadership of Mr. Thomas. Two 
concerts in the regular series followed, and 
then, on Christmas eve, the veteran conductor

laid down his baton forever. He had lived to 
see realized his fondest dream; he died knowing 
that his work would live after him, not merely 
in memory, but in actual prosecution upon the 
foundation for which he so long had labored. 

This knowledge must have been an unspeak- 
able consolation to him in his dying hour, and 
it offers a kind of consolation to those of us 
who are left to mourn his loss. Had his life 
been lessened by even a single year, it is not 
likely that the subscription would have been 
carried on or the building erected. In that case, 
the body of musicians to whom he had been 
giving such masterly training for the twelve 
years past would in all probability have been 
dispersed, and one of the two or three chief 
agencies of musical education in this country 
would have come to an end. As matters now 
stand, we have the building, the grand concert 
organ included, we have the orchestra, and it is 
generally understood that by the terms of the 
conductor's will, his collection of scores, valued 
at more than a quarter of a million, will also 
become the property of the Orchestral Associa- 
tion as trustee for the public. In these facts 
there is much cause for thankfulness, whatever 
the sense of personal loss, while mingled with 
this thankfulness is our grateful recollection of 
the leader through whose ministrations we so 
often have heard, in the beautiftd words of Mr. 
Charles Eussell, 

' As from a Sinai speak the souls of seers 
Such mighty messages that whoso hears. 
With burning eyes aloft and bosom heaving. 
For that pure joy unmixed with mortal grieving. 
Feels close about his heart the touch of tears.' 



COMM UNIC A TION. 

THE FATE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IN 

SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

For eleven years I have had to confront the 
ghosts of the entrance requirement texts that are 
still perched on the threshold of enterprise and 
success in the right teaching of Enelish litera- 
ture. They are as much substance as ghost, 
secretly terrifying teachers whose mouths are 
gagged by a discretion that enables them to keep 
their pyositions. Superintendents and principals 
ignorantly or helplessly crook the hinges of their 
knees exactly as they did ten years ago to the 
demands of that examination which must be 
passed at the gates of the universities. High 
school walls, on which are the glowing, dragon- 
like shapes of mechanical drudgery devices and 
pedantic details required by the teaching of the 
over-edited texts, move toward enervated teach- 
ers and pupils. Will friendly arms be reached 
out to save, as was the case when at the last 
moment Poe's unfortunate escaped the Pit? 

A prominent bookman, when questioned by 
me in regard to what he thought of the texts, 



replied, 'My business is to sell all the English 
texts required by the colleges, but the reason why 
I know so little about what you ask is that I 
entered college by means of them, and to this day 
I have never had any taste for English, for 
mechanical outlines, Jack pudding farce essays, 
and plagiarized critical comment.' 

Another friend of mine, a teacher, had to fight 
for three years over the feasibility of publishing 
connected poetic masterpieces with a background 
of the various historical periods in the develop- 
ment of English literature. A principal of one of 
the finest high schools in the country, after 
examining his book in manuscript, said to him, 
* You are ten years ahead of your time. You will 
never get that book published with the entire 
educational system against you; the committee 
down East will not brook it for a minute. No 
publisher will touch it. I thoroughly believe in 
your book and wish I could use it in my school,' 
In order to ascertain the need for such a book 
with the general school public, the author sent 
out over a hundred circular letters to the teach- 
ers of English in large and small high schools. 
He received fifty answers, forty of which were 
in favor of anthology work; but of these forty 
teachers very few were doing anything of the 
kind, simply because, as they said, *The course 
as mapped out at present does not permit.' To 
his astonishment, ten of these forty teachers 
refused to sign their names to the letters; they 
were afraid to go on record as heretics or apK)S- 
tates. Many wrote long letters to show how 
exceedingly dissatisfied they were with a lack of 
system in teaching the requirement texts, stating 
that these were unconnected and would be gladly 
eschewed if 'the powers that be' would take their 
fingers off the schools. 

These letters from all parts of the country 
showed that the pulse of American secondary 
school education is not in the wrist of college 
authority; and by them my friend convinced men 
of the vital method of such a book, and that a 
reaction had set in against texts, which manacle 
the minds of both teacher and pupil to a detailed 
mastery of a few isolated masterpieces and their 
historical pyeriods in the development of English 
literature. 

Last year I visited a fine high school, and while 
in the preparatory English recitation heard the 
teacher say, 'Remember, girls and boys, that the 
learning of English is nowadays as difficult as 
your Greek and Latin, and now have I not always 
placed emphasis on the time element? English 
demands exactly as much as you spend on your 
Latin.' I made careful inquiry concerning this 
teacher, and found out that she required so many 
themes that those which did not fill her waste 
paper basket were pardoned the padding from 
encyclopaedias because she felt sure that Greek 
or Latin time had been spent in their prepara- 
tion. On the black-board I noticed a list of 
questions on ' The Vicar of Wakefield ' as formid- 
able as 'What is this?' 'What is this?' found 
every week in the College English column of * The 
Journal of Education,' and outlines reminding 
one of the Cretan labyrinth. The text they were 
reading had no connection with its predecessor.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



But was the teacher to be blamed in this respect? 
Are not all the texts disconnected,— is there any 
unity of development ? There was but one end to 
all her work,— the great gate down College lane 
toward which her literary bankrupts were 
scrambling. 

Another phase of the tragedy seemed to me to 
be that almost all of the third and fourth year 
pupils were in her classes. In the third year 
there were forty pupils, all intending to go to 
college. I thought of the thirty who would never 
go, and blushed for their knowledge of English 
literature. Not so much did I worry as to what 
the world would think of their knowledge but as 
to what they themselves would afterwards suffer, 
when they would realize how they had been 
duped into thinking college entrance require- 
ments a fine knowledge of the great, developing 
body of English literature. 

I inspected the work of the teachers of English 
who were giving the General Course, and here I 
found literature. English poetry and prose were 
systematically taught. There was little forced 
work. It was good to breathe in the air of taste 
and appreciation; and I thought. Now if I were 
in a college which set of pupils would I desire 
to come to me? I would wish interest, spon- 
taneity, and some definite critical and apprecia^- 
tive power. 

At recess I wandered into the school library, 
where a Senior girl sat in front of several 
opened volumes. I asked her what she was doing. 
*0h! I am padding an essay on ''Macbeth".' 
^Are you taking material from books,' I asked. 
'No, not so much that, as I am practising 
phrasal and sentence extension. My theme must 
fill six pages and I've got to fill out.' 'Dear 
me!' I said, 'do you enjoy your work in that 
course?' 'No,' she replied, 'but maybe I'll go to 
college some day, and then I've asked the prin- 
cipal if I could go into the English literature of 
the General Course, but he won't let me; then it 
is the crack course, our preparatory course. 
English is the only study I don 't like in it, but I 
want what all the pupils get from the course — 
favors and recognition from those who run the 
school. ' 

When I left that building I felt full of gaiety, 
but lalso felt horror treading on my heels as the 
question came: Is the High School fated to be 
a feeder for a college? If so, I could endure it 
in all but the giving up of my English literature. 

The high school that I visited was doing fine 
work in everything except the English require- 
ments. The teacher of English knew her subject 
but she taught under the incubus of the texts; 
she was simply magnetized by the distant college 
walls. All of her pupils were going to college, 
and whatever they lost in high school they would 
gain there. 

I went to another high school and the situation 
was not much better. Through the occult power 
of the colleges the General Course had been rele- 
gated to the rear, so that only two courses were 
paramount, — the Preparatory and the Commer- 
cial. Everybody desired to make an effort to 
study for the university. The brightest pupils 
from the lower grades had been recommended to 



the Preparatory Course, and those ranking next 
had been urged to it by their parents and teach- 
ers. Its course was considered the finest, and 
therefore it received brains and numbers. Is 
there any school where favors do not go to the 
brightest and most assertive? But does English 
literature rightly taught go to them ? No ; and at 
the present writing the delicate problem is yet to 
be solved. 

In the larger secondary schools, pupils who do 
not go away to college receive a much better 
course in English literature than those who da 
go. They receive a systematic course in Ameri- 
can and English literature with the historical 
background. The entrance requirement texts of 
high intrinsic worth are used when they naturally 
come up in the historical development of litera- 
ture. No attempt is made to make the great 
body of English poetry and prose dance about 
disjecta membra of itself, for such indeed is 
the dance of death for literature in secondary 
schools. 

If the teachers of English literature could 
avoid the requirement - text-system, they could 
divide the school body during the last two years 
and give to all the broad, liberal, historically 
developing literature which fits not only for col- 
lege but also for after life. Then the pupils 
would be safe, and the entrance requirement 
texts would not mar those unfortunate girls and 
boys who, after leaving the high school, cannot 
go to college. All would be satisfied with this 
equalization of the two courses, the General and 
the Preparatory, since in the study of English 
literature the high school would be the people's 
college and the university's college. 

A summary of the situation in the high schools 
is as follows: 

(1) The colleges do not hurt the English 
composition and rhetoric work of any course in 
the first year. 

(2) The colleges do hamper the work in 
English literature of the third and fourth years 
of the Preparatory Course by requiring the 
abominable text-system. 

(3) The colleges cause the requirement texts 
to be regarded as more meritable than any- 
thing offered in any other course in English 
literature. Therefore, the systematic study of 
American and English literature in the second, 
third, and fourth years of the General Course^ 
in which are the English, Geiman, and Latin- 
Scientific divisions, is presented to the minority 
of the school body. 

The college is especially detrimental to English 
literature in secondary schools by reason of its 
academy where the study does not exist. When 
high school graduates come up for the entrance 
examination, they are not passed on literature but 
on the amount of theme work and the required 
texts. Hence the disappearance of English liter- 
ature in the adjacent high schools. 

Not long ago a principal of a high school said 
to me, 'I hate to see English literature go, but 
the presence of our city college demands it. In 
its academy there is no literature, and why 
should I have it? As a defensive policy for 
increasing our numbers and holding our own with

ST 



that academy, I have made our Preparatory 
Course identical with its Preparatory Course. 
Now since the high school offers the same course 
as that given by the academy of the college, and 
since it does not cost anything to send children 
to the high school, the city parents will patronize 
a free school, the graduates of which are always 
prepared to enter not only our college but any 
other college in the land. Of course the ques- 
tions naturally arise: Should citizens be taxed 
to suppKjrt an academy? Why should not the 
citizens receive remuneration as the college 
receives it from the pupils who are preparing 
for their college course?' 

As I have already suggested, the salvation and 
solution of the English problem lie in giving the 
Preparatory pupils the same English literature 
that is given to the pupils of the Greneral Course, 
and in asking the colleges to prescribe or pro- 
scribe teachers, letting the texts take care of 
themselves. There can be and should be uni- 
formity in these two requirements. 

The University Departments of English are 
keenly feeling the presence of weaklings who 
have entered their courses by means of the 
thimib screws. The universities are tired of their 
own ad nauseum entrance method and are suffer- 
ing the nemesis of forced, unnatural work so 
much that they are now seeking to be motive 
powers to form a backwater, which 'in. gurgit* 
vasto' will go up the stream to smooth the ruf- 
fled waters and right the current. 

A child may read the signs of reformation, but 
who is mature enough to set the high water- mark 
by supplying *a general substitution of vital 
methods, which are diflScult, for mechanical 
methods, which are easy, in the work of our 
teachers of English literature, high and low?' 

I wish every secondary school teacher of Eng- 
lish in the country would read the editorial in 
The Dial of November 16 last, and Mr. Abra- 
ham Flexner's article on 'The Preparatory 
School' (especially p. 372), in the September 
number of 'The Atlantic Monthly.' And their 
cry rises tingling to the stars. Ena-lish litera- 
ture in the schools shall not be termed the texts 
prescribed by- the colleges. 

The passing of English literature in the schools 
has been taking place for the last ten years; but 
from America's educational Aval on an Arthur 
is coming, and thrice as fair, to separate the t^xts 
from colleges which have never made their teach- 
ers satellites to a few disconnected masterpieces. 
'Man is freest, when freest bound,' when in the 
imiversity he gives fruit instead of thistles and 
methods; and when such comes from the colleges 
to the secondary schools, we will receive him, 
reverencing him as our conscience, saying, 'Let 
the King reign!' I cannot tell what he will 
bring, but as the humblest of his forertmners I 
think it will be largely '^■ital methods, which are 
diflBcult,' modeled after those which are now 
foimd in the very few best text-books on English 
literature for secondarv schools published during 
1903-1904 by the book houses.

A Veterax Pubusher's Eetrospect.* 

How richly stored with pleasant memories of 
authors a publisher's mind may become after 
years of work at his calling, was shown to the 
delight of his many readers by the late James 
T. Fields. But there are publishers and pub- 
lishers, and the charm of Mr. Fields's reminis- 
cences was due quite as much to the story-tell- 
er as to the eminent persons a<bout whom he 
wrote. Other publishers have written reminis- 
cently since Mr. Fields's book appeared, but few 
have approached in attractiveness of manner 
and interest of matter the still popular ' Yes- 
terdays with Authors. ' And now the retiring 
head of another old and honored publishing 
house brings forth his store of anecdotes and 
impressions of the famous men and women with 
whom a half-century of business dealings 
brought him in contact, and with many of 
whom he stood on terms of cordial friendship. 
These octogenarian reminiscences are from the 
pen of Mr. Edward Marston, whose name at 
once calls up those of his sometime associates, 
Sampson Low and son, Searle, and Eivington; 
and with the names come back faint or vivid 
remembrances of books that bore their imprint, 
— good old three-volume novels by Willde Col- 
lins, Blackmore, Black, Eeade, George Mac- 
donald, Clark Russell, and others, and many 
excellent books of travel by such famous ex- 
plorers as Stanley, Mounteney-Jephson, Parke, 
MacGahan, Schweinfurth, Xares, Markham, 
Bumaby, and Butler, The pleasant pages of 
Mr. Marston's book are not especially distin- 
guished for elegance of style or charm of man- 
ner, or even for very great attention to order- 
liness of arrangement and accuracy of detail. 
But as they give in rapid succession glimpses 
of live men and women whom one is always 
glad to meet, the book is excellent company 
for a winters evening. ^Ir. Marston is already 
known to the reading public, which has 
received with considerable favor a dozen vol- 
umes from his pen, dealing chiefly with fish- 
ing, travel, books and booksellers, and copy- 
right. 

A pleasing sketch of his boyhood, passed 
mostly on a Hertfordshire farm, forms the 
subject of Mr. ^larston's opening chapter. Eefer- 
ring to the books of poetry and drama read 
'with the keenest enjoyment' by the active- 
minded lad, the mature man doubts whether 
this desultory reading did him much good. We 
should say it certainly did him a great deal of

good, having no small influence in determining 
his future sphere of usefulness, and begetting 
in him a facility in the use of literary allusion 
and poetical quotation that makes itself agree- 
ably manifest in the present volume. At the 
age of twenty-one he went to seek his fortune 
in London, where he soon became connected 
with Sampson Low in the book-publishing busi- 
ness. A partnership with the Lows, father and 
son, followed in 1856, and with several changes 
of location from one street to another, and under 
a varying firm-name, he continued to pub- 
lish books, apparently with increasing success, 
for more than forty years. A memorable inci- 
dent of his early life in London was the death 
and grand public funeral of the Duke of Well- 
ington, the pageantry of woe being witnessed 
by him as the parade passed the company's 
warehouse at 47 Ludgate Hill, Nov. 18, 1852, 
on its way to St. Paul's, where the remains 
were interred. As the writer names July 14 
as the date of the Duke's death, he leaves the 
poor man's soul to wander for four months in 
pitiful quest of some pious hand to bestow the 
rites of sepulture; whereas the actual date of 
demise was September 14. 

Mr. Marston's house has acted as the Eng- 
lish publishers for some of our well-known 
authors, including Holmes, Mrs. Stowe, Louisa 
Alcott, and Captain Mahan. It also published 
a little book for the late Eev. William Milburn, 
the famous blind chaplain of the Senate. After 
giving an account of the culpable careless- 
ness of the doctor who wrought the irreparable 
mischief in Milbum's boyhood, the writer quotes 
from a familiar poem that Mr. Milburn used 
to recite in giving his lecture on blindness. The 
verses, probably known to many, begin thus, — 
*I am old and blind, 
Men point to me as smitten by God's frown.' 
They are entitled ' Milton's Prayer of Pa- 
tience, ' and have often been attributed to the 
blind poet himself. Mr. Marston ascribes them 
to Elizabeth Lloyd, ' a lady of Philadelphia.' 
But, unless we are in error, they were written 
by Elizabeth L. Howell, to whom they are cred- 
ited by Miss Edith Granger in her admirable 
and accurate ' Index to Poetry and Eecitations. ' 
Among other eminent Americans of his acquaint- 
ance, our author pays tribute to the schol- 
arly attainments of Eiihu Burritt, ' the learned 
blacksmith. ' His place of residence is named 
■as Vermont, Mass. ! Not only is there no such 
town in Massachusetts, but Elihu Burritt was 
bom and died in New Britain, Connecticut, 
•although for a while he lived in Worcester, and 
later in Philadelphia, spending also some years 
•abroad. Another error in things American 
occurs in a letter, quoted withoiit correction by 
.the author, in which Dakota is spoken of as a 
;prosperous State. But as the letter is dated 1872, 



statehood for both the Dakotas was still seven- 
teen years in the future. One more correc- 
tion, and we have done. ' R. 0. Houghton, ' 
on page 77, is doubtless a misprint for H. 0. 
Houghton, the late publisher and printer, an 
old friend of our author's. 

Two chapters are devoted largely to Henry 
M. Stanley, whose books were published by 
Mr. Marston's firm, and who was a close friend 
of Mr. Marston. After quoting many letters 
from Stanley, and relating much that is of inter- 
est about him, the author gives an account 
of the lively competition among publishers for 
' In Darkest Africa. ' 

'On Stanley's return I went to Egypt to meet 
him, at his special request by cablegram, and I 
spent a delightful time with him: while there X 
wrote that curious little book, "How Stanley wrote 
'In Darkest Africa,' " It tells the whole story of 
ray visit, and I shall not attempt to tell the story 
over again. I carried away from Cairo a largo; 
portion of the manuscript of "In Darkest Africa." 
The competition which I had to encounter, and 
the correspondence which it involved with pub- 
lishers over the whole of Europe and a good deal 
of Africa, Asia, and America, would fill a large 
volume. I successfully overcame them all. I 
arranged for publication in America, Italy, France, 
Germany, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Den- 
mark, Holland, and Hungary. I am not sure that 
there were not two languages in the latter country. 
The competition for the American issue for this 
work was very great: it narrowed down eventu- 
ally to the bids of Messrs Harper Brothers and 
Charles Scribner's Sons. I was placed in the 
invidious position of being obliged to arbitrate on 
the competition of two friends. The simple method 
was to fix a time and accept the highest bidder. 
Before it was known by Messrs Scribner that the 
settlement was wholly in my hands, young Mr. 
Scribner had started for Cairo, determined to win 
by a coup de main. We passed each other in the 
Mediterranean almost within hail, he outward 
bound and I homeward bound. Mr. Scribner 's visit 
to Cairo, though unnecessary as regarded arrang- 
ing for the book, was as pleasant as mine had been. 
On opening the sealed offers of Messrs. Harper and 
Messrs. Scribner, I found that Messrs. Scribner had 
won. Their offer was a magnificent one, amounting 
to many thousands of pounds, and Messrs. Harper's 
was not very far behind it.' 

Speaking of Stanley's journalistic activity in 
Spain during the Carlist War, the author con- 
cludes with this unintelligible sentence, — 
' Most unfortunately he lost the whole of his 
correspondence on this subject, which had 
appeared in " The New York Herald, " and this 
can hardly now be replaced. ' But is not the 
' Herald ' on file in not a few large libraries ? 

A frankly communicative letter from Captain 
Mahan contains autobiographical matter of 
interest, and may well be drawn on at this 
point. 

'Finally, I may say that the term, "sea power," 
which now has such vogue, was deliberately adopted 
by me to compel attention, and, I hoped, to receive 
currenc3\ Purists, I said to myself, may criticise 
me for marrying a Teutonic word to one of Latin

origin, but I deliberately discarded the adjective, 
"maritime," being too smooth to arrest men's 
attention or stick in their minds. I do not know 
how far this is usually the ease with phrases that 
obtain currencv; my impression is that the origi- 
nator is himself generally surprised at their taking 
hold. I was not surprised in that sense. The 
effect produced was that which I fully purposed; 
but I was surprised at the extent of my success, 
"Sea power," in English at least, seems to have 
come to stay in the sense I used it. "The sea 
Powers" were often spoken of before, but in an 
entirely different manner — not to express, as 1 
meant,' at once an abstract conception and a con- 
crete fact. It may seem odd to you, but I do not 
to this day understand my success. I had done 
what I intended; I recognize that people have 
attributed to me a great success, and have given 
me abundant recognition. I enjoy it and am grate- 
ful; but for the most part I do not myself appre- 
ciate the work up to the measure expressed by 
others. ' 

Many will remember the fright suffered by 
the English at the prospect of a Channel tun- 
nel. The recent friendly agreement concluded 
between England and France has given fresh 
hopes to the advocates of such a tunnel. Mr. 
Marston shrinks at the bare thought, and 
quotes Captain Mahan to the following effect:

The Ideals of the East.* 

The fundamental difference between the Occi- 
dental man and his brother of the Orient is 
psychological. Try as tiiey may, it is impossi- 
ble for Siem to think quite alike. Divergent 
mental processes stand in the way of complete 
mutual understanding. A wide gulf separates 
the man who naturally gives expression to even 
his most imaginative thoughts in direct if not 
prosaic diction, from him who is wont to clothe 
his ideas, ordinary as well as other, in pictur- 
esque and symbolical imagery. Nor is this all. 
The difference is more than one of language 
merely: it is also the thought relation to the 
accumulated beliefs, traditions, and customs of 
the respective races. To the difficulty of bridg- 
ing the chasm we have the testimony of Lafca- 
dio Heam, who still felt himself an alien at 
heart after fourteen years of intimate associa- 
tion with and close study of the Japanese peo- 
ple, — ^years during which he identified himself 
with them in every possible way. Because of 
this difference, and because the art of a people 
is the expression of what is highest and noblest 
in their culture, it has long been realized that 
comprehensive interpretation of the content of 
Japanese art is beyond the capacity of any for- 
eigner. 

In making this statement it is necessary to 
guard against misconception. The art of the 
Orient is not to be judged by a standard differ- 
ent from that which we should apply in consid- 
ering other art. As to its aesthetic value, it 
speaks for itself. In this respect art is a uni- 
versal language. There is not one philosophy 
of art for the East and another for the West. 
The aim of the artist is everywhere the same. 
His impulse is creative; his purpose is to give 
organic balance and internal beauty to an 
arrangement of lines, masses, light and dark, 
and color. The measure of the result as art is 
the power and skill and insight with which these 
elements have been handled. It does not depend 
upon accuracy of representation, which belongs 
to the domain of science, nor upon any story-

telling or preachment whatsoever. As to these 
and other extraneous things, all that is needful 
is that they be so dealt with as not to interfere 
with the aesthetic enjoyment of the spectator. 

But while the subject-matter with which 
artists have to do is only the vehicle for their 
aestlietic appeal, it necessarily brings into their 
work a host of associated ideas. And so, in con- 
sidering the art of a people so widely removed 
from us as the Japanese, we feel the need to 
imderstand much more than the art itself as 
such. Attempts at interpretation have been 
many: some of them are more than creditable to 
their authors and of undoubted value as far as 
they go. But even in their measure of success 
they make it apparent that the autlioritative 
utterance must emanate from one to the manner 
born. The more welcome, therefore, is the mes- 
sage conveyed in ' The Ideals of the East,' from 
the pen of one eminently qualified for the task. 
The author, Okakura Kakuzo — to follow the 
Japanese custom of placing the family name 
first, — is a distinguished scholar and connois- 
seur whose name is well known to every student 
of his country's art. If that art is to retain its 
ancient and distinctive characteristics, and not 
go down before the blighting onslaught of 
commercialism and foreign ideas, it will be 
due in no small degree to his efforts, and to the 
influence of the academy known as the Nippon 
Bijitsuin, of which he is the founder and 
President. 

The book in which Mr. Okakura has sketched 
the evolution of Asiatic art-ideals is written 
with a wealth of knowledge and penetrative 
insight that quite disarm the alien critic, who, 
lacking the broad range of information and 
intuitive comprehension of Oriental thought, 
cannot hope to speak with a certainty equal to 
that of the author. Yet so widely does his 
reading of Indian, Chinese, and Japanese his- 
tory vary from what we have hitherto con- 
ceived, that it is difficult to accept all that he 
says without question. How far, we ask, has 
he built on solid ground, and to what extent on 
mere fable ? His statements are put forth with 
such calm assurance that it may be he has had 
access to sources of authentic information of 
which we as yet remain in ignorance. But the 
burden of proof, as the lawyers say, would seem 
to be upon him to show that there is not a large 
admixture of myth in the alleged facts upon 
which he bases his theory when dealing with 
the early history of the East. 

That, however, may be dismissed as a detail 
not necessarily affecting the force of the 
author's argument, and the more readily when 
we consider the skill and accuracy with which 
he has handled the facts of the later periods. In 
his purview, 'Asia, the great Mother, is for- 
ever One.' The transforming and unifying 



force, he shows us, was not so much Buddhism 
as Indian idealism, of which the religion of 
Gautama is but a phase, though the chief vehi- 
cle by which the culture was diffused. With 
comprehensive vision, Mr. Okakura traces its 
progress step by step-, and has set it forth in a 
brief though clear and convincing summary. 
This occupies more than half of the book; the 
rest is given over to a rapid survey of the his- 
tory of art in Japan viewed in relation thereto. 
In its larger aspect, Japanese art is thus seen 
to be the symbol and expression of all Asian cul- 
ture, — the mirror in which its soul is reflected. 
To prevent its debasement by Hhe scorching 
drought of modem vulgarity' is the cause to 
which Mr. Okakura's talents have been devoted. 
But, as he rightly says, it is to Asia herself that 
the appeal must be made. The outcome, to 
quote his final words, must be ' Victory from 
within, or a mighty death without.' 

Eveiy sentence in this remarkable and sig- 
nificant book is so charged with meaning that 
the reviewer is constantly tempted to linger 
over the separate statements, instead of keeping 
to the argument as a whole. Inviting, too, are 
the felicitous turns of phrase to be found upon 
every page, and the skill with which concep- 
tions involving great difficulty in their verbal 
expression have been clearly set forth. The 
master}^ of the English language which Mr. 
Okakura displays is indeed amazing. For the 
misspelling of his personal name on the title 
page — Kakasu instead of Kakuzo — it may be 
assumed that he is not responsible. It is possi- 
ble that the reader not steeped in Oriental lore 
may find the book too compactly written, some 
of its statements too condensed and allusive for 
easy comprehension. The commentary, it is 
to be hoped, will be supplied by the same hand 
at no distant day, in the shape of a more 
extended and amply illustrated work upon the 
subject. 

' The Awakening of Japan ' is marked by the 
game epigrammatic style and forceful utterance 
that characterize ' The Ideals of the East.' 
Listen to the opening words: 

' The sudden development of Japan has been more 
or less of an enigma to foreign observers. She is 
the country of flowers and ironclads, of dashing 
heroism and delicate tea-cups, — the strange border- 
land where quaint shadows cross each other in the 
twilight of the New and the Old World. Until 
recently the West has never taken Japan seriously. 
It is amusing to find nowadays that such success 
as we have achieved in our efforts to take a place 
among the family of nations appears in the eyes 
of many as a menace to Christendom. In the mys- 
terious, nothing is improbable. Exaggeration is 
the courtesy which fancy pays to the unknown. 
What sweeping condemnation, what absurd praise, 
has not the world lavished en New Japan? We are 
both the cherished child of modern progress and a 
dread resurrection of heathendom — the Yellow 
Peril itself! ' 



1905.] 



THE DIAL

Were not the opinion so frequently expre^ed, 
it would be incredible that anyone should con- 
sider it possible for Japan to have reached her 
present stage of development in fifty years 
by a sudden emergence from a state of half- 
civilization but little removed from barbarism. 
How different is the reality, Mr. Okakura shows 
in this impressive review of the causes that led 
to the downfall of the feudal system and fitted 
the people to assimilate and utilize extraneous 
knowledge when put within their reach. Before 
the awakening came from without, the national 
consciousness had already been stirred by the 
voice within, — the tyranny of the Togugawa 
regime had nearly run its course. 

What Mr. Okakura pleads for so eloquently 
in both of his books is the preservation of 
Asiatic culture. With impassioned fervor he 
asks: 

'If the guilty conscience of some European 
nations has conjured up the specter of a Yellow 
Peril, may not the suffering soul of Asia wail over 
the realities of the "White Disaster! ' 

And again: 

' The venerable East still distinguishes between 
means and ends. The West is for progress, but 
progress toward whatf When material efficiency 
is complete, what end, asks Asia, will have been 
accomplish^! When the passion of fraternity has 
■culminated in universal cooperation, what purpose 
is it to serve? If mere self-interest, where do we 
find the boasted advance! ' 

WTiere indeed? Are not stocks and bonds 
better than art? Is not the smoke of factory 
chimneys grateful to the nostrils of the truly 
enlightened man? Is it not better to be an 
operative than to remain an independent pro- 
ducer? Is not cheapness more desirable than 
quality? That the West can ever accept the 
views of Eastern scholarship in regard to such 
matters, is asking too much. Does it not assert 
that * aggressive nations have no conscience,' 
and that ' In the West, international morality 
remains far below the standard to which indi- 
vidual morality has attained?' 

Notwithstanding the imminence of the White 
Peril, Mr. Okakura's attitude is far from 
despondent. He finds a solid foundation for his 
hopes in the strength of the national spirit and 
the revivals of ancient customs now in progress. 
But he is not happy in citing the names of 
Katsuo, Zesshin, Hogai, and Gaho, to prove 
that the art of old Japan still lives, for Zesshin 
and Hogai were 'gathered to their fathers' 
some years ago. Fortunately, Gaho and Natsuo 
are not the only eminent men among living 
Japanese artists; but in their effort to uphold 
the glories and traditions of the past, they have 
to contend against ' the unfortunately con- 
temptuous attitude which the average Westerner 
assumes toward everything connected with Ori- 
ental civilization,' which, as Mr. Okakura points 



out, tends to destroy the self-confidence of the 
Japanese in their canons of art. The menace is 
from the inroad of Western ideas : the great dif- 
ficulty ' lies in the fact that Japanese art stands 
alone in the world, without immediate possibil- 
ity of any accession or reinforcement from kin- 
dred ideal or technique.' Yet to Western ideas 
as such, Mr. Okakura displays no aversion. 
Only as they tend to destroy the characteristic 
flavor of Asian culture do tiiey arouse his hos- 
tility. In other fields he bids them weloome, 
as, for example, the elevation of the social 
status of womEui, which he warmly commends 
and asserts to be * the elevation of the race.'

A Napoleonic Aftermath.* 



For his two-volume work on Napoleon I., 
published some three years ago, Mr. J. Holland 
Kose received a very general approval, both on 
account of the method of presentation and 
because of the inclusion of new material dis- 
covered by researches in the archives of the Brit- 
ish foreign office. The same author now pre- 
sents a volume of essays most of which deal 
with incidents in, or aspects of, the Napoleonic 
career that could not consistently be treated at 
length in the more formal work, but which yet 
have interest in themselves. All but four of 
these essays have been published in various 
magazines, and those thus published are quite 
distinct from the others in that they are, with 
one exception, largely technical, referring to 
disputed incidents which are primarily of inter- 
est to the historical student alone. Such, for 
example, are the essays on ' A British Agent 
at Tilsit,' an attempt to determine the identity 
of the man who discovered the secret of the 
plans adopted by Napoleon and Alexander in 
their famous interview on the raft at Tilsit, and 
' Britain's Food Supply in the Napoleonic 
War,' a statistical examination of prices to esti- 
mate the effectiveness of the continental block- 
ade. The four new studies deal with larger 
questions of wider interest, though even here 
the reader must have a general familiarity with 
the events of European history during the 
Napoleonic period to understand what Mr. Eose 
is writing about. 

The purpose of the first of these new essays, 
' Wordsworth, Schiller, Fichte, and the Idealist 
Revolt against Napoleon,' is to examine the 
attitude of literary men of genius at the incep- 
tion of the French revolution, and to show how 
and why that attitude was changed by the course 
of political events. Briefly put, Mr. Rose's

[Jan. 16, 



analysis of this change is that these writers, 
and others like Coleridge in England and Czar- 
toryski in Russia, passed from extreme admira- 
tion to extreme hatred for Fraace, because the 
French people were content to sacrifice humani- 
tarian and idealistic principles to material bene- 
fits and military glory. In the case of Words- 
worth, this was due not so much to dislike for 
the person and activities of Napoleon himself 
as to bitter sorrow at the failure of France to 
fulfill the glorious promise of the early revolu- 
tion, when the youth of the nation rejoiced in 
projects full of generous intentions for the 
peoples of all Europe. The early feeling of 
the German writers was much like that of 
Wordsworth, but was in addition strikingly 
lacking in any patriotic national sense, the gene- 
ral tendency of German literature being to deny 
the principle of national or race unity. For 
such men the humiliation and suffering of Ger- 
many under Napoleon's control acted as a cura- 
tive medicine, developing the inherent but hith- 
erto undiscovered sense of loyalty to country, 
and permitting them a patriotic enthusiasm in 
later life that did much to compensate for the 
loss of earlier enthusiasm for French ideals of 
equality. There is nothing in Mr. Rose's exami- 
nation that has not previously been brought out 
by other writers in separate essays on the vari- 
ous individuals enumerated, but they are here 
grouped as representative of a world-wide 
movement which had its unmistakable influence 
in uniting Europe against Napoleon. 

The one reprinted essay of general rather 
than technical interest is ' The Religious Belief 
of Napoleon,' previously published in *The 
Quarterly Review' for October, 1903. Most 
historians have treated very briefly, or have 
passed over in silence the question of actual 
religious belief, though some have defended 
Napoleon as having high moral perceptions even 
though he made no attempt to realize such per- 
ceptions in practise. With such writers moral 
perceptions are made to stand in the place of 
religious belief. It is with the latter alone that 
Mr. Rose is concerned. He finds that Napoleon 
in early life was in no way guided by religious 
belief, and that in the years when he was an 
enthusiast in the cause of the revolution, his 
indifference became contempt. But when Napo- 
leon became a leader and ruler of great masses 
of men, he was quick to recognize the power of 
religious conviction upon others and to utilize 
it as a tool in executing his political plans. 
Thus when at St. Helena, in discussing his 
alliance with the Pope in 1800, and his deter- 
mination to make France Catholic rather than 
Protestant, he said : 

/These parties, by tearing one another to pieces, 
would have annihilated France, and would have 
made her the slave of Europe, when my ambition 



was to make her the mistress of Europe. With the 
aid of Catholicism I should more easily attain all 
my great results. Abroad, Catholicism would keep 
the Pope on my side; and with my influence, and 
our forces in Italy, I did not despair of having, 
sooner or later, by one means or another, the direc- 
tion of this Pope. And thenceforth what an influ- 
ence! What a lever of opinion for the rest of the 
world! Never in all my quarrels with the Pope 
have I touched a dogma.' 

In his earlier career he even applied political 
and military measurements to spiritual author- 
ity, instructing the French minister at Rome 
to 'treat with the Pope as if he had 200,000 
men,' but later he became convinced that such 
spiritual authority had not the weight of a 
feather in the game of world politics. In 1807 
when, just after the battle of Essling, the papal 
nuncio found him and read to him the bull of 
excommunication, Napoleon replied, ' You have 
done your duty; you are a very brave man; I 
esteem you ' ; but he added, ' What can the Pope 
do? I have 300,000 men under my orders. 
With his lightning can he make the arms fall 
from my soldiers' hands ? ' From these and 
similar incidents, Mr. Rose seeks to show that 
Napoleon's attitude toward religion 'was at 
bottom determined by political considerations,' 
and he also denies any real religious change in 
the later years spent at St. Helena. 

Regarding the new essays in this volume it is 
sufficient to say that they serve to emphasize 
the value of the research Avork which Mr. Rose 
has done in the British archives, and to prove 
that in spite of the great number of scholarly 
studies of the Napoleonic era, large deposits of 
unused material still exist. Mr. Rose is at his 
best when dealing with diplomatic history; his 
chief study has been in that direction, and it 
is therefore natural that the principal value of 
the present volume should lie in the essays 
which are diplomatic studies. The remaining 
three of the new papers are of this character. 
' Pitt's Plans for the Settlement of Europe ' is 
a resume of new material bearing on the vari- 
ous proposals made for such settlement during 
Pitt's two administrations. ' Egypt during the 
First British Occupation ' describes among other 
incidents the squabbles of British and French 
officials over the possession of collections made 
by French savants, the terms of the French 
capitulation having forbidden the carrying 
away of historical or scientific relics; the Mari- 
etta stone was involved in this controversy. 
' Austria and the Downfall of Napoleon ' places 
more emphasis than has been customary in his- 
tory upon the importance of the position and 
acts of Austria in 1813 and 1814. All of these 
topics are treated in such a way as to make 
them of general interest, though the proof fur- 
nished is in each case new and of a technical 
nature. Mr. Rose has in fact reached that.

fortunate position where, with a reputation for 
scholarly and careful work solidly established, 
he is able to select larger topics for presenta- 
tion without feeling it necessary to burden his 
readers with an undue amount of mere material 
in way of proof. The new essays in the pres- 
ent volume are an excellent illustration of this.

A WOMAX'S REMryiSCENCES OF 

Peace and TTar.* 



It is not often that we are given at the same 
time two such entertaining and instructive vol- 
umes of reminiscences as those of Mrs. Clay and 
Mrs. Pryor, both of which recently appeared. 
Both cover the same period — the fifties and the 
sixties; and both depict the same places and 
scenes and people — Washington in the decade 
before the. war, Kichmond and the Confederacy, 
and the ruin of the South. Mrs. Clay was a 
brilliant, wise, witty woman of the worid in 
the time she describes, a leader in Washington 
society; Mrs. Prjor was also of that society, 
but more inclined to the pleasures of the domes- 
tic circle. Her book gives us a better under- 
standing of the life of Confederate women 
than does that of Mrs. Clay, who writes princi- 
pally of official personages. 

Mrs. Pr3or is the wife of one who has had a 
varied career, — newspaper editor in Richmond 
and Washington, special minister to Greece, 
elected in 1856 to Congress, and after secession 
a Confederate Congressman, a colonel, a general, 
and a private soldier. Since the war he has 
become known as one of the ablest of Xew 
York law}-ers, a prominent politician in Xew 
York state, and judge of its Supreme Couri;. 
Mrs. Pnor devotes six interesting chapters to 
her Washington life, — to descriptions of the 
official society and the notable persons whom she 
knew, the fashions and manners of the fifties, 
the entertainments of ante-bellum Washington, 
and of the stormy session of the last Congress 
of the old Union. Washington was then in 
some respects a provincial capital, with only a 
political and therefore floating population ; but 
we have Mrs. Prs'ors word that it was a very 
pleasant place in which to live, and in the spring 
a very pretty country town. Though the 'old 
residents' held aloof, official society was then 
composed of people who were there because they 
were of importance at home ; there were few of 
the modem ' plutocrats ' who now go to Wash- 
ington to get the social privileges denied them 
elsewhere. In those days, literary men found 
Washington a pleasant place to live in; and 
President Fillmore gathered about him su ch

men as G. P. R. James, John P. Kennedy, 
Washington Irving, and other men of letters. 
But when sectional passions ran high, everj'- 
thing was forgotten save politics, and the death 
of Irving was almost unnoticed on account of 
the hanging of John Brown. Under Pierce and 
Buchanan, and with the growth of the Republi- 
can party, sectional lines began to be drawn in 
social Ufe. Extremists seldom and seldomer 
met. Naturally, imder Democratic Presidents 
the official society was predominantly Demo- 
cratic; and among the Democrats the influence 
of Southerners, men and women, was strongly 
felt. It was Admiral Porter's theory, that had 
Washington been a livelier place, with more 
amusements and diversions, during the last two 
administrations before the war, the Southerners 
would not have seceded. On account of family 
bereavement, Mrs. Pierce did not entertain; and 
Buchanan was a solitary old bachelor who did 
not understand the meaning of amusement. 

However, Mrs. Pryor describes a splendid 
regime in those few years before the end. Wash- 
ington suppers of the late fifties almost rivalled 
the feasts of the Roman emperors. But there 
were drawbacks. At one of President Buchan- 
an's dinners, Mrs. Pryor was taken in by a 
backwoods Congressman who had stimulated 
himself too freely, and distressed Mrs. Pryor 
by winking at Miss Harriet Lane, the niece of 
the President. The coming of the first Japa- 
nese embassy was an event in Washington his- 
tory, and Mrs. Pryor became the proud first 
American possessor of a Japanese fan. 

Of fashions and dressmakers of the period, 
Mrs. Pryor has much to say. Her philosophy 
of dress will be interesting to the present age. 
Those were leisurely, spacious, expansive times, 
when there was still plenty of room in the 
world, and people dressed accordingly. We are 
told that the immense hoopskirts and marvel- 
lous headgear were not ugly, but were weU 
suited to expensive dressing. Incidentally it 
comes out that dresses were extremely low in 
the neck, and that sermons were then preached 
against them; but having been invented about 
1280 and preached against since then, Mrs. 
Pr}or predicts they will survive. That men 
have no business interfering in affairs of dress, 
she evidently believes, and illustrates by Mr. 
Marcy's case. He, when Secretary of State, 
ordered American ministers abroad to appear 
only in plain civilian dress. At several courts 
the ministers were informed that to wear such 
dress would be considered disrespectful. Mr. 
Buchanan, in England, when Parliament 
opened, ' had nothing to wear,' and his absence 
came near causing an inquiry in Parlia- 
ment. Finally he appeared at court in the pre- 
scribed civilian dress, but wearing a sword 'to 
distinguish myself from the upper court serv-

ants.' Such was the effect of a man's med- 
dling with matters of dress. 

Washington life on the eve of war was not 
pleasant. People were restless and fevered 
with anxiety ; political questions affected society, 
and there was no longer much intercourse 
between people of the South and those of the 
]!^orth. Mrs. Douglas cut all her husband's 
opponents; and many others did likewise. The 
Battle of the Giants was on in Congress, and 
members spoke for days on the state of the 
country. All else was neglected for this. Mem- 
bers were wild with passion, and bitter lan- 
^age aroused bitter feelings. Friends of many 
years no longer greeted one another. President 
Buchanan prayed that secession might 'not 
•come in my time, ' and almost died of anxiety. 
When South Carolina seceded he was at a wed- 
ding-party; and it fell to Mrs. Pryor to break 
the news to him. She says that he was stunned. 

After the inauguration of President Lincoln, 
Mrs. Pryor went with her husband to the great 
gathering of the Virginians, who came from 
all over the world when the rallying-cry was 
the exhortation of old Sir George Somers of 
the ' Sea Venture,' — ' Be true to duty, and 
return to Virginia.' Few failed to obey the call. 
'* The very earth trembled at the tramp of the 
Virginians, as they marched to the assize of 
arms of the Mother of them all.' Then fol- 
lowed the enthusiastic preparation for the 
impending conflict. Volunteers were fitted out 
jand sent to the front. At first Mrs. Pryor endeav- 
ored to keep near her husband, who was in the 
army; but this was difficult, so she sent her 
•children to relatives while she herself nursed 
the sick and wounded in the hospitals. During 
the last years of the war she gathered her little 
family together in Petersburg, almost within 
the battle-lines ; and there, in the midst of the 
siege, in danger and in want, she fought the 
wolf from the door, just as did so many other 
Southern women. Her Washington finery was 
made over and sold to the wives of speculators 
in Richmond. Such expedients carried the 
family through the last dark days before the 
surrender, when the husband and father was in 
a, Northern prison. 

Some of the letters quoted tell more than 
has been generally known before of the desper- 
ate condition of the poorer people of Eichmond 
long before the war ended. There is a descrip- 
tion, for instance, of the rising of the women in 
the 'Bread Eiot.' The original account of Gen- 
eral Lee's bit of borrowed bacon is here given. 
On one occasion he had two biscuits for break- 
fast, and gave one of them to an Irish member 
of Parliament who was visiting him. Lee's 
quarters at Petersburg were near Mrs. Pryor's 
home. 



The plundering propensities of Federal sol- 
diers are compared with the conduct of the 
Confederates under Lee and of the British 
under Comwallis, to the discredit of the former. 
McClellan, Mrs. Pryor declares, was a gentie- 
raan, but some of the other Federal command- 
ers were not. There is a ludicrous glimpse of 
Sheridan, who, after seizing Mrs. Pryor's house 
for his own use, sends her his photograph. And 
there was a New England officer who, after 
having taken General Pr^'or's fine horse, wrote 
back informing the General of the horse's 
good health, and asking for its pedigree. 

There was nothing to do in Virginia after the 
war. So Mrs. Pryor pawned her watch and 
ring, and with the money, Roger A. Pryor, ex- 
' rebel ' General and Congressman, went to New 
York to start anew. 

These memoirs show unconsciously the differ- 
ence between the Border South and the Lower 
South of 1861. In secession the Virginians 
held back, and there was a strong Union party 
until the last, but it died in a day when Lincoln 
called for troops. Mrs. Pryor criticizes some- 
what the policy of the Confederacy, — directed, 
it will be remembered, by men of the Lower 
South, — blaming the leaders for the war and 
for dragging it out after longer resistance was 
hopeless. She did not expect secession when it 
came, and, like other Virginians, expected much 
from the Virginia Peace Commission. She says 
that in 1860 the people of Charleston turned the 
cold shoulder to the Northern delegates to the 
Democratic Convention, thus widening the 
breach between North and South. The Rich- 
mond admtnstration is mildly but persistently 
criticised. In this connection Mrs. Pryor calls 
attention to a rather important fact: There 
never was any official recognition of gallant 
action by the Confederate government, no men- 
tion in orders, no medals, no promotion on the 
field. Davis, the author believes, opposed Pryor's 
further promotion after he had been made 
brigadier-general; consequently Pryor resigned 
and entered the ranks as a private soldier. It 
should be remembered, however, that the Presi- 
dent was also severely criticised by the Gulf 
States Congressmen for partiality to Virginians, 
and especially for making Pryor a brigadier- 
general. It will always be difficult for Vir- 
ginians to understand how much the Lower 
South sacrificed for Richmond during the last 
years of the war. 

The reminiscences are brightly told ; there is 
little dwelling on the dark side of things, and 
the tendency of the book is irenic. As a contri- 
bution to the history of the period it is of value 
not so much for the facts set forth as for the 
color and feeling that can be found only in these 
first-hand accounts. Walter L. Fleming.

THE DIAL

IX THE Realm of the Bibee.* 



Recent years liave seen notable progress in 
the conception and statement of the character 
-and scope of biblical theolog}'. German works 
in considerable numbers have devoted their 
pages to its treatment, but it was conceded that 
"the final word had been by no means spoken on 
this vital theme. ' The International Theologi- 
<?al Library ' projected a work on this line sev- 
eral years ago. and secured the consent of Pro- 
fessor Davidson of Edinburgh to prepare it. 
Years swept by with no visible completion of 
the task, until the death of Dr. Davidaon in 
1902, As a consequence of this calamity, Prin- 
■cipal Salniond undertook to edit the manu- 
scripts that were probably designed, at some 
later date, to constitute the promised volume on 
the Biblical Theolog}^ of the Old Testament. 
The editor found no easy task in preparing for 
publication manuscripts that had had several 
revisions at the hand of the author. But the 
work has been done ^ith great conscientious- 
ness, and as a rule with eminent success ; and it 
lias given iis in permanent form some of the 
fundamental principles of the Old Testament 
:as seen and interpreted by one of the leading 
Old Testament scholars of this age. The chap- 
ter arrangement of the volume is significant, as 
embodying in the authors mind the dominating 
ideas of the Old Testament. The chapters dis- 
<niss (1) the science of Old Testament theology, 
{2) the doctrine of God, (3) the Divine nature, 
{4) the Spirit of God, (5) the Divine attri- 
butes, (6) the doctrine of good and evil, (7) 
sin, (8) the doctrine of redemption, (9) supra- 
human good and evil, (10) priesthood and 
atonement. (11) the doctrine of the last things 
— ^the Messianic idea, (12) immortalitv*. These 
themes are treated not by the chronological but 
by the topical method. 

Dr. Davidson's known views of the Old Testa- 
ment led us to expect a discussion of each theme 
on the basis of its development or growth. But 
in this we are somewhat disappointed. Though 
a cautious critic, his caution seems to have 
restrained him from giving everywhere an up-to- 
date scientific treatment of Ms subject. He 
accepts the analysis of the Pentateuch, of the 
historical books, and of the double assignment 
of Isaiali. Xevertheless, he gives a timely word 
of warning against the extreme radical tenden- 
cies of the modem critical school. This work

has some features that are a positive gain for 
biblical students. Dr. Davidson was a mas- 
ter of careful word-study, and of close discrimi- 
nation between the inherent meanings of words; 
indeed, upon this very feature much of the 
detail of Old Testament theolog)'^ depends. 
He breaks up into clear divisions the mass of 
great truths contained in the Old Testament. 
The book throbs with a large and living con- 
ception of the scope and sweep of revelation, and 
the relations that exist between the Old and 
N^ew* Testaments. Students of the Bible will 
find here, as in the authors useful little Cam- 
bridge Bible commentaries on several Old Tes- 
tament books, containing incisive, profitable, and 
helpful discussions of some of the fundamental 
doctrines of the Old Testament. 

Hastings's * Dictionary of the Bible,' com- 
pleted in 1902, in four volumes, is a monu- 
mental work. But its compass and treatment 
could not include all the themes which a Bible- 
student of to-day expects to find in such a dic- 
tionary. Besides, the last five years have seen 
several important discoveries that affect the 
interpretation of the Old and New Testaments, 
and these should be put within the reach of 
Bible-students by men who can speak authori- 
tatively. As time progresses, there are more 
and more themes that must demand the careful 
consideration of every student of the Scrip- 
tures. An ' Extra Volume ' has been prepared 
and published to meet just this new require- 
ment. It contains thirty-eight articles by spe- 
cialists, covering several of the most important 
side-issues of the Bible-students. Some of the 
most notable, for the newness of matter or the 
length of the contribution, are the following: 
' Agrapha,' by Professor Eopes of Harvard ; 
' Code of Hammurabi,' by Mr. Johns of Cam- 
bridge ; ' Papyri,' by Professor Buhl of Copen- 
hagen : ' Eeligion of Babylonia and x^ssyria,' by 
Professor Jastrow of University of Pennsylva- 
nia ; * Eeligion of Israel,' by Professor Kautzsch 
of Halle ; ' Sermon on the Mount,' by Professor 
Yotaw of University of Chicago ; and ' Textual 
Criticism of the New Testament,' by Dr. Mur- 
ray of Canterbury. Each of these contributions 
puts into the hands of Bible-studente matter of 
authoritative value, and the best that we may 
hope to have for some years to come. The arti- 
cle on the ' Eeligion of Israel' covers 123 
double-column pages, is very exhaustive, and 
would make a large volume as books are made 
to-day. The last 200 pages contain the working 
apparatus for the entire work, inclusive of this 
extra volume. They include the name of each 
^\-riter and his contributions, an alphabetic list 
of all themes discussed in the entire work, an 
index of Scripture passages and other 
literature, a full list of Hebrew and Greek 
words, an index to the all-too-few illustrations.

[Jan. 16, 



and a list of the thirteen maps that embellish 
the five volumes. The completion of this great 
work for Biblical students and scholars is a tri- 
umph. Its comprehensiveness, its scholarship, 
its progres&iveness, and its aggressiveness, give 
it first place among all dictionaries of the Bible 
in the English language. 

Professor Genung's ' Epic of the Inner Life/ 
a study of the Book of Job, has won a place in 
the literature of that noble book. The same 
author has now turned his attention and thought 
to another book of the Old Testament that has 
proved to be a riddle to many readers. This 
work is based on sound scholarship, and pro- 
ceeds along the highway of literary excellence. 
About the first half of the volume is given to a 
frank discussion of ' The Book and its World,' 
followed by * Koheleth's Response to his Time,' 
''The Issue in Character,' and ^The Literary 
Shaping.' The author is at his best in dealing 
with current questions regarding this puzzling 
book. His discussion reveals a well-balanced 
sense of the literary and spiritual values that 
are to be found in Koheleth, that is, the 
preacher. The long-discussed and troublesome 
questions as to the authorship of Ecclesiastes 
are surveyed so as to give the reader an idea of 
some of the problems that must be dealt with 
in any interpretation that may be adopted. The 
last half of the volume is a new translation 
of the book out of the Hebrew, with a summary 
of thought on the margins. On the lower part 
of each page there is a commentary, in smaller 
type, which puts certain words and phrases 
under the exegetieal microscope. In summing 
up, the author says : ' The new question in vir- 
tual control is. What is that thing reward after 
all, — that object to which all life and labor are 
so prevailingly keyed? The truest answer to 
all questions is in conclusion " Fear God and 
keep his commandments, for this is the sum 
of manhood." ' Ir^ M. Price.

moved among his fellows. The attempt is always 
a bold one, and he who makes it must be excep- 
tionally endowed with sympathy and penetrative 
insight. Among the most ingenious and success- 
ful experiments upon this baffling theme must 
surely be reckoned the little two-act drama of Dr. 
Garnett, by him entitled 'William Shakespeare, 
Pedagogue and Poacher, ' and made to deal with 
the deer-stealing episode of the poet's legendary 
youth. Here we have the young Shakespeare, 
hardly more than a lad, but some time since 
entrapped into marriage with a shrewish and 
puritanical woman several years his senior, and 
already planning for emancipation and the free 
life of London. Indeed, he has already des- 
patched to a friend in the city the first fruits of 
his invention, a comedy entitled 'The Taming of 
a Shrew,' for which his own domestic experiences 
have afforded abundant material in the way of 
characterization, although for the taming process 
he must perforce draw upon his imagination. 
The deer-stealing escapade is the central feature 
of Dr. Garnett 's play, and in consequence thereof 
Shakespeare and the scholars who have joined 
him in the moonlight adventure are haled before 
the outraged justice of Sir Thomas Lucy. Sir 
Thomas is by way of being a euphuist, and Lady 
Lucy, who once had secret leanings toward the 
yooithful poet, is piqued that he should have 
become the possession of Mistress Hathaway. At 
the close, he is saved from condign punishment 
by the api>earance of Lord Leicester, who comes 
as a. messenger from the Queen (to whom the 
comedy has been read) and bears the poet away 
to the court. W^e quote the lines in which Ann 
Shakespeare advises Sir Thomas that the lash 
would be a proper punishment for her erring 
spouse. 

' Long have I groaned o'er William's evil courses. 

And mourned to know my household fed by rapine, 

And my own stomach's pure integrity 

Polluted by his depredations. 

How oft when spit hath turned, or caldron bubbled. 

Mid savoury smells and steams have I with voice 

Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman. 

Demanded, William, whence this venison? 

And he would laugh, and cite some silly tale 

Of Theseus or the ghost of Heme the Hunter. 

Pardon I pray not then, but penalty 

Conducive to his reformation; 

Like lightning, sanctifying where it strikes, 

And in my poor conceit, the lash, applied 

By loving spirits wielding arms of flesh 

Best scared this poaching devil out of him. ' 

He is not to be punished too severely, but just 
enough to make him helpless for a few days,, 
wherein the faithful wife Taay find her oppor- 
tunity to chide him for his misdeeds. 

' Beseech you then of your great charity 
Suffer the sinner's weal to overpoise 
The burdened scale of his transgressions, 
Using such nice adjustment of the lash 
As but a week may bind him to his bed. 
Where he may call Repentance to efface 
The long score he hath run up with the Fiend, 
And be his own inquisitor, things past 
Summoning to sessions of sweet silent thought. 
Save when I moralise the spectacle. ' 

Shakespeare's defense in court is of a nature 
to enrage Sir Thomas beyond measure, and the 
luckless poet is condemned to the three-fold pen-

alty of flogging, imprisonment, and banishment 
from the shire. Handed over to the constable for 
execution, the latter says: 

' Sir Thomas, I'm afeared to touch the man. 
Thou heardest? he hath a familiar spirit. 
Perchance an impish sootikin, but haply 
Tail-switching Lucifer, Hell's emperor.' 

To this Shakespeare replies: 

' Aye, man, I hold in fee ten thousand spirits. 
And more can summon from the vasty deep. 
Who at my word shall seize thy knight and thee 
And set bemocked upon the public stage. 
Stuff for the himaourous world's derision.' 

It will have been noticed from the above extracts 
that Dr. Gamett has made a large use of 
Shakespearian lines, distributing them impar- 
tially among the several characters. This is one 
of the noteworthy features of the drama, and may 
be further illustrated by the following striking 
words, placed in Shakespeare's mouth when he 
announces to his wife his early departure for 
^prodigious London': 

' And I will seek a manly soul, and wear him 
In my heart's core, even in my heart of hearts. 
And in high verse I will eternise him. 
Blazoning his beauty forth, his name concealing 
To set the wide world wondering who he was. 
And sharp debate shall drain the inky stands 
Of sage and scholar labouring to divine 
If worth it was of his, or wit of mine. ' 

Such is Dr. Gamett 's way of accounting for 
the mysterj- of the sonnets. 

'The Sin of David,' by Mr. Stephen Phillips, 
is a modem version (not too modem) of the 
adulterous love of the King of Israel and the 
wife of Uriah the Hittite. The scene is Eng- 
land, the epoch that of the Cromwellian wars. 
Sir Hubert Lisle, commander of a section of the 
Parliamentary forces, is captivated by the young 
wife of Colonel Mardyke, an aged and austere 
puritan, and, to clear his path, despatehes the 
latter upon an errand that means ceii^in death. 
For several years thereafter, he enjoys the fruits 
of his despicable act as far as an uneasy consci- 
ence will permit, but in the end is sadly stricken 
by the judgment of God in the death of the child 
that the woman has borne to him. Her eyes also 
are opened by this calamity, and she at first turns 
from her husband with loathing, but afterwards 
consents to a sort of chastened reconciliation. 
This old story of sin and expiation is told in the 
simplest form; the work is bare of ornament or 
accessory, and its poignancy is all the more effect- 
ive for the severe priming of the author's imagi- 
nation. The verse is, as we had a right to expect 
from Mr. Phillips, dignified and filled with a 
haunting melodious charm. It is best exhibited 
by passages of one or two lines, such as 

'Thou hast unlocked the loveliness of earth, ' 

or as 

' And I must bide, till this full beauty drop 
"Which even divinity did flush to dream, ' 
or as 

' How o'er the Fenland hath grown fairy land 
And all these levels gleam as passionate 
As the high gardens of Assyrian Kings. ' 

Longer passages are not so easy of extraction, 
but the one following may, perhaps, be held an 
adequate illustration of this latest work of an 
accomplished poet in its more sustained flights. 



The passage is all but the closing one of this 

three-act drama. 

' Our former marriage, though by holy bell 
And melody of lifted voices blest, 
Was yet in madness of the blood conceived 
And bom of murder : therefore is the child 
Withdrawn, that we might feel the sting of flesh 
Corruptible ; yet he in that withdrawal 
Folded upon the bosom of the Father, 
Hath joined us in a marriage everlasting; 
Marriage at best of spirit, not of sense. 
Whose ritual is memory and repentance. 
Whose sacrament this deep and mutual wound. 
Whose covenant the all that might have been. 
And to this troth majestic shadows throng. 
And stand about as in dumb sympathy. 
In presence of these silent witnesses. 
And one perchance that carrieth now a babe, 
I take in mine thy hand and call thee wife — 
Wife, wife, till the grave-shattering trumpet ! ' 

If the public of a century ago was startled and 
shocked by the, audacity of Byron 's ' Cain, ' it is 
interesting to speculate concerning what its emo- 
tions would have been could it have foreseen the 
'Cain' of Mr. George Cabot Lodge. For Mr. 
Lodge has still further allegorized the Biblical 
allegory, and boldly presented the flgure of the 
first murderer as that of a Prometheus or Savior 
of mankind. He slays Abel, not from envy or a 
sudden fit of anger, but with reasoned and elo- 
quently defended purpose, because he sees in the 
cringing and submissive nature of his brother a 
menace to the future generations that might 
spring from his loins. 

' The cause is grave beyond thy power of thought 

And holds dominion both for thee and me. 

Who share the self-same trust and equally 

Safeguard the sacred heritage of life. 

We are not merely men but more than men 

Since we are pregnant of futurity. 

We are not measured by the fretful years 

That span our being, since we store the seed 

Of myriad generations yet unborn. 

We are the start of young humanities ! 

We are the spring and freshet of mighty streams. 

That thro' the reach of the imending years. 

As thro' vast fields where darkness wars with dawn. 

Shall keep their fruitful and resistless way ! 

We have within us such an utterance 

As once proclaimed shall peal forevermore. 

Echoed and multiplied from age to age, 

Down thro* the endless labyrinth of time I 

We are the scabbard of a sword of flame. 

We are the wardens of the House of Life, 

We are the guardians of a sacred fire. 

We are the gates of Dawn, — the First of Men ! 

Such is the cause ! — for this we shall not yield 

The torch of freedom to the winds of fear. 

Nor blight the burgeon from the seed of truth 

With frost of lies or dust of ignorance ! 

Nay, we must shield the torch and gruard the flower; 

We must be perfect in our sacred trust ; 

We must preserve, in strength and faith and love. 

Our whole inheritance that all may share ! — 

Not for the safety of a mean content. 

Not in the terrour of a wrathful God, 

Shall we renounce the treasure and the task. 

Or sell the birthright of the Sons of Man !' 

And so, deliberately and with love for his 
brother in his heart, Cain slays Abel, and, seek- 
ing their mother afterward, justifies his act. 
Wrung by her grief, she is nevertheless persuaded 
by his eloquence, and blesses him in the end. 
' Till now my tears have blinded me ; at last 
I see and know — thou art the Son of Man, 
Thou art the Saviour — and my son, my son ! 
Love and forgive me ! for the blood of Abel 
Rose, a red mist between thy soul and mine ! 
Now I am weak no more ; I say to thee : 



48 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16> 



Go forth, go forth ; lonely and godlike man ! 
My heart will follow tho' my feet must stay.' 

After this tender and moving scene of parting, 
Cain goes forth to take up his burden, much as 
Prometheus goes to meet his doom in Mr. Moody's 
poem of 'The Fire-Bringer. ' 

' Farewell ! my will and mine alone 

Has made me outcast from the laws of men. 

And from God's laws, and from the homes of men. 

I am the man I am : no cause but this 

Hast cast me naked and lonely from the pale. 

To wander, alien in the Academe, 

Cursed and derided in the market-place. 

Slandered and scourged before the shrines of God. 

O I shall weary with all the woes of the world ! 

And when I shall lift up the immortal light 

Like dawn in the dark places of men's souls. 

All men shall hail it as a ruinous fire 

Born for their world's destruction ; they shall rise. 

Nerved with ferocious fear, and hale me forth. 

Seize me, traduce me, judge me, and condemn, — 

And press the hemlock to my unshrinking lips 

Or nail my scourged flesh naked to the cross ! ' 

The solemn burden and the stately march of 
this fine poem has been impressively illustrated 
by the foregoing passages. It remains to give 
one brief example of Mr. Lodge's diction in a 
tender and lyrical mood. The words are Abel's, 
just as he is about to make his sacrifice at the 
altar. 

' The golden sandals of reluctant day 
Climb the broad shoulders of the heavenward hills. 
Earth fills with darkness like a shallow bowl 
And sleep weighs down the weary lids of life. 

peace of God, vigil of God's great love, 

1 feel you now, in vast serenity. 
Brood like a benediction on the world ! ' 

The scheme of this work is as simple as possi- 
ble. The only speakers are Adam, Eve, Cain, and 
Abel, unless we add the voice of God, heard 
from time to time. Of the three acts, the first 
belongs mainly to Adam and Eve, the second to 
the brethren and the tragedy, the third to Cain's 
reconciliation with his mother. The diction of 
the poem is almost as severe as its outline, and is 
sustained throughout at a lofty pitch. 

The three dramas thus far described are 
strictly closet affairs ; no one would think of plac- 
ing them upon the boards of any actual stage. 
With Mr. Aldrich's 'Judith of Bethulia' the case 
is different, for this drama was written not only 
with an eye to stage-production in general, but 
as a vehicle for the talent of a particular actress. 
The actual performance, with Miss O'Neil in the 
titular part, took place in Boston last October. 
The four acts of the play, moreover, are based 
upon the author's poem of 'Judith and Holo- 
f ernes,' from which lines and lengthy passages 
are freely borrowed and incorporated into the 
dramatic work. We select for reproduction the 
climacteric passage, the monologue of Judith in 
the tent, just before she slays the sleeping 
Holofemes. 

' I did not longer dare to look on him. 
Lest I should lose my reason through my eyes. 
This man — this man, had he been of my race, 
And I a maiden, and we two bad met — 
What visions mock me ! Some ancestral sin 
Hath left a taint of madness in my bra,in. 
Were I not I, I would unbind my hair 
And let the tresses cool his fevered cheek, 
And take him in my arms — Oh, am I mad? 
Yonder the watch-fires fiare upon the walls. 
Like red hands pleading to me through the dark ; 



There famished women weep, and have no hope. 

The moan of children moaning in the streets 

Tears at my heart. O God! have I a heart? 

Why do I falter ! Thou that rulest all. 

Hold not Thy favor from me that I seek 

This night to be Thy instrument ! Dear Lord, 

Look down on me, a widow of Judea, 

A feeble thing unless Thou sendest strength ! 

A woman such as I slew Sisera. 

The hand that pierced his temples with a nail 

Was soft and gentle, like to mine, a hand 

Moulded to press a babe against her breast ! 

Thou didst sustain her. Oh, sustain Thou me 

That I may free Thy chosen from their chains ! — 

Each sinew in my body turns to steel, 

My pulses quicken, I no longer fear ! 

My prayer has reached Him, sitting there on high! 

The hour is come I dreamed of ! This for thee 

O Israel, my people, this for thee ! ' 

This is probably the finest page of a book that 
is dignified and impressive throughout, a book not 
unworthy of the trained artistic hand which 
brings it to us as a gift. 

'Tristan and Isolde' is a tragedy by Mr. Louis 
K. Anspacher. Structurally, it is weakened by 
being dragged out through five acts, instea-d of 
the three in which the unening dramatic instinct 
of Wagner realized that it must be moulded. In 
the present work, the voyage to Cornwall is sup- 
pressed altogether, its happenings being related 
after the discovery of Tristan's faithlessness. 
Mr. Anspacher has also introduced several subsi- 
diary characters whose presence tends to make 
the action diffuse. As an example of his verse, 
we quote a passage spoken by King Mark in the 
third act. 

' We three can never dwell beneath one roof ; 

Tintagel Castle, where King Uther died, 

The mighty founder of a line of Kings, 

Is now too small to hold its three possessors. 

My human pity never learned revenge ; 

There is no malice in my punishment. 

The pillory of public banishment 

Will not be pressed on thee ; but thou must go. 

Parting as secretly as thou hast come. 

Thou art not pure enough to seek the Grail ; 

For he who compasses that high devoir 

Must guiltless be, and pure as virgin lilies. 

Go, then, thy better self will pray for thee ; 

Devote thyself to vows and blessed works; 

Until the saints, whose joy is saving souls. 

Absolve thy heart. I, too, in time, shall add 

What prayers forgiveness may find tongue to speak. 

My blessings go as wayfarers with thee. 

Go, go ; I never wish to see thy face again.' 

As will been seen from these lines, which are 
among the best to be found in the drama, the 
work is uninspired and mechanical. It is aa 
exercise in metrical composition rather than a 
creative product. 

Under the title of 'The Red Branch Crests' 
Mr. Chai-les Leonard Moore has versified three 
Celtic legends. The poems are dramatic in form 
and each is in from six to ten scenes. The form is 
a verse of seven syllables and four accents, and 
the lines are in rhymed couplets. There are 
a few irregularities, but the verse keeps fairly 
close to the norm. It is favorably illustrated by 
the closing passage, the lament spoken after the- 
death of Cuchulain and his men. 

' Slaughtered host and slaughtered King 
Lie in one vast battle ring. 
From his final field of fame 
Bear the matchless form of flame !

Floods of foes that round him welled, 

Baffled, backward, down, he quelled I 

Brin weep, thy hero gone. 

Unto Alba, Britain known. 

Known to Pict and known to Dane, 

Famous o'er the ocean plain — 

Weep, but triumph ! For he shall 

Blaze above Death's blackest pall. 

Islands of remotest reach. 

Utmost lands of unknown speech. 

Races hid in Time's far womb. 

Unto these he shall untomb. 

Shall revealed in splendor stand 

The glory of his native land. 

Tongue of poet, hero heart. 

Till from the dry earth those depart. 

Shall echo ever, ever name 

Cuchulain's deeds, Cucbulain's fame.' 

The three sections of Mr. Moore's poem, united 
into one fateful web, are respectively entitled 
'Deirdre,' 'Meve/ and 'Cuchulain.' They exploit 
with vigor and dramatic effect what is perhaps 
the most familiar cycle of Celtic legend. The 
experiment is interesting and fairly successful 
from a poetical point of view, although its mate- 
rial must ever be alien to English modes of con- 
sciousness. We can take to our hearts nearly all 
the forms of classical and Teutonic legend, but 
the Celtic treasury, rich though it be, seems to 
us a thing of remote imaginings, motives, and 
agencies. William Morton Txynh.

Dr. William Everett, at the begin- 

The modem • ^ l- i imi. 

itcaian poets. ^^S 01 tis volume upon The 
Italian Poets since Dante' (Serib- 
ner), makes some cogent remarks upon the recent 
English neglect of the most charming of mod- 
em literatures. Time was when the best English 
poets got their finest inspiration from Italian 
sources, and when Italian literature was known as 
familiarly to cultivated people as French or Ger- 
man literature is now. But that time has van- 
ished, and the Italian 'language holds by no 
means the same place in our courses of study as 
the German, which was little more than a collec- 
tion of imcouth dialects centuries after Dante, 
Petrarch, and Boccaccio had made their tongue 
the vehicle of the loftiest, the tenderest, and the 
wittiest ideas.' Thus it has come about in our 
own day that 'manj' men and women would be 
ashamed to confess ignorance of Heine and 
Uhland, of Victor Hugo and Verlaine, who would 
see no disgrace in admitting that Guarini and 
Alfieri, Leopardi and Carducci, were sealed books 
to them.' Dante alone we read and know; his 
successors are little more than names to us. It 
was for the purpose of calling renewed attention 
to this great and unduly neglected literature that 
Dr. Everett prepared the course of Lowell Insti- 



tute lectures that are reprinted in the present 
volume. He entered upon the task with an 
enthusiasm bom of a large and loving acquain- 
tance with the poets of Italy, and he succeeds in 
imparting no little of this emotion to his readers. 
*For this work,' he says, 'I claim one qualifica- 
tion. The sound of their beautiful language has 
sung in my ears from my very earliest infancy. 
On the sacred soil of Florence and Fiesole, before 
the memory of events begins, I drank in the music 
of Tuscan equally with the notes of my own 
tongue. I can remember no hour in which every- 
thing Italian was not set before me as a source 
of supreme interest. Many here know Italy bet- 
ter than I do; none but a native can love her 
more.' Of the eight chapters in Dr. Everett's 
book, three are devoted to Petrarch, Ariosto, and 
Alfieri. The other five discuss an average of 
three poets each, from Pulci to Leopardi. In 
each ease the biographical and critical characteri- 
zation is followed by a series of representative 
selections, given sometimes in the author's own 
translation, sometimes in that of others. The 
work is luminous and vivid in style, and a delight 
to the instinct of every lover of literature. Nor 
is it made any the less delightful by the infusion 
of the author's individuality, and the occasional 
exhibition of a fine old crusted prejudice. We 
think none the less of him for saying that 
'Boiardo's avoidance of all melody might entitle 
him to be named Richard Wagner,' for he takes 
pains to inform us upon another page that he 
cares nothing for music. And so he will prob- 
ably to the end of his days cherish the delusion 
.that the author of 'Die Meistersinger' — the 
most melodious of all musical creations— was 
incapable of melody. A bit of old fogyism crops 
out now and then, as in the judgment of the 
modem fashion 'which thinks it high criticism 
to say that Homer is not the perfection of poetry, 
and "Marmion" is not a p>oem at all,' or in the 
remarks about Columbus and his contemporaries, 
* whose colonial exploits we are now so absurdly 
undervaluing in order to crown with laurels the 
mythical Leif and Thorwald. ' But many idiosyn- 
eracies may be pardoned a writer who can give 
us (p. 138) the eloquent panegyric ui>on Milton, 
and many another purple patch revealed in these 
pages. The only words we carmot quite forgive 
him are those in which he speaks of ' the ferocity 
of Dante. ' From the point of view of the scholar, 
little exception is to be taken to this work. It is 
true that Dr. Everett takes as unquestioned the 
identity of Petrarch's Laura with the wife of 
Hugh de Sade, and that he makes the amazing 
misstatement that Carducci died last year. But 
in general, his book is of such a nature as to 
avoid controverted matters of fact, and is thus 
spared the attack of the scientific critic. To say 
that the book is readable is to do it much less 
than justice. 

The latest Dr. William J. Rolfe's new Life of 

life of Shakespeare (Estes) is not an in- 

Shakespeare. dispensable book. It contains no 
new material of importance, and almost no new 
inferences from the old. The author seldom pre- 
sents his own views of current Shakespearian 
questions except those that centre about the

[Jan. 16, 



Sonnets; and even the literary comments upon 
the plays, in which the book unnecessarily 
abounds, he quotes from easily accessible 
sources. This is the more to be deprecated 
because a Shakespearian student of Dr, Rolfe's 
experience must surely have opinions that 
are worth expressing. He cannot point out 
the 'Spenserian flavour' of 'The Lover's 
Complaint' except in the words of Verity and 
Malone (page 214), and he even spares himself 
the trouble of describing in his own language the 
Choruses of Henry V. (p. 243). The following, 
on 'Love's Labour's Lost,' fairly represents his 
method (p. 163) : 'It is "a play of conversation 
and situation" (Furnivall), in which "depth of 
characterization is subordinate to elegance and 
sprightliness of dialogue" (Staunton).' Nor are 
the quoted comments always chosen with judg- 
ment. Baynes's silly moralizing on the 'Bidford 
challenge' is quoted at length (pp. 102, 103) 
without comment, and two pages (pp. 229, 230) 
are given to Grant White's 'fine writing' on 
^ The Merchant of Venice. ' Five pages (pp. 264- 
268) of quotation and comment are devoted to the 
question whether the marriage of Benedick and 
Beatrice was happy. Indeed, the quotation from 
Hazlitt on 'Lear' (p. 413) may not unfairly be 
taken to express the biographer's mistaken con- 
ception of his task: 'We wish that we could 
pass this play over and say nothing about it. 
All that we can say must fall far short of the 
subject, or even of what we ourselves conceive 
of it; . . . yet we must say something.' 
There is an abundance of the profitless conjec- 
ture that few biographers of Shakespeare have 
had the good taste to avoid. Though the book 
was originally printed two years ago, the present 
reprint ought certainly to have been brought up 
to date. The author says (p. 235) of Morgann's 
■'Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John 
Falstaff' that it is 'unfortunately long out of 
print,' though it was reprinted in Nichol 
Smith's 'Eighteenth Century Essays on Shake- 
speare' early in the past year. Nor does he 
refer to Mr. Churton Collins 's admirable discus- 
sion of Shakespeare's classical scholarship in his 
recent 'Studies in Shakespeare,' ^ discussion 
that must henceforth be taken into consideration 
"by anyone who would treat Shakespeare's educa- 
tion and learning with intelligence. The illustra- 
tions of the book are entirely commonplace, and 
the index is incomplete. For the purpose for 
which it was first written, — to introduce a sub- 
scription edition of Shakespeare,— the biography 
is perhaps not useless; but its republication, with 
the volumes of Halliwell-Phillips and Sidney Lee 
accessible to everyone, seems to us quite unjusti- 
fied. 

A veteran Mr. Henry HajTiie, correspondent 

journalist's for many journals from many 
reminiscences. p^rtg of the world, but for the last 
twenty years a resident of Paris, tells us in his 
book of reminiscences entitled ' The Captains and 
the Kings' (Stokes), that during the period just 
mentioned he has written 'something like three 
thousand articles, or above six millions of words,' 
and that nearly every article was signed with 



his own name. 'To be anonymous in writing, 
whether private or public,' he declares, 'is fre- 
quently to be unfair if not cowardly.' Mr. Hay- 
nie's own style is frank and straightforward, 
with no suspicion of giving aught but the truth, 
except perhaps a slight tendency to convey an 
impression of intimacy with an incredible num- 
ber of celebrated persons. His pages are lavishly 
sprinkled with the names of eminent men and 
women, access to whom has been gained by this 
energetic, quick-witted, and resourceful journalist 
and interviewer. Possibly he himself helps to 
explain this when he openly acknowledges that 
'to be the chronicler of grand personages it is 
not necessary that one should have ever been on 
familiar terms with them, nor do we need to be 
very precise and exact as to their goings and 
comings in daily life.' But, with all the allow- 
ance this confession calls for, the book is to be 
commended. It is interesting from cover to 
cover; and, while it has chiefly to do with per- 
sons, is free from objectionable personalities. 
Mr. Haynie's long presidency of the Foreign 
Press Association of Corresi>ondents in Paris has 
brought him into contact with many persons one 
is glad to read about, especially those <^f his own 
calling. What he writes about the late M. de 
Blowitz is particularly worth reading. The 
author's amusing outbreak against 'that abomin- 
ation called grammar' gains point from his own 
occasional lapses from Addisonian English, as 
where he writes, 'On the return of my wife and 
I to America. . . .' Another slip, of a dif- 
ferent sort, occurs on the page facing Gladstone 's 
portrait, where he describes that statesman as 
clean-shaven, although the well-remembered gray 
whiskers are plainly visible in the picture. 
Thirty-two portraits and nine facsimiles of let- 
ters or parts of letters are given. 

Landmarks of The Scotch blood that appears from 
the Scottish his own words to have flowed in his 
umversities. veins should have made the 'Liter- 
ary Landmarks of the Scottish Universities' (Put- 
nam) a congenial theme to the late Laurence 
Hutton; but although this posthumous volume of 
our lamented author is graceful and entertaining, 
it is a compilation somewhat perfunctory in 
character and not beyond the capacity of almost 
any industrious hack-writer. With the exception 
of a personal letter from the Rev. James Sharp, 
the information collected appears to be drawn 
from the standard sources. Nevertheless the lit- 
tle book is at least a handy manual, and besides 
history and statistics it gives many a pleasant 
anecdote. Just why the author has assumed in 
his readers a less than elementary knowledge of 
English literature is not apparent. He stops to 
explain that James Boswell, who studied at Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow Universities, was 'the author 
of the Life of Samuel Johnson, an immortal book, 
and most assuredly a landmark in literature.' 
Furthermore, he says of Boswell that almost 
nothing is known of him,— and so we must try 
to be thankful for what he has here told us. 
After styling Bums 'a genius, but not altogether 
a gentleman,' he condescendingly characterizes 
Scott as 'a gentleman and almost a genius.' He

boggles unnecessarily at the term 'ninth jubilee'

Two or three attempts to be facetious are less 
happy than might have been wished. The por- 
traits and other illustrations are many and good; 
and they alone would almost suffice to make the 
book worth while. 

For the art Excepting Yasaii's, the only

bmiophxie. ^^l Michelangelo is 'that written 

by Ascanio Condi\'i, himself a painter and by 
repute a life-long member of the master's house- 
hold. Though this work has been given decided 
preference over Vasari's sketch by no less an 
authority than John Addington Symonds, it 
seems never to have appeared in satisfactory 
English translation. Now the deficiency is sup- 
plied by the scholarly and fluent rendering of 
Mr. Herbert P. Home, published in a limited 
edition by Mr. D. B. Updike at the Merrymount 
Press. Something more than a translator's share 
in the volume has been taken by Mr. Home, for 
the 'Montallegro' type here used for the first 
time is of his design, and he is resjwnsible also 
for the book's decorative features and general 
arrangement. The type is perhaps the most suc- 
cessful adaptation from the early Italian founts 
that has yet appeared; it is thoroughly simple 
and legible in character, with lines just hea\'j' 
enough to avoid any effect of weakness in the 
printed page. Though Mr. Ui>dike's typograph- 
ical tenets are usually sound, we can hardly 
subscribe to all of them. We realize that thiu 
spacing in Xyp^ composition is essential to the 
best artistic effect; but when it is carried so 
far as to interfere with readability, as is often 
the ease in the present volume, its virtue is de- 
cidedly open to question. The presswork shown 
in the book could hardly be improved upon, being 
delightfidly clear and even throughout, and the 
handmade paper used is excellent in quality. 
Altogether, the volume is one in which the biblio- 
phile no less than the art student will rejoice. 



•• \fith Stoddard Written with his usual troprical 
on a South luxuriance of style, Mr. Charles 

Seashore.' Warreu Stoddard's 'Island of 
Tranquil Delights' (Boston: Herbert B. Turner 
& Co.) is a little disappointing in its lack of sus- 
tained interest and convincing reality. Fact and 
fiction chase each other rather bewilderingly 
through his glowing pages, and the whole effect 
is vague and impressionistic. A California cir- 
cus story entitled 'A Sawdust Fairy,' in which 
the fairj-, when divested of tights and spangles, 
is a stimted little street gamin, is the only realis- 
tic chapter in the book. In most of the others 
we have glamour and charm and sensuous sug- 
gestion of things ineffable and delightful; but 
this prolonged riot of the imagination wearies the 
plain reader. Somewhat too imqualified are Mr. 
Stoddard's praises of the virtue that he finds 
accompanying the unclothed condition ; and some- 
what tiresomely frequent are his pictures of the 
sea-bathing natives of his beloved Otaheite. But 
his fondness for the gentle savage is sincere, and 
he is not unsuccessful in depicting his attractive 



qualities. The story of 'My Late Widow' per- 
plexes bj" its description of two separate and dis- 
similar deaths of apparently the same person, 
who is first drowned and then murdered. But 
perhaps all things are possible in the Island of 
Tranquil Delights. 

* The Musician 's Library, ' published 
miM^c^era. ^^ *^® Oliver Ditson Co., and beau- 

tifidly printed at the Merrymount 
Press, has just been enlarged by the addition of 
five new volumes. We have described the plan 
of this series in previous reviews; it is stifficient 
to say here that each volume has a special editor, 
who provides a critical or biographical introduc- 
tion and other helpful matter. Two of the five 
new volumes are devoted to lyrics by Ridiard 
Wagner (for tenor and soprano, respectively) 
and have been prepared by that veteran conduc- 
tor, performer, and teacher, Mr. Carl Armbruster. 
They give us (with German and English text) 
the most important lyrics of the music-dramas, 
from • Rienzi ' to ' Parsifal. ' The soprano volume 
has in addition the ' Trois Melodies ' of 1840 and 
the 'Fiinf Gedichte' of 1857 — the latter written 
fbr verses by Wagner's Egeria, Mathilde Wesen- 
donck. These volumes are in every way delight- 
ful. Two other volumes, edited by Mr. Philip 
Hale, are made up of songs by modern French 
eomjwsers, fifty in number, arranged alphabeti- 
cally from Bemberg to Widor. The editor's 
introduction is a thoroughly competent piece of 
critical work. Finally a volume containing ten 
of Liszt's 'Hungarian Rhapsodies' is edited by 
Messrs. August Spanuth and John Orth. They 
are the best known of the total nineteen, but no 
custom can stale their infinite variety. 



Two great The special winter number of the 

cartoonists 'International Studio' (John Lane) 
of France. jg devoted to the expositicm and 

illustration of the work of two great French 
cartoonists, Daumier and Gavami. Like many 
other modem French artists and draughtsmen, 
these two did most of their work for the illus- 
trated comic jotimals, a fact which doubtless 
accoimts in large measure for the small regard 
in which their names are held today. Critical 
and biographical notes on Daumier are translated 
from an essay by M. Henri Frantz, and M. Octave 
Uzanne writes of Gavami. Both essays are 
exceedingly interesting, not only in relation to 
the partictdar artists under discussion, but also 
as suggesting reflections about the whole class of 
modem art-work which is being poured out in 
vast quantities day by day, meant solely for the 
cheapest reproduction, and yet in many cases 
strong, original, expressive of salient phases of 
modem civilization, and deserving of more atten- 
tion than the mere laugh it provokes at the break- 
fast table. The essays are after all mere intro- 
ductions to the plates, which include one hundred 
and twenty reproductions in black and white, and 
twenty in color and photogravure. These illus- 
trate every phase of the artists' genius and 
emphasize their fertility and versatility— partic- 
idarly Gavami 's — of which the essays si>eak. 
Incidentally the cartoons furnish a fascinating

interpretation of Parisian life and manners. The 
si>ecial numbers of 'The Studio' are always inter- 
esting, but this one is unusually unique and sug- 
gestive. 

A handbook T^e title of a recent work by Prof. 
of Mentca Edward L. Thorndike, 'An Intro- 

statistics, duction to the Theory of Mental 

and Social Measurement' (New York: The 
Science Press), may cause an exclamation of sur- 
prise among the laity that such measurements 
are possible. Professor Thorndike 's book is 
intended entii-ely for the student, and for him 
it supplies a distinctly felt want. In psychology 
and sociology, groups of phenomena are fre- 
quently dealt with which express averages, rela- 
tions, variations, con-elations of sets of measure- 
ments, from the analysis of which important con- 
clusions are to be derived. There are well rec- 
ognized principles that determine the working 
up of such statistical material. These principles 
the student has had, until now, largely to learn 
incidentally by precept and example. Dr. Thorn- 
dike has provided an extremely practical and 
well-planned volume, that supplies the student 
with both the principle and the practice of the 
treatment of such relations as they occur in 
psychology and sociology. 

Observations It is difficult to estimate the good 
of an amateur that might result from Mr. Brough- 
immigrant. ^^^ Brandenburg's investigation of 

the immigration question, if his book on 
'Imported Americans.' (Stokes) should reach 
those in authority, or even those whose interest 
in the subject gives them influence in matters 
related to it. That the immigration question 
still remains an important national problem, in 
spite of all efforts made to solve it, is undisputed. 
The most earnest efforts to provide proper laws 
for the exclusion of undesirable aliens, with an 
efficient system for securing the enforcement of 
such laws, has resulted in little more than an 
evasion of them by the least desirable emigrants. 
Mr. Brandenburg traces the causes of this failure 
by an investigation as thorough and complete as 
it i)erhaps is possible to make. The two clos- 
ing chapters, on 'Legislation and Evasion' and 
'The Immigrant,' give a synopsis of what 
has been done and what might be done in the 
way of improving present conditions. After 
reading Mr. Brandenburg's book many will agree 
with him that the remedy for the evils complained 
of might best be effected through an immigration 
board in the immigrant's home-town. 



Tfte preservation The full record of the proceed- 
of contemporary ings of the Thirteenth Republican 
political records. National Convention, held at 
Chicago on June 21, 22, and 23, 1904, has been 
published in permanent form by the compiler, 
Mr. Charles W. Johnson (Minneapolis, Minn.), 
who was the General Secretary of the Conven- 
tion. The work is handsomely printed and bound, 
and is embellished with portraits of the principal 
officers of the convention and its nominees, and 
with sketches of the public careers of Messrs. 
Roosevelt and Fairbanks. The notable addresses 



which accompanied the nominations of these can- 
didates are here reproduced verbatim. Thus an 
exceedingly valuable contribution to the current 
political literature of the counti*y lias been made 
by the enthusiastic compiler. He has heretofore 
prepared and published in like permanent form 
the full recoi'ds of each of the twelve preceding 
national conventions of the same party. The 
whole series serves to perpetuate, in the precise 
language used in each convention, the history of a 
political party, in convenient foi-m for both pub- 
lic and private libraries; and within its limited 
field, it furnishes a faithful pen-picture of the 
discussions of the times. 

A beginnei-'s Miss Mary White, known tO' 
manual of workers in basketry for her 

pottery. ^^^ excellent manuals of direc- 

tions for beginners in that craft, has now 
written a book about pottery intended to- 
serve the same purpose. Like its predecessors, 
'How to Make Pottei-y' (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 
is a clear, simple, and thoroughly practical man- 
ual, and will doubtless help to popularize a handi- 
craft which is at present fascinating but very 
mysterious to most persons. Miss White begins 
with a description of the tools and materials 
needed, then tells how to work by hand and on 
the potter's wheel, and how to decorate and glaze 
the pots. She also explains the general princi- 
ple of the kiln. As in the basket books, there axe 
a number of excellent plates, ajid dii'ections tell 
exactly how to reproduce the objects illus- 
ti-ated. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



People who like riddles will find plenty of mate- 
rial on which to exercise their ingenuity in a 
small volume by Miss Florence L. Sahler, entitled 
'Captain Kidd and Other Charades' (Robert Grier 
Cooke). The fifty-three charades are in rhyme, and 
there is a key at the back of the book by means 
of which one may discover whether or not a cor- 
rect answer has been arrived at. A very interesting 
preface tells a little about the history of charades* 

This is the day of children, and it is surprising 
that nobody had written a book about that most 
fascinating child 'Pet Marjorie, ' until the centen- 
ary of her birth suggested the idea to Mr. L. Mac- 
bean. Of course, Dr. Brown's 'Marjorie Fleming* 
is the last, as it was almost the first, word about 
Marjorie, and it was a happy thought of Mr. Mac- 
bean or his publishers (Putnam) to incorporate this 
little classic in his volume. Mr. Macbean 's share 
of the work is devoted to a fuller description of 
Marjorie 's life and surroundings, and contains 
many characteristic extracts from her journal, a 
manuscript copy of which fortunately came to light 
while the book was in preparation. 

?The Secret of Popularity, or How to Achieve 
Social Success' (McClure, Phillips & Co.) is an 
attempt on the part of Miss Emily Holt, author of 
the 'Encyclopaedia of Etiquette,' to instruct the 
social non-entities, of whom the world is unfortu- 
nately so full, in the way to please. Miss Holt 
has apparently no hesitancy in assuming that a 
charming manner is as easily taught and acquired 
as good manners. She goes about her task with 
vigor, system,, and thoroughness, analyzing 'The

Messrs. Clifford & Lawton have published a port- 
folio entitled 'American Interior Decoration,' con- 
taining forty-five half-tone plates showing views 
of the best contemporary American interiors cor- 
rectly- classified by periods. The pictures present 
a considerable variety in style and aim, tending, 
however, to the older and standard forms rather 
than to the Arts and Crafts styles so popular at 
present. They do not, of course, reproduce detail 
or color, but they make clear the general scheme 
of work, and they are interesting as showing what 
is being accomplished by American decorators. 

'The Younger American Poets,' according to 
Miss Jessie B. Eittenhouse's book thus entitled, 
are eighteen in number, eleven of them being men. 
We have no particular fault to find with the selec- 
tion, since the one serious omission, that of Mr. 
Moody, is explained as due to copyright considera- 
tions. Certainly the eighteen writers discussed are 
deser\-ing of serious consideration, and Miss Kitten- 
house discourses upon their characteristics with 
intelligent appreciation. She gives us abundant 
illustrative extracts as well as criticism, and her 
book contains a series of portraits and a biographi- 
cal index. Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. are the

The journal of the National Educational Associa- 
tion for 1904 comes to us in the usual stout volume, 
this time having for a companion a year book with 
minutes, reports, and membership lists. The con- 
tents of the volume form a veritable encyclopaedia 
of current educational thought, and even the list 
of the more interesting papers is too long for us 
to print. It may be noted, however, that about 
forty of the papers have a special bearing upon 
the educational exhibit at St. Louis, where the 
meeting of last July was held, and that the num- 
ber of papers from foreign contributors is unusu- 
ally large. In the year book we have an account 
of the various special problems now in the hands 
of committees of investigation. 

Bayard Holmes, B.S., M.D., a well known author- 
ity, has prepared a book on 'Appendicitis and 
Other Diseases about the Appendix' (Appleton) 
which is almost in the nature of a popular work, 
so prevalent has the disturbance become since 
its definition in 1867. It is primarily addressed, of 
course, to students of medicine and surgery, and 
contains the necessary plates and directions for 
diagnosis and treatment. It scarcely need be said 
that Dr. Holmes believes emphatically in surgery 
as the only remedy applicable when the disease has 
manifested itself; and the notes of the cases that 
have come within his own knowledge prove that 
his apprehensions regarding delay are well founded. 
At the same time he goes far toward removing 
the fear of the surgeon's knife, so common every- 
where, by similar proof of his statement that ' Ideal 
appendicectomy ought not to require more than 
an inch-and-a-quarter incision, ten minutes of 
anaesthesia, and four days in the hospital.' No 
scar remains to mark the entrance of the surgeon's 
knife, and in most cases the subcutaneous injec- 
tion of a local anaesthetic suffices, it being needful 
to remain in bed on a light diet only one day there- 
after. The book contains an index and a brief 
bibliography, and is the first part of a larger work 
covering 'The Surgery of the Abdomen,' now in 
hand bv the author.

come to us from the Messrs. Brentano. 

'The Japanese Floral Calendar,' by Mr. Ernest 
W. Clement, is an interesting and beautifully illus- 
trated little volume just issued by the Open Court 
Publishing Co., the contents being reprinted from 
their monthly periodical, 'The Open Court.' 

'A Plea for the Historical Teaching of History,' 
by Mr. C. H. Firth, is published by the Oxford 
Clarendon Press. It gives us the author's inaugural 
lecture of a few weeks ago, when he assumed his 
new post of Regius Professor of Modem History at 
Oxford. 

Two recent publications of the University of 
Wisconsin are 'Das Sprichwort bei Hans Sachs,' 
by Mr. Charles Hart Handschin, and 'The King's 
Household in England before the Xorman Con- 
quest,' by Mr. Laurence Marcellus Larson. Both 
are in the form of doctoral dissertations. 

'The Government of Illinois,' by Mr. Evarts 
Bout ell Greene, is a new volume in the 'Hand- 
books of American Government, ' published by the 
Macmillan Co. The work is excellently done, and 
will earn the gratitude of teachers of civil gov- 
ernment throughout the schools of the State. 

Part n., completing the work, of Professor E. P. 
Cubberley's 'Syllabus of Lectures on the History 
of Education,' is sent us by the Macmillan Co. 
As in the earlier section of the work, the alternate 
pages are left blank for the insertion of new mat- 
ter, and the syllabus is accompanied by selected 
bibliographies and suggestions for reading. There 
are also many quaint and interesting illustrations 
from old books and prints. 

'A Parody Anthology,' collected by Miss Carolyn 
Wells, and published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons, is a book that includes many examples, new 
and old, of this form of literary diversion; and the 
average is surprisingly good. We are particularly 
glad to find here resuscitated the parodies written 
by Miss Phoebe Cary and those contained in 
Bayard Taylor's 'Diversions of the Echo Club.' 
The arrangement is by victims, and there are full 
indexes of titles, authors, and authors parodied. 

It is announced bv the Arthur H. Clark Co., pub- 
lishers of 'The Philippine Islands: 1493-1898,' 
which is being compiled and edited by Miss Emma 
Helen Blair and Mr. James Alexander Robertson, 
that Volume XXXII. and possibly a portion of Vol- 
ume XXXIII. of that series will contain the origi- 
nal Pigafetta relation of the Magellan expedition, 
with Sk page-for-page English translation. The 
Italian text is copied from the original manuscript 
in the Bibliotheca Ambrosiana, Milan, Italy, said 
to be the oldest Pigafetta manuscript in existence. 
All the peculiarities of the manuscript (which is 
written in the Venetian dialect of the early six- 
teenth century, with occasional French and Span- 
ish words) have been carefully preserved; and thus

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16. 



for the first time scholars who cannot have access 
to the original manuscript will be enabled to have 
before them the words of Pigafetta, as he wrote 
them. To those who are unable to read the nar- 
I'ative in the original, the English translation will 
be of the utmost service, while the copious annota- 
tions should prove helpful to all. 

The success of 'Country Life in America' has 
encouraged the publishers of that periodical, 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co., to project a new 
magazine devoted wholly to what has been but 
one of the interests covered in the older publica- 
tion. 'The Gardening Magazine,' as it is called, 
will be confined strictly to gardening subjects. The 
first number, dated February, will appear about the 
middle of the present month. 

'Eecreations of an Anthologist,' by Professor 
Brander Matthews, is a volume of pleasant literary 
essays published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
Among the titles are 'Unwritten Books,' 'Amer- 
ican Satires in Verse,' 'Carols of Cookery,' and 
' Recipes in Rhyme. ' A paper on the uncollected 
poems of H. C. Bunner is made particularly inter- 
esting by its presentation of several of the more 
broadly comic pieces of that versatile humorist. 

It has been known for some time past that the 
late Theodore Thomas was preparing for th,e pub- 
lic an autobiographical account of his career, under 
the editorial supervision of his life-long friend, 
Mr. George P. Upton. It had not been expected, 
however, that the work would be ready until next 
Fall; and it is a gratifying surprise to learn that 
it is so far advanced that the publishers, Messrs. 
A. C. MeClurg & Co., are able to promise its defi- 
nite appearance in April. This book, as already 
announced, is to be called 'Theodore Thomas: A 
Musical Autobiography,' and will consist of two 
large volumes — the first devoted to his life work, 
and the second almost entirely to programmes. It 
was Mr. Thomas's original intention to confine the 
autobiography to the musical events of his boy- 
hood and first public appearances, but as the work 
proceeded he became more and more interested, and 
made it complete by bringing it down to the pres- 
ent orchestral season. The same volume will also 
contain an appreciation by Mr, Upton of Mr. 
Thomas's life as a man and work as a musician 
and conductor, in which much additional informa- 
tion will be set forth. The second volume will 
contain all his representative and most significant 
programmes from 1855 to 1905, which may be called 
the period of his public career, carefully edited 
and explained when necessary. Mr. Thomas has 
added interest as well as authority to this volume 
by contributing a series of terse essays upon vari- 
ous musical subjects of interest to the general 
public hardly less than to the musician.

"4 volume which no serious

"Suggestive throughout, 
well considered and well

ARTHUR SYMONS writes

"H'Aof I hope Mr. Douglas's book, with all

chiefly do, is to bring, if not into popularity at

great critic who has so long been hidden away

in danger of being obscured by his own reputa-

Eden Phillpotts' New Novel The Secret Woman 

By the author of"' The American Prisoner,'' ''My Devon Year," " Children of the Mist," etc. Cloth, $1.50. 
A story whose interest is so concentrated that the reader is held from first to last by its dramatic intensity. The 
direct simplicity with which the depths of love and passion are laid bare gives it a tremendous power. And its 
atmosphere is such as no other novelist now creates : — the story opens in the light and fragrance of young May in 
the heart of Devon woods, and closes in the glorious majesty of a Christmas dawn on Dartmoor. 

By the same Author : The American Prisoner illustrated. Cloth, $1.50. 
" Is a strong and interesting story, much the best in several ways that Phillpotts has written." — Cleveland Leader.

MODERN LIBRARY WORK: ITS AIMS 
AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS. 

AS SUOOBSTSD BT THB ST. liOUIS COKFKBSNCB Or 
THS AMKBICAK I.IBRABT ASSOCIATION. 



The work of the recent St. Louis conference 
of the American Library Association perhaps 
does not form so good a basis for a general 
smmning up of the aims and achievements of 
modem library work in America as might some 
of the previous conferences; but as strongly 
emphasizing many of the highest of these aims 
and tendencies, it was unequalled in the annals 
of the Association. It was intended, as Presi- 
dent Putnam said in his opening address, to 
deal at this meeting with the larger phases of 
the library movement; to the neglect, if neces- 
sary, of the customary discussions of practical 
detail. The cosmopolitan character of the 
attendance and the scientific elevation of the 
themes gave to all the work a character that 
fairly represents the increasing breadth and 
deration of modem library aims in generaL 

One of the chief ideals of modem library 
work, as of all economic and social life, is 
cooperation. 'No bibliothecal body has ever 
emphasized and developed this fundamental 
social aim as has the American Library Associ- 
ation, — not forgetting the work of the Boyal 
Society or the Institut de Bibliographic. Its 
achievements in this line are well known, — the 
Poole's Index and its successors and imitators; 
the standardization of methods in cataloguing, 
and in cards and other materials; the adoption 
of the metrical system of measurements; the 
publication of catalogue cards, cooperative lists 
of periodicals, the 'A.L.A.' Catalogue, and so on. 
The St. Louis conference showed much coopera- 
tive work, of one sort or another, being done in 
Prussia, Sweden, Xorway, Switzerland, Austria, 
Belgium, France, and Great Britain; and the 
cosmopolitan character of modem library aims 
was illustrated by such results of cooperation 
on an international scale as the International 
Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Ziirich 
Index, and the work of the Institut de Bibli- 
ographic, by the proposals to extend interna- 
tional catalogues to oflBcial literature, historical 
periodicals, and manuscripts, and by the Hand- 
book of Learned Societies. It took concrete 
form in two proposals for organized interna- 
tional cooperation, on both of which special 
committees were appointed: Mr. Jasfs propo- 
sition from the Library A^ociation of the 
United Kingdom for cooperation with the

' A. L. A/ in establishing uniform cataloguing 
rules, and the suggestion of President Putnam 
and President Francis for the afl&liation of the 
library associations of Europe and America. 

The most significant recent result of cooper- 
ation is undoubtedly the published catalogue 
card, as developed especially by the Library of 
Congress, the John Crerar Library, and the 
Publishing Board of the * A. L. A.' Librarians 
are no longer tolerant of the economic waste of 
expending over and over again the expert work 
required in cataloguing, and the mechanical 
work in reduplicating cards by manuscript. The 
present aim is to relegate manuscript work in 
cataloguing to the same position now occupied 
by manuscript processes in the production of 
books. Two indications of aim and achieve- 
ment in this field are Mr. Lane's proposal of 
cooperation to supplement existing card publi- 
cation, and the announcement that printed 
cards for all the titles in the new 'A. L. A.' 
Catalogue would be distributed by the Library 
of Congress. The significance of this latter 
plan lies in the fact that it affords a method 
of utilizing card publication by the small 
library, whereas this system has hitherto been 
chiefly of advantage to the large libraries. 

Another more or less distinctively modem 
aim of American library workers is to encour- 
age scientific bibliography — that most impor- 
tant aid to the librarian's work. This idea was 
indicated at the St. Louis conference by the 
formation in connection with the meeting of 
the Association, and largely from among its 
members, of the American Bibliographical Soci- 
ety. The membership and officers of this new 
organization are such as point most encourag- 
ingly to marked results in the bibliographical 
field. 

One of the most significant movements in 
modern scientific library administration in 
America was represented at St. Louis in the 
meeting of the state librarians. When the * A. 
L. A.' was formed, and for ten years afterward, 
there were hardly half a dozen librarians in 
America to whom the word 'archive' meant 
anything practical. Today archival science is 
developed to a high degree in many states. To 
the careful observer of library progress there 
are few achievements in American library work 
so valuable in themselves and so promising of 
future scientific usefulness as that of which 
Mr. Owen's work in Alabama is perhaps the 
best type, but which is now being done in many 
states. 

Perhaps, after all, most of the indications 
of achievement brought out at the St. Louis 
meeting might be grouped as efforts tending to 
promote the familiar triple aim, ' the best read- 
ing, for the largest number, at the least cost.' 



The aim to secure the best reading was typically 
illustrated by the 'A. L. A.' Catalogue, dis- 
tributed at this time. The modern library idea 
is to guide the reader, and especially to guide 
the librarian who is to guide the reader, to the 
best literature. To this end there are now 
many publications issued each year intended 
to aid in the selection of books, but the new 
' A. L. A.' Catalogue, whatever may be said in 
criticism of its details, stands as the type and 
personification of the spirit of helpfulness in 
selection that is one of the definite aims of 
modem library work. Other straws pointing in 
the same direction were the appointment of a 
committee to cooperate with Mr. Thompson in 
the preparation of his work on fiction, and 
in the demand of the library commissions for 
special select lists to be used in their work. 

In its efforts to serve the ' largest number,' 
modern library work has taken on an immense 
number of secondary aims and activities, many 
of which were in evidence at St. Louis. The 
modem aspect of this general aim may be said 
to be this : to educate continuously every mem- 
ber of the community. This purpose takes the 
special form of (1) cooperation with the work 
of the schools, and (2) continuing the work of 
the school from the point where the school 
lays it down, and carrying it to the end of life. 
This has become one of the most generally 
recognized aims, and has been the inspiration 
of much of the best and most aggressive work 
in the popular library field. It was mentioned 
by Mr. Dewey, the most untiring promoter of 
the conception, and was implied by the work 
of the library commissions. 

Another modem aspect of this aim to serve 
the largest number was illustrated by the spe- 
cial exhibit at St. Louis of the Pennsylvania 
Free Circulating Library for the Blind. This 
exhibit is a type of the tendency to provide for 
the special needs of every worthy class in the 
community, and makes evident the remarkable 
progress in recent years in the provision for 
this particular class by the public libraries. 

The purpose to provide for every class and 
condition of men has its counterpart in a grow- 
ing tendency to provide all sorts and conditions 
of things for all. Musical scores are now sup- 
plied in many libraries, and Mr. Dewey's 
address on the limits of state aid advocated the 
purchase of pictures, lantern-slides, perforated 
rolls for mechanical music, etc. While this idea 
opened the way to some pleasantries about 
' enriching the repertory of the organ-grinder,' 
and a pretended fear that the principle would 
lead to rivalry with the pawn-shop, it repre- 
sented a recognized aim to serve every man's 
peculiar intellectual need through the medium 
of the library. 



1905] 



THE DIAL. 



76 



Still another aspect of this aim to serve the 
many may be found in the so-called missionarj- 
work of pushing out the library frontiers by 
the founding of new collections. This mission- 
ary spirit in modem library work permeates 
radically the whole atmosphere; modern libra- 
rians are irrepressible expansionists. The best 
result of this spirit is shown in the work of the 
state library commissions. A league of these 
commissions was formed at this conference and 
active steps are being taken to promote its 
work. The same spirit was also especially indi- 
cated at St. Louis by the decision to hold the 
Association's next annual meeting at Portland, 
for the avowed purpose of doing what could 
be done to promote the extension of libraries in 
the Northwest. 

Another indication of this same general aim 
of serving the largest number may be seen in 
the extension of their service rendered by the 
already established libraries. To this aspect 
belongs what is known as ' library extension/ in 
its narrower sense, — library lectures and 
devices intended to encourage the use of libra- 
ries or to extend their field of influence in the 
community. Mr. Jast's paper was something of 
a revelation to many of the greater results 
accomplished in this direction by British as 
compared with American libraries. 

Connected with this improvement in the use 
of present facilities is the matter of the inter- 
library loan. The progress made in this direc- 
tion of supplementing the facilities of libraries 
by lending to one another was clearly brought 
forth at St. Louis; but more clearly still was 
brought out the fact of the inferiority as yet in 
this regard of American achievement to Euro- 
pean. However, the very knowledge of such 
inferiority establishes a stimulus, and it may 
be said that one of the most definite aims 
brought out by this conference is the extension 
of the inter-library loan. This in turn brought 
forth what may be called a sub-aim, — the 
determination to secure, if practicable, some 
reform in the rates of postage for library books 
necessary before the inter-library loan system 
can be properly developed. 

Perhaps one of the most suggestive indica- 
tions as to the tendency in library expansion 
was the discussion of the conference over the 
limits of state aid, and similar questions raised 
at the meetings of the state librarians and the 
state library commissions. There is a signifi- 
cant growth in the tendency to apply to the 
fostering of library interests in the state the 
same principles that have been applied to its 
schools ; and state commissions, travelling libra- 
ries, travelling librarians, grants, and other 
fostering aids are being more and more freely 
extended, and are resulting in very remarkable 



success in the way of serving the greatest 
number. 

The problem of how to secure at the least 
cost all the worthy objects touched upon in the 
foregoing statements is one that gives the mod- 
em library worker a great deal of concern. 
Low cost to the individual user must, in the 
last analysis, be inseparable from economy of 
administration. It is true that profuseness of 
state or municipal aid does not involve any 
direct expense to the non-tax-paying reader, 
who is perhaps in the majority. But such pro- 
fuseness, if not economically administered, 
means for the individual user so much less 
advantage; or, in short, it increases the cost to 
him of what advantages he does enjoy. At any 
event, economy in purchase and economy in 
administration are two very live problems of 
modern library work. The matter of economy 
in purchase was represented at St. Louis by the 
remarkably interesting report of the committee 
on relations with the book trade, concerning eco- 
nomical methods of purchase and especially the 
matter of increased cost of books to libraries 
under the present net price system of book 
publishing. 

To the subject of economy belongs also the 
remarkable growth of organization in library 
administration. Attention was directed to this, 
first of all, by the fact that the Librarian of 
Congress was the President of the conference; 
then by the fact that many of the ablest partici- 
pants in the conference were heads of depart- 
ments of one or another of the great libraries; 
then by the fact, emphasized by President Put- 
nam in his address, that there are now fifty- 
nine libraries in America having over 300,000 
volumes each ; and, finally, by the facts brought 
out in the report on gifts regarding the Carnegie 
branch libraries, especially those in New York 
and Philadelphia. The marked development of 
the great libraries and the multiplication of 
their activities have demanded a corresponding 
development of their organization. Subdivision 
of labor, the analysis and coordination of dif- 
ferent functions in different departments, — in 
short, all the matters belonging to the economi- 
cal administration of a great business, have 
had earnest attention and show striking results. 
Without any depreciation of the work of the 
great public municipal libraries which have 
shown such expansion and development of 
organization in their branch systems, or the 
work of such libraries as the State Library at 
Albany, the John Crerar Library, the Columbia 
University Library, and others, it will not be 
invidious to say that the Library of Congress 
offers an example of concrete achievement in the 
way of multiplied activities, well organized on 
economical lines and producing practical results.

[Feb. 1, 



that is probably unequalled in the modern 
library world, except by the work of Panizzi. 
Yet it is fair to say, too, that this spirit of 
practical business organization is also produc- 
ing among many of the smaller libraries some 
most interesting results in the way of sharp 
organization and economy through subordina- 
tion of function — that primary aspect of eco- 
nomical administration by which the more 
highly paid is not allowed to do the work of 
the less highly paid. The removal of this lat- 
ter standing reproach against the old-fashioned 
organization is closely connected with the ques- 
tion of skilled labor, and the library schools have 
greatly helped in developing both theory and 
application by tending to draw the line between 
skilled and unskilled labor. It may be noted in 
this connection that the multiplication of 
branch libraries and distributing stations 
reduces the cost to the individual user by saving 
him time and money in getting at the books. 

Any account of the aims and achievements 
of American libraries as suggested by the St. 
Louis conference would be incomplete without 
reference to the fact, brought out in the meet- 
ing by President Putnam, that at the time of 
the Louisiana Purchase America had but one 
hundred libraries, with 50,000 volumes; 
whereas today she has 10,000 libraries, with 
more than 50,000,000 volumes. This in itself 
is a splendid record of achievement, but it is 
not the end. It is a primary aim of American 
libraries collectively to have at least one copy 
of every book needed for serious use in this 
country. Assuming that 5,000,000 of the best 
forei^ books form the ultimate basis, it is true 
that probably half of this number may be found 
in American libraries; and ninety per cent, of 
the remainder are easily obtainable, either in the 
originals or in fac-simile reproduction. This 
particular development of our American libra- 
ries is an aim second only to the vital prac- 
tical purpose of serving the life-long education 
of the average citizen. The splendid contribu- 
tions now made by municipal, state, and 
national authorities, supplemented by remark- 
able gifts from private sources (shown in the 
St. Louis report to amount to more than 
$6,000,000 and 137,000 volumes during the 
previous year), is producing a record of results 
on both counts of which we may well be proud. 
But there is still much to do, and one of the 
chief aims of modem library work must be to 
make the consciousness of the necessity of 
library work for the education of the mass of 
the people and the progress of the higher civili- 
zation so vivid and ever present that means for 
essential development of all varied activities 
may be multiplied.

BIBLIOGRAPHY IN AMERICA. 



Bibliography begins to be cultivated only 
after many other literary and scientific studies 
are already well established. It depends upon 
the existence of large collections of books in 
which its facts may be industriously gathered; 
it is seldom pursued for pecuniary profit; it 
implies a certain leisure on the part of well- 
informed persons who, not having the spark 
of genius that kindles original production, are 
content to review what others have done and 
have the skill to record it in systematic ways 
and make it useful to those who, basing their 
work on facts already established, c'arry forward 
the outposts of discovery. 

Another task that engages the bibliographer 
is the unravelling of some of the perplexities 
that beset the history of human progress, where, 
because of the failure of the ordinary records, 
the succession of events or the relations of 
cause and effect have to be painfully determined 
by out-of-the-way investigations and by infer- 
ences drawn from sources where the less- 
instructed reader would not expect to find help, 
until at last the truth comes out with new dis- 
tinctness. Such is the work of the historical 
bibliographer, especially in everything that 
connects itself with the history of the book, 
printed or manuscript, and upon his help the 
historian proper must often depend. 

A humbler service, but a most useful one, is 
that of the commonplace bibliographer, the 
practical librarian whose time and strength are 
given to answering the every-d'ay questions 
which the readers in his library ask. If he 
has the happy faculty of quickly taking the 
point of view of the inquirer, and the instinct 
that tells him where to direct his search, he 
accumulates a store of practical bibliographical 
information which may become liighly valua- 
ble, and if he does his work systemati- 
cally he is prepared to serve the cause of 
bibliography by shaping his material into num- 
berless hand-lists and reading guides such as 
every library bulletin is glad to print. 

All these varieties of bibliographical activ- 
ity, — the record of production, the historical 
study, and the popular guide, — have begun to 
flourish on American soil. Careful and 
thorough work has been carried on in each field, 
and in paths that lead from one field to another, 
and favorable conditions have not been lacking. 
Considering the fact that bibliographical 
studies are relatively young with us, it is 
remarkable how little work of a slipshod char- 
acter has been put forth and how much work, 
undertaken on an elaborate scale and depending 
for its value on great accuracy and complete- 
ness, is already under way. 

The practical bibliography, also, — not .the

dreary list of mere titles that simply appals the 
inquirer, but the well-digested guide, illumi- 
nated by every appropriate device of classifica- 
tion, annotation, and selection, that forms a gen- 
uine help to the student, starting him straight, 
directing his steps, giving him useful clues, 
and saving him from pitfalls, — this kindly, 
serviceable, informal bibliography appears now 
and then, and is as welcome as a wdl-informed 
and keen-eyed friend. Justin Winsor's * Read- 
er's Handbook of the American Eevolution,' 
Adams's 'Manual of Historical Literature,' 
Charming and Harf s ' Guide to the Study of 
American History,' Gross's * Bibliography of 
British Municipal History,' Bowker and Iles's 
'Reader's Guide in Economic, Social, and 
Political Science,' — these are good examples. 
The annotated bibliographies issued by the; 
American Library A^ociation on fine arts 
and music, on American history, on children s 
books, and on reference books have the same 
practical end in view, and have been found act- 
ually serviceable. 

Among the more elaborate bibliographical 
enterprises of the day are the ' International 
Catalogue of Scientific Literature,' to which the 
United States contributes its share through the 
Smithsonian Institution; the catalogue of the 
Library of Congress, printed in card form so 
that it may be duplicated and maintained com- 
plete in twenty-five depositor}' libraries, and so 
that every library' may incorporate into its own 
catalogue whatever separate titles it can use; 
the catalogue of the Surgeon General's Library 
in Washington, practically a great classified 
bibliography of medicine and the most exten- 
sive in existence, stretching out already to 
twenty-five quarto volumes and containing a 
million and a quarter entries; the 'Index 
Medicus,' a classified index to current medical 
periodicals and publications, begun in 1879 and 
continued down to June, 1899, when the great 
expense of the work compelled its suspension, 
but renewed in 1903 with the help of the Car- 
negie Institution; various bibliographies pub- 
lished in card form, covering zoology (103,000 
titles to January 1, 1904, published in Zurich, 
but American in its plan and administration), 
botany (8,000 titles, issued by the Torrey 
Botanical Club), new American botanical spe^ 
cies (30,000 titles, prepared at first by Miss 
Day of the Gray Herbarium, Cambridge, and 
now by Miss Clark of the Department of Agri- 
culture), agriculture (2,800 titles, issued by the 
same department), the contents of 250 current 
learned periodicals (21,000 titles, printed under 
the care of the Publishing Board of the Amer- 
ican Library Association), and, to mention one 
older work, Sabin's ' Dictionary of Books relat- 
ing to America,' a monument of patient labor. 



suspended in the midst of the letter * S ' in 1891, 
but with a prospect of continuation in the 
near future. Excellent bibliographical work 
of another kind has been done by various print- 
ing clubs in republishing rare books and in issu- 
ing careful monographs on the history of the 
printed book in its various aspects. 

Shorter contributions of an historico-bibli- 
ographical nature found for a brief period a 
medium for publication in ' The Bibliographer,' 
edited during the first five months of its exist- 
ence (January to May, 1902), by Paul Leices- 
ter Ford, and continued after his death by the 
publishers, Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., until 
June, 1903. Articles of a bibliographical char- 
acter occasionally appear in the library jour- 
nals, or in the literary and historical periodi- 
cals; but in general the former journals con- 
cern themselves almost exclusively with mat- 
ters of library administration, and the latter 
hold that strictly bibliographical contributions 
interest but a limited number of their readers. 
What shall be the task of the new Biblio- 
graphical Society of America? What kind of 
bibliographical work shall it take up, and in 
what way can it be most helpful to the progress 
of American bibliography? It has no endow- 
ment and cannot expect to have one, at least 
until it has proved its usefulness and shown 
that it can be trusted to administer its affairs 
wisely. Depending upon the yearly fees of its 
members, it cannot take up great projects 
requiring generous and continued support, such 
as only governments or endowments can afford. 
Such projects, however, may for the present be 
safely trusted to the Carnegie Institution, to 
the Library of Congress (if its present liberal 
and enlightened policy continues to receive the 
support of Congress) , and to some of the larger 
societies, such as the American Historical 
Association. 

Bibliography of a popular kind, — the current 
recommendation of good books, the preparation 
of reading lists on current topics, and the com- 
pilation of more extensive works, if their prin- 
cipal field of usefulness is in public libraries, 
may be left to the larger libraries, to some of 
the library commissions, and especially to the 
Publishing Board of the American Library 
Association, which enjovs the use of a fund of 
$100,000, estabHshed by Mr. Carnegie, the 
income of which is to be applied primarily to 
the prosecution of just such work. 

To edit a good journal of bibliography, — 
one which should be a medium for the publica- 
tion of articles in the field of historical and 
descriptive bibliography, should keep its read- 
ers informed of work in progress and preserve a 
record of work published elsewhere, and should 
gather up the news in regard to books, new and

old, which book-lovers want to know, — such 
would be a useful task not at present performed 
by any other agency in America, and it is to be 
hoped that the new Society may be able to take 
up this function and discharge it successfully. 
Such an enterprise, however, cannot be entered 
upon unadvisedly, and the Society must be 
assured that material of an interesting charac- 
ter exists in sufficient abundance, that contribu- 
tors who have the time and inclination to put 
it into shape are ready to do so, and that read- 
era will be willing to support such a periodical 
by their subscriptions. 

There is other appropriate work, also, for 
the Society to take up, such as the publication 
of certain useful bibliographical records or com- 
pilations which depend upon material to be 
found in different places and which can there- 
fore best be prepared by cooperation. One such 
catalogue has been announced as its first publi- 
cation, — a ' List of Incunabula in American 
libraries/ Other publications of a similar 
character suggested to the Council of the Soci- 
ety include a list of early manuscripts in 
American libraries; a list of special collections 
in American libraries, designed to show inquir- 
ers where material relating to their special 
studies can best be found, and indicating the 
character of the material accessible; a classified 
list of current bibliographical records, includ- 
ing not only journals which make bibliographi- 
cal records their principal aim, but also those 
which regularly contain, in addition to other 
matter, reviews, lists, or notices of works on 
particular subjects. 

Other possibilities of larger scope lie hazily 
in the distance, — such as a comprehensive 
bibliography of all American publications; a 
bibliography of bibliographies on a more com- 
plete and extended scale than has been 
attempted before; a list of periodicals accessi- 
ble in American libraries; and other similar 
dreams that the enthusiastic bibliographer often 
revels in. But these all belong to a later stage 
in the Society's history, if they are to come 
into its history at all, for they demand wide 
cooperation and the maintenance of a strong 
staff of paid workers. 

Whatever the Society undertakes to do, it is 
evident that it should strive to make its mem- 
bership desirable to all classes of book lovers, — 
book makers (authors and publishers), book 
sellers, book distributors (librarians), book 
collectors, and book readers. It hopes to become 
a common meeting place for all these interests, 
and to find the means to perform some useful 
service in which many will cooperate and which 
will be acceptable to all.

Theodore Watts-Dunton.* 

Kossetti once said of Mr. Watts-Dunton that 
he ' had sought obscurity as other poets seek 
fame.' There may be a trifling exaggeration in 
the statement, but it is certainly true that this 
distinguished man of letters has been careless 
of his reputation, has left it to shift for itself, 
and has never resorted to anything like self- 
advertisement. He has even neglected the pre- 
cautions that most writers take naturally and 
as a matter of course for the permanent pres- 
ervation of their work, and has throughout hij 
career remained indifferent to the applause of 
the larger public. Thus it came about that 
' Aylwin ' was withheld from publication for 
many years after it was written, that the poems 
were widely scattered in print — or even lent in 
manuscript f oitai to friends, and lost — but not 
collected into a volume until a comparatively 
recent date, and that the great mass of the 
critical writings must still be sought in the 
files of the periodicals to which they were first 
contributed. This condition of things, a cause 
of deep regi-et to those of us who long 
ago learned to honor the name of Theodore 
Watts, was remedied in part some six or seven 
years ago by the publication of ' Aylwin ' and 
'The Coming of Love,' and some further rem- 
edy is now offered by the volume which serves 
as the subject of the present review, and which 
has been prepared with the consent of Mr. 
Watts-Dunton by one of his younger friends. 

The object of Mr. Douglas in this work is to 
give a general view of the man and his writings. 
As far as the man is concerned, the work is by 
no means a formal biography, but rather a 
series of dissolving views of a strong personal- 
ity, illustrative of his wide interests, his varied 
scholarly acquirements, the keenness and sym- 
pathy of his critical temper, and the genius for 
friendship which has brought to him richer 
rewards than fall to the lot of many men of 
letters, however fortunately they may be cir- 
cumstanced. As far as the writings are con- 
cerned, Mr. Douglas leaves them to speak for 
themselves, for something like two-thirds of his 
book is occupied with reprinted essays and 
poems, or fragmentary illustrations of the 
longer compositions. His own commentary is 
rambling and possibly overwrought, but will be 
found serviceable as a sort of connective tissue 
whereby the reprinted passages are held to- 
gether, or as a sort of transparent jelly in 
which they are embedded. We could have

spared the extracts from ' Aylwin ' and ' The 
Coming of Love,' since those books are now 
within everybody's reach, but we are heartily 
grateful for the reprinted criticism, since that 
has been hitherto practically inaccessible. As 
the purpose of the work was to represent its 
subject in his triune character of critic, poet, 
and writer of imaginative prose, all three 
species of composition had to be included in 
something like equal measure, but it is for the 
critical writing alone that the volume is really 
to be treasured. 

Even in this character, we are bound to 
regard it as a makeshift. The writer whom 
Mr. Swinburne has called 'the first critic of 
our time, perhaps the largest-minded and surest- 
sighted of any age,' is not to be preserved for 
posterity by any collection of extracts; nothing 
less than his entire work will satisfy the stu- 
dent and lover of literature. No matter if it 
* would fill several folio volumes,' it is too pre- 
cious to be lost, and too uniformly weighty to 
be sifted. It is fundamental criticism, of the 
t3rpe which Coleridge has hitherto chiefly rep- 
resented in our literature, and it has an insight 
equal to that of Coleridge, besides resting upon 
a basis of knowledge broader than was possessed 
by the older critic, with all his excursions into 
strange poetical and philosophical realms. It 
must all be brought together at some time, and 
if its author is unwilling to do us this final 
service, it must be done for us (and for him) 
by another hand. 

As a student of the poetry of his and our 
own time, Mr. Watts-Dunton has seen clearly 
that a new spirit has come over the most refined 
contemporary thought as exercised in imagina- 
tive directions, and this manifestation he has 
happily named ' The Renascence of Wonder.' 
We are not sure that this is * the greatest phil- 
osophical generalization of our time,' as Mr. 
Douglas seems to think it, but it is a felicitous 
phrase, in any event, and makes a text for a 
singularly penetrative piece of critical writing. 
A special introduction to one of the later edi- 
tions of ' Aylwin ' first introduced the words to 
the public. 

'The phrase, the Renascence of Wonder, merely 
indicates that there are tvro great impulses gov- 
erning man, and probably not man only, but the 
entire world of conscious life: the impulse of 
acceptance — the impulse to take unchallenged and 
for granted all the phenomena of the outer world 
as they are — and the impulse to confront these 
phenomena with eyes of inquiry and wonder.' 

In the noteworthy essay contributed to the 
new edition of Chambers's * Cyclopaedia of Eng- 
lish Literature, ' this principle is carefully elab- 
orated. 

'It would seem that something works as inevi- 
tably and as logically as a physical law in the 
yearning which societies in a certain stage of devel- 



opment show to get away, as far as possible, from 
the condition of the natural man; to get away from 
that despised condition not only in material affairs, 
such as dress, domestic arrangements and econ- 
omies, but also in the fine arts and in intellectual 
methods, till, having passed that inevitable stage, 
each society is liable to suffer (even if it does not 
in some cases actually suffer) a reaction, when 
nature and art are likely again to take the place 
of convention and artifice.' 
Speaking of the sense of wonder that came 
into English literature with the Elizabethan 
eclosion, the author goes on to say: 

'It is that kind of wonder which filled the souls 
of Spenser, of Marlowe, of Shakespeare, of Webster, 
of Ford, of Cyril Toumeur, and of the old ballads: 
it is that poetical attitude which the human mind 
assumes when confronting those unseen powers of 
the universe who, if they did not weave the web 
in which man finds himself entangled, dominate it.' 

Twice since the * spacious times' of which 
these words are written has the same sort of 
reaction from reality been witnessed in our lit- 
erature : a hundred years ago we called it the 
romantic revival; in our own time Mr. Watts- 
Dunton calls it the renascence of wonder. It 
seems to be the same thing over again, although 
in its latest appearance it assumes a more reg- 
ulated form, and its vagabond tendencies are 
more strictly restrained by the greater amount 
of exact knowledge at our command. 

When in the mood of romance or of wonder, 
whichever we may call it, the spirit tries to get 
away, not only from reality of the barren prac- 
tical sort, but also from seli-consciousness. Mr. 
Watts-Dunton brings out this fact very strik- 
ingly when he contrasts the genuine with the 
sophisticated type of nature-worship. 

'How hateful is the word "experience" in the 
mouth of the litterateurs. They all seem to think 
that this universe exists to educate them, and that 
they should write books about it. They never look 
on a sunrise without thinking what an experience 
it is; how it is educating them for bookmaking. 
It is this that so often turns the true Nature- 
worshipper away from books altogether, that makes 
him bless with what at times seems such malicious 
fervour those two great benefactors of the human 
race. Caliph Omar and Warburton's cook.' 

The impulse which led to the writing of 
these lines is that which forced the writer to 
reject, with sure instinct, Arnold's famous 
definition of poetry as a ' criticism of life.' The 
truth of the matter is that poetry is not life 
criticised but life expressed, with intensity and 
clarity, and that just so far as poetry becomes 
criticism it ceases to do its proper office. Closely 
allied with this repudiation is that of ' the mod- 
em Carlylean heresy of work,' concerning 
which we read : 

'It is not a little singular that this heresy of the 
sacredness of work should be most flourishing at 
the very time when the sophism on which it was 
originally built is exploded; the sophism, we mean, 
that Nature herself is the result of Work, whereas 
she is the result of growth. One would have thought 



80 



THE DIAL, 



[Feb. 1, 



that this was the very time for recognizing what 
the sophism has blinded us to, that Nature's per- 
manent temper — whatever may be said of this or 
that mood of hers — is. the temper of Sport, that her 
pet abhorrence, which is said to be a vacuum, is 
really Work. We see this clearly enough in what 
are called the lower animals — whether it be a tiger 
or a gazelle, a ferret or a coney, a bat or a butter- 
fly — the final cause of the existence of every 
conscious thing is that it should sport. For this 
end it was that "the great Vishnu yearned to 
create a world." Yet over the toiling and moiling 
world sits Moloch Work, while those whose hearts 
are withering up with hatred of him are told by 
certain writers to fall down before him and pre- 
tend to love.' 

One of the most eloquent of the essays here 
reproduced for us by Mr. Douglas has for its 
subject the Bible, and more particularly the 
Book of Psalms, and was published as long ago 
as 1877 in ' The Athenaeum.' From this essay 
we wish to make several quotations. 

' A great living savant has characterized the Bible 
as " a collection of the rude imaginings of Syria, ' ' 
"the worn-out old bottle of Judaism into which 
the generous new wine of science is being poured. ' ' 
The great savant was angry when he said so. The 
"new wine" of science is a generous vintage, 
undoubtedly, and deserves all the respect it gets 
from us; so do those who make it and serve it out; 
they have so much intelligence; they are so honest 
and so fearless. But whatever may become of their 
wine in a few years, when the wine-dealers shall 
have passed away, when the savant is forgotten as 
any star-gazer of Chaldaea, — the "old bottle" is 
going to be older yet, — the Bible is going to be 
eternal. For that which decides the vitality of any 
book is precisely that which decides the value of 
any human soul — not the knowledge it contains, 
but simply the attitude it assumes towards the uni- 
verse, unseen as well as seen. The attitude of the 
Bible is just that which every soul must, in its 
highest and truest moods, always assume — that of 
a wise wonder in front of such a universe as this 
— that of a noble humility before a God such as He 
"in whose great Hand we stand." ' 

And the secret of the English Bible is that 
it is written in the Great Style, which, 
' Both in literature and in life, is unconscious 
power and unconscious grace in one. . . . Out 
of the twenty-three thousand and more verses into 
which the Bible has been divided, no one can find a 
vulgar verse; for the Great Style allows the stylist 
to touch upon any subject with no risk of defile- 
ment. That is why style in literature is virtue. 
To reproduce the Great Style of the original in a 
Western idiom, the happiest combination of cir- 
cumstances was necessary. . . . That noble 
heroism — bom of faith in God and belief in the 
high duties of man — which we have lost for the 
hour — was in the very atmosphere that hung over 
the island. And style in real life, which now, as a 
consequence of our loss, does not exist at all among 
Englishmen, and only among a very few English 
women — having given place in all classes to man- 
ner — flourished then in all its charm. And in lit- 
erature it was the same: not even the euphuism im- 
ported from Spain could really destroy or even 
seriously damage the then national sense of style.' 

These extracts from a remarkable essay must 
suffice, although it is hard to refrain from quot- 
ing also what is said of the contrast between 



the Psalms in the Authorized Version, and their 
doggerellized perversion by Hopkins and Stern- 
hold, Tate and Brady. For the ' Hopkins ele- 
ment' must be taken into account by all who 
would understand the English character. 

'When St. Augustine landed here with David he 
found not only Odin, but Hopkins, a heathen then 
in possession of the soil.' 

Leaving these serious matters, we will now 
devote what little space remains us to such bits 
of anecdote as may seem best to illustrate the 
lighter side of this absorbing book. Professor 
Minto, in charge of 'The Examiner,' was the 
first editor to secure the regular services of 
Theodore Watts as a contributor. The first 
article which he wrote for that paper was the 
occasion of the following scene, which took 
place on the evening of the day when the article 
had appeared, and at the house of W. B. Scott. 

'Bell Scott, who took a great interest in the 
"Examiner," was especially inquisitive about the 
new writer. After having in vain tried to get from 
Minto the name of the writer, he went up to Watts, 
and said: "I would give almost anything to know 
who the writer is who appears in the 'Examiner' 
for the first time today." "What makes you 
inquire about it?" said Watts. "What is the inter- 
est attaching to the writer of such fantastic stuff 
as that? Surely it is the most mannered writing 
that has appeared in the 'Examiner' for a long 
timel" Then, turning to Minto, he said: "I can't 
think, Minto, what made you print it at all." 
Scott, who had a most exalted opinion of Watts as 
a critic, was considerably abashed at this, and 
began to endeavour to withdraw some of his enthu- 
siastic remarks. This set Minto laughing aloud, 
and thus the secret got out.' 

Mr. Watts-Dunton's first meeting with Bor- 
row is described in his introduction to *Lav- 
engro,' Borrow figuring under the fictitious 
name of Dereham. 

'Dereham loved Richmond Park, and he seemed to 
know every tree. I found also that he was ex- 
tremely learned in deer, and seemed familiar with 
every dappled coat which, washed and burnished 
by the showers, seemed to shine in the sun like 
metal. Of course, I observed him closely, and I 
began to wonder whether I had encountered, in the 
silvery-haired giant striding by my side, with a 
vast umbrella under his arm, a true "Child of the 
Open Air." "Did a true Child of the Open Air 
ever carry a gigantic green umbrella that would 
have satisfied Sarah Gamp herself?" I murmured 
to Gordon, while Dereham lingered under a tree 
and, looking round the Park, said in a dreamy way, 
"Old England! Old England!" ' 

Probably the most interesting of all these 
personal passages is that which relates the con- 
versation between the author and Mr. Lowell 
upon the occasion of their first meeting, but it 
is too long to quote, and will not suffer mutila- 
tion. 

This fascinating book tempts to endless quo- 
tation and comment, but it is just as easy to 
stop here as it would be later on. A final word 
should be said of the illustrations, which include

Rossetti and others, and both outside and inside ;

A few intimate glimpses of this association 
are given us from time to time by Mr. Douglas, 
but we are deprived of anything more than 
these glimpses by the unwillingness of both Mr, 
Watts-Dunton and Mr, Swinburne to permit 
the privacy of their home to be unveiled.

The Story of oxtr Xatioxai. LiIbrary.* 



Some years ago a plan was formed to pro- 
duce a series of ' Contributions to American 
Library History,' to be edited and published 
under the auspices of the Library of Congress. 
Such a series of volumes, prepared according 
to a uniform plan, can not fail to prove of 
great interest, not only to librarians, but to all 
interested in the history of American civiliza- 
tion, as describing the development of one of 
the most potent agencies for culture. The vol- 
ume imder review is the first to appear, and it 
is very fitting that it should deal with the 
institution that has grown to be, in fact if not 
in name, the library of the nation. It deals 
with the formative period of the Library of 
Congress, ending with the appointment by 
Abraham Lincoln of Ainsworth R. Spofford to 
be its librarian. A second volume will deal 
with Mr. Spofford's administration and the 
short incumbency of Mr. Young, and a third 
volume will treat of the other libraries belong- 
ing to the general government. 

Mr. Johnston has taken great pains to collect 
a tremendous mass of material from both oflBcial 
and private sources. Congressional documents, 
the minutes of the Library Committee since 
1830 (those kept during the early years were 
destroyed in the fire of 1814, and from 1814 
to 1830 no records of its proceedings seem to 
have been made), files of newspapers and period- 
icals, such as ' The National Intelligencer, ' 'The 
Washington Republic,' and * The North Amer- 
ican Review,' as well as the writings of many

Government Printing Office. 



contemporary authors, have been searched and 
abstracted, and the abstracts orderly arranged 
and connected by a narrative. The result is a 
truly documentary history of over five hundred 
pages. An enumeration of the chapter headings 
will give a fair idea of the scope of the work. 
They are as follows: Conditions before 1800; 
Establishment of the Library, 1800-1805; 
Growth of the Library, 1805-1814; Destruction 
of the old Library and Purchase of the Jefferson 
Library; The Development of the Library, 
1814-1829; The Library in PoUtics; The Devel- 
opment of the Library, 1829-1851 ; Development 
of the Library, 1852-1864; Other Libraries of 
Congress and of the Government; The Smith- 
sonian Institution and Plans for a National 
Library. 

The documents reprinted in the last chapter 
cast a curious reflection on the appreciation 
which Congress up to that time had shown 
towards its Ubrary. In fact. Congress never 
regarded it as being more than its name implied, 
a Ubrary established for the use of its members. 
That the privilege of using the library was from 
the beginning open to the President and Vice- 
President of the United States, and was gradu- 
ally extended to the judges of the Supreme 
Court, to foreign ministers, to the heads of 
departments, and then to all officers of the 
government, serves only to emphasize this nar- 
row point of view. Voices were heard, however, 
almost from its establishment, urging that it 
ought indeed to be the Library of the Nation, 
and claiming for it a wider scope and a larger 
usefulness than it could have if merely intended 
for the members of Congress and the officials 
of the government. As the years went by, its 
scope was enlarged, and its collections outgrew 
the original purpose of its founders. But Con- 
gress still treated it as merely an adjunct to 
itself. 

The history of the Library during the period 
covered by Mr. Johnston's first volume is largely 
one of slow accumulation, disastrous fires, and 
congressional indifference. But it is also a 
history of large plans. Scientific men and 
writers in current periodicals were tireless in 
outlining plans for its development, and many 
members of the Joint Committee on the Library 
took a deep interest in its welfare. Among the 
successive members of the committee we find 
men like John Quincy Adams, Edward Everett, 
George Perkins Marsh, Rufus Choate, Horace 
;Mann, and Charles Francis Adams. ' The prin- 
cipal function of the committee,' the author 
states, 'was the selection of books for the 
Library.' But no uniform plan was followed. 
Mahlon Dickerson, who was chairman from 
1817 to 1828, * would have made it a library of 
science'; Edward Everett, who served on the 
committee, though never as chairman, from

[Feb. 1, 



1835 to 1835, ' would have made it a library of 
literature; still other members of the com- 
mittee thought it necessary to cater to the 
various tastes and peculiar fancies of divers 
and many members of Congress, members of 
the diplomatic corps, heads of departments, 
and others to whom the privileges of the Library 
were extended, who wanted anything new, and 
everything, if possible, entertaining.' One mem- 
ber of the committee proposed a plan 'of filling 
up each department of the Library in succes- 
sion,' and a contemporary writer ' said that 
under the proper direction the annual appro- 
priation of $5,000 might be so utilized as to 
make the Library in twenty years one of the 
first libraries in the world. It might even have 
been possible,' Mr. Johnston adds, ' by agreeing 
further to buy great collections of books as 
opportunities offered, to have made the Library 
the first of the great libraries of the world.' 
At this period the prices of books in the anti- 
quarian market were still very moderate; few 
American collectors had yet appeared on the 
scene. But the Library of Congress was not in 
the field, and to European booksellers * America 
meant chiefl}'^ New York and Providence.' 

It was in 1790 that a committee of Con- 
gress, with Representative Elbridge Gerry of 
Massachusetts as chairman, was appointed ' to 
report a catalogue of books necessary for the 
use of Congress, with an estimate of the expense, 
and the best mode of procuring them.' The 
committee reported in June, recommending an 
appropriation of $1,000. The report was laid 
on the table. Not until 1800, upon the removal 
of the Capital to Washington, was the matter 
again taken up; the sum of $5,000 was then 
appropriated ' for the purchase of such books 
as may be necessary for tlie use of Congress.' 
At first no annual appropriations were made 
for the purchase of books; $5,000 was again set 
aside for this purpose in 1806, and in 1811 
another $5,000. In 1816, Thomas Jefferson'*^ 
library was purchased for $23,950. From this 
year on, annual appropriations were made, at 
first varying between $1,000 and $2,000, until 
in 1825 it became $5,000, at which amount it 
remained during the whole period covered by 
the present volume — with the single exception 
of the year 1852-53, when $85,000 was set aside 
to replace the loss caused by the fire of 1851. 
The Librarian of Congress was from the begin- 
ning chosen by the President of the United 
States, and in 1802 Thomas Jefferson appointed 
John Berkley, who at the time was Clerk of 
the House of Representatives. When Berkley 
died, in 1807, his successor as Clerk of the 
House, Patrick Magruder, was also made Libra- 
rian of Congress. During Magruder's incum- 
bency, which lasted imtil 1815, as well as during 
that of his predecessor, the actual management 



of the Library seems to have been left to the 
Assistant Librarian. Magruder resigned in 
1814, and in 1815 George VVatterston, a Wash- 
ing'ton litterateur, was appointed. Much space 
— too much space — is given by Mr. J ohnston 
to the biography of this man, who may have 
been a prominent figure in the Capital in his 
days, but who was but a mediocre librarian. 
During the whirlwind caused by Andrew Jack- 
son, Watterston was removed, and John Silva 
Meehan was appointed in his place. The change 
was hardly for the better. Meehan was removed 
in 1861, being regarded as a Southern sympa- 
thizer, and Dr. J. G. Stephenson succeeded him. 
Stephenson resigned in 1863, and on the last 
day of 1864 President Lincoln appointed as 
his successor Ainsworth R. Spofford, who since 
1861 had served as Chief Assistant Librarian. 
Mr. Spofford had already rendered valuable 
service to the Library, especially in preparing 
the alphabetical author catalogue of 1864, 
which he followed up in 1869 with an ' Index 
of Subjects.' 

An interesting episode in the history of the 
Library during this period is the visit to this 
country of Alexandre Vattemare and the begin- 
ning of the system of. international exchange 
of documents and other publications between 
libraries of all countries. The founding of the 
Smithsonian Institution also falls within this 
period; the discussion of the proposed forma- 
tion, through the Smithson Fund, of a national 
library is treated at great length and forms 
one of the most interesting chapters in the book. 

Mr. Johnston's work is something more than 
a history — and also something less. It is a 
collection of documents strung together on a 
rather thin thread of narrative. This, one may 
suppose, was done advisedly, as the most fitting 
treatment of the material in hand, the mass 
of which is certainly appalling. What has been 
given is, consequently, not so much a history as 
material for a history. But as such it is of 
great value. The index is rather meagre.

the same thought in recalling the delight with 
which he read the single odd volume of Cot- 
ton's translation of the Essaj-s in his fathers 
library. ' It seemed to me as if I had myself 
written the book, in some former life, so sin- 
cerely it spoke my thought and experience.' 

Michael de ^Montaigne died on the 13th of 
September, 1592; one week later there was 
published in London Eobert Greene's 'A 
Groatsworth of Wit, ' containing the first 
printed allusion to Shakespeare. Sainte- 
Beuve's wisest of Frenchmen makes his bow 
and retires from the stage just as the wisest of 
Englishmen enters to fill it for all time. But 
how vast is wisdom to express herself with such 
absolute divergence. No man ever lived, 
surely, who so took both men and fools into his 
confidence as did Montaigne. The most enter- 
taining biography in all the world, the journal 
intime of a spirit as honest as it was wise and 
as vivacious as it was simple, is yet to be con- 
structed out of the immortal ' Essais. ' Of 
Shakespeare, from Shakespeare, we know noth- 
ing. The author of the greatest drama litera- 
ture has produced remains so shrouded in mys- 
tery, under a world-wide blaze of publicity, 
that an elaborate theory has grown up, not 
indeed that the player, WiUiam Shakespeare, 
did not exist, but that he did not write the 
works generally known by his name. 

The first edition of Montaigne's ' Eesais ' was 
published in 1580. The breadth of experience 
they show, the infinite variety of historical and 
classical allusion, their extraordinary philoso- 
phical insight into men and things, very nat- 
urally led to the supposition, of Villemain 
among others, that the author had been a con- 
siderable traveller. But at that time Montaigne 
had been, in his own language, ' scarce out of 
sight of the vanes of his own house. ' In fact 
he had gone no farther afield than the beaten 
path between his native Perigord and Paris. 
That path he had traversed many times, first 
as counsellor of Bordeaux and later as gentle- 
man of the King's bedchamber to Henry II. The 
outlook of the ' Essais ' on the world is jiist 
Montaigne. ' When I travel,' he says 
quaintly, ' I do not look for Gascons : I have 
left them at home. I rather seek for Greeks and 
Persians.' Montaigne's most extended search 
for Greeks and Persians took place during the 
years 1580 and 1581, when he travelled leisurely 
to Italy through Germany and Switzerland. 
His Journal of these travels is even more inter- 
esting in its way than the * Essais,' for Mon- 
taigne on horseback seeing the world is more 
uniformly attractive than Montaigne in his 
tower saying some things certainly that he had 
better not have said. He displayed the instinct 
of the genuine traveller in his fondness for 
devising tours off the main route, just as the 



mood seized him, counting on getting lost from 
his more prosaic companions. When they 
remonstrated with him, he explained conclu- 
sively that he seemed to be like ' one who reads 
some delightful story or good book, and dreads 
to turn the last page.' 

Naturally, the bent of Montaigne's mind led 
him to observe the way of life of foreign folk, 
how they lived and what sort of social and 
political institutions they had developed for 
themselves. For this reason, the philosophical 
Frenchman is the most interesting traveller in 
an age of travel. His diary furnishes all sorts 
of valuable and curious information about the 
Elizabethan Germans and Italians. Some of 
this information found its way into later edi- 
tions of the ' Essais, ' and doubtless the reason 
why the Journal was not published by Mon- 
taigne or by his family was that he regarded it 
largely as material for future ' Essais. ' 

It is a little difficult to understand Mon- 
taigne's regret that he had not taken a cook 
along, for it would be fairly easy to concoct a 
German meal or to furnish an Italian house 
from the Journal. And just as in the ' Essais ' 
the most incongruous subjects jostle one 
another, so here we learn in one sentence that 
in Ferrara the streets were paved with bricks 
and they served fruit on plates. Florence, a 
smaller town than Ferrara, was paved with flat 
stones without pattern or regularity. He found 
glass in the windows of even the smallest Swiss 
cottages, but the windows of Italian inns were 
open, except for huge wooden shutters that 
excluded sun, light, and air in bad weather. At 
Lucca, a fashionable watering-place, his bed 
was a movable frame resting on trestles and 
furnished only with a mattress and coverlet. 
Linen of all sorts, salt, cooking utensils, and 
candlesticks were rented extra. Dishes, glass- 
ware, and knives, the traveller bought himself. 
The cost of travel is recorded as high in Ger- 
many, cheaper in France, and cheapest in Italy, 
but Montaigne thought the German prices 

* quite justified ' by superior accommodations. 

There is an echo of Elizabethan music in the 
note of Fano in the Marches, ' Rhymesters 
are to be found in almost every inn,' and 

* there is a musical instrument in every shop, 
even the stocking-darner's at the corner of the 
street.' Later, of Empoli, near Florence, we 
read that the peasants have * lutes in their 
hands and the pastoral songs of Ariosto on 
their lips — which thing indeed may be 
observed all through Italy.' Toleration is a 
striking quality of this acute observation. Swiss 
cooking Montaigne found the best he had ever 
met with. So also he praises German stoves 
and feather coverlets and Italian oil. Pass- 
ing through Fomovo on his way home, he does 
not mention the great French victory there.

[Feb. 1, 



in 1495, while he goes omt of his way to visit 
the battlefield of Pavia where Francis I. lost 
all save that negligible piece of property he 
called his honor. 

Nowhere is Montaigne's large-minded tol- 
eration more marked than towards religions 
differences. In Augsburg he 'attended a Luth- 
eran baptism, in Eome he witnessed a Jewish 
circumcision. Curious facts of the change of 
religions turn up here and there. At Lindau 
the priest said there were only two or three 
Catholics in the place, but Montaigne observed 
that the priests and nuns still performed the 
service and drew their incomes. At Kempten 
in Bavaria he heard the mass celebi*ated on a 
Thursday with all the ceremonial of Easter 
Sunday at Notre Dame in Paris, but nobody 
was present but priests. Montaigne himself 
lived and died in the Catholic faith. He kissed 
the Pope's toe, and has left here, I fancy, the 
most entertaining account of that performance, 
throwing in a highly picturesque and just 
description of the Bolognese Pope, Gregory 
XIII. At Loreto he bore witness to his piety 
by setting up to Our Lady a silver memorial of 
himself, his wife, and his daughter. But he 
goes on to say almost immediately, ' I have 
a suspicion that they melt down the old silver 
plate and put it to other uses.' Tlie Holy 
City he testifies enjoyed less liberty than Ven- 
ice. Burglaries were common and the streets 
were notoriously unsafe after nightfall. Again, 
the Eoman revenue ofl&cers searched his boxes, 
turning over 'even the smallest articles of 
apparel,' while other Italian towns were sat- 
isfied by the presentation of the luggage for 
search. His Eoman experience with his books 
is characteristic. The books, among them a 
copy of the *Essais,' were all seized and kept 
for a long w'hile. Montaigne writes : ' This 
evening they brought back to me the vol- 
ume of my Essais, castigated and brought 
into harmony with the opinions of the monkish 
doctors.' It developed that the censor, unable 
himself to read French, had asked for the 
judgment of a French monk. Montaigne 
declined to agree with his countryman that 
he was in error on various points, — for 
instance, that it is cruel to inflict on men 
greater pain than is necessary to kill them, or 
that children should be brought up to look at 
all sides of a question. The censor, *a man 
of parts,' he records, ' completely exonerated 
me, and was anxious to let me see that he set 
small value on these emendations.' His book 
of Hours fell under suspicion because it was 
a Paris imprint, and 'La republique des 
Suisses' was not returned to him, 'because 
they had found out that the trianslator was a 
heretic, though his name did not appear any- 
where in the volume.' 



In Eome, Montaigne sought and obtained 
for himself the title of Eoman citizen. ' It is 
a vain title,' he says, 'nevertheless I take 
great pleasure in the possession of the same.' 
'Voila un aimable philosophe,' observes Sainte- 
Beuve, ' qui paye ouvertement son tribut ii 
I'illusion est a la vanite humaine.' But it 
was not wholly vanity that prompted the 
amiable philosopher to secure Eoman citizen- 
ship. Montaigne was by nature a citizen of 
the world, and Eome was to him of all cities the 
one most filled with the corporate idea, the 
one in which differences of nationality counted 
least. He felt at home there, the very air he 
thought the pleasantest and wholesomest he had 
ever breathed. He was in the city negotiating 
the business of citizenship during Holy Week, 
and he has considerable to say about the pomp 
and grandeur of the religious ceremonies. He 
hears a bull excommunicating the Huguenots 
read before the pope from the great portico of 
St. Peter's, he attends service in the Sistine 
Chapel, and one day on his way out after mass 
he stops, full of curiosity, to watch a priest 
exorcize an insane man. The shoes • and 
breeches of the flagellants on Good Friday sug- 
gested to him that they were persons of meian 
condition most of whom had hired themselves 
out for the occasion. This Eoane full of appeal 
to sight and sense was all for the court and 
the nobility. He noted that there were no main 
streets of trade, but that gardens and palaces 
abounded everywhere. These palaces built over 
the antique ruins of classic Eome Montaigne 
compared to the nests of martins and crows on 
the roofs and in the walls of the French 
churches destroyed by the Huguenots in Peri- 
gord. 

Here is the real Montaigne, profoundly 
impressed by the spell of Eome. Going about 
the city with his favorite authors, Plutarch and 
Seneca, in his head, he was delighted to find 
that he needed no other guide, and he declared 
that the only Eome he recognized was the sky 
above his head and the august sites beneath his 
feet. What he saw was the sepulchre of the 
ancient world, and the vastness of a world in 
ruins suggested to him, he said, not compre- 
hension, but respect and reverence only. 

Much of the interest of Montaigne's travels 
comes from his habit everywhere of seeking out 
and talking with all sorts and conditions of 
men. In Basel he supped with Felix Plater 
and saw, for the first time, in the great physi- 
cian's house an articulated skeleton. He made 
a point in Ferrara of going to see the unhappy 
Tasso in his prison-house, and he dined in 
Florence with the Grand Duke, Francesco dei 
Medici, and his Venetian wife, Bianca Capello. 
He thought the Grand Duchess a hand- 
some woman, according to Italian taste, with

an agreeable and inspiring face. On the whole, 
it is clear that Montaigne did not see much 
beauty abroad. One pretty exception to the 
monotony of comments on the plainness of 
Grerman and Italian women is the record of his 
secretary, made in Stertziag in the Tyrol : * M. 
de Montaigne, having espied a fair young girl 
in a church, asked if she could speak Latin, 
deeming she was a scholar.' 

From these conversations, or from reflections 
to which they gave rise, there flows a steady 
stream of engaging wisdom. He went to a 
dance of country folk in the great hall of the 
Grand Duke's palace in Florence, and reflects, 
' I have a notion that this licence, which they 
enjoy on the great feast day of the city, seems 
to them a sort of shadow of their lost liberty.' 
Of Pistoia, with its gonfalonier and nine priors 
living in great state in the grand ducal palace 
during their short term of office, but essentially 
imprisoned there for the two months, he writes : 
* I felt pity at the sight of men thus satisfied 
with these apish tricks.' At the baths of 
Lucca two physicians wait upon the traveller 
and beg him to act as umpire in their consulta- 
tion over the case of a nephew of Cardinal de 
Cesis, * whereupon,' says Montaigne, * I could 
not help laughing in my sleeve,' adding, 
' Medicine after all is a poor affair.' For 
some reason the French ambassador was denied 
access to the Vatican Librarj- to which Mon- 
taigne was admitted without difficult}'. He 
philosophises, — *A11 things come easily to men 
of a certain temper, and are unattainable by 
others. Right occasion and opportunity have 
their privileges, and oftentimes hold out to 
ordinary folk what they deny to kings.' 

Montaigne's Journal was first translated into 
English by William Hazlitt, and annexed to 
his edition of Charles Cotton's translation of 
the Essays in 1842. Curiously enough, Mr. 
W. Carew Hazlitt, in a recent reprint (1902) 
of his father's work, omits the translation of 
the Journal for the whimsical reason, entirely 
gratuitous, that the diary is all in the third 
person and was dictated by Montaigne to his 
secretary. As a matter of fact more than half 
of the story of the journey, the last half, was 
written by Montaigne's own hand, as William 
Hazlitt expressly notes when he comes to the 
break. But Hazlitf s translation is now out of 
date, and Mr. W. G. Waters has done a real 
service to letters by making a new one. His 
book has been beautifully printed by BaUantyne 
of Edinburgh, and is enriched by photogravures 
of Montaigne and of his tomb in the vestibule 
of the Hall of Faculties at Bordeaux, together 
with nine plates from Piranesi's ' Views of 

Maby Augusta Scott. 



THE liUXUKTES OF AXTIQUARIAXISM.* 

The rich man has his luxuries — yachts, 
automobiles, palaces, mostly vanities of the 
senses to the austere philosophic mind. Why 
should not the poor scholar have his, — vast 
libraries, rare manuscripts, recherche fac- 
similes, vain and non-productive though these 
things may sometimes seem to tiie utilitarian 
rich? 

'Ah, why 
Shoald life all labour beT 

the Lotos-Eater (the Natural Man) pointedly 
inquires. Not quite the same is the inquiry 
of the antiquarian scholar on the American 
side of the great waters, who is trying to 
cooperate in the modem movement for the 
resuscitation and re-interpretation of the past 
in its richer and more significant and more 
vital epochs. Rather his plaint is: Why, if 
life is to be labor, should labor be with such 
imperfect materials and means? Why, with 
such wealth behind us and around us, must 
American libraries of research, generous in 
some of their beginnings, be so few, so slow of 
growth, so hampered and neglected? Why is 
it that our university libraries are almost uni- 
formly unendowed and ill-housed, confined to 
a modicum of books in print, and few of them 
rich in the older material, much of it still pux- 
diasable, which makes true historical and lit- 
erary research possible? But, even as he puts 
the question, are not riches and learning 
already striking hands? Is not the time now 
come when books as well as laboratory and 
museum material shall begin to bulk in uni- 
versity budgets and in the gifts of our Car- 
negies and our Rockefellers? 

In England at least, if not in America, things 
are being done in more liberal measure. There 
is the incomparable library of the British 
Museum, and a score of others that are supple- 
mentary; publishing societies, like the Early 
English Text Society, are supported, even 
though meagrely; there, too, facsimile edi- 
tions of the Shakespeare folios and of the 
first Chaucer folio are being published; the 
Palaeographical Society has been re-established; 
and, as a striking single illustration of the 
trend over there, the present magnificent photo- 
graphic facsimile and transcript of an often- 
cited but little-known Elizabeiian manuscript 
in the library of the Duke of Northumberland 
has just been given to the world. 

The manuscript itself is valuable, and brings 
to light some new material. Every scholar and 
student of Elizabethan literature must be

deeply grateful for the gift thus made to the 
learned public. It is to be hoped that more of 
the many existing manuscripts of this sort 
may be similarly produced. But, aiter all, the 
thrifty and frugal mind must query whether 
the value in this case is commensurate with the 
outlay. As it stands, we have a beautiful monu- 
ment of palaeography; but what if the tran- 
script alone had been printed, in modest form, 
and the rest of the sum here expended had been 
turned in to the scanty treasury of the Early 
English Text Society? Would we not be bet- 
ter off if that had been done ? And so this vol- 
ume seems to us to be one of the luxuries of 
antiquarianism, set forth by the munificence 
of a patron. Yet who will be socialist enough 
to say that the taste and personal preference 
of this patron should not be allowed? 

The manuscript, which dates about 1597, and 
seems to have been written for one of Bacon's 
kin, perhaps in Bacon's own scriptorium, con- 
tains in its present mutilated form some nine 
pieces, six of them by Bacon himself, — two or 
three of these latter being well-known tracts 
or speeches of his, one a copy of speeches for 
a court 'Device' (two of them unknown 
before the discovery of this MS. in 1867), one 
a brief essay * Of Magnanimitie or heroicall 
virtue ' never before printed, and another, ' An 
Advertisement touching private Censure, ^ 
dealing with the toleration question, never 
before printed. There is also a brief speech 
'ffor the Earle of Sussex at ye tilt, an: 96,' 
never before printed and of unknown author- 
ship, and the well-known letter of Sir Philip 
Sidney to Queen Elizabeth against the Anjou 
marriage. The bulk of the volume, however, is 
taken up with that choice anonymous specimen 
of Elizabethan personal abuse and political 
invective known as * Leicester's Common- 
wealth. '■ There is something monumentally 
impudent yet delicious in the ending of this 
latter piece, where the author, after pursuing 
Leicester through some eighty folio pages with 
unrelenting and atrocious abuse, craves par- 
don 'of my Lord of Leicester for my boldnesse, 
if I have been too plaine with him'! The 
Bacon material that is new presents little of 
great value. The part not new is instructive 
for various varianis from the accepted texts, 
and thus the volume is important for students 
of Bacon. 

But the manuscript as we have it here is 
mutilated. The outer sheet, among numerous 
scribblings, seems to present a list of the orig- 
inal contents, omitting, however, four of the 
pieces actually contained in the group. If we 
may trust this list, there was once in the vol- 
ume, along with additional essays by Bacon, 
the lost play of ' The He of Dogs ' by Nash, 
and 'Asmund and Cornelia'; also two Shake- 



spearian plays, the 'Kichard II.' and 'Rich- 
ard III.' Among the scribblings, too, along 
with entries of tiie names of Thomas Nashe. 
Bacon, and William Shakespeare, in separate 
lines, occurs in one line the mysterious con- 
junction 'By Mr. ffrauncis William Shake- 
speare.' Another proof, of course, of the 
Baconian authorship of Shakespeare! Of the 
evidence of such furtive inference, of innuendo, 
and of laborious intricate vaticination, like 
that of medicine man, astrologer, or alchemist 
in all ages, is that theory built up!

What May We Believe ? * 



Science, speaking objectively, is concerned 
with physical realities; a scientific concept is 
one which has for its basis sense-impressions, 
regarded by us as tokens of an external world 
of being. Metaphysical conceptions are those 
resulting from the projection of normally- 
derived concepts, in various combinations, into 
regions where they are beyond the test of expe- 
rience. We may postulate a third region of 
Metapsychics, conceivable in the sense that the 
metaphysics, or even physics, of some superior 
being might be wholly metapsychical, i. e., 
unthinkable, to us. Certainly, as we descend in 
the scale of life, there must soon come a point 
where our metaphysics become metapsychic, and 
eventually one where our physics are equally 
so, and self-consciousness finally sinks in the 
infrapsychic. 

The mind of man, thus confined within nar- 
row limits of clear perception, has always been 
restless. In truth, this is not because of the 
smallness of his field, but rather because of 
the obscurity of its boundaries, and their varia- 
bility according to individual and race. The 
man of science is ever for enlarging his domain, 
but he purposes that it shall be his indeed, from 
wall to wall; his notion of property is that 
understood by the law, not that of the artist 
who owns the distant landscape by virtue of his 
enjoyment of it. The idealist refuses to recog- 
nize boundaries, and insists upon planting his 
choicest flowers on the other side of the wall; 
where, perchance, the wild beasts devour them, 
and the man of science says ' I told you so.' 

The reconciliation of these quarrelsome indi- 
viduals is no light task. Your modem idealist 
denies the proposition, so admirable to common 
sense, that a bird in the hand is worth two in

the bush. He even ventures to urge that it is 
not worth one in the bush, when that one hops 
cheerfully and sings sweetly. Wliat is one to 
say to such an unreasonable individual? Must 
we prove that it ts in the hand, after all, to 
bring about an agreement? That, possibly, is 
not worth while; it is too much like breaking 
the cup to prove its fragility. 

The three books at present under review 
attempt, in their several ways, either to move 
the wall or justify the individual who would 
cUmb over it. It is hardly possible to take a 
precisely neutral position, although that is here 
and there attempted. 

Dr. William Osier, Professor of Medicine, 
Johns Hopkins University, just now appointed 
Regius Professor of Medicine in the University- 
of Oxford, delivered the Ingersoll Lecture 
on Immortality at Harvard University in 1904. 
Coming after James, Fiske, and others of high 
renown, he was justified in the expression of 
a certain modest timidity; but as we close the 
little book we feel proud to be of the English- 
speaking race, with a language capable of being 
put to such worthy use. The argument is not 
of the strenuous sort; the words flow gently 
and naturally, as they expose the mellowed 
thought of a mature and reverent mind. As we 
found in reading James, the very mildness of 
the insistence, the very modesty of the presenta- 
tion, lends to it a force which is not at all 
inherent in many a fist-aided pulpit oration. 
We may be permitted a single quotation, suf- 
ficiently long to give a good idea of the lan- 
guage and the meaning. 

' A word in conclusion to the young men in the 
audience. As perplexity of soul will be your lot 
and portion, accept the situation with a good grace. 
The hopes and fears which make us men are insep- 
arable, and this wine-press of Doubt each one of 
you must tread alone. It is a trouble from which 
no man may relieve his brother or make agreement 
with another for him. Better that your spirit's 
bark be driven far from the shore — far from the 
trembling throng whose sails were never to the 
tempest given — than that you should tie it up to 
rot at some lethean wharf. On the question before 
us wide and far your hearts will range from those 
early days when matins and evensong, evensong 
and matins sang the larger hope of humanity into 
your young souls. In certain of you the changes 
and chances of the years ahead will reduce this to 
a vague sense of eternal continuity, with which, as 
Walter Pater says, none of us wholly part. In a 
very few it will be begotten again to the lively 
hope of the Teresians; while a majority will retain 
the sabbatical interest of the Laodicean, as little 
able to appreciate the fervid enthusiasm of the one 
as the cold philosophy of the other. Some of you 
will wander through all phases, to come at last, I 
trust, to the opinion of Cicero, who had rather be 
mistaken with Plato than be right with those who 
deny altogether the life after death; and this u 
my own confessio fidei: (Pp. 42-43.) 

The volume entitled ' Ideals of Science and 
Faith ' consists of a series of essays by 



various British writers, edited by tiie Eev. 
J. E. Hand, who provides a rather prosy 
introduction. The essays are of various 
degrees of merit, the best being *A 
Physicist's Approach,' by Sir Oliver Lodge, 
*A Biological Approach,' by Professors J. A. 
Tliomson and Patrick Geddes, *A Sociolog- 
ical Approach towards Unity,' by Mr. Victor V. 
Branford, and *An Educational Approach — 
A Technical Approach,' by Professor Geddes. 
The Eev. John Kelman, in *A Presbyterian 
Approach,' frankly accepts the teachings of 
science, and sums up his position thus ; 

' Looking forward, we wait for new light, not only 
without trembling for the faith, but with eager 
cnriosity that we may understand our faith more 
perfectly. Looking back, along the line of the his- 
tory of Presbyterianism, we see a long controversy, 
due mainly to a misunderstanding. But behind and 
beneath all controversy, we are proud to recognize 
in Presbyterian faith the basal principles of all true 
science — the demand for unity and order, and the 
assertion of the rights of intellect.' (P. 2Ao.) 

On the other hand, Mr. Wilirid Ward, speaking 
for the Church of Rome, says: 

* The results of the scientific movement, as they 
come to us from the hands of the opponents of 
Christianity, the church cannot accept. They are 
not pure science. What is advanced as science is in 
reaUty often subtly coloured by the prepossessions 
of its advocates. Only learning and thought among 
Christians themselves, fairly equal in extent and 
quality to those of their opponents, can afford the 
means for the desired synthesis.' (P. 322.) 

Mr. Branford's essay is a very suggestive one, 
setting forth the view that human activities 
continually tend to run — not exactly ' to 
seed,' but to barrenness in formalism and 
ceremonialism. That which was first symbolic 
is at length taken for the thing it symbolizes, 
while the thing itself is forgotten. In religion 
the outcome is, of course, idolatry; in industry 
it is finance, whereby the manipulation of the 
tokens of wealth is supposed to be equivalent 
to the production of goods, and the rich man 
has often no more relation to the sources of 
his gains than the idol has to the God (or, if 
you like, idea) he was originally intended to 
typify. In literature and art, the equivalent 
of idolatry is found in the work of the stylists, 
who are satisfied with clever technique, though 
the result may be idiotic or beastly to the man 
who looks beneath the surface. In politics, the 
expression of a living need or sentiment tends 
at length to crystallize into a rigid law, which 
presently assumes superiority over the people 
for whose good it was made, and compels those 
who would make necessary readjustments at 
times to resort to revolutions. Will our readers 
be scandalized if we suggest that the United 
States Constitution is already too much like an 
idol? Science does not escape from the tend- 
ency to formalism any more than religion, poli-

tics, industry, or art. If it now seems free, it 
is because in the more civilized countries it is 
growing rapidly; but those who are intimately 
acquainted with its condition are well aware 
that 'eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,' 
in science as elsewhere. There have been times 
when science was almost the least progressive 
of human activities, and our author intimates 
that certain phases of mathematics today come 
dangerously near to pure formalism. 

Mr. Orlando J. . Smith, in his book called 
'Balance,' endeavors to deduce human immor- 
tality, and other things, from Newton's postu- 
late that * to every action there is an equal and 
opposite reaction.' In other words, to revert to 
the simile given at the beginning of this article, 
he undertakes to prove that these things are 
not really outside the wall. The result is unsat- 
isfactory to the materialists, who do not accept 
his demonstration as valid, and equally so to 
those who like the other side of the wall, because 
it is the other side. The little book was sent to 
a large number of persons (mostly D.D.'s, but 
including Messrs. Mallock, Benjamin Kidd, 
etc.) before publication, with requests for a 
review, and these reviews, favorable and unfav- 
orable, have been published with it. Further 
review is therefore perhaps superfluous, though 
there are many things one would like to say.

more than a glimpse of a world in which the one 
salient fact is human sympathy and earnest 
endeavor at understanding and interpretation. 
All these books, — some of them as beautiful as 
modern color processes for real works of art 
can make them, most of the others with photo- 
graphs reproduced in half-tone, — survey the 
foreigner with pleasure and in friendship, seek- 
ing to bring the people of the world together 
on a basis of common sympathy and apprecia- 
tion, and succeeding to a marked degree. No 
one will rise from a reading of these numerous 
works without being more amicably disposed 
toward those of other climes and races, with- 
out a widening of sympathies as well as a 
deeper comprehension of facts. And this is 
very modem and significant. 

The most beautiful of these books is that for 
which Mr. Hallam Murray has made a devout 
pilgrimage 'On the Old Road through France 
to Florence.' In the earlier half of his jour- 
ney, from Rouen to the confines of Italy at 
Mentone, he was accompanied by Mr. Henry 
W. Nevinson, in the latter half, on to the 
beauties of Florence, by Mr. Montgomery Car- 
'michael. The text of the book is subordinate 
to the illustrations, of which there are no fewer 
than forty-eight in color, admirably printed on 
paper more dull and hence more grateful to 
the eye than usual, besides eighteen sketches 
printed in the text. The cover shows the fleurs- 
de-lis of France and of Florence, with the 
scallop shell of Normandy and the pilgrim, a 
commendable and appropriate bit of symbolism. 
The narrative, however, refuses to stand upon 
a lower level even than Mr. Murray's beautiful 
pictures, being informed with the spirit of true 
literature, filled with historical references, and 
not without the glamour of poetry from the 
lands where the world of modem poesy came 
into being. There is, for example, a chapter 
in Mr. Nevinson's account on ' Minor Saints

and Prophets/ from which the following is 
worth reprinting: 

' Minor saints, minor poets, — the whole of this 
country of Languedoc and Provence has been full 
of them. They are the great benefactors of man- \ 
kind. The times that produce great saints and great | 
poets can look after themselves. When St. Francis 
or Dante is at work, no one is likely to forget the 
worship of the Holy Ghost. But it is during the 
years when the spirit of man burns low, when peo- 
ple live and die with souls unkindled, wallowing 
in the common round, the daily task, the struggle 
for an average and uninspired existence — it is then 
that the minor saint, the minor poet, fulfill their 
benefaction and maintain the tradition of that holy 
spirituality which neither strives, nor cries, nor 
pays. ' 

To build a boat in the mountains of Switzer- 
land, convey it to Lake Zurich, and thence 
navigate it (when it was not being towed) down 
the Ehine through Germany and Holland and 
across to the mouth of the Thames, surely 
make up an achievement sufficiently remarkable 
to deserve commemoration in book form. Hence 
Mr. Donald Maxwell's * Log of the " Griffin " ' 
will be found full of strange events, told with 
the utmost good humor, and — as the purpose of 
the long voyage was rather the making of pic- 
tures than anything else — full also of charm- 
ing sketches of German and Dutch scenes, 
partly the work of the author and partly that 
of his first mate and sole companion, Mr. Cot- 
tington Taylor. There were some exciting 
events during the voyage, — the * Griffin* 
was twice shipwrecked, — and the manner in 
which it was greeted by the inhabitants along 
the river is really illustrative of national char- 
acter: it was not until the little ship was in 
the Thames that it was subjected to ridicule! 
Without being in any way a serious work, the 
narrative c-ommends itself as well-told, vera- 
cious, original; while in its artistic aspect the 
book is beautiful. 

As evidence of what can be done by the 
strenuous traveller in a very short time, tiie 
book by Mr. John TJ. Higinbotham, a busi- 
ness man of Chicago, entitled 'Three Weeks 
in Europe, ' is noteworthy. Within the brief 
period named, the author contrived to see some- 
thing of Xaples, Capri, Pompeii, Eome, Flor- 
ence, Venice, !Milan, Lugano, Lucerne, Berne, 
Zurich, Shaffhausen, Bale, and had three days 
in Paris and as many in London. The narra- 
tive is good-natured, quite without pretension, 
and readable ; and it is provided with numerous 
illustrations, reproduc-ed from photographs, 
apparently of Mr. Higinbotham's own taking. 

Mr. Gilbert Watson's ' Sunshine and Senti- 
ment in Portugal ' is a curious book, in which 
fact and fiction are so commingled that it is 
difficult to distinguish each from each. We 
make out that the author fell in love with a 
very pretty Portugese girl while accompany- 



ing an expedition for excavating certain lime- 
stone caves near Faro, and that nothing par- 
ticular came from either the love affair or the 
excavation, except the present book. It justi- 
fies its name, for it is bright and sunny, and 
succeeds in giving an idea of certain unin- 
spected sides of the Portuguese character, induc- 
ing the reflection that very little is known, about 
a country that appears to improve mightily upon 
intimate contact. The illustrations, which 
are rather indifferent, appear to be by the author. 

There is little in the book of Dr. Hugo Ganz 
concerning the Bussia of to-day that adds to- 
the recent knowledge poured forth so profusely 
concerning that unhappy land. He proves it 
to be indeed * The Land of Biddies, ' as many 
a traveller has done before him; but he does- 
this largely out of the mouths of distinguished 
individuals whose names he withholds. Him- 
self an Austrian, with prejudices under full 
control, he made no special preparation for his 
sojourn imder alien skies, — his chief concern 
seemingly having been to escape the courtesies 
of the Bussian secret police, about whom he had 
every reason to feel apprehensive. He has 
much to say about von Plehve which seems to 
indicate that his taking off was a great national 
benefit. One searching chapter on the imperial 
family is perhaps the most enlightening series of 
statements in the book, — certainly the most 
significant at this time. With a kindness of 
heart and intention that cannot be gainsaid, 
there is nevertheless in the Czar a weakness of 
judgment described as 'almost pathological,' 
and this with an intellect which Dr. Ganz says 
can best be characterized as 'subtle.' After 
reading the book, Busia still remains the land 
of contradiction. The translation, by ^Mj-. 
Herman Bosenthal, is into excellent English. 

Old Galloway, especially that portion of it 
known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, is 
exploited by Mr. S. B. Crockett in his * Baider- 
land, ' both historically and in a literary sense. 
He has gathered together the old legends of a 
spot long independent of settled law as under- 
stood by its neighbors, and has scattered these 
legends through the work, giving it th.e air of 
a collection of more or le« doubtfiQ history 
but of excellent literary material. About these- 
episodes are woven fragments of descriptioni 
and statements taken from the authentic his- 
tories, bits of modem experiences, and descrip- 
tions of natural scenes and beai*ties. The work 
concludes with 'The Diary of an Eighteenth- 
Century Galloway Laird, ' one William Cun- 
inghame of Coprington, who spent much time 
in Virginia as manager for the tobacco lords of 
that day. The book has an index, and the 
drawings of Mr. Joseph Pennell are, as always,, 
delightful.

THE DIAL. 



[Feb. 1, 



Mr. Moussa Aflalo, author of 'The Truth 
about Morocco, ' although a British subject, was 
for almost a lifetime continually connected with 
the courts of successive Sultans of that little 
known land. His book is written with an eye 
single to overthrowing that policy of Great 
Britain which may be best described as giving 
France a free hand for the annexation of the 
Morocco territory to its other northern African 
possessions, in return for a freer hand accorded 
England in the settlement of questions now 
agitating the Far East, — in effect a partial 
abrogation of the alliance between France and 
Russia. It is, in the main, an attack upon 
Lord Lansdowne's policy in respect to Morocco 
and England's commercial interests there, and 
devotes itself to showing how great the loss 
will be when France has assumed control, and 
how thoroughly everything painfully done to 
•raise British prestige through a long series of 
years has been overturned by a scratch of the 
pen. The book presents a thorough statement 
of the attitude of Morocco toward the outer 
world, by one in possession of the facts. 

The Hon. Elbert E. Farman was for many 
years United States Consul-Oeneral at Cairo, 
and as the highest official representative of his 
country in Egypt at the time of General 
Grant's visit to that interesting region in May 
and June of 1877, he was thrown into intimate 
association with that distinguished soldier dur- 
ing his tour up the Nile. By skilfully blend- 
ing with his descriptive narrative, 'Along the 
Nile with General Grant,' a really profound 
knowledge of Egyptian antiquities and of the 
most modern developments, Mr. Farmian has 
succeeded in keeping his book fully up to the 
times in one respect, while presenting an excel- 
lent portrait of Grant on the other. To Amer- 
icans, nothing can be of more interest than the 
report of Grant's conversation during the jour- 
ney, given in the General's own words. 

'When I went to Washington to take command 
of the armies, I had in mind three plans for a move- 
ment upon the forces under General Lee. One was 
that which I adopted. A second was to divide the 
army of the Potomac into three divisions, and with 
ten days' rations cut loose from Washington and 
move quickly to the northwest of ESchmond and 
compel Lee to fight immediately a decisive battle. 
If I had then had two generals that I had known 
as well as I afterwards knew Generals Sherman and 
Sheridan, and in whose ability I had had the same 
■confidence that I afterwards had in theirs, I should 
have adopted this plan. I would have taken com- 
.inand personally of one of these divisions and placed 
the two Generals each in command of one of the 
•others. But I had no generals that I then dared 
to trust with so important an undertaking. . . . 
I adopted the first because I regarded it as certain 
•of success, though I knew it would involve hard 
fighting and great sacrifices.' 

/ Dar-ul-Islam, ' the title of Mr. Mark 
^Sykes's really enjoyable volume, signifies 'the 



heart of Mohammedanism, ' and is most apt. 
His wanderings began at Beyrut, in November, 
1902, and ended at the Eussian frontier not 
far from Mount Ararat, apparently in the mid- 
dle of 1903. His journey took him to Damascus, 
Palmyra, Aleppo, Zeitun, Diarbekr, Nisibin, 
Sulimanieh on the Persian frontier, Mosul, 
Bitlis, Van, and Mosuna, and thence home by 
way of Orgoif, Tiflis, Batum, and the Black 
Sea. Mr. Sykes, it seems, is an Irishman, and 
he brings to his book a keen sense of the ridic- 
ulous which compels liis delighted readers to 
share with him many wonderful things he came 
upon during his extended tour, some of it over 
lands little known to the Caucasian of to-day. 
Of these he drew sketch maps, and his text 
corrects some errors of the guide-books, whidh 
in the main, however, were found accurate. He 
shared the life of the people among whom he 
sojourned, and he has kindly words to say for 
the Turk at all times, — many more, in fact, 
than for the degraded races to which the Otto- 
man empire, in spite of impressions to the con- 
trary, is still bringing peace and enlighten- 
ment. He dwells on the democracy of the 
East, too firmly a part of the daily life to 
require argument regarding it. We reproduce a 
passage describing an incident witnessed by the 
author at Constantinople. 

'We passed the funeral of a Hamal porter. In 
Moslem countries it is customary for the friends 
of the dead to carry them to the grave, taking turns 
to put their shoulders beneath the load; but this 
poor, rough coffin was only borne by three, and no 
one followed to mourn or help. In the midst of 
the bustle of the street, the cracking of whips, the 
cries of the hawkers, the laughter and playing of 
children, this sad, shuflSing, laboring group had a 
piteous and forlorn appearance. On the other side 
of the road walked a Palace aide-de-camp tightly 
laced in a smart Prussian uniform; he jingled his 
spurs and clanked his sword in the manner of the 
continental oflScer; he curled his mustache like a fop 
and smoked his cigarette with an air of languid 
condescension, in excellent imitation of the lieuten- 
ant of Western Europe and his marvelous swagger, 
bom of years of peaceful armament; but still when 
this man saw the funeral, he hooked up his sword, 
threw away his cigarette, and, stepping out into 
the street, put his shoulder under the coffin and 
strode along sharing the burden with the three 
ragged porters.' 

Mr. H. Valentine Greer, an Englishman, was 
associated with the researches conducted by the 
University of Pennsylvania on the site of 
ancient Nippur in Mesopotamia, and with Pro- 
fessor Flinders Petrie in the excavations in 
Egypt; and he has combined the results of 
his experiences in a book entitled ' By Nile and 
Euphrates. ' So far as the valley of the latter 
river is concerned, he has a tale of its inhabi- 
tants and their rulers, the Turks, varying con- 
sidertably from that of Mr. Sykes, in the book 
last mentioned, — it may be assumed, becaiLse 
he was brought into little contact with the 



1905.] 



THE DTAT.

Turks as individuals. Of the scientific and his- 
torical results of his various excavations he 
has almost nothing to say, those being reserved 
for the official publications of their directors. 
One of his experiences at Bahsamun, near Fay- 
oum, is worth reprinting. 

'In one tomb I had a curious experience. Ali 
had just cleared the entrance from the shaft as I 
came upon the scene, and as I looked into the 
chamber by the light of a candle it seemed as if the 
place had never been touched. There were more 
than a dozen bodies, which were ranged around 
the walls, and the floor was covered with a thick 
layer of dust. The minute I stepped into the cham- 
ber I broke the crust of dust, and before my aston- 
ished eyes the whole contents of the tomb crum- 
bled away instantly. It was rather an uncanny 
sight, but the explanation was simple enough. The 
dust had settled over the bodies, after the last 
burial, and becoming moist had practically taken 
a mould of everything that lay under it and hard- 
ened sufficiently to keep its shape as the shrinkage 
and sinking of what lay beneath had taken place. 
Utterly undisturbed, it had been strong enough to 
support its own weight, but, naturally, when I trod 
upon it the lot crumbled to powder.' 

The author gives an account of the misunder- 
standing which sent him back to England after 
he had reached the site of Nippur, in full 
accordanc-e with Professor Hilprecht's state- 
ments. The book is well illustrated with repro- 
duced photographs. 

In a portly volume entitled ' Inner Jeru- 
salem, ' filled with illustrative photographs of 
places and scenes, Mr. A. Goodrich- Freer has 
contrived to answer a great many interesting 
questions regarding life in the Holy City, so 
that the reader rises from the work with a 
sense of having at last learned just what Jeru- 
salem means to its widely assorted inhabitants, 
especially to those who comprise the European 
colonies there. The knowledge displayed in 
the book is such as could have been acquired 
only by long residence, and is used with dis- 
crimination and a sympathetic outlook upon 
the curious ramifications of temporal and spir- 
itual power. Mr. Freer gives some statistics 
concerning Protestant missions in that quarter, 
which go to show that the expense of bringing 
an occasional unbeliever to the Cross is some- 
what disproportionate to results achieved else- 
where. He summarizes the results of the 
activities of the Church Missionary Society 
(Anglican), from 1895 to 1901 inclusive, as 
follows : ' In seven years there has been a 
total expenditure in Palestine of £114,370. . . 
The number of adult baptisms has been nine, 
... at the cost of £12,707 per head. ' It 
is to be observed that here the Protestants are 
debarred from attempting to convert members 
of other Christian churches, and from pros- 
elytization among Moslems, as matters of essen- 
tial comity and policy. England appears to 
be exceedingly backward in everything that 



could add to her prestige in this region, while 
the comparatively recent visit of the German 
Emperor has been productive of striking results. 

A number of Siamese officials gathered 
together at the recent Louisana Purchase Expo- 
sition in St. Louis have combined to give a 
graphic and authentic account of the land they 
serve, calling the work ' The Kingdom of 
Siam. ' It contains everything the stranger 
needs to know of a fascinating country, pros- 
pering under an autocrat so modem that he 
justifies the old statement regarding the gov- 
ernmental efficiency of the benevolent despot, 
with customs and laws as exotic as can well be 
imagined. Siam has taken long strides for- 
ward in recent years, as the statistics adduced 
bear ample witne^; and there seems to have 
been a hand sufficiently restraining to keep the 
people of the kingdom from the specious 
advances of Christendom, implying slums no 
less than palaces. The book has no literary 
endeavor manifest in its pages, bein^ rather a 
complete hand-book of the kingdom^ with 
numerous illustrations of persons and places, — 
an encyclopedia in little. 

Camera in hand, Mr. William Seymour 
Edwards set forth from his home in West Vir- 
ginia in August, 1903, on a long journey to 
the Xorth by way of the great lakes. He 
returned late in October, stopping at the Fair 
in Buffalo on his way. Letters home, written 
in simple and straightforward style, and reveal- 
ing a pleasant personality, have been gathered 
into a pleasant volume bearing the title * In to 
the Yukon,' which, if it says nothing new, at 
least says it brightly and interestingly. The 
illustrations consist of reproduced snap shots 
taken by the author. Wallace Eice.

ularly to the needs of English than- of American

the chief interest of the book to us lies in its 
revelation of these differences of library organi-

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



cantiuental Europe, England was slow to see the 
need of public libraries. Chapters two, three, 
and four deal with, organization, classification, 
and cataloguing, and such minor details as book- 
repairing, correspondence, reports, helping read- 
ers, and what to do in emergencies. Chapter five 
treats of librarj' extension work, a branch of 
public service less developed than with us. The 
final chapter is really the only one dealing 
specifically with the library assistant, for whom 
the book Avas written. Matters of pei-sonal con- 
duct and obedience to superiors ai'e discussed, 
and fatherly advice is freely offered to the ambi- 
tious subordinate who hopes to rise. The impor- 
tance of general information, of knowing some- 
thing of everything rather than everything of 
something, is dwelt upon. The usefulness of 
this smattering of knowledge in library work is, 
perhaps unfortunately, not to be denied; yet our 
authors would have done well to advise in addi- 
tion a scholarly application to some one branch 
of learning. A few matters of no value to 
American library workers will be found in the 
book, such as the numerous references to the 
* indicator ' and its proper use. Since the old 
Boston Public Library indicator was discarded, 
thirty years ago, this cumbersome and in large 
libraries impracticable method of showing what 
books are in and what are out, has rarely if ever 
been emploj^ed in our libraries. In the chapter 
on cataloguing, which might well have discussed 
more at length the various kinds of catalogues, 
the usefulness in many instances of a title entry 
together with subject and author entries is 
insufl&ciently recognized. An appendix gives the 
Public Library Act of 1892. A second appendix 
outlines a course of reading for junior assistants. 
As a work of literature this jDrimer leaves some- 
thing to be desired. In a treatise emphasizing 
again and again the importance of accuracy and 
of attention to details, it is startling to meet 
with so slovenly a sentence as this, having refer- 
ence to these very matters of detail: ' But if, 
as is often unfortunately the case — especially 
when a new library has to be prepared for 
opening in a very limited time — they are neg- 
lected, it will be found very diflScult to after- 
wards teach the staff the wisdom of so doing.' 
As an example of the printer's art, the little 
book is irreproachable.

on Japan. ^ j^^^ ^^^y of contemporaneous 
events, but also of their historic and prehistoric 
causes and origins. Profoundly different, and 
startling by their contrast, are the methods of 
the late Lafcadio Heam, Avho was a human 
camera with a limitless supply of sensitive plates 
in the storehouse of his nature, and of Dr. Henry 
Dyer, a hard-headed, thick-skinned Scotchman, 
Avho states all that he sees and knows in terms 
of plainest common sense. This latest book on 
Japan — * Dai Nippon, a Study in National Evo- 
lution '— belongs to the literature of knowledge, 
and will interest especially those who like unem- 
broidered facts and plenty of statistics and 



tables, and who hate anything like ' fine Avriting,' 
eloquence, or ' gush.' Dr. Dyer did a noble work 
in establishing the College of Engineering in 
Japan in the seventies; and his monument may 
be beheld not only in the title * Emeritus Profes- 
sor Imperial University ' of Tokio, and in the 
bronze bust upon a column which his Japanese 
admirers have raised in his honor, but also in 
the superb material results visible in the army, 
navy, railways, factories, and multifarious oper- 
ations in Japan. At the end of each of his 
twenty chapters he gives a bibliography; but in 
his text he quotes entirely too much fi*om Pro- 
fessor Chamberlain and other British writers, 
thus revealing his limitations on the ideal side 
of life. The style of the book is pragmatic, and 
not calculated to thrill; but in one point Dr. 
Dyer has excelled all other writers on Japan. 
He shows clearly and forcibly, as well as copi- 
ously, what the great aimy of Yatoi, hired assist- 
ants and salaried organizers and advisers, in the 
days of their youth and strength thirty years 
ago, did for the Japanese in raising their ideals 
and pointing the way to future success. In cer- 
tain chapters,— like those on the fall of Feud- 
alism, the Japanese Mind, Transition, Education, 
etc.,— Dr. Dyer shows little acquaintance with 
the native literature or history apart from what 
one can pick up by reading foreign books; but 
his other chapters, on Industrial Developments, 
Art Industries, Commerce, Administration, and 
Finance, are handled in a bold and masterly 
Avay. Like all who have served the Japanese 
longest as co-Avorkers and brothers in sympathy, 
Dr, Dyer scouts the idea of any ' yelloAV peril.' 
He finds more to dread in the future from the 
royal and imperial pharisees of Europe than 
from anything likely to arise from Jaj^an or 
China. There is a good map, Avith appendices, 
bibliography, and an index. The book is printed 
on good honest English paper, and is imported 
into this country by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. Alas for publishers' ignoi-ance of Jap- 
anese imperial susceptibility! As in the cases 
of Dr. Gulick's and Lafcadio Hearn's latest 
books, the publishers of this one Avill doubtless 
find that any book Avith the sixteen-petalled 
chrysanthemum on its cover is not alloAA-ed to be 
sold publicly in the Japanese Empire.

has been the aim of Prof. Maynard M. Metcalf 
in his * Outline of the Theory of Organic Evolu- 
tion ' (Macmillan). The book is the outgrowth 
of a series of lectures given to the classes in 
biology at the Woman's College of Baltimore, 
and consequently the author has had the advant- 
age ofl>eing able by actual trial to adapt his 
matter to the comprehension of those not espe- 
cially trained in the biological sciences. The plan

followed in the treatment of the subject is some- 
what different from that which has become con- 
ventional in popular lectures and treatises on 
evolution. The first half of the book, roughly 
speaking, is occupied with a very condensed out- 
line of the theoiy of organic evolution as it is 
held by the majority of biologists at the present 
time, together with a brief account of some of 
the more important objections that have been 
urged against it. The stock evidence usually 
adduced in its support is presented separately 
in the second half of the book under the head- 
ing ' The Phenomena Explained by the Theory.' 
Aside from this departure in the grouping of the 
material, the treatment does not differ essen- 
tially from that usually followed bj* popular 
writers on the subject. An excellent account is 
given of the principal facts regai'ding coloration 
in animals. One of the concluding sections is 
■devoted to the relation of man to evolution, in 
which the author earnestly urges the importance 
of educating public opinion to the necessity of 
attention to those principles of good breeding, 
in the literal sense, which are essential to true 
evolutionary progress in the human si>eeies. Two 
features of the book are especially praiseworthy : 
first, the clearness and distinctness with which 
essentials are presented; second, the wealth of 
illustration. It is safe to say that no previous 
popular treatise on evolution has been so com- 
pletely and so well illustrated as this. The fact 
that the figures are for the most part copied 
fi'om other sources necessitates a considerable 
A'ariation in their quality, but the occasional 
shortcomings in the matter of quality are amply 
compensated for by quantity. The chief criti- 
cism to be made regarding the book as a whole 
is its failure to give any adequate account of 
the important results of many of the recent 
investigations in the field of " evolution. One 
especially misses an account of the results of 
the application of statistical methods to the 
problems in this field. With the exception of 
the book admirably meets the need for a popular 
this single marked defect, we can but feel that, 
and accurate account of the theory of organic 
evolution,

AtJantic essays. "On to secure a wide readmg for 
Mr. Bliss Perrj"'s volume of 
essays, ' The Amateur Spirit ' (Houghton. 
Mifflin & Co.), Indeed, they are already well 
known from haA-ing appeared originally in * The 
Atlantic Monthly '— with one exception, ' The 
Life of a College Professor,' which was printed 
in * Scribner's ' before the writer had exchanged 
the professor's for the editor's chair. His title- 
chapter balances, in a keenly appreciative and 
discriminating manner, the conflicting claims of 
amateurism and professionalism in the great 
business of life, and leaves us to hope with the 
author that * this combination of qualities, this 
union of the generous spirit of the amateur with 
the method of the professional,' is not an impos- 
sible ideal. The second essay deals with a quality 
quite opposed to that of the amateur, the lover,— 
indifferentism. Voltaire's Sismor Pococurante is 



made to serve as type of the indifferentist, if 
the word may be allowed. The author's search 
for those subtle elements in character and train- 
ing that produce ' pococurantism ' in all its 
varied forms fails, apparently, to hit on what 
would seem to be a not infrequent cause,— 
exalted idealism combined with a too insistent 
consciousness of the yawning gap forever sepa- 
rating conception and realization. Perhaps, how- 
ever, he would make the resultant discourage- 
ment and listlessness merely another form of 
ttat weakness of the will which he names, or 
of the hypercritical temperament which he also 
recognizes. The chapter on ' Hawthorne at 
North Adams ' is admirable, written as it is by 
a true lover and skilful interpreter of Haw- 
thorne, and also a native of that rugged little 
comer of Massachusetts dominated by Greylock 
Mountain and the Hoosac and Taconic ranges. 
The six short studies as a whole reveal a certain 
fine artistic detachment in the writer's nature. 
He has something of Signor Pococurante in him, 
and also a suflSeient infusion of Candide. both 
of them characters for whom he manifests a 
liking. In short, to apply to hjm words of his 
own, he is one of the * speculative, amused, 
imdeluded children of this world.' Sanity, bal- 
ance, kindliness, unite with insight and imagina- 
tion to give his pages their peculiar charm. 



Wellington, In the series of biographical 
and England's studies which concems itself with 
military power. ^Yie lives and characters of the 
great worthies of history, and is called ' The 
Heroes of the Nations ' (Putnam), the latest 
volume is given to a survey of the career of 
Wellington, by Mr. William O'Connor Morris. 
The book takes the form and scope made familiar 
to us by the preceding volumes of the series; 
and the aim of the editors,— to select characters 
* about whom have gathered the great traditions 
of the nations to which they belonged, and who 
have been accepted, in many instances, as types 
of the several national ideals,' — has been abun- 
dantly realized in the choice of Wellington. The 
sub-title, too, — ' the revival of the miUtaiy power 
of England'— is suggestive of the identifica- 
tion of the period with the man. Judge O'Con- 
nor Morris seemed especially fitted for his task 
by his exhaustive researches for his earlier suc- 
cessful work on ' The Campaigns of 1815 ': and 
the fact that ten of the thirteen chapters of the 
present book are devoted to Wellington's mili- 
tary career, while only three describe his polit- 
ical life, is fairly indicative of the relative 
importance of these two periods to English his- 
tory. In his estimate of the Duke's achieve- 
ments, Judge Morris does full justice to his 
great opponents Napoleon and Soult, while pro- 
testing against the extravagance of Napier's 
eulogies on both these captains; and he concedes 
Wellington's inferiority in strategy to * the 
greatest of strategists,' while claiming for him 
the merit of being *a comsummate leader of men 
in battle, which largely atoned for imdoubted 
strategic errors,' The book is well indexed, and 
abundantly supplied with apparatus of maps,

principal revivals. Sj>ecial attention has been 
given to the stage^history of Shakespeare's plays 
and other classics of dramatic literature. Mr. 
Adams's Dictionary will prove invaluable to stu- 
dents of the drama. Being an English work, 
however, considerable more attention is given 
to English histrionic nomenclature than to Amei-- 
ican; for instance, Charles Frohman, America's 
leading theatrical entrepreneur is merely 
referred to as follows : ' Charles Frohman became 
lessee of the Duke of York's Theatre, London, in 
1897.' This would hardlj'^ prove satisfactory 
to an American student in search of historical 
or biographical data. The work is divided into 
two parts, the present being Volume I., A— G. 
The second volume is promised for early issue. 

A new As fine specimens of the art of 

Oriental the Oriental rug-weaver become 

Rug-book. rarer and their market price 

advances, the literature about them grows more 
voluminous, as might naturally be expected. The 
latest addition to the list of works dealing with 
the subject is Mrs. Mary Churchill Ripley's 
' Oriental Rug Book ' (F. A. Stokes Co.). In 
her desire to be thorough the author has gone far 
afield in search of information. Every page 
bears witness to painstaking investigation, and to 
earnest effort to answer all questions that may 
be asked. But excess of enthusiasm has its 
dangers. Though the book contains much that 
is new and of value, the useful items are so over- 
laid by a liberal embroidery of irrelevant matter 
that their separation from the overcharged con- 
text is attended with some difficulty, notwith- 
standing the aid afforded by the chart with its 
columns entwined with * flowers of thought.' 
Such information as that given on page 57 con- 
cerning tests for determining the age of rugs. 



and the explanation on page 110 of the way the 
mottled effect of the centres of antique Ghiorde& 
rugs was produced, will be appreciated by every 
lover of these beautiful fabrics. Excellent, too, 
is the advice to become thoroughly acquainted 
with methods and materials before attempting 
to draw conclusions from the patterns employed,, 
and in studying the latter to avoid ' all effort to 
force the eye to see what does not exist, and to 
twist the designs of adventition into those that 
shoAV deliberate intention.' Pattern, however, is- 
a topic fascinating to the author, who fairly 
revels in the reading-in of meanings against 
which she warns others. Her point of view is- 
shown in the absurd definition, ' ornament is 
decoration that has evolved from patterns that 
were based on symbols used by primitive peoples- 
to express thought.' And so, in addition to con- 
stant references here and there, she devotes a 
whole chapter to ' Legends and Myths that 
may be illustrated by designs in rugs.' (The 
italics are ours.) Despite its discursiveness, the 
book has substantial merit, though its usefulness 
would be much greater if it could be stripped of 
some of its redundant verbiage. The illustra- 
tions, eight of which are in color, deserve special 
comm,endation because of the typical character 
of the rugs selected for reproduction. 



The late Professor Alexander 
onhemFnd Gain's Autobiography (Longmans,. 
emn . Green & Co.) will undoubtedly be 
a disappointment to the reader who is looking for 
literaay charm or for any strong infusion of the 
human interest. It is a dry, concise chronicle, 
in which first place is given to facts about the 
Avriter's own scientific activity and published 
work,— professedly a record of his intellectual 
history first of all. As such it will add something 
—perhaps not very much— to our knowledge of 
the particular doctrines with Avhich Professor 
Bain's name is connected; but the wider interest 
that belongs to a revelation of inner conflict, and 
emotional response to the problems of life, is- 
almost wholly lacking. The narrative parts are 
more particularly disappointing. Famous names- 
meet us frequently in his pages; but it is usually 
in the way of colorless statements, Avhich give 
little sense of the men themselves. Perhaps as- 
vivid a touch as any is the account of a meeting 
in Paris with Comte, and the desci-iption 
of the famous philosopher, with his short, 
paunchy figure, round cropped head, and 
hard features, his bright colored di*essing 
gOAvn, his moods of abstraction alternating Avith 
vehement and magniloquent monologue. ' I may 
say again, with regard to Comte, that I never 
knew or could imagine such a case of the nega- 
tion of humor. His whole attitude Avas that of 
severe denunciation or self-aggrandisement, and 
his only smile was a giin. ' However, to him AA-ho 
can appreciate it, and who does not ask for what 
there is no pretense of giving, the book has a 
certain power in spite of (perhaps to some extent 
of account of) its severity of ti-eatment and lack 
of extraneous charm. Personally one may not 
find either the temperament or the philosophy

of Professor Bain altogether attractive. But no 
one can deny a tribute of respect and admiration 
to the fearless, straightforward, clear-thinking 
personality, who, by sheer force of hard work, 
praxitical good judgment, and intellectual acumen, 
at last attained for himself the influential posi- 
tion from which prejudices and cliques were so 
long successful in debarring him. 

mtrmtworthy A book devoted to facts and fig- 
information ures and statistics may be forgiven 
<ibout Italy. f^j. ^gt being entertaining, but it 
cannot be forgiven for being inaccurate, or, if 
offered in a new edition or new translation, for 
being out-of-date. Deecke's * Italy ' (Macmil- 
lan), recently translated by Mr. H. A. Nesbitt, 
is a large octavo volume of nearly 500 pages, 
mainly devoted to such subjects as Geology, Pop- 
ulation, History, Commerce, Political Institu- 
tions, etc.,— only one of its sixteen chapters 
ti-eating of the things for which Italy chiefly 
stands in the minds of most persons, its Art, 
Language, and Science. That the book is dull is 
thei-efore not surprising; but that it is also full 
of errors is both surprising and inexcusable. 
Even so simple a matter as the topography of 
Rome contains blunders obvious to the most casual 
visitor. For example, two errors occur in a 
single paragraph (p. 392) : the statue of Gior- 
dano Bruno is wrongly placed in the Piazza 
Navoua (indeed, an earlier page of this same 
book locates it correctly in Campo di Fiori), and 
the dome of the Pantheon is alluded to as * the 
glorious dome built by Agrippa.' Now it has 
been a matter of common knowledge, settled by 
unquestionable evidence a dozen years ago, that 
Adrian, and not Agrippa, was the builder of the 
Pantheon dome, its portico only dating from the 
time of Agrippa. The picture of the Roman 
Forum is fully five years out-of-date, showing 
conspicuously a row of modem houses long since 
pulled down from its northern border which for- 
merly concealed the beautiful ruins of the Basil- 
ica Emilia, the pavement of the Sacred Way, 
and the ancient Sepulcretum of pre-historic 
Rome now to be seen there. And when was it 
ever time of this spot (certainly it is not true 
now) that it appears a * miserable desert where 
at most a couple of inquiring foreigners or bored 
sight-seers are wandering about '? On the con- 
trary, it is the enthusiasm and the large numbers 
of sight-seers,— students, and lecturers with 
classes in their trail,— which one is sure to 
encounter there at any hour of the day and any 
season of the year, that is the chief drawback 
to one's enjoyment of this classic spot. If the 
book is no more trustworthy in its imposing 
tables of statistics than in these simple every- 
day matters, it is certainly not to be regarded 
as an authoritv. 



The latest 
tiography 
of Lincoln 



Dr. Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer has 
undertaken to arrange for a series 
of biographies, twenty-five in num- 
ber, of the men who had to do in one way or 
another with the American Civil War, from 
Webster and Benton to Jay Cooke. Competent 



men are to write the books, Southern men those 
giving the Southern side, and Northern men the 
other. The series is to be known as ' The Ameri- 
can Crisis Biographies,' and is to be published 
by Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. The editor 
has opened the series with a life of Abraham 
Lincoln, a book of about the size of the single- 
volume bi(^raphies of the * American Statesmen 
Series,' and following much the same plan. At 
first thought, one wonders why another life of 
Lincoln of this kind should be written, for there 
are already several excellent short biographies 
of * the first American. ' But the series demanded 
it, and the author has produced a well-balanced, 
readable, compact book, that gives the important 
facts of Lincoln's life, and shows him as pos- 
terity will be likely to see him, not as a demigod, 
but with full appreciation of his character and 
genius. Belonging to a later generation, the 
author is free from the bias that is inevitable 
in one who lived near the days of the war; and he 
has brought to his work historical training and a 
practised hand. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Isaac Hull Piatt 's volume on Walt Whitman 
is the latest issue of the 'Beacon Biographies' of 
eminent Americans, published by Messrs. Small, 
Maynard & Co. Like its predecessors in this trim 
and attractive series, the biography is selective 
and compact, consisting of less than 150 pages all 
told, yet remarkably complete and clear in its 
detsiils. The author is a lover of his poet; but his 
presentation in this essay is so sane and so wholly 
free from extravagances that it is quite likely to 
win the heart of an unprejudiced reader. Indeed 
as a quiet, straightforward, sympathetic appreci- 
ation and interpretation of 'the good gray poet,' 
this little volume is altogether worth while. The 
internal arrangement of the book includes a chron- 
ology and full bibliography, and there is a portrait. 

'The Works of Daniel Defoe,' in sixteen volumes, 
edited by Prof. Gustavus H. Maynadier, are pub- 
lished by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. This 
is the 'first complete edition of the writings of 
the first great realist.' We cannot help won- 
dering how many readers of average general intel- 
ligence could name off-hand enough of the 'works' 
of Defoe to account for even half of the number of 
volumes. 'Bobinson Crusoe' fills three of them, 
'Moll Flanders,' 'Colonel Jaeque' and 'The Fortun- 
ate Mistress' two each, and the other seven contain 
single works and collections. Each volume has an 
etched frontispiece and a special editorial introduc- 
tion, and the set is sold at a very moderate price. 
The editor, who is already responsible for similar 
editions of Fielding and Smollett, is a competent 
authority upon eighteenth century literature, and 
has done his work with commendable scholarship. 

Two new volumes in 'Newnes' Art Library* 
(Wame) are devoted respectively to Kaphael and 
Constable's Sketches. They are made up, like the 
previous volumes of the series, of a brief mono- 
graph upon the life and art of the painter, followed 
by about sixty half-tone reproductions of his works. 
The binding is in paper boards with vellum back. 
Mr. Edgecumbe StaJey furnishes the prefatory notes 
for the volume on Kaphael, in this case chiefly 
biographical, and a list of his principal works, with 
their present locations. 'The Betrothal of the Vir-

gin' in the Brera is reproduced in photogravure as 
a frontispiece. Sir James D. Linton, R.I., writes of 
Constable's life and art, explaining the character- 
istics of his landscapes and the importance, towards 
a true understanding of his art, of the drawings, 
sketches, and studies in the South Kensington 
Collection, which is the basis of the present volume. 

'Government and the Citizen,' by Mr, Roscoe 
Lewis Ashlej', is a simple text-book of civil govern- 
ment, illustrated, and furnished with text questions 
upon the several chapters. Mr. Ashley's two larger 
works for mature students of the subject are favor- 
ably known, and many teachers will be glad that 
he has now added to the series a book fitted for the 
grammar schools. The Macmillan Co. publish the 
volume. 

'Reminiscences of Hoboken Academy' (E. Steiger 
& Co.), by Mr. Robert Waters, formerly one of its 
teachers, but now superintendent of the West 
Hoboken schools, is a brochure of seventy pages, 
packed full of enthusiasm and loyalty for the old 
academy, and breathing a high-spirited devotion to 
the things of the mind and the heart that does one 
good to encounter. Though written primarily at 
the request of graduates of the academy, and of 
chief interest to them, Mr. Waters 's pleasant little 
pamphlet will prove unusually interesting even to 
the general reader. 

The subscription edition of 'The Novels and 
Stories of Ivan Tourguenieff, ' published by the 
Messrs. Scribner, is at last complete in sixteen vol- 
umes, and we have to congratulate those respon- 
sible for the enterprise upon the extremely satis- 
factory way in which they have performed their 
task. Here at last we have the entire work in 
fiction of perhaps the greatest of all novelists 
presented in admirable English and in beautiful 
mechanical form. Miss Hapgood's introductions to 
the several volumes are of great value for their 
presentation of the Russian critical estimate of the 
author. Volumes XIV, to XVI., now published, 
include 'Spring Freshets,' thirteen short stories, 
and the exquisite 'Poems in Prose.' 

Mr. Henry T. Finck's editing of 'Fifty Songs of 
Franz Schubert,' which he has just done for the 
'Musician's Library' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & 
Co., has been conspicuously a work of love, and this 
is by no means the first occasion upon which he has 
expressed (and imparted to others) his enthusiastic 
appreciation of 'the greatest of the song-writers.' 
Indeed, when we look through this collection, 
ranging from the 'Gretchen am Spinnrade' of 1814 
to the 'Am Meer' of 1828, we do not find much 
difficulty in agreeing with his view that in these 
fifty songs 'there is as much genius, and almost as 
much variety' as in the editor's earlier collection 
of 'Fifty Mastersongs by Twenty Composers,' 
included in the same series of volumes. 

The eighteenth annual volume of the English 
'Book-Prices Current,' covering the auction season 
of 1903-1904, has recently been sent us by the 
publisher, Mr. Elliot Stock of London. So long 
have the accuracy and inclusiveness of this stand- 
ard reference work been established that its value 
requires no further emphasis at this time. With its 
American prototype, it should find place on the 
shelves of every well-ordered public library. From 
the compiler's introduction, we learn that the sea- 
son covered in this latest volume was by no means 
satisfactory to the trade. While the real treasures 
of the book-world have held their own fairly well, 
the ordinary items that make up the bulk of the 
sales have shown a falling off of from thirty to 
forty per cent., as compared to what they have 
brought in years of happier commercial conditions.

A new novel by Mr. S. Weir Mitchell and the 
Hon. Andrew D. White's autobiography and remin- 
iscences are scheduled for March publication by 
the Century Co. 

A volume devoted to Chaucer, under the editor- 
ship of Prof. Fred Norris Robinson, is being pre- 
pared for Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.'s well- 
known series of 'Cambridge Poets.' 

Mrs. Humphry W^ard 's latest novel, ' The Mar- 
riage of William Ashe,' now appearing serially in 
'Harper's Magazine,' will be issued in book form 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers earh^ in March. 

Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. publish 'In the Days 
of Shakespeare,' by Mr. Tudor Jenks, a pleasant 
book for young readers, in the manner of the 
author's recent book about Chaucer and his times. 

Dr. Lyman Abbott's recent sermon at Harvard 
University, which has provoked widespread discus- 
sion, is soon to be published by Messrs. Thomas Y. 
Crowell & Co. in a booklet entitled 'God in His 
World.' 

A volume of 'Historical Tales: The Romance of 
Reality,' by Mr. Charles Morris, is published by 
the J. B. Lippincott Co. The subjects of the tales 
are Spanish- American; the language is simple, and 
the book has illustrations. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. republish, in a neat 
uniform set of four volumes, their books by the 
late Lafcadio Hearn. The titles are, 'A Japanese 
Miscellany,' 'Shadowings, ' 'Exotics and Retrospec- 
tives,' and 'In Ghostly Japan.' 

'Four American Indians,' by Mr. Edson L. Whit- 
ney and Miss Frances M. Perry, is a reading book 
for schools published by the American Book Co. 
King Philip, Pontiac, Tecumseh, and Osceola are 
the respective subjects of the biographies. 

Messrs. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co. publish a neat 
volume containing the 'Inaugural Addresses of the 
Presidents of the LTnited States from Washington 
to Lincoln,' edited by Mr. John Vance Cheney. 
This is the second volume of the ' Lakeside Classics * 
issued by this house. 

The new 'Garden Magazine,' published by Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co., makes an excellent begin- 
ning with its February number; text, illustrations, 
and typography being all of the best. The period- 
ical will doubtless speedily make itself indispensable 
to those whose special interests it serves. 

'The Planting of a Nation in the New World' is 
the title of the first volume in Prof. Edward Chan- 
ning's long-promised History of the United States. 
This volume will be issued by the Macmillan Co. 
within a month or two, and the remaining seven 
volumes will appear at intervals thereafter. 

The recent developments in Russia lend unusual 
timeliness to Mr. A. Cahan's novel 'The White 
Terror and the Red,' announced for immediate pub- 
lication by Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. The book 
is said to present a dramatic picture of internal 
affairs in the Czar's domain, written from the point 
of view of a member of the Revolutionary party. 

The 'A. L. A. Catalog' (sic), in its new form, 
extended to include eight thousand volumes, is a 
work of great usefulness, and the Library of Con- 
gress deserves the warmest thanks for having under- 
taken its publication and distribution at a nominal 
price. It has two parts in one; the former a classi- 
fied enumeration, and the latter a dictioiiary cata- 
logue of the best modern type. Since Mr. Melvil 
Dewey is the editor (with the assistance of Miss

system of classification is the basis of the work. 
It is an invaluable guide for the small public 
library, the school library, and the general reader 
in search of the best books upon any particular 
subject. 

A popular cloth-bound edition of 'A Eose of Nor- 
mandy, ' by Mr. William E. A. Wilson, has just been 
added by Messrs, Little, Brown, & Co. to their popu- 
lar fiction series. Mr. Wilson has written another 
romance, entitled *A Knot of Blue,' for spring 
publication. 

Among the authors to be represented on the 
spring list of Messrs. Houghton, Mifliin & Co. are 
Mrs. Elizabeth Eobins Pennell, the Bishop of Eipon, 
Mr. Alleyne Ireland, Dr. C. Hanford Henderson, 
Prof. Charles S. Sargent, Mrs. Mary Austin, Dr. 
Lyman Abbott, and Prof. George H. Palmer. 

Prof. Lewis Campbell has recently completed a 
volume on the Tragic Drama in Aeschylus, Sopho- 
cles, and Shakespeare, the purpose of which, he says, 
is to invite attention to the essential points of 
correspondence between the great masterpieces of 
Athens and of Elizabethan England. Messrs. Long- 
mans, Green, & Co. will publish the book. 

'The Principles and Progress of English Poetry,' 
by Professor C. M. Gayley, is published by the 
Macmillan Co. It is essentially a book of texts, 
from Chaucer to Tennyson, although the amount 
of apparatus is considerable, and although there 
is an introductory study of a hundred pages on ' The 
Principles of Poetry.' Mr. Clement C. Young has 
collaborated with Professor Grayley in the prepara- 
tion of this work. 

Twelve volumes of the 'Kensington' Thackeray, 
just sent to us by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, 
complete the thirty-two volumes of this dignified 
and almost monumental library edition of the great 
novelist. We have praised it so highly as the 
several volumes have from time to time appeared, 
that little now remains to be said beyond recording 
our satisfaction that the work is complete. The 
new plates made by Mr. DeYinne, the fine quality 
of paper and bindiiig, the care given to producing 
a comprehensive and accurate text, and the abun- 
dance of the illustrations, are features that speak 
for themselves, and make this edition highly satis- 
factory. The Brcokfield letters are now for the 
first time included in a complete Thackeray, and 
a list of characters is now for the first time made.

Extract from paper, " The Selection and Use of Periodicals," read before the Ohio Library Association at 
Findlay, Ohio, May 26th : 

The usefulness of the magazines is greatly increased by a periodical index. The 
consolidation of the Cumulative Index with the Readers' Guide leaves practically 
only one in the field — the Readers' Guide. The plan of this, cumulating for the 
three, six, nine and twelve months, is a great improvement over the Cumulative. 
It is prompt in its issue and invaluable in the reference room.

"The Dial" has always stood for character. It has 
the old Puritan conscience on which everything that is 
lasting in our country is built. It is sane, wise, truthful ; 
it is honest, hopeful, and kindly, and with all this it is the

cism which we have, and we

HARPERS' NEW PUBLICATIONS 



The American Nation 

A History from Original Sources, by Associated Scholars 

IN TWENTY-EIGHT VOLUMES. 
Edited by ALBERT BUSHNELL HART, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of History at Harvard 
'PHIS work is the grreatest, most aathoritative, and only exhaostiyely complete history of America that has ever 
been undertaken. The work is under the editorial supervision of Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor of History at 
Harvard University, in consultation with advisory committees appointed by the Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas, and 
Wisconsin Historical Societies. The history will be complete in twenty-eight volumes, each the work of an acknowl- 
edged historical scholar who is a specialist in that period of our nation's history of which his volume treats. The 
names of these scholars are an assurance of the authority, finality, and permanence of the work. The plan of the 
narrative is chronological, the volumes following each other in close sequence, and its scope a critical, political, 
biographical account of the events and forces which have been vital in the making of our nation. Five volumes are 
now ready, and the remaining volumes will follow quickly. This first group of five is complete in itself.

The Wonders of Life 

By ERNEST HAECKEL 
Author of " The Riddle of the Universe." 

THE great success of The Riddle of the Universe, and 
the innumerable letters asking for more knowledge 
to supplant that of the Riddle, have led the author to 
write this present volume. In the earlier book Professor 
Haeckel made a comprehensive survey of the general 
questions of science as they concerned the whole universe, 
in the light of monistic philosophy. But in The Wonders 
of Life the author has confined himself to organic science. 



The Land of Riddles 

{RUSSIA OF TO-DAY) 
By HUGO GANZ 

ANEW book about Russia, of rare timeliness, that 
should not be overlooked by any one who is interested 
in the Eastern crisis. It gives a picture of the interior 
and the political and social conditions of the country such 
as has never before been drawn. Hugo Ganz is a Viennese 
writer of ability, who has had unusual opportunities for 
making a keen and intimate study of the Czar's country 



or the science of life. The object of this book is, he says, : and bringing it down to date. Among other topics, the late 



the construction of a rational and solid philosophy/ of life. It 
is a book likely to mark an epoch in philosophical thought.

The Complete Poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne 

Now, after thirty-six years, Swinburne himself has edited and arranged in form to last for all time his complete 
poetical works, including almost a whole volume of new, unpublished verse. And in addition he has written a 
long prefatory note setting forth his theory of poetry and of the beautiful in life. Swinburne is ondoabtedly the 
greatest living poet. To possess his complete works should be a joy and a distinction.

important Snnka for IGtbrart^a 



Seager's INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS 

By Professor HENRY ROGERS SEAGER, of Colnmbia. 560 pp., Syo. Price, $2.00 net. 

The author treats of the principles of Economies in vital rdation to the facts and problems of business life. 

F. H. DIXOX, Professor in Dartmouth College : " Prof eaaor Seager baa written what is probably the best text-book on the elementt e/ ee0nomics 
that hat yet appeared. . . . The feature of the book is the exhauatiTe treatment of the subject of distribution, to which eight chapters are 
devoted. The mental balance of the writer is here moat evident, for in spite of bis Anatrian training, he finds himself unable to follow th 
Austrian writers in their extreme poaitions. His acceptance of much of the thinlring of the classical school in combination with the more 
conservatiTe portions of modem theory, results in a prasentation which, far from being wmTeiing and indefinite, as one might fear, is c<Miaistent, 
sane, and satisfying." 

THE NIBELUNGENLIED 

Translated into rhymed verse in the metre of the original by Dr. Georgb Henrt Needueb, of University College, Toronto. 

Gilt top, oS-T pp. 12mo. $1.75 net (by mail, §1.87). 

Prof. H. C. 6. BRAXDT, Hamilton College, Clinton, X. Y.: "It is the best English translation, without question. The translator abows his 
good judgment when he retains the original strope, the characteriatic laat half-verse with its four ictus included. That a Germanist could write 
an introduction of only thir^-wx pages to such a much-discussed epic will be a marvel to his fellows. Bat it oontaios all the general reader 
wants and needs to know." 



Nivedita's 
WEB OF INDIAN LIFE 

300pp., 8vo, S2.25net. (By mail,$2.o6.) 
A book by a woman who has lived 
in the Hindu quarter of Calcutta, as a 
member of an Indian Sisterhood. The 
book is chiefly devoted to the Eastern 
woman, but also treats at length of 
the Indian Sagas, the Caste system, 
the Synthesis of Indian Thought. 

" A setting forth of the institutions, 
customs, and beliefs of the people of 
India that gives the Hindus' side 
. . . the spirit of the book is trans- 
parently informed with her exalted 
simplicity of purpose to tell the very 
truth and the inner truth. . . . We 
only cite enough to excite a whole- 
some desire on the part of open- 
minded American students to see 
what is to be said by one irAo faith- 
fully wtrkt herulf into the very tkin 
of the devout Oriental." 

— Botton Tranteript. 



PEDAGOGUES AND PARENTS 

By Ijlla Calista Wilson. Gilt top, 290 pp. 
§1.25 net. (By mail, $1..37.) 

A discussion of schools and education, actaal 
and ideal, and of some of the older educational 
classics. Familiar with the latest methods of 
teachers, the author has clearly and wittily 
presented the views and protests of parents. 

"So rich in apt quotation, so sparkling, and so 
original that the reader cannot fail to be fasci- 
nated." — N. Y. Times Review. 

" Considered purely as literature and esti- 
mating it by the solace, stimnlns and high satis- 
faction it imparts, it has been many a day since 
we met its superior. Most books appeal to a 
special constituency : this one may well have 
many constituencies." — Christian Register.

"Will repay perusal by every 
thoughtful business man. . . Pre- 
senting in a forceful and attractive 
manner the importance of the Pacific 
as the future field for the world's 
political and commercial activity." 

— Philadelphia Ledger 



Angell's PSYCHOLOGY 

By Professor James Rowlakd Asgeix, of the Univeimty 

of Chicago. 402 pp. 8vo. $1..50. 

This book is written in the belief that psychology has now reached a 
p<Mnt where students may advantageously be given a more distinctly 
functional and genetic account of mental processes than has hitherto 
been feasible. The point of view adopted is one from which it is felt 
that the truest impressions are to be gained of the practical workings 
of consciousness. 

"I know of no similar book that has so successfully brought the 
results of modem physiological and experimental methods in psychology 
to bear upon the problems of mind." — Jobs K. Rttssku., Professor of 
Psychology in WiUiamt College.

Translated by Gray Casement. 

Many illustrations from photographs of the place

In one sense an unique book. Mr. Casement 
has chosen ten of Senor Guardia's delightful 
contes dealing with love and religion, adventures 
and politics, and for the first time presents 
them to English readers. Filled alternately with 
Spanish languor and Castilian fire, each one of 
the tales holds the reader's interest from the 
beginning. Not the least important portion of 
the volume is the translator's excellent intro- 
duction, telling more of the place and people in 
an admirable way than can be found elsewhere 
after the most exhaustive search.

A POETS RETROSPECT. 



The great English poet who is now approach- 
ing his seventieth year, and who remains the 
solitary sumvor in the twentieth century of 
the great group of nineteenth-oentury poets with 
whom he is associated, is now engaged in super- 
intending a uniform republication of his poet- 
ical writing. Since these writings occupy 
twenty-four volumes of various sizes, since they 
are expensive and in some cases out of print, 
and since they are, neveri;heless, indispensable 
to every lover of poetry, it is a cause for thank- 
fulness that all of them will soon be obtainable 
in a shape both uniform and definitive. The 
lyrical section of this new edition is already 
complete and in the hands of the public; the 
dramatic section, we are assured, will soon 
follow. 

In addition to the debt under which Mr. 
Swinburne has thus placed us, we have also to 
thank him for having seized this occasion to 
take us iato his confidence by publishing a retro- 
spective view of his poetical activity, which has 
now extended over nearly half a century. How- 
ever clearly a poet may reveal himself in his 
writings, there is always a peculiar satisfaction 
in the supplementary sort of revelation that is 
offered when he deigns to tell us something of 
their liistory, and to give us some glimpse of the 
light ia which they present themselves to his 
own consciousness. This is what Mr. Swin- 
burne has now done in the lengthy ' dedicatory 
epistle ' which inscribes his collected poems to 
his 'best and dearest friend.' It is no doubt 
true that a poet is not always the best judge of 
his own poems, and Mr. Swinburne is as likely 
as others to err in this respect, but the interest 
of such self-criticism as he gives us is not to be 
questioned, and we cannot help wishing that 
Tennyson and Browning had likewise left U6 
some similar subjective measure wherewith to 
test our own objective estimate of their work. 

In an introductory paragraph Mr. Swinburne 
sets forth his theory of the poefs attitude 
toward his public in this matter of appraise- 
ment and explanation, 

*It is impossible for any man to undertake the 
task of commentary, however brief and succinct, on 
anything he has done or tried to do, without 
incurring the charge of egoism. But there are 
two kinds of egoism, the furtive and the frank: 
and the outspoken and open-hearted candour of 
Milton and Wordsworth, Comeille and Hugo, is not 
the least or the lightest of their claims to the 
regard as well as the respect or the reverence of 



112 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



their readers. . . . Whether i|fc is worth while 
for any man to oflfer any remarksj or for any other 
man to read his remarks on his own works, his own 
ambition, or his own attempts, he cannot of course 
determine. If there are great examples of absti- 
nence from such a doubtful enterprise, there are 
likewise gi-eat examples to the contrary. As long as 
the writer can succeed in evading the kindred 
charges and the cognate risks of vanity and humility, 
there can be no reason why he should not undertake 
it. And when he has nothing to regret and nothing 
to recant, when he finds nothing that he could wish 
to cancel, to alter, or to unsay, in any page he ha* 
ever laid before his reader, he need not be seriously 
troubled by the inevitable consciousness that the 
work of his early youth is not and cannot be unnat- 
urally unlike the work of a very young man.' 

In other words, Mr. Swinburne says again, from 
the vantage point of his mature years, what he 
said of the Toems and Ballads' when they 
Avere published in 1866, that they were ' bom of 
boy's pastime,' that they were not such poems 
as a man would write, but that, allowing for the 
limitations and the exuberance of youth, they 
were produced in all artistic sincerity. He has 
told us since, in imperishably beautiful verse, 
how his life outgrew that boyish phase of riot- 
ous imaginings, how he rode *the red ways of 
the revel through,' 

'Till on some winter's dawn of some dim year 
He let the vine-bit on the panther's lip 
Slide, and the green rein slip, 
And set his eyes to seaward,' 

and how, in the end, 

'The sweet sea's breath 
Breathed and blew life in where was heartless death. 
Death spirit-stricken of soul-sick days, where strife 
Of thought and flesh make mock of death and life, 
And grace returned upon him.' 

The critics have long since recovered from 
the hysteria which overcame them when they 
first sought to pass judgment on the ' Poems 
and Ballads,' and they hardly need now to be 
reminded that the dramatic studies contained 
in that volume were neither confessions of a 
vicious personal experience nor exercises of an 
unregulated imagination. 

'There are photographs from life in the book; 
and there are sketches from imagination. Some 
which keen-sighted criticism has dismissed with a 
smile as ideal or imaginary were as real and actual 
as they well could be: Others which have been taken 
for obvious transcripts from memory were utterly 
fantastic or dramatic. If the two kinds cannot be 
distinguished, it is surely rather a credit than a 
discredit to an artist whose medium or material 
has more in common with a musician's than a 
sculptor 's. ' 

It was, as the author says, a ' quaint reception '" 
that the book received, and * the clatter aroused 
by it ' was to him a source of no little amuse- 
ment. 

Writing of his next book, the glorious * Songs 
before Sunrise,' Mr. Swinburne disclaims the 
notion that he was merely engaged in the task 



of translatingj 'Mazzini's gospel into verse. 
' Mazzini was no more a Pope or a Dictator than 
I was a parasite or a papist.' 'I never pre- 
tended,' he goes on to say, * to see eye to eye 
with my illustrious friends and masters, Victor 
Hugo and Giuseppe Mazzini, in regard to the 
positive and passionate confidence of their 
sublime and purified theology.' In this con- 
nection, the author gives us the keynote to all 
that he has ever written upon the two subjects 
of religion and politics. On the former theme 
he says: 

'That the spirit and the letter of all other than 
savage and barbarous religions are irreconcilably 
at variance, and that prayer or homage addressed 
to an image of our own or of other men's making, 
be that image avowedly material or conventionally 
spiritual, is the affirmation of idolatiy with aU 
its attendant atrocities, and the negation of all 
belief, all reverence, and all love, due to the noblest 
object of human wox-ship that humanity can realize 
or conceive.' 

These words are the rational basis upon which 
rest such poems as ' Ileriha,' ' Before a Cruci- 
fix,' the ' Hymn of Man,' and ' Tlie Altar of 
Eighteousness.' He claims consistency in his 
political doctrine when he says, comparing his 
later poems with the ' Songs before Sunrise,' 
that 

'Every passing, word I have since thought fit 
to utter on any national or political question has 
been as wholly consistent with the principles which 
I then did my best to proclaim and defend as any 
apostasy from the faith of all republicans in the 
fundamental and final principle of union, voluntary 
if possible and compulsory if not, would have been 
ludicrous in the impudence of its inconsistency with 
these simple and irreversible principles. Monarch- 
ists and anarchists may be advocates of national 
dissolution and reactionary division; republicans 
cannot be.' 

The poet then gives us a running commen- 
tary upon his dramatic verse, beginning with 
' The Queen Mother,' ' written while yet under 
academic or tutorial authority,' and acknowl- 
edging it to be imitative of the Elizabethan 
model. In ' Chastelard ' he thinks that ' some- 
thing of real and evident life' is discernible. 
' Bothwell ' he calls an 'epic drama,' and quotes 
Avith pardona])le pride the praise bestowed upon 
it by Hugo. 'Occuper ces deux cimes, cela 
n'est donne qu'a vous.' 'Mary Stuart' was 
coldly received by the public, but Sir Henry 
Taylor applauded it, and the author avows: 
^I think I have never written anything 
wortliier of such reward than the closing 
tragedy which may or may not have deserved 
but which certainly received it.' Of the two 
Greek plays, he thinks the 'Atalanta' too 
exuberant, effusive, and in-egular, and doubts 
whether the whole is greater than any part of 
it. 'The ' Ereehtheus ' he views with greater 
satisfaction, and this must surelv be the ver- 



1905.] 



THE DIAL,

diet of the critic who considers the two works 
in their entirety. Little is said of the four 
later plays, but the author is careful to remind 
us, in speaking of them, that he writes, like 
Charles Lamb, for antiquity. ' When I write 
plays it is with a view to their being acted at 
the Globe, the Red Bull, or the Black Friars.' 

Speaking of his hTical work, Mr. Swinburne 
gives the highest place, and justly, in our opin- 
ion, to the two great Pindaric odes, ' Athens ' 
and ' The Armada.' 

'By the test of these two poems I am content 
that my claims should be decided and my station 
determined as a h-ric poet in the higher sense of 
the term; a craftsman in the most ambitious line 
of his art that ever aroused or ever can arouse the 
emulous aspiration of his kind.' 

He happily characterizes and links together the 
' Hymn to Proserpine ' and the ' Hj-mn to Man ' 
as ' the death-song of spiritual decadence and 
the birth-song of spiritual renascence.' Of his 
lyrics of nature he writes with exquisite charm, 
and his doctrine is thus expressed : 

'Mere descriptive poetry of the prepense and 
formal kind is exceptionally if not proverbially 
liable to incur and to deserve the charge of dulness: 
it is unnecessary to emphasize or obtrude the per- 
sonal note, the presence or the emotion of a spec- 
tator, but it is necessary to make it felt and keep 
it perceptible if the poem is to have life in it or 
even a right to live.' 

To know how faithfully Mr. Swinburne has fol- 
lowed this precept we have but to recall a few 
such poems as ' A Forsaken Garden,' ' In the 
Ba}-,' and * By the Xorth Sea.' 

Mr. Swinburne's personal and memorial 
poems have often brought upon him the charge 
of extravagance in praising, and it is only nat- 
ural that he should take some account of this 
accusation, 

'If ever a word of tributary thanksgiving for 
the delight and the benefit of loyal admiration 
evoked in the spirit of a boy or aroused in the 
intelligence of a man may seem to exceed the limit 
of demonstrable accuracy, I have no apology to 
offer for any such aberration from the safe path of 
tepid praise or conventional applause.' 

Confessing to rare good fortune in both friends 
and enemies, he declares that it should be 

'Always a subject for thankfulness and self- 
congratulation if a man can honestly and reasonably 
feel assured that his friends and foes alike have 
been always and at almost all points the very men 
he would have chosen, had choice and foresight been 
allowed him, at the very outset of his career in 
life.' 

Most of all was he fortunate in winning the 
friendship of Landor, Mazzini, and Hugo, ' the 
three living gods, I do not say of my idolatry, 
for idolatry is a term inapplicable where the 
gods are real and true, but of my whole-souled 
and single-hearted worship.' What wonder that 
he should have sought to find expression in song 
for the joy of such friendships, and that he 



should have found terms for the expression in 
some degree commensurate with his gratitude^ 

The two great misapprehensions of the gen- 
eral public concerning Mr. Swinburne'si work 
are that it is prevailingly sensual and that its 
verbal affluence conceals poverty of thoughti 
Both these notions are supremely ridiculous/ 
The first of these notions is the exact opposite 
of the truth, and could not possibly be enter- 
tained by anyone familiar with the work as at 
whole. In all but a few of his pieces, he is a 
poet of spirit rather than of sense, and austerity 
is perhaps the most fitting epithet to apply to- 
liis work. Nor does it take a very prolonged 
study of that work to discover that it is rich- 
in thought and varied in intellectual interesli 
beyond the work of most other poets. Mr^ 
Swinburne would be the last person to deny 
that poetry must be the embodiment of ideas^ 
or fail absolutely in its mission. His own words 
are these: 

'There is no music in verse which has not in it 
sufficient fullness and ripeness of meaning, sufficient 
adequacy of emotion or of thought, to abide tha 
analysis of other than the published scrutiny of 
prepossession or the squint-eyed inspection ot. 
maUgnity. ' 

By this test he is clearly willing to be judged^ 
and we have no doubt that when judged by it 
fairly and fully, he will not be found wanting. 



THE AMERICAN LITE RARY INSTINCT. 

Geographical and racial explanations of the 
evolution of genius have become somewhat 
faded of late. Even Taine modified his theories 
considerably after the publication of his ' His- 
tory of English literature.' But one would 
like to call his spirit up and propound the 
following problem to him : * There is a country, 
sir, larger in extent than Europe. It is a land; 
of extremes. In summer it is throughout nearly 
its whole extent a part of the tropics. In winter 
the north pole is seemingly situated in every 
city. Its geographical features are on an enor-. 
mous scale, — tremendous mountain systems^^ 
vast rivers, limitless plains, unending forests.. 
It is inhabited by eighty millions of people 
drawn from all the great stocks of the world.^ 
It is a new ark where descendants of all of 
N'oah's family are reunited. And they are fused 
together by one system of laws and the use of 
one language. What, sir, in your judgment^ 
should be the resulting literary instincte and 
development of such a people?' 

Can we doubt that our critic's ashes would 
lighten with his wonted fires, that his ghost[ 
eyes would glitter with delight, and that he 
would say, though in far more vivid phrase,*^ 



114 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



fiomething like this : ' Excellent ! Superb ! You 
ere describing the place and the moment for 
an ideal outburst of literature. The muster of 
races in your new empire should bring together 
all the instincts and ideals of the world. The 
North should send you its cloudy gods, its 
dreamings and its doubts. The South should 
bestow upon you its clear divinities, its passions 
and its fire. Your literary population should be 
a cast of stars. Your geographical immensities 
should raise to the nth power all the forces and 
faculties of the migrating personages of older 
mythologies and literatures. A brighter Hamlet 
should jostle a darker Othello, The Greek 
Achilles, the Gennan Siegfried, the Celtic 
Cuchulain should reincarnate themselves in 
more splendid forms. Art should be the inherit- 
ance of your whole people. Your brilliant and 
intoxicating atmosphere should cause them to 
talk business in blank verse, do their love- 
making in song, go to church in a galliard, and 
ijome home in a coranto.^ 

So perhaps it should be — but so certainly 
it has not been. If one were exactly to reverse 
ifchis imaginary picture one would be nearer the 
anark. Once indeed in our history, back in the 
iforties and fifties, there was a stir of intellec- 
Ttual life in this country. Foreign philosophies 
-were imported and retailed, native folk-lores 
"ivere investigated, our men of intellect stood at 
ithe stiBet comers and crowds assembled to listen 
tto iflrem, there was a cry that we must have a 
national literature. And a very remarkable if 
not absolutely great artistic production resulted. 
Even then the careers of the greatest were fresh 
illustrations of the fact that when God creates 
^ genius, he signs a lettre de cachet, a sentence 
of life imprisonment in the world. Poe was 
practically starved out. Hawthorne would have 
.«hared his fate but for the accident of his 
ihaving a personal friend in Franklin Pierce. 
Lowell, Longfellow, and Bryant wasted their 
Ibest years in dry professorial or newspaper 
?iw>rk. Yet the difference between then and now 
is enormous. If these people were not rewarded 
■greaily, they were listened to and discussed. 
'They felt they had a public. It is safe to say 
that there was, not relatively but absolutely, 
twenty times as much sympathy for and appre- 
ciation of things of the mind in their time as 
there is today. 

A recently translated book, ' Success among 
IN^ations^' by a brilliant Hungarian, Emil Reich, 
•devotes a chapter to American possibilities, 
intellectual and political. The author has no 
■great admiration for us and no grave fear of 
•our dominating the world in either way. He 
dscribes the inferiority which he attributes to 
•08 to three causes: First, the overwhelming 
imfluence of our women; second, the lack of 



outward pressure which would drive us to an 
intenser inward life; third, our almost exclu- 
sive preoccupation with commerce and industry. 
Woman and Genius are enemies of old. Pos- 
sibly the root of their hostility is that they both 
bear children. Another reason is that society 
is the creation of woman and that the rough, 
sayage Orson-like Genius is a creature of soli- 
tude, and seldom comes into society except to 
revolt against it and try to shake it down. 
France is the only nation where woman has a 
power and influence comparable with that which 
she exercises in America. M. Brunetiere, in an 
admirable essay, has sought to determine the 
amount of success with which woman has 
wielded her sceptre in France. He is most 
polite; he makes out the best case he can for 
the ladies; but in the end he is forced to confess 
that not a single Frenchman of first-class talent 
has ever bowed to feminine domination. Third- 
rate thinkers, lap-dog poets, a long train of 
Abbes and Academicians has thronged their 
salons. But Rabelais, Montaigne, Moliere, Cor- 
neille, Lafontaine, and their like, have shoul- 
dered their way on without the aid of feminine 
plots or applause. It is not that these men did 
not feel the charm and beauty of womanhood. 
Genius generally feels it too deeply. But they 
declined to submit first-rate intellects to the 
domination of second-rate ones. It is precisely 
in those countries where woman is kept in the 
background, in England and Germany, that 
the ideal of womanhood blooms most gorgeously 
in the pages of the poets. Neither France nor 
America can show anything in their literatures 
to match the women of Shakespeare and Goethe. 
And America at least has but few of those 
lyrics of love and admiration which are as 
numerous in the literatures of other nations as 
the songs of their birds in spring. Think of the 
long roll of English love poems, — the epi- 
thalamiums of Spenser, the Elizabethan son- 
nets, the verse of Donne, the Cavalier lyrics, 
the triumphant strains of Bums and Shelley, 
and Tennyson's picture gallery of fair women ! 
With us, Poe's few mystical notes of adoration, 
two or three southern love-songs, and some 
rather cold poems by the New England men, 
are about all that our women have been able 
to inspire. Probably they do not care; having 
the reality of reign they may not need verbal 
homage. But their throne has been built up 
mainly by the poet. Every educated man sees 
in his mistress's face not only her own beauty, 
but the shadow of the beauty of the heroines 
of song. She sums up for him all that ideal 
seraglio which has filled his brain since boy- 
hood. She is Rosalind and Viola and Imogen, 
Shelley's Miranda, and Burns's Mary Morison. 
And to keep her power alive she needs to be

able to compel men to create new images of 
her grace and charm. Should women ever suc- 
ceed in having poetry dismissed from the ser- 
Tice of mankind, should they kick down the 
ladder by which they have risen, they will soon 
themselves be relegated back into the rank of 
squaws and serfs. 

Our Hungarian author holds that the 
strength of Europe is in its division, that the 
hard-won boundaries of the different lands have 
preserved national peculiarities, have fostered 
varietv' and stren^h of character, have fenced 
out influences which vrould have resulted in a 
Chinese uniformity. The view is sound. Here 
in America we have established a certain form 
of civilization and then set it in motion on its 
Juggernaut course to crush and roll out all 
originality and level the natural elevations and 
depressions of humanity into one desert of 
commonplace. Everybody must be alike through 
twenty degrees of latitude and fifty of longi- 
tude. Even if the type of civilization which 
we have evolved were the highest possible, such 
sameness would be soul-depressing. Everj'^ one, 
I suppose, has revolted against the Miltonic 
idea of heaven because of the monotony of 
amiabilit)' and harp-playing which prevailed 
there before Lucifer put some variet}' into the 
place. The slightest acquaintance with foreign 
•countries is enough to convince one that the 
cultivation of personality', of eccentricity even, 
adds greatly to the delight of human inter- 
course. And of course it is the salt and savor 
•of literature. Compare two contemporary nov- 
els, one English and the other American, and 
it will be seen at once that English life is 
infinitely richer in varied types of humanity 
than American. It would be interesting to 
speculate as to the results if the Southern Con- 
federacy had succeeded in breaking up our 
nation. A great slave-holding aristocracy left 
to develop at its own will would probably have 
given birth to magnificent personalities. One 
sign of the spirit of conformity which prevails 
in America is the liking for the study of law, 
which has obtained here from the beginning. 
Edmund Burke said in one of his speeches that 
"there had been more copies of Blackstone sold 
in the Colonies than in the mother country. 
Now law is a narrowing study. It is apt to 
make men as sharp and bright and as like as 
pins. I remember once, in a dispute with my old 
law preceptor, I drew on a piece of paper a 
perpendicular line and beside it a circle. The 
straight line, I said, represented the legal mind, 
the circle the poetical. *Yes,' answered my 
friend, 'the lawyer is an integer and the poet 
a cipher.' The rejoinder was clever, and it is 
odd that men have accepted the same sign as 
.a sjrmbol of nothingness and of the universal. 



Commercialism, I fear, is ingrained in Amer- 
ica, — it is blood of our blood, bone of our bone. 
Other nations, of course, have been and are 
commercial, and as long as we must eat and 
have clothes to cover us there is no help for it. 
But in other nations there is a saving sense of 
something better. The secret desire of an 
Englishman is to be a Lord. The secret desire 
of a Frenchman is to be a Member of the 
Academy. The secret desire of a German is to 
write a big book on the Dialects of the Turanian 
Tribes. These ambitions are a ferment that 
elevate and lighten life. I have cast about a 
good deal for a formula which would express 
the honest ambition of the average American, 
and the other day I found it in the first line 
of an insurance advertisement which met my 
eye. It ran thus : ' To live better and save 
more is the big idea which goes to bed with us 
all.' Obviously this sage of the shop does not 
mean by his ' live better ' the same thing which 
Marcus Aurelius meant when he said, ' Even 
in a palace life may be lived well.' No! He 
means by it to have more food and better 
clothes and a bigger house and greater social 
importance. There is no harm, indeed there 
is good in these things; but to make them the 
'big idea which goes to bed with us all,' — 
why, the Hottentots have a higher hope. No 
real religion, or art, or literature, no science 
save that which ministers to material wants, 
can flourish in a community obsessed by such 
ambition. 

Yet as all men crave permanence, and strive 
to leave some record of themselves, as the savage 
carves pieces of bone or scratches hunting scenes 
on the wall of his cave, so we are forced to 
some kind of art. And the kinds of art which 
are accepted and are successful among us 
express our popular instincts. As a corollary 
to the dominance of woman in our life we have 
a worship of prettiness and decorum. We do 
small things delicately. We are much concerned 
with style, and import the last year's fashions 
from France and England and make fetiches 
of them. As women approve authority, we are 
fond of maxim-makers and moralists and 
writers who tell us how to succeed in life. I 
have always thought that people must be very 
bad to need to go to church as much as they 
do; and similarly I think the nation must be 
weak mentally and morally which requires so 
many props of moral phrases and axioms to 
support it. On the otlier hand, our women- 
instructed minds shrink from strong passions 
and tragic situations. We must apologize for 
indulging in tragedy, as Snug the Joiner apol- 
ogized for bringing a Hon into the presence of 
the ladies. Wihitman was perfectly right in 
his characterization of our lady-like literature.

THE DIAX. 



[Feb. 16, 



If he had only had the ability to visualize his 
ideas, to create instead of merely making cata- 
logues of possible characters and giving hints 
of situations rank from the soil, he would have 
been a great literary reformer. That he would 
have been popular is another thing. Poe, our 
profoundest thinker and artist, is not popular, 
Hawthorne, a tragedian of the spirit, is not 
popular. Cooper is only read by boys ; Herman 
Melville and Brockden Browne are not read at 
all. Hardly anything, indeed, is read today 
except that which deals gracefully with the 
commonplace, touches on the domestic emo- 
tions, or gratifies our social vanity by reviving 
the names and deeds of our not very remote 
forefathers. 

The corollary to the uniformity of our life 
is a notable lack of depth and variety of person- 
alities in our books. It is hardly too much to 
say that there are more vivid, original, eccen- 
tric characters in a single novel of Smollett or 
Dickens than in our whole novel literature. 
Our striving is for good taste, — we are going 
to be genteel if we break something; and our 
books reflect the general insipidity and tame- 
ness. 

The corollary to our commercialism is a 
distaste for the ideal and a craving for cheap 
amusement. Life is not enacted in Wall or 
Wake street as it is in the plays of Shakespeare 
or the dramas of Wagner. Dealers in sugar 
and cotton and manipulators of the stock mar- 
ket are not going to believe in gods and ghosts 
and elves and heroes and heroines of romance. 
When they need relaxation they swap doubtful 
stories, or read the productions of our immortal 
American humorists ; or go to see the light and 
frothy performances of our stage. I have in 
mind a famous club where rich men congregate 
and where the haMtues sit around and listen 
to the news from the stock ticker, and when 
there is any great fluctuation in the market 
they get their pencils out and calculate how 
much each of their friends has gained or lost 
by the operation. That is an intellectual diver- 
sion of a kind, — but ah ! how different from 
the conversation in a street of Athens when 
Socrates had gathered a crowd about him, or 
the talk in the circles of the Mermaid Inn or 
Johnson's Club, or the intercourse in the court 
of Saxe- Weimar. 

In one of Keats' s letters he describes himself 
as standing in a central street of London and 
looking north, east, south, and west, and seeing 
nothing anywhere but dulness. We cannot 
always tell at a given time what ferment is 
going on about us, what rich and glorious 
fabrics of thought and art are rising like exhal- 
ations, silently and unseen. But certainly there 
is little in America today to encourage a lover 



of the things of the mind. Our poets are driven 
into business, our artists into exile. Our 
thinkers become college professors, where they 
dry up and blow away. Sir Richard Temple 
said once that ' None was ever a great poet 
who did much apply himself to anything else.' 
We cannot expect a great literature if we do 
not support and back the persons who can pro- 
duce. But Americans do not want a great 
literature. They want, in the inspired words 
of our insurance advertisement, ' to live better 
and save more.' Charles Leonard Mooee. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE AUTHOR OF 'MILTON'S PRAYER OF 

PATIENCE.' 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The reviewer of Mr. Marston's Reminiscences, 
in your issue of January 16, is correct in sup- 
posing the poem attributed to Milton on his blind- 
ness to have been written by Elizabeth Lloyd 
Howell. Mr. Marston is also correct, for Lloyd 
was Mrs. Howell's maiden name. She changed 
both her name and her religious denomination 
on her marriage; and although really best known 
through an allusion to her by Whittier,— the 
poem describing a summer ride with her,— she 
once spoke of him to me in a distinctly superior 
and patronizing manner. She was a woman of 
some beauty, but was charged by some of the 
ladies at the summer boarding house where we 
met with wearing 'plumpers' in her cheeks, Avhat- 
ever they may be,— a form of self-decoration in 
which the kindly Quaker poet would have found, 
I am sure, some hearty amusement. Mr. Sted- 
man, in the excellent biographical notes at the 
end of his 'American Anthology,' speaks of her 
poems as having appeared in 'The Wheat Sheaf 
in 1852. She lived to be eighty-five, but did not 
further distinguish herself, I believe, t. W. H.

A SHAKESPEARE QUARTO FOUND. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

My friend. Dr. F. J. Fumivall, has just sent 
me the 'Westminster Gazette' for January 13, 
which states that a copy of the 1594 quarto of 
'Titus Andronieus' has been found in the house 
of a countrywoman in Sweden. Such an edition 
was entered on the Stationers' Registers under 
date of February 6, 1594, as 'a book intituled a 
Noble Romaine Historye of Titus Andronieus'; 
but no copy of it has previously been discovered. 
Langbaine, in his 'Dramatic Poetry' (1691), re- 
fers to it, but even at that early date no copy had 
survived. 

The book is at present in the care of the libra- 
rian of Lund University. An offer of £300 has 
been made for it and refused. It will probably 
fetch more than double that price when put on the 
market. W. J. Rolfe.

A WORDSWORTHIAX IK REMDTISCENT 

Mood. * 

Any book from the pen of Dr. William 
Knight, the Wordsworth scholar and St. 
Andrews professor of philosophy, is sure to be 
richly worth the reading. His ' Eetrospects/ 
of which the first yolume now appears, is a treat 
such as his long acquaintance with men of let- 
ters, his yeai-s of work side by side with them 
in the field of literature, and his mastery of 
the art of pen portraiture, would have led one 
confidently to expect. After noting, in his 
preface, the indisputable benefit to be derived 
from communion, whether personal or through 
books, with ' characters that are strong,' orig- 
inal, exalted and benign, that are many-sided, 
fertile-minded and ideal,' he says a word con- 
demnatory of that distorted presentation of a 
man's life which is not seldom found in the 
so-called critical biography. ' What is posterity 
the better,' he asks, ' for knowing the verdict of 

A, B, and C upon "the great of old," whose 
spirits still " rule us from their urns " ; more 
especially when there is much more of the A, 

B, and C, the new critics, than of the departed 
sage or seer in the books which the former 
write? What it surely needs much more is to 
have an adequate and trustworthy re-presenta- 
tion of the past, and new pictures of the men 
and women — these " great of old " — as in a 
mirror, so that the living may be able to realize 
the dead as they lived and moved and had 
their being in the flesh.' Without conscious 
idealization, therefore, or any embroidery or 
amplification of plain facts and spoken words, 
Professor Knight has produced some chapters 
of fragmentarv^ biography that are as fascinat- 
ing as they are convincing, their very charm 
indeed largely lying in their evident truthful- 
ness and their admirable restraint. *I lack 
the power,' he says, ' of recasting or recon- 
structing a conversation out of a minimum of 
actual fact. In no instance is an attempt made 
to reproduce a lengthened conversation with 
those whose letters are printed. ^Many detached 
remarks are given, but no continuous discus- 
sion.' Without further preliminaries, let us 
now plunge in medias res. Here is a glimpse 
of Carlyle and his wife : 

'We were sitting in the "golden silence" he 
loved so much, and yet ignored so often, when Mrs. 
Carlyle entered. I was struck by her gracious air. 
That afternoon it was most gracious. She was pre- 
paring tea, when her husband made a disparaging 
remark on one of our modern writers; and she said, 
■with the utmost naivete, "Oh, Tom, you're so

eccentric." "Yes," exclaimed — ^I may say growled 
— her husband; "Yes, hut can you find my cen- 
tref" ' 

A visit to Tennyson in 1890 is described. 
The grace and dignity with which the aged poet 
bore his weight of years was impressive. 
' There was the keen eagle eye ; and though the 
glow of youth was gone, the strength of a^e was 
in its place. The lines of his face were like the 
furrows in the stem of a wrinkled oak-tree ; but 
his whole bearing disclosed a latent strength 
and nobility, a reserve of power, combined with 
a most courteous grace of manner. I was also 
struck by the neglige air of the man ; so differ- 
ent from that of Browning, or Arnold, or 
Lowell.' From the conversation recorded, all 
noteworthy, a paragraph on the sonnet may be 
quoted. 

*He said he thought the best in the language were 
Milton's, Shakespeare's, and Wordsworth's; after 
these three, those by his own brother Charles. "I 
at least rank my brother's next to those by the 
three Olympians." He added, "A sonnet arrests 
the free sweep of genius, and if poets were to keep 
to it, it would cripple them; but it is a fascinating 
kind of verse, and to excel in it is a rare distinc- 
tion." I ventured to refer to the metrical and 
structural necessity that its last line should form 
the climax, both of thought and expression, in a 
sonnet; and that the whole should be like a wave 
breaking on the shore. He said, "Not only so; 
the whole should show a continuous advance of 
thought and of movement, like a river fed by 
rillets; as every great poem, and all essays and 
treatises, should." ' 

The memoir of Tennyson by his son has made 
us familiar with the poet's firm belief in the 
immortality of the soul, a belief that also finds 
frequent attestation in his poems. Worth 
recording in this connection is his assertion to 
Professor Knight that *the idea of annihila- 
tion would be more horrible to me than the idea 
of everlasting torments.' 

The charm of Dean Stanle}''s radiant, ver- 
satile, many-sided personality is well conveyed. 
Let us quote an incident illustrating his imper- 
turbable good humor. 

'On another occasion he was journeying in the 
same neighborhood, when two fellow-passengers in 
his carriage, ignorant of who he was, began to abuse 
the heretical and latitudinarian Dean, unstinting 
in their denunciations. When he reached his sta- 
tion, and was about to walk to a carriage in wait- 
ing, he suddenly remembered that he had left his 
umbrella in the train and returned for it, when 
the passenger who had used so many bad words 
about him had taken it up, and found the name 
(the Dean of Westminster) on the handle. He 
apologized profoundly, and said that he did not 
know who it was who was travelling with him. 
"Never mind," said the Dean. "You have given 
me a good deal to think about, and I am much 
obliged to you." ' 

This chapter, one of the longest and best in the 
book, closes with a lecture by Stanley on * The 
Mutual Eelations of Religion, Science, and

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Literature,' which he delivered at Dundee in 
1875, and which has never before been pub- 
lished except as a newspaper report. 

Of Gladstone's phenomenal memory, and of 
his wide reading in general literature, we have 
heard much. Following is. an anecdote illus- 
trating both: 

'I well remember a dinner-party in London at 
which Mr. Gladstone was the principal guest, 
although there were many representatives of Latera- 
ture and Science as well as Politics present. After 
dinner the conversation turned to the number of 
lines in the great poems of the world; and Mr. 
Gladstone was asked: How many are there in the 
"Iliad"? He at once replied, and to a second 
question gave the number in the "Odyssey." "In 
the 'Divine Comedy'?" inquired one guest. 
Instantly the number in the "Inferno," the "Pur- 
gatorio," and the "Paradiso" were told. In 
"Hamlet," "Paradise Lost," "Faust" (I only 
remember these), the answer came without a pause, 
as if out of a brain in compartments, where the 
facts had been stored away, and which now opened 
as by a spring. I was asked by our host if I could 
tell the number in "The Excursion" and in "The 
Prelude," and by some one else how many there 
were in "The White Doe of Bylstone." In each 
case I had to shake my head in ignorance. I said 
it had never occurred to me to estimate poems by 
their quantity. "No," said Gladstone, "none of 
us do that — the test is a qualitative one — ^but liter- 
ary statistics are bf use." It seemed to me, how- 
ever, as if the instinct of the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer had been at work in the brain of the 
Premier in reference to the great poems of the 
world, and that the chambers of memory were full 
to overflowing. On telling this afterwards at St. 
Andrews to his old Oxford tutor — Bishop Charles 
Wordsworth — he said that Gladstone's memory was 
superlative. "I remember sending him, to the 
country house in which he was then residing, a 
Latin version which I had just written of one of 
the hymns in the 'Christian Year.' He replied at 
once, and quoted in his letter another excellent 
rendering of the same hymn in Latin, made long 
ago by a friend of his, which he said was still as 
vivid to him as if he had received it yesterday." ' 

Among lesser notables, the author gives excel- 
lent pictures of those ardent apostles of the 
true and the beautiful, James Smetham, 
William Davies, and J. Henry Shorthouse, and 
a vei-y readable chapter on that woman of rare 
scholarship, Anna Swanwick. Smetham, the 
artist and poet, w^as one of those whose patient 
strivings are not destined to be crowned with 
conventional success - — which, however, was the 
last thing desired in his case. ' In my secret 
heart,' he declares, ' I look upon myself as one 
who has got on, and got to his goal, as one who 
has got something a thousand times better than 
a fortune, more real, more inward, less in the 
poAver of others, less variable, more immortal, 
more eternal; as one whose feet are on a rock, 
his goings established, with a new song in his 
mouth, and joy on his head.' In his memories 
of Whitwell Elwin, rector of Booton in Nor- 
folk, and editor of the ' Quarterly Review ' 
from 1854 to 1867, Professor Knight quotes 



from one of Elwin's letters a curious anecdote 
showing how painstaking Wordsworth was in 
applying the file to his verses. Mrs. Gaskell is 
the ultimate authority for the story, and is 
quoted by Elwin as follows: 

'One day when they were living at Grasmere (no 
post-office there) Wordsworth walked over to Amble- 
side (more than four miles) to post some poem that 
was to be included in a volume just being printed. 
After dinner, as he sat meditating, he became dis- 
satisfied with one line, and grew so restless over the- 
thought that towards bedtime he declared he must 
go to Ambleside and alter it; for "in those days: 
postage was very heavy, and we were obliged to be 
very prudent." So he and Miss Wordsworth set 
off after nine o 'clock, walked to Ambleside, knocked 
up the post-office people, asked for a candle, got 
the letter out of the box, sent the good people to 
bed again, and sat in the little parlour, "puzzling 
and puzzling till they got the line right"; when 
they replaced the letter, put out the candle, and 
softly stole forth, and walked home in the winter 
midnight. ' 

Having now had a glimpse of this, that, and 
the other of our authors contemporaries, let 
us take a look at the writer himself. In a letter 
that he prints from James Martineau is a pro- 
posal that Mr. Knight should succeed Dr. 
Martineau as minister of little Portland Street 
Chapel, a position Martineau was forced to 
resign in 1872. Although the offer was 
declined, the letter attests the broad liberality 
of both writer and recipient. 

'As I muse upon the matter, I come round again 
and again to the one only thing which, as I believe, 
would hold and save these people, and prevent the' 
virtual sacrifice of their spiritual life: viz. your 
removal to London to take charge of them. It is; 
a daring, and I fear an impracticable, thought. I 
see all the difficulty of such a move after so recent 
a declaration of Trinitarian opinion — though not as; 
identified with Christianity, but only as an after- 
thought of philosophical speculation. I hear before- 
hand the outcry of your opponents, that their sus- 
picions are justified. I anticipate scruples on the- 
part of my own people. Nevertheless, beneath all 
this, the natural affinities and realities are on the 
side of such a solution. And if my people had the 
magnanimity to rely on the-se and offer you a free 
pulpit, trusting that adequate theological sympathy 
would work itself out; and if you, on the strength 
of this unpledged attitude, felt encouragement to- 
brave reproach, and take a position involving no 
retraction and only the engagement to go whither 
the truth of God might lead; it is my sincere per- 
suasion that a work would open before you here- 
more congenial and of higher character than any 
which the Free Kirk can have in reserve for you. 
You are appointed, I must think, to draw upwards 
those who would otherwise have less faith than you: 
and your faculties will never move with their 
power unhindered till you have to deal with such an 
audience.' 

Other most interesting chapters, of which lack 
of space forbids further notice, are on Brown- 
ing, Frederick Denison Maurice, and Matthew 
Arnold. A second volume is promised, giving

dinal Newman, George Frederick Watts, James

The Iroquois Confederacy.* 

This will surely be remembered as an era of 
historical reprints, so far at least as the United 
States is concerned. Xever before, probably, 
has there been such a veritable flood of old his- 
torical books reissued in new dress. What is 
more to the point, the books themselves are in 
nearly every case books of real value, — books 
which have not been, and often could not be, 
replaced by later works in the same field. 

It is also a notable fact that, either directly 
or indirectly, a large proportion of these books 
throw light upon the history and the manners 
and customs of the Indian tribes; and several 
are devoted especially to that most remarkable 
of Xorth American tribes, the Iroquois. Xot 
long ago, Cadwallader Colden's ' History of the 
Five Indian Xations of Canada' appeared in 
a neat little reprint, in two volumes; but 
without that indispensable adjunct of a history 
of any sort — an index. Xow we have two 
other books dealing with the same tribe: Mor- 
gan's 'League of the Iroquois,' and Canfield's 
'Legends of the Iroquois.' Though published 
more than half a centurj- ago, Morgan's ' League 
of the Iroquois ' still remains the best and most 
authoritative work on the subject. It is not 
absolutely free from historical and other 
errors, — indeed, what work is ? — but they are 
all of comparatively minor importance, and the 
book is, as Francis Parkman described it, a 
'production of singular merit.' The present 
edition — for it would be most unjust to call 
it merely a reprint — presents not only a scru- 
pulously accurate printing of the edition of 
1851, but is enriched with voluminous notes by 
the present editor, Mr. Herbert M. Lloyd; an 
Introduction, by the editor; some interesting 
personal reminiscences of Morgan, by Mr.

but by no means least, an excellent index, 
including a partial vocabulary of Seneca names. 
The illustrations include a portrait of Morgan, 
and a map of the Iroquois country prepared by 
the Rev. Wm. M. Beauchamp, S.T.D. A fact 
worthy of special commendation is that the 
editor has availed himself to a very large extent 
of Morgan's own emendations of his original 
text, whether contained in his subsequent 
works or in the form of manuscript notes. In 
this way we have in many cases Morgan's cor- 
rections of his own mistakes — mistakes which 
he was led into in the 1851 book, through 
insufficient information, but which his own sub- 
sequent investigations proved to be false or 
inaccurate. 

For his editorial notes Mr. Lloyd has drawn 
upon every source of information, and they 
reveal his wide and discriminating reading of 
literature on the Iroquois. There is just onfe 
criticism that must be made, and that applies 
not to the substance but to the arrangement 
of the notes. These are thrown into a bulky 
Appendix at the back of the book, and are 
arranged in such a fashion that reference to 
them is anything but convenient. Possibly -a 
good deal of this is due to the fact that in the 
present edition the two former volumes are 
thrown into one, while the paging remain^ 
distinct. Had the book been paged in a single 
series through the two volumes, much of the 
confusion might have been avoided. However, 
this is a minor point. 

One cannot easily overestimate the import 
tance and value of Morgan's 'League of tb^ 
Iroquois.' If only as a reliable record of th^ 
political and social organization of an extremely 
interesting tribe, it would be a work of per- 
manent interest. The Iroquois had no written 
language ; their laws and history and traditions 
were carried down from mouth to moutlu 
Though greatly reduced in numbers, they stili 
retain their individuality as a tribe, or group 
of tribes ; but it is probable that even now much 
of the material contained in Mr. Morgan's book 
would have been unobtainable, had the ' League 
of the Iroquois ' never been written, — and 
within a comparatively short time, when the last 
remnant of the once all-powerful Confederacy 
disappears in the surrounding mass of Aryafi 
stock, the history of the great League would! 
have become a lost chapter in the history of 
America. Morgan's entiiusiasm for his worlj^

bine to make the ' League of the Iroquois ' not 
only a work of prime importance to all students 
of Indian life and character, but a book that 
one reads with genuine enjoyment for its own 
sake. 

. Perhaps an even deeper interest attaches to 
this work on the Iroquois, — so far, at least, 
as the author himself is concerned, — by reason 
of a vast investigation which grew directly out 
of it, and to which Morgan devoted the latter 
half of his life. In studying the manners and 
customs of the Senecas, he had been struck by 
the peculiar system of relationship which 
existed in that tribe, — a system under which 
the familiar relationships of father, mother, 
sister, brother, uncle, aunt, etc., were extended 
apparently beyond the usual limits of consan- 
guinity, in a most bewildering fashion. To 
othersj as the Rev. Dr. Mcllvaine has pointed 
out, this apparent confusion of relationships, 
though often noticed before, had suggested 
nothing but the confusion of a savage mind 
and the reign of unreason. To Morgan it was 
the first step upon a great linguistic trail, which 
he was to follow throughout the remainder of 
his life, and which led him to results far 
transcending his expectations. It led him, 
^rst of all, to the discovery that the Iroquois 
method of characterizing kinship was substan- 
tially the same as that of the Dakotah tribes 
in the Far West. This induced him to conjec- 
ture whether, if such an extraordinary system 
were common to two tribes so remote as the 
Iroquois and the Dakotah, it might not be 
•found to be common to all the tribes of North 
and South America. 

• Here one may note the two characteristics 
which, above all others, marked the nature of 
Lewis Morgan, and were chiefly responsible for 
his successful conclusion of a task that can only 
b6 described as gigantic; these were his ver}' 
remarkable power of generalization — a power 
which seemed to have in it something very like 
intuition, — and his indomitable perseverance. 
He followed this intellectual trail with all the 
obstinate persistency of one of those Iroquois 
wa:rriors for whom he possessed such genuine 
sympathy. As the first of these characteristics 
Jed him to generalize as to the probable exist- 
ence of a system of consanguinity common to all 
the American tribes, with all the important 
conclusions to which such a fact would inevi- 
tably lead, so the second induced him to devote 
ten long years to an investigation of the sub- 
ject, which not only embraced all the available 
literature, but included personal visits to every 
important tribe on the continent. The result 
)Fas a complete vindication of his theory. 

But the trail did not end here; it led him 
still farther afield. If the system of relation- 



ship first discovered among the Iroquois was 
now proved to be common to all the aboriginal 
tribes of North and South America, was it not 
possible that the same system might be found 
among the Turanian and Polynesian families? 
Another ten years were given to this investi- 
gation, schedules of questions being prepared 
and sent through the Smithsonian Institution 
to missionaries and American consuls in every 
quarter of the globe. Again Morgan's broad 
and pregnant generalization proved to be cor- 
rect. 

Dr. Mcllvaine, whose reminiscences form an 
interesting feature of the appendix to the 
^League of the Iroquois,' tells us that during 
this period Morgan lived and worked under 
great mental excitement. 

'I well remember one occasion when he came into 
my study saying, "I shall find it, I shall find it 
among the Tamil people and Dravidian tribes of 
Southern India." At this time I had no expecta- 
tion of any such result; and I said to him, "My 
friend, you have enough to do in working out your 
discovery in connection with the tribes of the Amer- 
ican continent; let the peoples of the old world go." 
He replied "I cannot do it, — I cannot do it; I must 
go on, for I am sure I shall find it all there." Some 
months afterward he came in again, his face all 
aglow with excitement, the Tamil schedule in his 
hands, the answers to his questions just what he had 
predicted; and, throwing it on my table, he 
exclaimed, "There! What did I tell you?" ' 

But again the trail led him onward. If the 
same common system of relationship and affin- 
ity was common to all the members of the 
ancient Turanian and Polynesian stocks, as well 
as to the aboriginal tribes of America, it might 
also prove to have prevailed in early days among 
the two other great groups of the human family, 
the Semitic and Aryan races; in a word, it 
might, and probably would, prove to have been 
absolutely universal, and would lead back from 
each of the linguistic groups to the prehistoric 
race which was the progenitor of them all. Here 
was a problem to stir the blood, — one whose 
solution might satisfy any ambition. To quote 
again from Dr. Mcllvaine: 

'When he broached this final generalization to me 
I was appalled, not having the least expectation 
that it could be verified. But with his customary 
enthusiasm and energy, almost superhuman, he 
immediately addressed himself to another series of 
vast investigations, with a similar result in the 
end. He found overwhelming evidence that the 
system had once prevailed in all the Arabic or 
Semitic peoples, including the Hebrews, in all the 
Sanscritic or Aryan branches, the Brahmans, Per- 
sians, Greeks, Romans, Gothic, Celtic and Sclavonic 
nations, among our own ancestors, — in a word, 
throughout the human race, over three-fourths of 
which his investigations extended. This last gener- 
alization stands perhaps unequalled for its vastnesj 
and grandeur, and for its fruitfulness in results, by 
anything in the history of science known to me 
except that of the Newtonian theory of gravita- 
tion.'

The results of these long-continued investi- 
gations were published by the Smithsonian 
Institution, in 1871, in a large volume entitled 

* Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the 
Human Family.' The re\aewer well remembers 
the amazement with which he first looked 
through this great work and realized the stu- 
pendous nature of the task which had been 
brought to such a successful conclusion. The 
conclusions which grew inevitably out of a care- 
ful examination and analysis of these data went 
far beyond Mr. Morgan's most sanguine expec- 
tations. It not only became clear that the appar- 
ently meaningless system of relationship which 
he had proved to be common to every branch of 
the human family established beyond question 
the existence in prehistoric times of a universal 
system of communal marriage, but as the 
voluminous material was more exhaustively ana- 
lysed and compared, facts of startling signifi- 
cance emerged, — the curtain of countless gen- 
erations rolled back, and the prehistoric world, 
with its primitive social organization, and its 
primitive mental and moral structure, stood 
revealed. As Morgan had gathered together in 
his * Systems of Consanguinity ' an immense 
body of new facts, new data, so in his later work 
ion * Ancient Society ' he interpreted these facts 
and drew from them conclusions and generali- 
zations of the utmost importance to Ethnology 
and all its sister sciences. As the editor of the 
present book rightly says, ' ^lorgan's work in 
the domain of Ethnology is quite comparable 
to that of Darwin in another field.' 

So much space has been given to Mr. Morgan 
that it will be impossible to deal at length with 
the other author under consideration. Can- 
field's * Legends of the Iroquois ' is one of the 
most important volumes in the admirable series 
which the Wessels Company has been issuing 
for some time past, under the general editor- 
ship of !Mr. Kufus Rockwell Wilson. These 
volumes do not profess to be much more than 
reprints, with such notes as are absolutely indis- 
pensable; but in type, paper, and general 
makeup, they are all that could be desired. The 

* Legends of the Iroquois ' present what is from 
several points of view the most fascinating side 
of Indian character, the poetic and imaginative 
side. If space permitted it would be worth while 
to quote one of these legends, — for instance, 
the Birth of the Arbutus, as delicate and charm- 
ing a little allegory as one could find anywhere, 
but of which no just impression could be given 
without quoting it entire. It may be said for 
this book that while, like Morgan's ' League of 
the Iroquois,' it has a distinct value to the stu- 
dent of Ethnology, or anyone who is interested 
in the study of Indian life and character, it will 
also appeal with equal force to the reader who 



seeks only entertainment; for we venture to say 
that anyone who dips into this book of 
legends-^ one might almost call them fairy 
tales — will find them as fascinating as a book 
of verses or a metrical romance.

Mex axd Maxxers IX Tudor IjOxdox. * 

The time of the Tudors, beginning with the 
accession of Henry VII. in 1485 and ending with 
the death of Elizabeth in 1603, was one of the 
greatest periods in English history. It included 
the reigns of Henry YIL, Henry YIIL, Edward 
YI., Mary and Elizabeth. It embraced the 
entire sixteenth century, which saw the rise of 
absolute monarchy, the Reformation extended 
and England made Protestant, the Renaissance 
active in that country, the printing-press busy, 
a noble literature developed, the birth of mod- 
em science, and men's minds lifted to a new 
view-point of the universe and far above that 
from which they had previously observed nature 
and natural things; it saw also the greatest of 
commercial revolutions consequent upon the 
discover)' of a new ocean route to India, and a 
new world in the west opened for exploration 
and colonization- It was an age of great men ; 
more than two thousand English names from 
that century have been found worthy of a place 
in the 'Dictionary of National Biography,' — 
three times as many as appear from any previ- 
ous century. 

The gravitating point in this great historical 
period lay principally in London. By far the 
greatest number of events which made the time 
of the Tudors so important and so interesting 
occurred in that city, which, as the trade of the 
East deserted the Mediterranean lines and the 
older commercial capitals lost their rank, rose 
in greatness. It was there that the lives of the 
two Henrys, of Edward, of Mary and Elizabeth, 
were chiefly spent. It was there that the revo- 
lutions which marked the period found their 
storm-centre. It was in the city of London that 
executions occurred for witchcraft, for political 
causes, or for conscience's sake, the most numer- 
ous and notable in aU history. 

As London was England to so large an extent, 
we are naturally curious to learn all we can 
about the city at that interesting period. The 
late Sir Walter Besanf s quarto volume on ' Lon- 
don in the Time of the Tudors ' goes far toward 
gratifying our curiosity. It is in the same 
sumptuous form as the same author's * London 
in the Eighteenth Century,' reviewed in these 
columns some time since. The illustrations are

for the most part reproductions of contemporary 
prints; chief among them is a panorama of the 
city, extending over three double-pages of the 
book, originally drawn by Anthony Van den 
Wyngaerde in 1543, well illustrating the map 
folded into the cover, embracing 12 pages, and 
being a reduced reproduction of Ralph Agas's 
map of about 1560. The city thus presented to 
us was not a place of narrow crooked streets 
and closely-built houses, but a straggling town 
where parks and gardens and trees abounded, 
in the midst of which were to be seen such 
massive structures as the Tower of London, 
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, and many pal- 
aces, hospitals, and monastic buildings. 

London had not in those days assumed the 
gigantic uniformity of the modem metropolis, 
nor was it as yet wholly absorbed in the whirl 
of business life. It was not, as at present, a 
province covered with houses, but a city of 
moderate size, with walls and gates beyond 
which lay pleasant suburbs. It is difficult now 
to arrive at any correct estimate of its popula- 
tion. There could not have been less than thirty 
or forty thousand souls within its walls in the 
twelfth century; and in the succeeding cen- 
turies, while other towns in England were stead- 
ily declining, London was growing. It was 
estimated that in the reign of Mary the city 
had a population of from 150,000 to 180,000, 
and that this rose to 300,000 in 1607. All this 
was in spite of frequent visitations of the 
plague, causing a heavy death-rate, — as, for 
example, in 1564, when 23,660 died, more than 
20,000 of them of the plague. The number of 
foreign residents was probably not less than 
10,000 at the end of the sixteenth century. 

The business of the city, as well as its domes- 
tic operations, were largely carried on in the 
streets, much in the manner of a tropical city. 
Its red brick, half-timbered houses, with high 
gables, oriel windows, and terraces, and its citi- 
zens in picturesque and even gay attire, — ^all 
gave to the city the color and stamp of origin- 
ality. The Thames was crossed by but one 
bridge; its waters were clear, and gardens and 
meadows lined its banks, — though it is said to 
have given employment in 1594 to 40,000 men 
as boatmen, sailors, fishermen. It was a pleas- 
ure-loving city in those days. The barbers' and 
tobacconists' shops were favorite places of resort. 
Of the latter there were no less than seven thou- 
sand in the city; and in some of them instruc- 
tion was given in the art of smoking. St. 
Paul's was a rendezvous for promenaders and 
idle folk. Smithiield had its Fair on certain 
days. At Bartholomew's Fair were puppet- 
shows and exhibitions of curiosities, and in 
Southwark were bear-baitings. There were 
bowling alleys, cock-fighting, and ' tent-pegging 
in the tilt-yard.' Toward the end of the period 



arose the theatre, to surpass in popularity all 
other forms of amusement, notwithstanding the 
fierce invectives hurled against it by the Puri- 
tans. The city was full of inns; and wherea& 
these had formerly been places of lodging, and 
some of them, like the Inns of Court, were col- 
leges of residence, and totally distinct from the^ 
taverns and cookships whose business it was to 
furnish food and drink, it now became the 
function of the Inns to- provide food, and they 
were consequently made the meeting-places of 
those famous constituents of the early clubs. 

Sir Walter Besant's work is rightly called a 
survey. It is not a history; it is not a story. 
It is especially happy in its accounts of how 
people lived and dressed, what they ate and 
drank, what customs they pursued at their wed- 
dings and at the burial of their dead, — from the 
king and queen down to the 'prentice, who at 
this period was at the height of his power and 
importance, chiefly as a disturber of the peace, 
and whose business it was to attract customers 
by calling out in front of the shops, * What d'ye 
lack, gentles? What d'ye lack? My ware is 
best ! ' The author has drawn largely upon 
contemporary authors, — Stowe, Harrison (who 
contributed to Holinshed), the Maitland manu- 
scripts, and other works which can only be 
read at the present day through the medium of 
their modem transcribers.

The Monroe Doctrine to Date.* 



Magazine writers in America have for sev- 
eral decades past found agreeable occupation 
for their pens in discussing and explaining 
President Monroe's declaration concerning the 
attitude of America toward the interests of 
European nations on this continent. With each 
fresh possibility of a foreign entanglement has- 
appeared a new exposition of the proper Ameri- 
can policy ; and more or less difference of opin- 
ion has been developed, owing to the failure of 
commentators to examine the subject exhaus- 
tively. The events of recent years have not 
only renewed but intensified the public interest 
in the subject, and have furnished so much new 
material for consideration that what has here- 
tofore required space for a magazine article 
now demands a treatise. The appearance of 
Mr. Thomas B. Edgington's compendious vol- 
ume on the Monroe Doctrine is therefore timely^ 
The author, an attorney of over forty years' 
practice at the bar of Memphis, Tennessee, has 
brought to his task a long professional experi- 
ence, and an extended study of original sources

Bar of Memphis, Tennessee. Boston : Little, Brown & Co.

of information. The modest thesis of Mr. 
George F. Tucker of Boston (1885) has been 
drawTi upon, and followed in part ; but the pres- 
ent author has availed himself of the wealth of 
new material which recent international epi- 
sodes have introduced, and has brought down to 
date his discussion of the phases of Monroeism 
which have been made prominent in the debates 
of later years. Among other subjects thus pre- 
sented are the treaty establishing the Ha^e 
Tribunal, the Venezuelan Boundary case, the 
settlement of the European claims against 
Venezuela, and the Panama Canal treaty and 
concession. Mr. Edgington preserves a calm 
and historical spirit in all his comments on the 
interesting subjects of which he treats, and the 
argumentation in which he not infrequently 
indulges is that of a candid jurisconsult rather 
than that of a partisan. Indeed, it would be 
diflScult for a stranger to discover from these 
pages the author's political predilections. As 
authority for the positions he assumes, he makes 
numerous citations from well-established legal 
treatises, and from documents of historical ver- 
ity. The whole work may be called a glossary 
upon the leading features of recent American 
diplomacy, with the Monroe Doctrine kept in 
view as the cardinal feature. 

Mr. Edgington's exposition of the true scope 
and purport of President Monroe's declaration 
is correct and discriminating, and states clearly 
the present general understanding at home, and 
the same with which we are credited by most of 
the European states. AMiile the authoi^s general 
purpose is historical and not prophetic, he does 
not hesitate to point out in several respects 
what course the United States should pursue in 
order to preserve a just consistency with our 
past. The ' Calvo doctrine ' is expounded at 
length, exposing its errors, and its trangressions 
of international law; and the author explains 
that it cannot be combined with the Monroe 
Doctrine ' in any American system,' and urges 
that "the fact should be made known by the 
United States to the European powers that it 
does not indorse the Calvo heresy.' At the 
same time, 'the policy of this government 
should be to induce the Spanish-American 
republics to adopt the Monroe Doctrine each for 
itself.' And as the modem substitution of 
steam for sailing vessels has made coaling sta- 
tions necessary, we may well concede the use of 
such stations in this hemisphere to the European 
powers, as not inconsistent with the Monroe 
Doctrine, while we, without violating our own 
precedents, secure the use of similar stations 
abroad ; and ' it would be a sound international 
policy for the United States to take the initia- 
tive in this matter.' These, though the sugges- 
tions of an advocate rather than the comments 
of a historian, are timeh', and may well receive 



careful consideration. 

On the vexed question of Canning's claim to 
the authorship of the Monroe Doctrine, Mr. 
Edgington seems to be unusually undecided. 
What is apparently his conclusion on the sub- 
ject correctly avers that ' The term " Monroe 
Doctrine" simply became a new name for an 
old policy of the government. It was a policy 
recognized by Congress and sustained by the 
Federal and Anti-federal parties, as it is now 
by the Eepublican and Democratic parties.' 
This conclusion makes superfluous the authors 
previous statement that ' Canning thereupon, 
operating through Richard Kush and John 
Quincy Adams, became the real author of the 
Monroe declaration.' Xor should we, in justice 
to our own statesmen, concede, as does the 
author, that Hhe Monroe message, if not 
inspired by Mr. Canning in whole or in part, 
was at least in conformity with his general pol- 
icy.' The facts are, that the policy to which 
Canning vainly endeavored to commit the Mon- 
roe administration differed materially from the 
* Monroe Doctrine ' ; that the essential elements 
of that ' Doctrine ' were definitely adopted by the 
Monroe administration, and recognized as a part 
of * the old policy ' of this country, as early as 
1820, when we were first confronted with the 
schemes of the Holy Alliance ; that Monroe and 
Adams and Rush fathomed at once the British 
selfishness which inspired the ' Canning doc- 
trine,' turned coldly away from it, as their 
correspondence shows, and persisted in the 
course previously adopted; and that while 
Canning undoubtedly welcomed the. results 
which followed the Monroe declaration, no part 
of the credit therefor belongs to him. The 
American * aloofness' was pronounced, and 
Canning's failure to draw us into an 'entan- 
gling alliance' was conspicuous. The results 
of the action of the Monroe administration in 
1823 must be ranked among the accomplish- 
ments of American diplomacy.

Six Great Elizabethan Exglishmex.* 



The 'Dictionary of National Biography' is 
not an especially entertaining work. Its ' lives ' 
are compressed, confined to facts, and for the 
most part without criticism. When, therefore, 
^Ir. Sidney Lee, of recent years the editor of 
that work, prepared and later published his 
Lowell Institute lectures on ' Great Englishmen 
of the Sixteenth Century,' he was able to deck 
out a few bare biographies in a fashion more 
pleasing to the average reader than is per-

mitted in a biographical dictionary. He has 
vivified the personalities of these half-dozen 
men, — More, Sidney, Raleigh, Spenser, Bacon, 
and Shakespeare, — and has made them show- 
forth almost the entire activity of the age. The 
introductory chapter designs to give in brief 
prospect the spirit of the century as a whole, so 
as to make a sort of frame- work into which the 
succeeding chapters may be fitted, — in this 
respect being an improvement on the opening 
lecture, which surveyed in general terms the 
nses to the public of the ' Dictionary of National 
Biography.' 

Much that Mr. Lee says is of course trite 
enough. One cannot write of this century 
without frequent repetition of twice-told tales, 
such as the Archbishop of Canterbury's prophecy 
of More's greatness, or Shakespeare's munifi- 
•cence toward his wife in leaving her his second- 
best bedstead. Yet the book is no mere rehash- 
ing of the commonplace. Mr. Lee endeavors 
to place these men before us in the light of 
their personal environment as well as in the 
greater light of their relation to their time. 
Thus he points out the moral paradox in the 
minds and consciences of the men of this 
period, — More's liberalism in his 'Utopia,' 
and his intolerance in his own religious faith, 
intolerance which led him to the block; 
Ealeigh's elevated altruism in his ' Historic of 
the World,' and his dishonesty and greed of 
^old in his public life ; and, most noted of all. 
Bacon's lofty philosophic spirit in his books, 
and his petty sycophancy and treachery in his 
■career on the bench. And in lesser degree the 
paradox existed in Sidney, Spenser, and Shake- 
speare ; for all these men came with the Renais- 
sance and lived into the Reformation. It was no 
mere personal peculiarity, but something char- 
acteristic of the time; the great Queen herself 
was perhaps the most puzzling paradox of all. 

It is especially the relation these six bore to 
the Renaissance that most interests Mr. Lee. 
Each man represented some striking phase of 
this wonderful movement, and combined they 
practically make up its totality, taking the term 
Renaissance in its widest sense. More stood for 
its culture as comprehended by a man still 
within the church portals; Sidney embodied the 
personal charm of the courtier and the enthu- 
siasm of the man of letters; Raleigh was the 
product of the spirit of adventure with its 
unquenchable desire to discover new worlds; 
Spenser gave expression to the newly awakened 
sense of form and color, of Greek sensuousness 
and media3val chivalry; Bacon was the great 
apostle of those who took all knowledge to be 
their province; and Shakespeare incarnated all 
these human activities and aspirations in the 
men and women of his dramas. 

The last two chapters of Mr. Lee's book are 



a popular and brief presentation of his Life of 
Shakespeare. The first, on Shakespeare's career, 
shows again that his life is not a tissue of 
uncertainties and conjectures, spun by pseudo- 
scholarship from the sonnets and the plays. 
The subject of the last chapter, the foreign 
influences on Shakespeare, was evidently chosen 
to show how the New Learning affected liter- 
ature in one specific case, as well as to show 
how Shakespeare, as it were, gathered up into 
his work all the phases of this new learning. 
The last chapter is thus in a measure the com- 
plement of the first. The mere matter of the 
chapter is familiar enough. We have all heard 
over and over again of the little Latin and less 
Greek, of the superficial French, of the influence 
of Ovid, and the rest. Yet these facts are 
worth noting, because they show, as perhaps 
nothing else so well can, that the spirit of the 
Renaissance was not local, that it was diffused 
throughout Western Europe, and that, as Mr. 
Lee says, it is to this diffusion of the Renais- 
sance and the personal preeminence of Shake- 
speare's genius and intuition that we must look 
if we would understand any part of Shake- 
speare's work. James W. Tuppee.

That book is recalled just now by another, also 
the work of an Englishwoman whose name is 
completely unfamiliar to lis, which possesses a 
similar note of distinction, and has a theme 
which turns out to be the same, if we consider

that theme in terms common to both works

nothing more than an illusion imposed upon 
our senses. It is all the world there is for most 
people, but a few have the spiritual insight to 
perceive its shadowy nature. With such people, 
if they have the purpose to live lives to some 
degree corresponding with reality, the ordering 
of conduct becomes subject to new and uncon- 
ventional laws; the motives upon which most 
men act appear absurdly inadequate, and the 
goals for which they strive are seen to be not 
worth the seeking. Such people go through life 
as strangers to their fellows, and are by them 
set down as impracticable visionaries. Any 
attempt to bring the two books into a closer 
or more concrete resemblance than this would 
fail, for they are widely different in all their 
details. Miss Sinclair gives us a study of the 
poetic temperament; Miss TJnderhill presents 
for our contemplation the temperament of the 
mystic. Her hero is introduced, moreover, in 
startling fashion. He is a child of the London 
slums, lying at the age of ten years upon his 
death-bed in a hospital. His life flickers and 
goes out, and he finds himself in ' The Gray 
WorkP — for this is the book's title — among 
the company of disembodied spirits, blown 
about a world of which they are ever cognizant, 
but which has suddenly become curiously 
intangible. To the ghost of this particular 
boy, this is a most horrible condition of exist- 
ence, and so, by putting forth all his power 
of volition, he escapes from it and is bom again, 
this time into a life of suburban respectability 
and materialism. But as he grows up for the 
second time, he is h-aunted by memories of the 
shadowy interregnimi between his two lives, and 
also recalls distinctly his earlier incarnation. 
A few attempts to impart his strange knowl- 
edge to others result in such a mingling of 
incredulity and suspicion that he soon learns to 
keep such thoughts to himself, and to pretend 
a belief in the game of life and an interest in 
its moves. But all the time he knows a truth 
that none about him can comprehend, and this 
knowledge is reducible to the two essential pro- 
positions that the actual world is unreal and 
that the real ' gray ' world, as he remembers 
it, offers a most dreadful alternative. So he 
gropes upward into the years of early manhood, 
solitary, viewed askance, yearning for human 
sympathy and for some ideal means of escape 
from the obsession of a haunting recollection. 
He is eventually led to contemplate translation 
into the real world with some degree of hope- 
fulness, for the belief is gradually borne in 
upon him that what the soul takes with it out 
of the world of illusion determines the satisfac- 
tion with which life is adjusted to the condi- 
tions of reality. The agencies which work this 
change of attitude are art, the Catholic church, 
the example of St. Francis seen through the 



medium of the Umbrian landscape, and a high- 
ly spiritualized form of love. The following 
quotation will illustrate better than any words 
of description the style of the book, a style 
which, in its best moments, is fairly magical, 
although its effects are produced by the simplest 
means. The scene is the interior of a Catholic 
church in London, looked upon for the first 
time by the protaganist of this story of mystic- 
ism: 

'He looked down the long aisles. They were 
misty, half lighted by colored windows in the south. 
Far away, he saw lights burning, and persons who 
knelt by them. It all seemed to him profoundly 
unnatural. He felt as if he had penetrated to the 
home of a race of beings not entirely human — an 
unsuspected world within the world. A woman 
passed by him. In the street, he would have known 
her for a very ordinary, well-behaving person, not 
to be suspected of vivid emotions. Here she was 
remote, magical; caught up by the strong love of 
the initiate. He watched her as she made the sign 
of the cross and knelt, very simply and without 
shame, before an altar. It seemed to him that she 
stayed there a long time; he dared not move because 
of the tension of her attitude. Presently she kissed 
the feet of a statue that stood there, and came 
away. Her face, as she passed Willie, was serious 
but very contented. No doubt she would go out 
into the foggy sunshine and take a hansom or the 
omnibus and go home; but her real Life had been in 
the moment when she kissed the image with a 
convinced sincerity which did not belong to Subur- 
bia and its gods. It was evident that great mat- 
ters happened in this building.' 

We are by no means sure that the writer has 
any notion of serving, in this and similar pas- 
sages, as the propagandist of any particular 
faith. Her creed appears to be expressed, if 
anywhere definitely, in the following words: 

*It seems so much easier, in these days, to live 
morally than to live beautifully. Lots of us man- 
age to exist for years without ever sinning against 
society, but we sin against loveliness every hour of 
the day. I don't think the crime is less great. 
Beauty, after all, is the visual side of goodness: it 
is Christ immanent in the world; and its crucifixion 
still goes on.' 

We fear lest we have given the impression that 
this book is as sombre as its title. It is intense- 
ly serious, no doubt, but it is also animated and 
even enlivened by touches of a highly effective 
humor. Indeed, its most striking characteristic 
is found in the fact that the writer has one 
eye constantly fixed upon the most concrete 
matters and incidents, while the other is as 
constantly engaged in exploring the spiritual 
depths, or in contemplating the eternal verities, 
of human existence. 

'Three Dukes,' by G. Ystridde, — this is a 
fantastic title and a puzzling name. The title 
is explained by reference to a Russian folk-song, 
and the name we shall infer, upon internal evi- 
dence, to be that of a woman. As already 
hinted at, the novel is one of Russian life, not 
the brilliant life of capital and court, nor the

melodramatic life of conspiracy and exile, but 
the life of a country estate far in the Russian 
interior, dominated by an eccentric nobleman 
of singular ideas and uncontrollable temper, 
and made sprightly by the intrusion of a self- 
possessed and charming English governess. The 
genuineness of the local coloring is undeniable, 
and the deft manipulation of both characters 
and incident shows unusual talent. These vir- 
tues of the story are offset by a rambling and 
incoherent structure, with hardly a vestige of 
a plot, and an ending which is not so much a 
conclusion as a breaking-off. The book has a 
charm which these defects almost serve to 
heighten, and the interest is kept up throughout, 
although we sometimes wonder why this should 
be the case. 

Mr. Eider Haggard has found in the epoch 
of the Crusades a new field for his romantic 
invention, and gives us, in ' The Brethren,' one 
of the best of his books. The courtly figure 
of Saladin, dear to us from the childhood days 
when we were entranced by ' The Talisman,' is 
revived almost in the spirit of Scott, and is the 
central object of interast in the present romance. 
A niece of the great Saracen, bom of the union 
between his sister and an English knight, has 
been nurtured in her father's home, and pro- 
tected by her two cousins, the 'brethren' of 
the tale. Saladin determines to gain possession 
of this young woman, and his emissaries are 
successful in ensnaring her and bearing her 
away from her English home. Thereupon the 
brethren, both loving her, follow her to the East, 
bent upon her rescue, and the romance is in 
full swing. Their adventures are many and 
exciting, and they are eventually successful, 
although the one who is doomed to disappoint- 
ment in his love remains in the East to do 
further battle for the Cross. Historically, the 
romance culminates with the siege and capture 
of Jerusalem by the infidel hosts, and the clem- 
ency of Saladin toward the inhabitants of the 
city, the result of the heroine's throwing herself 
at the feet of the conqueror with a plea for 
mercy. 

Romance of a sort made more familiar to 
us by recent writers is provided by Mr. Stanley 
Weyman's new book, 'The Abbess of Vlaye.' 
The period is that of Henry lY., who has just 
become reconciled with the Church and recog- 
nized as King of France, but is still far from 
having set his house in order. Particularly in 
the region of Perigord are conditions unsettled, 
and a certain turbulent Captain of Vlaye is 
having things much his own way. How the 
king's lieutenant restores order in that region, 
and incidentally wins domestic happiness, is 
related in a spirited and picturesque way by 
Mr. Weyman, whose invention never seems to 



fail him, and Avhose workmanship may be seen 
at its best in this performance. 

The psychology of South American politics 
is the matter which occupies Mr. Joseph 
Conrad's attention in ' ISTostromo,' the longest 
novel he has thus far produced. South America 
has provided a theme for many other works of 
fiction, but they have been almost without excep- 
tion performances of melodramatic or opera 
bouffe quality, making no attempt to look deeper 
than the picturesque surface of things, and 
offering no claim to be taken seriously as actual 
studies of life and character. Mr. Conrad, it 
need hardly be said, never writes anything that 
does not make a serious claim upon our atten- 
tion, and his books set a very high standard of 
diction, characterization, and penetrative 
observation. It is only upon the structural side 
that they are conspicuously lacking, and it 
must be admitted that readers of ' Nostromo,' 
although they will find in the book ample 
reward for their pains in perusing it, will often 
reach the point of exasperation at its lengthy 
analyses, its interminable dragging-out of inci- 
dent, and its frequent harking back to ante- 
cedent conditions. The scene is a republic on 
the west coast, conveniently indefinite of loca- 
tion. In this country an English family has 
long been settled, and has had for its stake the 
government concession of a silver mine, handed 
down from father to son, and entailing much 
disagreeable ' squeezing ' from successive presi- 
dents and dictators. The descendant to whom 
it has fallen when the present narrative opens 
is the first one to make it a really valuable 
property,' and in the development he becomes 
the greatest power in the state, enlisting foreign 
capital, building railroads, and carrying govern- 
ments upon his pay roll. A final desperate 
effort on the part of the greedy politicians to 
get control of the goose that lays this golden 
Q^g is the main feature of the plot, but, as was 
observed at the outset, the psychological interest 
predominates over the adventurous or romantic 
interest, which justifies the author in naming 
this novel after one of its characters — a minor 
character as far as the main action of the story 
is concerned, but the one upon whom Mr. 
Conrad has concentrated his analytical powers. 
The work is a very strong one, and we can think 
of no other writer, unless it be Mr. Cunning- 
ham-Grahame, who could have done anything 
like as well with the same material. 

We expect neither psychology nor any other 
kind of insight from Mr. S. R. Crockett, but 
we do expect, and generally get, an entertaining 
story of some sort. ' The Loves of Miss Anne ' 
is the latest of these fictions, and the setting is 
Scotch. Miss Anne is a minx who regards all 
men as fair game for her coquetry, and who

practices through four hundred pages upon as 
many as come within her reach. Her devices 
are sometimes desperately wicked, but she car- 
ries off her enterprises with a high hand, and 
never comes wholly to grief, although some- 
times dangerously close to its verge. Her story 
may be read with a good conscience, which is 
more than one can say of a good many of oui 
recent novels. 

Some months ago there was published in 
Oermany a novel by Herr August Niemann, 
entitled * Der Weltkrieg — Deutsche Traume.' 
This novel, translated by Mr. J. H. Freese, is 
310W published as ' The Conquest of England,' 
a more exactly descriptive title. For the 
^ dreams ' of the German, in the view of this 
author, are of overthrowing the English power, 
and of an imperial army taking triumphant 
possession of London. That some Germans 
entertain such dreams we imagine to be true; 
that they represent the real ambitions of the 
^eat heart of the German people we take leave 
to doubt and even to deny. Such a denial, of 
course, to be effective should come from the 
nation thus traduced, and we may mention in 
passing that it has recently been most vigor- 
ously voiced by Professor Paulsen. And surely, 
no wilder or more criminal ambition could be 
entertained by any serious German than that of 
destroying the power with which, above all 
others, Germany is marked out to march hand 
in hand toward a common goal of culture and 
civilization. But enough of this. The story, 
considered as a historical romance, is of a type 
familiar enough, and is related in a workman- 
like manner. The war is foreshadowed by an 
alliance of the powers inimical to England, and 
actually begins on the Afghan frontier. It ends, 
as we have before suggested^ with the German 
occupation of London and the division of the 
lion's spoils. It is a fairly good story, and 
is curiously interesting from the way in which 
it represents, upon every possible occasion, the 
point of view of the German anglophobe. 
Throughout it is taken for granted that England 
is the arch-enemy of civilization, that its foreign 
policy is a complex network of rapacity and 
hypocrisy, and that it is deaf to the voice of 
the higher idealism. To us, who know so well 
ihat this is the exact opposite of the truth, and 
that among modem nations England, whatever 
its faults or mistakes, stands upon a higher 
moral plane than any of its rivals, and is much 
more apt to subordinate expediency or self- 
interest to ethical principle — to us who know 
this the author is merely amusing in the display 
of his prejudiced animosity, but there is cause 
for some degree of serious reflection in the fact 
that such a book as this should have had the 
popular success that is reported from the coun- 
try of its origin. 



In reading * Morganatic,' Herr Max Nordau's 
latest work, due allowance must be made for 
the fact that the author is primarily a student 
of the political and social problems of modem 
civilization, and only incidentally a novelist. 
He has so wide an acquaintance with the cur- 
rents of contemporary thought and with the 
conditions of Continental society at the present 
time that his work, whatever form it may 
take, and despite its occasional flavor of 
sensationalism, cannot fail to be inter- 
esting, a proposition of which the novel at hand 
affords ample proof. While the work is open 
to criticism upon structural grounds, and while 
it exhibits no great skill in the penetration of 
character, it makes up for these defects by a 
rich variety of incident and a dramatic anima- 
tion of action. It is chiefly concerned with the 
efforts of a designing woman, the morganatic 
widow of an Austrian prince, to obtain for her- 
self and her son the social recognition that she 
believes to be their right, but that are denied 
them by the chief representatives of the family. 
It is a story of intrigue, of financial speculation, 
and of the life of aristocrats and operatic 
artists. The efforts of the princess, seconded 
in only a half-hearted way by her son, are com- 
pletely unsuccessful. She dies an embittered 
woman, and he takes refuge in a religious 
order. Our sympathetic interest centres about 
neither of these figures, but rather about that 
of a young girl of illegitimate birth and lyrical 
genius who makes a career for herself, softening 
animosities and overcoming prejudices by virtue 
of her marked and charming individuality. 

* Bethany,' by Mr. Thomas E. Watson, is a 
book which describes Southern life, and 
Georgian life in particular, during the years 
immediately preceding the Civil War. It also 
includes scenes from the earlier years of the 
struggle itself, and ends with the battle of 
Gettysburg. It is related in the first person, 
and is apparently a novel of a rambling sort, 
although the element of truth is much larger 
than the element of invention. It presents the 
Confederate point of view with much plausi- 
bility, and such leaders as Toombs, Yancey, 
and Stephen speak for themselves and their 
cause at great length. It pretends to be a book 
of boyish memories of the persons and scenes 
described, and is in this respect essentially 
genuine, although as a matter of fact the author 
(who was born in 1856) would have had to be 
a few years older to be an intelligent eye-witness 
of the matters concerning which he writes. The 
fire-eating Southerner has not often been exhib- 
ited, in either history or fiction, more truthfully 
and vividly than in the present work. One 
paragraph in the apologetic preface seems to 
demand a word of comment. Mr. Watson 
writes : * When it shall have gradually dawned

upon all Northern writers that the Southern 
States in 1860 did no more than exercise a 
right which had been almost universally con- 
ceded from the founding of the Government — 
a right in which the seceders believed, and which 
provocation seemed to call for the use of — 
then, perhaps, we shall have historical literature 
which does not stigmatize us as rebels and our 
leaders as traitors/ We are willing to grant 
that the argument for secession was a strong 
one, and that secession itself was carried out 
with strict regard for legality, but what pos- 
sible defense can be offered by the author or 
anyone else for the conduct of those leaders 
who had taken a solemn oath to support the 
Constitution, and who in 1860-61 deliberately 
violated that oath? We are not overfond of 
using the words ' rebel ' and ' traitor,' but that 
application to the leaders in question seems 
strictly legitimate, and in the case of these men, 
whatever we may think of others, the excuse 
of a divided allegiance is the merest sophistry. 
We fear that Mr. Watson is still sadly in need 
of reconstruction. 

If our sympathies enable us to make a gen- 
erous allowance for the influence of Southern 
birth and environment in expressing our opinion 
of Mr. Watson's book, there is no reason why 
we should extend them sufficiently to cover the 
work of a Northerner like Mr. Emerson Hough. 
'The Law of the Land,' viewed as a piece of 
literary workmanship, is far superior to ' Beth- 
any,' but its argument is inexcusably pernicious. 
The author plants himself squarely upon the 
right of the white Southerner to deny everj' 
kind of right to the black, and thereby makes 
himself an apologist for the lawlessness with 
which the race question is handled throughout 
the South, The most overbearing acts of license 
and violence are condoned, and every suggestion 
of philanthropic endeavor to improve the con- 
dition of the negro is made the subject of a 
sneer. Of course, being a skilful novelist, Mr. 
Hough so shapes his story as to make a strong 
appeal for the enlistment of our sympathies in 
the cause for which he argues, and he has the 
further advantage of fixing his scene (although 
somewhat vaguely) in the reconstruction period, 
when negro domination threatened the very 
existence of civilization in many a Southern 
commonwealth. But for all that, his main 
position is untenable, by any other logic than 
that of the emotions, for it resolves itself into 
proclaiming that the powers of law may properly 
be set aside whenever, in the opinion of the 
white element of population, they do not operate 
to keep the negro in his place — - the definition 
of that ' place ' being left unreservedly to the 
white man's discretion. 

We approach a new detective story with many 
misgivings, because long experience has taught 



ua that their mysteries, when finally revealed, 
are both cheap and artificial, while many minor 
matters, introduced to whet the curiosity, are 
neglected altogether in the final edaircisse- 
ment. Of ' The Marathon Mystery,' by Mr. 
Burton Stevenson, we may however say that 
the workmanship is exceedingly deft, and that 
in neither of the respects above mentioned is 
it open to serious criticism. The mystery is- 
no more artificial than need be, and the details 
of the plot all turn out to be important cog* 
in the mechanism. This story is distinctly 
better than ' The Holladay Case,' to which it 
is in some respects a sequel. 

' The Private Tutor,' by Mr, Gamaliel Brad- 
ford, Jr., is an amateurish production, without 
much to tell in the way of a story, but having 
some very pretty pages descriptive of Eome, 
where the action is laid, ' Glorified Baedeker 
or liare ' would do fairly well as a character- 
ization of these pages, which are the result of 
a sympathetic intimacy with the scenes 
described. The hero, if we may so style him, 
is a pleasant young fellow, an artist manque, 
whom fate has placed in charge of the graceless 
son of an American millionaire during a Euro- 
pean trip. The father hopes that the boy will 
get culture, or character, or something of the 
sort from the tour, but the hope is manifestly 
vain. He turns out to be so mean, so vulgar. 
and so impossibly disgusting, that it is diffi- 
cult to take his figure seriously as a study of 
any conceivable kind of real humanity. In 
fact, the author exhibits no power of character- 
ization worth mentioning, either in this case or 
in. any other, and therein is the essential failure 
of his novel. This defect is hardly to be offset 
by style and observation, which qualities are in 
fair measure his. William Morton Payne,

of a famous much neglected episode in Amer-

given us by Mr. Josiah H. Benton, Jr., in 'A 
Notable Libel Case: The Criminal Prosecution of 
Theodore Lyman, Jr., by Daniel Webster, in the 
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Novem- 
ber Term, 1828' (Boston: Charles E. Goodspeed). 
The trial here described was on an indictment 
alleging that Lyman had charged Webster with 
having conspired with other leading Federalists 
in 1807-08 to break up the Union on account of 
the Embargo Acts, and to re-annex the New 
England States to the mother country. The 
defendant was an ex-mayor of Boston, and a man 
of the highest social and political standing. He 
was, however, an enemy of John Quincy Adams, 
and during the campaign of 1828 he became one 
of the proprietors of a semi-weekly jiewspaper.

tlie ^Jacksou Republican/ whose one aim was to 
defeat Adams iu his race for reelection to the 
Presidency. The charge against Senator "Web- 
ster, which became the ground of the ease against 
Lyman, was printed in this, sheet, October 29, 
1828. Twelve days later, Webster, through his 
counsel, presented the charge as a criminal libel 
to the Gi-and Jury in the Supreme Judicial Court, 
and this body at once retui'ued an indictment. 
This indictment itself was an imusual document, 
being based on a principle of English Star-Cham- 
ber prosecutions never adopted as a part of the 
common law of the United States; and by em- 
ploying the method of a criminal prosecution 
rather than a civil action, Mr. Webster clearly 
put his opponent at a sei'ious disadvantage. The 
trial, which began December 16, ai'oused greater 
jxjpular interest and called out a more brilliant 
display of legal oratorj' than Boston had known 
in a generation. But the outcome was only that 
the jury failed to agree, and the case was con- 
tinued until the March term, 1829, whence it was 
continued again until the November teim. When 
November came, the Solicitor-General proclaimed 
that inasmuch as every resource had been ex- 
hausted at the ti-ial of the year before, public 
justice did not require that the case be tried a 
second time; and it was therefore dismissed. *It 
is difficult to believe,' says Mr. Benton, 'that Mr. 
Webster himself thought it necessary for his per- 
sonal or official vindication to institute this 
extraordinai-y prosecution. He was doubtless 
induced to do it only as a part of the bitter 
jK>litical contest then being waged between the 
friends of Adams and of Jackson. The subse- 
quent conduct of Mr. Lyman toward Mr. Web- 
ster shows that he considered the case as really 
political and not personal on the pai't of Mr. 
Webster. The trial for the time interrupted the 
previous intimate social relations between Web- 
ster and L\-man, but in a year or two they became 
reconciled, and remained warm pereonal friends 
through life.' The histoi-y of the episode is well 
worked out by Mr. Benton, and letters and other 
documentaiy materials are so skilfully employed 
in the text that the story almost tells itself from 
the records. The monograph is admirably printed 
and contains five excellent engravings. 



Vp-to-date To keep really up-to-date in a 

knowledge of knowledge of the Roman Forum 
the Forum. jg ^ ^.^j.^, difficult matter. Although 
one of the oldest places in Roman history, it 
has been so long buried that it is one of the 
newest topographically, the last sis years having 
done more to uncover and explain its ancient 
monuments than all the eailier centuiies together 
had done before. So many have been the revela- 
tions of pick and spade during this time that the 
traveller returning after only a few years of 
absence feels himself quite a stranger in the once 
familiar spot. It seems, and is, much larger 
than as he remembers it, several modem 
encroachments— a row of dwellings, a street-car 
track, a church, a convent, and a garden— hav- 
ing been banished. Underaeath where they once 
stood are the remains of ancient basilicas, 



shrines, temples and tombs, beside one old cem- 
etery which clearly dates back before Romulus, 
before the Forum itself, to the time when the 
Seven Hills were occupied by tribes of shepherds 
only. Official reports have been made of these 
things (in Italian) by the Director of Excava- 
tions, Commendatore Boni. Professor Hiilsen 
has published (in German) a large pamphlet 
which furnishes many technical details, measure- 
ments, and the like. But the average English 
or American traveller has very much needed a 
smaller work, of equal accuracy but more pop- 
ular and practicable, as a guide among these 
new-old stones and pillars and pavements. Such 
a book is now to be had in Mr. St. Clair Bad- 
deley's 'Recent Discoveries in the Forum, 1898- 
1901' (Macmillan). The author has been in 
close touch with all the work as it went on, and 
fommately has seen fit to give us many inci- 
dents of the eventful days, and illustrations 
showing the scenes of transition. For example^ 
the fi-ontispiece shows in the process of demoli- 
tion the shabby house which for yeai"s had 
crowded the beautiful Temple of Faustina and 
covered the spot under which was soon to be 
found the magnificent inscription and comer- 
stone of the ancient Basilica Emilia; another 
picture shows the section of the Sacra Via which 
had to be saciificed to reveal the tomb of 
Romulus. These are the things that being left 
uni'ecorded are sure to be soon forgotten, yet 
which everyone would wish to know. The book 
is interesting beyond the rule of guide-books; 
the map is excellent, and the forty-five illustra- 
tions are well-chosen. One is puzzled, however, 
to find in a book about the Forum an accovmt 
of the recent discovery of the Altur of Peace in 
the Campus Martins. Although interesting in 
itself, it has surely no right to a place in this, 
book, and chi a page whose caption is 'The 
Forum.' The Altar of Peace is one of the great 
memorials of the Augustan Age in Rome, but it 
is a part of the story of the Campus Martins and 
not of the Forum Romanum.

is written in 'The Garden that I Love'— the 
Poet's home— and is therefore laiglish in atmos-

even a poet laureate, can always attain perfec-

purpose in accentuating the mei-its of the more

harmless banalities, his readers may be impelled,

A novel A novel experiment in American 
municipal municipal activities, as interesting 
experiment. ^g ^^ ^ unusual, is described in the 
volume edited by Mr. Charles Gr. Hall and entitled 
'The Cincinnati Southern Railway: A History.' 
The account of the building of the road, coming 
as it does from several pens, is neither so clear 
nor concise as could be wished, but it appears that 
the need of a railway connecting Cincinnati with 
the South was felt with such poignancy as long- 
ago as 1836 that a mass meeting Avas held in the 
western metropolis of that day and a round mil- 
lion of dollars subscribed for the enterprise— a 
huge sum for that time. Delay followed delay, 
the aid of the legislature was sought, and the 
enterprise was at last on its feet when the Civil 
War put in the background every consideration 
except the possibilities of a militaiy road. An- 
other seiTies of delays and disappointments fol- 
lowed the wai', but authorization was finally 
obtained, not only from the legislature of Ohio 
but from those of Kentucky and Tennessee, and 
in 1873 the actual construction of the road began 
with money lent by its trustees from their own 
pockets. In July, 1877, the first division of the 
road was opened for business. Many millions 
of dollars were raised by the sale of bonds, and 
the present situation finds the road in possession 
of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific 
Railway Company as lessee, the trustees of the 
Cincinnati Southern holding the legal title in 
trust for the city of Cincimiati. The lease, which 
was for a period of twenty-five years, expires in 
1906, and the leasing and operating corporation 
is now paying about $1,100,000 a year for its use 
of the property. Whether or not a new lease will 
be made is a matter now open for discussion. The 
book is profusely illustrated with scenes along 
the road, portraits of officials and others, views 
of business houses in cities on the route, and 
similar material. . 

Love affairs Readers of Fanny Kemble's 'Rec-

bachelor. sundry rather tantalizing refer- 

ences to certain interesting complications of a sen- 
timental nature, in which the artist Lawrence and 
Mrs. Siddons's two elder daughters, Sally and 
Maria, were involved. Mrs. Kemble, writing from 
l-emembrance based on hearsay, and years after 



the events, is not quite accurate in her state- 
ments; and so perhaps it is well to have such a' 
full and apparently trustworthy account of the 
matter as is now given in 'An Artist's Love 
Story' (Long-mans), as told, with the help of 
some hitherto unpublished letters from the chief 
characters concerned, by Mr. Oswald G. Knapp. 
That Lawrence was an incorrigible flirt, and that 
the whole story of his successive entanglements 
and disentanglements with Sally and Maria is a 
paltry enough chronicle, cannot be denied; but 
the prominence of some of the actors in this little 
tragi-comedy, and the amiable qualities of the two 
beautiful and ill-fated sistei-s, give the affair a 
certain dignity and pathos. Both girls died early 
of consiunption, and the fascinating Tom Law- 
rence, after breaking no one knows how many 
hearts, himself died an old bachelor. Two i)or- 
traits that are printed of Maria Siddons, as 
being both by Lawrence, are remarkable for their 
entire lack of resemblance to each other. Other 
portraits, including the familiar National Gallerj- 
painting of Mrs. Siddons by Lawrence, are also 
given, and a few autographs in facsimile. 



An episode in 'Wadsworth, or The Charter Oak,* 
Connecticut is the title of a book written and 
history. published by Mr. William H. 

Gocher, of Hartford, Connecticut. It purports 
to give all that is ascertainable relating to the 
hiding of the colonial charter, in 1687, in the 
famous oak tree at Hartford,— an incident of 
which Captain Joseph Wadsworth, according to 
doubtful tradition, was the hero. The motive of 
the deed, it will be remembered, was to keep the 
charter out of the hands of Andros, the newly 
appointed governor of all New England, who 
demanded its sun-ender in the King's name. Mi-. 
Gocher has shown commendable antiquarian zeal 
in prosecuting his researches ; yet his readers will 
probably wish he had not chosen to weave fact 
and fiction into the same web in a book that pro- 
fesses to be history rather than a novel. Wads- 
worth himself is made to tell the story of the 
charter and its hiding, in language that is undis- 
guisedly hodiernal, and with many interpolations 
of matter remotely or not at all connected with 
the main theme. The chapters on the Royal Oak, 
on Cromwell, and on the Regicides, are of this 
irrelevant nature. The wording, and still more 
the spelling, of Joseph Wadsworth 's will, which 
is printed in full, are so strikingly in contrast 
with the modernity of his supposed narrative, 
that not the faintest touch of illusion can cling 
to the latter. But the author frankly indicates 
in his introduction the true nature of what is to 
follow. 'By blending fact and fancy,' he says, 
'it is possible to weave a narrative which enter- 
tains and at the same time instructs the reader. 
Those who believe it can; those who doubt it 
may;— so let it go at that.' There is reason to 
believe, as readers of the book would do well to 
bear in mind, that the original charter^ was 
secreted, possibly in the oak tree of tradition, 
some time before Andros 's arrival at Hart- 
ford, and that a duplicate figured in the historic 
scene in the council chamber. For a plain

aecouat of the mattex" chapter sixteen of San- 
ford's 'EBistoiy of Connecticut' may be consulted. 
Mr. Gocher's work is lavishly illustrated from 
old prints, old portraits, and modem photographs, 
and is provided with numerous footnotes bearing 
evidence of painstaking research. 

■In edition The appearance of each new 

de huce of volume from the Department of 

the 'GeorgicB.' Limited Editions at the Riverside 
Press seizes to strengthen our conviction that 
Mr. Rogers's work represents the highwater 
mark, so far as this country is concerned, in fine 
printing at the present time. The Department 
is now installed in a building of its own, with 
its own special facilities in the way of material 
and workmen ; the printing will hereafter be done 
on hand presses, and from the type itself rather 
than from electrotype plates as heretofore. This 
is all as it should be, and that the new conditions 
will have a marked effect for good is evidenced 
by the latest volume from the Press,— a reprint 
of the 'Geoi^es' of Virgil, in Mr. J. W. Mac- 
kail's fine translation. The book is octavo in size, 
printed on handmade paper from a font of old- 
style italics, with the antique 'swash' capitals, 
and is bound in decorated board covers with vel- 
lum back. A charming outline drawing, of classic 
flavor, is printed in brown at the beginning of each 
of the four books, there is a graceful panel design 
for the title-page, and each paragraph has a small 
decorative initial. But the decorative features 
are here, as in all the Riverside Press books, 
entirely subordinate to the typ(^aphy; unlike 
most of the others who are attempting to do 
what he has done, Mr. Rogers has no need to 
employ garish decoration as a means of diverting 
attention from crudities of workmanship. The 
marked distinction of his work is the result of an 
observance of sound typ<^raphical principles, 
combined with a certain amoimt of conservative 
individual initiative, and an intelligent sense of 
artistic fitness. The 'Georgics' may be regarded 
as one of his most successful efforts. 



The story In 'The Story of Wireless Teleg- 

of Wireless raphy' (Appleton), Mr. A. T. Story 

Telegraphy. j^g^ presented a subject of great 
and growing imj>ortance in such a manner that 
the reader without technical knowledge can fol- 
low the narrative from beginning to end, and at 
the close emerge from his reading with a fair 
conception of what has been accomplished even 
on the technical side. The steps leading to Sig- 
nor Marconi's reduction to practice of the knowl- 
edge existing before him are detailed, but with 
the emphasis still left upon the condition of 
the art today. It is curious to note that Pro- 
fessor Morse himself was successful in using nm- 
ning water as a conductor for a telegraphic cur- 
rent in experiments going back to 1842. The 
share of Americans generally in the investiga- 
tions leading to the present triumphs is made 
quite clear, and the book closes with an accoxmt 
of Professor Fessenden's apparatus. There are 
numerous illustrations, whereby the method of 
operation may be learned, and there is a satis- 
faetnrv index. 



A new book Lad}' Aug^ta Gregory continues 
of iriah legends her efforts for the p)opularization 
and folk-lore. ^f i^^^^^ legends with a second vol- 
ume, 'Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the 
Tuatha de Danaan and of the Fianna of Ire- 
land' (imported by Seribner). The volume is a 
companion to 'Cuchulain of Muirthemne,' which 
it resembles in style and treatment. From the 
most miscellaneous sources, some written but 
more oral. Lady Gregory has collected fragments 
of ancient tales of the gods and demigods, piecing 
them together into a mosaic wherein the joints 
are skDfully concealed, and telling them in the 
sort of English used by the Irish peasantry, with 
quaint idioms of the Erse literally translated 
and a general air of exoticism which is most allur- 
ing. Mr. William Butler Yeats has written an 
introduction for the book, and Lady Gregory pre- 
pares a series of appendices which are valuable 
to the beginner,— one of them particularly so, for 
it tells how to pronounce the proper names run- 
ning through the narrative. Physically, the book 
is a handsome one, with a cover design of more 
than usual merit. 



Notes. 



An informal review, by Prof. Goldwin Smith, of 
Mr. Morley's Life of Gladstone will be publiahed 
immediately by the A. Weasels Co. 

A volume by Bishop Potter setting forth in full 
his much-discussed views on the temperance ques- 
tion is announced by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

'Some Principles of Literary Criticism and Their 
Application to the Synoptic' Problem,' by Prof. 
Ernest DeWitt Burton, is a late addition to the 
'Decennial Publications' of the University of 
Chicago. 

A reprint of a hitherto unknown poem by Samuel 
Rowlands, entitled 'The Bride,' made from the 
unique copy in the Harvard College Library, will 
be issued this month by Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed 
of Boston. 

A reprint of Sylvester Judd's account of Hadley, 
Massachusetts, one of the most valuable of New 
England town histories, is projected by Messrs. H. 
R. Huntting & Co., Springfield, Mass. The edition 
will be limited. 

An edition of Ben Jonson's 'Bartholomew Fair,'

raphies,' published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

A new edition of the Hon. William L. Scruggs 's 
'The Colombian and Venezuelan Republics,' made

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Still another new magazine devoted to outdoor 
life, the country home, and similar matters, will 
make its appearance within a month or two. It is 
to be called 'The Country Calendar,' and will bo 
issued from the office of 'The E-eview of Eeviews.' 

'The Little Plowers of St. Francis of Assisi, ' 
translated into English verse by Mr. James 
Ehoades, is a handsomely printed volume just pub- 
lished by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. The trans- 
lation is in blank verse, and there are three charm- 
ing prefatory sonnets, 

Mr. G. W. E. Eussell's life of Sidney Smith will 
appear in the 'English Men of Letters' series this 
spring; and so will biographies of two Americans — 
Mr. William A. Bradley's life of Bryant, and Dr. 
Harry Thurston Peck's account of William Hickling 
Prescott. 

' The Eetreat of a Poet Naturalist, ' by Miss Clara 
Barrus, is an account of the country home of Mr. 
John Burroughs, at West Park, New York. It is 
issued in tasteful pamphlet form by the Poet Lore 
Co., as the first number in a series called 'Poet Lore 
Brochures, ' 

An addition to Champlin's popular series of 
'Young Folks' Cyclopedias,' the first volume of 
which appeared a quarter-century ago, will be pub- 
lished by Messrs. Holt & Co. in April. Natural His- 
tory is the subject of the new volume, and Mr, 
Champlin has been assisted in its preparation by 
Mr. Frederic A. Lucas. 

Two important additions have just been made to 
the Columbia University 'Studies in History, 
Economics, and Public Law.' They are 'Pre-Mal- 
thusian Doctrines of Population,' by Dr. Charles 
Emil Stangeland, and 'History and Criticism of 
the Labor Theory of Value in English Political 
Economy,' by Dr. Albert C. Whitaker. 

'The Burlington Magazine,' under its new Amer- 
ican piiblisher, Mr. Eobert Grier Cooke, continues to 
maintain the highest standards in its field. The 
leading article in the January issue is devoted to a 
description, by Mr. A. H. Smith, of the sculpture at 
Lansdowne House, illustrated with several fine 
reproductions. 

A volume on Samuel de Champlain, by Mr. Nar- 
cisse E, Dionne, will be added this month to the 
'Makers of Canada' series, published by Messrs. 
Morang & Co., Toronto. This series of biographies, 
in many ways the most important publishing enter- 
prise yet undertaken in Canada, will be complete in 
twenty volumes, six of which have now appeared. 

In response to a demand from members of various 
university faculties, the Messrs, Harpers are pre- 
paring a special 'University Edition' of their 
important twenty-eight volume history, 'The Amer- 
ican Nation,' five volumes of which have so far 
appeared. This edition will contain exactly the 
same text, but will be issued in simpler and more 
suitable form for college use. 

From Herr J. C. Heinriehs, Leipzig (imported by 
Stechert), we have 'The Songs of an Egyptian 
Peasant,' as collected and translated into German 
by Herr Heinrich Schaef er, and from German into 
English by Miss Frances Hart Breasted. The orig- 
inal text of the songs, an Egyptian dialect of Arabic, 
is given with the translation, and the book is charm- 
ingly illustrated. 

A memorial to the poet Edward Eowland Sill has 
recently been unveiled at Oakland, California. It 
is in the form of a bronze sun-dial, mounted on a 
granite base, and is the gift of three classes of the 
Oakland High School, where Sill was a teacher for 
a short time. The publishers of Sill's works, 



Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., have for some time 
past held out promises of a complete edition of his 
poems in a single convenient volume. It is to be 
hoped on all accounts that such an edition may be 
given us, 

Mr. W, D. Moffat and Mr, Eobert S, Yard, both 
of whom for several years past have occupied prom- 
inent positions in the house of Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons, have now gone into publishing on 
their own account, under the corporate title of 
Moffat, Yard & Company. They have also formed a 
business alliance with the publishers of 'Town and 
Country,' in which periodical they have acquired 
an interest. 

The reprint of the Baron de Lahontan 's ' New 
Voyages to North America, ' which Messrs, MeClurg 
& Co. have had in preparation for some time past, 
is now definitely announced for publication this 
month. In many ways this will form the most 
attractive work in Messrs. McClurg's series of 
Americana reprints; for, in addition to its historical 
value, the narrative of this gay soldier of fortune 
possesses an intrinsic charm and interest altogether 
lacking in the relations of his austerer fellow-ex- 
plorers of the late seventeenth century. The 
edition is in two octavo volumes, with introduction, 
notes, and index by Dr. E^uben Gold Thwaites. 

From the Library of Congress we have just 
received two publications of exceptional importance. 
One of them is a reprint of Justin Winsor's mono- 
graph on 'The Kohl Collection of Maps relating to 
America,' first published by Harvard University 
in 1886. The collection which it concerns has 
recently been transferred from the Department of 
State to the Library of Congress. The other pub- 
lication is Volume I. of the 'Journal of the Con- 
tinental Congress,' now to be for the first time 
printed in full. It is expected that this work will 
occupy about fifteen volumes, and that the publi- 
cation will require several years. It is edited by 
Mr. Worthington C. Ford, and has numerous illus- 
trations in facsimile.

By STANLEY J. WEYMAN, Author of "Under the

Rotha," " The Red Cockade," etc. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

" The scene in the next to the last chapter, in which the Abbess 
and her Captain sit at table together considering their plans, is 
developed by the author with all his art, and we count it among 
his most brilliant achievements." — Tribune (New York). 

" Superior even to ' Under the Red Robe ' and • A Gentleman 
of France.' . . . A marked and skilful feature is that it rises con- 
stantly toward a climax ; indeed, the last part of the book is not- 
ably stronger than the earlier part." — Evening Post (New York). 

" One has to go back to ' Under the Red Robe ' to recall its 
equal." — The Press (New York). 

"Never has this prince of romance so signally demonstrated 
his wonderful creative ability as has been accomplished by this 
remarkable human-interest story, with its matchless character 
delineations and exciting situations and episodes. Unquestionably 
it is the romance of the year." — The American (New York). 

" One of the very best he has written." — The Press (Detroit). 

" A dramatic and spectacular dinonement, which is as unex- 
pected as it is sudden and which comes about from a source care- 
fully prepared by the novelist, but of which there is no hint at all 
until the blow falls. Indeed, Mr. Weyman never devised a more 
dramatic climax." — Eagle (Brooklyn). 

" In his chosen field Mr. Weyman has not been surpassed in 
our time." — Record-Herald (Chicago).

with keen interest the story of Frances Carey." — Evening Sun 
(New York). 

" . . . is a good novel. It belongs to that large, successful 
and unconspicuous class of novel which tells a good, domestic 
story, with some tragic undercurrentc, in a live, natural, and well- 
filled environment of ordinary polite society, and without anything 
in it far fetched, extravagant or melodramatic enough to foist it 
into notoriety. . . . With this book Lady Ridley joins the rank 
of Miss Braddon or Rhoda Broughtou, with some qualities which 
place her above it." — Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

1^ and Hedges," etc. Crown Svo, $1.50. 

" . . . it is a joy to fall occasionally upon a novel like ' The

"^ I ^HE gay young baron's power of observing man and nature were highly 
-^ developed ; unfettered by religious or political bias, he was a free lance 
in these particulars; he impartially judged both priest and official; his humor

style, especially in the famous semi-satirical Dialogue with Adario, in the

The Dial's opinion of " The Divine 
Fire " has the unanimous confirination 
of the critics. 

The Dial said : " It has real distinction of style, 
and is of absorbing interest from cover to cover." 

Baron de Bookworms in Punch said : " Judged 
by almost every standard to which a comedy like 
this should be referred, I find her book the most 
remarkable I have read for many years." 

The Bookman. — " One of those rare books . . . 
of very unusual quality." 

The N. Y. Tribune. — " Breathlessly interest- 
ing. ... It ought to give May Sinclair at once 
high rank among the novelists of the day. . . . 
A novel which it is a pleasure to praise." 

The N. Y. Sun. — " A copious, varied and finely 
drawn history." 

Life. — "Rich in beauty and interest, its chief 
fault being one of spendthrift generosity, induced 
by the gift of an almost lyric prose." 

The Nation. — "The hero is extremely inter- 
esting." 

The N. Y. Times Review. — " One of the best 
novels of the season which give the best promise 
of outlasting it." 

The Boston Transcript. — " It is rare indeed to 
come across a novel in which there is so much 
genuine greatness."

A PRINCE OF INTERVIEWERS. 

* Who is this Scotch cur at Johnson's heels? ' 
asked some one. * He is not a cur/ replied 
Goldsmith; 'he is only a bur. Tom Davies 
flung him at Johnson in sport, and he has the 
faculty of sticking.' 

It has been the fashion, even among John- 
son's warmest admirers, to belittle and ridicule 
the man to whose unique achievement in pen- 
portraiture that very admiration owes its being. 
Macaulay, in a paragraph that exhausts the 
vocabulary of contempt, calls him ' one of the 
smallest men that ever lived ' and ' a man of 
the meanest and feeblest intellect' — just after 
he has extolled the small man's book as so far 
superior to all others of its class as to have no 
second. Indeed, according to Macaulay (the 
dictum is now a household word) it was pre- 
cisely because Boswell was such a fool that he 
was so good a biographer. The absurdity of 
this extreme view of the case is too patent to 
call for comment, not to speak of the utter 
unlikelihood that a man of Johnson's vigorous 
understanding and sturdy self-respect would 
have not merely tolerated, but ^tually enter- 
tained a warm affection for, a p^HlVa so devoid of 
all claim to his esteem. With the master himself 
we may laugh at the comicalities of his disciple, 
but it would be taking an unfair advantage of 
the man's frank portrayal of his own absurdities 
to deny him any higher qualities than flatulent 
conceit and abject sycophancy. 

Let us, if we choose, credit all that has been 
said of Boswell's delightfully naive exhibition 
of his own idiosyncrasies. Miss Bumey has 
described his worshipful attention whenever the 
great Doctor began to speak. At such times 
Boswell so concentrated his entire thought and 
energy upon his idol that he would not even 
answer questions from others. His eyes goggled 
with eagerness, his listening ear almost touched 
the Doctor's shoulder, his mouth fell ajar as if 
to drink in every slightest syllable, and. he ap- 
peared to listen to the great man's very breath- 
ings as if they had some mystical meaning. He 
took every opportunity to edge himself close to 
Johnson's side, even at table, and was some- 
times ordered imperiously back to his place like 
a faithful but obtrusive spaniel. In his desire 
to form his mind after the Johnsonian model, 
he went so far at times as to out- Johnson the 
original. His assumption of a more than John- 
sonian contempt for women is indicated in a 
replv to Mrs. Knowles, the Quaker, who had 
expressed a hope that the sex^ would be equal 



142

[March 1, 



in another world. ' That is too ambitious/ he 
said. ' We might as well desire to be equal with 
the angels.' Even the Johnsonese idiom he suc- 
ceeded to some extent in making his own. When 
a distinction was drawn between moral and 
physical necessity, Boswell thus expounded the 
matter, — ' Alas, sir, they come both to the same 
thing. You may be as hard bound by chains 
when covered by leather as when the iron ap- 
pears.' It was an odd freak of his that once 
made him refrain from writing to Jobnson for 
a long time, to see whether his correspondent 
would finally be induced to write first. The 
older man grew uneasy at this strange silence, 
though he shrewdly suspected its cause, and 
upon Boswell's confession gave him a piece of 
his mind. * Remember that all tricks are knav- 
ish or childish, and that it is as foolish to make 
experiments upon the constancy of a friend as 
upon the chastity of a wife.' A comical aping 
of his master's exemplary morality reveals itself 
now and then. Wliile suffering grievous prick- 
ings of conscience for what he admits to have 
l)een highly reprehensible conduct, he allays 
the smart by summoning up pictures of his 
future blameless deportment. Viewing himself 
as already reformed for the rest of his days, he 
glows mth prospective virtue and thus rhap- 
sodizes in a letter to his friend Temple, who had 
sent him a bit of excellent advice, — ' My warm 
imagination looks forward with great com- 
placency on the sobriety, the healthfulness, and 
worth of my future life.' The pious platitudes 
that sprinkle his pages are highly amusing, 
and so is his frank record of Johnson's whole- 
some advice that he should ' clear his mind of 
cant.' 

Eecognizing all that is laughable and all that 
is indicative of weakness and vanity in such 
revelations as the foregoing, we may yet find 
much that is admirable in Boswell both as a 
man and as a writer, both as a faitliful friend 
and as a keen observer. However often he may 
have disregarded, merely from excess of animal 
spirits, the apostolic injunction to give no 
offense, he certainly showed an exemplary un- 
willingness to take offense. The harsh rebuffs 
he received from Johnson dt the very outset 
would have alienated a man possessed of that 
smallness of mind and that petty vanity so 
generally ascribed to our undaunted biographer. 
Drawn like iron to the magnet, he was stoutly 
determined not to mind a rude repulse of his 
first awkward overtures. It was at Davies's 
lx)okshop, a place thenceforth sanctified to Bos- 
well, that the two first met. Davies announced 
the great man's ' aweful approach,' and Boswell 
nerved himself for the ordeal. An unfortunate 
apology for his Scotch birth brought him snub 
number one. Then, when Johnson had com- 



plained to Davies of Garrick's refusing him an 
order to the theatre for old Miss Williams, Bos- 
well, watching for a chance to join in the con- 
Acrsation, exclaimed, ' Oh, sir, I cannot think 
Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you.' 
' Sir,' replied the other, with a stern look, ' I 
have known David Garrick longer than you 
have done, and I know no right you have to 
talk with me on the subject.' But in a day or 
two Boswell was on friendly terms with John- 
son. ' Poh, poh ! ' said the Doctor, with a com- 
placent smile, on being reminded of what had 
passed at the first meeting, ' never mind these 
things. Come to me as often as you can. I 
shall be glad to see you.' Balm to his wounded 
vanity it was not in Boswell's nature to refuse, 
although, after one especially outrageous affront, 
we find him protesting, in terms that won the 
masters admiration for their happy picturesque- 
ness, ' I don't care how often or how high John- 
son tosses me when only friends are present, 
for then I fall on soft ground; but I do not 
like falling on stones, which is the case when 
enemies are present.' The Doctor's commenda- 
tion of this image sufficed to atone for the rude- 
ness that had evoked it; and though he allowed 
himself to toss and gore his follower, he in- 
sisted that others should treat him well. It was 
Johnson's command that effected the Scotch- 
man's election to the Club, the dictator having 
made it known that until Boswell was admitted 
no other new member should be added. 

Leslie Stephen, in his admirable life of John- 
son, long ago pointed out some of the qualities 
tliat made Boswell •' a prince of interviewers ' 
before the interviewer as we know him was so 
much as dreamt of. A few of these personal 
traits it may be not unprofitable or uninterest- 
ing to recall. ' Perhaps,' says Stephen, ' the 
fundamental quality in Boswell's character was 
his intense capacity for enjoyment. He was, as 
Mr. Carlyle puts it, " gluttonously fond of what- 
ever would yield him a little solacement, were 
it only of a stomachic character." ' Like his 
idol, he frankly enjoyed the pleasures of the 
table. ' For my part,' was Johnson's declara- 
tion, ' I mind my belly very studiously and very 
carefully: for I look upon it that he who does 
not mind his belly will hardly mind anything 
else.' In somewhat the same vein Boswell ac- 
knowledges, ' I am myself a lover of wine, and 
therefore curious to hear whatever is remarkable 
concerning drinking' ; and he was always de- 
lighted when he could induce Johnson to discuss 
the matter ethically, statistically, and phil- 
osophically. Now it is this curiosity that seems 
to me the ' fundamental quality ' of Bogwell the 
biographer. It was a prime essential to the 
production of his marvellously ' speaking ' like- 
ness of the master. ' A generous and elevated

mind,' he quotes from the oracle, ' is distin- 
guished by nothing more certainly than an emi- 
nent degree of curiosity,' — a sentiment, it may 
l)e noted, that reappears in various form in the 
pages of the ' Kambler.' We are, then, to credit 
our much-ridiculed Boswell with a hvmger of 
the mind corresponding to his less praiseworthy 
animal appetite. It was an insatiable curiosity, 
often degenerating into a childish inquisitive- 
ness, and at times it provoked its chief object to 
an impatient outburst of protest. ' I will not 
he baited with what and why,'* exclaimed poor 
Johnson one day in desperation. ' Why is a 
c-ow's tail long? Why is a fox's tail bushy?' 
The following, also, must have been called forth 
after the master had been badgered beyond 
^endurance by his affectionate disciple, — ' ^ly 
regard for you is greater almost than I have 
words to express; but I do not choose to be 
always repeating it. Write it down in the first 
leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt it 
again.' At another time, when Boswell was 
cross-examining a third person about Johnson 
in his presence, — ' Sir,' he cried, in petulant 
remonstrance, *' you have but two subjects, your- 
self and me. I am sick of both.' But Boswell 
was irrepressible. Once when the two were 
•querying how best to induce a friend to leave 
London, Johnson said in revenge for some pre- 
vious offense, ' Xay, sir. we'll send you to him. 
If your presence doesn't drive a man out of his 
house, nothing Avill.' Yet the " unspeakable 
Scot ' stuck to his victim like a leech, and 
continued to pry into the minutest details of 
the great man's habits and peculiarities, even 
pushing his investigations as far as the subject 
of nightcaps and begging to know why his idol 
never wore one. It seems to have been a subject 
of absorbing interest to him. He also noted, 
with painstaking accuracy, that though John- 
son abstained from milk one fast-day, he did 
not reject it when put into his cup. The lex- 
icographers whistlings and puffings, and his 
way of saying ' too-too-too,' were all conscien- 
tiously recorded; and on one memorable occa- 
sion persistence surpassed itself and won a bet 
by hazarding the inquiry of Johnson what he 
did with certain scraped bits of orange-peel that 
lie had been observed to treasure up for purposes 
unknown. Curiosity in this instance was not 
gratified, but it certainly was c-arried to an 
extent that would have made its possessor inval- 
uable to the modern newspaper as an inter- 
viewer. 

To be sure, there is much that is unattractive 
in this eagerness for information, in season and 
out of season; but it was accompanied by such 
innocence of offense, such unfeigned good- 
humor, and, above all, has resulted so greatly 
to the advantage of Boswell's readers, that it 



would be ungrateful and unfair to censure him 
too severely. Burke paid his amiable qualities 
a curious compliment when he said of him that 
he had so much good-humor naturally it was 
scarcely a virtue. Most vain persons are vain of 
fancied endowments: Boswell takes innocent 
deUght in his real peculiarities, and thinks him- 
self so charming an object as to need no dis- 
guise. There is no false shame, no pompous 
regard for imagined dignity, but as cheerful a 
readiness to join in a laugh at himself as at 
his neighbor. Though the joke be at his own 
expense, it is none the less worth relating. ' I 
owned to Johnson,* he tells us, in a frank dis- 
cussion of his own foibles, ' that I was occa- 
sionally troubled with a fit of narrowness.' 
' Why, sir,' was the reply, ' so am I. But I do 
not tell it.' The excellence of the implied 
advice, we may gratefully note, was lost on our 
amusing Bozzy. Other pleasantries of this sort 
are easily turned up in Boswell's pages. Music, 
he once confided to Jolmson, affected him in- 
tensely, producing ' alternate sensations of 
pathetic dejection, so that I was ready to shed 
tears, and of daring resolution so that I was 
inclined to rush into the tliickest of the battle,' 
— a battle, of course, that was purely hvpothet- 
ical. ' Sir,' replied the other, 'I should never 
hear it, if it made me such a fool.' On another 
occasion Boswell expressed a wish to fly to the 
woods or retire into a desert, a disposition 
promptly checked by one of Johnson's custom- 
ary gibes at the considerable extent of easily 
accessible desert in Scotland. 

According to Johnson, Boswell was ' the best 
travelling companion in the world.' Imperturb- 
able good-humor and an unfailing ingenuity 
and resourcefulness in making talk — and con- 
versation was to Johnson the worthiest occupa- 
tion of a rational being — combined to make 
the lively Scotchman a \er\ acceptable comrade 
for the older maiL * If, sir, you were shut up 
in a castle and a new-born baby with you, what 
would you do?' was one of Boswell's silence- 
breakers — ludicrous and well-night witless, no 
doubt, but still welcome to one whose greatest 
horror was the undisturbed companionship of 
his own thoughts. Any remark, however trivial, 
any expedient however absurd, was justifiable 
if it could but serve to draw Johnson out; and 
it is with something of Shakespeare's art that 
our biographer has contrived to make his hero 
paint his own portrait. In his report of othere' 
conversation Boswell never misses the point of a 
story, but never thrusts it on our notice. The 
gist of one dialogue after another is deftly 
noted, and there are few irrelevances in his 
rapidly moving narrative. Just the stroke 
needed to indicate character or to make clear 
a possible obscurity is adroitly put in, and we

pass to something else. The story is so naturally 
told that we almost imagine it to ha.ve told itself, 
the writer serving as little more than a phono- 
graph to be spoken into by his various charac- 
ters. It is the art that conceals art. If any one 
questions this, let him, as Leslie Stephen sug- 
gests, try to put into writing, within the same 
compass, the pith of a brilliant conversation. 
Not only the humble offices of memory, but the 
higher qualities of artistic selection and repre- 
sentation went into those paragraphs of club 
talk and coffee-house discussion. Those who 
regard the chronicler of these conversations as 
nothing but a toady, an echo, a blind worshipper 
of his idol, should read again what he says of 
Johnson's anonymous pamphlet, written at the 
request of the government from which he re- 
ceived his pension, on * Taxation no Tyranny ; 
an Answer to the Eesolutions and Address of 
the American Congress.' * Of this perform- 
ance,' declares the biographer, 'I avoided to 
talk with him ; for I had now formed a clear and 
settled opinion, that the people of America were 
well warranted to resist a claim that their fel- 
low-subjects in the mother-country should have 
the entire command of their fortunes, by taxing 
them without their own consent. . . . Pos- 
itive assertion, sarcastical severity, and extrava- 
gant ridicule, which he himself reprobated as 
a test of truth, were united in this rhapsody.' 

Boswell was the first biographer in his kind, 
and he remains so far the greatest that, as 
Macaulay says, no one has yet successfully com- 
peted for second place. But for him, moreover, 
it is possible that we might never have had, in 
anything like their present form, such works 
as Lockhart's Scott, and Trevelyan's Macaulay, 
and Fronde's elaborate though not wholly judi- 
cious attempt to picture the prophet of Cheyne 
Eow. Not merely a remarkable degree of self- 
subordination, but also a stanch adherence to 
truth, regardless of remonstrances, went to the 
production of our great biography. ' I will not 
make my tiger a cat to please anybody,' declared 
Boswell when Hannah More entreated him to 
soften some of the burly Doctor's asperities. 
Toning down, he instinctively felt, would 
depress the lights as well as the shadows. We 
should not be so deeply affected by Johnson's 
kinder qualities did we not see them often 
masked by an irritability that meant only a 
manly nature's unwillingness to reveal the 
underlying tenderness of heart. And all this 
we owe to one who, in writing his life of the 
master, counted it time well spent * to run half 
over London in order to fix a date correctly ' ; 
one who, in Carlyle's words,* out of the fifteen 
millions that then lived ahd had bed and board 
in the British islands . . . has provided us 
with a greater pleasure than any other individ- 



ual at whose cost we now enjoy ourselves, per- 
haps has done us a greater service than can be 
specially attributed to more than two or three.'

COMMUNICA TION. 



MONTAIGNE AND ITALIAN MUSIC. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In her article on Montaigne in the issue of 
The Dial for February 1, Dr. Mary Augusta 
Scott has accepted in one instance (and possibly 
in two) a mistake in Mr. Waters 's translation of 
Montaigne's Journal of travel, which is perhaps 
worth correcting. She quotes Montaigne (using 
the words of Mr. Waters 's translation) as saying 
that near Florence 'the peasants have lutes in 
their hands, and the pastoral songs of Ariosto on 
their lips,' What Montaigne wrote (he was then 
writing in Italian) was that he was struck with 
three things : one being ' di veder questi eontadini 
il liuto in mano, e fin alle pastorelle [the shep- 
herdesses] 1 'Ariosto in bocco.' There are no 
'pastoral songs' ascribed to Ariosto. 

The other error is more difficult to clear away. 
Montaigne says: 'Les instrumans sont en toutes 
les boutiques jusques aus ravaudurs des carre- 
fours des rues.' Mr. Waters translates these 
words as follows: * There is a musical instrument 
in every shop, even in the stocking-darner's at 
the comer of the street.' It is hardly conceiv- 
able that Montaigne wrote of 'shops' of the stock- 
ing-darners, and described such shops as being 
at 'the corners of streets.' 'Eavaudeur' has 
other meanings beside that of mender of clothes 
or darner of stockings. Nicot, in his Dictionary, 
after defining it by ' Sarcinator, ' adds: 'Et par 
metaphore Ravaudeur est dit celuy qui ne s§ait 
ce qu' il die, le propos duquel est tout rappetasse, 
et celuy qui ne fait rien a droict ni a propos.' 
And Cotgrave essentially translates this by, 'A 
Botcher; also an idle or ignorant speaker, one 
that either confounds or imderstands not what 
he says ; or one that neither does nor says ought 
rightly.' 

In this, or in a kindred sense, Montaigne seems 
to use the word in his essay 'De la Phisionomie': 
' Sans peine et sans suffisance, ayant mille volumes 
de livres autour de moy . . . j ' emprunteray 
presentement s'il me plaist, d'une douzaine de 
tels ravaudeurs, gens que je ne f euillette guiere, 
dequoy enrichir le traicte de la Phisionomie.' 

It is in this sense, which continued in use in 
the next century, and is defined by Littre as 
'Celui qui ne dit que des balivemes,' that the 
word in Montaigne's journal is perhaps to be 
interpreted, and the passage— which follows a 
notice of 'improvisatori'— may be translated: 
'Instruments are in all the shops and even [in 
the hands of] the idle talkers at the street cor- 
ners.' 

But if the simple significance of darners be pre- 
ferred, we may be reminded of the 'old and plain* 
song of 'the spinsters and the knitters in the 
sun.' Grace Norton.

Memorials of ax Exolish Patnter.* 



A life of Sir Edward Buxne-Jones, written 
by his widow, bids fair, on theoretical grounds, 
to be a performance of doubtful value. The 
Pre-Eaphaelite painters have already been thor- 
oughly exploited by skilful hands. The career 
of either EosseHi or Morris furnishes a far more 
dramatic point of deparinire than the less eccen- 
tric and less varied one of Bume-Jones. There 
is, too, the danger of sentimentality and of 
rhapsodical criticism, as well as of more dis- 
agreeable disclosures about Ex>ssetti, and more 
irritation over KusMn's peculiar methods of 
making and unmaking friendships. On the 
other hand, we may expect from Lady Bume- 
Jones intimate knowledge and sympathetic 
understanding, which, if good judgment and 
skilful manipulation are added, should produce 
a delightful memorial of a fascinating coterie. 

It is only fair to Lady Bume-Jones to say 
at once that she has avoided every pitfall that 
lay along her path, and has made the most of 
every pleasure that the excursion afforded. She 
has transcribed all the joy of living and work- 
ing, the buoyant enthusiasm, and the vivid, 
many-sided interest in men and things, which 
were characteristic of her husband and his 
friends. She has been reserved where reserve 
was desirable; and her pari;iality for her sub- 
ject has never led her into bathos. As for the 
little touch of affectation in the account of her 
first acquaintance with her husband and the 
early days of their marriage, it only adds a bit 
of quaintness to the narrative. She thoroughly 
appreciates the vivacity and color of her hus- 
band's conversation and letters, and uses his 
notes and correspondence, and those of his old 
acquaintances, to brighten and vivify her own 
by no means impleasing style. So one's doubts 
are speedily dissipated, and supplanted by thor- 
ough enjoyment of a remarkable piece of biog- 
raphy. 

The memorial is in two copiously-illustrated 
volumes, of which the first contains at once the 
best and the worst of Lady Bume-Jones's work. 
The account of Bume-Jones's family, and of his 
childhood and school-life, is too long. It has 
the interest that belongs to any close study of 
alert, open-minded boyhood; further than that 
it is commonplace, and a large part of the space 
accorded to it could have been spent to better 
advantage on later and more unique experiences. 
But once the Oxford days are reached, with 
their splendid enthusiasms, their almost defiant 

• Memobials of ES)wabd BtrRNK-JojrES. By G. B.-J. In 
two TolTunes. Illustrated. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



challenge to life to show forth the best that 
is in it, their fine achievements of friendship 
with men and books, — once Lady Bume-Jones 
begins upon Oxford, the reader's interest is 
quickened. And it never wanes until the 
second volume is finished; although the later 
years, crowded with vast undertakings and pan- 
oramic with famous personages, lack the special 
charm of the earlier days. Then Ruskin was a 
god to be worshipped from afar, Bossetti a 
giant, Morris a hero, the world a place to sketch 
in, and a sketch the absorbing work of a life- 
time. 

At Oxford Bume-Jones saw much of a tal- 
ented set of Pembroke college men from his 
home town of Birmingham, but his sun rose 
and set by William Morris. Both men came to 
the university with the definite purpose of enter- 
ing the church. Both were bitterly disap- 
pointed in the religious life of their collie and 
the state of the episcopacy. Both loved art and 
poetry, and together they discovered the * Morte 
d' Arthur,' fell under the spell of Poe's mys- 
ticism, dabbled in mesmerism and church 
polemics, and read Tennyson, Thackeray, 
Eangsley, Chaucer, and above all Euskin. 

One morning Morris brought Ruskin's newly- 
published * Edinburgh Lectures' to Bume- 
Jones's rooms , and. then, to quote from the lat- 
ter, 

'Everything was put aside until he read it all 
through to me. And there we first saw about the 
Pre-E^phaeUtes, and there I first saw the name of 
Rossetti. So for many a day after that we talked 
of little else but paintings which we had never 
seen, and saddened the Uves of our Pembroke 
friends. * 

Shortly afterwards, some of the work of MiUais 
was shown at Oxford, *and then,' Bume- 
Jones says, * we knew.' During his first years 
at the university he had cherished the notion of 
forming a clerical Brotherhood, composed of 
himself, Morris, and the Pembroke set, which 
should live and work in the heart of the London 
slums. But when he decided that painting 
was his destined career, and Morris made choice 
of architecture, the idea of the Brotherhood 
was gradually abandoned; or rather it was 
modified, taking shape in such projects as the 
joint editorship of the * Oxford and Cambridge 
Magazine,' and later in the partnership decorat- 
ing of the walls of the Oxford Union, or in the 
firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. 
And its mission was not to save men's souls, but 
to mend their minds, by giving them new ideals 
of truth and beauty. 

In 1855 both Morris and Bume-Jones left 
Oxford, the latter without waiting to get his 
degree. The next year (1856) Lady Bume- 
Jones styles 'Annus Mirabilis.' Early in its 
course came the beginning of acquaintance with

Buskin. Tliis is Burne-Jones's account, con- 
tained in a note to a friend : 

'I'm not Ted any longer, I'm not E. C. B. Jones 
now — I've dropped my personality — I'm a corre- 
spondent with BUSKIN, and my future title is 
"the man who wrote to Buskin and got an answer 
by return." I can better draw my feelings than 
describe them, and better symbolize them than 
either.' 

And below is a drawing of himself prostrate 
before an aureoled figure intended for Ruskin. 

A little later came the meeting with Rossetti. 
Wishing to know how the man looked who had 
drawn the ' Maids of Elfenmere ' and written 
' The Blessed Damozel,' Burne-Jones went to a 
lecture at the Working Men's College, and by 
the good-fellowship prevailing there secured not 
only the sight he coveted, but an introduction 
also, and following that an invitation to Eos- 
setti's studio by Blackfriars Bridge. Writing 
to a friend shortly after this visit, Rossetti 
s]>eaks of ' a certain youthful Jones, one of the 
nicest young fellows in — Dreamland.' His 
liking rapidly ripened into intimacy. Morris 
and Burne-Jones drew and painted and watched 
the master paint in Rossetti's studio, and went 
with him to see the Brownings, and the Prin- 
seps of Little Holland House, with whom Watts 
was then living, and frequently to the theatre. 
But if the play did not suit Rossetti, they were 
dragged summarily away, ' which through wor- 
ship of him we always assented to obediently, 
though much wanting to know how the story 
ended. And sometimes we roamed the streets 
and sometimes went back to Blackfriars to 
Gabriel's rooms and sat till three or four in the 
morning, reading and talking.' 

Rossetti was very encouraging about Burne- 
Jones's work. After having seen his drawings, 
he refused to allow the younger artist to spend 
his time in learning the mechanical art of wood- 
engraving; and he insisted that Morris also 
should abandon architecture and take up paint- 
ing, as the best medium for expressing the 
poetry he had in him. Poetry, Rossetti declared, 
had almost run its course in England, but paint- 
ing was still an unknown art there, and the 
next Keats ought to be a painter. 

So Morris painted, but his versatile genius 
also turned to wood-caiTing, and it was at this 
time too that he l^egan designing furniture. 
When the two friends moved into their famous 
apartment at Red Lion Square, the chairs and 
tables were made after Morris's designs, and 
painted by him and Burne-Jones and Rossetti 
with knights and ladies from jVIalory — ' perfect 
marvels,' Burne-Jones calls them. Some four 
years later the Morrises moved into Red House, 
and it was from the necessity of furnishing and 
decorating this house, and the impossibility of 
buying any furniture or hangings that Morris 
could endviTC to live with, that the idea of a 



manufactory of all things needed in household 
decoration took its rise. 

By the end of 1856 Ruskin had become a 
l>atron and a dear friend. ' Today we are to go- 
and see Ruskin,' Burne-Jones writes to Miss 
Sampson, his father's housekeeper. And after 
their return he goes on: 

'Just come back from being with our hero for 
four hours — so happy we've been: he is so kind to- 
ns, calls us his dear boys and makes us feel like 
such old friends. Tonight he comes down to our 
rooms to carry off my drawing and show it to lots 
of people; tomorrow night he comes again, and 
every Thursday night the same — isn 't that like 
a dream? Think of knowing Buskin like an equal 
and being called his dear boys. Oh! he is so good 
and kind — better than his books, which are the 
best books in the world.' 

The painting of the walls of the Oxford 
Union was Rossetti's project. In it he enlisted 
Burne-Jones, Morris, Arthur Hughes, Alex- 
ander Munro, the sculptor, Valentine Prinsep, 
who was studying with Watts, and half a dozen 
others, each of whom promptly abandoned what- 
ever he was doing and went down to Oxford, 
because their adored Rossetti wished it. Mr.. 
Prinsep gives a very vivid account of dining 
Avith Rossetti on the evening of his arrival. 

'There I found Bossetti in a plum-coloured frock- 
coat, and a short, square man with spectacles and 
a vast mop of dark hair. I was cordially received. 
"Top," cried Bossetti, "let me introduce Val 
Prinsep." (Topsy was the name by which 
Morris — ' ' that unnaturally and unnecessarily curly 
being" — wasi known among his intimates.) 

' ' ' Glad, I 'm sure, ' ' answered the man in spec- 
tacles, nodding his head, and then he resumed his 
reading of a large quarto. This was William 
Morris. Soon after, the door opened, and before 
it was half opened in glided Burne-Jones. "Ned," 
said Bossetti, who had been absently humming to 
himself, "I think you know Prinsep." The shy 
figure darted forv^ard, the shy face lit up, and I 
was received with the kindly effusion which was- 
natural to him. 

'When dinner was over, Bossetti, humming to 
himself, as was his wont, rose from the table and 
proceeded to curl himself up on the sofa. "Top,"" 
he said, "read us one of your grinds." "No,. 
Gabriel," answered Morris, "you have heard them 
all." "Never mind," said Bossetti, "here's 
Prinsep, who has never heard them, and besides,, 
they are devilish good." "Very well, old chap," 
growled Morris, and having got his book he began 
to read in a sing-song chant some of the poems 
afterwards published in his first volume. . . . To- 
this day, forty years after, I can still recall the 
scene: Bossetti on the sofa, with large, melancholy 
eyes fixed on Morris, the poet at the table reading 
and ever fidgetting with his watch-chain, and 
Burne-Jones working at a pen-and-ink drawing. 
' "Gold on her head and gold on her feet. 
And gold where the hems of her kirtle meet. 
And a golden girdle round my sweet, 
All I qu'elle est belle La Marguerite," 
still seems to haunt me. ... I confess I 
returned to the Mitre with my brain in a whirl. ' 

In later years a great wall of melancholy 
surrounded Rossetti and shut him away from 
liis friends, but they never lost their admifa-

tion of the man in his prime and felt nothing 
but pity for the wreck he had made of his life. 
As time went on Eugkin also dropped away; 
but ^lorris nerer failed, and other friends 
came in to fill the vacant places, — the Glad- 
stones, Du Maurier. Lady Leighton, Charles 
Eliot Xorton and his family, and many more, 
besides the host of young artists to whom Bm-ne- 
Jones never refused his advice and sympathy. 
And the pictures went on in never-ending suc- 
cession. So, while the later years have less 
brilliancy and enthusiasm than the earlier ones, 
they are happy, ambitious, full of work and 
new hopes and new interests. As Burne-Jones's 
personality strengthened and he became more 
and more the centre of his own world, instead 
of Boesetti's satellite or Morris's friend, the 
stream of the biography narrows and deepens, 
to show more of his character and of his per- 
sonal aims and methods of work. 

Undoubtedly the most valuable thing about 
Lady Bume-Jones's work is the pleasant light 
it casts across the whole Pre-Eaphaelite move- 
ment. Memoirs of Rossetti have tended to 
emphasize the sordid element in the lives of the 
circle, and tiie unbalanced element in their 
work. Biographies of Morris naturally em- 
phasize their socialistic leanings, and the Arts 
and Crafts side of the movement. Bume-Jones's 
work was confined to the narrower field of 
painting, and he was even more closely asso- 
ciated with Eossetti than was Morris. Like 
Rossetti and most of the others of the circle, 
he was a poor man, harassed b}- the necessity 
for petty economies, as well as by continual ill- 
health, — privations of which Morris knew 
nothing, — yet there is nothing sordid in Lady 
Bume-Jones's outlook upon life. She tells a 
cheerful story, and makes her readers realize 
that it was the best, and not the worst, of Ros- 
setti, — liis greatness, not his eccentricity, — 
that his friends cared for; that there was noth- 
ing necessarily morbid or decadent in their 
love of beauty; and that if they did not attain 
to all they hoped for, they were the better for 
the aspiration. It is well for this view to be 
emphasized, particularly when it is tlone as 
convincingly as Lady Bume-Jones has man- 
aged to do it. There is no doubt about her 
sincerity; every page of her writing rings true. 

Lady Burne-Jones wisely refrains from any 
attempt at criticizing her husband's work. In 
consonance with this decision, it is only suit- 
able that the illustrations contained in the two 
volumes should consist of portraits of the 
family and their friends, and reproductions 
of sketches or early drawings. Thus the illus- 
trations partake of the intimate character of 
the memoir, and add decidedly to its interest.

TuE Philosophy of Americanism.* 

Professor Muensterberg remarks that his book 
portraying * The Anuericans ' might aj^ropri- 
ately have been given the title that heads the 
present review. Such philosophy is presented 
imder four heads, to which are referred the 
inspiring motives that direct the interests, 
ideals, occupations, institutions, and diaracter 
of the Americans,, individually and collectively. 
TTiese are the * Spirit of Self-directi(Mi,' the 
* Spirit of Self-Realization or Initiative,' the 
' Spirit of Self-perfection,' and the ' Spirit of 
Self- Assertion.' With symmetrical consistency 
these fourfold inspirations serve as the introduc- 
torv chapters to the fourfold phases of Ameri- 
can life, — Political, Economic, Intellectual, 
Social. The justification of this philosophical 
schedule, and the necessary harmonizing i^reof 
with the course of events and with the present 
status of affairs in our puzzling democracy, give 
form and substance to the six hundred pages of 
the volume. Equally influential as a motive to 
the authors initiative is his frequently uttered 
conviction that of all peoples, the Americans 
and the Germans need to understand one 
another, should contribute cooperatively and 
sympathetically to the growth of culture, and 
should mutually receive and offer benefit on the 
basis of their distinctive civilizations. His 
labors are thus sustained by the conviction that 
they are to serve as a step toward this interna- 
tional consummation. Practically, the most effi- 
cient motive in shaping the volume has been 
the desire to furnish the German reader with a 
suitable account of the real nature of the Amer- 
ican people, of their institutions, their prob- 
lems, their mode of life, their interests, their 
culture. The work was written by the author in 
German for the Germans ; just as his book enti- 
tled * American Traits ' was written in English 
for home consumption. The two treatises, we 
are informed, bear the complementary relation 
of a pair of stereoscopic pictures : the difference 
of their points of view i^ulting in an added 
realism of their combined effect. Apparently 
with some reluctance, the English translation 
has been authorized, and with some omissions — 
notably, and regrettably, the chapter on Ger- 
man-Americans, upon which topic the author's 
views would have received special consideration 
on the part of American readers — substan- 
tially reproduces the two volumes of the orig- 
inal. It is likewise to be regretted that the 
translator has felt his obligations to the original 
so literally as to force upon the English con- 
struction t}-pes of expression, orders of phrase-

ology, and modes of approach to statements, 
which the American's keen sense of form — a 
trait noted by the German- American autlior — 
finds peciLliarly irritating. 

Although the author sets forth that his 
concern is with ' the lasting forces and tenden- 
cies of American life/ and not with ' the prob- 
lems of the day/ the distribution of the pre- 
sentations themselves hardly supports this 
emphasis. Viewed objectively, the account of 
the political organization is most amply pre- 
sented. The pervasive power of political par- 
ties, the functions of the executive, the mode of 
procedure and temper of Congress, the status 
of the judiciary, the complex relations of State 
and City to the Federal Government, form the 
natural components of American politics. With 
them are considered our internal and external 
political problems, — the dominance of the 
former and (until recently) the slight hold of 
the latter upon the political interest being 
sharply contrasted, — and also the special social 
and ethnological problems of our variously 
assorted population. A particularly incisive 
account of the indirect but effective way in 
which public opinion enters to make or mar the 
political game deserves honorable mention. The 
comprehensive and intensive absorption of the 
American people in industry and commerce 
must in every account constitute a vast 
and impressive aggregate. Statistics that im- 
press and bewilder by their magnitude testify 
the more strikingly to latter-day strenuosity, 
by aid of the historical comparisons of the 
curve of progression through which the 
present status has been reached. As t3rpical 
and important problems of our economic 
life the silver question, which has already 
acquired something of a bygone flavor, and 
those ominous realities, the tariff, the trusts, and 
the labor unions, are presented primarily in 
terms suited to Teutonic assimilation. With 
these obligations realized. Professor Muenster- 
berg proceeds with a notably freer handling and 
more congenial manner, to set forth our status 
in regard to education, high and low, public and 
private, good and bad. A rather bare chapter 
on the achievements of science in America gives 
way to a far more sympathetic account of our 
literary tendencies, successes, and failures. The 
manner in which Americans express themselves 
in art, and live and move in religious tenets and 
activities, occupy chapters proportionate to these 
factors in American culture. Our social life is 
the most briefly disposed of; the introductory 
chapter requiring supplementing only by that 
most characteristic feature of Americanism, writ 
large in other than the society column, but here 
ungallantly entitled ' the ' self-assertion of 
women '; and by a portrayal of such aristocratic 



tendencies as have survived the onslaught of 
our iconoclastic democracy. 

By plan, selection of topics, and perspective 
of presentation, the work seems measurably 
suited to its objective purpose, that of carrying 
enlightenment to the many highways and by- 
ways of Germany, where conceptions of what 
really goes on in our midst, and notably of the 
motives and temper of the participants in the 
drama, are such as to cry out lustily for some 
vigorous corrective. On this score English read- 
ers are prepared to make proper allowances, 
bearing in mind that much of what is familiar 
and obvious is yet not superfluous when ad- 
dressed to a foreign public. They cannot avoid, 
however, calling to mind the far more vigorous, 
discerning, and, to the Americans themselves, 
instructive account which Mr. Brv'ce has given, 
though in larger proportions, of the institutiom-: 
of the American commonwealth. The compari- 
son is provoked by the equally ambitious char- 
acter of the present volume, and emphasizes how 
essentially the value of such an undertaking is 
dependent upon the temper of the artist, as well 
as upon his particular metier and technique. 
Viewed on its informational side, and yet 
regarding the critical discernment and vigor 
without wtdch such presentation is stale and 
flat though possibly profitable, Mr. Bryce's work 
assumes a value to all readers, and ranks as an 
independent contribution; while to Professor 
Muensterberg's work must be assigned the more 
humble virtue of a fair suitability to German 
consumption. 

In this aspect, however, although the author's 
talents and position make his conclusions worthy 
of distinct consideration, the volume does not 
demand, and is not likely to receive, a widely 
extended notice. The distinctive note thereof 
and the contention which it is certain to arouse 
have as yet been indicated in part only. The 
issue arises in regard to the pertinence of the 
philosophical key that is presented as unlocking 
the secret power-house of American thought and 
activity, and with regard to the judicial deci- 
sions which permeate through and through 
every topic considered in the several chapters. 
So much is this the case that the sensitive Amer- 
ican reader leaves the volume with the feeling 
of having been unexpectedly liberated from the 
prisoner's stand; while the publishers (doubtless 
with no adequate authority) see fit to herald 
the volume as ' a vivisection of the American 
people so incisive, true, and interesting that 
every American will enjoy reading it.' As an 
offset, the author raises the query whether ' such 
a eulogy of Americanism before the Americans ' 
will not unduly stimulate the spirit of self- 
satisfaction which may likewise be an American 
trait. Surely, in the present connection, eulogy

and vivisection are equally out of place. The 
•question is not whether a critical estimate of 
American ways and contributions is a legitimate 
or desirable matter, but wholly whether the par- 
ticular form of holding things in the balance, 
which dominates this volume, can or does result 
in any useful or helpful service. That it inter- 
feres essentially with the successful ministra- 
tion to the several functions which the book was 
planned to serve, seems clear enough. While 
the positing of a philosophic Americanism and 
the persistent application of the odium of com- 
parison are in themselves questionable proceed- 
ings, equally in regard to the purposes of the 
author and to the convictions of the reader, the 
main issue is as to the intrinsic value of such 
philosophy and of such judicial findings as are 
here handed down. The philosophy helps the 
reader little, if at all, and certainly weakens, 
when it seriously affects, the presentation. For- 
tunately it frequently does little more than fur- 
nish the author with a series of categories by 
means of which dominant American traits — 
the significance of which at times lies in other 
•directions — are referred back to one or other 
of the fourfold motives. If one drops the phi- 
losophy, and plainly sets forth the variety of 
characteristic ways, pleasant and unpleasant, in 
which the fundamental American independence 
of thought and action disports itself, the same 
•end is accomplished and nothing lost. That cer- 
tain traits and tendencies are expressible in 
terms of these categories, the author has shown ; 
but that these have in themselves any explana- 
tory or illuminating power does certainly not 
Appear. Yet this objection could be ignored, 
did not Professor Muensterberg insist that in 
the potency of these four arch-characters of 
homo Americanus lies all hope of identifying 
and comprehending this interesting new-world 
specimen. 

If the philosophy may be dismissed as of 
slight eflBciency, yet not detracting from the 
merits of the work except through its needless 
obtrusiveness, the same leniency of judgment 
cannot be extended to the array of positive pro- 
nouncements in which the work abounds. That 
certain, indeed that many, of the positions 
taken are in their salient features sound, and 
that real distinctions are shrewdly observed, the 
acumen of the author guarantees. The idealism 
of American life is particularly well noticed; 
though even here love of contrast carries the 
point into quite inappropriate fields. One feels, 
too, a greater confidence in those judgments 
that repeat the verdict of the authors previous 
volume — ' American Traits ' — and bring with 
them no necessity of speaking pro to one public 
and con to another. One is grateful when Pro- 
fessor Muensterberg points out the haphazard 



make-up and wastefulness of our direction of 
the educational machinerj-, and has in pleasant 
memory bis memorable article in ' The Atlantic 
Monthly ' on ' School Reform.' When he points 
out the obvious feebleness of the American 
drama, and is compelled to admit that it reflects 
little of that striving for self-perfection which 
pervades Americanism, we again respond with 
a chastened ' Amen.' When he indicates the 
dangers of a too rapidly established dominance 
of feminine ways of thinking, he finds a public 
that appreciates without distorting his caution, 
even as it questions the need of it. When he 
indicates — as so many have done before him. — 
as one of the serious shortcomings of our 
aggressive democracy, the tendency to overlook 
reaUy great men and to magnify complacent 
bourgeois leaders, we realize that a vital weak- 
ness has been laid bare. This type of criticism 
so far as it is sympathetically and fairly pre- 
sented — and on this score little fault is to be 
found — is sure to meet with a fair reception, 
even when the manner of indicating these weak- 
nesses is not particularly acceptable to the 
American type of receptivity. These are in the 
main fairly definite questions in regard to the 
nature of the cultural tendencies which we col- 
lectively exhibit, and which the observant 
stranger in our midst is likely to note. 

The type of judgment, the fault of omission 
and commission, which is distinctively more 
certain to arouse protest and antagonism is not 
60 easy to indicate. The change b«5omes appar- 
ent when the discussion shifts from the indica- 
tions of objective failings to subjective motives, 
from what we do and how we do it to that inner 
perspective of considerations that eventually 
determines action. It is in these attempts to 
read back of the tendencies and behind the rec- 
ords what is bred in the bone and graven in the 
heart of the American that the author's foreign 
spectacles — even though refitted in America 
and accustomed to the vagaries of our atmos- 
phere — render inefficient his psychological 
astuteness. It is on this score that the candid 
critic, however favorably disposed towards Pro- 
fessor Muensterberg's able and good-tempered 
effort, cannot avoid the responsibility of indi- 
cating that, from the American point of view, 
the distinctive features of the volume carry but 
little of conviction or enlightenment. This ver- 
dict conveys with it no intimation of deficiency 
on the part of the author, except in r^ard to 
temperamental and hereditary traits. A less able 
man might well have written a book of richer 
insight: for it is notably true that this art of 
national delineation demands qualities of tem- 
perament even more than of training. The con- 
trast of attitude may be illustrated by referring 
once more to the philosophic scheme in whici 



150

the present exposition finds its guidance. In 
the Teutonic mind this fonrfold partitioning 
of Anicj'ican traits and its apparent fitness to 
the situation arouses distinct gratification. In 
the American as in the English mind, it merely 
arouses suspicion; and the American writer, 
finding himself inclined to fall in love with these 
categorical muses, becomes scrupulously cau- 
tious to prevent any unseemly subservience to 
so symmetrically perfect an ideal. The German 
writer points the finger of emphasis to it in his 
l>refaee; the American writer would use the 
same space to explain or apologize for his hesi- 
tant willingness to use the scheme at all. 

It is but fair that further instances should bo 
indicated of the failure of the author's tempera- 
mentally guided insight to lead him aright 
through the mazes of th^ American character. 
Any transition from an objective description of 
institutions to a subjective delineation of char- 
acter is particularly difiicult in America on 
account of the many varieties of typical Ameri- 
cans. Professor Muensterberg tells us that he 
is presenting * a study of the Americans as the 
best of them are, and as the others should wish 
to ],)e.' As a matter of fact he is frequently 
describing types that are not suggested by this 
characterization. And yet he misses the inner 
significance of this very variety itself, — a vari- 
ety that will not lend itself to the type of form- 
ula here regarded as dominant. It is quite the 
same tendency that leads him to posit Washing- 
ton as the political capital, New York as the 
commercial, and Boston as the intellectual. 
Apart from the inevitable concentration of 
national politics at the capital, these differenti- 
ations are misleading. If America were Euro- 
peanised, we would of necessity have commer- 
cial and intellectual capitals. The significant 
fact about us is that these things are not cen- 
tralised; and the insistence of the intellectual 
superiority of Boston, like the recurrent glorifi- 
cation of the members of the Harvard faculty, 
cannot but arouse a smile where it does not call 
up a less charitable emotion. For the type of 
national portraiture that is here attempted, the 
American simply will not — though possibly he 
should — obey the rules of the game. The result 
is that the diversity of American character is 
slighted, and that the type held up as dominant 
to the inquisitive German is distinctively mis- 
leading. It carries with it little of the quality 
of a portrait from the living modelj but rather 
the conventionalised aeademic grouping of fea- 
tures that has its source in a prejudiced mental 
photograph. 

Specifically does it fail by lack of compre- 
hension of the \inderlying sterling English 
group of ideas and modes of reaction which 
still constitute the core of Americanism. The 



point would bear elaboration. In spite of 
the many variations, the intrinsically English 
temper of our civilization is most effective. Had 
this trait been appreciated, there would have^ 
appeared as ample reason to provide for a chap- 
ter on self-restraint as for any of the four other 
types of self-conditioned motives. Americ-an 
self-restraint is not English self-restraint; but 
it serves as a common differentium when the 
American is to be contrasted with the German 
or the Frenchman. The same insistence on this 
factor of good form and of propriety in the 
conduct of affairs, the same prominence of the 
ideals of a ' gentleman,' pervade American and 
English life; and — as a single instance — make 
impossible those frequent relations of personal 
hostility that mar the high regard that Amer- 
icans cherish for the German academician. 
These traits are deep-seated ; they are difficult to 
bring to the surface. But it is their omission 
that imparts the imreality to the portrait. And, 
once more, there is a failure to understand that 
the American is facile in importing and graft- 
ing foreign products to native growths, but has 
no intention of absorbing these into his mode of 
life. What we borro^v is so vastly different in 
its effect upon the national temperament from 
what we inherit and what we develop. Ameri- 
can ladies import their finery from Paris, but 
without thereby becoming in the least Gallic in 
appearance or in outlook on things in general. 
The leaders of the intellectual life and in the 
world of commerce make use of ideas and 
processes that are made in Germany, but they 
show nothing (Teutonic in their intellectual 
make-up. The expert may recognize the for- 
eign traits in the transplanted fruit, but the 
soil by which the tree grows is thoroughly Amer- 
ican. 

It is for like reasons that Professor Muen- 
sterberg's practical mission seems equally hope- 
less of result. The German and the American 
are likely to continue to feel such measure of 
attraction and repulsion for one another as they 
now cherish; and no indication, however justi- 
fied and adequate, of their community of inter- 
ests and ideals, will alter the effectiveness of 
those temperamental qualities that — one may 
acknowledge with regret — do form a consid- 
erable obstacle between the mutual understand- 
ing of German and American. In this estrange- 
ment and national incompatability, the Ameri- 
can finds himself not alone; but often discov- 
ers with surprise how the same feeling, though 
differently motivated, is shared by so many 
other of the dominant nations of Europe. 

While acknowledging gratefully and admir- 
ingly the objective service which this volume is 
to perform in the German community, the self- 
assertive American cannot refrain from express-

MTL.ITARY Rule axd Xatioxal, 
Expansion.* 



From the organization of the Northwest Ter- 
ritory in the days of the Confederation, to the 
events of the past few years resulting from the 
Spanish war, the United States has pursued a 
fairly consistent, even though not arbi- 
trarily designed, course of territorial ex- 
pansion. With an energetic and growing 
population, and with vast stretches of produc- 
tive lands ever just across the borders, this 
aspect of our national history has been clearly 
inevitable. It may well be questioned whether we 
have need to acquire landed possessions across 
the seas: but that we have, or soon shall have, 
a real use for all the territories contiguous with 
our own which we have annexed during the 
past hundred years, will hardly be disputed by 
anyone, even though methods employed, as in 
the case of the Mexican cessions, may not be 
regarded as always distinctly creditable. 

It is a curious fact that in the mass of lit- 
erature, more or less worthy, that has grown 
up about the subject of American expansion, 
one very important phase of the process has 
until recently been almost totally n^lected. 
The political, the constitutional, the diplomatic, 
and the commercial aspects of territorial acqui- 
sition have been pretty well worked out, but 
as a rule the strictly administrative policies and 
principles involved have been dealt with by 
writers only incidentally, or at least with refer- 
ence merely to single cases of annexation. There 
has been no well-grounded attempt at sys- 
tematic treatment of the subject as a whole. 
The need for such a piece of work is now in part 
supplied by Dr. David Y. Thomas's ' History 
of ^Military Government in newly acquired Ter- 
ritory of the United States,' a doctoral dis- 
sertation of rather unusual merit recently 
submitted to the Faculty of Political Science 
of Columbia University. 

The proposed scope of Dr. Thomas's mono- 
graph should be made clear before judgment 
is passed. By purchase, conquest, occupation,

acquired in any of these ways has been com- 
pelled to pass through a transition stage inter- 
vening between the occupation of it by the 
officials and troops of the United States and^ 
the definite organization of it into ' territories' 
in the technical sense. During this transition 
stage, when the authority of previous owners 
and claimants had been cut off and that of the 
United States could be asserted only through 
temporary agents, such annexed domains have 
been held under what is commonly known as 
Military Government. What Dr. Thomas set 
out to do, and what he may be said to have 
done with a good degree of success, was to 
start with Louisiana in 1803 and make a sur- 
vey of all our annexations of territory with 
respect to the theory and practice of military 
government as applied during this preparator}' 
stage by the executive power of the United 
States. The result, therefore, is not a history 
of American expansion in general, or of Ameri- 
can military government in general, but a 
pointed presentation of the part which military 
government has played in the intervals, usually 
brief, between the stationing of commandants 
by the President in annexed territories and the 
placing of these territories on a civil basis by 
action of Congress. The task of preparing such 
a study, as the author conceived it. involved not 
only a consideration of the legal status of new 
territory and the legal basis for military gov- 
ernment and its various administrative activ- 
ities, but also a description of the actual 
management of new acquisitions from the time 
of occupation ixntil the organization of terri- 
torial or state governments. 

The fullest and most valuable part of the 
book is that dealing with the four great acqui- 
sitions of Louisiana, Florida, Xew Mexico, and 
California. The preliminary governments of a 
military character established in these regions 
are discussed with a very satisfactory apprecia- 
tion of existing conditions and with a clear 
conception of the larger political and constitu- 
tional bearings of the s}-etem. The treatment 
of military- rule in other annexed territories, — 
Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, Porio Rico, 
Samoa, and the Panama Canal zone, — is much 
briefer, and on the whole less satisfactory. The 
author tells us that regarding these he deems 
it ' unnecessary, not to say improper, to go into 
details upon the same scale,' and that * for the 
most part they must be left to the reader's 
memory of partisan accounts, or to the 
researches of a later historian when the air 
shall have cleared and the evidence shall be 
complete and accessible." Xotwithstanding the

spirit of scholarly caution here displayed, it 
would seem that more than two pages might 
profitably have been given to Alaska, and more 
than one to Hawaii. It is fair to say, however, 
that there is probably nowhere in print a bet- 
ter summary of military government in the 
Philippines and Porto Rico than that given 
us by Dr. Thomas. 

The work throughout is based on the best 
of documentary materials, and these are 
referred to in the foot-notes with a fair degree 
of frequency. One cannot repress the feeling, 
however, that so elaborate a treatise on a subject 
of such general interest ought never to be pub- 
lished unaccompanied by a full and systematic 
bibliography. The index to the work, too, is 
rather inadequate. Feedeeic Austin Ogg. 



The Poetry of Mr. SwrN^suRNE.* 

Singer last born of all the starry race 
Whose names make bright the heaven of Eng- 
lish song, 
With words that should not do thee wholly- 
wrong 

We fain would praise and thank thee for the grace 

Bestowed of all thy gifts, were not the space 
Of our slight verse too narrow for the throng 
Of grateful memories and emotions strong 

That cluster round thy nam© to find a place. 

But we will bring thee tribute of our love, 
Because thy song has ever set above 

All things most cherished since the world began 
The priceless thing which gives to life its worth, 
Most sacred of the sacred things of earth, — 

The freedom of the body and soul of man. 

It is a great satisfaction to have at last the 
complete poetical works of Mr. Swinburne in 
a uniform library edition. The foremost of liv- 
ing poets has long been held from his own in 
the estimate of the larger reading public by the 
fact that it has hitherto been almost impossible 
to view his work as a whole. The numerous 
and multiform books which have contained it 
have heen difficult to obtain and almost prohibi- 
tive in price. The author says : ' It is nothing 
to me that what I write should find immediate 
or general acceptance,' and the sincerity of the 
statement is beyond question. But it is much 
to all lovers of poetry that the only surviving 
exemplar of the great Victorian age of song 
should be easily accessible to them, and such 
access is now measurably facilitated by the six 
volumes into which the contents of the earlier 
sixteen have been brought together. Even this 
collection does not include the dramatic works 
(with the exception of ' Atalanta ' and ' Erech- 

♦ Thb Poems of Algernox Charles Swinburne. In 
six volumes. With portrait. New York : Harper & Broth- 
•ers. 



theus'), but those works are to follow in a 
series of five more volumes. 

The sixteen volumes now reprinted include 
the two Greek dramas, the three series of 
' Poems and Ballads,^ the two volumes of Arthu- 
rian narratives, ' Songs before Sunrise,' ' Songs 
of Two Nations,' * Songs of the Springtides,' 
' Studies in Song,' ' A Midsummer Holiday,' 
' A Century of Eoundels,' ' Astrophel,' ' A 
Channel Passage,' and the ' Heptalogia.' The 
last-named collection of parodies is now first 
acknowledged by Mr. Swinburne, although its 
authorship has been an open secret from the 
time of its publication a quarter of a century 
ago. All these volumes are reprinted with prac- 
tically no changes. Mr. Swinburne is evidently 
of the opinion that the product of the creative 
hour had better be left to speak for itself, that 
any subsequent tinkering is more likely to mar 
than to mend the original. For an artist of 
Mr. Swinburne's type, whose verses are forged 
at white heat, although with no scamping of the 
workmanship, this appears to be a just instinct, 
although it is possible that artists of other types 
may be well-advised in making amendments at 
the dictate of the reflective years that super- 
vene. The question is one that admits of no 
general rule of practice, although a recollection 
of the ^ improvements ' that some great poets 
have made upon their originals incline us to 
believe that the labor limce so frequently lauded 
is more likely than not to be a work of futility. 

Mr. Swinburne, at least, has had no doubts 
as far as his own work is concerned, and beyond 
a few trifling corrections of the most obvious 
sort, and a few lines added to the ' Heptalogia,' 
has altered nothing. Allied to the instinct 
which has held him to this course is that which 
has impelled him to reprint everything con- 
tained in the volumes as first published. He 
says of the * Notes' that accompanied and de- 
fended the famous first volume of ' Poems and 
Ballads ' that he has ' nothing to retract from 
them,' and this statement at least implies that 
he has nothing to retract from the poems them- 
selves, or from any of the poems that have fol- 
lowed them during nearly forty years. Even 
the poems inspired by political passions that 
now seem remote to us are all scrupulously 
reproduced, from the curses heaped upon the 
third Napoleon and the ninth Pius in the sixties 
to the denunciation in the eighties of ' the hoary 
henchman of the gang ' who, in the opinion of 
the poet, sought the undoing of England for the 
furtherance of his political ambitions. Even if 
the years have lessened the vehemence of some 
of these old animosities, they were genuine 
enough at the time of their expression, and the 
poet probably feels that to delete them from his 
work would denote a lack of intellectual integ-

rity. Litera scripta manet, and these things are 
a part of the historical record from which the 
final judgment pronomiced upon nineteenth- 
century men and affairs will be made up. 

In our last issue, something was said of the 
deeply interesting retrospect which prefaces the 
first volume of this collected edition. The pur- 
pose of the present review is mainly to discuss 
the contents of * A Channel Passage and Other 
Poems/ published in England as a separate new 
volume, but in this country (thus far at least) 
only as the final section of the sixth volume of 
the complete poems. A few of Mr. Swinburne's 
later poems have seemed to us, as they have 
appeared from time to time in the reviews, to 
be unworthy of his genius. Although all these 
pieces are now reprinted, they are in the com- 
pany of so many others to which the most cap- 
tious critic would find it diflBcult to take excep- 
tion, that the impression made by the volume as 
a whole is that it adds materially to the poefs 
fame. It maintains as high an average level as 
is reached by most of the preceding volumes, 
and it fairly outweighs one or two of them. 
Its publication is then, absolutely considered, an 
event of the first importance, or at least of 
greater importance than could possibly attad; 
to the publication of a new collection by any 
other known English singer. 

The titular poem is accompanied by a date 
(1855) which would indicate that it was half a 
century old. But this date must refer to the 
experience described rather than to the com- 
position of the verses, for ' A Channel Passage ' 
is clearly written in the poet's matured style, 
and it is inconceivable that it should really have 
been produced by a boy of eighteen — even by 
as marvellous a boy as he who wrote ' Hesperia.' 
A few lines will make this fact sufficiently evi- 
dent. 

' Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky 

laughed out into light 
From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with 

flames that were flowerlike and white. 
The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning 

that laugh as they fade 
From the cloud's black base to the black waves' brim 

rejoiced in the light they made. 
Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in 

lustrous tune. 
Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the 

steadfast smile of the moon. 
The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier 

than dreams may behold, and deep 
As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine 

on the soul through sleep.- 

' A Channel Passage ' is but one of the nature- 
poems which are scattered with lavish hand 
. throughout this volume. Others of great beautv 
are 'The Lake of Gaube,' 'Hawthorn Tide/ 
and ' The High Oaks.' 

The remEiining contents of the collection 
(with one notable exception, to be discussed 
hereafter) fall chiefly within the two categories 



of poems inspired by political passion, and 
poems of a personal or memorial nature. In 
the first of these categories comes * A Word for 
the Navy ' (which is an old poem not hitherto 
reprinted), * The Commonweal,' 'The Question,' 
and ' Apostasy ' (which date from the home 
rule controversy of the eighties), the poems on 
recent happenings in Eussia, Greece, and Crete, 
and a group of pieces occasioned by the war in 
South Africa. The poems of this group are 
greatly inferior to Mr. Swinburne's earlier work 
of similar character, and need not long detain 
us. The ode to Russia achieved a certain noto- 
riety because of the line 

* Night hath none but one red star — Tyrannicide,' 

which cost the author many a hard journalistic 
rap. The verses ' For Greece and Crete ' yield 
these noble lines, which may, however, be over- 
matched a dozen times by passages in ' Athens/ 

* Greece, where only men whose manhood was as godhead 

ever trod. 
Bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her 

feet are shod : 
Freedom, armed of Greece, was always very man and 

very God. 

' Now the winds of old that filled her sails with triomph, 

when the fieet 
Boond for death from Asia fled before them stricken, 

wake to greet 
Ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred 

shores of Crete.' 

The memorial poems now collected include 
pieces inscribed to Shakespeare, Cromwell, Nel- 
son, Bums, Eabelais, Voltaire, and Dumas, be- 
sides personal tributes to Christina Eossetti, 
Mrs. Lynn Linton, Lord Leighton, G. F. Watts, 
President Camot, and Aurelio Saffi. There is 
also a tender dedication (in the familiar stanza 
which the poet has made his own for such pur- 
poses) to the memory of WilHam Morris and 
Edward Bume-Jones. These poems have 'the 
redeeming quality of entire and absolute sin- 
cerity ' which the author claims for them, be- 
sides many other admirable qualities concerning 
which his own voice is silent, but which the 
critic is bound also to claim for them. The 
most important of these poems is the ode to 
Bums, from which we take the closing stanzas. 

' But never, since bright earth was bom 
In rapture of the enkindling mom. 
Might godlike wrath and sunlike scorn 

That was and is 
And shall be while false weeds are worn 

Find word like his. 

' Above the rude and radiant earth 
That heaves and glows from firth to firth 
In vale and mountain, bright in dearth 

And warm in wealth. 
Which gave his fiery glory birth 

By chance and stealth, 

' Above the storms of praise and blame 
That blow with mist his lustrous name. 
His thimderous laughter went and came. 

And lives and flies ; 
The roar that follows on the flame 

When lightning dies.

' Earth, and the snow-dimmed heights of air. 

And water winding soft and fair 

Through still sweet places, bright and hare. 

By bent and byre, 
Taught him what hearts within them were : 

But his was Are.' 

A word of praise should also be given to the 
Eabelais roundel, the Carnot sonnet, and the 
verses in memory of Mrs, Linton, in the simple 
form of the verses written tx) the glory of Lan- 
dor forty years ago. 

Among the miscellaneous features of this vol- 
ume may be noted an ode to ' Music,' some ex- 
•quisite new songs of childhood, a translation of 
■the Delphic Hymn to Apollo, some lines ' At a 
Dog's Grave,' and a group of * Prologues ' for 
certain of the more famous Elizabethan plays. 
These poems supplement the earlier series of 
sonnets on the old English dramatists, of which 
the author says : ' I can hardly remember any 
task that I ever took more delight in discharg- 
ing than I felt in the inadequate and partial 
payment of a lifelong debt to the marvellous 
and matchless succession of poets who made the 
glory of our country incomparable for ever by 
the work they did between the joyful date of 
the rout of the Armada and the woeful date of 
the outbreak of the civil war.' Tlie ' Prologues ' 
may be taken as a further instalment toward 
the payment of the debt thus acknowledged. 
They and the volume are closed by ' The After- 
glow of Shakespeare,' — 

' Alone of all whose doom is death and birth, 
Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth.' 

We have left for the close of this review our 
consideration of the poem which is the crown- 
ing glory of the present volume, * The Altar 
of Righteousness ' is so great a poem that any 
words of praise would do it but scant justice. 
It may be briefly described as a companion to 
the ' Hymn of Man,' and as the final summing- 
up of the poet's philosophy, the last word in his 
confession of religious faith. The contrast be- 
tween the shifting forms of superstition and the 
veiled central object of all true religious emo- 
tion is embodied in the following passage : 

' Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that 
man may behold of it wrought : 

Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar, where wor- 
ship is none but of thought. 

No prayers may go up to it, climbing as incense of glad- 
ness or sorrow may climb : 

No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards 
it, and hears not of time. 

As the winds of the wild bUnd ages alternate in passion 
of light and of cloud. 

So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with 
darkness and light for a shroud. 

And the winds and the clouds and the stars fall silent, 
and fade out of hearing or sight. 

And the shrine stands fast and is changed not, whose 
likeness was changed as a cloud in the night.' 

The body of this poem offers a sort of historical 
survey of the religious instinct groping its way 
upward to the light. To the advent of Chris- 
tianity this lovely tribute is paid: 



' Then, soft as the dews of night, 
As the stars of the sundown bright. 

As the heart of the sea's hymn deep. 

And sweet as the balm of sleep, 
Arose on the world a light 

Too pure for the skies to keep.' 

A beautiful tribute to St. Theresa occupies a 
conspicuous place in the poem, and fairly 
matches the glorification of St. Catherine in 
the ' Siena ' of ' Songs before Sunrise,' Then 
comes the tale of the gradual undoing of the 
ecclesiastical perversions of Christianity, with 
mention of Bruno and Ral)elais, and much 
praise of Shakespeare. 

' In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power 

and the pride. 
The. song of the soul and her story, bore witness that 

fear had lied. 
All hope, all wonder, all trust, all doubt that knows not 

of fear^ 
The love of the body, the lust of the spirit to see and to 

hear. 
All womanhood, fairer than love could conceive or desire 

or adore. 
All manhood, radiant above all heights that it held of 

yore. 
Lived by the life of his breath, with the speech, of his 

soul's will spake. 
And the light lit darkness to death whence never the 

dead shall wake.' 

The final section of the poem ends as follows: 

' All the names wherein the incarnate Lord lived his day 

and died 
Tads from suns to stars, from stars into darkness undes- 

cried. 
Christ the man lives yet, remembered of man as dreams 

that leave 
Light on eyes that wake and know not if memory bid 

them grieve. 
Fire sublime as lightning shines, and exalts in thunder 

yet. 
Where the battle wields the name and the sword of 

Mahomet. 
Far above all wars and gospels, all ebb and flow of time. 
Lives the soul that speaks in silence, and makes mute 

earth sublime, 
still for her, though years and ages be blinded and 

bedinned. 
Mazed with lightnings, crazed with thunders, life rides 

and guides the wind. 
Death may live or death may die, and the truth be light 

or night. 
Not for gain of heaven may man put away the rule of 

right.' 

With this strain of majestic music in our ears, 
we close the volume, our gratitude to the poet 
for his many past gifts strengthened and re- 
newed, our thankfulness deepened for his con- 
tinued presence in the world of living men.

STRUGGLES Uf THE WORLD OF SlTFFERIXG.* 

In the volume sent forth from the busy 
oflBce of the secretan- of the Xew York Charity 
Organization Society, those who are interested 
in benevolent work ■will find a most instructive 
and stimulating discussion of ' The Principles 
of Eelief.' The standpoint is that of one who 
is most familiar with the heroic efforts of 
private charity to mitigate the sufferings of 
dependent families. Ite author, Mr. Edward 
T. Devine, is optimistic, and indicates the con- 
ditions under which relief may help without 
j>auperizing. But he comes, to the practical 
conclusion that all direct mea^-ures will fail 
unless larger social policies are fostered. The 
lxx>k will help us to give a quantitative value 
to our vague notions about the standard of 
living and the minimum wage; and no writer 
has applied this definite standard to the 
methods of poor relief more thoroughly. Espe- 
cially valuable to a student is the analysis of 
t}-pical relief problems, which enables one to 
arrive at principles of relief much as a study 
of court decisions takes one to the heart of 
legal principles. A brief historieal survey of 
English and American poor laws and methods 
furnishes a background for the generalizations, 
and the deductions from the experiments made 
in connection with such disasters as the Chi- 
c-ago Fire, and industrial distress in periods 
of crisis, are of permanent value. The field of 
vision is chiefly that of a charity organiza- 
tionist, and some important topics, — as state 
and town relief, child-saving work, care of 
defectives, and some others, — are lightly 
touched. The work will be recognized as one 
of the chief contributions on this vital subject. 

Dr. Washington Gladden has written a grace- 
ful sketch of the historical development of 
industrial organisations of society and the ten- 
dency to improvement in the lot of wage- 
earners, in the volume entitled ' Organized 
Labor and Capital.' Mr. Talcott Williams 
analyzes with wealth of legal learning the origin 
of corporations and the ethical and legal prin- 
ciples which regulate appropriate treatment of 
them. Dr. George Hodges defines and illus-

trates the rights and wrongs of the trade union. 
Bev. Francis G. Peabody reminds us that the 
great public is a party in controversy whose 
interests are paramount and which ultimately 
holds final power of decision and control. Al- 
together, the discussion, while rather an inter- 
pretation of our situation than the report of 
primary investigation, is a sane and sensible 
statement of many of the most essential con- 
clusions of impartial and competent students. 

Along the path of thought made familiar 
by the Socialists, the author of ' Mass and 
Class, a Survey of Social Divisions,' conducts 
us to the inevitable conclusion, the cooperative 
commonwealth. And if the terrible facts cited 
from reliable sources stood alone; if they rep- 
resented the main tendency of capitalistic 
man-dgement ; if it should prove true that the 
traders cannot be honest and cannot even con- 
struct a moral code; if their domination makes 
falsehood and oppression necessary, — then the 
people would greet almost any change, save 
revolution. Our President has a mind to tame 
the traders, and make an experiment with con- 
stitutional and legal regulation. If his method 
fail, ^Ir. Ghent's thorough scheme would have 
several millions of attentive readers. Mean- 
time, the nation puts the prophet on the upper 
^elf, and awaits with some patience the trial 
of less heroic remedies. 

Mr. Kobert Hunter, in his work on ' Poverty,' 
disclaims any pretensions to original investiga- 
tions and novel contributions to knowledge. 
His materials might be found in the documents 
and treatises which are cited in his bibliography. 
Yet it is fair to say that he has coined the 
crude metal into current form and stamped it 
with his own personal quality. He has, as 
agent of charity organizations and settlements, 
b^n driven by what he witnessed and expe- 
rienced to the discovery that individual effort 
and philanthropic agencies are utterly inade- 
quate to prevent the increase of misery in the 
absence of a national policy. His descriptions 
of extreme distress have the vivid color and 
sharp outline which comes only wiili direct 
observation. His statistics of pauperism are 
confessedly incomplete, and his estimates may 
be exaggerated ; but he has clearly demonstrated 
the necessity for more thorough investigations 
by the government than we have yet had. It 
seems incredible that any human being can 
read this volume without fixing his purpose to 
work for a more rational method of dealing 
with the immigration of defectives, the insur- 
ance of unskilled workingmen, the municipal 
provision for playgrounds, and the other sane 
and practical measures which promise at least 
some degree of relief. The argument for legal 
prohibition of child-labor in urban industries 
is sound and vibrant with patriotic and humane

eympathy. Those who simply neglect to read 
such discussions become participants in the 
national injustice which threatens our civiliza- 
tion with a new invasion, a veritable deluge of 
barbarism. It will little avail to promote 
science, art, and literature, unless adequate 
measures are taken to select the breeding stock 
for the nation. At present the tendency is to 
select the unfit; and the author shows that 
*race suicide' is an inevitable consequence of 
unregulated immigration. His argument on 
this point deserves special attention. 

The director of the People's Institute in New 
York, which conducts educational work chiefly 
in the Cooper Union, describes his experiments 
and sets down certain generalizations in his 
book entitled ' Working with the People.' 
Workingmen are deeply interested in those 
social problems that are concerned with the 
distribution of wealth ; but the ' Classes ' up- 
town will not spend time listening to lectures 
on such subjects, for they are the happy pos- 
sessors. Workingmen like discussions rather 
than sermons, and their interests are wide 
enough to include music, history, literature, 
drama, and some religion. Sectarianism in a 
mixed audience is not tolerated, but a man who 
can show how the immanent forces of the uni- 
verse are related to right and happiness on this 
earth may gain a hearing. Socialism is wel- 
come in such gatherings, because it gives the 
* Masses ' some chance to control the social 
machinery which masters their lives. Municipal 
ownership of public utilities is favored by these 
audiences. 

Miss Frances A. Kellor, in her book entitled 
' Out of Work,' has brought together a body of 
first-hand information about the devices and 
mysterious ways of employment-agencies and 
intelligence-offices, which throws much light on 
the perplexities of housekeepers. Ultimately 
this investigation will doubtless aid in the 
amelioration of conditions. The method of 
securing the facts was one which a detective will 
admire and which the man of science will 
commend, for it was marked by shrewdness and 
exactness. The campaign in which this plucky 
student is a pioneer will carry terror to the 
unscrupulous and will help the honest and use- 
ful men and women whose function it is to 
market the commodity of surplus and misplaced 
labor. 

In the volume entitled ' Seven Years' Hard/ 
a young clergyman of the Church of England 
tells in fragments of anecdote, with a hint of 
social philosophy and a little of clerical bias, 
some of his experiences in a poverty-cursed 
region of East London. It is not a story and it 
is not a system of sociology, but a series of snap 
^hots of the life of people ground to earth by 



employers, debased by drink and ignorance, and 
indifferent to art, science, history, morals, and 
religion. The author is not without his theories 
of reform, — he would have all land owned by 
government; all churches united and free from 
dissension and soup-house bribery; while culti- 
vated people from the West End should reside 
in the East End and leaven the obdurate lump. 
In his view, ordinary philanthropy is mockery,, 
a homeopathic pill diluted in a sea of misery; 
for the ' gift without the giver is bare.'

I believe I will enjoy.' But his manifest sin- 
cerity in all his literary judgments, and his 
abounding enthusiasm for a wide range of good 
books make his chapters delightful reading. 
Qualities and preferences, it is true, he very hon- 
estly reveals, that one might wish to be other- 
wise. For instance, 'that roaring despot, Dr. 
Johnson,' he likes not at all. But as he repeat- 
edly sings the praises of 'The Pilgrim's Prog- 
ress' and 'Robinson Crusoe,' and as the way to 
his heart is through his favorite books, perhaps 
he will let us call his attention to two familiar 
anecdotes that ought to soften him toward the 
worthy Doctor. One day, as Croker tells us, 
Johnson took Bishop Percy's little girl on his 
knee and asked her what she thought of 'The 
Pilgrim's Progress.' The child replied that she 
had not read it. 'No!' returned the Doctor; 
'then I would not give one farthing for you.' 
Thereupon he set her down and took no further 
notice of her. Mrs. Piozzi records in her 
'Anecdotes' a saying of Johnson's that should 
delight our book-lover. 'Was there ever yet 
anything written by mere man,' he asks, 'that 
was wished longer by its readers, excepting 
"Don Quixote," "Robinson Crusoe," and "The 
Pilgrim's Progress"?' 'E. G. 0.' is an old 
bachelor, dried and seasoned, a lover of his pipe 
and his fire-side, and perhaps in some danger of 
forgetting that life is more than literature, and 
that man does not live by books alone. Yet as 
we are judging him from data furnished by

himself for oux entertainment, we must be 
lenient. We believe him to have a warm 
human heart, and to be at bottom a right good 
fellow, whose real name we should like to learn, 
and whose acquaintance we should like to make. 



The city of Ferrara, at one time 
of Savonarola. ^^^ ^^ the great Centres of Italian 

eultui-e, at present holds a p)osition 
of relative unimportance, and so little is heard 
of it that but few have a definite idea even 
of its location. But the city that was the 
birthplace of Savonarola, the home of Ariosto, 
and the refuge of Tasso, will never be wholly 
forgotten. Interest in this old Lombard town 
will doubtless be stimulated by the recently pub- 
lished *Storj- of FeiTara,' written by Miss Ella 
Noyes and included in the 'Mediaeval Towns' 
series (Dent-Macmillan). The author devotes 
about two-thirds of her book to the history of 
the city, and recounts its troubles and triumphs 
from its earliest emergence in the seventh cen- 
tury to its great eclipse at the close of the six- 
teenth. The whole account centres about the 
ruling family of Este, which came into imdis- 
puted control of the city in 1208. To this 
remarkable line of rulers, typical despots of the 
wonderful age of the Renaissance, Ferrara owes 
her greatness and her fame. The story of the 
A-arious reigns is, as a rule, told in a sjTnpathetic 
manner; still, the author is not blind to the 
strange weakness and grossness that seem to 
have fonned a pai't of the character and culture 
of the period and tries to present a true picture 
of Estensi despotism. Her work seems to have 
this defect, however, — that too much is said of 
the court and too little of the masses that strove 
to supply the splendor that is described so well. 
In the last third of the book we are given a 
descriptive view of the city, its palaces, pictures, 
streets, churches, and abbeys. In forming an 
idea of what remains of FeiTara's greatness, the 
reader is aided by a niunber of interesting illus- 
trations drawn by Miss Dora Xoyes. The work 
is written in easy, dignified English, the narra- 
tive is interesting, and the historian displays 
good taste and judgment both in her choice and 
her rejection of materials. The book is well 
supplied with poetical quotations from the great 
Italian masters; but as these are frequently not 
translated, their presence often detracts from 
the general interest of the work. 

nthy essays To say that the substance of Mr. 
on literary H. W. Bo\niton's volume entitled 
subjects. i. Journalism and Literature' 

(Houghton) has appeared, for the most part, in 
*The Atlantic Monthly' is enough to indicate 
that it is made up of serious and suggestive 
work, though the nan-ow limits within whidi 
the separate essays are confined suggest rather 
the 'by-product' of literary effort than its 
main purpose. There is a touch here and there 
in Mr. Boynton's work that reminds one of 
Miss Repplier, and one might veiy successfully 
pick up his book for 'dozy hour' reading, fol- 
lowing the by-paths of thought which his sen- 
tences open up or letting them drop to suit the 



fancy. It is by no means eveiy writer who will 
yield results worth while either to desultorj' or 
to careful reading, but we think Mr. Boj-nton 
has attained to that good fortune. The essay 
on 'Journalism and Literature,' from which the 
volume takes its title, attempts no rigid dis- 
tinction between the two, but admits a great 
deal of inter-penetration along the lower mar- 
grin of the latter and the upper margin of the 
former. The ruthless demands of daily jour- 
nalism could not keep a Godkin confined whoUy 
within its narrow limits, and on the other hand 
the many who reach the higher walks of litera- 
ture through the avenue of journalism are not 
always successful in leaving the dust of the road 
wholly behind them. The two functions in their 
normal development, however, are quite distinct. 
Literatui'e. properly so called, requires the cre- 
ative faculty and presents a personal interpreta- 
tion of life; the business of journalism is to 
record events and to comment upon them from a 
more or less rigidly pre-determined point of 
view. The originality that is the prime condi- 
tion of success in pure literature is not needed 
in jouiTiaJism, and may even be a stumbling 
block. On the whole, we like the paper on 
'American Humor' better than anything else in 
Mr. BoATitonls volume. The author's power 
of packing a great deal of truth in a few words 
shows to good effect in his adjudication of cer- 
tain claims to a seat on the bench of humor. 
For instance: 'The true hmnorist cannot help 
conceraing himself with some sort of interpreta- 
tion of life: Mr. Bangs can.' 



Ui Ohio 
retfiment in 
the Civil War. 



The supplying of materials for the 
future great history of the Civil 
War goes on unceasingly; and one 
of the most jwpular forms taken is that of regi- 
mental records. These, like the family genealo- 
gies and town annals of New England, whUe not 
exactly history, are indispensable to the histo- 
rian ; and the story of a regiment 's war achieve- 
ments has at least symmetrical form,— a true be- 
ginning, middle, and end. Those who i)eruse 
it with breathless interest are the survivors and 
their families; the 'general reader' will go 
through it as he does through the flag-rooms and 
relic-rooms in the State-house, — with his hat off 
and his attention only occasionally roused by the 
mention of a famous name. . One of the best 
recent books in this kind is entitled 'Trials and 
Triumphs ; or, the Record of the Fifty-fifth Ohio 
Volunteer Infantry' (McClui^) ; and its prin- 
cipal author is Captain Hartwell Osbom, who 
served honorably with the regiment throughout 
the war. The Fifty-fifth Ohio was recruited in 
Huron County (of which Norwalk is the countj^- 
seat), after the reverses at Bull Run had stirred 
the Noi-th to greater efforts; it had its full share 
of the campaigns in Virginia, Tennessee, and 
Georgia, and of the terrible work at CTianeellors- 
ville and Gettysburg. This is related with clear- 
ness and graphic power by Captain Osbom; and, 
besides the narrative, the book is xmusually com- 
plete in regimental statistics, sketches of officers 
and citizens, and personal notes and recollections 
of soldiers. Photographs, both 'wartime' and

modern, have been reproduced in profusion, to 
recall the features of many a comrade; and the 
Avork is in eveiy way a real contribution to the 
literature of the gi-eat struggle. 

A scientific Professor Holtzmann's 'Life of 

biography Jesus/ published in Germany in 

of Jesus. 1901, now appears in an English 

translation (Macmillan). The book represents an 
effort to present the trustworthy picture of the 
life of Jesus that it is felt historical science 
is under obligation to provide, and the point of 
view is therefore strictly that of scientific crit- 
icism. The work exhibits thorough acquaintance 
with the sources, Jewish as Avell as Christian, 
and Avith the literature of the subject. More- 
over, the writer possesses to a good degree the 
sATupathy and insight necessary for such a task. 
As sources for the life of Jesus, he recognizes 
the Synoptic Gospels, or rather their sources, 
the Gospel of Mark and MatthcAv's collection 
of sayings which was used by all three Synop- 
tics. 'The fii'st and best source is ahvays the 
Collection of Discourses; the next best is the 
Gospel of Mark' (p. 32). The 'Gospel accord- 
ing to the Hebrews' is reckoned 'one of the 
primary soureesi we possess for the life a£ 
Jesus' (p. 52). While Professor Briggs is found- 
ing his chronology of Jesus 's ministry upon 
John's references to various feasts. Professor 
Holtzmann is dismissing the fourth Gospel as a 
mere Avork of art, and describing the sorry tat- 
ters that we possess of the lost 'Gospel accord- 
ing to the Hebrews' as 'certainly equal as a 
source to the Johannine Gospel in value' (p. 
46). Surely the truth lies between these posi- 
tions. Holtzmann's Greek feeling is clearly at 
fault when he appeals to the saying of Salome 
in the lost 'Gospel according to the Egyptians,' 
'Then have I done well in that I have not borne 
children,' for the words may as Avell be read 
'Then had I done well not to bear children"?' 
The contradiction betAveen this fragment and 
the Synoptic tradition as to Salome (Mt. 27:56, 
Mk. 15:40) is factitious. 



Memoirs of To those interested in that some- 
a French what pei-plexing conflict knoAvn as 

dragoon officer. ^^^ -^^^ ^f ^^^ Spanish Succes- 
sion, Mr. Walter C. Horsley's translation of a 
now little-known French Avork, Avhich he styles 
in English 'The Chronicles of an Old Cam- 
paigner, 1692-1717' (Button), will be welcome. 
The author of these 'Memoires,' he tells us, is 
M. de la Colonic, and nowhere in the book have 
we come upon his full name, Avhich from other 
sources Ave learn to be Jean-Martin de la Colonic. 
He Avas a native of Bordeaux, and early entered 
the service of Maximilian Edward, Elector of 
BaA-aria, and ally of France in the war that 
resulted in seating Philip of Anjou on the Span- 
ish throne. La Colonie afterward became field- 
marshal and distinguished himself under Prince 
Eugene at the siege of Belgrade. Returning to 
Bordeaux and to private life after the stiiTing 
events of this chronicle, he devoted himself to 
historical studies and published, besides the 
book under discussion, & 'Cui'ious History of 



the Town and ProAunc« of Bordeaux.' His liter- 
aiy output seems to have met Avith consider- 
able favor, as several editions of the 'Memoires* 
appeared in his lifetime. Mr. Horsley names 
Brussels, 1737, as the place and date of the first 
publication of this Avork; but Ave find record of 
an earlier edition, apparently the first one^ 
issued at Fi'ankfort in 1730. The book is pre- 
eminently for military men, being devoted to 
the details of battles and sieges, of marches and 
counter-marches. Other readers Avill find it 
tiresomely prolix. Both translator and printer 
appear to have done their Avork well. Portraits, 
plans of battles, and a copious index are duly 
provided. 

The problems lu the preface to Mr. Frank L. 
of Modern McYev's 'Modern Industrialism* 

Industrialism. (Appfeton), the author confesses 
that it were indeed a bold task to consider such 
an inclusive subject Avithin a single volume. He 
confines himself, therefore, to shoAving, first, the 
essential elements of the industrial histoiy in the 
United States, Great Britain, and Gennany; sec- 
ond, to pointing out some of their complications; 
and, third, to discussing certain consequent prob- 
lems of administration. The reader is initiated 
into the discussion thi-ough a surA^ey of the sub- 
ject, a general comparison of the methods of pro- 
duction at various times and in different places. 
He is then shoAvn pai'ticularly the industrial 
changes which have taken place within the three 
countries Avhich the author purposes to consider. 
Thence he is led through a more detailed and 
extremely interestuig account of present indus- 
trial conditions, and the institutions Avhieh are 
the outcome of them. Logically, questions arise 
as to the correction of certain evils, and solutions 
are clearly and concisely offered from the point 
of view of State interference, regulation, and 
government OAvnership. Mr. McVey's conclusion 
as to present conditions, especialh" in the United 
States, are somewhat ominous; and yet his out- 
look for the future can be considered in no way 
pessimistic. His book, on account of its fairness 
and balance, deserves to be Avidelj'^ read; and it 
can hardly fail to create in its readers a livelier 
interest in industrial conditions. 



Mr. Charles A. Eastman's 'Red 
TaT/Sr Hunters and the Animal People' 

(Harper) is likely at ni-st to be a 
little disappointing, it is so plain, so lacking in 
art or artifice. After Mr. Long and Mr. Thomp- 
son-Seton, it is like bread-and-butter after des- 
sert. But it nearly, if not quite, justifies the 
simile, for if the reader sustains his interest 
long enough his taste will approve the rather 
homely fare. Mr. Eastman, as is well knoAvn, 
is an educated Sioux Lidian, but he does not 
pose, even upon that vantage-ground. That it is 
a A'antage-gTound, lioweA-er, is sufficiently clear. 
Familiarity Avith the wild tribes has doubtless 
bred in him some coolness with regard to crack- 
ing bones and floAving blood; but it has not bred 
cruelty. The Indian— at least the good Indian— 
belieA^es that he should not kill unless he needs 
food. He thinks that 'all the tribes of eartli

have some common feeling,' and he is not 
ashamed to go to the beaver and the wild-cat, 
the bear and the deer, to consider their waj's 
and be wise. He shares his catch with the wolf 
that has pointed out the prey, and spares the 
mountain ewe and her lamb. He remains friends 
with the eagle that has saved his life, and for 
the sake of that friendship he never kills one 
of the eagle-folk. He smokes the pip>e of peace 
over his fallen enemy the grizzly, and leaves 
handfuls of cut tobacco beside the two elk who 
have fought to the finish, 'returning to camp 
empty-handed out of respect for the brave 
dead.' 'And who is the grandfather of these 
sUent people?' he asks. 'Is it not the Great 
Mystery? For they know the laws of their life 
so well! They must have for their Maker our 
Maker. Then they are our brothers!' This 
spirit of imderstanding and of awe lifts Mr. 
Eastman's stories, plain as they are, far above 
the ordinary in interest and significance. 



An English ' The Adventures of King James IT. 
monarch's of England' (Longmans) is the 

adventures. ^^^ ^^ ^ ^q^j, ^y an unnamed 

author, but with an introduction by the Right 
Rev. F. A. Gasquet, D.D. The work is slightly 
tinged with a Catholic bias, but is on the whole 
very fair in its statement of events and impartial, 
if sometimes original, in its judgment of men. 
The life of James II., heretofore little known 
save for the three years he was King, furnishes 
many striking situations, and of these the author 
has made the most, placing special emphasis on 
James's adventures in the armies of Turenne and 
Conde, his ser\-ices as head of the English navy, 
and his genuine religious conviction, centred at 
first in alliance to the established church, later 
to Catholicism. The customary judgment of his- 
tory that James 11. had much less real ability 
than his brother as a ruler, is here denied, and 
in fact Charles 11. is throughout regarded as a 
trifler, swept unresistingly along by the current. 
The book is in no sense a history, but is rather a 
characterization, the reader's knowledge of lead- 
ing political events being taken for granted. This 
is in some slight degree confusing at times, but 
the fault is more than compensated for by a 
wealth of intimate anecdote not permissible in a 
more formal history. The value of the book is 
much increased by the inclusion of several beau- 
tiful portraits. 

Facts for the In his book entitled 'How to Col- 
coiiectorof lect Old Furniture' (Macmillan) 

old furniture. -^ Frederick Litchfield has sup- 
plemented his more exhaustive and theoretical 
history of antique furniture with a practical 
appendix treating only the comparatively mod- 
em kinds of old furniture, such as the collector 
of ordinary means might wish to identify or to 
purchase. This limitation excludes everything 
earlier than the sixteenth century, as well as 
the magnificent pieces of later i)eriods in which 
only the millionaire collector or the museum 
would have an acquisitive interest, and centres 
attention on the domestic furniture of the last 
three hundred years,— Renaissance, French, Ital- 



ian, Dutch, and particularly English. Mr. Litch- 
field offers numerous hints, cautions, and su^es- 
ticms, calculated to put the reader on his guard 
and assist him in making intelligent choice in 
purchasing; and a glossary of technical terms 
used in connection with furniture will enable him 
to consult catalogues and written descriptions of 
old furniture intelligently. The numerous cuts 
are with a few exceptions from photographs of 
examples to be found in the Victoria and Albert 
Museimi. 



XOTES. 



A selection of representative editorials from the 
files of the New York ' Sun ' during the past twenty 
years will be published shortly by Mr. Robert Grier 
Cooke in a volume entitled 'Casual Essays of The 
Sun.' 

'Cambridge Sketches' is the title of a forth- 
coming volume by Mr. Frank Preston Steams, made 
up of essays dealing with life and character in the 
famous New England university town. The J. B. 
Lippincott Co. will publish the book this spring. 

The English 'Who's Who' for 1905, published by 
the Messrs. Macmillan, is the fifty-seventh annual 
issue of that important book of reference. The 
volume is now eighteen hundred pages thick, plus 
another hundred pages of prefatory and advertising 
matter. 

A new coUeetion of Mr. Owen Seaman's inimi- 
table parodies wiU be published shortly by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. 'A Harvest of Chaff' is the title 
of the book, and among Mr. Seaman's victims are 
Wordsworth, Browning, Byron, Morris, Eichard 
Wagner, and Mr. Austin. 

'Seven Lamps for the Teacher's Way,' published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co., is a reprint of an address 
given not long before his death by the late Frank 
A. Hill. In response to a considerable demand it 
has now been produced in booklet form, with a 
biographical sketch written by Mr. Kay Greene 
HuBng. 

Three new volumes in the charming ' Caxton Thin 
Paper Classics,' imported by the Messrs. Scribner, 
are the following: Swift's 'Journal to SteUa,' with 
other writings relating to Stella and Vanessa; 'The 
Travels of Marco Polo the Venetian,' in Marsden's 
translation, revised by Thomas Wright; and Eos- 
setti's 'Early Italian Poets,* ineludLig the 'Vita 
Nuova' of Dante. 

'The Holy Soman Empire,' by Mr. James Bryce, 
is republished by the MacmiUan Co. in a new 
edition, enlarged and revised throughout, with a 
chronological table of events, and three maps. It 
is now forty years since the first appearance of 
this work, and its qualities of sterling historical 
judgment and masterly philosophical condensation 
seem likely to keep it a standard work for at least 
another forty years. 

'The Napoleon Myth,' by Mr. Henry Bidgely 
Evans, is described as 'an occult study,' and is 
a curious contribution to the history of the Napo- 
leonic legend. It is accompanied by a translation 
of the 'Grand Erratum,' in which Jean-Baptiste 
Peres, writing in 1827, disproved the existence of 
Napoleon, a few years after the publication of 
Whately's 'Historic Doubts.' The Open Court 
Publishing Co. sends us this extremely interesting 
book.

FROM THE WEST TO THE WEST 

Across the Plains to Oregon 

With A chronicle and remarkable picture of a group of pioneers in their journeyings 
frontispiece across the plains and their subsequent settling in Oregon. The characters are of 
the distinctive class of Western emigrants of fifty years ago, resourceful, inde- 
pendent, and progressive, and in their conversation and experiences give a vivid account of a phase 
of American social life that has passed, as well as foreshadowing the active and productive period 
that was to follow. Though a faithful account of an actual journey, the book is in the form of 
fiction, and brings the course of several romances to a successful end. $1.50

This is the 20th printing of this distinguished Anglo-American automobile love story with scenes in France, Spain and Italy, which are both 
vividly portrayed by the authors and by pictures from photographs. There is also a frontispiece by Eliot Keen. 

Deledda's AFTER THE DIVORCE Translated by Maria Hornor Lansdale. $1.50. 

With this vivid novel Signora Deledda, already much admired in Italy and France, makes her American debut. The Critic, in speaking of 
her novels on Sardinian life, says she writes " with much charm, and the simple characters of the Sardignani are analyzed with consummate 
literary art." After the Divorce commences with a most dramatic murder trial, and turns on the law which makes divorce possible to the wife 
whose husband is a convict. The striking episodes that follow the trial are intensified by the picturesqueness of the scenes. 

Colton's THE BELTED SEAS $1.50. 

Arthur Colton, already very favorably known for his stories of New England and Ohio life, in the present book writes in a new and rollick- 
ing vein. His irrepressible Captain Buckingham, and the amusing verses that he constantly perpetrates, are apt to linger long in the reader's 
memory. The Captain's adventures in South America and elsewhere are certainly astonishing. 

Pattee's HOUSE OF THE BLACK RING $1.50. 

A story, full of the intense, simple life of the "Pennsylvania Dutch." It concerns the almost feudal Squire, his enemies, his fate and his 
daughter, and how she would have her way in love. Brooding over it all is the sinister force, the House of the Black Ring.

The Progress of Hellenism in Alexander's Empire 

By JOHN P. MAHAFFY, Sometime Professor of Ancient History in the University of Dublin

in this book epitomized the ripe conclusious of careful and painstaking research in the literature and other records of

These two volumes, in which Professor Loeb has collected the results of his experiments in general physiology during

ested in the phenomena of physical life. Doubtless many will be glad to have at their disposal the facts of Professor 
Loeb's experiments with salt solutions, the most notable result of which wa.s his discovery of artificial fertilization

The Messianic Hope in the New Testament 

By SHAILER MATHEWS, Professor in the University of Chicago 

The author, proceeding along historical lines, seeks to establish a criterion for determining to what extent the concepts 
of the New Testament writers were essential and to what extent formal ; or, in other words, to determine whether 
these concepts were of universal or of local application. The argument is built around iJie Messi»iic concept, occur- 
ring in the New Testament perhaps more frequently than any other, and quite obviously local and ethnic. The book 
is an interesting and instructive example of the historical method of studying the New Testament, although confined 
to a quite distinctive element in the narrative.

organizations for humanizing and enriching the life of 
Chicago, but it is an index of larger things remaining to 
be done. The book will have more than a local value. 
It should stimulate comparison with other cities and 
should lead to larger interests in promoting concerted 
movements for'prt^ress. — Axbiox W. SmaxXu

This book is not, on the one hand, a theoretical exposition of

description of the workings of the state and federal governments 
and their various departments. But ... an exposition of the 
principles of an established system ; . . . intended to afford to 
the reader an explanation of the important events of the history of 
our government, and the means of intelligently comprehending 
the problems constantly arising, the solution of which will make 
our constitutional history of the future. . . . If the book serves 
its purpose, it will enable the person who intelligently uses it to 
reach a rational and correct conception of the nature and meaning 
of the constitutions of the United States and of his state, and to 
understand the essential features of the governments provided for

A NEW BOOK BY W. E. N ORRIS. 
BARHAM OF BELTANA 

By W. E. NoRRis, Author of " Matrimony," " Mile. 

de Mersae," etc. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

The scenes of the book are laid in Tasmania, Malta, and, finally, 
in England. "Barham of Beltana," a wealthy colonist, was the 
son of a man who had been transported to Van Dieman's Land — 
wrongly as he declared — and the story deals largely with the 
efforts of the son to clear his father's memory. A love affair be- 
tween the Colonist's daughter and a young Englishman brings to- 
gether the descendants of the alleged victims of the convict and the 
Barham family, resulting in the clearing up of a good deal of mystery. 

SCENES FROM JEWISH LIFE

Way," " The Beryl Stones," etc. Crown 8vo. $1 .50. 

"Mrs. Sidgwick's bright manner of telling her stories, her 

delicate humor, and quick realization of the subtle pathos that is 

threaded through all Jewish life appear on every page, making the 

book interesting and enjoyable reading." — Westminster Oazttte. 

"' Scenes from Jewish Life ' discloses true feeling for human 
nature, and a considerable artistic gift. The book throughout is 
rational, sincere. Nothing is done to make unduly picturesque 
the scenes it contains. The stories are of credible men and women 
dealing with situations familiar in every-day life. Mrs. Sidgwick's 
plots are well founded, her style is simple, and she leaves an im- 
pression of interesting truth."— The Tribune (New York). 



THE CELESTIAL SURGEON 

By F. F. MoNTRESOR, Author of "The Alien," "At 

the Cross Roads," " Into the Highways and Hedges," 

etc. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

" . . . it is a joy to fall occasionally upon a novel like ' The 
Celestial Surgeon,' which, without a morbid or perplexing line, is 
full of interest and suggestion, and leaves us on kindly and hope- 
ful terms with our fellows and with renewed faith in the saving 
salt of honest purpose."- iVew York Timet. 

" A well-conceived and strongly written story of English 
life. . . . " — Newx (Newark). 

" . . . something more and better than the average novel : 
it is that rarest of new publications, a good novel, well conceived, 
well developed, well written. It is the kind of novel which makes 
the reader, who has come to the conclusion that genuine novels are 
no longer written, say : ' Here is the real thing after all. ' There 
is no straining after effect here, no conscious art ; Miss Montresor 
has a story to tell and a certain number of people to make us know. 
She tells that story and she paints those people so that we feel that 
we understand them." — Providence Journal.

A GENTLE MAN'S LIBRARY. 

Charles Lamb's reckoning of the books *no 
gentleman's library should be without ' would 
require some modifications to fit with our mod- 
ern notions. Giblx)n would still occupy a place 
in that supposititious collection, and possibly 
Hume. But we have our doubts about Robert- 
son, Beattie, and Soame Jenyns. The last- 
named person may have l)een, as Burke said 
of him, ' one of those who wrote, the purest 



English, that is, the most simple and alwrigi- 
nal language, the least qualified with foreign 
impregnations,' but the present age knows him 
not. Paley's 'Moral Philosophy' and the 
' Histories of Flavins Josephus (that learned 
Jew) ' may possibly still fill nooks in the 
libraries of 'modern gentlemen,' but they are 
there as corporeal hereditaments, not as pur- 
chases made of purpose prepense. ' Scientific 
Treatises ' are to 1)e found in great numbers, 
to be sure, but how different a matter is their 
science from that comprised in the term as 
Elia understood it! As for the miscellaneous 
items in Lamb's catalogue — ' Court Calendars, 
Directories, Pocket-Books, Draught Boards, 
bound and lettered on the back, Almanacs, 
Statutes at Large' — they have their modern 
analogues, no doubt, for the type they represent 
is persistent. A revised version of the essay- 
ist's list, adapted to our own American day and 
generation, might run somewhat as follows: 
Blue Books, City Ordinances, Automobile Cata- 
logues, and Club Registers, the ' works ' of Bal- 
zac, Washington, Corelli, and Tolstoy (in uni- 
form library sets), the Messages of the Presi- 
dents, Ben Hur, the Best Literature of the Uni- 
verse (sold by subscription), and the writings 
of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. And of such a list 
the l>ook-lover might ;<ay as Lamb said of his 
own : ' With these exceptions, I can read 
almost anything. I bless my stars for a taste 
so catholic, so unexcluding.' 

Tlie 'things in books' clothing' that perch 
upon our modem shelves offer a variety of vac- 
uity and a hollowness of pretension of which 
Lamb could hardly have dreamed. We were 
speaking not long ago of the ingenuity of sub- 
scription publishers in inventing new sorts of 
' Libraries ' — oratory, sermons, poetr}', wit and 
humor, elegant extracts, and what not — and 
of the skill of their agents in foisting these 
choice products of the printer's trade upon 
unwary or easily gullible victims. The nefari- 
ous business goes merrily on, and the commer- 
cial energ}' which prosecutes it shows no signs 
of al>atement. What a legacy is being prepared 
for the inheritors of these showy stores of 
literary hmilDcr! What a time 'the child in 
the house ' is going to have as he grows up : 
and the roots of his young life strike blindly 
through this mould in their search for nutri- 
ment I We have often reflected upon the 
melancholy fortune of that luckless child. His 
predecessor of a generation or two ago (con-

[March 16, 



cerning whom the literature of biography has 
revealed so many interesting particulars) had 
access to no great store of books, but, however 
restricted the pasture afforded for his brows- 
ings, there was a fair chance that it would 
yield a ' Gulliver,' or a ' Tom Jones,' or a ' Eob- 
inson Crusoe,' and very likely all three of them. 
A 'Pilgrim's Progress,' an 'Arabian Nights,' 
and a Fox's ' Martyrs ' were pretty sure to be 
found in cupboard or garret, clothed in respect- 
able ancient garb, redolent of mystery and 
romance. The battered Shakespeare and the 
few old 'Waverleys' that rarely failed to be 
discovered somewhere offered a passport to the 
whole realm of the imagination, and were fed 
upon as manna from heaven. With such 
incitements, the instinct of youth was wont 
to grope its way toward the light of literature, 
and to build up wholesome tastes upon the most 
solid of foundations. 

How different is the fate of the modern 
youth ! To begin with, he is sent to the school 
of our new mechanical fashion, and scientific 
pedagogy wreaks its will upon him. He is 
taught 'literature' — Heaven save the mark! 
— by means of manuals and ingeniously-chosen 
texts, and his soul revolts. That this particu- 
larly obnoxious form of worriment should have 
any real relation to life, let alone to pleasur- 
able experience, is the last idea that ever enters 
his mind. Left to his own devices he might 
have found his way into many a treasure-house 
or pleasance of letters, but once having learned 
to look upon authors and their work as ticketed 
and classified objects of study, he relegates lit- 
erature to the list of disagreeable things that 
the tyranny of his elders forces him to endure 
for a season, but that no rational boy or girl 
would think of counting among the pleasures 
of life. With much toilsome constraint of his 
tender childish faculties he has been taught 
to read, and then he is given literary apples 
of Sodom for the reward of his labors and the 
disenchantment of his sense. Later in life, 
when the pressure of his environment forces 
him to find something to read, he wastes him- 
self upon inanities; the vulgarity of the news- 
paper becomes his intellectual pabulum, the 
triviality of the popular magazine his means of 
mental recreation. 

Meanwhile, books (of a sort) have been all 
around him. If his lot has been cast among 
the well-to-do, he has had within his reach the 
' gentleman's library ' of our theme. If not, 
he has had its humbler analogue, the bookcase 
filled with spoil of the department store and 
the bargain sale. Xow the trouble with this 
' gentleman's library ' (and its cheap substi- 
tute) is that it is woefully undiscriminating. 
The proportion of wheat to chaff, of bread to 



sack, is so small that the ' child in the house/ 
even if his healthy natural instincts have es- 
caped perversion at the hands of his pedagogues, 
has small chance of finding the wholesome 
nourishment that the family bookshelves would 
still probably afford if put to the right uses. 
Moreover, the very idea of literature is cheap- 
ened and vulgarized by the quantity of printed 
matter thus easily to be got at. How can books 
be precious things if multiplied in this reck- 
less fashion, and thrust upon a child's atten- 
tion from all sides? And how can any mere 
book in covers hope to compete with the glories 
of the Sunday newspaper with its colored comic 
supplements ? 

The ' gentleman's library ' of Lamb's detes- 
tation was not, we shrewdly suspect, a source 
of great literary satisfaction to its possessor. 
It was the mark of respectability, of station in 
life, and perhaps of affluence. Its modern 
prototype is the mark of all these things, dis- 
played with an exaggeration of pretension that 
comports with the other aspects of modern 
extravagance. It is apt to be viewed by its 
owner as so much furniture bought by the yard, 
as so much binding made to match the other 
upholstery. It may be safely averred that the 
books it contains are not read. In some cases, 
the notion of their being read is flouted by 
their very appearance. We recall certain edi- 
tions of Dickens and George Eliot and Shake- 
speare designed for the very purpose of making 
it impossible to read them. Such books are 
architecture, not literature; the amateurs of 
editions de liLxe may describe them as ' noble 
tomes,' and take pride in their possession, but 
the lover of books (in the Avarm human sense) 
would not have them as a gift. 

But whether physically readable or not, these 
collections of ' authors ' stand on the shelf 
unhandled, and grow from year to year with 
the incapacity of their owners to enjoy the 
bounty which literature so liberally offers to 
its elect. Like the schoolboy of whom it was 
said that much classical study had given him 
no a.cquaintance with Greek and Latin, but 
only the firm conviction that those languages 
existed, so the ' gentleman ' whose ' library ' we 
are now discussing may be said to have a firm 
conviction that the ' authors ' exist, but no 
notion whatever of the reason for their exist- 
ence. Thus is education justified of her chil- 
dren; thus, in other words, does the mechani- 
cal teaching of facts about literature bear fruit 
in the mechanical acquisition of 'standard 
sets,' for the encouragement of the sharp- 
sighted manufacturer of books and the faithful 
editorial hacks whom he employs. That our 
modern multiplication of editions is the index 
to a corresponding increase in literary culture

and appreciation is about the last hypothesis 
that would be framed by a philosopher seeking 
to account for the 'gentleman's library' as it 
exists in our dav and generation. 



COMM UNICA TIOX. 

SHAKESPEARE'S ^SECONT) BEST BED.' 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A writer in the issue of The Dial for March 1 
refers to the clause in Shakespeare's will by 
which he left to his wife his 'second best bed'; a 
clause that has been often mentioned as indicat- 
ing that the poet had but little affection for his 
partner in life and the mother of his children. 
I have never seen in print any explanation of a 
testamentary disposition that was not uncom- 
mon, I believe, in wills of that period ; but there 
is an explanation which, I think, is perfectly 
satisfactory, and which relieves the poet of the 
imputation of having put a slight on his wife. 

The question has often been asked. If Shakes- 
peare really entertained affection for his wife, 
why did he not leave her his best bed? The 
answer is that under an existing custom which 
had the force of law he had no power to do so, 
the best bed of a land-owner being an heirloom, 
a species of personal property which upon the 
death of the proprietor goes along with the land 
to the heir, and of which the heir cannot be de- 
prived by a last will and testament. 

'The term heirloom,' according to Bouvier's 
Law Dictionary, 'is applied to those chattels 
which are considered as annexed and necessary 
to the enjoyment of the inheritance.' It in- 
cludes title papers to lands, together with the 
chest in which they are contained, the keys of a 
house, fish in a pond, deer in a park, family tomb- 
stones and moniunents, family portraits, pews in 
churches, etc. 

In Shakespeare's time the best bed of a land- 
owner was an heirloom by custom recognized as 
law in many parts of England. Thus Sir Edward 
Coke, who was a contemporary of Shakespeare, 
says: 'And note that in some places chattels 
as heirlooms (as the best bed. table, pot, pan, 
cart and other dead chattels movable) may go to 
the heire and the heire in that case may have 
an action for them at the common law' (Coke 
on Littleton, IS a, 18 b, L. I. C. Sec. 12). 

Blackstone gives in quaint language the reason 
why heirlooms cannot be bequeathed by will. He 
says: 'Yet they [heirlooms] being at his [the 
testator's] death instantly vested in the heir, the 
devise (which is subsequent and not to take effect 
till after his death) shall be postponed to the 
custom whereby they have already descended' 
(4 Blackstone 's Commentaries, p. 429). 

That this custom was regarded in drawing the 
will of Shakespeare, and that the wUl does not 
in the least tend to show that he was wanting in 
natural affection for his wife, would seem to be 
obvious. R.

Thackeray d* America.* 



Those of us who are like Mr. Andrew Lang 
in being able to say of Thackeray, ' G'est mon 
homme/ have been particularly fortunate of 
late. The recently-published ' Letters of Thack- 
eray to an American Family' and Grcneral 
James Grant Wilson's ' Thackeray in the United 
States ' are books of quite exceptional interest. 
As to the first, it may be with a somewhat 
uneasy gratitude that we accept what is offered 
us. The old question of our right to such a gift 
arises with peculiar insistence in the case of 
Thackeray, whom we know to have shrunk from 
all that biography and its accompaniments im- 
plied to him. It would decidedly simplify this 
and similar problems for us, and help besides to 
dispose of one of the most troublesome points of 
literary ethics, if we could be given some oppor- 
tunity of proving our fitness for the privilege 
we enjoy. There would doubtless be some diffi- 
culties in the way of devising a suitable plan for 
the establishment of our qualifications, as well 
as in the selection of those entrusted with, the 
duty of applying the test. Even an authorized 
biographer — as in the case of Carlyle, for ex- 
ample, — might not give universal satisfaction if 
appointed as a judge of candidates ; nor would 
all the advantages of intimacy and collaboration 
have rendered Henley entirely acceptable to sill 
Stevensonians. The suggestion, it must be ad- 
mitted, is not very practicable. Our reading of 
letters will probably continue unlicensed, and 
those of us who have importunate consciences 
can, as Sir Leslie Stephen puts it in his discus- 
sion of the Browning Letters, atone for our en- 
joyment of contraband goods by vigorously abus- 
ing the smuggler. Yet in some cases that 
atonement fails to be complete. In reading 
Thackerars letters we should be the better sat- 
isfied for some definite warrant for considering 
ourselves other than mere curious impertinents ; 
and lacking such warrant, it is with a half- 
guilty pleasure that we welcome the new vol- 
ume. 

It is not far from a score of years since the 
publication of the Brookfield Letters left little 
room for further revelation of Thackeray's per- 
sonality. Since that time, and with the addi- 
tional evidence of the portrait given us by Mrs. 
Eitchie in the * Biographical Edition,' the old

charge of cj'nicism has bt'cn silenced, or men- 
tioned, only to be indignantly disproved. In- 
deed, some of us have l>een so anxious to free 
the creator of Colonel Newcome and of Helen 
Pendennis from tihe unpleasant connotations of 
the word ' cynic ' that we have been quite ready 
to forget what text it was he loved to treat on, 
and will have it that Charlotte Bronte's "^lion 
that came out of Judah ' roarecl us very gently 
indeed. And yet the recollection of Mr. Den- 
ceaee and Lady GriflBn, of Catherine and her 
Galgenstein, no less than of Colonel iSTewcome 
and the Lamberts, belongs to a real apprecia- 
tion of the letters. The possibilities of the scBva 
indigimtio of the satirist bring into higher relief 
the tenderness that was always part of the man. 
The recently-published 'Letters to an Amer- 
ican Family ' cover the period from 1852, the 
date of Thackeray's first visit to America, to 
within a year of his death. Writing to ]\Irs. 
Brookfield. early in 1853, he says: 

'Have you heard that I have found Beatrix at 
New York? I have basked in her bright eyes; but 
ah me! I don't care for her, and shall hear of hex- 
marrying a New York buck with the gi'eatest pleas- 
ure. She is really as like Beatrix as that fellow 
William and I met was like Costigan. She has a 
dear woman of a mother, upwards of fifty-five, 
whom I like the best and think the handsomest, — 
a sweet lady.' 

Tlie bright eyes belonged to Miss Sally Bax- 
ter, and the Baxter home at Second Avenue and 
Eighteenth Street soon became to him ' the 
Brown House,' the place he had ' learned to love 
best in Xew York.' A few weeks after his re- 
turn he writes from Kensington : 

'I hope, please God, that the love and friendship 
I have had in your family may even go so far as 
to do some public benefit, — the remembrance of 
you all sanctifies your country in my eyes. When 
people speak here sneeringly, as Londoners will 
talk, I break out indignantly and tell them how 
much good and worth and love and good-breeding 
there is in the country of which they talk so flip- 
pantly. And I pray Heaven it may be my chance, 
as it will be my endeavor, to be a peacemaker 
between us and you, and to speak good-will toward 
you. ' 

In a letter written after his second visit, he 
says: 

'I felt glad, somehow, to contribute to a thread 
that shall tie our two countries together; for though 
I don't love America, I love Americans with all 
my heart, — and I dare say you know what family 
taught me to love them.' 

It was the press which provoked the qualifica- 
tion from him ; the newspapers had ' man- 
aged to offend and insult the most friendly 
stranger that ever entered our country or quit- 
ted it.' But the journalistic offences, happily 
forgotten now, were not publicly resented, ex- 
cept perhaps in the tone of a few sentences in 
the Eoundabout paper, 'Half a Loaf.' The at- 
titude of the writer, as well as of the man, re- 



mained ' inciirably friendly to America,' and we 
have Ethel Newcome, the heroine into wiiom 
he translated his American Beatrix, and much 
of ' The Virginians,' to remind us of Thack- 
eray's visit to the country that hardly more 
than a decade earlier had served to suggest Eden 
and Elijah Pogram, Hannibal Chollop and Jef- 
ferson Brick to Dickens. 

The letters, as was to be expected from the 
nature of Thackeray's relations to his corre- 
s|X)ndents, chronicle for the most part little but 
the moods of the writer. There are character- 
istic comments upon ' The Newcomes ' and 
' The Virginians ' during the time of their 
publication. 

'I'm in low spirits about the Newcomes. It's 
not good. It's stupid. It haunts me like a great 
stupid ghost. It says, why do you go on writing 
this rubbish? You are old, you have no more inven- 
tion, etc. Write sober books, books of history; 
leave novels to younger folks. ' 

And of ' The Virginians,' he says : 

'The book's clever but stupid; that's the fact. 
I hate story-making, — incidents, surprises, love- 
making, etc., — more and more every day; and here 
is a third of a great story done , . . and noth- 
ing actually has happened except that a young gen- 
tleman has come from America to England. I wish 
an elderly one could do t'other thing. . . The 
public does not care about the story, nor about the 
Virginians; nor I about either.' 

More plainly in these letters than in any other 
records, we can see how strangely soon Thack- 
eray Ijecame old. Always, as a writer, removed 
from youth by a far greater distance than his 
years would warrant, he seems to find himself 
an old man at a time when his contemporaries 
are scarcely yielding to middle-age. 

'I used to have some reminiscences and feelings 
of youth left Avhen I was 42; now I am near 43, 
and no grandfather can be more glum. I sleep like 
a monk, with a death 's-head in my room. ' ' Come, ' ' 
says the cheerful monitor, "rouse yourself. Finish 
Newcomes. Get a few thousand pounds more, my 
man, for those daughters of yours. For your time 
is short, and the sexton wants you. You have been 
in this world long enough. You have had enough 
champagne and feasting — travelling, novel-reading, 
novel-writing, yawning, grumbling, falling in love, 
and the like. You are too old for these amuse- 
ments, and what other occupation are jou fit for? 
Get 200 £ a year apiece for your girls and their 
poor mother, and then come to me." ' 

What may have been something of an assmnp- 
tion in earlier days had grown into a realitv' 
long before his death. In all but brain, he had 
become prematurely old. Dickens, looking at 
him as he lay in his coffin, noted that his hands 
were like tliose of a man of eighty. 

As to that ■w'hich gives the letters their great- 
est value to Thackerayans, — the intimately per- 
sonal tone of many of the passages, — comment, 
as in the case of the Brookfield Letters, seems 
almost an impertinence. Tliere are letters

appreciative criticism of Thackeray's letter- 
writdng style. The Bernstein's letter to Madam 
Esmond Warrington in * The A'irginians,' 
Madame de Florae's letter to Colonel Xewcome, 
the Amiens letter that makes Philip Fir- 
min's Charlotte, so hopelessly tiresome at 
other times, really endurable when she writes 
it, are all perfect of their kind, and might suc- 
eessfiilly be used to illustrate the dictimi that 
Thackeray was at his best as a letter-writer. 
But the discussion of the charm of these letters, 
written in grateful affection to his friends, is 
another matter. And to th^t it seems most 
fitting to bring the remembrance of a phrase 
of Thackera}-'s own, uttered by the not unduly 
sentimental critic Michael Angelo Tirmarsh, — 
' A great clapping of hands is but a coarse sort 
of s}"mpathy." 

General Wilson's long-expectetl volmues are 
the outcome of his articles on * Thackeray in the 
United States,' publislied some years ago in 
' The Century Magazine.' In them he has 
brought together much interesting material 
which has heretofore been scattered througliout 
scores of memoirs and recollections, besides a 
considerable number of unpublished letters and 
drawings. For the very beautiful form of these 
volumes, the publishers deserve the gratitude of 
every lover of artistically-made books; and 
the contents will be appreciated by every Thack- 
erayan, in spite of the fact that the pleas- 
ant discursiveness of reminiscence reminds 
us of Lowell's suggestion for an imaginary 
biography of Thackeray, modelled on Professor 
Masson's Milton, and to be entitled ' A Life of 
Thackeray, or Who was Who in England, 
France and Germany during the Second Quarter 
of the Xineteenth Century.' 

A noteworthy feature of the many excellent 
illustrations is the number of portraits, from 
the bust of Thackeray as a boy in 1822 (the 
singular resemblance of which to the later like- 
nesses in contour and expression must strike 
every one who has seen the replica in the 
Xational Portrait Gallery), to the posthumotis 
Gilbert portrait l^elonging to the Eefomi Club. 
Among the drawings reproduced, perhaps none 
is more distinctly Thackerayan than the page- 
ful of caps drawn for Mrs. Lowell on board tlie 
■ Canada ' in 1852, — they were fortunate trav- 
ellers on that voyage who had Thackeray, 
Lowell, and Clough for fellow-passengers I 
There are a couple of passengers' c-aps, thor- 
oughly individualized ; ' Captain Byles, his 
hat ; " the familiar spectacled Titmarsh in his 
high round cap; and under the pointed liell- 
topi>ed headgear in the comer the characteristic 
legend ' Everybody's cap.' There is a very full 
liibliography and a list of Tliackerayana, the 



latter c-ontaining the curious error of a substitu- 
tion of • Lothair ' for ' Coningsby ' in a refer- 
ence to Thackeray's burlesque of Disraeli. 

Both of Thackeray's visits to Ameriea were 
quite uneventful, so that their chief histor}-, 
apart from the lectures ( which were successful, 
though not sensationally so), is the record of 
the pleasant relations established between the 
novelist and our countrATnen. He was fortunate 
in his associations. He saw only the best of 
us, — the best side even of slavery. A letter to 
Miss Perry and her sisters, published for the 
first time, gives us an attractive glimpse of him 
at Baltimore, and a bit of Emersonian criticism 
as well. 

'I have done pretty well at Baltimore, and am 
much aflfected by the kindness of a provincial 
Warrington there, who has done all his might to 
make me happy and is pleased to regard me with 
a kindness — I was going to say admiration, 
which some folks will not be angry with him for 
feeling. . . . The spectacles were moistened 
somehow by his goodness and attachment — a fel- 
low of remarkable reading, too. . . . He thought 
so well of us that I was quite frightened, and felt 
a Domlne non sum dignus. Bon Dieu — how I 
should like to be as good as that fellow thinks me 
to be I He gave me Emerson's Essays, which I had 
never read — have you ? They are very wise and 
benevolent, — they come to very like conclusions to 
those which the Worldling who writes these pres-. 
ents to you teaches sometimes — and as I read 
honest Emerson I fancy I have known it aU before. ' 

Ttiough the 'Brown House in the Second 
Avenue ' found no rival, the greatest number 
of friendships seems to have been formed with 
the Philadelphians. There was talk of a con- 
sulship in Philadelphia ; and in a letter to Mr. 
W. B. Reed, Thackeray comments upon the sug- 
gestion. 

'There are half a dozen houses I already know in 
Philadelphia where I could find very pleasant 
friends and company, and that good old library 
would give me plenty of acquaintances more. But, 
home among my parents there, and some few friends 
I have made in the last twenty-five years, and a 
tolerably fair prospect of an honest livelihood, on 
the familiar London flagstones, and the library at 
the Athenafum, and the ride in the Park, and the 
pleasant society afterwards, and a trip to Paris 
now and again, and to Switzerland and Italy in 
the summer. — these are little temptations which 
make me not discontented with my lot, about which 
I grumble only for pastime, and because it is an 
Englishman 's privilege. Own, now, that all these 
recreations here enumerated have a pleasant sound. ' 

The consulship, like the wished-for position 
as the artist of * Pickwick ' after Se^Tuour s 
death in 1837. and like the seat for Oxford 
that ^Ir. Cardwell filled, twenty years later, is 
one of the possibilities of Thackeray's career 
that set us to wondering liow much we should 
liave lost or gained by their realization.

When the ghost of the E-everend Laurence 
Sterne, appearing to the writer of the Eound- 
about Papers at Dessein's Hotel in 1862, put the 
question 'How man}- authors of your present 
time will last till the next century ? ' we have no 
way of being sure how Thackeray answered the 
query as far as his own writings were concerned. 
In his estimate of his work there was always a 
curious mixture of self-distrust and recognition 
of his powers which makes it difficult to guess 
how long a lease of fame he would have given 
himself. The question, as most questions will 
do, has answered itself. There are mentioned 
in the list referred to not far from fifteen hun- 
dred articles in American periodicals dealing 
with Thackeray. The interest of readers, if 
the number of such articles is anything of a 
guide, appears to show no signs of lessening, 
but to increase almost yearly; and Thackeray-

A Cooperative History of America.* 

Anyone who reads, with due attention, the 
'Editor's Introduction to the Series' prefixed 
to the first volume of ' The American Nation,' 
will agree that therein these truths are held to 
be self-evident: that a new history of the 
United States, extending from the discovery 
down to the present time, is needed; that no 
such comprehensive work by a competent writer 
is now in existence; that, for an intelligent 
summarizing of the present knowledge of 
American history by trained specialists, and 
for a complete work written in untechnical style 
which shall serve for the instruction and enter- 
tainment of the general reader, there is but one 
method, the cooperative; that previous efforts 
of this sort have not been altogether happy; 
that this series is to avoid such unfortunate 
difficulties as were evident in previous ven- 
tures; that every volume in tihis series must 
stand the double test of accuracy and readable- 
ness ; and that it is the editors function to see 
that the links of the chain are adjusted to each 
other, end to end, and that no considerable 
subjects are omitted. 

All these bold statements of fact and inten- 
tion we find in the editor's introduction. Else-

where we learn that assistance has been received 
from various historical societies, notably those 
of Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Virginia, and 
Texas. The selection of the authors of the 
individual volumes ( of which there are to be 
twenty-six in all, with one volume of index 
and one of maps ) seems to have been entirely 
the editor's function, and most of the choices 
made are happy. The whole series is divided 
into five groups, each of which deals with an 
important epoch in American history. The 
division into groups, volumes, and chapters 
makes in itself a topical analysis of no small 
value. 

As would be expected, each volume contains 
an author's preface; besides this, however, to 
each volume lie editor contributes another intro- 
duction. Here in a pleasant manner Professor 
Hart tells the reader what he will find in the 
volume, how important this is, how the author 
has emphasized this or that point, and how the 
matters discussed in this volume are to be 
' linked ' to those treated elsewhere. This part 
of the work may be serviceable to many readers 
who share the prevailing hunger for predi- 
gested food; the same idea is followed out in 
another cooperative history of America now in 
course of publication. It does not seem, how- 
ever, to be a characteristic of the best of those 
European collaborations which in other respects 
have been models to the editor of ' The Ameri- 
can Nation.' 

From the general plan outlined by the editor 
we turn to the individual volumes. Somewhat 
in the nature of a prelude is Professor Chey- 
ney's ' European Background of American His- 
tory, 1300-1600.' The author of this volume 
has had a difficult task, and has done it admir- 
ably. It is his part to tell, without too much 
detail, .a story already familiar and covering a 
number of widely different subjects. This he 
must do without impairing the accuracy of his 
work or losing the reader's interest. Beginning 
with the later mediaeval period, he traces the 
growth of commerce, exploration, and discov- 
ery, the work of Portugal and of Spain, and 
the political institutions of the great states of 
Europe that later were the chief colonizers. 
Then follows a fresh and succinct discussion of 
the rise and influenc-e of commercial and col- 
onizing companies. After this, the narrative 
returns to the European centre, and sketches 
briefly the course of the Eeformation on the 
Continent and in England. The last part of 
the volume deals Avith the constitution, and 
especially with the local government, civil and 
ecclesiastical, of England, the necessary pro- 
legomena to the constitutional history of the 
English colonies in America. 

From the very nature of Professor Chey- 



1905.] 



THE DIAL. 



191 



nej^'s work, it is not to be expected that all 
parts of it shall be equally the results of per- 
sonal investigation, or based upon other tiian 
secondary materials. The story is told dehght- 
fully and with care; but the necessity for com- 
pression causes occasionally a lack of clearness. 
For example, with reference to the constitu- 
tion of the London Company under the charter 
of 1609, the author states : 

'The form of government of the Company in 
England received much attention in the charter, 
as well it might after the failure of the arrange- 
ments of the former charter. The membership, 
quarterly assemblies of the general body of the 
members, more frequent meetings of a governing 
council of fifty-three officers, and their duties, were 
all minutely formulated' (pp. 151-2), 

As a matter of fact, the provision for the 
quarterly courts was included in the third 
charter, that of 1612, which is not mentioned 
by Professor Cheyney at all. 

We are now ready for the play to begin ; but 
must wait, for here follows Professor Far- 
rand's volume upon ' The Basis of American 
History.' This inevitably breaks the conti- 
nuity of the narrative. We pass from English 
history and institutions to the physical 
features, flora and fauna, prehistoric inhab- 
itants, and Indian tribes of America. The 
author himself informs us that his ta^sk has 
been one of condensation, and the results are 
especially evident in the fijst third of the vol- 
ume, which is somewhat below the general aver- 
age of interest. For example, the statistics 
upon pp. 48-53 do not gain by being printed 
out instead of being tabulated in figures. The 
chief service of this portion of the book will 
be its suggestiveness and the references in Pro- 
fessor Farrand's excellent bibliography. 

As to the much-vexed questions of American 
anthropolog}' and ethnology, — the genuineness 
of human remains in tertiary deposits, the evi- 
dences of pre-glacial man, the identity of the 
mound-builders, and the origin of the Ameri- 
can Indian, — Professor Farrand takes a con- 
servative position, and approves the prevailing 
skepticism. Likewise, in his chapters upon the 
Indians, he controverts many popular generali- 
zations, such as the exaggerated estimate of 
the power of the chief, the idea of the complete 
subjection of the squaw, the misunderstanding 
of the Indian's ' stoicism ' with respect to pain. 
These are examples of a widespread misinfor- 
mation; and in the relations of the whites to 
the Indians, and especially in the policy of the 
Federal Government, the mistakes of history 
are seen to have been due to ignorance and 
folly rather than to deliberate ill-intent. 

Having listened to the prelude and scrutin- 
ized the play-bill,- we welcome the story of 



action, which begins with Professor Bourne's 
volume on * Spain in America.' A few pages 
of prolegomena lead us at once to the life of 
Columbus. The author holds the recent attack 
of Vignaud upon the genuineness of Tosca- 
nelli's letters to Columbus to have been unsuc- 
cessful, but believes that, if genuine^ the letters 
did not give Columbus much information, — 
at most, they only turned his mind to the 
problem. The story of his long endeavor to 
gain the support of the Spanish monaichs is 
abbreviated, and we are soon brought to the 
eve of the great voyage. 

'The son of the humble woollen-weaver of Genoa 
has gone far in twenty years. He is now a noble, 
and a high official in an ancient monarchy, and 
intrusted with a unique mission. Yet all depends 
upon the chances of the voyage whether these 
honors shall fade away in the mists of the Sea of 
Darkness, leaving the mere shadow of a name, like 
Ugolino de Vivaldi, in some such record as this: 
"Christopher Colonus, a Ligurian, proposed to pas3 
over to the Indies by way of the west. After 
he left the Canary Islands, no news was heard of 
him/' or whether his name shall have eternal 
celebrity as the discoverer of the New World. No 
man ever faced chances of fortune so extreme. 
On the other hand, no sovereign ever secured 
imperial domain at so slight a sacrifice as Isabella 
of Castile. Her venture was small — a few thousand 
dollars and presumably empty honors to an impor- 
tunate visionary whose utterances seemed mere 
"fables" ' (pp. 18-19). 

This is a fair sample of the many striking 
summaries of events and characterizations of 
individuals which one finds throughout the 
book. Of similar impressiveness is the author's 
final estimate of Columbus (pp. 82-83), the 
comparison of Columbus with Magellan (pp. 
127-128), the outline of the new conditions 
that confronted the explorer in Yucatan 
(p. 151), the conclusions as to Amerigo Ves- 
pucci (p. 103), and the resume of the results 
attained after three generations of conquest 
(ch. xiii). 

The narrative of exploration takes up, 
roughly, two-thirds of the volume; the 
remainder is devoted to an account of Spanish 
colonial policy^ and of its results as worked 
out in Spanish America, which is even more an 
original contribution to Ajnerican history than 
the first part of the work. Professor Bourne's 
discussion of the Pace Elements and Social 
Conditions in Spanish America, and his chap- 
ter on Spanish Experience with Xegro Slaves, 
possess, in addition to their value as history, a 
peculiar usefulness for those citizens of the 
United States today who wish to gain insight 
into the psychology of the Spanish-speaking 
peoples recently added to our territorial popu- 
lation, or into the character of those states with 
which commercial relations will henceforth 
bring us more and more into contact.

THE DIAI. 



[March 16, 



Professor Bourne shows that the badly 
administered justice and the financial corrup- 
tion found throughout Spanish America were 
in direct violation of the efforts and intentions 
of the government. He gives us a keen criti- 
cism of the traditional view of Las Casas and 
the Spanish enslaving of Indians. Las Casas 
he calls 'the Lloyd G-arrison of Indian rights.' 

'It is as one-sided to depict the Spanish Indian 
policy primarily from his pages as it would be to 
write a history of the American negro question 
exclusively from the files of the "Liberator," or 
after a century of American rule in the Philip- 
pines to judge it solely from the anti-imperialistic 
tracts of the last few years' (p. 257). 

Xot only did Spain begin negro slavery in 
the New World; she also furnished the first 
abolitionist. Before either the Pennsylvania 
Quakers or Judge Sewall had made their pro- 
tests, the Jesuit Alphonso Sandoval in the 
beginning of the seventeenth century attacked 
both the institution and the trade in his work 
' De Instauranda Aethiopum Salute.' 

The last chapter gives a sketch of the trans- 
mission of Spanish culture to the New World, 
and leads to this conclusion : 

'If we compare Spanish America with the United 
States a hundred years ago, we must recognize that 
while in the North there was a sounder party 
politic, a purer social life, and a more general 
dissemination of elementary education, yet in 
Spanish America there were both vastly greater 
wealth and greater poverty, more imposing monu- 
ments of civilization, such as public buildings, 
institutions of learning, and hospitals, more popu- 
lous and richer cities, a higher attainment in certain 
branches of science. No one can read Humboldt's 
account of the City of Mexico and its establish- 
ments for the promotion of science and the fine 
arts without realizing that, whatever may be the 
superiority of the United States in these respects, 
they have been mostly the gains of the age of 
steam' (pp. 315-316). 

'The Spanish American peoples have lacked the 
inspiration of united action, and their resources 
and powers have been frittered away in intestine 
quarrels. If the formidable apparition of the ever 
extending United States draws them together for 
mutual defense; if the construction of railroads 
sufficiently overcomes the great geographical impedi- 
ments to unity; if the Monroe Doctrine shall servo 
the temporary purpose of protecting them from 
foreign attack during this period of mutual 
approach — there may yet arise a great Spanish- 
American federal State, the counterpart of the 
United States, to become a wholesome check on the 
indefinite absorption of alien lands and peoples to 
the south, and the home of a great people which 
with the infusion of new blood will free itself from 
the evils of its earlier life while preserving the 
best of the heritage from Spain' (pp. 317-318). 

In the volume on ' England in America,' 
President Lyon G. Tyler has given us a scrupu- 
lously fair and a very interesting work. The 
field is one in which there have been many 
workers, and this volume does not exhibit the 



freshness of scholarship that characterizes Pro- 
fessor Bourne's work. The author gives us 
no detailed study of institutional growth, but 
a general narrative. Here one inevitably com- 
pares President Tyler's work with that of the 
late Mr. Fiske, with results not at all to the 
disadvantage of President Tyler. 

Captain John Smith's deeds are told at some 
length, and President T\'Ter finds time to make 
a plea for the Pocahontas story. The progress 
of Virginia after 1G24 is made more clear than 
is usually the case. The chapter upon Mary- 
land and the thorny questions of religion 
exhibits admirable calmness of judgment. The 
account of New England shows no lack of 
appreciation of the sterling qualities of the 
Puritan society, though the tone is by no means 
that of the ' hagiology ' of Massachusetts his- 
torians. There is little room for detailed dis- 
cussions, so we find still ' Tlie introduction of 
negro slavery' in 1619, with no reference here 
or in the bibliography to Dr. Ballagh's strong 
argument that this was not ' slavery ' in the 
later sense of the term. Again, to the struggle 
of Lord Baltimore with the Jesuits is devoted 
a single sentence, and Professor Dennis's val- 
uable article on this subject is unnoticed. The 
account of the Fundamental Orders of Con- 
necticut is the traditional one, with which it is 
helpful to compare that of Professor Osgood 
in his book on " The American Colonies.' 

Into a single chapter entitled ' Colonial 
Neighbors' is compressed all that is said by 
President Tyler about the lieginning of New 
France and of New Netherland. In the case of 
New France, we are promised a separate vol- 
ume, ' France in America,' by Professor 
Thwaites; but that just five pages should be 
devoted to the narrative of Dutch colonization 
seems to show a lack of proportion. Unfor- 
tunately, even this condensation is not very 
successful, for several omissions and inaccuracies 
are found. Hudson receives very meagre treat- 
ment; William LTsselincx's name is not men- 
tioned except in connection with Gustavus 
Adolphus; the story of the English protest to 
the States General, in 1621, and of the answer 
of the Dutch Government to this protest, is 
not wholly correct; the charter to the West 
India Company did not give ' only an exclusive 
right to trade,' for, as Professor Cheyney 
points out, it distinctly permitted colonization. 
Peter Minuit did not in 1626 succeed ^Fay. but 
Yerhulst, who held the directorship after May. 
The charter of privileges and exemptions was 
granted by the company to the patrooiis, with 
the approval of the government: hence it is 
hardly correct to speak of the company ' obtain- 
ing a new charter' (pp. 291-29.5). Finally,

tliere is very decided need of ' linking '" between 
the account of New Xetherland where Presi- 
dent Tyler leaves it, and the story where Pro- 
fessor Andrews takes it up. 

The fifth volume and the last of this group 
is an account of ' Colonial Self -Government ' 
by Prof. C. McL. Andrews, which continues 
through 1G89 the story begun by President 
Tyler. This is very certainly the best general 
account of this period that has yet apjjeared. 
One feels that the author not only has intimate 
acquaintance with the old sources, but also has 
been fortunate enough to reach considerable 
new material. This appears especially in the 
clear account of the commercial code of Great 
Britain and of the organs of administration 
that were developed ; in the description of the 
successive councils that led up to the perma- 
nent Board of Trade and Plantations estab- 
lished in 1696, and of the plans for the control 
of the colonies and for their union for defensive 
purposes. Professor Andrews is especially to 
\)G congratulated upon the catholic view of 
colonial histor\- that he presents to us. 

As successful as his descriptions of institu- 
tions is the author's delineation of personality. 
In the story of Pennsylvania, for example, Wil- 
liam Penn's own intentions and acts are kept 
to the front, yet without any suggestion of 
hero-worship. Penn, we learn, was morally 
justified in his Iwundary controversy with the 
Baltimores, but Professor Andrews's conciession 
tliat ' the technical right lay with Baltimore, 
and we cannot admire Penn's inclination to 
ignore it' (p. 247) evidences his desire to be 
absolutely impartial. Again, the traditional 
]ucture of Andros, drawn largely from Xew 
ICngland sources, is subjected to sharp criti- 
cism, and we are told that ' as compared with 
many other colonial governors, he was upright, 
sympathetic and faithful' (p. 93). 

Professor Andrews finishes his narrative with 
the stor}' of the Eevolution of 1689 as it devel- 
oped in Massachusetts. ^Maryland, and Xew 
York. Of Maseachusetts he states, in conclu- 
sion: *^ When in 1691 a revised charter was 
granted, it created a government of the type 
of Xew York or Xew Jerse}', instead of the old 
|K)pular government' (p. 379). A discussion 
of this charter does not belong to this volume, 
and still less to the present review, but cer- 
tainly there were very marked differences 
between the government of Massachusetts under 
it, and that of Xew York. 

The description of the social, economic, and 
religious conditions within the colonies is here 
and there hardly so carefully worked out as 
the study of governmental institutions. Though 
lie refers to President Tyler's chapter on the 



subject. Professor Andrews seems to ignore the 
former's conclusions as to education in the 
southern colonies, and to stick fast to Gov- 
ernor Berkeley's well-worn thanksgivings over 
the non-existence of free schools in Virginia. 
Again the account given of the commercial 
legislation, which is so helpful in its outline of 
the purpose of these laws and of their history, 
is less satisfactorj'^ when it comes to telling just 
how they worked in the different groups of 
colonies. 

We have tried thus to sum up briefly the 
general plan of the work and what we may call 
the individuality of each volume. For the out- 
ward dress of the books we have only praise. 
The volumes are excellently printed, and ser- 
viceably bound. A very few typographical 
errors have escaped the editor's watchful eye. 
We find in Volume I. the word ' Geschicte,' p. 
37, note, has lost an 'h'; while 'Wilhelmi' 
p. 291, note 1, has added a spurious *i.' In 
Volume IV. p. 83, line 2, 'or' should be 'to'; 
and on p. 332, 'Vestusta' should be 'Vetusta.' 
In Volume \., p. 3.53, ' F. E. Sharp ' might 
effectively hide the identity of ' F. E. Sparks/ 
which is the correct name. We must not omit 
commendation of the bibliographical matter 
appended to each volume. 

If we may be permitted a word of criticism 
of the series as a whole, we feel sure that, by 
serious students of history, ' The American 
Xation ' will be rated not as a whole, but vol- 
ume by volume according to the worth of each. 
Some will hardly be relied upon for reference; 
but volumes like that of Professor Bourne will 
take their place as standard works. For the 
general reader, if he is not deterred by the 
enormous amount of matter, by the separate 
authorship, and by the ga|>3 that to some extent 
defy ' linking,' the work will prove a mine of 
information interestingly told, well arranged, 
and attractively published. Yet even the gen- 
eral reader may be very willing to adopt as his 
final opinion these words of Professor Jameson, 
uttered several years ago: 

'Stretched upon the Procrustean bed of uniform 
requirements in respect to extensiveness and general 
method of treatment, the authors can present only 
those things which they have in common — abun- 
dant and correct information and acute historical 
criticism. Many of the finer qualities of the indi- 
vidual mind are apt to evaporate in the process, 
much of what is most valuable in individual views 
and conceptions of history will find no place for 
itself. No one who appreciates these will readily 
assent to the assertion in the prospectus to the 
"Narrative and Critical History" that, "when the 
superiority of the cooperative method is fully under- 
stood, the individual historian, if he ventures forth 
at all, will be read for entertainment rather than 
for profit. ' ' '

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



A Shakespearian Miscel,l,aky.* 

The late Charles Isaac Elton's volume en- 
titled ' William Shakespeare, 'his Family and 
Friends' consists of a series of disconnected 
and occasionally unfinished papers, ' evidently 
intended to be the nucleus of an exhaustive 
work upon Shakespeare/ collected after the 
death of the distinguished historian and anti- 
quary, and published under the editorial super- 
vision of Mr. A. Hamilton Thompson, with a 
memoir of the author by Mr. Andrew Lang. It 
includes chapters on ' Facts and Traditions 
relating to Shakespeare's Early Life ' ; the anti- 
quities of Stratford and its neighboring towns, 
of the road from Stratford to London in 
Shakespeare's time, and of London itself; on 
' Midland Agriculture and Natural History 
in Shakespeare's Plays ' ; on Shakespeare's 
family and descendants ; on ' Illustrations of 
Shakespeare in the Seventeenth Century ' from 
Howell's Letters, Ward's Diary, and Dowdall's 
and Aubre/s notes ; and on ' The Production 
of The Tempest,' containing disquisitions on 
Hunter's theories of the sources of the play, on 
the plays and pageantry connected with the 
marriages of the Earl of Essex and of the Prin- 
cess Elizabeth, and on the history of the Black- 
friars Theatre and its boy actors. 

The book is a mine of curious and valuable 
information. Much of it, to be sure, has al- 
ready found its way into annotated editions of 
the plays, but Mr. Elton gives not only his con- 
clusions on doubtful points, but the arguments 
that led to them, enriched with illustration 
drawn from the most out-of-the-way sources. 
Indeed, so much material is furnished, and the 
learned antiquary ranges so very far afield, that 
the drift of his argument is not seldom ob- 
scured. Occasionally, also, the process is out 
of all proportion to the result; for example, 
the author devotes a chapter of thirty-four 
pages to the history of the Blackfriars Theatre 
and the boy actors because ' The Tempest pos- 
sibly may have been produced at Blackfriars 
during the boys' tenancy of the theatre' 
(p. 479). One is far from complaining of the 
wealth of facts, however meagre the inference; 
only, the volimie is hardly one to be read con- 
secutively. The former criticism, however, that 
the argument is not always clear, seems im- 
portant, especially when we consider the legal 
training of the author. An example may be 
found in the discussion of the date of Shakes- 
peare's birth (pp. 22-25), which is neither 
clear nor cogent, partly, we venture to think, 
because of incorrect reasoning, and partly be-

cause of the awkward handling of material. 
A similar criticism applies, though in a less 
degree, to the argument for the regularity of 
the poet's marriage. Compared with Mr. Lee's 
discussion of the same subject (Life of Shakes- 
peare, pp. 18-24), it is far from convincing. 
''Time was very pressing,' Mr. Elton says 
(p. 35), in explanation of an unusual clause in 
the marriage-license; and again, though the 
absence of the bridegroom's father is a plain 
suggestion that the marriage was irregular, he 
asserts (p. 35) that 'one of the two friends 
would doubtless produce a letter or document 
bearing John Shakespeare's signature or at- 
tested mark.' These two statements obviously 
beg the question. Whatever the truth may be, 
could ironical Fate have played an unkinder 
trick on literary historians, or have offered a 
greater temptation to romantic biographers, 
than to send two William Shakespeares to the 
Registry of the Bishop of Worcester, on two 
successive days, to arrange a technically irregu- 
lar marriage with a lady named Anne? Mr. 
Elton appears to hold a brief, more or less, for 
the respectability of Shakespeare's character. 
The poaching story he scouts : about a hundred 
years after Shakespeare left Stratford for Lon- 
don, ' someone invented the story of his robbing 
a park. . . The park, in process of time, 
was identified with Oharlecot, and the owner 
with Sir Thomas Lucy' (p. 38). Nor does he 
seem convinced that Sir Thomas is referred to 
in the Merry Wives and in 2 Henry IV. On 
the contrary he devotes himself to proving 
(pp. 43-45) that ' Shakespeare showed a certain 
respect for the Lucys and such persons bearing 
their names as he met with in the English 
chronicles,' — for example, the Lady Lucy men- 
tioned in Richard III., 3.7.5, and the Sir Wil- 
liam Lucy of 1 Henry VI., Act. 4, Scenes 3, 4. 
Like all careful students of Shakespeare's biog- 
raphy, as distinguished from the Brandes 
school of romancers, he is in general not ' wise 
above that which is written.' We have become 
so familiarized with the Shakespeare legend 
that we are hardly awaxe, ujitil the facts are 
stated succinctly and without hypothetical em- 
bellishment, how very little we know of Shake- 
speare's life. It is somewhat startling, even to 
a professed student of Shakespeare, to read 
(p. 26) : * The Christian name of his wife 
and her age . . . are knovva only by the 
inscription on her tomb.' Yet, so insidious is 
the temptation to romance on this ever-fasci- 
nating topic, that Mr. Elton, somewhat to our 
amusement, writes (p. 38) : 'It may be as- 
sumed that the young couple lived with Mt. 
John Shakespeare, and that Anne Shakespeare 
helped in the housework, while her husband 
found something to do, either in teaching school

or copying papers in a lawyer's oflBce.' Again, 
he appears to be somewhat incautious in as- 
suming (p. 218) that the William Shakespeare 
who appealed against paying his share of the 
St. Helen's assessment in 1598 wps the poet. 
Mt. Lee, more careful, says (p. 38), 'it is not 
certain that this taxpayer was the dramatist.' 
The facts given by Mr. Elton himself would 
seem to render such a doubt reasonable, though 
probably the wealthy man's device of ' swearing- 
off taxes' was not discovered yesterday. In 
1598, the poet had recently bought New Place, 
he was a large owner of grain, he was in a posi- 
tion to be asked by Eichard Quiney for a loan 
of thirty pounds, and he was the author of at 
least eighteen successful plays. *If the diflB- 
culty can be explained at all,' says Mr. Elton 
(p. 219), 'it will probably be found that the 
poet had quite recently fallen into debt, lawful 
debt, which in truth and conscience he intended 
to pay'! In one interesting particular, the 
author corrects Mr. Lee's implication (p. 4) 
that John Shakespeare combined farming with 
the trades of butcher and glover. He savs 
(p. 319) : 

'People have talked of John Shakespeare's mul- 
tifarious pursuits, suggesting that he farmed in the 
common-field at Asbies, and made up the wool and 
butchered the stock at Stratford; but, in fact, the 
farm was under lease to a tenant, and he would 
never have been allowed in any case to join such 
incongruous trades as those of a butcher and a 
glover. He could not keep a regular meat -shop while 
trading in skins, and no one haa seriously suggested 
that he worked about as a slaughterman, though 
such people were classed among butchers. . . . 
The killing of calves was the subject of constant 
restrictions, and it is certain that the inspectors 
would put a stop to anything that might injure 
the veal; it is almost inconceivable, indeed, that 
a boy would be allowed to play such pranks in 
the shambles as the gossips described.' 

The last sentence is an amusing reference to 
Aubre}-'s statement that ' when he kill'd a calf e 
he would doe it in a high style, and make a 
speech.' Halliwell-Phillipps is probably the 
source of Mr. Lee's error, if error it is (Out- 
lines, I., p. 30, II., p. 339). .Now and then, on 
the other hand, the author is perhaps unduly 
cautious. It is generally known that on the 
identity of the names Agnes, Annes, and Anne 
in the sixteenth century, depends the validity 
of the inference that the Agnes of Eichard 
Hathaway's will was Shakespeare's wife, Anne. 
Mr. Elton's scepticism as to the identity of the 
names seems to us unwarranted. The will of 
Eobert Arden, which refers to his wife, Annes, 
and that of his widow, who calls herself Agnes, 
would almost be sufficient. The very fact, cited 
by Mr. Elton (p. 29), that early law had 
decreed the distinction of the names Anne and 
Agnes would seem to prove that they were popu- 



larly confused, and the examples given in Halli- 
weU-Phillipps' Outlines (II., p. 184) show 
conclusively that they actually were. The book, 
however, abounds in the best kind of biographi- 
cal material; for instance, the carefully docu- 
mented descriptions of the farmer's condition 
in the sixteenth century, the appalling duties 
of the women of his family, and the inventory 
of the household goods of Eobert Arden 
(pp. 114, 117, 121), all of which enable us, 
without baseless assumptions, to reproduce 
imaginatively the life of the day. 

Not only will the student of Shakespeare's 
biography find his account in these papers, but 
the student of the text as well. From the most 
remote quarters, light is shed on obscure or 
debated passages. Mr. Elton's researches into 
agricultural antiquities, for example (pp. 140- 
147), enable him to explain such technical 
words as ' land ' (Ven. and Adon., Ded.), ' head- 
land' (2 Hen. lY., 5.1.16), 'furlongs' 
(Temp., 1.1.68), 'several' (L. L. L., 2.1.223; 
Son., 137, 1.9), 'pioned and twilled' (Temp., 
4.1.64), words which Schmidt quite fails to 
explain with precision, and which the recently- 
published reprint of Dyce's Glossarj' does not 
even mention. In the interesting discussion of 
Shakespeare's accurate use of hunting terms 
(pp. 166-176), we are incidentally reminded, 
by a reference to All's Well, 3.6.111, that the 
verb of the maxim, ' First catch your hare,' 
should probably be 'case' (i. e., flay). In this 
connection it seems doubtful that 'fore- 
stalled ' (Haml., 3.3.49), and ' dislodged' (Cor., 
5.4.44), are used with any sense of their signifi- 
cance as hunting terms (p. 167). One may 
question, also, whether 'reels' (Haml., 1.4.9) 
is a verb (p. 283), and whether ' knocks up the 
curtain' (Span. Trag., 4.3, stage direction) is 
rightly understood (p. 460). We should have 
expected IMr. Elton to explain the interesting 
iiistor}' of ' nagares ' in the Arden inventory, 
but he merely adds, ' or augers, as they are prop- 
erly called' (p. 121). It is surely unnecessary 
(p!^ 119) to see in Lucrece, 11.1199-1205, a 
reference to the will of Eobert Arden because of 
the bequest of the soul to G-od and the body to 
the ground, and the use of the term 'oversee.' 
The wills of Agnes Arden, Eichard Hathaway 
of Shotter}', Bartholemew Hathaway, Eichard 
Hathaway of Warwick, and Shakespeare him- 
self all emplo}' the same terms. 

The great stores of information contained in 
the book are placed at the ready disposal of the 
reader by a full and, so far as we have exam- 
ined, accurate index. It is a work of the very 
greatest value to the student of Shakespeare.

The Railway Problem.* 



Xo other suhject more fully occupies the 
attention of the public today than the railway. 
Tliis great network, including in its meshes 
every community, and carrying to every dck)r its 
services, has not needed the criticism of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, or even the 
statements in a recent presidential message, to 
fix upon it an absorbing i>ublic interest. The 
aSTorthern Securities episode, begun on Wall 
Street and now continuing in the Federal 
courts, the spectacular performances in Rock 
Island of the Moore brothers, the recent absorp- 
tion one after another of great roads, until 
now some twenty great combinations control 
200,000 miles of line; the manipulation of the 
coal roads by the coal barons, the present con- 
troversy over private cars, the latest rate war 
between the trunk lines to the Atlantic coast 
and the grangers that serve the Gulf, — all 
these events are but a few of the phenomena 
of the railway world of today. 

A great change in public opinion as regards 
the railways has come about since the enact- 
ment of the contradictory Interstate Commerce 
Act in 1886, and especially since the imex- 
pected application of the Sherman Anti-Trust 
Act to the railroads by the Supreme Court in 
1897. The thinking public has come to see 
that, while the railroad business, like all other 
businesses, is ojien to the conduct of its affairs 
in antagonism to the best interests of the whole 
community, the race of railroad managers has 
grown with the growth of the country. It is 
no longer possible to find great wreckers in 
control of these semi-public services, and the 
railroad presidents of today are, in the main, 
the very cream of the business ability of the 
nation. Presidents Cassatt, Hughitt, Hill, and 
Fish are of the best, but they are representa- 
tive. These men handle their properties not 
merely for dividends. They recognize the 
solidarity of the business interests of "tlie whole 
country, and Mr. Hill, distinctively, has been 
the builder, not oiily of a road, but of a whole 
industrial empire in the ' new northwest.' 

If there is to be more state regulation, and 
that seems likely, in deference to a more

enlightened public opinion it will probably 
attempt not to shackle, but to direct. The 
older methods that threatened to ' kill the goose 
that laid the golden egg ' will not be repeated. 
Writers such as Professor Xewcomb have so 
clearly shown how the ton-mile rate has stead- 
ily declined to a mere fraction, that the charge 
of wholesale robbery cannot longer be gravely 
maintained. Discrimination, under the pressure 
of great sliippers, to whom the Standard Oil 
managers notably showed the way, is the evil 
of today. But it cannot be handled for abate- 
ment from the side solely of the railway, and 
Mr. Garfield's suggestion of federal incorpora- 
tion points the way to a possil)le solution. 

A happy sign of an improving pul)lic 
opinion in regard to control of these great 
public utilities is the appearance in the 
last two or three years of a literature 
devoted to the railway problem. The Dial 
had occasion a year ago to review several of 
the best of these volUmes. One of the latest 
contributions is from the hand of ]\Ir. Frank 
H. Spearman, who like his distinguished pro- 
totype Frank Xorris knows how to bring fiction 
to aid the cause of truth in this field of 
research. The author of ' The Daughter of a 
Magnate,' in his latest work, presents a series 
of industrial pictures of the Vanderbilt, the 
Pennsylvania, the Harriman, the Hill, the 
Gould, and the old ' granger ' lines, and also 
glances at Eock Island, Santa Fe, and Alton. 
He closes with an account of the building of 
the line from Omaha to San Francisco. He 
writes with a familiarity with his 'subject that 
enlightens, and with a style that entertains and 
fascinates. One can hardly say that he holds 
a brief for the railways, but he frequently puts 
the telescope to his blind eye — as when he 
says, speaking of Mr. C*assatt : 

'He determined that rate discrimination in the 
United States, the impoverishment of the investor, 
the ruin of the honest shipper, and the cause of 
so many railroad receiverships, should cease, and 
to the task of putting it down he and his associates 
addressed themselves; and after public prints and 
public speakers had shouted themselves hoarse; 
after congress had failed in solving the problem, as 
it has always failed; after the courts of the TTnited 
States had failed, as they have always failed, this 
railroad man and his associates took the abuse m 
hand and stamped it out of American railroading.' 

One can only deny the conclusion. But the 
magnificent business ability that has covered 
this land Avith roads of steel, has outfitted then! ■ 
with the most perfect railroad appliances in 
the world, and has not only squeezed out most 
of the water of earlier days, but has given, 
year by year, a cheaper service hand in hand 
with a better service, is given ample credit in 
the pages of this advocate. One cannot dwell

upon the palpable facts that are here recorded 
and wish for any legislation that shall arrest 
or discourage such splendid builders of our 
industrial, commercial, and political empire. 
One can only sigh and wish that the method of 
-railroading' might not be applied to one of 
the most important subjects before the people 
in the last days of an indolent Congress. He 
must wish rather that the more rational meth- 
ods of an English parliament might apply, and 
these important measures l)e prepared by a 
commission of wisdom and expert knowledge

Kecext American Poetry.* 

Many a time and oft has the poet essayed 
to ]nit into words the inexpressible soul of 
music. For the poet who is also a lover of 
music the temptation is wellnigh irresistible, 
for he cannot fail to recognize that the musi- 
cian's art is closely related to his own, and com- 
plements it in many subtle ways. If it be 
true, as Pater claims, that all art tends to 
approach the condition of music, and achieves 
a succ-ess measured by the degree in which it 
nears this ideal end, then it must seem to the 
poet more than to other artistic workers a mat- 
ter of urgency that he possess himself of the 
musician's secret and penetrate to the sources 
of the musician's inspiration. There are vari- 
ous ways of making music the theme of poetry ; 
the way most generally accessible is that of 
recording the emotions awakened by a musical 
jierformance. and pressing into the service such 
imagery and parallelisms as it suggests. This 
is tiie way of Mr. Henry van Dyke, in the ode

which opens his latest volume of verse. The 
following quotation illustrates the method of 
this writer: 

' Light to the eye and Music to the ear. — 
These are the builders of the bridge that springs 
From earths dim shore of half-remembered things 
To reach the spirits" home, the heavenly sphere 
Where nothing silent is and nothing dark. 

So when I see the rainbow's arc 
Spanning the showery sky, far-off I hear 

Music, and every colour sings : 
And while the symphony builds up its round 
Full sweep of architectural harmony 
Above the tide of Time, far, far away I see 
A bow of colour in the bow of sound.' 



nius far, the poetic imagination is put to 
strictlv legitimate uses, but we have some doubt 
concerning the legitimacy of the analysis that 
follows. 

' Red as the dawn the trumpet rings. 
Imperial purple from the trombone flows. 
The mellow horn melts into evening rose 

Blue as the sky, the choir of strings 
Darkens in double-bass to ocean's hue. 
Rises in violins to noon- tide's blue. 
With threads of quivering light shot through and 
through. 

This is a little too suggestive of the French- 
man's fantastical ascription of a definite color 
to each of the vowels. Analogies of this sort are 
too individually subjective to find any response 
in the common consciousness: and their valid- 
ity is consequently questionable. The remain- 
ing iK)ems in ^It. Van Dyke's volume take 
many forms and handle many themes. There 
are odes, sonnets, legends, lyrics, and bits of 
personal vei^e. They are delicate and graceful 
in workmanship, the expression of a refined and 
sensitive poetic instinct rather than the out- 
pourings of a creative mood. 

Several poems included in ' The Twin 
Immortalities,' by Mr. Charles E. Russell, 
attempt the interpretation of music in a far 
more intimate way than does the ode above 
mentioned. Three of these poems, devoted 
respectively to certain compositions by Yolk- 
mann. Eubinstein. and Beethoven, simply seek 
to find words for the train of feelings and fan- 
cies evoked by the music. The following, for 
example, from Volkmann's Serenade in D 
Minor, is very charming: 

' 'White silent depths of moonlight on whose breast 

The silvered trees 
Float like dim argosies at dreamy rest 

On stirless seas ; 
So still that when the moon sails high 
The song she sings in that vast sky 
Seems breathc?d afar on fairy flutes : 
So still that when her faint strains die 
Across the depths dim echoes fly 

Star-touched on throbbing lutes.' 

But it is not in verse of this sort, which 
manv others have done equally well, that Mr. 
Russell's deepest appreciation of music may be 
found. It is rather in the two compositions, 
' Graubiinden ' and ' Pegli,' actually written in 
the classical form of the sonata, that we find

music and poetry brought into the closest pos- 
sible relations. One naturally thinks, reading 
these poems, of ' Master Hughes of Saxe- 
Gotha/ land ' A Toccata of Galuppi's/ but it is 
chiefly to realize that Mr. Russell has attempted 
a more difficult task than Browning's, and with 
surprising success. Where Browning gives us 
a masterly technical description, our present 
author does not describe at all, but simply 
writes in conformity with the severe rule of the 
composer. Taking ' Graubiinden ' for examina- 
tion, we find, first of all, that it is a poem in 
the orthodox four movements. Taking the 
second of these movements, the adagio, Mr. 
Eussell's own words may be quoted by way of 
exposition. ' The first stanza announces the 
first theme. Then follows a development group 
of four stanzas leading to the episode in stanza 
four. The first theme is repeated in stanza 
five, and the next development group leads to 
the second theme in stanza ten. The material 
of the second theme — Force and Time — is 
then worked out to the eighteenth stanza, when 
there is a recapitulation of the first theme and 
a stanza as a coda.' So much for the form of 
this poem ; its subject is provided by the heroic 
and successful struggle for freedom of the Grau- 
bundners in the fifteenth century. We can 
quote but briefly, not at a length sufficient to 
show how admirably the musical form is imi- 
tated, but sufficient to make it clear that the 
poetry does not suffer from having been writ- 
ten under these exacting conditions. Here is 
the first theme: 

' Winds that waft the dead sprays in and out, 
Winds before whose breath the faint stars shiver, 

Coldly glimpsed through wild clouds blown about, 
Now when leaves float brown upon the river. 
Shorn and shot by bolts from out thy quiver. 

Tell me in what dust thy wrath has blown 
Up and down the weary earth forever 

Any name or fame of theirs is known.' 

Here is a stanza taken from the working-out of 
the second theme : 

' Even she, our lady, in whose name 

Faith takes heart again, and, starward turning, 
Hope in sweetest eyes casts back the flame 

Ever in her torch uplifted burning. 

She to whom men, turn with that old yearning, 
Sun and star and goddess. Liberty, 

Beautiful beyond all lore or learning, 
Sweet as sunrise on the heaving sea.' 

And here we have the recapitulation of the first 
theme with the coda : 

' Wind that blows the cloud-flags far about, 

Wind that makes the huge storm-trumpets shiver, 

Wind before whose stern triumphant shout 
Men are bowed in awe and mountains quiver. 
Give us one great strain of sea or river. 

Fit to sing their praise whose deeds are known. 
Round and round the radiant world forever. 

Grandest strain of all thy lips have blown. 

' Mother Earth, that seest all sons of thine. 
Wind thy tender arms about them sleeping ; 

Cover them with roses and wild vine 

Where the river in slow circles sweeping 



Sings a quiet song for their safe-keeping. 
Bend, O mother, with thy smile above them, 

Peace in thy mild eyes and with no weeping ; 
Thou and we have one great cause to love them.' 

But we must not give the impression that Mr, 
Russell stands for experimental expression 
merely, or that aesthetic considerations alone are 
raised by his verse. He has a very definite 
social creed, which all his art is bent to enforce. 
It is the creed of democracy, not in the sense 
of a political shibboleth, but in that of the 
brotherhood of man, which his book maintains 
from first to last. His work is dedicated to 
President Loubet, the 'foremost democrat of 
these times,' and the passion of that faith finds 
exalted expression in such poems as 'Adam's 
Sons ' and the ' Coronation Ode.' We must 
quote from both of these poems, choosing in 
each case the final stanza. This is the ending 
of 'Adam's Sons': 

' We have one goal together, you and I : 
We hear one echo of a wailing cry 

Incessant raised by sundered soul from soul 
Left lonely here as we ; 

And if a land beyond the clouds that roll 
Or only sleep and dreamless rest there be 

We know not, O my brother ! but the dark 

Lightens a little with this only spark 
That with clasped hands and hearts we go as one 

When through the dusk we hear the dim bell toll 
The day is done.' 

And this is the close of the ' Coronation Ode ' : 

' No more of Kings : this is the age of man ! 
For you the night is dark, the day means naught ; 
Wasted for you your heroes' blood that ran 
And lost the labor of their hands that wrought. 
The world goes on and leaves you on your knees 
Mumbling and mouthing to such gauds as these. 
The marchers' chorus swells ; 
You hear no hint of all it tells. 
Voice after voice the burden sings 
sturdy and strong : 
We tread the wrecks of sceptre and of throne. 
Our feet crush out old faiths of fraud and wrong, 
We have no crown but liberty alone — 

Labor and love are Kings!' 

It is difficult to end the pleasant task of illus- 
trating this rich and varied volume of verse. 
One more extract, at least, shall be given, a 
stanza from the poet's beautiful tribute to the 
artist of ' La Bella Simonetta.' 

' Shall not men's mightiest as their lightest deeds 
Be sown beyond us in Time's field for seeds, 

And every word or work be rooted there 
To make earth red with roses, waste with weeds? 

What man has died then? Ah, all earth and air 
Are roseate as with shadow of a flame 

For him ; the fields are bright with leaf and bloom 

Sprung from his time of sorrow and grey gloom. 
And men that see the flowerage of his fame 

Twine chaplets wet with tears tKat keep them fair 
Round Botticelli's name.' 

This conception of immortality recurs again 
and again in Mr. Russell's work, and is the 
keynote of the titular poem. We hardly 
need the actual tribute paid to the greatest 
poet now living in the world to remind us that 
the influence of Mr. Swinburne is manifest 
upon many pages.

Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles, in one of 
the pieces \rhich he has collected into a volume 
entitled *Love Triumphant/ makes a demand 
for 

' None of the old tunes, poet !' 

It cannot be said that Mr. Knowles has hark- 
ened to his own precept, for he gives ns many 
of the old tunes, as well as eclectic echoes of 
many of the old ideas. At one time it is Keats, 
at another Arnold, at still another Christina 
Bossetti, but what is your poor poet to do when 
all the forms and the thoughts have been 
pressed into service by those who have gone 
before? The titular poem in this volume will 
give a very fair idea of Mr. Knowles's graceful 
workmanship. 

'Helen's lips are drifting dust; 

Ilion is consumed with rust ; 

All the galleons of Greece 

Drink the ocean's dreamless peace ; 

Lost was Solomon's purple show 

Restless centuries ago ; 

stately empires wax and wane — 

Babylon, Barbary and Spain ; — 

Only one thing, undefaced. 

Lasts, though all the worlds lie waste 

And the heavens are overturned. 

— Dear, how long ago we learned ! 

' There's a sight that blinds the sun, 
Sound that lives when sounds are done. 
Music that rebukes the birds. 
Language lovelier than words. 
Hue and scent that shame the rose. 
Wine no earthly vineyard knows. 
Silence stiller than the shore 
Swept by Charon's stealthy oar. 
Ocean more divinely free 
Than Pacific's boundless sea, — 
Ye who love have learn'd It true. 
— Dear, how long ago we knew !' 

During his brief life, Guy Wetmore Carry! 
was chiefly known to readers at large as a 
writer of trifles in verse and prose, and it is 
only since his lamented death that his more 
serious qualities have been fully revealed. The 
posthumous collection of his verse, entitled 
•' The Garden of Years and Other Poems,' is in 
spirit far indeed removed from his * Grimm 
Tales Miade Gay,' and his ' Fables for the 
Fxivolous.' It is a volume of manly sentiment 
embodied in facile and vigorous measures. The 
long poem which supplies the title is a con- 
fession of love in many stanzas, combined with 
reminiscenc-es of his Wanderjahre. We quote a 
specimen stanza. 

• 'Twas in the garden, phantom-trod, of those 
My younger years, when life before me lay. 

That first I saw the flower of Love unclose 

From fancy's folded bud. Youth only knows 
How tenderly I longed to pluck it ! Xay, 
I would not waken those dead hours to-day : 

For Time's consuming fire, with lambent lip. 
Has kissed my fair frail flower, and so I may 

Xot touch with the most careful finger-tip 
Its ashes, perfect as the unbumt rose. 

Xext in importance to this long poem is the 
group of five patriotic ballads which follow it, 
ballads written in a long and swinging rh}-thm. 



which may be illustrated by the following lines : 

' The faithful unto death, their sleeping-places over 
The torn and trampled clover to braver beauty blows ; 

Of all their grim campaigning no sight nor sound remain- 
ing. 
The memory of them mutely to greater glory grews.' 

This volume is peculiarly fortunate in having 
an introduction by Mr. E. C. Stedman, who 
in a few felicitous words pays both personal 
and critical tribute to the author's memory. 

'Lyrics and Legends of Christmas-Tide' is 
the latest of the little books of verse that Mr. 
Clinton Scollard puts forth from time to time 
in limited editions. There are something like 
thirty songs in this collection, unpretentiously 
charming, and filled with the spirit of the sea- 
son they celebrate. Our quotation shall be one 
of the four stanzas on *Xazareth Town.' 

' Xazareth town in Galilee ! 

Strumming a desert melody. 

The Bedouin minstrel trolls in the street ; 

At the Well of the Virgins the maidens meet; 

The cactus-hedges crimson to flower. 

And the olives silver hour by hour 

As through the branches the south wind steals, 

A clear bell peals, and a vulture wheels 

Over the crest where the wild crags be ; — 

Xazareth town in Galilee !' 

The small volume which contains Mr. Frank 
Dempster Sherman's ' Lyrics of Joy ' may be 
fairly represented by the exquisite poem called 
* Winter Dreams.' 

' Deep lies the snow on wood and field ; 

Gray stretches overhead the sky ; 
The streams, their lips of laughter sealed. 

In silence wander slowly by. 

' Earth slumbers, and her dreams, — who knows 
But they may sometimes be like ours? 

Lyrics of spring in winter's prose 

Tliat sing of buds and leaves and flowers ; 

' Dreams of that day when from the South 

Comes April, as at flrst she came. 
To hold the bare twig to her mouth 

And blow it into fragrant flame.' 

Long practice has given Mr. Sherman a highly- 
finished technique, and the pieces in this col- 
lection have the art of true simplicity, or the 
simplicity of true art — ^the phrase fits which- 
ever way it is taken. 

Somewhat weightier in matter than the 
poems in the two collections just mentioned^ — 
or at least more elaborate in plan — are the 
' Interludes' of Mr. Philip Becker Goetz. These 
poems are written in blank verse which is some- 
what lacking in lyrical quality, but has vigor 
and a tang that gives zest to the taste. 
' Astray ' is possibly not so characteristic a 
specimen as might have been chosen, but it is 
the appealing embodiment of a thought that 
must often arise in serious minds. 

' I marvel not that sadder grows the world. 
For men have lost the love of simple things. 
With eloquence of Nature's music mute. 
With speed of waterways made bond to trade. 
With stately trees brought low for needless heaps.

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



With flowers forced untimely into bloom, — 

What is there honest, free, and fair remaining? 

We stifle in our towns of prisoned air 

And happy with a rare glance from the earth 

We see a square of blue or curdled cloud, 

Or niggard stretch of moonlight through a street. 

At manners of the hill-bound kind we scoff. 

Although we know not what those hills have taught 

Of dumb and deep contempt for city's towers. 

And in these keeps of pain, disease, and sin. 

These wards of grief whose keys are our own eyes, 

With blanched regard we tell ourselves we live. 

O mother of us all, from whom we went 

As early as our tender steps were free. 

Whose near outstretch of arm we put aside 

To hurry from thy verdant aisles of peace, 

Take us again, us sick with thought or craft. 

And lull us with thy choirs of careless birds ; 

And if there be more tragedy beneath 

The swell of thy serene, sweet mother breasts. 

Preserve thy silence and thy smile of old, 

Make merry with thy children as we glance. 

Let perfume charm and wonder awe once more 

As, leaning to thy heart our tired desires. 

We feel the oblivious beat of speechless love.' 

This may be called belated Wordsworthianism, 
but the message is even more insistent now 
than it was a century ago. Besides the ' Inter- 
ludes/ of which one has been quoted, Mr. 
Goetz's little volume contains ballads, songs, 
and sonnets, many of them striking in phrase 
and musical in measure. We cannot refrain 
from quoting the sonnet on Virgil. 

' A mere pale boy, who, watching docile sheep 

On mead and easy upland o'er and o'er, 

Wove many songs with young Sicilian lore 

The while his spirit with increasing sweep 

Longed to be where seven hills in starry sleep 

Saw done the dauntless deeds, saw spent the gore. 

Saw drop the vanward bird and sink who bore. 

Until one master stemmed the battle's heap 

And reigned a prince of peace, — the high renown 

That mother-city of all cities born 

To celebrate and rumor through all time 

With the grand pathos of her bright, dead prime 

Was that pale boy's, whose very glories mourn 

As if they knew immortal rides no crown.' 

There can be no doubt that this is poetry, and 
of unusual distinction. The author sometimes 
strains a little for effect, but the average qual- 
ity of his work is singularly high. 

Mr. Eobert Loveman's new volumis is his 
fourth, and, like the other three, is made up 
of brief and simple lyrics. These rhymes upon 
'Abelard and Heloise ' have particularly taken 
our fancy : 

' Abelard and Heloise, 
Ne'er were lovers like to these ; 
Flying in the face of fate. 
Ground beneath the heel of hate 
Constant to the latest breath. 
With a faith defying death. 
Deeper than unsounded seas, — 
Abelard and Heloise. 

' Abelard and Heloise, 
Drained Love's chalice to the lees ; 
Joyed and sorrowed, laughed and wept. 
Tempest-torn and passion-swept ; 
Now they dream away the days 
In the peaceful Pere-la-Chaise, 
Sleeping there beneath the trees, — 
Abelard and Heloise.' 

Few poets can say as much as Mr. Loveman 
can within the compass of a pair of stanzas. 



A book of sincere and unaffected expression, 
having childhood, religion, and nature for its 
themes, is put forth by Mrs. Mary Thacher 
Higginson, and entitled "' The Playmate Hours.' 
We select ' The Strength of the Hills' for one 
of our illustrations. 

' A midnight hush pervades the air. 
No birdling chirps, no leaflet stirs; 

Midsummer heat is everywhere, 
Even among the firs. 

'What far-off sound grows on the ear? 

Through wild ravines it sweeps along. 
As if some swift-winged bird drew near 

To wake the night with song. 

' A rustle fills the birches tall ; 

A sudden coolness fans the cheek : 
Monadnock's breath bears life to all 

Beneath its rugged peak. 

' For here each day is born anew 

A chaste Diana, fresh and fair. 
Whose arrows, dipped in forest dew, 

Transfix each worldly care.' 

Our other illustration shall be this fine sonnet 
called ' Ghost-Flowers,' by which is meant the 
Monotropa, or Indian pipe : 

' In shining groups, each stem a pearly ray. 

Weird flecks of light within the shadowed wood. 

They dwell aloof, a spotless sisterhood. 

No Angelus, except the wild bird's lay, 
Awakes these forest nuns ; yet night and day 

Their heads are bent, as if in prayerful mood. 

A touch will mar their snow, and tempests rude 

Deflle ; but in the mist fresh blossoms stray 
From spirit-gardens just beyond our ken. 

Each year we seek their virgin hauuts to look 

Upon new loveliness, and watch again 
Their shy devotions near the singing brook ; 

Then, mingling in the dizzy stir of man. 

Forget the vows made in that cloistered nook.' 

Tliere are not many of these poems, and the 
writing of what few there are has been scat- 
tered over many years. At their best, as has 
been shown, they are exquisite in feeling and 
finish, and none of them falls far short of this 
best. 

' ]\Iine and Thine,' by Mrs. Florence Earle 
Coates, is a volume made up chiefly of occa- 
sional verse, if we extend that term to include 
personal tributes and pieces called forth by 
some incidental impression. Thus, the author 
pays her resi>ects to Mr. Stedman, Mr. Yeats, 
Madame Bernhardt, and Helen Keller, among 
the living, and to Beethoven, Picquart, Whist- 
ler, E. N". Westcott, Stevenson, Millet, and 
Joan of Arc, among the dead. She also 
inscril>es verses to England, Paris, and Buffalo, 
and to the ' War for the Liberation of Cuba.' 
Her sonnet ' To William Butler Yeats ' seems 
to us to represent her work uix)n its highest 
level. 

' Tell us of beauty ! Touch thy silver lyre 
And bid thy Muse unfold her shining wings ! 
Tell us of joy — of those unaging things 

Which wither not, nor are consumed by fire. 

Things unto which the souls of all aspire ! 
Sing us the mystic song thine Erin sings, 
Her poignant dreams, her weird imaginings. 

With magic of thy "Land of Heart's Desire! "

' Let others hate I — from lips not thine be hurled 
Reproaches ; since all hate at last miist prove 

Abortive, though it triumph for a while. 
The gospels that indeed have won the world 
Laid their foundation on the strength of love. 

Sing thou, a lover, of thy wave-washed Isle !' 

Of the excellence of Mrs. Coates's senti- 
ments there can be no doubt; her nature is 
warmly responsive to whatever is worthy in 
life or beautiful in art. But her expression 
does not often exhibit spontaneity or achieve 
distinction. 

Spontaneity has never been a marked char- 
acteristic of the verse of Miss Edith M. 
Thomas, who is too reflective a singer for the 
higher sort of lyrical utterance, but there are 
touches of distinction upon nearly even-thing 
she writes. Plainness of speech and subtlety 
of thought mark her work, and make it very 
precious to lovers of the graver kind of verse. 
This writer has been silent for so long that her 
new volume, ' Cassia, and Other Yerse/ is 
doubly welc-ome. Here is a typical selection, 
called ' A Peu Pres ' : 

' Thy palace walls were founded well. 

And well its courses thou didst lay ; 
One tower defied the genie's spell 

And stands a ruin to this day. 

' The land of flowers thou didst attain. 

And see the spring's immortal jet ; 
Thy staff-worn hand was reached in vain — 

Thy lips that crystal never wet ! 

' With pains the altar thou didst dress. 

And the burnt sacrifice prepare, 
And call upon the God to bless — 

All but the fire from Heaven was there I 

* Thou shak'st thy lance on hard-fought field, 
Thou sleep'st, the tingling stars above ; — 

Pity and praise sweet eyes can yield. 

But ne'er vouchsafe the Light of Love ! ' 

"What dost thou lack? 'Tis almost naught 
That parts thee from thy Heart's Desire, — 

A step — a span — an airy thought : 
A pulse-beat more, thou didst require !' 

Miss Thomas's gift for moralizing impressively 
but not obstrusively upon a single theme is well 
illustrated by this poem. That she has the 
right feeling about poetic opportunity is shown 
by such lines as these: 

' Thine the fault. 
If nothing near thee moves thy breast to song : 
Thy mornings are new-lit, thine evenings starred. 
Thy wind-blown forests are with joy exalt, 
Thy threshold birds are singing all day long — 
Not thou dost lack a Theme, but these a Bard.' 

This volume includes upwards of two score 
sonnets, most of which are of richly imagina- 
tive beauty. It is with much hesitation that 
we have chosen ' From Lips of Stone' to stand 
for the entire group. 

' Amid a waste and solitary field. 
Upon the twilight boundary of the day, 
Upspake the timeless flintstone huge and gray : 
" WTiy should my counsel be forever sealed 7 
To thee an ancient truth shall be revealed — 
To thee, a wavering mortal, brief of stay : — 
Something of kin, — thou piece of passioned clay. 
Art thou and I, whom passion ne'er did wield ; 



For, lo ! did not Deucalion at the flood 
Behind him fling us stones — and men we grew? 
With limbs we moved abroad, with lips we spake ! 
And hast not thou, with grief, seen flesh-and-blood 
Become to thee as stones, that Pity's dew 
Could never melt, nor yet thine anger break? " ' 

From Miss Hildegarde Hawthorne's little 
volume of delicate * Poems ' we select ' A Song * 
for our example. 

' Sing me a sweet, low song of night 
Before the moon is risen, 

A song that tells of the stars' delight 
Escaped from day's bright prison ; 

A song that croons with the cricket's voice- 
That sleeps with the shadowed trees, 

A song that shall bid my heart rejoice 
At its tender mysteries ! 

' And then when the song is ended, love. 

Bend down your head unto me ; 
Whisper the word that was bom above 

Ere the moon bad swayed the sea; 
Ere the brightest stars began to shine 

Or the farthest sun to bum. 
The oldest of words, O heart of mine. 

Yet newest, and sweet to learn !' 

We could hardly wish for a prettier close fo' 
the series of extracts which have been strung 
together in this review.

India in Geographically, India is a conti- 

its physical nent, a little less than half as 

"*''*'■"• large as Europe, but characterized 

by the same symmetry and proportions, the same 
rich variety of phj-sical features and climate, 
as Europe. It is more populous than Europe, 
having more than one hundred and forty inhab- 
itants to the square mile, while Europe has less 
than one hundred. And though usually spoken 
of as a political entity, it is a conglomeration of 
distinct kingdoms and peoples, and the concrete 
term 'Indian* may be applied to what is in the 
abstract a heterogeneous, polyglot combination 
of individuals, who belong to a dozen different 
nationalities, speak a Babel of tongues, and live 
in a variety of countries the physical features of 
which differ as much as their climatic conditions. 
Its ethnography must take note of peoples of 
Aryan, Scythian, Arab, Tartar, Dravidian, and 
Mongolian stocks, speaking more than seventy 
different langua^ges. Its geographical history be- 
gan with the invasion by Alexander the Great 
about the year 327 B. C.,— the first scientifically- 
conducted military expedition in the world's his- 
tory. Though for more than a century Eng- 
land has held the dominant position in this vast 
territory-, and official rep>orts to the British gov- 
ernment abound in information respecting its 
political and economic geography, j-et a compre- 
hensive geography of the country was much to 
be desired. Wise choice was made of Col. Sir 
Thomas Hungerford Holdich, K.C.I.E., C.P.,

veys, to supply this desideratum for 'Appletons'

will rank high with the other volumes of the 
series. Five chapters are devoted to the physical 
features of the various regions that compose the 
vast continent. A chapter on the people of 
India takes due account of the religions upon 
which the main divisions of the inhabitants are 
based. It is not sui'prising that the author, who 
has been engaged in the British public service in 
India for more than twenty years, should give 
his chief attention to economic geography in 
chapters on Agriculture and Revenue, on Min- 
erals, and on Climate. And inasmuch as twenty- 
five thousand miles of railway have been built in 
India since 1870, and as these railways are the 
most crowded with passenger traffic of any in 
the world, it is well that we should have a chap- 
ter on Railways. So great is the position that 
India now occupies in the world 's affairs that the 
appearance of such a book as this is especially 
opportune.

"Mall Magazine,' dealing with certain regions in 
-connection with their literary associations, are 
fnow collectively published under the title 'Liter- 
iary Geography' (imported by Charles Scribner's 
:Sons). Of the topographical literature now so 
tmuch in vogue, this book is one of the best exam- 
iples. It is full of interesting matter, is well writ- 
\ten, and the authors selected for description 
(mostly novelists) ai'e those about whom every- 
one likes to know; the illustrations, often made 
from special photographs, are numerous and un- 
commonly beautiful. The ' country ' of an author 
may mean either where he has spent his time 
and which he has commemorated in his writings, 
or it may mean the lands or regions brought 
under the sway of his imagination, as Provence 
and Palestine by Scott in 'Quentin Durward' and 
"^The Talisman,' as Samoa or Silverado or Fon- 
tainebleau in the instance of Stevenson ; or it 
may mean the actual country of birth and up- 
'bringing and residence. Sometimes these coincide, 
as in the instance of George Eliot, whose own 
<!0untry and whose most enduring country of the 
imagination are practically identical. In gen- 
eral, what our author means by the 'country' of 
a great writer, like Scott or Carlyle or the Bron- 
tes, is that region where life fii"st unfolded and 
where its roots are,— the countrj^ that the heart 
enshrines. These are the things of which one is 
always eager to hear, hoping, although well know- 
ing how vain the hope, to find some clue to that 
mysterious and incommunicable secret which we 
cjdl genius. 

The story of To tell 'The Story of Art 

Art through throughout the Ages' in three 

theages. hundred pages, at the same time 

yielding space for an average of two illustrations 
on each page, would seem to imply treatment of 
the most superficial kind. Beginning with the 
crude attempts at art in the quaternary period, 
continuing through Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, 
<jreece, Rome, and the modern European and 
American states, the space would seem to be 



barely adequate for mere statistics. But the 
scholarship and brilliancy of M. S. Reinach, 
member of the Institute of France, have achieved 
the apparently impossible and produced a book 
both critical and fascinating. This is partly be- 
cause Monsieur Reinach is such a master of the 
phrase; he condenses into a sentence an analysis 
or a criticism which others would spread through 
pages. How admirably, for example, is the char- 
acterization of Andrea del Sarto the technician, 
—'commonplace as a thinker, great as a paint- 
er'; and this, in speaking of Millet and our 
nineteenth-centuiy spirit,— 'The tender and fra- 
ternal sentiment that breathes from Millet's can- 
vases reveals that sympathy with the poor and 
humble which has been the honor and the tor- 
ment of the nineteenth century.' Impressionism 
is defined as a 'pictorial stenography, disdainful 
of details which rapid and sympathetic vision 
cannot seize.' Whoever wishes to pursue the 
subjects into their details will find at the end 
of each chapter an exhaustive bibliography, mak- 
ing the work especially desirable as a reference 
book covering the whole field of artistic expres- 
sion. The translation, by Miss Florence Sim- 
monds, is admirably done; and the volume is 
imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 



A study in It is from somewhat of a novel 
the principles view-point that Mr. William De- 
of personality. ^-^^ jj^^j^ ^^.^^^g certain phases of 

Greek philosophy and Cliristianity in his latest 
work, 'From Epicurus to Christ' (Macmillan). 
He takes, as a point of departure, such elements 
of personality as rise above the threshold of 
consciousness and are reducible to philosophical 
principles. It is with a view to discovering and 
pointing out these elements that he consults the 
doctrines of Epienrus, of the Stoics, of Plato, oE 
Aristotle, and lastly of Christ. His method is 
to quote, or to state simply in his own words, the 
gist of each master's teaching, then to comment 
upon it and show whei'ein lies its truth or its 
error. The study may be said to be in the form 
of an evolution — the best of the earlier systems 
being faithfully retained to aggrandize, as it 
were, the highest expression of personality, Christ. 
The Christian view of life, combined with the 
elements of truth in the earlier systems, Mr. 
Hyde regards as a really Catholic Christianity 
for which the present time is ripe. Although the 
author does not explicitly state the fact, the 
i-eader is left Avith the impression that such a 
religion is ultimate. An extremely interesting 
presentation of old principles in a new setting, 
together Avith keen suggestions of their modern 
exponents, tend to convmce the reader that Mr. 
Hyde himself is far from lacking in certain prin- 
ciples of personality.

is fairly authentic history, and every endeavor 
Jias been made to set down the facts without fear 
or favor. , The four greater episodes in the book 
are the massacre at Fort Phil Kearney, Colonel 
Forsyth's fight on the Arikaree (Beecher's 
Island), General Miles 's winter campaign against 
the Sioux, and the Custer massacre (the battle 
of the Little Big Horn). Such events as these, 
when coupled with knowledge of the provocation 
given the Indians by Americans in no way re- 
sponsible to the military-, who nes'ertheless have 
had to bear the burden of the misdeeds of others, 
cannot fail to interest all who admire splendid 
courage, marked resourcefulness, and everything 
that goes to make up the accomplished soldier. 
Mr. Brady has not }>een satisfied with the official 
and other reports of the time, but as far as pos- 
sible has supplemented them with such additional 
knowledge as he has been able to extract from 
those having direct relation with the events set 
forth. His anxiety, for example, to set straight 
the question as to whether or not General Cus- 
ter disobeyed orders in advancing upon the Sioux, 
and so bringing himself and his command to 
dreadful death, has resulted in a voluminous 
correspondence which requires an apj)endix and 
yet leaves the question not fully settled. Mr. 
Brady himself, however, seems to hold that there 
was no technical disobedience. The book is illus- 
trated by many pencils, some of them in the 
hands of artists of distinction; the effect as a 
whole is somewhat heterogenous, effective as 
each picture is, taken by itself. 



The marvels Probably no single volume yet

mdusti-y. ^^^ advances made in recent years 

in all the various fields of practical himian en- 
deavor as Mr. Charles H. Cochrane 's 'Modem 
Industrial Progress' (Lippincott). Abundantly 
and pertinently illustrated, it takes up in suc- 
cession no fewer than forty-two major and a 
number of minor topics. The chief interest obvi- 
ously lies in the directions of electricity and 
steel, but there are various other advances made 
possible by reason of these, such as the excava- 
tion of great canals through enormous and com- 
plicated mechanisms built of steel, and rapid 
vehicles made possible through electricity. The 
towering buildings which lend a Babel-like effect 
to our cities, the great ordnance carried by our 
leviathans upon the seas, flying machines already 
past the stage of experiment, the mechanisms 
that lend themselves to stage use and deceptions, 
machine-making, and the differences between the 
American method with uniform and interchange- 
able parts and the Europ>€an idea of building to 
suit special occasions and needs, all the appar- 
atus that takes standing grain from the field 
and ends with it in barrels of flour, glass-mak- 
ing, paper and its new uses, boot and shoe man- 
ufactures, weaving and spinning in power looms, 
clay and its newer uses, — these and scores of 
other topics here find exemplification and com- 
prehensive no less than succinct treatment. The 
book is well written, with directness and sim- 
plicity of style. 



New facta An important contribution to our 

concerning knowledge of the ways of volca- 

^^^^ Peiee. jj(jgg jg made by Mr. Angelo Heil- 

,prin, F.R.G.S., in his latest work, 'The Tower 
of Pelee: New Studies of the Great Volcano of 
Martinique' (Lippincott). It is the result of a 
series of visits to the island, during which a 
number of photographs were taken, and these 
photographs, with comment upon them, constitute 
the present thin quarto. While more than oup 
phase of the activities of Pielee is taken into ac- 
count, the book deals chiefly with the wonderful 
tower, believed to be the solidified core remaining 
in the vent of a prehistoric crater, which came 
first into view during the great eruption of 1902, 
and was destroyed in the cataclysm of August 
in that year. It began to emerge anew soon 
after, growing in height for days together at the 
rate of seventy feet a day, but crumbling at its 
top as it arose owing to fissures which served for 
the transmission of explosive vapors. It attained 
a maximum height of 800 feet or more, and was 
supported by a general rise of a supporting base 
of even greater elevation, the point of the tower 
reaching an altitude of 5,200 feet above sea level. 
The tower disapp)eared more rapidly than it 
came, and now remains only in the photographs, 
of extraordinary fidelity and impressiveness, that 
were taken of it. The book is written with more 
care than preceding volumes from the same hand, 
and will be read with intense interest. 



A year-book 'Saints and Festivals of the Chris- 
forthetthoie tian Church' (Stokes), by Mr. H. 
c/insf tan Church pomgroy Brewster, is an unusually 
terse and at the same time comprehensive church 
year-book, in which is told the origin, history, and 
present status of each of the chief festivals of 
the entire church, as well as of many local feasts 
and festivals which obtain in certain parts of 
Europe. The greatest merits of the work are its 
entire freedom from denominational bias, and 
the wide knowledge which it shows of profane 
a.nd ecclesiastical history and canon law. The 
record begins with Advent Sunday, and proceeds 
through the year, giving the date, fixed or approx- 
imate, for each festival, and finding some fes- 
tival for every day. It is of course impossible, 
even within the limits of five hundred closely- 
printed pages, to tell the stoiy of all the canon- 
ized saints of the church, so a few of the most 
noted have been chosen for each day, and their 
lives briefly sketched. An alphabetical index 
grives a much more compreliensive list of saints, 
with the proper 'saint-day' for each, and there 
is also a chronological list of all the Bishops and 
Popes since the death of St. Peter, and a copious 
general index. The book is copiously illustrated 
with a number of small cuts showing pictures of 
the saiiits or of the quaint symbols that the old 
church calendars employed to represent them. 

An aid to the Prof essor Jiilicher 's ' Introduction 
study of the to the New Testament,' in the 
New Testament, original German, has for ten 
years been familiar to New Testament students, 
and has gained a high place among such works.

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



Putnam's Sons, made from the second (the 
so-eaJIed 'third and fourth') German edition of 
1901, it will reach and benefit a much wider cir- 
cle, and New Testament study will be the 
gainer thereby. The translation exhibits, in the 
main, the ease and fidelity and clearness that 
are indispensable in such work. More attention 
to finish would have relieved the pages of some 
German survivals, such as Muratorianum, Sozo- 
menos, Theodoretus, Elzevier, and Leit-motiv. 
Memphian (for Memphitic), Pergamus (for 
Pergamum), Nizan (for Nisan, passim ) , are not 
improvements; and we should not have called a 
water-plant like papyrus a 'shrub' (p. 568). It 
is amusing to see 'Tendenz' soberly exhibited in 
parentheses after every clause in which the Ger- 
man has it; clearly it is with some still an 
object of worship. A paa-enthesis misplaced 
(p. 613) has thrown a series of valuable notes 
into confusion; and Mr. Gwilliam of Oxford is 
hardly recognizable in G. William (ibid). Cer- 
tain Greek spellings and certain English capi- 
talizations offend the reviewer's eye; but with 
all its fallibility this English form of Jiilicher's 
work will be useful and welcome. 



The history of A half Century ago there ap- 
a Southern peared 'A History of Maryland' 

commo7iweaith. Y>y James McSherry. It presented 
a fairly adequate description of the founding 
of the colony, of the Puritan conquest, and of the 
Revolutionary War, from the Roman Catholic 
point of view — although not radically so. This 
work has now been revised and supplemiented 
by Prof. Bartlett Burleigh James, of the West- 
em Maryland College, and is published by the 
Baltimore Book Co. The reviser has restrained 
the fulsomeness of McSherry, and has completed 
the story of Maryland from the close of the Rev- 
olution to the end of the nineteenth century. 
The Civil War is presented from an unbiased 
view, as is the Reconstruction period following. 
A few incorrect spellings,— such as Charles 
'Thompson,' Secretary of the Continental Con- 
gress, and the ease of 'Sprigg' instead of Prigg 
vs. Pennsylvania, — are to be noted. The polit- 
ical history has not been allowed to crowd out 
the industrial and economic development of the 
state, and the work as now presented is a val- 
uable addition to the rather scanty material 
available for Maryland's history. 



The quest of Mr. Dwight M. Huntington's man- 
' big game' ner in 'Our Big Game, a Book for 

inAmertca. Sportsmen and Nature-Lovers,' 
(Scribner) can best be described as intimate, 
leaving a feeling of good-fellowship and cam- 
araderie as a characteristic among those who go 
a-shooting. The animals discussed are those 
specified as 'big game' by the Boone and Crock- 
ett Club, and include wapiti, moose, mule-deer, 
black- tail-deer, Virginia deer, the two sorts of 
caribou, bison, musk-oxen, big-horns, mountain 
goats, antelope, grizzly, polar, black, and big 
brown bears, pumas, and lynxes. Each of these 
beasts forms the subject of a chapter, in which 
its habits are described, its haunts given, and 



some experiences in shooting it, generally those 
of Mr, Huntington himself, set forth in a man- 
ner intended to be of assistance to others in sim- 
ilar quests. There is also a preliminary dis- 
cussion of arms and ammunition. The book is 
illustrated by reproduced photographs from life, 
showing the animals as they have appeared in 
their native wilds. 



A book Mr. Andrew Lang has put to- 

of famous gether in a volume called 'His- 

mystenes. torical Mysteries' (Longmans), 

fourteen short sketches, previously printed in 
various periodicals, all of which have the interest 
of uncertainty, and some of which have a genu- 
ine historical bearing. Among the latter are 
'The Cardinal's Necklace,' 'The Gowrie Con- 
spiracy,' 'The Case of Allan Breck,' and others, 
while mysteries not really historical, in the sense 
of having any relation to important incidents in 
history, but rather famous for the contemporane- 
ous interest excited in them, are 'The Case of 
Elizabeth Canning,' and 'The Strange Case of 
Daniel Dunglas Home.' In the last-mentioned 
essay, Mr. Lang's own interest in spiritualistic 
manifestations is made evident. But each of 
these is much more a study than a sketch, for 
the evidence is given, and being carefully weighed 
with a true historical sense, some conclusion is 
reached, the whole being presented in a form at 
once suggestive and convincing. Thus the vol- 
ume is both valuable as a bit of careful research 
and entertaining as a collection of stoi-ies. 



Memoirs of Major General William Heath, a 

a Continental native of Roxbury, Massachusetts, 
officer. served in the Continental forces 

of the Revolutionary War during the entire eight 
years of that memorable contest between the 
colonists and England. In 1798 he published his 
Memoirs, consisting of a daily journal Avhich he 
had kept during the war, supplemented by recol- 
lections of other participants. The book has been 
out of print for many years, but is now restored 
in an attractive form as one of a series of 
'Source-Books of American History' (A. Wes- 
sels Company). Heath was unfortunate in de- 
laying an attack upon Port Independence, with 
which he was entnisted in January, 1777,— a de- 
linquency that brought upon him the wrath of 
the Commander-in-Chief and probably prevented 
him from being entrusted with another important 
command during the war. He makes a mild de- 
fense of his conduct in his Memoirs. The book 
is of value also for its accounts of the disposi- 
tion of Burgoyne after his surrender, of Arnold 's 
treason, and of the surrender of Cornwallis. 



A 'true' One of the most readable of recent 

biography of biographies is that by Mr. Joseph 
Henry Clay. -^^ Rogers, entitled 'The True 
Henry Clay' (Lippincott). Following the plan 
of the series of which it is a part, Clay's life 
and work are taken up topically, each of the 
twenty-seven ehaptei*s giving one of their many 
interesting aspects. This method involves, of 
course, more or less repetition, but it adds to 



1905.] 



THE DIAL

the completeness and interest of the work. As 
Clay was a leader in public affairs for nearly 
fifty years after taking his seat as senator dur- 
ing Jefferson's administration, there is necessa- 
rily much about politics in the book; but the 
emphasis is on the personal side. The author is 
an admirer of Clay, yet he tells the truth about 
him, not glossing over his defects and frailties 
or attempting to cover his blunders. The book 
contains twenty-four excellent illustrations, and 
is put forth in the attractive dress of the series 
to which it belongs. 



An outline of 
the French 
Revolution. 



The second volume of a brief 
work on the French Revolution, 
by Miss Sophia H. MacLehose, 
is entitled 'From the Monarchy to the Repub- 
lic in France' (Macmillan). As in the preceding 
volume, the author presents very briefly an out- 
line of the events of the period, citing numerous 
references, and giving a long list of authorities, 
for neither of which is there any necessity in a 
work of this elementary character. Yet the out- 
line in itself is good, and it is possible that read- 
ers may, as the author hopes, be attracted to a 
study of longer histories, by the interest cre- 
ated in incidents here only summarized. The 
numerous reproductions of old cuts and engrav- 
ings furnish one distinctly valuable feature of 
the book. 



XOTES. 



'Xapoleon and his Times' is the title of the next 
volume to appear in the Cambridge Modern His- 
tory. It follows in the series the volume on 'The 
French Bevolution' published last spring. 

The series of 'Twelve English Statesmen' is to 
be brought to a conclusion shortly by Mr. Frederic 
Harrison's biography of Chatham, which the Mac- 
millan Co. announce for publication this month. 

The University of Chicago Press will shortly 
issue 'The Progress of Hellenism in Alexander's 
Empire,' by Prof. John P. Mahaffy. a compendium 
of the long and brilliant development of human 
culture under Greek influence. 

The series of six lectures delivered last fall at 
the Art Institute of Chicago by Mr. Bussell Sturgis 
win be published next month by Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. in a profusely-illustrated volume 
entitled 'The Interdependence of the Arts.' 

One of the most interesting biographical works 
of the present season will undoubtedly be found 
in the Hon. Andrew D. White 's Autobiography and 
Reminiscences, to be published this month by the 
Century Co. Some portions of the book have 
already appeared in recent issues of 'The Century 
Magazine. ' 

Two books of timely interest in connection with 
the approaching Lewis and Clark Exposition are 
announced by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. for 
publication within a few weeks. 'From the West 
to the West,' by Abigail Scott Duniway, is an 
account in fiction form of a joiu"ney across the 
plains to Oregon, giving a picture of the perils and 
hardships, as well as the romantic incidents, of 
travel fifty years ago. The other book, 'Letters 
from an Oregon Ranch,' tells of an attempt to 
create a home in the Western wilderness. 



Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. will follow up their 
attractive edition of the Barsetshire and Parlia- 
mentary novels of Anthony TroUope with a new 
series to be called the Manor House novels. 'Orley 
Farm' is announced as the first volume. 

Messrs. Laird & Lee send us their library edition 
of 'Webster's Xew Standard Dictionary of the 
Englsh Language,' as compiled by Mr. E. T. Roe. 
It makes a volume of nearly eight hundred pages, 
illustrated and indexed, is leather-bound, and 
enclosed in a box. 

'Der Herzog von Mailand,' being a free transla- 
tion of Massinger's 'The Duke of Milan,' made 
by Herr Hermann Conrad, is published in the 
Greiner and Pfeiffer (Stuttgart) series of 'Bucher 
der Weisheit und Schonheit,' obtainable in this 
country from Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Besides the regular single-volume edition of Mrs. 
Humphry Ward's brilliant novel, 'The Marriage 
of William Ashe,' just published by the Messrs. 
Harper, there will be a special edition in two vol- 
umes, limited to one thousand sets, each copy of 
which will bear the autograph of the author. 

A cheerful little book on 'The Funeral: Its Con- 
duet and Proprieties,' by Mr. Joseph X. Greene, is 
published by Messrs. Jennings & Graham. Under 
the four heads of the undertaker, the minister, the 
bereaved, and the friends, the etiquette of the 
subject is discussed, and many useful suggestions 
are made. 

The Messrs. Putnam have just begun the publi- 
cation of a new and uniform edition of the late 
Leslie Stephen's essays. The edition is to comprise 
eleven volumes, of which four, containing the 
'Hours in a Library,' are now at hand. We need 
hardly say at this late day that these are all but 
the most delightful literary essays in the EngUsh 
language, and that their present convenient repub- 
lication deserves the warmest sort of a welcome. 

'A List of Arabic Manuscripts in Princeton Uni- 
versity Library,' compiled by Dr. Enno Littmann 
and published by the University, makes public the 
contents of an important collection which has 
recently been deposited in the Princeton library by 
Mr. Robert Garrett. This is a supplement to the 
Houtsma catalogue, the two together making up 
what is probably the richest collection of Oriental 
manuscripts to be found in any American library. 

A new series devoted to matters of present-day 
religion and morals is to be begun shortly by Messrs. 
A. S. Barnes & Co. It will present books by men 
of such distinction as Rev. Dr. Charles Cuthbert 
Hall, President of the Union Theological Semi- 
nar v. Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden, Rev. Dr. 
William C. Bitting, and Rev. Dr. Wm. Douglas 
Mackenzie, President of the Hartford Theological 
Seminary. The editor of the series. Dr. Henry A. 
Stimson, has written the first volume, which is 
entitled 'The Right Life.' 

'The Forms of Public Address,' edited by Prof. 
George P. Baker, and published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co., is an adjunct to rhetorical instruction 
which college teachers of the subject will find 
extremely useful. It is essentially an annotated 
volume of examples, with an introduction. Among 
the species of composition illustrated are letters, 
editorials, eulogies, dedications, after - dinner 
speeches, and addresses of various sorts. Thus the 
editorial section gives us sixteen examples of this 
form of writing, reprinted from such journals as 
The Dial, ' The Nation, ' ' The Spectator, ' ' The Inde- 
pendent,' and several newspapers.

THE HUMAN 
TOUCH 

A Tale 

of the Great Southwest 

By Edith M. NiCHOLii 
Here ia a novel of uncommon power and strength, as well 
aa heart interest. The story is one of affinity ; of the " human 
touch " that draws man and woman together wherever it 
appears in its might, regardless of any obstacles. It is a 
thoroughly American story, full of good red blood and life, 
enlivened with humor, and rich in an unusually large number 
of such characters as win and hold the attention of readers. 

niostrated by Charles Copeland :: $1.50

a good story, full of rich humor and character study, will find

what energy and tact can do in the way of improving streets 
and homes in those sections most in need of it, and general 
social uplift, will be charmed with the story of what one irre- 
pressible young woman accomplished in a neighborhood almost 
as unpromising as the celebrated "cabbage patch."

From Gibraltar to the South Seas, the course of the twice abducted yacht is marked by a succession of delightful and surprising adventures 
which keep the reader in suspense. It is a story full of red blood and dramatic situations told in the vigorous, inimitable way that has gained 
for the author so wide an audience. 

THE UNWRITTEN LAW 

A Novel. By ARTHUR HENRY, author of " The House in the Woods " and " An Island Cabin."' 12mo, cloth. $1.50. 

In the drama of our modern life enacted in these striking pages the author has drawn his pictures boldly, and his story portrays with 
pathos, variety, and sincerity distinct types of the American girl and the world as she finds it. The Unwritten Law has a new strength, unex- 
pectedness, and grasp which distinguish it as the earnest work of a man who writes because he is full of a vital theme.

A modern, every-day book, suggestive, practical, helpful, which brings home the spiritual side of life with peculiar closeness to parents,

President Arthur T. Hadley, of Yale University, says, in a letter to the author : "If the young men and women of the next generation 
could be permeated with the views and ideals which underlie this book it would be a most useful thing for their conduct and their character." 

Dr. Alfred E. Stearns, Principal of Phillips-Andover Academy, says : " The book is a real treasure. I shall recommend it."

tions. 8vo, cloth. $2.00 net. {Ready late in March.) 

The author's wide experience has shown the need of a popular synthesis of the new discoveries in science which separately have been mak- 
ing so profound an impression, and his book may be recommended to all, whether readers or students, who have followed the significant announce- 
ments made from time to time in behalf of such scientists as Becquerel, the Curies, Ramsay, Crookes, and others. Professor Duncan gives a 
general view of the newest knowledge of science and its possibilities.

IMPORTANT APRIL ANNOUNCEMENTS 
SERENA A Novel By Virginia Frazer Boyle 

{Ready early in April.) 12mo, cloth. $1.50. Author of " Devil Tales." 

This novel, opening as it does with a quaint picture of "underground railway proselyting in the South," shows in a series of brilliant 
sketches the old life with the tournaments, balls, and duels, which was changed so abruptly by the call to war. 

ON TYBEE KNOLL By James B. Connolly 

{Ready late in April.) 12mo, cloth. $1.25. Author of " The Seiners," etc. 

This vigorous novel is a stirring story of the fight of men who make clear the way for the ships. The scene is on the coast of Georgia 
where there is warfare between sea and land. There, like outposts in a hostile country, the engineers lead a half amphibious life fighting to keep 
the balance between sea and land. 

PARTNERS OF THE TIDE By Joseph C. Lincoln 

{Ready late in April.) 12mo, cloth. With Frontispiece and Decorations. $1.50. Author of " Cap'n Eri." 

The quaint humor of the coast flavors this fresh, strong story throughout. The delightful old maids who " sort o' compromised on a boy 
as there wan't no bids in the man line," are distinctive characters. The "boy " becomes the hero and takes up the life of the coast, and bis 
adventures with Cap'n Titcomb afford a fresh and striking series of pictures of a life which will be new to most readers. 

THE SUNSET TRAIL By Alfred Henry Lewis 

{Ready late in April.) Author of "The Boss," "The President," "Wolfville Days," etc. 

12mo, cloth. Illustrated. $1.50. 
Hr. Lewis's return to the West has given us a book picturesque, dramatic, and full of humor. The extraordinary experiences of gentlemen

LIFE IN THE 17TH CENTURY By George Gary Eggleston 

{Ready late in April.) Author of "A Captain in the Ranks," "Running the River," etc. 

12mo, cloth. With numerous Illustx-ations. $1.50 net. 
With the charm of a storyteller and the sympathetic insight of an experienced writer of history Mr. Eggleston tells the story of our first 
century in this volume. The familiar facts are used as landmarks for a narrative of life. He has aimed to show 17th Century history as life 
with reference to manners and customs, occupations and forms of government, and the various familiar phases of daily activity which have the 
largest personal interest. His history as such is consecutive, but emphasis is placed upon life rather than politics or war.

OUR PIONEER AMERICAN FOET. 

There are estates which are held by the 
payment of a rose or a piece of fruit in an- 
nual rent. The intellectual domains which 
we take from great writers deserve at least an 
equal acknowledgment. Some legacies indeed 
of this kind demand knight-service: we must 
go to war to defend our king and almoner, 
dead though he be. Our first true American 
poet, however, does not need the help of sword 
or torch. He is serene and secure in hi^ 
modest greatness, and there is nothing for us 
to do but to bring to his grave-throne our 
small tributes of criticism and appreciation. 

It is related of Lao Tsze that he was car- 
ried in his mother's womb for seventA* or eighty 
3'ears, so that when he was bom his hair was 
white and his form hoar with antiquity. The 
youth of nineteen, who, in a new country, 
amid a race of pioneers, wrote ' Thanaix)psis ' 
certainly recalls the Chinese philosopher. The 
dominant note in William Cullen Bryant's 
poetry is age. Age, engulfment, resignation, 
death, — these motives return again and again 
in his poems. 'Hiey are good themes, and 
there is no reason whv- a poet should not be 
especially bom to express them; but the sin- 
gular thing is that they should be sung as the 
herald notes of our poetic dawn. One would 
think that then, if at all, would sound the 
music of Spring and Kesurrection ; then would 
glow pictures of buoyant action — the red col*' 
ors of love and war. 

Without meaning anything but praise, it 
may be said of Bryant's poems in general that 
Wordsworth forgot to write them. A few of 
them rise to the height of Wordsworth's best, 
and they never sink to the level of his worst. 
But of course in mass, in range, in fire, the 
English poet is immeasurably beyond his 
American double or pupil. There is a differ- 
ence, too, in their view of Nature and outlook 
on man's destiny. Wordsworth is the poet of 
immortality — of resurrection ; the Xature he 
loved was ablaxe with Spirit. Bryant's Xature 
is the Xature of the chemists and geologists 
and geographers. He lacked metaphysics. 
How often has he repeated the idea of man 
returning to his original elements, — of engulf- 
ment in the grave I By iteration he makes it 
impressive. Yet it is probably best to touch 
such thoughts, and leave them. Omar's speak- 
ing jar gives us a more vivid sense of the mat- 
ter. And after all, the idea, poetically speak- 
ing, is nothing much. If man is spirit, his 



224 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



sinking into the grave is of little consequence; 
and if earth is spirit, too, it is of still less. 
It is remarkable that Bryant keeps his Stoic 
conception of virtue and morality so high 
while yielding to an almost Lucretian sense of 
the constitution of the world. 

Bryant has in poetry the felicity which the 
Psalmist prayed for, — neither poverty nor 
riches. Yet his severe taste saved him from 
that inevitable instinct for the second-best 
which has ruined so much American verse. He 
always recalls the masters; and when it is not 
Wordsworth's star which is in the ascendant, 
it is that of Milton, or Gray, or Collins. He 
was perhaps the most careful student of verse 
we have had. But his music is too often a 
recollected air. His pictures, — achieving, as 
they frequently do, the virgin phrase, cool, 
dewy, and unravished of man, — lack yet the 
ecstacy of more daring souls. The sacred 
spark in him was a lambent phosphorescence, 
incapable of communicating heat or fire. 

Lyrical poetry does not lend itself easily to 
criticism. The spontaneous gush of thought, 
the record of fleeting emotion, it is too evanes- 
cent in its nature to admit of dissection. 
One does not analyze thistle-down, or break 
a butterfly on the wheel. When the creating 
and combining powers come in, we can try to 
trace their progression and culmination in a 
work of genius, and compare the results with 
other productions of a like order. But a good 
lyric ought to be unitary and unique. Per- 
haps the best way to discuss a writer whose 
work consists of a multitude of short pieces is 
to state first the general impression they pro- 
duce, and then go on and say what one can of 
the single poems. 

The largest division of Bryant's work is the 
group of blank-verse pieces, including ' Than- 
atopsis,' 'The Forest Hymn,' 'The Prairies,' 
'Earth,' 'Hymn to Death,' 'The Flood of 
Years,' and a few others. As far as theme and 
matter are concerned, they are practically all 
one, — the same thoughts in varied settings. 
The earliest written of them sums up their 
whole message, and the world has accepted it 
as the greatest. In manner, however, they are 
equally good; and it is a manner which makes 
a small thing seem almost colossal. The blank- 
verse is studied from Wordsworth, who got his 
by inheritance through Cowper from Milton. 
Neither in Wordsworth nor in Bryant, how- 
ever, is there anything which much resembles 
Milton's sidereal style. And the two later 
poets differ from each other. In Wordsworth's 
best blank-verse there is a sense of growth, 
a pulsating vitality, a pushing upward as of 
forest trees, each trying to be tallest. In Bry- 
ant's lines there is the faltering, soundless fall 
of Autumn leaves detaching themselves with- 



out wind. His verse, however, is a most fit 
instrument for the meditative mood. Infe- 
rior in passages to Wordsworth's similar work, 
it is superior in single lines, and has far fewer 
lapses into prose. 

Bryant's poems which bear upon wild-life in 
America, aboriginal or that of the early set- 
tlers, such as ' The Disinterred Warrior,' ' The 
Hunter of the Prairies,' ' Catterskill Falls,' 
have all a stamp of deep and grave sincerity. 
They are miniatures, and require a magnify- 
ing-glass to bring out their merits. But even 
after Cooper's great canvasses, painted with a 
broad brush, these little vignettes repay study. 

There are a good many of Bryant's minor 
pieces which have a sort of faded elegance, as 
if they were originally written for the old 
Books of Beauty — the Annuals of our early 
literature. They are not in the least vital, — 
they are purely manufactured; but their arti- 
fice is well done. A list of these would be too 
long to give, but in it would be ' The Song of 
the Greek Amazon,' ' Song of Pitcairn's Isl- 
and,' 'The Damsel of Peru.' A poem like 
' The Lapse of Time ' is of a higher mood ; yet 
it too is irritating: it is so near the common- 
place, yet manages to evade actual prosaism. 
It reminds one of some of the slighter, prelu- 
sive strains of Collins, which have nothing in 
them but an ineffable grace — the classic air. 

But I must come to the handful of lyrics 
which are Bryant's real title-deeds to fame 
signed and sealed by the Muse. Two little 
odes I would first mention, not for any spe- 
cial mark of thought or phrase which they 
possess, but because of their originality in 
metre. They are 'The Greek Partisan' and 
an ' Ode for a Celebration.' Most poets, when 
they try to bring a variety of rhythm into a 
short compass, merely change the length of 
their lines; but Bryant here changes the key 
of the music, as Gray did. These brief poems 
have in consequence a dancing movement 
which is most effective. 

'The Siesta' is probably the nearest ap- 
proach to a real song that Bryant ever wrote. 
Some other of his things which are labelled 
songs are as wooden as clothes-pegs, as cold as 
icicles. The ' Song of Marion's Men ' is a 
martial lyric, and a fine one, though it comes 
far short of equalling the war-poems of Burns 
and Campbell, or even two more recent Amer- 
ican patriotic strains, ' The Blue and the 
Gray,' and 'The Bivouac of the Dead.' Bry- 
ant's ' Greek Boy ' is also a Tyrtarean poem, 
and has real rather than painted fire. It is 
of course reminiscent of Byron's ' Isles of 
Greece.' 

In ' June ' for almost the first time we find 
Bryant standing impropped by any other poet.

THE DTATi

Collins and Wordsworth was in his mind when 
he wrote it, but for the nonce he forgot them 
and spoke straight from his soul. The diction 
of the piece is full of floating gold which con- 
centrates into one or two ingot-like phrases. 
* Oh, Fairest of the Rural Maids ' is almost 
equally good, but here Br}ant leans again on 
Wordsworth's shoulder, as he does in 'The 
Fringed Gentian.' ' Autunm Woods ' is entire- 
ly original and absolutely flawless. Singularly 
enough, Bryant, usually so grave, not to say 
drab, in his coloring, here gives the gayest pic- 
ture of American Autumn which exists in our 
literature. Mark the art or the unconscious 
truth with which he assembles all the bright 
aspects of the season, — the woods which have 
put their glory on, the colored landscape, the 
gay company of trees, the painted leaves, the 
sun's quiet smile, the absence of gloom where 
many branches meet, the stream that shines 
with the image of its golden screen, the rose- 
ate canopy where a maiden's blush would be 
unmarked! The word 'colored' is repeated 
three times, probably with intention. Alto- 
gether it is the most perfect piece of objec- 
tive work which Bryant ever achieved, and 
needs only a touch of magical imagination to 
place it fairly by the side of Keats's best. 
Hardly less admirable is * The Death of the 
Flowers,' a little elegy whose sweet and gentle 
perfection make of it a sister-song to Collins's 
' Fidele,' and even render it worthy to stand, 
at some remove, in the presence of the Death 
Song in ' Cymbeline.' The simple fitness of 
the epithets throughout the piece is Greek ; and 
the exquisitely modulated metre is perhaps the 
most lyrical movement in all Bryanf s verse. 

There remain Bryant's three crowning 
poems — ' To the Past.' ' Lines to a Water- 
fowl,' and ' The Battlefield.' The first has an 
air of antique greatness. Its bareness is im- 
pressive as of a Spanish Hidalgo presiding at 
his empty board with an inestimable jewel or 
two, heirlooms spared by Fate, glittering on 
his fingers. The piece contains what is proba- 
bly Bryant's finest line, — 

' And features, the great soul's apparent seat,' 

although 

' Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,' 

from ' Thanatopsis,' and 

' "The desert and illimitable air,' 

of the ' Lines to a Waterfowl,' are near rivals. 
The last-named poem is the quintessence of 
Bryant's genius. Neither in motive nor man- 
ner does it recall any other poet, and there 
is none throughout time who would not be 
proud to own it. Yet I think 'The Battle- 
field ' is his final and supreme triumph. Beauty 
and splendor of picture are here, and a grandeur 
of utterance which might have been thundered 
from Sinai. 



What is Bryanfs rank among our American 
singers? Poe is greatest in prose, his verse 
being merely the gold fringe on his prose suit 
of sables; yet even in poetr}' he keeps his 
precedence. He keeps it by reason of his 
strange originality, his almost unequalled gift 
of proportion and effect, his charm of haunt- 
ing melody and unforgetable picturing. In 
weight and felicity of single phrase, however, 
he is certainly not equal to either Bryant or 
Emerson; and by virtue of this felicity, allied 
to a considerable gift of design, Bryant, I 
should say, must rank second. Emerson's 
shower of verbal sparks, which hardly ever 
coalesced into a star-like poem, can only place 
him third. Walt Whitman is a purely l3rrical 
poet, but even yet it is hard to assay and 
value his dithyrhambic verse. In the great 
battle of the Ramayana, Laksmana is mortally 
wounded, and Hanuman, the monkey magician 
of the epic, is sent to a distant moimtain for 
an herb of healing to revive the hero. What 
with the length of the journey and his adven- 
tures by the way, Hanuman forgets the de- 
scription of the plant. ' Something there was,* 
he says, 'of red, something of white, something 
of gold.' But he cannot make up his mind 
which of the flowering things he sees around 
him is the right one; so he plucks up the 
whole mountaiu by the roots, and conveys it 
back to the field of battle. This is perhaps an 
exaggerated comparison for Whitman's poetry; 
there is a sense of mass and greatness in 
him, yet it is most diflBcult to discover in all 
his pages that plant of charm and healing 
which we call poetry. 

Lowell is reported to have said, late in life, 
'We were none of us as great poets as we 
thought we were.' None indeed of our classic 
writers had, in poetry at least, any great crea- 
tive gifts. There were lyrists, occasional poets ; 
and it is useless to try to push lyrical and 
occasional poetry into competition with the 
large, continued creations of Literature. The 
question is easily decided. Let anyone ask 
himself which the world could better afford to 
lose, all the poetry — the best of its kind 
in the language — contained in Palgrave's 
' Golden Treasury,' or Shakespeare's ' Hamlet.' 
The verdict could hardly be long in doubt. 
Much would we miss, much would drop from 
us, if the passion and pathos and imagination 
of England's lyrists were obliterated; but 
' Hamlet ' is woven into the very texture of 
the souls, not only of our race, but of man- 
kind. Yet it is only one of a number of 
nearly equal pla}^ by a single author. And 
the same judgment would almost certainly 
have to be rendered if the case were ' Paradise 
Lost' against the whole body of lyrical verse 
in English. However, we cannot do without

COMMUNICA TION. 



COOPERATION IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The establishment of a fully equipped American 
bibliographical institute is a desidei'atum that 
has been suggested more than once, though there 
is some difference of opinion, even among those 
who have carefully considered the matter, as to 
the endowment required. One proposition pub- 
lished calls for a fund of two hundred thousand 
dollars, or an implied income of from eight thou- 
sand to ten thousand dollars per annum. A much 
smaller sum could, however, be used advantageous- 
ly in the pursuit of certain restricted lines of 
investigation. The importance of encouraging 
bibliographical research in America, is well un- 
derstood and ought, ere long, to result in the 
creation of an institution especially fitted 
for the task. The cataloguing or bibliography 
of books, as books, is receiving so much 
attention from the Library of Congress and 
other institutions that, irrespective of the great 
value of such work, there is perhaps no urgent and 
immediate need of additional undertakings of ex- 
actly the same sort. The purpose of this note, 
therefore, is to suggest another field of investiga- 
tion whose fruitfulness is unlimited. 

Students and general readers frequently come 
across facts which, being curious or little known, 
or for other special reasons, are likely to be of 
general interest, and should be so recorded as to 
make them more accessible. Let the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington or one of the principal 
colleges commence the publication of a 'Miscella- 
nea Curiosa,' comprising bibliographical notices 
collected by special investigators, general readers, 
and others, with notes and queries. Occasionally, 
an item found could be made the basis of a 
quest for additional information. American col- 
leges, through their faculties and students, could 
well cooperate with the editor, by contributing 
notices from time to time, and special branches of 
knowledge might be pursued when desired. One 
of the most important desiderata, as observed by 
the writer in 'Public Libraries,' March (10:123, 
124), would be the formation of a good working 
bibliogi-aphy of bibliographies, which could be 
included, as the scope of the 'Miscellanea Curi- 
osa' need not be limited. 

All the notices published should be duly ar- 
ranged and classified in very much the same man- 
ner as in that model volume, the 'A. L. A. Cat- 
alog,' 1904 edition, issued by the Library of 
Congress. The order of the notices would thus 
eonfoi-m to the common practice of the majority 
of American libraries, which would conduce to the 
accessibility of the work. A special edition of 
the 'Miscellanea Curiosa' could be printed upon 
only one side of the paper, permitting the separ- 



ation of individual notices for gumming upon 
index-cards. As to the work itself, an extended 
illustration of its proposed contents could be 
compiled with little expense of time and labor; 
but the few notices given below wall perhaps 
suffice for the present. The customary classifica- 
tion is here omitted to economize space.

The liLFE-TToRK of THEoi>oitE Thomas.* 



The Theodore Thomas book, now given to 
the public just three months after the death 
of the great conductor, has been prepared by 
his almost life-long friend, Mr. George P. 
Upton, dean of musical critics in this country, 
and a man thoroughly fitted for his task, both 
by his musicianly equipment of experience and 
instinct, and by his skill in the art of effective 
literary presentation. The book was projected 
long before the lamented death of Mr. Thomas, 
and was thus well in hand at the time when he 
so unexpectedly laid down his baton forever, 
which fact accounts for its appearance with 
such fortunate promptness. 

The interest of this book naturally centres 
in the hundred pages or so of the Autobiog- 
raphy. These chapters constitute a ver}- matter- 
of-fact statement, bare of all ornament, and 
devoid of the slightest literary pretence, yet 
highly important by virtue of their subject- 
matter. His life-histor}- begins as follows: 
' According to the records of the church in 
Esens, East Friesland, by the Xorth Sea, I 
was born on the 11th of October, 1835. At this 
place my father was Stadtpfeifer/ Here we 
have corrected the statement made in many of 
the recent obituary notices that Essen (of 
Krupp celebrity) was the birthplace of Theo- 
dore Thomas. It appears, indeed, that he was 
bom in Holland, and was saved from being a 
Dutchman only by his German parentage. Of 
his boyish musical ventures, he says: 

'I have been told that I played the violin in pub- 
lic at the age of five. I have not, however, the 
slightest remembrance of when I began to play. 
My earliest recollection is that my father played 
the violin, so I played, and that I soon played the 
music he did. The members of his band, or orches- 
tra, amused themselves by bringing music to me 
and trying to find something that I could not read 
off at sight.' 

It was in the summer of 1845 that the 
Thomas family emigrated to Xew York, hav- 
ing a six weeks' passage on an American mer- 
chant vessel. The father had a large family 
to support, and Theodore contributed assistance 
by plapng at theatres and dancing-schools. In 
his thirteenth year he, together with liis father, 
enlisted in a navy band stationed at Ports- 
mouth, Virginia. A year lat«r, Theodore ob- 
tained his discharge, and started South on a 
concert tour of his own. 

'I do not remember taking anything with me 
but my fiddle, ray little box of clothing, and some 
posters which I had had printed, announcing a con- 

• Theodore Thomas. A Musical Autobiography. Edited 
by George P. Upton. In two volumes. Illustrated. Chi- 
cago : A. C. McCIurg ft Co. 



cert by "Master T. T. " I kept a supply of these 
posters in my trunk, and when I had no money I 
first obtained permission to use the dining hall of 
a hotel for a concert, and then I went around on 
the day before the concert took place and put up 
my posters with tacks. When the time for the con- 
cert arrived, I would stand at the door of the hall 
and take the money until I concluded that my audi- 
ence was about gathered, after which I woxild go to 
the front of the hall, unpack my violin, and begin 
the concert. Sometimes I played with piano accom- 
paniment, but oftener without. I have yet in my 
possession a set of variations on ' ' Home, Sweet 
Home," which I wrote down some years later as 
a souvenir of those days. I did not have printed 
programmes. ' 

Returning to Xew York the next year, Theo- 
dore found a new German theatre established, 
and was engaged as leading violinist. ' Here I 
received my first intellectual impetus, by becom- 
ing acquainted with the plays of the great Ger- 
man poets.' He also remarks, incidentally, 
that ^better music wa^ played in the theatres 
then than at "the present time.' The modem 
play-goer, if he have not the facts necessary for 
comparison, is at any rate prepared to admit 
that no music could be worse than what he 
now hears in such places of amusement. The 
great singers who came to America in the early 
fifties did much to form the musician's taste 
during those impressionable years. But the 
problem of actual living remained a difficult 
one, as the following anecdote attests : 

'Once, when I was a boy, I remember, seeing no 
way of earning the money for my board, I took my 
fiddle under my coat, went to the bar-room of a 
hotel, and played, and soon had the money I needed, 
after which I left. Other well-known musicians 
had to beat the big drum all day in street parades. 
I was, fortunately, not driven to that.' 

In 1853, Thomas played first violin in the 
orchestra of L. A. Jullien, described as ^the 
musical charlatan of all ages,' who then came 
to Xew York, bringing with him some excel- 
lent performers. Karl Eckert, the leader of 
Mme. Sontag's orchestra, was his next master, 
and made him ' principal ' of the second violins ; 
besides exerting over him an influence which 
' probably laid the foundation of my future 
career.' A year later, he became ' concert- 
meister' under Arditi, whose troupe included 
such singers as Lagrange and Mirate. Of the 
latter he says : * I have always considered 
Mirate the greatest tenor I have heard, without 
exception, in voice, compass, method, and musi- 
cianship.' And yet, such is the evanescenc-e of 
the singers fame, his name is not now to be 
found in any of the modern dictionaries of 
music I 

It was under Eckert that Thomas first be- 
came concerned with the work of orchestral 
management. He was entrusted with the func- 
tion of making engagements with the men, and 
says that ' from that time on there was prob-

ably no good instrumentalist who did not spend 
his first years in America with the orchestra I 
formed/ From the performance of this func- 
tion to the organization of his own orchestra 
was a stage in the conductor's evolution that 
covered the next ten years. The chief episodes 
of those years, as far as Thomas was concerned, 
were his connection with the Philharmonic 
Society of New York, his chamber concerts 
given with William Mason, and his work as 
' concertmeister ' with Ullmann's opera com- 
pany. Meanwhile, he was making a thorough 
study of harmony and counterpoint. 

In commenTUig upon Thomas's long period 
of orchestral leadership, which began in New 
York in 1864, and ended with the end of last 
year in Chicago, just after the fourteenth sea- 
son of the Chicago Orchestra was well under 
way, and the permanent home of the organi- 
zation had received its inspiring dedication, we 
shall attempt little more than the singling out 
of a few suggestive bits of the Autobiography, 
and of Mr. Upton's following chapters of 
' Eeminiscence and Appreciation.' We are not 
apt to think of Thomas as a joker, but the 
following story from his early years pleasantly 
illustrates the more genial side of his nature : 

'We also had many little extravaganzas, which 
provoked much amusement. On one occasion, for 
instance, while playing the "Linnet Polka," I re- 
quested the piccolo players to climb up into the 
trees before the piece began. When they com- 
menced playing from their exalted position in the 
branches, it made a sensation. I remember another 
funny incident which happened about this time. In 
the "Carnival of Venice" the tuba player had been 
sent, not up the trees, but back of the audience into 
the shrubbery. When he began to play the police 
mistook him for a practical joker who was dis- 
turbing the music, and tried to arrest him! I shall 
never forget the comical scene, as the poor man 
fled toward the stage, pursued by the irate police- 
man, and trying to get in a note here and there, as 
he ran.' 

Possibly we may consider in the light of a 
joke having Thomas for its victim his account 
of a visit from Barnum sometime during the 
seventies, when he was invited to tour the 
country, 'beside the fat woman and the ele- 
phant,' as an adjunct to the ' greatest show on 
earth.' ' This was a high tribute,' he adds, 
' but what had I done to deserve it ?' 

The Great Fire in Chicago played an impor- 
tant part in Thomas's fortunes, for he had been 
booked to open the season of the Crosby Opera 
House on the evening of the very day when the 
city — opera house and all — was laid in ashes. 
He reached the city while it was burning, and 
at once went through to St. Louis, the scene 
of his next engagement. He says : 

'Providence evidently wished to discipline me a 
little more. I was still too young, too presuming, 
and had too much vitality. But let that pass. It 



is sufficient that I became so involved financially 
by this disaster, and the consequent interruption of 
our tour, that it was many years before I recovered 
from my losses, and the wearisome travelling had 
to go on indefinitely.' 

Another unfortunate experience for Thomas 
personally (although the public benefitted vast- 
ly by it during two seasons) was his connection 
with the American Opera Company (1886-8). 
'The conductorship was offered to me, and I ac- 
cepted it, for I believed in the idea, and I knew it 
would also give my orchestra a permanent engage- 
ment, and relieve me from the responsibility of 
paying salaries. My hopes, however, were doomed 
to disappointment, for it soon became evident that 
there were peculiarities of management which 
neither art nor business could long endure. Finan- 
cially the case was soon hopeless, and the only 
question left for me was how to get out of the 
toils in which I had been cunningly ensnared. The 
management refused to allow the much-abused and 
at last fatally stricken organization to die a natural 
death or have decent burial, and so it came about 
that toward the close it was either a disgrace or a 
calamity to every one connected with it. Even 
after it finally was dead and buried, its apparition 
haunted different cities all over the country for a 
time. My official connection with it had been lim- 
ited to that of musical director. I had no business 
interest in it whatever, but I was for years after- 
wards involved in lawsuits brought against me by 
its victims.' 

These were dark days indeed, and Thomas 
in 1888 found himself seemingly no nearer to 
the permanent organization of which he so long 
had dreamed than he had been many years 
earlier. He even had to disband his orchestra, 
and become an itinerant conductor of impro- 
vised bands. This was the time when New 
York made ' the great refusal,' and missed the 
greatest musical opportunity in its history. 

But the clouds were even then ready to break, 
and Chicago was preparing to offer what New 
York had withheld. In 1890 the project of 
the Chicago Orchestra took shape, and the year 
following witnessed the beginning of Thomas's 
thirteen years of continuous leadership in this 
city. How a body of public-spirited citizens 
met the deficits of these concerts for thirteen 
years, and gave their unquestioning support to 
the highest ideal of musical art as represented 
by him, undisturbed by the popular clamor for 
cheapened music and lowered standards, is a 
matter of history so recent that it does not 
call for setting-forth in detail. The most recent 
history of all is that of the campaign for a per- 
manent home for the orchestra, a campaign 
successfully prosecuted, whereof the visible 
signs are the beautiful hall which since last 
December has opened its. doors weekly to thou- 
sands of delighted music-lovers, and in which 
the concerts now continue, and will continue 
indefinitely, uninterrupted even by the death 
of their organizer, save for the one occasion 
when respect for his memory and grief for

his loss closed the doors for a few days. The 
last words of the Autobiography are these: 

'We are now in the fourteenth season of the 
Chicago Orchestra. Its permanency is secure, its 
home is built, and the object for which I have 
worked all my life is accomplished. The old saying, 
"Better late than never," comes to mind as I see 
in my seventieth year the realization of the dreams 
of my youth. But I trust I may stiU live long 
enough to show my gratitude to the men and women 
who have made this possible, and to leave behind 
me a young and vigorous institution to crown the 
achievement with a long future.' 

^Ir. Upton's work begins where that of 
Thomas ends, and gives us, first of all, a few 
pages on ' The Last Days of Theodore Tliomas/ 
then a section of ' Reminiscence and Apprecia- 
tion ' extending to nearly one hundred and 
fifty pages. There is some supplementary 
material furnished for the early period, but in 
the main Mr. Upton has confined himself to 
the years since 1869, when Thomas first brought 
his orchestra to Chicago, and the critic first 
made his acquaintance. His first words to the 
writer (then and for many years thereafter 
musical critic of the Chicago ' Tribune ') were 
charcteristic. 

*I am glad to meet any friend of Mr. Dohn's, 
and will be pleased to have you come and see me 
while I am here. You must not expect me to call 
upon you, for I am too busy, and besides, I never 
go into newspaper offices. I have no need to culti- 
vate the critics, for I know my work. I do not 
care to read what they write, and would not have 
time if I did care.* 

Such was the beginning of a warm friendship 
that was to last for thirty-five years. Speak- 
ing of the work now published, which it took 
much persuasion to induce Thomas to sanction, 
he said: '1 will write my autobiography as 
part of our work. It will be only a general 
sketch of my life, and you must fiU in the de- 
tails, for which I have not time.' In thus 
completing the record, Mr. Upton has given 
us matter both light and serious, skilfully pre- 
serving the balance in a well-proportioned nar- 
rative. By way of diversion, we are given a 
number of amusing anecdotes. A Xew York 
town was being canvassed for a prospective con- 
cert, and the information vouchsafed by a lead- 
ing citizen that the 'show wouldn't pay much 
unless Thomas had a good end man.' Somewhere 
in Utah ' it was gravely suggested that the 
more wedding marches he had on his pro- 
gramme the better.' An Iowa critic thought 
that the Boccherini Minuet was unfairly dealt 
with by its performance pianissimo con sordini, 
on the ground that ' such a pretty tune deserves 
to be played louder.' In Keokuk, the amuse- 
ment purveyor was surprised to be informed 
that Thomas would not consent to play dance 
music after the concert was over and the flour 
cleaned. * Why not ? Can't they play dances 



well enough?' In a Michigan town, there was 
a municipal hold-up in the shape of an official 
intimation that the licence of the orchestra 
troupe would be revoked unless free tickets were 
sent to all the members of the common coun- 
cil. This concert was to be given in the court 
house, and when the city fathers arrived, 
armed with their free tickets, they were escorted 
to the jury box and the prisoner's pen, to the 
huge delight of the audience. 

By way of more serious matter, Mr. Upton 
reports such characteristic words of Thomas as 
the following: 

'Throughout my life my aim has been to make 
good music popular, and it now appears that I have 
only done the public justice in believing and acting 
constantly on the belief that the people would 
enjoy and support the best in art when continually 
set before them in a clear, intelligent manner.' 

The indomitable will which led him to 
eventual . success is finely illustrated in the 
following words: 

*I was hungry last night, but no fox gnawing at 
my side, as in the Spartan story, can make me aban- 
don the course of life I have laid out for myself. 
I have gone without food longer than I should, I 
have walked when I could not afford to ride, I have 
even played when my hands were cold, but I shall 
succeed, for I shall never give up my belief that 
at last the people will come to me, and my concerts 
will be crowded. I have undying faith in the latent 
musical appreciation of the American public' 

This tribute to Beethoven expresses in some 
slight degree the feeling with which the great- 
est of all composers is regarded by those who 
have lived for long years in communion with 
his work: 

'Take Beethoven's music, it is something more 
than mere pleasure; it is education, thought, emo- 
tion, love, and hope. I do not doubt that when my 
orchestra plays one of his symphonies, every soul 
in the audience is stirred in a different way and by 
a different suggestion. I care not from what sta- 
tion in life come the thousands who sit back of me. 
Beethoven will touch each according to his needs, 
and the very same cadence that may waft the 
thoughts of one to drowsy delight or oblivion may 
stir the heart of another to higher aspirations — 
may give another hope in his despair, may bring to 
yet another a message of love.' 

Mr. Upton's eloquent final characterization of 
Theodore Thomas must now be quoted. 

'Thus passed from our midst the great musician 
who had wrought so long, so devotedly, so courage- 
ously for the things that make for the refinement 
of life and for the ennobling of the spirit, never 
once degrading the great gift which had been given 
him, never yielding to a sordid consideration, nor 
compromising his art with commercialism. His life 
is an example for American youth of a great purpose 
nobly striven for, nobly won, of work for civic and 
individual righteousness, of patience in well-doing, 
of honors modestly received, of success richly 
earned. He has affected the lives of thousands of 
men and women for good, by diverting their tastes 
from the trivial and meretricious to nobler and 
purer things, for great music is a moral influence 



230 



THE DIAL

whose extent can hardly be measured. Life and 
music may be more intimately related than we 
know. Music helps to keep body and soul in health, 
and no man 's education can be called complete 
without it.' 

In the appendix to the first volume of this 
Avork, Thomas speaks to ns once more with his 
own mouth in the reprint of his weighty pages 
on ' Musical Possibilities in America/ first 
published in ' Scribner's Magazine ' for March, 
1881. The chief value of this paper is in its 
condemnation of the ' movable do system ' in 
elementary instruction, and its plea for absolute 
pitch as the only possible basis of sound musi- 
cal teaching. The voice is of one crying in the 
wilderness, but the logic is beyond the jwssi- 
bility of dispute. A reprinted newspaper arti- 
ele on ' Music in Chicago ' is also of much inter- 
est. The volume closes with some thirty pages 
of addresses, resolutions, and memorial tributes 
from various sources. 

The second volume of Mr. Upton's work is 
made up chiefly of the programmes of fifty 
years, beginning with the Mason- Thomas cham- 
ber concerts, and ending with the concerts of 
the Chicago Orchestra. As the selection had 
to be made from nearly ten thousand pro- 
grammes, many omissions were necessary, but 
fourteen important groups are given complete, 
and the others are t3^pically represented. For 
this volume, Tliomas wrote last summer a spe- 
cial introduction, extending to thirty-three 
pages, and dealing with the topics of pro- 
gramme-making, encores, late-comers, the prac- 
tical efi'ects of music, and the technique of the 
modern orchestra. The value of these notes is 
altogether out of proportion to their length, 
and we should like nothing better than to quote 
extensively from them. We will content our- 
selves with a single extract from the words 
addressed to the habitual late-comer. 

' Can a greater injustice be perpetrated on others 
who perhaps have made considerable sacrifice to be 
punctual, and have prepared themselves to enter 
into the spirit of the music to be performed, than 
suddenly and rudely to be aroused from a musical 
exaltation, in which they are oblivious of their 
surroundings, by persons who oblige them to rise 
and let them squeeze by to their seats, and who 
perhaps even talk, after they are seated, about 
something not at all in harmony with the music or 
the occasion? Why, everybody understands that it 
is not only rude to be late to a dinner party, but 
that the seating of the late-comer creates such a 
disturbance of the atmosphere that it is difficult 
to establish unity of feeling again for that evening. 
How much more fatal is it to the unity of a con- 
cert. ' 

As for the box-holders who indulge in noisy 
conversation, words are incapable of doing jus- 
tice to such offenders. ' I must be excused for 
giving an opinion on this species of disturb- 
ance, for ray gift of emphatic language is not 
adequate to the subject.' And yet Thomas had 



a very pretty talent for expressing himself em- 
phatically when emphasis seemed called for. 
His occasional habit of rebuking vulgar offend- 
ers against the rights of the music-lover is 
surely one of the blessings — even if a minor 
one — that we attach to his memory. And we 
liless him also for his insistence upon punctual- 
ity and the methods by which he enforced it, 
and for his determination not to mar the unity 
and balance of his programmes by concessions 
to the greedy inconsiderate persons who ask for 
encores, and above all for the determination 
which forced upon us, 5'ear after year, 
whether we liked it or not, the music that it 
was good for us to hear. It was a long and 
discouraging task, this education of the public 
taste in music, but it was accomplished at last, 
by a persistency of effort of which few men 
would have been capable, and Thomas lived 
long enough to know by experience that his 
efforts toward this end had been really worth 
while. This must have been even a greater 
satisfaction to him than the permanent estab- 
lishment of his orchestra, which he also lived to

The Close of the Civii. War and the 
Beginnixg of Reconstruction.* 



In the midst of a remarkable output of 
American historical works, it still remains 
true that the appearance of a new volume of 
Ehodes's History of the United States is one 
of the most important events in the field of 
historical endeavor. Readers who have had 
their expectations raised to a high pitch by a 
perusal of his previous volumes will find no 
disappointment in the fifth, which deals with 
the period of 1864-60. 

After a few words of recapitulation, the 
opening pages are devoted to a description of 
Sherman's famous march and of Hood's oper- 
ations in Tennessee. This campaign, which 
Sherman originated and to which he won the 
assent of his superiors only after much hesita- 
tion, must be classed as the most daring under- 
taken by the Union forces during the entire 
war. Sherman realized the great hazard, and 
that if ho failed ' this march would be ad- 
judged the wild adventure of a crazy fool,' 
But his mind was made up, and it only re- 
mained to provide for the contingencies that 
might arise from Hood's movements. The 
Federal forces must be so divided that the 
army which marched to the sea would be 
strong enough to beat off Hood, and that

which remained behind with Thomas strong 
enough to crush him. November 12, 1864, his 
arrangements being complete, Sherman burned 
the bridges and cut the telegraph wires behind 
him. and started on a march comparable only 
to that of Julian when he ' plunged into the 
recesses of the Marcian or Black Forest.' For 
thirty-two days the authorities at Washington 
received no tidings of him beyond what came 
through the Richmond papers. 

T^e march of these 62,000 men was but 
little more than a holiday picnic, for no 
enemy seriously opposed them, and forage wa;6 
abundant. Ruin and d^olation marked their 
progress in a track thirty miles wide. In the 
march through South Carolina, oflBcers and 
men took special delight in inflicting woes 
upon the State that they regarded as chiefly 
responsible for the war. The march was a 
punitive measure inflicted upon rebels to 
bring them to terms of peace. Eighty-three 
years before, a British general had marched 
through a land of rebels for a similar purpose. 
It will be interesting to compare their respec- 
tive policies.

It uuiy be pertinently remarked that om* 
march succeeded and the other failed. Tac- 
itus may also be quoted on that species of 
war which ' makes a desert and calls it peace.' 
It must have been reflections upon his famous 
march which gave to Sherman his no less 
famous description of war. 

An entire chapter is devoted to that most 
delicate of all subjects, prisoners of war. The 
authors treatment is not colorless, yet only 
the most radical on either side can take excep- 
tions to it. The records are incomplete, but 
from the best sources obtainable the author 
figures out that the mortality in Southern 
prisons was 15.5 per cent., while that in 
Northern prisons was a little more than 12 
per cent. When the different conditions of the 
two sections are considered, a greater differ- 
ence might have been expected. Perhaps the 
policy of reducing rations in retaliation was 
adopted by the authorities at Washington on 
insufficient grounds. The authors conclusion 



i.*i that, * All things considered, the statistics 
show no reason why the North should reproach 
the South. If we add to one side of the 
account the refusal to exchange the prisoners 
and the greater resources, and to the other the 
distress of the Confederacy, the balance struck 
will not be far from even. Certain it is that 
no deliberate intention existed either in 
Richmond or in Washington to inflict suffer- 
ings on captives more than inevitably ac- 
companied their confinement.' The inhu- 
manity is explained rather by the fact that 

' Prom wars imnambered evils flow, — 
The unexhausted source of every human woe.' 

Two chapters give interesting accounts of 
social conditions in the North and South dur- 
ing the war. This ac-count has often been 
given for the South, but we still get glimpses 
of things heretofore more or less in the dark. 
In both, sections there were gayety and gloom, 
hard times and extravagance, retrenchment 
and speculation, generosity and meanness, re- 
ligious devotion and shameless immorality, 
loyalty and disloyalty, honesty and dishonesty. 
In both sections the people suffered from the 
rigors of martial law; but in the South the 
suspension of the privileges of the writ of 
habeas corpus lasted for only one year, five 
months, and two days, and all this time by act 
of the Confederate Congress, while in the 
North the suspension lasted one year, ten 
months, and twenty-one days by Executive 
assumption, and the rest of the time by act 
of Congress. In a work of this scope one 
might reasonably have expected a fuller treat- 
ment of the very important subject of military 
arrests and the suppression of newspapers. 
The execution of Wm. B. Mumford at New 
Orleans is merely mentioned as the cause of 
Davis's proclamation of outlawry against But- 
ler, but the author fails to state that the exe- 
cution was on a charge of treason. If Mum- 
ford was a citizen of the United States, the 
Constitution prescribed the method for his 
trial, which was not followed; if he was an 
alien enemy, he could not have been guilty of 
treason against the United States. 

In the discussion of illicit trading with the 
enemy and frauds on the government, General 
Butler comes in for his due meed of blame for 
the questionable business transactions which 
brought him considerable wealth. Perhaps the 
General's reputation is black enough, but it 
might have been made still blacker had the 
author seen fit to go still more deeply into 
historical sources. If the suppressed report 
of the committee appointed by the War De- 
partment to investigate his conduct has not 
Wn destroyed, it certainly seems time for it 
to 1>e exploited. The surprising thing is, that

stem old Puritan Massachusetts, after Butler's 
career at N^ew Orleans and Norfolk, should 
have so highly honored this man whose ' repu- 
tion at the bar before the war broke out was 
that of an unscrupulous practitioner.' The 
shameless pillage and plunder engaged in by 
subordinates and common soldiers at New 
Orleans, largely under the guise of sequestra- 
tion and confiscation, are hardly mentioned in 
this narrative, though the newspapers of the 
day were full of specific references to them. 

As so much energy is now being expended 
on the history of Eeconstruction, the contribu- 
tion of Dr. Rhodes to that subject will be read 
with much interest. Under Lincoln's well- 
known ' ten-per-cent.' plan, the people of Louis- 
iana inaugurated a State government early 
in 1864. Lincoln wished to have Congrees 
recognize this government; but it was never 
done, though two Congressmen from Louisiana 
had been admitted to seats a little more than 
a year before. The author does not bring out 
the internal condition of Louisiana, the 
wretched divisions and bickerings of the 
Unionists, and the fact that the government 
was the creature of the military power, which 
would have justified Congress in refusing rec- 
ognition. However, the puny child might 
have developed a strong body by careful nurs- 
ing. But this was not the reason why Con- 
gress held back. It was due rather, as the 
author points out, to the obstinacy of Senator 
Sumner, who, though a majority favored the 
resolution, would not allow it to pass because 
the new constitution of Louisiana had not 
conferred the suffrage on the negro. And 
herein was foreshadowed that long series of 
evils subsequently poured upon the wretched 
South by Sumner and by Thaddeus Stevens. 

In strong contrast with this was the mag- 
nanimous spirit of Lincoln, who, ' with malice 
toward none, with charity for all,' wished to 
' bind up the nation's wounds.' He wished 
the suffrage conferred upon the ' very intelli- 
gent ' colored people, but did not consider this 
an indispensable condition for readmission. 
Tbe debate as to whether the States were in 
or out of the Union he regarded as a senseless 
quibble. Nobody doubted that they were out 
of their proper relation to the Union. He 
summed up the situation in Louisiana by a 
homely illustration. Granting that the new 
government is only an egg, ' we shall sooner 
have the fowl by hatching the egg than by 
smashing it.' At his last cabinet meeting, he 
said : ^ I think it providential that this great 
rebellion is crushed just as Congress has ad- 
journed and there are none of the disturbing 
elements of that body to embarrass us. If we 
are wise and discreet we shall reanimate the 



States and get their governments- in successful 
operation, with order prevailing and the Union 
re-established, before Congress comes together 
in December." The failure of this plan in 
the hands of his successor, the author attrib- 
utes mainly to Johnson's lack of political 
sense. Lincoln himself probably would have 
had a fight with Congress, but his command- 
ing personality would have won on the main 
points. The so-called ' harsh legislation ' of 
the Southern States toward the negro, of which 
Blaine, ignorant of the fact that some of it 
was copied from the laws of Maine, made so 
much, is set forth in its proper light. The 
further story of Reconstruction, to appear in 
the next volume, will be awaited with much 
interest. 

This volume makes a distinct contribution 
to the history of its period, in the subjects of 
society at the North, prisoners of war, and 
perhaps on Sherman's march. Tlie copious 
citations in the foot-notes indicate a good use 
of source material. To the specialist, the 
work will appeal as authoritative until more 
evidence is forthcoming. The author has per- 
formed a distinct service in showing that a 
non-partisan account of our great Civil War 
need not be colorless. d^^id Y. Thomas. 



A 'Monistic Tkixity.'* 



The veteran professor of Jena gave us to 
understand that ' The Riddle of the Universe,' 
published in 1899, was his last book; but it 
had such a wide circulation, and raised so 
many questions, that the author felt obliged to 
prepare the work now under review, in order 
to make clearer his views on biological ques- 
tions and their relation to the monistic philoso- 
phy. Being quite unable to answer the letters 
— more than five thousand — addressed to him, 
or to acknowledge adequately the many docu- 
ments, flowers, and other gifts addressed to him 
on his seventieth birthday. Professor Haeckel 
gracefully begs his admirers to receive his new 
l)ook as an expression of his thanks, the best 
gift in return he is able to make. Perhaps, 
in recognition of the fact that this latest prod- 
uct shows no sign of diminishing vigor, we may 
still refuse to believe that Profassor Haeckel has 
retired from the stage; and may be allowed to 
remind him that another distinguished evolu- 
tionist. Dr. A. R. Wallace, though some fifteen 
years his^^enior, is still active. 

' The Wonders of Life ' is, of course, a little 
handbook of monism; that is to say, monism

according to Professor Haeckel. It is postu- 
lated that throughout the whole universe, * in 
every atom and every molecule/' are found three 
fundamental attributes: matter, force, and sen- 
sation. This is what Professor Haeckel him- 
self calls ' a monistic trinity,' a trimonism not 
less mysterious than that of the theologians. 

The scientific philosophers of the nineteenth 
century. Professor Haeckel and his contem- 
poraries, did a great service in unifying and 
therefore simplifying human thought. At the 
beginning of the century, facts were being re- 
corded rapidly, and it might have been expected 
that science would at length become a vast 
storehouse of miscellaneous information, quite 
beyond the power of man to utilize or compre- 
hend. In biology, there was the unceasing dis- 
covery of new species, some thousands of them 
described by Professor Haeckel himself; and 
of course this outpouring of new material has 
continued to the present day, yearly increasing 
in volume. Yet, notwithstanding all this, sci- 
ence becomes continually more intelligible and 
rational; the pattern of things is gradually 
made clear as hitherto missing parts are sup- 
plied; and, in short, we are daily more assured 
of the fundamental unity and harmony of the 
universe. Thus, in a sense, all scientific men 
are monists; all believe that their smallest con- 
tributions possess value for the very reason 
that they help toward an understanding of the 
totality of things, so far as this max be grasped 
by the human mind. 

In another sense, however, it may fairly be 
maintained that all sane men are dualists. 
The fundamental dualism is that of the I and 
the not-I ; our lives are made up of the actions 
and reactions between these two. Regarding 
tilings objectively, and as a mere matter of 
logic, it is possible to argue that our very con- 
sciousness is but a part of the nature of things, 
free will being no more inherent in human 
beings than in gases or crystals. This is really 
Professor Haeckel's position, and yet it is im- 
possible to read his very human work without 
a keen sense of his personality as a consciously 
free agent. There used to be at Maskelyne 
and Cook's, in London, an automaton which 
played chess, and was able, it was said, to beat 
nearly all comers. The proprietors of the de- 
vice declared that it was a mere mechanism, and 
indeed inspection seemed to preclude the possi- 
bility of someone being concealed within. 
N^evertheless, it was the general opinion that 
there was a free agent somewhere, and a clergy- 
man of my acquaintance, baffled in the attempt 
to furnish a more ordinary explanation, really 
believed that the conjurors were in league with 
the devil. In much the same way. we must be 
permitted to discount Professor Haeckel's assur- 



ance that even he himself is an automaton, — a 
mere result of blind preexisting causes, — leav- 
ing it, however, to our clerical friends to offer 
the diabolical hypothesis ! 

It is not fair to say that Professor Haeckel 
is unaware of this difficulty. He overcomes it, 
to his own satisfaction, by adding sensation to 
force and matter as a third universal attribute 
of being. There is the ' sensation ' of atoms, 
that is, the affinity of the elements in chemical 
combinations. The ' sensation ' of protoplasm 
is what is often spoken of as its ' irritability.' 
So passing upward through twelve defined 
stages, we reach the sensation of civilized man, 
producing the arts and sciences. This ' sensa- 
tion ' is one in the sense that force is one, and 
matter is one, and is indestructible in the same 
sense. Thus it is not necessary to postulate 
that the human consciousness is the outcome 
of any metamorphosis of matter or force; on 
the contrar}', this is denied, and it is said to 
lie merely the highest type of another universal 
attribute, ' sensation.' We reach a sort of pan- 
theism rather than atheism. 

It is likely to be claimed by materialistic 
monists, that this is giving away the whole 
monistic position ; that the ' monistic trinity ' 
is a contradiction in terms, notwithstanding 
Haeckel's arguments in its defense. It may be 
so, but that is merely a question of words, and 
it is much more interesting to investigate the 
merits of the Haeckelian doctrine than to dis- 
pute about its label. It is not very easy to 
understand what is meant by an unconscious 
sensation, though we are reminded of the pho- 
tographer's use of the word ' sensitive ' in con- 
nection with his plates, and of the chemist's 
'sensitive reaction.' At all events, letting the 
term pass, it is not shown that consciousness 
and sensation (in the Haeckelian sense) are the 
same thing, even in the sense that light and 
heat are the same. It is rather assumed be- 
cause philosophy requires it; and if one can- 
not so believe as a matter of faith, there is no 
resort to actual demonstration. 

Accepting the 'monistic trinity,' it does not 
seem to me that it is necessary to reject the 
immortality of the soul, or even a personal 
God. Professor Haeckel rejects these, but for 
other reasons; practically, because they seem 
to him totally unproved and unlikely. If 
' sensation ' is a universal attribute, and human 
consciousness is a phase of it, does it not seem 
reasonable to suppose that it reaches similarly 
high development in many places and wa3's in 
this vast universe ? That it should be otherwise, 
would seem as 'hnprobable as that elaborate 
chemical compounds or combinations of forces 
should be restricted to one or a very few places. 
This on the Haeckelian hypothesis, merely.

Two English Churchmen.* 



That the late Canon Liddon, highest of 
High Churchmen, strictest of ritualists, and 
so devoted a Puseyite as in some matters to 
out-Pusey his chief, will be to very many 
readers no congenial subject for contemplation 
and study, is of course at once to be taken for 
granted by the reviewer of his ' Life and Let- 
ters ' as prepared for publication by his inti- 
mate friend, the Rev. John Octavius Johnston. 
Yet the steadiness of purpose, the firmness of 
conviction, and the faithfulness to the truth 
as he saw it, which Liddon displayed in a life 
of singular consistency and unfaltering obedi- 
ence to the high call of duty, are such as to 
awaken the interests of even a listless reader 
and to challenge the admiration of however 
violent a dissenter from the eminent theolo- 
gian's doctrinal teachings. Mr. Johnston, whose 
pen has already been usefully employed in 
completing Liddon's unfinished 'Life of 
Pusey,' and who as principal of Cuddesdon 
Theological College, where Liddon served as 
vice-principal for five years in early manhood, 
must have had excellent opportunity to gather 
material for this later and scarcely less diffi- 
cult work, has presented a detailed and sym- 
pathetic study of Liddon's life and character. 

To us cis-Atlantic Anglo-Saxons, who are 
credited, not wholly unjustly, with more nerv- 
ous energy than enduring strength, with more 
strenuousness of purpose than calm confi- 
dence of reserve power, with a greater prone- 
ness to misapply force than to use it just 
where and when it will prove most effective, 
there is something at once engaging and in- 
structive in the well-ordered life and wisely 
directed activity — unhasting and unresting, 
duly observant of ancient conventions and en- 
joying in turn their unfailing aid and sup- 
port — of the well-born, well-endowed, uni- 
versity-educated Englishman, who early chooses 
his life work and, looking neither to right nor

to left, steadily advances, through easy grada- 
tions, to a position of eminence and distinc- 
tion and the fruition of appropriate and de- 
served honors and emoluments. Henry Parr}' 
Liddon's was exactly such a life of wisely 
economized energy and honestly earned suc- 
cess. He chose his calling in mere childhood, 
and thenceforward thought and action were 
guided and applied with sole reference to the 
contemplated end. As an infant, it was his 
favorite diversion to play at preaching, envel- 
oped in the ample folds of the ' Times ' news- 
paper. Except swimming, he took little part 
in boyhood's usual sports and games, but was 
accepted by his schoolmates as their spiritual 
mentor, and was recognized by them as one 
that dwelt apart in a world of purity and high 
ideals which even their unredeemed natures 
knew how to respect. Sermon-writing was 
one of his cherised amusements, and five of 
these discourses, composed at the age of four- 
teen, are still extant in a copy-book which he 
sent to his Aunt Louisa with the inscription, 
' My first attempts at sermons.' But we are 
relieved to learn that these early indications of 
unmitigated priggishness were offset by sundry 
qualities of healthy boy-nature. He is remem- 
bered for his courage in more than one youth- 
ful combat. ' I have seen him fight many a 
good fight and come out smiling,' writes one of 
his school-fellows. And a story is told of his 
frank request in open school, ' Please, sir, may 
I leave off learning Greek? I am sure I shall 
never understand it.' Plays, too, as well as 
sermons he was fond of writing, though he 
had never been inside a theatre; and one of 
these juvenile pieces, ' Napoleon,' * an his- 
torical drama rather than a tragedy,' exhibit- 
ing ' vices to be avoided rather than virtues to 
be imitated,' he and some of his schoolmates 
acted with success. The science of warfare, 
strangely enough, was also exceedingly inter- 
esting to the little preacher, who eagerly dis- 
cussed the details of Caesar's Gallic campaigns 
and Napoleon's battles. To Mr. Frederic Har- 
rison, as quoted by Mr. Johnston, we are in- 
debted for a pleasing portrait of the boy Lid- 
don; and as his boyhood and youth present 
more of general interest than the ecclesiastical 
and doctrinal discussions and disputes of later 
life, an extended extract from Mr. Harrison's 
reminiscences is here offered. 

'I sat beside Liddon more than fortj' years ago in 
the Sixth Form at King 's College School, for a year 
or two. He was three years my senior, and the gulf 
that exists from fourteen to seventeen among school- 
fellows is not easily passed. But I sat in form next 
to him, and as in the Sixth we did not change places, 
I was his daily companion, I was fond of all sorts 
of games; he of none. I read all sorts of books; he 
had even then his own fixed line of thought and of

study. He was much my senior, and very old for 
his years, so there was no kind of school intimacy 
between us. He always seemed to me an elder 
brother who wished the young ones were more seri- 
ous. But, different though our interests and habits 
were, I always found him friendly, gentle, and con- 
siderate. What was Canon Liddon like as a boy of 
seventeen? Well, so far as I can remember, he was 
at seventeen just what he was at twenty-seven, or 
thirty-seven, or forty-seven — sweet, grave, thought- 
ful, complete. ... To me, when I heard him 
preaching in St. Paul's, or heard him speak at 
Oxford of more recent years, he was just the same 
earnest, zealous, affectionate, and entirely other- 
world nature that I remember him at seventeen. 
The lines of his face may have deepened; the look 
may have become more anxious of late years; but 
as a schoolboy I always thought he looked just what 
he did as a priest. There was the same expression 
of sweet, somewhat fatherly, somewhat melancholy 
interest. He would reprove, exhort, advise boys just 
as a young priest does in his own congregation. We 
expected it of him. ... I do not think that he 
ever joined in any game or even looked on at any 
game; I am sure that he never took part in the 
rough-and-tumble horseplay common among boys; 
and I am certain he never returned a blow or a prac- 
tical joke at his expense. Nor had he any occasion 
to do so, for neither blows nor horseplay was evei 
practised upon Liddon. There was, I fancy, a kind 
of silent understanding that to treat Liddon rudely, 
even without intending it, would be unmanly, like 
striking a priest with his robes on.' 

A pleasing incident recorded in connection 
with Liddon's life at Oxford is his saving the 
life of his tutor at a summer reading party, 
William Stubbs, the future professor of mod- 
ern histwv and Bishop of Oxford. This good 
fortune he owed to his prowess as a swim- 
mer. 

To present in something like due propor- 
tion the varied qualities, admirable and not so 
admirable, of the man Liddon, — and not to 
dwell exclusively on his more amiable traits, — 
we must next touch on a few of those dis- 
tinctive characteristics that made him so well 
known as one of the leading and most un- 
compromising High Churchmen of his time. 
Appointed, soon after his graduation from 
Oxford, vice-principal of Bishop Wilberforce's 
newh'-established Cuddesdon Theological Col- 
lege, he there displayed ritualizing tendencies 
that soon got the school into hot water and 
ultimately necessitated his resignation. Here 
is a characteristic extract from his diary: 

'The Bishops of Glasgow and London have rep- 
resented to him [Wilberforce] in the strongest 
terms the necessity of making the chapel less 
"gaudy." Accordingly (1) the Cross has been 
removed; (2) the white and green Altar cloths are 
forbidden; (3) the painted figures on the wall are 
to be covered over; and (4) the celebrant is to 
stand at the end, not in front, of the Altar. This 
last change I feel to be the most important; it is 
doctrinal. The Bishops wish to abolish the early 
Communions ou Sundays, but these happily have 
been saved.' 



Seven years later we find him most ungra- 
cioush^ refusing to preach in Westminster Ab- 
bey because the invitation was extended to 
him by Dean Stanley, whose Broad-Church 
principles he disapproved; or, to put it more 
accurately, his refusal appears to have been 
due to the latitudinarianism both of Dean 
Stanley and also of the men — Maurice, Jowett, 
and others — who were asked, at the same 
time with him, to occupy the Abbey pulpit. 
This is the strain in which he justifies his 
declination : 

'You say, my dear Mr, Dean, that we refuse to 
preach in the same church with yourself. You will, 
I trust, forgive me for saying that Churchmen have 
hoped — hoped and prayed, hoped against hope — 
that one from whom so much might be expected, as 
j'ourself, would one day be with them. Even now 
we do not acquiesce in the miserable conviction 
that you have cast in your lot with men, like Colenso 
and others, who are labouring to destroy and blot 
out the Faith of Jesus Christ from the hearts of the 
English people. We still believe that your gener- 
osity, rather than your judgment, links you even to 
Mr. Maurice and Mr. Jowett. We are quite sure 
your love of truth, your sense of moral beauty, and 
in eminent degree your historical tastes and wide 
sympathies, link you to us, who cherish the move- 
ment of 1833-50, as to no other men in the English 
Church. You will, I trust, forgive the extreme 
freedom with which I have answered a letter, to 
which silence might have been the most respectful 
answer, if it had not been open to misunder- 
standing. ' 

This from a young man of thirty-four to the 
Very Eev. Dean of Westminster! How little 
he understood the other's ' wide sympathies ' ! 

Many matters, such as the ' Lux Mundi ' 
controversy, the ' Bampton Lectures,' the re- 
grettable agitation over Jowett's alleged 
heresy, Liddon's reply to lilartineau's ' Seat of 
Authority in Eeligion,' his friendly relations 
with Gladstone on the one hand and Salisbury 
on the other, his refusal to consider the offer 
of a bishopric at the request of either, his dis- 
tinction as a pulpit orator, and his famous 
sermons at Oxford, at St. Paul's, and else- 
where, might profitably be dwelt on by the 
reviewer, but must be dismissed with a bare 
mention and left to be enjoj'ed (or not) in 
their entirety by readers of the book. Turn- 
ing to the Bishop of Oxford's closing chap- 
ter, personal and eulogistic in character, we 
will extract a final passage which, picturing to 
us the mature man, will serve as companion 
piece to Mr. Harrison's pen portrait of the 
youth. After speaking of the far richer and 
nobler nature than betrayed itself in the 
numerous controversies that engaged his zeal, 
the writer, referring to Liddon's more inti- 
mate friends, continues: 

'They remember him as one who, possessing in 
extraordinary measure the gifts most perilous to 



236 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



simplicity and modesty, and so wielding those gifts 
that men of all sorts gathered round him in thou- 
sands and listened to him as to no other preacher, 
yet remained un marred by admiration and kept 
quite out of his heart all the degrading thoughts of 
what is called success; — remained apparently one 
of the least self-conscious of men, ready to enter 
with undivided interest into anything that was of 
real interest to others; as simply grateful as a child 
for the simplest kindness shown to him; never talk- 
ing about himself, nor talking as men do who, when 
they are silent, think much about themselves; and 
making others somehow feel that it would not do 
to talk to him as though they thought him remark- 
able or great. Something of that restraining influ- 
ence seems still to belong to the very thought and 
memory of him; it makes one hesitate (not in 
doubt, but in reverence) about venturing to give 
him the deep praise of humility and simplicity; but 
one can say that the constant tokens of a very hum- 
ble, simple heart were there, through all his exercise 
of splendid powers and all the tribute rendered him 
by men. ... It is hard to imagine any one 
talking much better than he did. The voice, the 
look, the manner, the perfect flexibility of tone; 
the phrases that summed up everything, the reti- 
cence that suggested more than any phrase; the ges- 
ture, or something less obtrusive than a gesture, 
which came in when any word would have been 
clumsy; the delicate enunciation that was always 
precise and never prim, that lent itself alike to 
earnestness and fun; — these were but the accessory 
graces of a mind rich with knowledge of all sorts, 
and swift to bring out the aptest thought, and of 
an imagination so vivid that every detail stood at 
once before it, so discerning that it saw at once the 
detail that meant most. Indeed, most minds, as 
they move in talking, appear to be rather lumbering 
things in comparison with what one can recall of 
him.' 

As an example of brilliant qualities of intel- 
lect and character, of sound scholarship and, 
his convictions being what they were, of clear 
thinking, of high endeavor and exalted ideals, 
of lofty moral courage and untiring energy, of 
quickening spiritual power and winning per- 
sonality, Liddon commands our cordial admi- 
ration; and to his faithful historian our 
thanks are due for a worthy addition to the 
literature of biography. 

By a curious coincidence, there appears, 
simultaneously with Liddon's life, the life, as 
told in his letters, of the man whom Liddon 
had the good fortune to rescue from an un- 
timely death, as already related. The two 
books serve in some degree to supplement each 
other. The picture we paint of a writer from 
reading his published works is more often than 
not widely at variance with the reality. It 
will cause some surprise to learn from Bishop 
Stubbs's letters, as edited and supplemented 
with explanatory matter by Mr. William 
Holden Hutton, that the learned historian of 
the English Constitution had a rare gift of 
humor, a keen wit, a geniality, sweetness, and 
charm, that not even the formalities of correct 



letter-writing could wholly disguise. Toil 
and learning, vast though they were in his 
case, need not, one is glad to see, quench the 
inborn spirit of merriment. The brightness 
and lightness of his fun, always under the 
most perfect control (for no man possessed a 
more admirable reserve), were delightfully in 
contrast with the notion of his pereonality as 
entertained by those who knew him only 
through his books. A few reminiscences of 
him contributed by Mr. James Bryce help to 
give a true conception of his winning pres- 
ence. That he was without vanity and that he 
found learning its own sufficient reward, is 
also made clear. His editor has gathered this 
volume of letters primarily because ' it was 
felt that later times might well have cause 
to complain if they should be able to learn as 
little about the life of the great English his- 
torian of the Nineteenth Century as we are 
able to know of Bishop Butler.' It is to be 
hoped that, faithfully as Mr. Hutton has exe- 
cuted his task, — and his interspersed matter is 
illuminative and indispensable to the best en- 
joyment of the letters, — that a fuller, more 
formal biography of Bishop Stubbs may some 
day be written. Among the best letters must 
bo named the frequent missives, by no means 
always so dry and tough as our historian's 
Charters, to E. A. Freeman and J. E. Green. 
Of the desipere in loco Stubbs was a master, 
at least in his correspondence. The following, 
from a letter to Freeman, contains a delicious 
hit at that historian's pedantic insistence on 
the use of Anglo-Saxon forms: 

'A horrid thought has just penetrated to what 
my friends are pleased to call my brain — that I 
have had two missives from you, and have answered 
neither. I am, in fact, rather languid after the 
production of my book. However, neither I nor 
Boase either, know or believe anything about 
Thierry's speech of Henry I., and about the veto I 
know nothing, and Boase only knows that it was 
the result of some diplomatic juggling in the time 
of Hlodowigh XIV.' 

Eeferring on his first page to the * great 
school ' that ' arose in the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, which embodied and expressed 
the enthusiasm of the time for an ordered 
study of the past,' the editor declares that ' of 
the workers in that school the greatest was 
William Stubbs.' What rank then, some will 
ask, shall we assign to his great contemporary 
(and senior by two years) and successor in 
the chair of modern history at Oxford? But 
the quality of a biographers panegyric is not, 
and should not be, strained. Both reader 
and writer delight to dwell in fond remem- 
brance on the prowess of a deceased hero.

Recext Books about Music* 



Some years ago, at the end of a long and ani- 
mated discussion with that profound and some- 
times illogical thinker, John Ruskin, when 
asked for a definition of art, W. J. Stillman 
replied : * The harmonic expression of human 
emotion.' Elaborating on this definition, he 
afterwards pointed out that science — knowl- 
edge — is common to all men, and invariable ; it 
is in the emotional nature that men differ; the 
character of the emotion is that of the indi- 
vidual, and it is this which gives tone and char- 
acter to the art, which determines the artist, 
and imposes itself on all the judgments and 
criticisms of his art as the element that gives 
precedence. Art is therefore, in the last reduc- 
tion, the proclamation of individuality; and 
the stamp of the art is that of the individuality, 
nature furnishing merely the pabulum. In her 
book entitled ' Makers of Song,* Miss Amra. 
Alice Chapin has endeavored to indicate the 
men who have in the most marked degree influ- 
enced the development of song. She points out 
that the development of music, and especially of 
lyric music, has been a matter of such subtle 
and slow gradation that the task of particular- 
izing and enumerating and selecting the domi- 
nant factors in the progress has presented many 
difficulties; but if the sign-posts pointed out 
should lead some student into a more compre- 
hensive understanding of the history of song 
than it has been the author's privilege to 
achieve, the aim of the book will have been 
fulfilled. Beginning with the twelfth century, 
the days of Bemart de Yentadom, of Eegnault 
de Coucy, of John of Fornsete — who gave the 
world the earliest piece of harmonic music, 
' Sumer is icumen in,' — through the days of 
the Minnesinger of Germany, with the Casta- 
nets, she passes on to the years of Pierre Gued- 
ron, teacher of kings and master of the seven- 
teenth century chanson and romance in France, 
and of StradeUa and PurceU. In regard to 
such departures as the inclusion of such men 
as LuUy, StradeUa, and John of Fornsete, the 
author feels that she will require no justifica- 
tion beyond a careful study of the works of 
these composers and of the lyrical productions 
imm ediately following their periods of activity.

Miss Chapin's work is both statistical and nar- 
rative, and her well- written story of the origin 
of song will be read with interest. 

It has been said of Dr. Daniel Gregory 
Mason that he often ' expresses what one has 
felt, but never quite formulated.' His first 
work, ' From Grieg to Brahms,' was commended 
for its succinctness, clearness, and gracefulness 
of expression. His latest work, ' Beethoven and 
his Forerunners,' displays that firm grasp of 
the subject which makes it interesting as well 
as valuable reading for the student. It opens 
with a chapter on ' The Periods of Musical His- 
tory,' touches upon ' Palestrina and the Music 
of Mysticism ' and ' The Principles of Pure 
Music,' followed by biographical and critical 
studies of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. In 
conclusion he says: 

'As we glance over the life of Beethoven, and 
over that larger Ufe of the art of music in the 
classical period of which it was the final stage, we 
cannot but be profoundly impressed hj the unity 
and continuity of the whole evolution. From ita 
first slight and tentative beginnings in the experi- 
ments of the Florentine reformers, secular music — 
the art of expressing through the medium of tones 
the full, free, and harmonious emotional life of 
modern idealism — gradually acquired, through the 
labors of the seventeenth century composers, defin- 
iteness of aim and technical resources. Then In 
the work of Haydn and Mozart it reached the 
stage of maturity, of self-consciousness; it became 
flexible, various, many-sided, adequate to the 
demands made upon it; it emerged from childhood 
and took its honored place in the circle of inde- 
pendent and recognized arts. Finally, it was 
brought by Beethoven to its ripe perfection, its 
full flowering. It was made to say all that, within 
its native limitations, it was capable of saying. It 
reached the fulness of life beyond which it could 
live only by breaking itself up into new types, as 
the old plant scatters forth seeds. And even then, 
these new types were dimly divined, and suggested 
to his successors by Beethoven. Was it not hia 
effort to express, in absolute music, the most various 
shades of personal, highly specialized feeling, vig- 
orous, sentimental, mystical, or elfishly wayward, 
that inspired the romantic composers, Schubert, 
Schumann, Chopin, and their feUows, to pursue 
even further the same quest? Was it not his 
feeling out toward novel dramatic effects in the 
combined chorus and orchestra, in the Ninth Sym- 
phony, that showed Wagner the path he must taket' 

There is a chord of sincerity in all that Dr. 
Mason writes; and while he is never pedantic, 
his work shows remarkable insight into the 
origin and development of musical works. 

Mr. W. J. Henderson's work entitled ' Mod- 
em Musical Drift' is divided into six parts, 
namely, ' Parsifalia,' ' Der Ring des Xibelun- 
gen,' 'Isolde's Serving Woman,' * Richard 
Strauss,' * Aux Italiens,' and ' The Oratorio of 
Today.' A number of these chapters have been 
previously published in contemporary period- 
icals and papers. Keen in diagnosis and crit-

dice, Mr. Henderson never hesitates to call a 
spade a spade; and while one cannot always 
agree with him, he cannot but admire the 
trenchant way in which the critic gives expres- 
sion to his views and opinions. 

' So weave your fancies ; I'll weave mine ; 

And let them wander, dark or bright. 
The Lords of Art have graven fine ; 

Perchance we both discern aright.' 

Speaking of the oratorio of today, Mr. Hender- 
son points out that Sir Edward Elgar's style 
belongs entirely to the present; that his poly- 
phony is built on a harmonic basis which almost 
completely ignores the ecclesiastic tonalities of 
the earlier church writers, and utilizes the 
diatonic and chromatic scheme of the present, 
the method of Wagner's ' Tristan und Isolde.' 
And while he is credited with oratorio quite as 
dramatic as Tinel's, but saved from mere the- 
atricalism by the artistic discretion of the com- 
poser, the thing itself is considered anomalous, 
because the narrator becomes an imperative 
necessity and oratorio now demands scenic rep- 
resentation and that is forbidden. 

'The oratorio of today tends steadily toward the 
completion of a cycle. It started from the primi- 
tive religious play of Cavaliere, and through the 
development of the method of choral composition 
reached a point at which all conception of action 
disappeared. From that point it has been slowly 
and surely moving around to the restoration of 
the dramatic element, till now it stands once more 
at the very threshold of the theatre. In its present 
form it is an absurdity. Even the singers find it 
almost impossible to sing the oratorios of the new 
sort without putting at least facial expression into 
their work, and every one of them looks solemnly 
conscious of the foolishness of evening dress. 
Mr. Elgar's interpretation makes Judas Iscariot 
altogether too realistic for a white waistcoat, and 
his Mary Magdalen in a Princess gown with kid- 
gloved arms is a portrait which would make Henner 
gasp and Kuskin stare.' 

In ' Phases of Modern Music,' Mr. Lawrence 
Gilman has written in a trenchant way of cer- 
tain phases of present-day music. The author 
is endowed with grace of style, and he knows 
how to bring into relief the interesting features 
of unattractive subjects. Among the subjects 
treated are Eichard Strauss, who is adjudged 
' an artist of profound and just convictions, the 
most penetrant and sympathetic of humanists ' ; 
Edward MacDowell, the composer, ' a romantic 
of the finer order ' ; Edward Elgar, whose 
* Dream of Gerontius ' has been declared the 
finest musical work since Wagner, but which 
the present author declares owes its extreme 
and affecting eloquence to Wagner. Wagner, 
Verdi, Mascagni, Loeflfler, and Grieg are also 
touched upon with discrimination, vividness, 
and spirit. In the essay on ' Woman and Mod- 
em Music,' Mr. Gilman answers in the nega- 
tive the question, ' Has Woman ever done 
greatly in creative music ? ' In conclusion, he 



adds a few pertinent words to the fast accumu- 
lating bibliography on the ' Parsifal ' contro- 
versy. 

'It is undeniable that in "Parsifal" Wagner has 
not written with the torrential energy, the superbly 
prodigal invention, which went to the creation of 
his earlier works; he is not here, unquestionably, 
so compelling and forceful, so overwhelming in 
vitality and climacteric power, as in the exuberant 
masterpieces of his artistic prime. But never 
before, on the other hand, had this master of 
illusion shaped such haunting and subtle symbols 
of suffering and lamentation, of sadness and terror, 
of pity and aspiration.' 

A unique handbook to the music of Chopin 
has been compiled by Mr. G. C. Ashton Jon- 
son. It is a sort of a ' musical Baedeker,' made 
particularly useful through modern conditions. 
' Three years ago,' says the author, ' this book 
could only have met with a very limited de- 
mand, owing to the fact that the numl>er of 
amateurs possessed of sufficient technique to play 
Chopin's music (for the most part extremely 
difficult) is very small. But today, owing to 
the invention of the pianola and the fact that 
all Chopin's works, including even the least im- 
portant of the posthumous compositions, are 
now available for that instrument, the whole 
domain of his music is for the first time open 
to all.' It has been the author's aim to make 
his book equally useful and helpful to concert- 
goers, for whom it forms a permanent analytical 
programme, to pianists, and to those amateurs 
of music who can now, owang to the pianola, 
pursue for the first time a systematic and co- 
ordinated study of Chopin's works. Comments 
from newspaper articles have been grouped un- 
der the opus numbers of the works to which 
they refer. In addition, a brief account is given 
of each composition, its relative place among 
Chopin's works, and notes of any special points 
of interest attaching to it. A chronological 
table is included, and the compilation of the 
approximate dates of the compositions enables 
one to study the development of the composer's 
individuality. Tlie volume opens with a brief 
sketch of Chopin's life, which is followed by 
short preliminary chapters on various aspects 
of his work. A perusal of Mr. Jonson's book 
will increase the artistic pleasure to be ob- 
tained from the intelligent study of this master 
of his class — for in Chopin the romantic school 
found its highest expression. 

In similar vein to her ' Stories of the Wag- 
ner Operas ' and ' Stories of Famous Operas,' 
Miss H. A. Guerber has now given us a volume 
of ' Stories of Popular Operas,' in which are 
traced the stories of the librettos of 'William 
Tell,' ' L'Africaine,' ' Der Freischiitz,' 'The 
Magic Fhite,' ' Eigoletto,' 'Othello,' ' Fra 
Diavolo,' ' L'Elisire D'Amore,' ' Romeo and 
Juliet,' ' I Pagliacci,' ' La Tosca,' and ' Le

Prophete.' As explained by the author, the 
object of these stories is to enable the reader to 
follow the motions of the singers, and, even if 
unfamiliar with the langnage in which the 
opera is given, to have a fair idea of the mean- 
ing of what is said and done. The author has 
studied her subjects with enthusiasm and fidel- 
ity, and with singular thoroughness.

Briefs ox New Books. 

A great Western Mr. William M. Meigs's 'Life of 
statesman and Thomas Hart Benton' (Lippin- 
expansionist. cott) is the first critical estimate 
of the great Westerner and his proper place in 
history. Benton's life is traced with painstaking 
detail, through the early years in North Carolina 
and Tennessee to the fulness of his fame as Sen- 
ator from Missouri. There is an especially good 
chapter on life in the West, which furnishes a 
backgi'ound for a study of the leader who was 
above all an exponent of the Western spirit and 
therefore of nationalism; for the West alone was 
not sectional but national. The political career 
of Benton is treated topically; thus we have set 
forth his opinions and activities on the Salt Tax, 
the Land Laws, the Tariff, Expansion, Slavery, 
the Bank, Oregon and Texas, the Compromise of 
1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska agitation. Of the 
personal and intimate side of his character, little 
is told, and what is told is not of a nature to 
increase one's admiration for the man. Possi- 
bly Mr. Meigs, who is an admirer of Benton, did 
not see that the effect of his treatment of his 
hero's character is to make the latter appear 
vain, egotistical, intolerant, prejudiced, and often 
vulgar. All these Benton certainly was in some 
degree ; but the impression gained from the pages 
of Mr. Meigs is probably somewhat unfair to the 
subject. The author does show us, however, that 
in broad-minded patriotism the Senator from 
Missouri was the superior of most of his con- 
temporaries. Ambition never led him to truckle 
to the popular feeling of the hour, nor did the 
unpopularity of a cause make him forsake it. His 
life covered the whole expansion of the republic, 
and no man better understood the meaning of 
that expansion or foresaw more clearly the dan- 
gers involved in the rapid g^rowth of the country. 
He opposed anti-slavery agitation and the result- 
ing pro-slavery agitation. His homestead land- 
policy would have settled the question of slavery 
in the territories; his plan for tariff revision 
would have eased what he considered the worst 
injustice to the South. The author is wrong in 
describing Benton as Southern in his sympathies; 
he was a true exponent of the Western spirit, and 
failed to understand the position of the South as 
completely as he did that of the East. He 
'thought continentally,* and believed that all who 
thought differently were wrong, dishonorable, in- 
triguing, and traitorous. In few, if any, points 
does the biographer differ from the views of Ben- 



ton. Like him, he is suspicious of the East and of 
the South, has a low opinion of the opponents of 
Benton, believes still in the stoi-ies of the intrigues 
of politicians and statesmen for the purpose of 
shaping the course of national policy. His own 
appreciation of the Western spirit of expansion 
should at this late date make him understand that 
Texas and the far West were annexed, not because 
of, but in spite of, the desire of pro-slavery 
leaders, and that had it not been for slavery the 
annexation would probably have come earlier. The 
sketch here given of the evolution of the South- 
west, then known as the West, is very satisfac- 
tory. The character of the settlers, the methods 
of settlement, the land system, the pioneer life, 
the political and economic conditions of the set- 
tlements in the Mississippi valley,— all these are 
well described. The author rightly emphasizes 
the fact that the Southwest was settled without 
the aid of the central government, that it suffered 
from the jealousy of the East and profited Jby the 
friendship of the South from whence most of its 
settlers came. On the other hand, the Northwest 
was won for the Union by the South and South- 
west, and was settled under the protection of the 
United States army, principally by people from 
the East, from the jealousy of which it suffered 
but little. The author has consulted most of the 
available authorities on Benton, and has gath- 
ered much material from hitherto unknown 
sources. The work is the best life of Benton yet 
produced. 

New studies The strongest sentiments of Pe- 

of Petrarch trarch 's heart, and the varied pas- 

and Laura. gj^ng and impulses of his mind 

and soul while under the spell of Laui-a's influ- 
ence, have been revealed in the spirit of scien- 
tific research rather than that of poetic interpre- 
tation in 'The Secret of Petrarch,' by Mr. 
Edmund James Mills (Button). The volume is 
the work of a literary scholar of analytic type 
who has turned his lenses upon certain disputed 
points in the lives of the lovers, and has brought 
forward varied proofs to attest his own theories 
regarding Laura's birthplace, marriage, last ill- 
ness, and other details. Beneath the scholar's 
zeal is submerged, at times, that romantic and 
elusive atmosphere which should ever surround 
this record of poetic love. The detailed diagnosis 
of Laura's disease, couched in terms of modern 
surgery, causes a shiver of revulsion. There are, 
however, compensating passages of charming ap- 
preciation and concise summary. The prose 
studies examine the vexed questions of Laura's 
personaJity, her home and burial-place. Mr. 
Mills contends that her birthplace and home were 
at Pieverde, hard by Caumont, and not at Avig- 
non; this conclusion he attests by liberal, if not 
excessive, citations. With equal assurance he tes- 
tifies that Laura was no high-born matron of the 
De Sade family, but a lowly country-maid, 'a 
white rose born in harsh briars.' The metrical 
portion which follows these studies is compiled 
from varied parts of Petrarch's vei-se, using, in 
the main, the texts of Seartazzini, Carducci, and 
Ferrari, with a few new renderings as in 'Love's

Obsession,' 'Love's Missioner,' and 'Of Laura's 
Eyes.' Nearly all the passages are chosen to 
support the claims advanced in the author's prose 
studies. Some of the lines thus used seem 
strained in purpose; and, in spite of the accu- 
mulation of references and quotations, the reader 
can hardly accept all the author's conclusions. 
After all has been said pro and con, it is not 
Laura's birthplace or her daily tasks, not her 
fatal illness or the location of her tomb, that 
vitally interest us of to-day: it is her perennial 
charm and noble womanhood, so often portrayed 
by her poet-lover. 

' Good, too, she was, 
And never trivial ; showing in that sense 
Of heaven and holiness which sits so well 
On any woman. Yet she had sportive ways, 
And was most keen of mind ; her intellect 
Matched well her heart. White, slender hands she had. 
And dainty little figure, and fair feet. 
And grand magnificence of golden hair.' 

The volume is illustrated with a few photograv- 
ures of rare excellence, depicting shrines at Pie- 
verde, Sorga, and elsewhere, visited by the author 
in 1901. 

'It must be conceded,' as Colonel 
TLnl^.'' Higginson has well said, 'that 

John Brown was the most eloquent 
of all our great Abolitionists, for his was the elo- 
quence of a life. ' Something of this eloquence of 
action belongs also to those who took part with 
him in the stirring events attending the settle- 
ment of Kansas; and one of these participants 
was Dr. J. W. Winkley, whose little book, 'John 
Brown the Hero' (James H. West Co.) gives 
some highly interesting personal reminiscences 
of those days and of the man whose name they 
must always recall. In approaching a book of 
this character, a record of heroic deeds and of no 
less heroic sufferings, the reviewer feels himself 
disarmed of criticism except as to mere matters 
of historic accuracy; and in this instance the 
writer deals with only a few and in themselves 
insignificant occurrences, hitherto un chronicled in 
any detail, and known now only to himself and a 
very few besides. Mr. Sanborn has given in his 
life of John Brown a succinct account of the chief 
event related, and he says of it, in an introduc- 
tion that he furnishes to Dr. Winkley 's narra- 
tive,— 'But it required a fuller statement; espe- 
cially since it seems largely to have escaped the 
notice of the chroniclers of that disturbed and 
confused period of 1856. The partisan move- 
ment here described came in between two of 
Brown's famous fights,— that of Black Jack, in 
early June, when he captured the Virginian cap- 
tain, Pate, and that in the end of August, when 
he repelled the formidable attack of the Mis- 
sourians upon the small settlement of Osawato- 
mie.' Not the least interesting part of the book 
is the account of the boy Winkley 's adventures in 
his repeated trips to Kansas City, usually alone, 
to get supplies for the small settlement where he 
and an elder brother lived. By his occult power 
of 'localization' he drove his ox-team unerringly 
across the trackless prairie, meeting with sundiy 
exciting adventures on the way. Although the 
matter of the book is slender in amount, and 



spread thin by both author and printer, and 
although the glimpses we get of John Brown are 
few and fleeting, the publishers are still within 
the truth in announcing that 'the book has the 
interest of a romance,' and that 'the young will 
read it as if it were especially "a story for 
boys," and the old will find in it matters to revive 
their enthusiasm.' 

Hawthorne ^^^ addresses and letters deliv- 

redivivus. ^^^d and read at the Hawthorne 

commemoration of July 4 to 7 
at Concord last summer have been published by 
Messrs. Houghton, MiflBin & Co. under the title, 
'The Hawthorne Centenary Celebration.' Colonel 
Higginson, who presided the first day, has edited 
the volume, and besides a frontispiece portrait of 
Hawthorne the book has six views in and about 
the Wayside, at Concord. Among these excellent 
presentations of various phases of the great 
romancer's genius and personality, perhaps the 
freshest and most suggestive is Mr. Charles Fran- 
cis Adams's discussion of 'Hawthorne's Place in 
Literature, ' — fresh and suggestive because the 
speaker is a man of action even more than a man 
of letters. Yet he says dozens of things that 
excite protest and contradiction. He calls Thack- 
eray's style labored —Thackeray who prided 
himself on writing the fluent, unstudied, some- 
times even careless English of a gentleman; and 
of Thackeray's characters these are the seven Mr. 
Adams selects as typical and likely to survive,— 
'Becky Sharp, Major Pendennis, and Morgan, 
masterpieces all, with Colonel Newcome, Captain 
Costigan, Barry Lyndon, and Esmond, in the sec- 
ond rank.' Will one reader out of a hundred read- 
ily recall Major Pendennis 's valet, and will one 
out of a thousand place him before Colonel New- 
come and Barry Lyndon as masterpieces of char- 
acter-creation? Of familiar types to be found in 
American imaginative literature, Mr. Adams finds 
but three,— Rip Van Winkle, Topsy, and Colonel 
Starbottle; though on the last day of the celebra- 
tion he adds a fourth, Evangeline. While the 
army is receiving honors, has not Colonel Sellers 
a right to feel aggrieved at being neglected? In 
his treatment of Hawthorne's works, Mr. Adams 
amazes us by naming 'Our Old Home' as 'that 
one of his productions which the world would 
least willingly let die.' To the prevalent mania 
for complete editions, editions that suffer no 'pot- 
boiling rag' to escape, he administers a merited 
rebuke. Of the more studied essays in the vol- 
i.ime, Mr. Copeland's, Mr. Conway's, and Mr. 
Frank Preston Stearns's deserve especial notice. 
Mr. Sanborn's account of 'The Friendships of 
Hawthorne ' is excellent, but perhaps unduly long 
from the inclusion of some not indispensable 
details. The book is a worthy memorial of an 
important event in our literary annals.

Newberry and John Garstang, who have done 
such commendable work on Egyptian soil and in 
the publication of their 'finds,' have jointly 
written *A Short History of Ancient Egypt' 
(Dana Estes & Co.). It is a modest little work 
of 200 pages, but is full of the ripest fruit of the 
labors of its industrious authors in their explora- 
tion and decipherment of the Egyptian monu- 
ments. It gives a bird 's-eye view of the monarchy, 
from its founding down to its disintegration at 
least 3,000 years afterward. The style of the 
work is such as to carry the reader along at a 
rapid pace, and to give him merely sketch-lines of 
the great figures that loom up in each period or 
dynasty through that long stretch of time. The 
archaic or first period is naturally most full, for 
it is in just that period that some of the most 
startling discoveries have been made within the 
last decade. This formerly pre-historic and 
mythical period now steps up and takes its place 
in the regular and undisputed line of historical 
facts, and thus wipes out with one stroke the 
former incredulous statements regarding it. We 
are sorry to see that no new light of any conse- 
quence is found on the little known Hyksos 
period, and that its centuries of silence must still 
remain mute. In the appended 'Chronological 
Table' a safe method is adopted in putting the 
'Founding of the Monarchy' 'before 3000 B. C 
In fact, no dates are stated specifically until the 
reign of Thotmes III., 1515-1460 B. C. The long 
reign of Rameses II. is set at 1325-1258. After 
this, the next specific date is made at 930, when 
'Shishank captures Jerusalem.' Such a book as 
this, carefully read, will lead the student to larger 
and more comprehensive works on this most fas- 
cinating of ancient lands and peoples. 



Memorials of The extremes of credulity, super- 
a once famous stition, and narrowness, on the 
tea-port. qj^q hand, and broad-minded intel- 

ligence and liberality, on the other, were curi- 
ously mingled in the historic old town of Salem, 
Massachusetts. From the first set of qualities 
sprang the witchcraft delusion, with its harvest 
of innocent lives sacrificed to the popular frenzy; 
to the second the cause of tolerance and enlight- 
enment in religion is indebted, Salem having 
early and in a most emphatic manner joined the 
New England movement for wider liberty in 
matters theological. That these opposite ten- 
dencies developed themselves in one and the 
same small community, seems strange at first, but 
is not inexplicable. The superstitious habit of 
mind of a sea-faring folk may serve largely to 
explain the witchcraft atrocities, while the ex- 
tended acquaintance with the world gained by 
the sea-captains and sailors of Salem in their 
voyages to India and China and other distant 
lands, must have opened their eyes to the nai*- 
rowness of New England Puritanism. These 
thoughts are suggested by reading Mr. Charles E. 
Trow's 'Old Shipmasters of Salem' (Putnam), a 
book containing much curious and interesting 
matter, collected from log-books, shipmasters' 
journals, local newspapers, and other obscure 
sources, and served up with a generous pictorial 



accompaniment. Sea-yams and more weighty 
historical items mingle pleasantly in Mr. Trow's 
pages, which are heartily commended to all who 
like to read about those that go down to the sea 

in ships. ^___ 

The charm There was no Frenchman of let- 

0/ Renan ters in the last half of the nine- 

xn his letters. ^^^j^^^ century who had a more 
interesting personality than Ernest Renan. His 
tangential relation to Christianity, as it blossomed 
out in the French Catholic church ; his interest in 
religion in general, and in the life of Jesus in 
particular; his strong utterances on the political 
and social issues of his day,— aU these elements 
of his mind made him an unusually entertaining 
talker and writer. His most intimate friend in 
Paris was the famous chemist Berthelot. These 
two men so thoroughly agreed and sympathized 
that they readily confided to each other their 
thoughts on many of the great issues of their day. 
Some of Renan 's best letters to Berthelot have 
been gathered up and published in translation 
under the title, 'Letters from the Holy Land' 
(Doubleday, Page & Co.). They were written 
from more than a score of places outside the Holy 
Land,— Venice, Tripoli, Athens, Paris, Alexan- 
dria, and many smaller places. The essential 
thing, however, is that they are Renan 's, and 
show what his attitude was toward the national, 
religious, and intellectual agitations of his times, 
stretching as they do over a period of forty-five 
years, from 1847 to July 20, 1892, the last letter 
written by his own hand. They breathe the spirit 
of one who has enlisted in the cause of liberty of 
thought and action, with slight regard for tradi- 
tion, or for positions whose chief defense is that 
they are hoary with age. The tenderness of 
R'Cnan's heart and the freedom of his mind are 
two features that appear prominently in these 
charmingly written confidential letters. 

A convict's Mankind is put upon sorrowful

Sing' (Bobbs-Merrill Co.), written by one who 
preserves a partial anonymity by his nom de 
plume of 'Number 1500.' It is not a pleasant 
book, or is its manner much pleasanter than its 
matter, since it makes evident the fact that the 
criminal of to-day is rather the man in 'hard 
luck' than one guilty of any extraordinary moral 
turpitude as distinguished from the hundreds 
that go upwhipped of justice. It sets forth, also, 
the complete uselessness to the community of the 
lives led by those in New York's most notorious 
penitentiary, and the complete failure there to 
induce the inmates to effect any reform in their 
indivdual points of view that would lead to the 
betterment of the race. On the other hand, it 
points out the extraordinary value of the services 
rendered by Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth through 
the Volunteers' Prisoners' League, which has 
led more convicts into substantial accord with 
respectability since its institution in 1896 than all

keeper of the prison as a rule is not the sort of

that little or nothing is done inside the prison 
walls that could have a deterrent effect upon any 
person fairly embarked on a criminal career. 
There is no probing to the depths to account for

stories of the Mr. Frank T. Bullen 's recent vol- 
lives of some ume, * Denizens of the Deep, ' 

sea-creatures. (Revell), is not a continuous 
story, but 'a. series of lives of some Denizens 
of the Deep, based very lai-gely on personal ob- 
servation, buttressed by scientific facts, and 
decorated by imagination.' The author 'has 
wished to keep the work as unlike an orthodox 
natural history as it was possible to make it.' — 
as unlike, that is, in point of dulness and didac- 
ticism; and he has succeeded. His vigorous love 
of the sea is as patent here as in his previous 
books, and his healthful insistence on the hap- 
piness of the sea creatures is more convincing 
than ever. Although he is careful to remind us 
that we know very little of the depths of the 
sea, he often Avrites as if he had himself visited 
them. His stories of the various species of whale 
are most ample in knowledge, since whales are 
his specialty; but in telling of other 'denizens' 
also,— and few land-lubbers would guess there 
were as many as he describes,— his imagination 
works with a vividness that amounts to per- 
sonal identification. For justice, his chapter on 
the shark is most noteworthy. 'The Shark eats 
man,' he says, 'not because he loves man to eat, 
but because man when he falls overboai'd is usu- 
ally easy to get. If the man be a good noisy 
swimmer, no Shark will venture near, for they 
are, though tormented with hunger, a most nerv- 
ous and timid race, and, indeed, always seem to 
me to lose a great many opportunities through 
diffidence.' For pity, the chapter on the seal is 
most memorable. 'For my part, I shall never 
forget Bum-Murdoch's ci*y of hon-or in his book, 
"Edinburgh to the Antartic," where he speaks of 
the newly flayed Seal lifting itself redly to- 
Avard heaven in the glowing sunshine, as if ask- 
ing its Maker why this thing should be.' For 
romance, the story of the Stormy Petrel is most 
suggestive. The least satisfactory chapter is that 
on Sea-serpents ; but who that follows truth could 
write satisfactorily of them ?

Sons. The text and illustrations remain unchanged.

don Clarke, the recently-appointed director of the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, is contributed by Mr. 
John Lane to the April issue of ' The International 
Studio. ' 

'Author and Printer,' a guide for authors, print- 
ers, editors, and proofreaders, has been compiled by 
Mr. F. Howard Collins, and will be published imme- 
diately by Mr. Henry Frowde for the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. 

' Our First Century, ' by Mr. George Gary Eggleston, 
will be published shortly by Messrs. Barnes & Co.

ican Life,' a copiously illustrated record of man- 
ners and customs in the United States.

which lately took over the publishing business of 
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co., will bring out imme- 
diately a new story by 'Max Adeler' (Mr. Charles 
Heber Clark), called 'The Quakeress.' 

The 'Little Giant Question Settler,' published by 
Messrs. Laird & Lee, provides in convenient vest- 
pocket form a surprising amount of practical and 
evidently reliable information on a great variety of 
subjects. The arrangement is alphabetical. 

Mr. John Lane announces a new volume from the 
Eragny Press, under the title 'French and English 
Ballads.' The book will be printed in red and 
black throughout, with music type especially cut. 
The editing is in the hands of Mr. Robert Steele. 

The Harpers are bringing out a new revised edi-

spondent whose recent contributions to the period- 
ica] press have attracted much interest. 

A beautiful photogravure of Whistler's 'At the 
Piano' forms the frontispiece of 'The Burlington 
Magazine ' for March. The picture accompanies an 
account of the recent Whistler memorial exhibition, 
written by Mr. Bernhard Siekert. An article on 
the famous Ascoli Cope is contributed to the same 
number by Miss May Morris, a daughter of William 
Morris. 

The 'Life, Letters, and Literary Remains' of the 
late John Henry Shorthouse, in two volumes, is 
announced for spring publication by the Macmillan 
Co. The memoir, written by Mrs. Shorthouse, con-

well-known men of his day. The second volume

'My Appeal to America,' by M, Charles Wagner, 
is a booklet containing the French pastor's first 
address given to an American audience. It has an 
introduction by the Eev. Lyman Abbott, and is 
published by Messrs. MeClure, Phillips & Co. 

A new and somewhat cheapened edition of 'The 
American Revolution,' by Sir George Otto Tre- 
velyan, has been published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. The work is in three volumes, the 
first of which has been considerably re-arranged 
and re-written. 

'The Trial of Jesus,' by Giovanni Bosadi, a work 
that has attracted wide attention in Italy and Ger- 
many, will be published this month by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. in Dr. Emil Beich's English transla- 
tion. The author, a Florentine lawyer, condemns 
the trial of Jesus by the standard of Koman law. 

The editors of the Cambridge Modern History 
now announce that after the issue of Volume XII. 
the narrative will be supplemented by the publica- 
tion of a volume of maps and a final volume con- 
taining the genealogies and other auxiliary infor- 
mation, with a general index to the entire work. 

A timely addition to the 'Old South Leaflets' 
series has just been made in the account of Com- 
modore Perry's landing in Japan, reprinted from 
the ofiicial report published by order of Congress in 
1856. It is peculiarly interesting at this time to 
read of this first stej> in the opening of Japan to 
general relations with the Western world. 

The tasteful and inexpensive series of 'Popular 
Editions of Recent Fiction,' published by Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co., is augmented by four new 
volumes, containing 'The Heroine of the Strait' 
and 'Love Thrives in War,' by Mrs. Mary Catherine 
Crowley, 'Barbara' by Mr. John H. Whitson, and 
'A Girl of Virginia' by Mrs. Lucy M. Thruston. 

Professor George H. Palmer's definitive three- 
volume edition of George Herbert's works, an- 
nounced for early publication by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co., has been postponed until next autumn. 
The same publishers also report that the one-volume 
'Cambridge' edition of Byron's works, edited by 
Mr. Paul E. More, will not be ready for publication 
until September or October. 

The Oxford Clarendon Press has published 'The 
Complete Poetical Works of Shelley,' edited by 
Mr. Thomas Hutchinson. It is a volume of more 
than a thousand pages, with a portrait, a preface, 
many notes, and all of the poet's 'ascertained 
poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto 
appeared in print.' It is an immense satisfaction 
to have this carefully-edited text complete in a 
single volume. 

Four new volumes, dealing respectively with 
Paola Veronese, Bume-Jones, Van Dyck, and Watts, 
have recently made their appearance in the admira- 
ble ' Xewnes 's Art Library, ' published by Messrs, 
Warne & Co. Each volume contains a brief sketch 
of the artist by some critic of authority, a list of his 
principal works, and some sixty reproductions in 
half-tone of representative pictures, besides a fron- 
tispiece in photogravure. 

Owing to the lack of suitable editions, many 
French plays of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries are seldom read in American schools and 
colleges. With the purpose of widening the range 
of study in this field, Messrs. Ginn & Company are 
planning to issue scholarly editions of a number of 
the best plays of this period. The first of these pub- 
lications will include Rotrou's 'Saint Genest' and 
' Venceslas. ' edited by Professor T. F. Crane of Cor- 
nell Universitv,

SECOND EDITION 

MORAL EDUCATION 

By EDWARD HOWARD QRIQQS 

A discussion of the whole problem of moral education ; its aim in i-elation to our society and all the means through which 

that aim can be attained. 
"Every one who owns and reads Stanley Hall's monumental work on 'Adolescence,' will want to own and read Griggs's ' Moral Education.' 
And the wise parent who cannot have both books will choose the latter because of its more immediate availability in child training and its sane- 
ness and informed conservatism." — The Church Standard (Philadelphia).

THE CUMULATIVE BOOK REVIEW DIGEST 

THE NEED 

■' The appraisal of literature seems to me to be die most impoi-taait subject and the niost difficult 

problem now before the library world-'" — Henky L. ELEMDdKF. 
"The appraisal which is mostly wanted aims to be niaihly descriptive." — ^W. I. Fletcher. 
" What I want is the collated residts of the opinions of several men.'" — Ebnest C. Richardsok. 

To meet this need we have established a monthly magazine to be known as THE CUMULATIVE BOOK REVIEW 
DIGEST, which will furnish month by month, in one alphabet, an appreciative, accurate, and condensed description of the 
scope and character of the leading books, together with an epitome of tlie opinions of the leading- critics of the English- 
speaking world concerning the same. This avoids the limitations and fallibility of systems which depend upon one man's 
opinion, and furnishes, in convenient form, an up-to-date means of securing an evaluation of current books.

The Progress of Hellenism in Alexander's Empire 

By John P. Mahaffy, Sometime Professor of Ancient History in the University of Dublin. 
Professor Mahaffy has in this book epitomized the results of his studies, extending- over more than twenty yeai-s and 
covering all the known records of Greek influence in Alexander's empire. The book is thus a compendium of rare 
value : to the student it presents an accurate summary of a most brilliant culture epoch ; to the casual reader it offers 
an outline for more extended reading. $1.00 net; prepaid, $1.10. 



The Messianic Hope in 
the New Testament 

By Shailek Mathews, 
Professor of New Testament History in 

the University of Chicago. 
New Testament study along histor- 
ical lines and embodying the latest 
results of critical work in popular 
form is extremely rare in America. 
This book is an example of such 
study. It subjects the narrative to 
a searching criticism and seeks to 
determine which of the concepts 
common to the writers are of local 
application and contemporary, and 
wiuch are applicable vmder all 
circumstances of time and place. 
The messianic hope forms the main 
theme of the discussion.

Studies in 
General Physiology 

(In two volumes) 

By Jacques Loeb, 
Head of the Department of Physiology in 

the University of California. 
Professor Loeb has long been endeav- 
oring to ascertain the laws controlling 
physical life-phenomena, and espe- 
cially those involved in reproduction. 
He has finally succeeded in artificially 
fertilizing ova, and has been able to 
develop the ova thus treated. The 
experiments have not been elsewhere 
recorded, so that these volumes possess 
a special value to physicians and other 
students of biology. For many years 
Prof. Loeb's results will form the point 
of departure in similar investigations. 

$7.50 net; prepaid, $7.90. 



Lectures on Commerce 

Edited by Henry R. Hatfield, 
Formerly Dean of the College of Com- 
merce and Administration in the 
University of Chicago. 

These lectures — sixteen in number 
— were delivered before the College 
of Conmierce and Administration in 
the University of Chicago. They 
treat of railways, banking, trade, 
industry ; and inasmuch as the lec- 
turers include such men as Secretary 
Morton, Ex-Comptroller Eckels, 
Vice-President Forgan, Professor 
Laughlin, they are extremely inter- 
esting to all who wish a first-hand 
account of modern and successful 
business methods. The book Ls of 
excejitional value to young men. 

$1.50 net; prepaid, $1.63. 



The Place of Industries in Elementary 
Education 

By Katharine E. Dopp, 
Instructor in the University of Chicago. 
This book recognizes the relation between the periods of 
growth in the child and the stages or ages of mdustrial 
development in the race. It is pointed out that better 
Insults in primary education can be attauied only by 
assigning to the industries a much larger place in the 
curriculum than heretofore. A recent revision has 
enlarged the volume by some 70 pages of text and 16 full- 
page illustrations. $1.00 net; prepaid, $1.11. 



The Psychology of Child Development 

By Irving King, 
Professor of Psychology :n Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. 
This book is the first attempt to apply the functional 
point of view to child psychology, and it promises to 
transform the study from a dreary catalogue of " facts " 
for which none but a few enthusiasts care, to a really 
illuminating and scientific account of child-life. To 
those teachers who have felt the stimulus of Dr. 
Dewey's educational thought, this application of his 
method will be welcome and inspiring. 

$1.00 net; prepaid, $1.10. 



A History of Matrimonial Institutions (vSium") 

By George E. Howard, Professor of Institutional History in the University of Nebraska. 
Professor Howard has given in these volumes the most complete study yet published on the history of marriage and 
divorce. The work is in three parts. In the first the author fixes the sociological basis for the discussion ; the 
second treats of the development of marriage in England ; the third is devoted to marriage and divorce in the United 
States. Everyone following the widespread discussion of the marriage and divorce problem should have access to 

this work. $10.00 net; prepaid, $10.72. 



The Trend in Higher Education 

By William Rainey Harper, 
President of the University of Chicago. 
Here, within the limits of a single book, President 
Harper gives the gist of his addresses and papers upon 
the general subject of higher education. It goes without 
saying that the volume is meeting a hearty welcome 
from that large class of readers who are interested in 
the development of our educational system; especially 
those actively engaged in perfecting the organization of 
the high schools, the colleges, and the universities. 

$1.50 net; prepaid, $1.66. 



Religion and the Higher Life 

By William Rainey Harper, 
President of the University of Chicago. 
In this book, President Harper attempts to suggest a 
solution for the religious problems which confront men 
and women during the periods of late youth and early 
manhood or womanhood. The book has its message for 
all who are honestly and earnestly striving to answer 
the questions which inevitably arise in connection with 
the religious life ; it is also a faithful index of religious 
conditions in our colleges and universities.

Charles D. Walcoll, Director of V. S. Geological Survey : — "I am impressed with the admirable plan of the work and with the thorough 

manner in which geological principles and processes and their results have been presented. The text is written in an entertaining style and is

"The author calls up the very sights and sounds of conflict, the crash of the shells, the 
hoarse cheers of the forlorn hope, the great ships as they crash their way through the Yel- 
low Sea, the visions of the searchlight stabbing the darkness around the doomed fortress."

A SALUTARY MEASUBE. 

The recent action of the New York City 
board of education, cutting from the elemen- 
tary school work a considerable portion of the 
extraneous matter which has fastened itself 
upon the system during recent years, may 
seem somewhat drastic, and possibly may have 
gone too far, but it embodies a legitimate 
reaction from the excesses of the sentimental- 
ists, who, in their zeal for what they are 
pleased to call ' the enrichment of the curri- 
culum,' and * the education of the whole child,* 
have quite lost their sense of educational 
perspective. The trouble with all these ad- 



vocates of manual training, and domestic arts, 
and the various devices for combining a vast 
deal of entertainment with a modicum of 
discipline in the teaching of children, is that 
their enthusiasm gets the better of their judg- 
ment, and that they make the most unwar- 
ranted demands upon the limited store of 
time and money available for public school 
support Each of these fancies or * fads ' — to 
use just for once that objectionable word — 
has its proper claims and its proper sphere in 
the educational plan, but its sponsors are 
never willing to accept what is fairly admissi- 
ble in its behalf; their zeal carries them be- 
yond all bounds, and their misguided champ- 
ionship impels them to efforts which tend to 
impair the fundamental integrity of essential 
education. 

We have no quarrel whatever with any of 
these matters on its own account. All are 
good and helpful in their respective ways; all 
are capable of contributing some useful ele- 
ment to the unfolding mind. But the moment 
they begin to be treated as other than adjuncts, 
the moment they attempt to encroach upon 
the area that belongs to the essentials, 
then the time comes when even,- sound edu- 
cational instinct must discredit them, when 
every rational educational activity must be 
exerted to keep them in their own place. If 
we can have all these pleasant things, or some 
of them, without giving one whit less atten- 
tion than before to the matters that are really 
necessar}-, well and good; but if they are to 
be had only at the expense of the vital ele- 
ments of instruction, then the face of the 
educator cannot be set too sternly against 
them. It is very pretty to talk about the 
development of the social consciousness, and 
about reproducing in the individual the exper- 
ience of the race, but if the child who has 
been made the victim of these experiments 
comes out of school unable to write a credita- 
bly spelled and composed letter, unable to per- 
form an arithmetical operation with certainty, 
unable to exhibit an accurate knowledge of 
elementary history and geography, the educa- 
tion of that child has been a failure, no mat- 
ter how many games he has played in school, 
or how much skill he has acquired in clay- 
modelling and basket-weaving, or how well he 
can sew on a button. 

How well we know the particular quality 
of scorn with which this old-fashioned doc- 
trine is greeted by the pedagogical senti- 
mentalist, and with what superiorly he recites 



256 



THE DIAL,

for its demolition the parrot-formulae of 
his pet species of psychology. Enveloping the 
subject in a mist of words, he so befogs 
the question at issue that Ms antagonist re- 
tires from the conflict baffled by the very 
intangibility of the weapons with which he is 
assailed, but assuredly none the less certain 
of the solid ground upon which his feet are 
planted. For all these vaporings of the 
theorist cannot shake the conviction of plain 
sensible persons that the business of the school 
is teaching and not amusement, that the 
child who has the rough ways smoothed for 
him at every step is not the child who will 
acquire the power to overcome difficulties by 
his own efforts, that hard work is the only 
work worth doing, and that the development 
of concentrated thought and strengthened will 
is the final end toward which the educational 
process should be directed. 

How well also we know the more definite 
arguments adduced in behalf of that dilution 
of education which has been going on during 
the past generation, and how meaningless these 
arguments become when closely examined. 
With all the changes rung upon them by 
pedagogical rhetoricians, these pleas for ' the 
new education' are reducible to the fol- 
lowing three : that the hand should be trained 
to act no less than the head, that things 
should be studied as well as words, and that 
the cultivation of thought is as important as 
the cultivation of memory. Admirable pre- 
cepts all three, but perverted to most unworthy 
uses. For these maxims, used as weapons in 
the arsenal of the half-educated propagandist, 
are only too apt to become the agencies of a 
reactionary process, speciously labeled reform, 
which is hostile to the inmost spirit of educa- 
tion. The 'hand and head' argument sub- 
stitutes training in the practical arts for the 
intellectual discipline of the school; the 
'things and words' argument subtly discour- 
ages the pursuit of all the nobler subjects of 
study; while the * thought and memory' ar- 
gument offers a veiled apology for the deplora- 
ble laxity of the present generation of young 
people, whose most conspicuous defect, when 
the school turns them loose upon society, is 
that they know few things or none with either 
exactness or certainty. 

If it is becoming all the time more apparent 
that these are the actual results of our over- 
weighted and over-ornamented school courses, 
it is surely time to call a halt, and endeavor 
to get back to something like first principles. 
A popular political maxim assures us that the 
cure for the evils of democracy is more 
democracy, and we shall doubtless be assured 
by the upholders of the present educational 



anarchy that what we need by way of a rem- 
edy for its unfortunate results is still more 
anarchy — a still greater confusion of acci- 
dent with essence, a still further abandonment 
of discipline, a still closer levelling of educa- 
tional values, and a still wider scope for the 
pedagogical vagaries that are invading our 
schools from every quarter. This is a view 
which we cannot share, and therefore, with- 
out knowing at all closely the nature of the 
situation in the New York schools, we 
are inclined to welcome as a salutary measure 
the reported recent action of the authorities. 
It may not have been a very intelligent action, 
and its motives may not have been of the 
highest, but it seems to have been taken in the 
right direction, and its instinctive basis seems 
to have been soimd. In many important mat- 
ters New York, so long in the rear, has 
recently been taking the lead in educational 
affairs. It has set the other large cities of the 
country a notable example in the matters of 
school architecture, of salary and pension 
measures for the security of the teaching 
profession, of the extension of educational 
activities beyond the range of what is usually 
attempted by public school systems. Its course 
in the matter now under consideration is 
likely to raise a storm of dissent, but we are 
constrained to believe that the outcome will be 
for good. 

In closing this discussion, we wish to say 
once more that we have no objection to the 
new school subjects on their own account. "We 
are opposed to them only to the extent to 
which they encroach upon the time and re- 
sources available for the fundamentals, only 
to the extent to which they serve to dilute the 
strength of the old-time educational brew. 
Kindergartens and schools for manual training 
and courses in the domestic arts are nice 
things to have, but they must not be permit- 
ted to abridge the attention given to the more 
serious work of education, or to impair the 
energies devoted to its service. As long as 
their secondary importance is freely admitted, 
as long as they are treated as adjuncts to the 
system, to be employed when the means are 
available, and to be dropped when they are 
not, we give them cordial approval. But 
when they become parasitic upon the system, 
when instead of drawing from their own 
sources of energy, they tend to absorb the 
energies that should be apolied to more vital 
needs, then they become a danger of the most 
insidious sort. 

That this danger is a real one must be 
apparent to every close observer of our public 
schools. In most communities, the problem of 
ways and means, even for essential matters, is

a difficult one at best, and most of our systems 
are subject to periodical shrinkages. When 
such a shrinkage occurs, the obviously rational 
policy is to provide for it at the expense of the 
subjects and activities of secondary import- 
ance, leaving the essentials untouched; but it 
is only too often the case in such an emer- 
gency that the pruning-knife is applied to all 
parts of the system alike, vital as well as' 
accessory. The question is made one of ' jobs ' 
instead of being kept one of educational inter- 
ests. All the subjects once intrenched within 
a school system claim equal consideration with 
all the others, and so great is the present con- 
fusion of the public mind concerning the 
whole question of relative educational values 
that the impudent claim of cooking to be as 
important as arithmetic, of the kindergarten 
to be as important as the high school, is as 
likely as not to be allowed by those in author- 
ity. This is the danger which should enjoin 
a cautious conservatism upon all school boards 
and superintendents when the question arises 
of some new extension of their activity; this 
it is which should make for them the motto 
festina lente the capstone of the arch of 
educational wisdom. 



SOMi: ASPERITIES AND AMENITIES 
OF C RITIC ISM. 

A hypercritical censor of art, so the story 
goes, one day approached a certain picture, de- 
termined to find no good thing in it, and at 
once exclaimed against the coloring, the draw- 
ing, the light and shade, the perspective, the 
grouping, in fact against every detail both of 
conception and of execution. 'And that fly, 
too ! ' was the final querulous criticism ; * no 
more like a real fly than I am ! ' whereupon the 
preposterous insect, in superb disregard of all 
the canons of art, took wing and flew away. 

The fable illustrates the futility of much 
that passes under the name of criticism. But 
the critic's (the literary critic's) failing is now 
alleged to be not undue severity, but too facile 
praise. Complaisance, however, is no new dis- 
ease of criticism. It is curious to note that 
seventy-five years ago, in the palmy days of 
Jeffrey, Brougham, Lockhart, and Macaulay, 
in the vigorous early prime of the * Edinburgh,' 
the ' Quarterly,' and ' Blackwood's,' the same 
complaint of indiscriminate eulogy was made 
against critics of English literature. 'At pres- 
ent,' writes Macaulay in 1830, 'however con- 
temptible a poem or a novel may be, there is 
not the least difficulty in procuring favorable 
notices of it from all sorts of publications, 
daily, weekly, and monthly. In the meantime. 



little or nothing is said on the other side. The 
author and the publisher are interested in cry- 
ing up the book. Nobody has any strong inter- 
est in crying it down. Those who are best 
fitted to guide the public opinion, think it be- 
neath them to expose mere nonsense, and com- 
fort themselves by reflecting that such popu- 
larity cannot last. This contemptuous lenity 
has been carried too far.' Nevertheless, it i» 
not ' contemptuous lenity ' but contemptuous^ 
severity that most impresses the student ot 
early nineteenth-century literary criticism in. 
England. Eeviewers of the laxly lenient type 
there doubtless were, but their works have 
either perished with them or are at present not- 
readily accessible. A full century having now. 
passed since the rise of English literary criti- 
cism (in periodical form) of a serious andr 
worthy sort, it may not be uninteresting to- 
glance back and scan some of its more signifi- 
cant or more amusing features. Possibly, too^ 
a moral or a lesson may deduce itself from 
such incidents and anecdotes as can find place 
in so brief a retrospect. 

All criticism must necessarily lag behind 
creation, and the closer it presses on the lat- 
ter's heels, the more liable it is to ill-considered 
judgment and glaring error. Hence when & 
century ago, with the opening of a new era id 
English poetry, the critics attempted to pass 
judgment on tiie new school of poets as fast a& 
their works issued from the press — works so 
startlingly revolutionary as judged by previous 
canons of poetic criticism — there could not' 
but be, as viewed by a later age, many wild 
utterances, many absurdly unjust apportion- 
ments of praise and blame, many amazingly 
false predictions as to the young singers' final 
fate, whether of oblivion or of immortalityi. 
' This will never do ! ' cries the bewildered and 
dismayed Jeffrey in reviewing ' The Excur- 
sion ' ; and the flayers of Keats and Shelley and 
Coleridge and Byron take up the refrain, with- 
only here and there a discerning and courage-^ 
ous critic to put in a word of commendation^ 
The sentence from Publius Syrus, Judex dam-- 
natur cum nocens absolvitur, which the ' Edin- 
burgh Eeview' adopted as its motto, received- 
an altogether new and unwarranted interpreta- 
tion; for now not the innocence but the guilt 
of the hapless wight at the bar was assumed in. 
advance of proof. Not to point out excellences^ 
but to detect and ridicule faults was the critic's 
proper function. Truly it was no primrose- 
path of pleasantness that the poet sauntared 
down, no balmy atmosphere of unmixed adula- 
tion that he breathed, in those days of slashing 
reviews and cut-throat criticisms. The Quar- 
terly and Blackwood reviews of Keats's 'En— 
dymion ' are perhaps too well known to call for^

any extracts from their scurrilities. But not so 
well known is Gifford's cynical retort upon being 
■expostulated with for his severity, a severity 
that had moved some nameless sympathizer 
with its victim to send him a handsome testi- 
monial in the form of a banknote. ' How can 
you, Gifford,' pleaded the remonstrant, 'dish 
up in this dreadful manner a youth who has 
never offended you ? ' * It has. done him good,' 
replied the editor of the ' Quarterly,' continu- 
ing his writing, with his green shade before his 
■eyes, totally insensible to all reproach or 
•entreaty ; ' he has had twenty-five pounds from 
Devonshire.' Still more relentlessly cruel was 
•the treatment Keats received from the Black- 
wood reviewer, the abominable ' Z ' ; for, not 
content with flaying him alive and spraying 
him with vitriol, the heartless wretch, three 
years after the poet's death, executed a war- 
dance of triumph on his grave, exemplifying 
anew a too common propensity to add insult to 
injury. Here is a sample of the writer's pleas- 
antry : 

^Mr. Shelley, it seems, died with a volume of Mr. 
Keats 's poetry "grasped with one hand in his 
bosom" — rather an awkward posture, as you will 
be convinced if you try it. But what a rash man 
Shelley was, to put to sea in a frail boat with Jack 's 
poetry on board! Why, man, it would sink a trireme. 
In the preface to Mr. Shelley's poems, we are told 
that "his vessel bore out of sight with a favorable 
wind"; but what is that to the purpose? It 
had "Endymion" on board, and there was an end. 
Seventeen ton of pig-iron would not be more fatal 
ballast. Down went the boat with a "swirl"! I 
lay a wager that it righted soon after ejecting Jack. ' 

Not satisfied with this, the editors of the maga- 
zine preface their volume for 1826 with still 
further abuse. 'Keats was a Cockney,' they 
declare, 'and Cockneys claimed him for their 
own. Never was there a young man so encrusted 
with conceit.' And more of like sort. Even 
twenty years after Keats's death we find his 
-calumniators vainly striving to lay his ghost. 
•'A good deal of Waddle,' they write, 'was 
levelled against the conductors of this review 
when they had the misfortune to criticize a 
«ickly poet, who died soon afterwards, appar- 
■ently for the express purpose of dishonouring 
. . The article was not written with 



us 



«,ny intention of damaging Mr. John Keats's 
lungs or stomach. . . . But how are we to 
anticipate such contingencies? Must we, then, 
adopt the wise precautions of our ancestors in 
•cases of physical torture, and send the proofs 
to be read over in the presence of a physician 
who, thumb on pulse, might indicate the pas- 
sages which are too much for human nature to 
endure ?' 

The slashing style of criticism will enjoy a 
•certain popularity as long as hiunan nature is 
not angelic nature. The primitive instinct that 



takes delight in bull-baiting and cock-fighting, 
finds pleasure of the same sort, but more 
refined, more intellectual, in a skilfully waged 
war of words, if only the battle be fought with- 
out too repellent barbarity, too manifest disre- 
gard of accepted rules, on either side. And 
even where the contest is wholly one-sided and 
the defendant has no chance to be heard, the 
disinterested onlooker is none the less enter- 
tained if only the blows appear to be aimed 
all above the belt. But occasionally the victim 
of these assaults refuses to take his castigation 
in silence. An historic instance is Tennyson's 
neat retort upon Christopher North, who had 
reviewed in ' Blackwood's Magazine,' in a 
fashion not to the poet's liking, his first volume 
of verse. Familiar though the lines must be 
to many, they will bear repetition here. 

' You did late review my lays. 

Crusty Christopher; 
You did mingle blame and praise, 

Rusty Christopher. 
When I learnt from whom It came, 

I forgave you all the blame, 

Musty Christopher ; 
I could not forgive the praise, 

Fusty Christopher.' 

This must have been dictated by somewhat the 
same feeling that led the Greek orator, on hear- 
ing himself applauded by the rabble, to turn to 
a candid friend and ask whether he had said 
anything foolish. Thackeray, too, in one mem- 
orable instance, made a very fitting and amus- 
ing retort upon his critic. The ' Times ' had 
reviewed in highly offensive language his 
Christmas story, ' The Kickleburys on the 
Rhine,' stigmatizing it as a pot-boiler of the 
meanest order; and the critic had thus charac- 
terized the class of work to which it was 
assigned, — ' For the most part bearing the 
stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the 
writer's exchequer rather than in the fulness 
of his genius, they suggest by their feeble 
flavour the rinsings of a void brain after the 
more important concoctions of the expired 
year.' In reply to this ' hurticle,' as Thackeray 
might well have called it, he prefixed to the 
second edition of his tale ' An Essay on Thun- 
der and Small Beer,' in which he bantered 
' Jupiter Jeames ' on his style, his ' hoighth of 
foine language entoirely,' his pompous Latin- 
ity, and so on, until poor ' Jupiter Jeames ' 
must have felt like hiding his diminished head 
— except that it was already snugly hidden 
under the safe cloak of anonymity. 

But the aggrieved author is not always so 
happy in his method of rejoinder. Less in con- 
sonance with the original offense is the resort 
to fire-arms, rather than to ink, as a mode of 
retaliation. Jeffrey's scathing and, in truth, 
offensively personal review of Moore's 'Epis- 
tles, Odes, and other Poems ' elicited a chal-

lenge from the irascible little Irishman. Jeff- 
rey, who chanced then to be in London, 
accepted it, and the combatants met at Chalk 
Farm in the early morning of August 12, 1806. 
The issue of the affair furnished the town with 
food for merriment for weeks to come. ' What 
a beautiful morning it is ! 'remarked the Scotch- 
man to the Irishman. ' Yes,* was the reply, ' a 
morning made for better purposes'; to which 
the other breathed a sigh of assent. After fur- 
ther pleasant chat during the loading of the 
pistols, the duellists took their places and were 
about to fire, when the watchful providence 
that has been known to intervene on other sim- 
ilar occasions stayed the hands uplifted for 
mutual bloodshed. Policemen from Bow Street 
burst through the hedge and took the com- 
batants into custody. This well-timed inter- 
ruption, together with the finding of Jeffrey's 
pistol to be bulletless — an item that soon trans- 
formed and amplified itself into the report 
that neither pistol was loaded — afterward 
prompted Byron's sarcastic allusion, in his 
* English Bards and Scotch Eeviewers,' to ' Lit- 
tle's leadless pistol.' This in turn nearly caused 
a duel between Moore and Byron, but led in the 
end to their acquaintance and friendship. 
Meanwhile Jeffrey and Moore had met at a 
friend's house, the Scotchman had pacified the 
Irishman by graciously admitting the excep- 
tionable nature of parts of the offending review, 
and the upshot of it all was a firm and fast 
friendship between the two from that day for- 
ward. All's well that ends well. Similarly, 
the merciless judgment passed by Jeffrey on 
Byron's ' Juvenile Poems ' opened the way ulti- 
mately to a noble friendship between poet and 
critic. It is conjectured, and not without 
plausibility, that had it not been for the dis- 
sipated young lord's early flagellation at Jeff- 
rey's hands he might never have aroused him- 
self to such worthy exertion as gave to the world 
his subsequent better poems. We certainly 
should never have seen the ' English Bards ' 
had it not been for the Scotch reviewer. Pleas- 
ing to note is the latter's handsome tribute to 
the merits of Byron's greater works — so strik- 
ingly in contrast with the persistent persecution 
of Keats by the Blackwood critic. ' None but a 
great soul dared hazard it,' declared Byron in 
generous admiration; 'a little scribbler would 
have gone on cavilling to the end of the chap- 
ter.' 

These 'and similar instances of retort, espe- 
cially where the disputants remember that they 
are gentlemen before they are writers, diversify 
and enliven the pages of literary history. But 
most often the critic has the first, last, and only 
word in the matter, however much one might 
like to hear the other side. Macaulay, for 



example, cuts to pieces poor Robert Montgom- 
ery until the reader of his critique is fairly 
driven to side with the luckless poet. ' We have 
no enmity to Mr. Robert Montgomery,' declares 
the critic, and the reader at once knows this to- 
be the prelude to a merciless onslaught on Mr. 
Robert. Finding here and there in his poems 
reminders of earlier poets, Macaulay accuses 
him unsparingly of plagiarism. The whole 
arraignment serves, and was perhaps (though 
half-unconsciously) meant to serve, as an 
opportunity to display the critic's remarkable 
powers of memory and his breadth, of reading. 
The accusation of plagiarism, of *very coolly 
appropriating' this and that and the other, is 
hardly made good. The reviewer's parting stab 
is intended to give Mr. Montgomery his quietus. 
After noticing in no admiring terms the poem 
entitled ' Satan,' Macaulay offers this bit of 
counsel, — ' We would seriously advise Mr. 
Montgomery to omit, or alter, about a hundred 
lines in different parts of this large volume, 
and to republish it under the name of 
" Gabriel." ' And at the very end he says, ' If 
our remarks give pain to Mr. Robert Mont- 
gomery, we are sorry for it,' with a few more 
equally comforting words. Montgomery's poem* 
cannot now be said to be in everybody's mouthy 
but it would be rash to attribute their obscurity 
to Macaulay's wild and wanton rhetoric in the 
* Edinburgh Review.' 

After a dose of early nineteenth-century 
book-reviews, one may well feel inclined to say 
with the elder Disraeli, ' That undue severity 
of criticism which diminishes the number of 
good authors is a greater calamity than even 
that mawkish panegyric which may invite indif- 
ferent ones.' A worthless book soon dies, but 
any unjust censure that checks the production 
of good ones is regrettable. Jeffrey himself in 
later life admitted that he had erred on the side 
of severity. 'A certain tone of exaggeration,*^ 
he says in retracting some of his strictures on 
Burns, * is incident, we fear, to the sort of writ- 
ing in which we are engaged. Reckoning a lit- 
tle too much on the dulness of our readers, we 
are often unconsciously led to overstate our sen- 
timents in order to make them understood ; and; 
when a little controversial warmth is added to 
a little love of effect, an excess of colouring is 
apt to steal over the canvas, which ultimately 
offends no eye so much as our own.' In the pre- 
face to his collected essays Jeffrey further 
acknowledges that he has said * petulant and' 
provoking things ' of Southey, and that he has- 
of ten spoken * rather too bitterly and confi- 
dently of the faults' of Wordsworth. StiU he 
adheres substantially to his early opinions, and 
claims credit for making prominent in all his 
discussions the moral worth or worthlessness of

the book reviewed. Good morals and good 
literature, he holds, go together. 

Turning from these now half-forgotten crit- 
ical writings of a century ago, the curious 
reader of them cannot but retain a sense of the 
earnestness and zeal animating their better 
pages, and of the more than respectable learn- 
ing and ability they often display. Something 
of this seriousness of purpose might profitably 
be cultivated by present-day critics. A review 
that rivals or perhaps eclipses in interest and 
learning the work reviewed, or at least that sup- 
plements it with matter of real worth, is always 
a pleasant thing to read, but how rarely met 
with in the hasty book-notices of today! One 
fault of the early reviewers will of course be 
committed by their successors as long as these 
successors are fallible, — the fault of uninten- 
tionally slighting genius and exalting its oppo- 
site. But that these past appraisers of litera-

lences, some measure of instruction for present 
guidance, and for present caution, is not to be 

disputed. pj,goY F. BiCKNELL.

A POINT IN PUBLISHING ETHICS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The great magazines of the country appeal to 
a wide circle of readers, many of them being reg- 
ular subscribers and many being regular buyers 
from the news-stands. These make up the clien- 
tele of the magazines and determine their suc- 
cess. Is it just, then, to this large body of regular 
readers for the publishers to issue in bookform an 
important serial before the last two or three in- 
stalments appear in the magazine? The reason 
for the early publication is obvious: it means 
money in the pocket of the publishing company, 
and that is perhaps the main object the company 
has in view. But, again, is it just to the maga- 
zine's regular supporters? Doubtless there are 
those who become so absorbed in a story that 
they are willing to purchase it in bookform to 
get the final chapters a little earlier, yet they are 
probably only a small proportion of the whole 
number of readers. Most of those who buy the 
book, it is safe to say, have not read the monthly 
instalments. Is it just to cater in so marked a 
degree to this class while the regular subscribers 
are asked to wait? Would there not be quite as 
many buyers of the book, if it were published 
after its completion in the magazine ? In this age 
of commercialism, it is perhaps too much to ex- 
pect that the publishing companies will worry 
thenaselves over such questions of ethics. And 
yet it is an injustice to their great body of sup- 
porters that they could and should avoid.

The Reminiscences of a Dipl-omatist.* 



The life of Mr. Andrew D. White has been 
remarkably full of incident and rich in oppor- 
tunity. As professor in the University of 
Michigan, president of Cornell University, min- 
ister plenipotentiary to Russia, minister and 
ambassador to Germany, and president of the 
American delegation at the Peace Conference 
of The Hague, he has rendered distinguished 
services to his country for which he will be held 
in grateful remembrance. For more than fifty 
years he has enjoyed the acquaintance and the 
friendship of many of the most prominent 
scholars and statesmen of the time. Not the 
least, therefore, of the services for which we are 
indebted to him is the record that he has now 
given us of the observations and experiences of 
half a century. Much of this matter has 
appeared, in an abridged form, in ' The Century 
Magazine' in the last two years; but a great 
deal has never before seen the light. 

Mr. White divides his work under the follow- 
ing convenient heads : Environment and Edu- 
cation; Political life; As University Pro- 
fessor; As University President; In the Diplo- 
matic Service; Sundry Journeys and Expe- 
riences; Miscellaneous Recollections; Religious 
Development. Some slight overlapping was of 
course inevitable ; yet it is far better so, for each 
group of experiences and reflections thus stands 
out by itself, a distinct unit, yet linked by means 
of imobtrusive cross-references to other related 
groups. In arrangement the work is a model. 
By his skill in the selection of material, and 
by his admirably lucid and even style, the author 
has made every page intensely interesting. 

Bom in a prosperous little village of Central 
New York in 1832, Mr. White enjoyed the ad- 
vantages of a happy, wholesome life to which 
both poverty and riches were alike strangers. 
The glimpses he gives us of the futile educa- 
tional methods of those days remind us of the 
vast changes that have taken place in half a 
century. ' Gerund-grinding ' — against which 
he is very bitter — has not, it is too true, 
entirely disappeared; but the lecture system 
has been introduced (largely through Mr. 
White's example), and the study of the modem 
languages and literatures and of pure science 
is now generally on an equal footing with that 
of the Greek and Roman classics. Going abroad 
in the summer of 1853, Mr. White lived first in 
Paris, hearing lectures at the Sorbonne and the 
College de France; later, as attache of the 
American legation, in St. Petersburg ; and lastly

in Berlin, where he heard Lepsius, the S^yptol- 
ogist, Boeckh on Grecian history, Karl Eitter 
on physical geography, von Eaumer on Italian 
history, and Hirsch on modem history. Ranke 
he pictures as having 

*A habit of becoming so absorbed in his subject, 
aa to slide down in his chair, hold his finger up 
toward the ceiling, and then, with his eye fastened 
on the tip of it, to go mumbling through a kind of 
rhapsody, which most of my German fellow-students 
confessed they could not understand. It was a 
comical sight: half a dozen students crowding 
around his desk, listening as priests might listen 
to the sibyl on her tripod, the other students being 
scattered through the room in various stages of 
discouragement. ' 

Similar forgetfulness of the needs of one's 
auditors, though perhaps not in so extreme a 
form, is not unknown in some of our universi- 
ties even to-day. 

In politics Mr. White began life — in 1840, 
of course — as a Whig. Most entertaining are 
his recollections of the building of log cabins 
with the latch-string hanging out, the barrels 
of hard cider, the raccoon skins, the balls kept 
' a-rolling on,' the screaming eagles and crowing 
cocks of a campaign fitly characterized as *an 
apotheosis of tom-foolery.' With the campaign 
of 1844 the slavery question loomed up in poli- 
tics. Concerning Henry Clay and the slave 
problem, Mr. White says: 

'How blind we all were! Henry Clay, a Ken- 
tucky slave-holder, would have saved us. Infinitely 
better than the violent solutions proposed to us was 
his large statesmanlike plan of purchasing the slave 
children as they were born and setting them free. 
Without bloodshed, and at cost of the merest 
nothing as compared to the cost of the Civil War, 
he would thus have solved the problem; but it was 
not so to be. The guilt of the nation was not to 
be so cheaply atoned for.' 

The defeat of Fremont in 1856, Mr. White 
thinks, was providential. Had the great strug- 
gle been precipitated then, the outcome might 
have been far different. Moreover, Mr. White 
fully believes in the sincerity of President Bu- 
chanan and his associates, who 'honestly and 
patriotically shrank ' from the horrible prospect 
of civil war and disunion. 

The importance of the work done before and 
during the Civil War by Mr. White and other 
teachers and public speakers is too often over- 
looked and too easily underestimated. He 
sought ever to spread intelligence of the 
demoralizing effects of slavery; to aid in train- 
ing up 'a new race of young men who should 
understand our own time and its problems in 
the light of history.' His main work was done 
in his well-filled lecture room at Ann Arbor, 
where his discussions of the growth and decay 
of feudalism and of the serf system could not 
fail to throw much light on the tendencies of 
slavery. In a visit to Europe in the fall of 1863, 



he helped in the work, which had then become 
extremely important, of increasing the numbers 
of those friendly to the Union cause and opposed 
to European intervention, and of procuring 
takers for the new national bonds. 

In commenting upon the more recent events 
of our political life, Mr. White more than once 
speaks of what is, in his opinion, * the worst evil 
in American public life, — that facility for un- 
limited slander, of which the first result is to 
degrade our public men, and the second result 
is to rob the press of that confidence among 
thinking people, and that power for good and 
against evil which it really ought to exercise.* 
An interesting illustration of this is the popular 
fiction, long held, that the first battle of Bull 
Eun was lost because General McDowell was 
drunk. At a banquet in 1883, Mr. White 
learned from General McDowell himself that he 
had been, throughout his military career, a total 
abstainer ! 

Another valuable criticism concerns our polit- 
ical conventions, in which the principal part 
is now at times played by spectators, and which 
in consequence is subject, at such times, to mob 
rule. It is indeed 'a monstrous abuse.' 

Twenty years of Mr. White's life, from 1865 
to 1885, were given to the work of helping to 
found, and of administering, Cornell University. 
No chapter in the history of American educa- 
tion is more interesting, and perhaps none is 
more important, than this ; not so much because 
of the wonderful growth of Cornell as because 
of the instructive lessons to be learned by edu- 
cators and philanthropists from its early history. 
The difficulties with which Mr. Cornell and Mr. 
White had to contend were enormous: lack of 
available means, more students than could be 
handled, some of whom were grieved because 
they could not earn their own living in the uni- 
versity, above all, the most violent and persistent 
opposition from sectarian institutions and 
presses. So wisely, however, did they lay the 
foundations of the university, that no important 
deviation from their policy has ever been made. 
The career of usefulness that the university has 
already had is the best answer to the critics — 
and the slanderers — of its early days. 

About half of the book is devoted to the 
author's diplomatic experiences and to the 
observations and reflections incident to his diplo- 
matic life. The public has already been able 
to form some idea of the immense importance 
of these memoirs in the light they throw upon 
the actions and characters of the great protag- 
onists of recent European history — among 
them Lord John Russell, Lord Pauncefote, 
Thiers, De Lesseps, Cavour, Bismarck, Frede- 
rick III., William II., Miinster, Von Biilow, 
Nicholas II., Pobedonostzeff, De Witte, Von

Plehve, Makharoff, Franz Josef; and no less 
important in their way are the impressions he 
records of Tolstoi, Auerbach, Villari, Marco 
Minghetti, Freeman, Bishop Creighton, Sir 
Henry Maine, Lord Acton, Holman Hunt, and 
many others. 

Of the chapters that have to do with Euro- 
pean statesmen, the most important, probably, 
are those dealing with Bismarck and William 
II., which have already, in substance, appeared 
in ' The CentiTry.' Especially noteworthy is 
Mr. White's high opinion of the character and 
ability of the German Einperor, The effect of 
this contribution to our knowledge of William 
II., his environment, his aims, and his ambi- 
tions, must be to increase greatly that respect 
which most Americans already have for him, 
and to strengthen the tie that binds America, 
already so largely Teutonic in her citizenship, 
to the Continental mother-nation. 

The chapter on Tolstoi does not increase our 
admiration for the great Eussian, but probably 
voices the opinion that will ultimately be widely 
if not generally held. Mr. White's explanation 
of Tolstoi's narrowness of view is illuminating. 

'Of all distinguished men that I have ever met, 
Tolstoi seems to me most in need of that enlarge- 
ment of view and healthful modification of opinion 
which come from meeting men and comparing views 
with them in different lands and under different 
conditions. This need is all the greater because 
in Russia there is no opportunity to discuss really 
important questions. . . . The result is that his 
opinions have been developed without modification 
by any rational interchange of thought with other 
men. Under such circumstances any man, no mat- 
ter how noble or gifted, having given birth to 
striking ideas, coddles and pets them until they 
become the full-grown, spoiled children of his brain. 
He can at last see neither spot nor blemish in them, 
and comes virtually to believe himself infallible.' 

At the same time Mr. White believes Tolstoi 
to be 

'One of the most sincere and devoted men alive, 
a man of great genius and, at the same time, of 
very deep sympathy with his fellow-creatures. Out 
of this character of his come his theories of art 
and literature; and, despite their faults, they seem 
to me more profound and far-reaching than any 
put forth by any other man in our time. . . . 
His paradoxes will be forgotten; but his devoted 
life, his noble thoughts, and his lofty ideals will, 
as centuries roll on, more and more give life and 
light to the new Eussia.' 

These extracts are typical of the breadth of 
view, the sympathy, the candor, the tact that 
characterize Mr. White's utterances in this book 
as they have always done throughout his life. 
Fearless in his condemnation of stupidity, 
knavery, and quackery of every sort, he is care- 
ful, so far as possible, not to mention names 
where it would give pain to persons now living; 
as for example, in his references to the famous 
Fiske will case, the outcome of which shattered 



one of the dreams of his life, the establishment 
of a great library at Cornell. Accustomed to 
dealing with great questions and to taking large 
views of things, he naturally overlooks the 
petty, the mean, the narrow, when these are 
overbalanced by better things ; and his new ver- 
sion of the great Apostle's words is a creed of 
optimism most stimulating to the generation 
which is to carry on his work. 

'I have sought to fight the good fight; I have 
sought to keep the faith, — faith in a Power in 
the universe good enough to make truth-seeking 
wise, and strong enough to make truth-telling 
effective, — faith in the rise of man rather than 
in the fall of man, — faith in the gradual evolution 
and ultimate prevalence of right reason among 
men.'

The liATEST History op America.* 



For several months, historical students have 
awaited with no small degree of curiosity the 
appearance of the initial volume of Avery's 
' History of the United States,' to comprise in 
all twelve volumes, with colored illustrations 
and other novel features. The plan of the work 
is pretentious, the author's aim being to pre- 
sent in popular form an accurate and scholarly 
narrative of the whole course of American his- 
tory, — something that has never yet been suc- 
cessfully attempted. 

In the first volume, which deals mainly with 
the period of discovery and exploration, Dr. 
Avery pretends to no original investigation. 
His use of primary authorities seems to be 
restricted to those easily accessible in transla- 
tions. Internal evidence, indeed, points to the 
conclusion that he is not personally familiar 
with the Spanish language — the chief requisite 
for research work in this particular field. Even 
when the primary authorities are easily acces- 
sible, the author has not always used them, but 
has preferred to trust to secondary sources. A 
close comparison of his account of the third 
voyage of Columbus with that given by Wash- 
ington Irving shows how minutely he followed 
the earlier work. The two accounts are strictly 
parallel, the sequence of events and the way in 
which they are related being exactly the same. 
Variations occur in the expansion of words 
into phrases and phrases into clauses, with the 
occasional introduction of descriptive adjectives. 
For illustration, where Irving speaks simply of 
the ' Trinity,' Dr. Avery adds the word ' Holy,' 
following, in this respect, the example set by 

* A History of the United States and its Peoplr^ 
from the Earliest Records to the Present Time. By Elroy

Justin Winsor, who similarly depended far 
more upon secondary authorities than is usually 
supposed. 

Nevertheless, in a general way, as we con- 
clude from volume I., Dr. Avery is fully abreaiit 
of modem scholarship. By means of an 
exhaustive study of the best secondary authori- 
ties, he has made himself thoroughly conversant 
with the great problems in American history. 
On controverted points he has carefully weighed 
the evidence; and, in the majority of cases, 
has come to incline to the sounder opinion. This 
is notable in the matter of Amerigo Vespucius, 
where he has, most surprisingly, managed to 
steer clear of John Fiske's vagaries. Some- 
times, however, he hesitates, — as in his account 
of Sebastian Cabot, — scarcely knowing which 
side to take. To his notion, evidently, the con- 
flicting decisions seem pretty evenly balanced. 
As a result, the reader is left in doubt whether 
or not Sebastian Cabot was the leading spirit in 
the voyage of 1496-7. Dr. Aver}' seems to think 
he was; but the concensus of historical opinion 
points decidedly the other way. This wavering 
attitude, so vexatious to a critical reader, is 
another indication that the author has not him- 
self investigated the sources. 

Of really serious errors in the book, there are 
none. Minor discrepancies occur once in a 
while, as in the statement that Sir Francis 
Drake was the second European after Magellan 
to cross the Pacific Ocean. This is a repetition 
of Fiske. As a matter of fact, several Span- 
iards, in the interval between 1521 and 1578, 
had ventured there. Under certain circum- 
stances, omissions of important truths might 
well be counted as errors. Dr. Avery fails to 
remark that Sebastian Cabofs individual title 
to fame rests, not upon any share, self-attri- 
buted, in the voyages of his father, but upon 
his organization of the first English trading 
company, — a greater feat because of its far- 
reaching consequences. Furthermore, the 
attention of the reader has not been called to 
the rather unsatisfactory character of the only 
evidence we possess for the De Gourgues expe- 
dition. On these two occasions, Dr. Avery has 
not made the best possible use even of the 
secondary material ; for Professor F. H. Hodder 
pointed out Sebastian Cabofs real contribution 
to history several years ago, in an article in 
The Dial, and Mr. John G. Shea, to whom Dr. 
Avery is elsewhere much indebted, has, in his 
critical notes on Charlevoix, impeached the 
reliability of the purely French accounts of De 
Gourgues, — that is, he has, from the silence of 
Spanish annals, seriously questioned whether 
the Frenchmen, massacred by Menendez, were 
ever avenged in the manner cited by Parkman 
and acquiesced in by Dr. Avery. 



The first two chapters of the book, which 
are in their nature introductory, exhibit the 
same tantalizing dependence upon the opinions 
of particular individuals. Points in geology, 
not yet fully determined, are narrated with cer- 
tainty; while the theories urged respecting the 
age of man are peculiar to Professor G. F. 
Wright, who revised the second chapter. As 
the leading geologists and palaeontologists have 
persistently refused to accept them, it is unwise 
to embody them in a popular work. The 
twenty-second chapter is a first-rate general 
account of the Aborigines; and here Dr. Avery 
is very fortunate in having secured the co- 
operation of such an able Indian scholar as Mr. 
James Mooney. 

The great weakness of the book lies in the 
absence of page references ; and this criticism is 
made with all due regard to the avowed purpose 
of the author. It is true that lengthy notes 
often impede progress, and break, as it were, 
the continuity of the narrative. Nevertheless, 
some intimation of the sources of the book 
ought to be given. It is not enough to have at 
the end a fairly complete bibliography; the 
popular reader is not likely to make much use 
of it, and for the critical reader it is not suffi- 
cient. Exceptions might also be taken to the 
scanty use of quotation marks. The omission 
is intentional, yet hardly to be commended. 
Even to-day, the classical knowledge of the ordi- 
nary person is not of very wide range, espe- 
cially in the realm of poetry ; and, as Dr. Avery 
has a personal weakness for well-turned phrases, 
poetical catch-words, and flowery expressions, 
it is not presumed that the popular mind will 
alwaj's be able to make a distinction between 
quoted but uncredited poetry and original com- 
position. 

The illustrative material is a noticeable fea- 
ture of the entire book, and, with the possible 
exception of the imaginary cuts, which are 
likely to be misleading because they often rep- 
resent men of whom no portrait is known to 
exist, is worthy of unstinted praise. The pic- 
tures of objects, especially in the second chap- 
ter, are interesting and instructive. The maps 
throughout are well-selected and seem to us of 
unusual excellence, — clear, well-defined, and 
accurate. 

Dr. Avery's style of writing is smooth and 
flovdng; but it lacks the literary finish of 
Prescott, the elegant ease of Irving, and the 
wearing qualities of Fiske. It abounds in hack- 
neyed phrases, indirect statements, and meta- 
phors that are txyo often distracting. In short, 
it is altogether too flowery either for a perma- 
nent classic or for a serious piece of historical 
work. Such traits may, however, commend 
themselves to the general reader for whom tho

book was originally intended. Disregarding 
a faint touch of pedantry here and there, 
we may say in conclusion that the good points 
in the book far outnumber the bad, and augur 
well for the series. They show an extensive 
reading, and, withal, a most careful and judi- 
cious selection of secondary material. Admit- 
tedly, the book is a remarkable achievement for 
an untrained historian. It is something we 
have wanted for a long time; and, if the suc- 
ceeding volumes carry out the design of the

Some Recent Books in Economics.* 



Our steady and increasing interest in eco- 
nomic problems has lately produced^ several 
valuable results. There has been a growing dis- 
position on the part of our best writers to pro- 
duce clear and systematic monographs on spe- 
cial topics, designed not simply for the class- 
room but for the instruction of a more and 
more appreciative circle of serious and thought- 
ful readers. This has done much to improve 
the exposition and to make more practical the 
subject-matter of the academic studies of indus- 
ttial phenomena. Continuous discussion, by 
rendering obsolete portions of the more recent 
works on economic topics, has compelled the 
revision of theory and the re-classification of 
data in order to prevent work from being hope- 
lessly behind the tinies. Conversely, the greater 
interest of academic thinkers in practical prob- 
lems has led journalists and men of affairs to 
gather their scattered writings into permanent 
form, and thereby to render them more avail- 
able to those who had at once less opportunity 
for the first-hand study of events and more 
time for analysis. The three volumes before 
us represent both of these hopeful tendencies, 
two of them being the work of known theorists, 
^he other of a prolific publicist and , practical 
student of finance. 

The past two years have seen notable addi- 
tions to the literature of. Money and Banking. 
Not to mention an output of fugitive writings 
fully up to the average in quality, the appear-

ance of four or five weighty and serious produc- 
tions has marked the period as one of unusual 
importance in the history of this branch of eco- 
nomic writing. Professor Kinley's ' Study of 
the Theory of the Medium of Exchange ' is a 
welcome addition to an honorable list, and the 
same cordial greeting will doubtless be extended 
to one or two other books, by authors of stand- 
ing, now known to be well toward completion. 
All told, the scientific theory of money has 
profited greatly from the attention focussed 
upon it during the two Bryan campaigns ; and 
has profited again from the cessation of the 
contest and the opportunity thereby gained for 
sober and more unbiased thought. 

Professor Kinley's work is a volume of some 
415 duodecimo pages, divided into seventeen 
chapters. These follow the conventional group- 
ing of topics, and hence need no enumeration. 
They fall, in general, into three classes. The 
first includes Chapters I. and II., which deal 
with the origin and idea of money; the second, 
Chapters III. to XV. inclusive, on the various 
phases of metallic money and its problems ; and 
the third. Chapters XVI. and XVII., on con- 
vertible and inconvertible paper money. The 
technical reader is inclined to wish that the 
first and third of these divisions had been 
omitted, — the first because of the more or less 
conjectural and unessential character of the 
data on which such discussions must rest, the 
third because of the need for more extended dis- 
cussion than a chapter or two can afford. But 
what is thus a defect to the specialist will be a 
merit in the eyes of the general observer, who 
may even feel that for his purpose the book 
might well go further and treat the subject of 
Credit and Banking, which the author reserves 
to another volume. Taking the central portion 
of the book, there will be found relatively little 
to quarrel with and much to commend. While 
the treatment necessarily follows beaten pathsy 
it adds its fair share of new thought and 
detailed analysis to problems already much 
hammered upon. 

Probably the most useful bit of originality 
in the book is the consistent application of the 
notion of marginal values to the general value 
of-money question, and indeed to all prob- 
lems throughout the treatment where special 
application of value-theory is requisite. In 
this respect the book is a marked advance over 
some recent work which seems to be based upon 
no consistent doctrine of value. The author's 
conclusions, however, seldom depart from those 
recognized as orthodox, though he is distinctly 
fair to both sides of debated matters. Thus, 
bimetallism is adjudged inadequate in theory,' 
though it * would undeniably offer some advan- 
tages ' ; irredeemable paper currency, on the

whole, is not safely to be meddled with, though 
its issue may result in 'fiscal advant^e' — 
'dearly bought/ however, *by the community,' 
— and a tabular standard of value would * be 
serviceable' in certain cases, though only a 
' rough-and-ready method of returning the 
same amount of physical efficiency/ Professor 
Kinley has doubtless done wisely in omitting 
most of the familiar outlines of American cur- 
rency history which usually appear in works on 
money. 

Probably the chapters to which the theorist 
will turn with most interest are those which 
deal with the 'quantity theory' and the effect 
of credit on prices. This book nominally 
rejects both the stereot}'ped doctrine of the quan- 
tity of money as fixing its value, and the recent 
analyses put forward in rivalry with that 
theory. The stand taken is that 'the value of 
money, as it emerges from any set of exchanges 
is . . . the resultant of a complex group 
of forces,' and after carefid enumeration of 
these forces the conclusion is reached that ' the 
attempt to establish a relation of simple pro- 
portion between the quantity of money and its 
value ' is futile. ' The value of money/ in 
short, 'has some relation to the quantity/ but 
'is not proportional to the quantity excepting 
in the case of inconvertible paper/ and even 
then only subject to some limitation. This 
(except for the inconvertible paper) is certainly 
a sound and wise view of the matter; and, we 
think, is substantially the view now taken by all 
those who consider the money question in an 
unbiased way, without seeking weapons with 
which to belabor others. Unfortunately, like 
most statements of theory which hold only to 
acknowledged truth, it does not take us very 
far; and, indeed, the most serious criticism 
upon Professor Elinley's whole treatment is that 
it leaves many important practical questions 
without definite conclusion. A similar eclectic 
outcome is reached in the chapter on credit and 
its influence upon the price level. The author 
adheres neither to the school which determines 
the price level without referents to money, nor 
to that which regards its increased demand due 
to credit identical in effect with the increased 
demand due to money. ' Credit is properly one 
of the determinants of the price level,' but only 
one. The effect of credit on prices depends on 
the completeness of the cancellation of indebt- 
edness. This theory rests upon the definition 
that exchanges effected by credit mechanism 
represent essentially 'a return to barter by 
representative transfers of goods rather than by 
physical transfers.' So far as such a return 
avoids the necessity for the use of money, it 
sets free a certain amount of coin for use in cash 
payments or as reserves, and this money, — 



practically increasing the stock available for 
use in money-exchanges, — exerts ^whatever 
influence upon the price level can properly be 
attributed to a chan^ in the quantity of money. 
In short, a rearrangement of marginal valua- 
tions is necessitated. Granting the authors 
assumptions, this view seems a distinctly rea- 
sonable explanation of the phenomena of credit, 
and is a welcome relief from recent talk about 
credit as identical with confidence, and from 
definitions of credit as a ' short sale of money/ 

Without going further into the details of this 
book, it may be briefly appreciated as a com- 
pact and concise setting forth of monetary 
theory, ornamented with little in the way of 
allusion or history, and illustrated scantily, but 
based upon careful study of the recent as well 
as the older works on the subject. The origi- 
nality of the book does not lie in newness of 
material, but in method of treatment, and the 
conclusions are throughout eclectic It should 
prove a useful volume both for the class room 
and for popular circulation. 

l^Ir. Conanf s work on ' Wall Street and the 
Country' is confessedly an apology for the 
* financial interests,* and an effort to demon- 
strate the latent harmony between the promoters 
and financiers of New York and the plain citi- 
zens throughout the land. With this object in 
view, the book aims to ' set forth in some degree 
. the dangers of proceeding too rashly 
in extending the area of Federal intervention, 
and in fettering that freedom of 
action and initative which has been one of the 
essential causes of our national progress.' Six 
essays are included in the volume, and of these 
the first three and the last serve the main end, 
the fourth and the fifth being more general in 
character. Probably the most interesting and 
informing essay of the set is the one on ' The 
Future of Undigested Securities ' ; and Mr. 
Conant has done rightly in giving it first place. 
The author believes that the sufferings inflicted 
upon the public through the over-capitalization 
and inflation of recent corporate enterprises are 
to be attributed largely to public gullibility and 
only in part to the promoters. Kecalling the 
unfortunate experiences of the early days of 
joint-stock companies, he points out that present 
conditions are analogous to the older experi- 
ence, and suggests that what is needed is not 
new legislation, but 'to apply to industrial 
trusts . . . the lesson so well learned in 
the school of experience in railroading and 
banking.' The stronger and better organized of 
the new corporations will stand the test to 
which they are now being subjected, while the 
others will share the fate of our wildcat banks 
of the ante-bellum davs. In his chapter on 
' The Trusts and the Public,' Mr. Conant finds

that the dangers of govemmeiit regulation far 
overtop those of oppression and abuse by the 
mammoth corporations. 'Intelligent discus- 
sion^ he welcomes, and suggests that 'within 
the states corporation laws can probably be 
improved in many cases in the interest of the 
investor.' But to the consumer he has little to 
say except that 'in the nation, perhaps, some 
simple laws might be enacted for the protection 
of the consumer without disturbing the rights 
of the shareholder.' A lengthy elaboration of 
the classical economic argument for speculation 
is given in the essay on ' The Function of the 
Stock and Produce Exchanges.' This, like the 
other essays, is chiefly a defense of existing 
methods of financial manipulation, and a gentle 
effort to obscure some of the more repulsive 
aspects of modern finance. ' The Economic 
Progress of the Century ' is different in tone 
from the other essays. It is a review of some 
of the economic factors which have contributed 
to recent industrial advance, and seems to have 
less of the character of a special plea than its 
companion pieces. Perhaps no higher compli- 
ment could be paid this essay than to say that 
it is somewhat in the style of the late David 
A. Wells's 'Recent Economic Changes.' 

Mr. Conant's method, — and, it is not unfair 
to add, somewhat of his special bias, — may be 
seen to good advantage in the paper on ' A G-old 
Standard for China.' Admirably clear is this 
little monograph in its re-statement of the fa- 
miliar reasons why Western producers would be 
benefited by the adoption of a stable money by 
China, as well as in its explanation of the modes 
by which the costly and difficult undertaking 
must be carried through. What Mr. Conant 
neglects to lay stress upon, however, is the 
special interests behind our apparent display of 
national altruism and good feeling in pushing 
the plan forward. The ' Gold Standard for 
China ' turns out to be a gold standard with a 
silver circulation, yet there is nowhere a clear 
recognition of the fact that our silver product 
is now chiefly controlled by a single interest, 
very powerful at Washington, and that the 
adoption of the project would mean a great 
increase in the demand for this metal and con- 
sequently an increase in its price. Our experi- 
ence in getting silver for the Philippines fur- 
nishes an interesting illustration of the effects 
that would flow from such an operation, and 
of the profits that would swell certain favored 
pockets. 

On the whole, Mr. Conant's little book is use- 
ful and interesting, if read with due care and 
discretion. Its best feature is the clear depic- 
tion of many current conditions on which the 
general reader has scant opportunity to inform 
himself; its worst, the ex parte character already 



referred to, and the failure to bring into relief 
important facts which might materially change 
the opinion of the reader if known. 

Professor Carver's book on ' The Distribution 
of Wealth ' is a discussion of the abstract prin- 
ciples upon which the product of industry is 
divided. It had been anticipated by some as a 
book that would break new ground, and by 
others as a sharp critical review of the distribu- 
tion controversy that began some fifteen years 
or more ago. Tlie author evidently regards his 
own work as a bit of hard reading, for he ' hopes 
that the reader who takes up the volume will do 
so with the understanding that economics is a 
science rather than a branch of polite litera- 
ture.' By way of fitting it for use as a text, 
collateral reading in the standard authors on 
economic theory is suggested at the end of each 
chapter. 

None of the expectations concerning ' The 
Distribution of Wealth' seem to be justified. 
Quite sound and classical (in the modern sense 
of that term), for the most part, there is little 
or none of the critical review of recent theory 
already referred to, and we are glad to say that 
we cannot accept Professor Carver's foreboding 
of difficulty in reading the volume. On the 
contrary, there are numerous places where con- 
densation might be resorted to without at all 
rendering the treatment too abstruse or difficult 
to follow. The book is in the main a clear and 
careful re-statement of the prevalent ideas on 
the theory of distribution as now accepted. 
The formal division of the treatment follows 
conventional lines with chapters on Value, 
Diminishing Returns, Forms of Wealth, Wages, 
Rent, Interest, and Profits. In the chapter on 
Interest, the point of view accepted by the 
author is developed along typical lines. Inter- 
est, says Professor Carver, is ' the income which 
capital returns to its owner, whether he lends 
it or employs it himself in his business.' It is 
the surplus earning over and above the amount 
needed to replace losses and repair wear-and- 
tear. Capital is enabled to earn such an income 
simply because its material forms are useful, 
and this essentially justifies the ' productivity ' 
theory precisely as a similar fact in the case of 
labor accounts for and measures the productive- 
ness of that economic agent. Producers' goods 
make up the significant categories of capital, 
and these are subject to a law of marginal pro- 
ductivity which dictates the proportion in which 
they will be combined with land and labor in 
productive processes. But any accoamt of the 
productiveness of capital, — or, in other words, 
any theory of interest, — must take account of 
the supply of the agent as well as of the demand 
for it. Demand is fully explained by the doc- 
trine of marginal productivity, but not so of 



1905.] 



THE DIAL. 



267 



supply. Such supply is controlled by two fac- 
tors — the cost of producing the capital and the 
necessity of waiting for a more or less slow 
return. The dislike of such waiting gives rise 
to the payment called interest. This waiting 
or saving is, in final analysis, the placing of 
capital in productive forms, as machinery, etc. 
Such saving does not, always and everywhere, 
involve sacrifice, but the saving of enough capi- 
tal to carry on industry does do so. Hence the 
amount of interest paid does not correspond to 
a general discounting of future consumption, 
but to a marginal sacrifice or discounting. An 
equilibrium between demand for and supply of 
capital is arrived at when the purchaser's (bor- 
rower's) demand for different forms of capital 
gives them a value just equal to their marginal 
cost of production. Land seems to yield inter- 
est on principles precisely similar, yet the inde- 
structible elements involved are such as to war- 
rant a separate theory of rent. Capital varies 
much in its durability, and different countries 
and ages vary widely in the strength of the sav- 
ing spirit, and hence in the marginal sacrifice 
of abstinence. It is conceivable that interest 
might disappear, owing to a decline in such 
marginal sacrifice to zero; but no such result is 
likely to occur. The ' justice ' of interest is a 
question of political expediency, and on that 
basis may be upheld, since without it capital 
would be scarcer and what there was would be 
less ably managed. 

This specimen of the mode of reasoning 
employed in 'The Distribution of Wealth' is 
representative. A similar plan is pursued in 
the other sections, and generally the application 
of the doctrine of marginal sacrifices figures 
throughout as the leading principle. Yet there 
is everywhere apparent an effort to keep the 
valuable elements in conflicting doctrines new 
and old, and to harmonize them where possible. 
The book is moderate in tone and in conclu- 
sions. Some critics of Professor Carver have 
accused him of * circuity ' in treatment. It 
would not be worth while to recall the shadowy 
refinements upon which this charge must be 
based. The subject itself is one in which cer- 
tain assumptions must be made, and to these 
the reasoning naturally and unavoidably 
returns. Only by eliminating the whole theory 
of distribution, — as suggested by one critic, — 
will such a ' danger ' be avoided. Professor 
Carver has furnished a sensible and readable 
summary of theory on an abstract phase of eco- 
nomies, — a phase, too, that is lately falling 
into disrepute. It should do something to 
improve the status of this field of study. We 
note in conclusion that the proofs of the book 
have been carefully read, but that some of its 
mechanical features are not the publishers' best.

Memoirs of a Traveller and 
Oriextalist.* 



M. Arminius Yambery, already well known 
through former publications, some concerned 
with interesting public events in his career and 
some more intimately personal, has gathered 
into two volimies a number of the de- 
tails, both public and personal, not in- 
cluded in his previous works, and has 
given to the book the double title of 
' The Story of My Struggles : The Memoirs of 
Arminius Vambery.' His purpose is stated 
quite frankly, and the book may be taken as 
supplementing all that he has written not 
avowedly scientific in its nature. Where his 
earlier books have exhausted his reminiscences, 
as in the case of those describing the wonderful 
journey that he made into Central Asia in the 
disguise of a dervish, the mention here is merely 
passing and for the purpose of setting the event 
in its due chronological place. In other re- 
spects, particularly in his recollections of his 
earlier years, and in specifying his services to 
the cause of Great Britain in Asia, the treat- 
ment is remarkably fuU. 

It is in this latter respect that the interest of 
the narrative will be found to reside chiefly. 
M. Vambery is an extraordinary example of 
what one man may accomplish by writing to 
the newspapers, — an art and practice gener- 
ally unknown in the United States, greatly to 
the country's loss. It is no exaggeration what- 
ever to say that M. Vambery's letters to the 
London * Times ' have played no small part in 
changing the map of the world. He returned 
from his expedition in Central Asia with an 
amount of knowledge concerning those parts 
exceeding that of any other European. He had 
acquired perfect command of the Turkish lan- 
guage and literature, and with this a surpris- 
ing fund of information about the government 
and politics of the Ottoman empire. Persia, 
too, was an open book to him, and his history 
of Bokhara is the standard work on that little 
understood people after many years. Adding 
his special means of information through an 
active correspondence with public men in the 
Orient, and, most amazing of aU, something 
resembling intimacy with the reigning Sultan, 
and it will be seen how valuable his letters

might become, once he had firmly committed 
himself to the cause of Great Britain as the one 
civilizing and enlightening agent of that por- 
tion of the world, his attitude as a freedom- 
loving Hungarian giving him a complementary 
hatred for Russia and her methods. 

Born a Jew, M, Vambery's account of his 
boyhood and youth sets forth the bitterness of 
the prejudice against that remarkable race in 
Hungary and throughout the Austrian empire, 
— a prejudice hardly yet removed in his indi- 
vidual case, and then only from his countrymen 
having learned of the esteem in which he is 
held by the world outside. It also exemplifies 
the loyalty of the Jew to his brethren, whereby 
the widow's son in the depths of poverty was 
freely accorded, through the years of his educa- 
tion, such aid as was possible from those only 
less poor than himself. After the customary 
training of the orthodox son of Israel in the 
Scriptures and their commentaries, including 
an amount of learning by rote that must have 
had some effect in developing his extraordinary 
memory, his schooling fell into the hands of the 
Roman Catholic priests. The result was to 
leave him a pronounced skeptic in all that per- 
tains to revealed religion, and the following 
passage indicates his subsequent attitude : 

'As will appear from the following pages of this 
work, it was for the most part religion, the product 
of divine inspiration and the supposed means for 
ennobling and raising mankind, which made me feel 
the baseness of humanity most acutely; and from 
my cradle to my old age, in Europe as well as in 
Asia, among those of the highest culture as well as 
amid the crudest barbarism, I have found fanati- 
cism and narrow-mindedness, malice and injustice, 
emanating mostly from the religious people, and 
always on behalf of religion! ' 

Considered in the light of his real attain- 
ments and solid contributions to the world's 
knowledge of its people and their spoken 
tongues, M. Vambery's apologies for his lack 
of a thorough grounding in the humanities 
sound strange, and are likely to provoke the 
inquiry whether more learning of the ascer- 
tained sort would not have left him less able to 
make original contributions to the general 
store. It is made clear that he hit upon Turk- 
ish as the field in which to exhibit his talents 
for research because of its kinship to Hun- 
garian ; and when he had all that Europe could 
give him, in his state of almost complete desti- 
tution, he embarked upon the journey to Con- 
stantinople which colored the rest of his life. 
There he set about learning the cultivated 
speech and literature, until he found himself, 
within a comparatively short time, generally 
accorded the position of an 'Effendi,' — that 
is, a fully accredited Turk. His interest in 
the beginnings of the language led him into his 
expedition to the former home of the Othraans, 



where he had to pass for montlis in his artificial 
character as a true believer. His recital of his 
physical sufferings at this time must excite sym- 
pathy from every reader, while his mental tor- 
tures were still more acute. 

One anecdote illustrating oriental shrewd- 
ness is certainly worth giving, the occurrence 
taking place while M. Vambery was at Erze- 
roum as the guest of Hussein Daim Pasha. 

' One day the Pasha lost a valuable diamond ring, 
and as he had not been out of the house one might 
justly suppose that the ring would be found, unless 
one of the numerous servants of the establishment 
had made away with it. As all investigations were 
fruitless, Hidayet Effendi sent for a celebrated 
wonder-working Sheikh, who squatted down in the 
middle of the great entrance hall, where all the 
servants were assembled. I impatiently waited the 
issue of events. At last the Sheikh, sitting cross- 
legged, produced from under his mantle a black 
cock, and holding it in his lap he invited all the 
servants, each in turn, to come up to him, stroke 
the cock softly, and straightway put his hand into 
his pocket; then, said the Sheikh, the cock, without 
any more ado, will declare who is the thief by 
crowing. When all the servants had passed in turn 
before the Sheikh, and touched the cock, he told 
them all to hold out their hands. All hands were 
black, with the exception of one, which had re- 
mained white, and whose owner was at once desig- 
nated as the thief. The cock had been blackened 
all over with coal dust, and as the thief, fearing de- 
tection, had avoided touching him, his hand had 
remained white, and consequently his guilt was 
declared. The servant received his punishment, and 
the Sheikh his reward.' 

The autobiographer himself is occasionally 
lost in surprise at his own advancement, and 
the reader will share the feeling with him more 
than once. It is only a chapter or two from the 
scene just depicted, when he writes of his stay 
at Lord Houghton's country seat, after he had 
been invited to England for the purpose of lec- 
turing and attending to the publication of his 
first book, the account running thus : 

'During one visit there I made the acquaintance 
of such celebrities as Lord Lytton, afterwards 
Viceroy of India; the poet Algernon Swinburne, 
who used to read to us passages of his yet unpub- 
lished poem, "Atalanta in Calydon," over which 
the slender youth went into ecstasies; and last, but 
not least, of Burton, just returned from a mission 
in the North-West of Africa. Burton — later Sir 
Eichard Burton — was to spend his honeymoon under 
the hospitable roof of the genial Lord Houghton. 
The company, amongst which Madame Mohl, the 
wife of the celebrated Orientalist, Jules Mohl, spe- 
cially attracted my attention, had met here in honor 
of Burton, the great traveller, and as he was the 
last to arrive, Lord Houghton planned the follow- 
ing joke: I was to leave the drawing-room before 
Burton appeared with his young wife, hide behind 
one of the doors, and at a given sign recite the first 
"Sura" of the Koran with correct Moslem intona- 
tion. I did as arranged. Burton went through every 
phase of surprise, and jumping up from his seat ex- 
claimed, "That is VambSry! " although he had 
never seen or heard me before.'

frankness, with an occasional bit of self-depre- 
ciation which has always some purpose in view. 
For instance, he observes that his early training 
in Hungary was of the kind that prepared 
him for his experiences in the East, adding, 

'The difference between the condition of a poor 
Jew-boy and a mendicant dervish in central Asia 
is, after all, not very great. The cravings of hun- 
ger are not one whit easier to bear or less irksome 
in cultured Europe than in the Steppes of Asia, and 
the mental agony of the little Jew, despised and 
mocked by the Christian world, is perhaps harder 
than the constant fear of being found out by fanat- 
ical Mohammedans.' 

The book is interesting in many ways, as the 
foregoing extracts show more plainly, perhaps, 
than any comment makes possible. It sets 
forth a long, industrious, and honorable career, 
filled with achievement of no mean order and 
not yet closed. Being interestingly told, and 
by one who learned to write in English late in 
life, there can be no good result from criticiz- 
ing its style. But it both needs and deserves an 
index, in addition to the summary of previous 
works from the same hand which is added as 
an appendix. Wallace Rice.

In a substantial volume of seven hundred

Henderson has brought together a valuable 
series of papers on the administration of pub- 
lic and private charity in the principal coun- 
tries of the world. For Unrty years, as the 
preface states, he has been engaged in collect-

assistance of students and other friends. As 
the inquiry extended beyond mere statutes and 
forms of organization to the actual workings 
of the systems of poor-relief in various coun- 
tries, the collection of information was a for- 
midable task. Professor Henderson himself 
writes of Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and 
Norway, Italy, Scotland, Canada, and (with 
the collaboration of Professor E. C. Hayes) 
Austria-Hungary; Dr. Charles A. Ellwood 
writes of public relief and private charity in 
England; Professor J. M. Gillette treats of 
Ireland and Denmark; Dr. 0. J. Price of 
India and Australasia; Professor Eomanzo 
Adams of Holland; Dr. Annie Marion Mac- 
Lean of France; Mr. Eben Mumford of Bel-

Macmlllan Co. 



The charity of the Jews in Europe and Amer- 
ica is described by Rabbi Morris M. Feuer- 
licht and Rabbi A. Hirschberg. The long 
chapter on the United States is divided among 
several contributors: Professor C. J. BushneU 
writes statistically of the causes and condi- 
tions of social need, and of the extent, con- 
ditions, law, and administration of public re- 
lief in the various states; Miss Florence Ash- 
craft describes the charitable work of socie- 
ties of women, the social settlements, and the 
Red Cross, and the work done for the pro- 
tection of children and youth; Dr. F. G. 
Cressey sketches the interesting social work 
of the Salvation Army and the Volunteers of 
America; and Professor Henderson fills in the 
gaps with sections on voluntary and ecclesias- 
tical charity, indoor relief, the treatment of 
vagrants, medical relief, defectives, preven- 
tive measures (such as free employment 
bureaus, workingmen*s insurance, provident 
loans, and care of discharged prisoners and 
their families), and cooperation of charitable 
agencies through Charity Organization Socie- 
ties, etc. The inclusion of paragraphs on city 
play-grounds, industrial schools, and other edu- 
cational efforts show that charity is conceived 
as something more than almsgiving. 

The value of this monographic work is 
vastly increased because it is inspired by a 
common purpose, unified by a common plan, 
and brought together in a single volume by an 
author-editor peculiarly well fitted for the 
task. Professor Henderson has a much more 
practical knowledge of charitable matters than 
most college professors have of the subjects 
they teach; in him, indeed, the theoretical and 
the practical are almost ideally united. One 
is tempted to wish that he had somewhat mag- 
nified his editorial fimction and supplied a 
summary making clear the trend of modem 
philanthropic effort. But perhaps this is tiie 
wish of the dilletante or of the book-reviewer 
only; there is something to be said in favor 
of the old-fashioned plan of reading a book 
through instead of merely skimming through 
the introduction and conclusion, and those who 
read it should be able to draw their own gen- 
eralizations. Charity workers are apt to be 
busy people, but they will find this book well 
worth reading through. 

If this review is little more than a table of 
contents, it has at least supplied the most 
conspicuous lack of the volume ' reviewed, 
whose table of contents is only a list of coun- 
tries. A somewhat more analytical list of top- 
ics is needed to exhibit the richness and vari- 
ety of the subject-matter and to make the 
book useful for ready reference, although 
there is a fairly good index. Max West.

Recent Books on Education.* 



In no field of educational research has there 
been a larger crop of monographs during the 
last decade than in the department of American 
education. Hitherto no available summary of 
this recent work was to be had. Now Dr. 
Edwin Grant Dexter, of the University of Illi- 
nois, comes forward to supply the need in a 
volume of six hundred pages entitled 'A His- 
tory of Education in the United States.' His 
purpose, as he explains it in his preface, is *to 
supply the student a considerable mass of defi- 
nite fact . . . rather than extended 
philosophical discussions of historical trend.' 
With the exception of the first fifty pages, the 
method of treatment is exclusively topical ; each 
state in the union is sketched briefly, sometimes 
in less than a page. The body of the book con- 
sists of closely-written chapters on elementary 
education, public secondary education, school 
organization text books, colleges and universi- 
ties, professional education, technical and agri- 
cultural education, the preparation of teachers, 
art and manual training, commercial education, 
and the education of women, to mention only 
the most important topics. In these chapters 
Dr. Dexter devotes a few paragraphs to the early 
history, and then masses the facts showing the 
trend of present development. This portion 
of the work, particularly the handling of sta- 
tistics, is skilfully done. Only the really sig- 
nificant figures have been selected. Many of 
the historical sketches of education in the dif- 
ferent states are weak and perfunctory; the 
amount of space is too limited, and frequently 
two-thirds of the space is given over to an 
account of the first teacher and where the first 
school house was located, to the neglect of really

significant facts. In such states as Indiana, 
Michigan, North Carolina, and California, the 
characteristic events which show the individu- 
ality of the system and its growth are entirely 
omitted. Another objection that can justly be 
urged applies to the title rather than the con- 
tents of Dr. Dexter's volume. In no sense is 
it a history of education in the United States; 
there is no unity, whole episodes in the history 
of education are absent as are also the majority 
of the important personalities. A more accu- 
rate title would have been ' A Historical Ency- 
clopaedia of American Education.' 

The centenary of the inauguration of the 
movement for free public schools in the city of 
New York has suggested the need of a general 
historical sketch of the system, and such a 
sketch has been written by Mr. A. Emerson 
Palmer, secretary of the New York school 
board. The author describes his work as ' a 
fairly complete chronicle rather than a philo- 
sophic history.' He thus parries the most seri- 
ous criticism that can be made, — namely, 
that the book treats only of surface events and 
that the significance of the events chronicled is 
not shown. Mr. Palmer is well informed on 
his own subject, but he appears to know little 
or nothing of the development of other city 
systems. The title-page informs the reader 
that this history is authorized by the New York 
board of education, which fact may account for 
the somewhat gingerly discussion of several 
recent movements in organization. Not with- 
standing these limitations, the book meets a dis- 
tinct need, and every student of American edu- 
cation would welcome similarly comprehensive 
sketches of the growth of public education in 
Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other 
centres of population. 

Books treating of school supervision from the 
formal or official side of systems and laws, have 
been sufficiently numerous; a work, however, 
describing the management of schools as they 
actually are managed, is something of a novelty. 
This latter is the task that Superintendent Wil- 
liam E. Chancellor, of Bloomfield, New Jersey, 
has undertaken to perform in his recent volume, 
' Our Schools, their Administration and Super- 
vision.' The immediate aim of the author ha^ 
been to provide a manual of advice for teachers 
entering the profession of the school super- 
tendency. Such topics as boards of education, 
the superintendent, the principal, graded sys- 
tems of schools, state systems, the private school, 
the new education, and the educational policy 
of the community are dealt with from the point 
of view of the school administrator. An appen- 
dix of more than fifty pages contains reprints 
of the blank forms necessary in the administra- 
tion of city schools. As a guide to the novice,

the work will undoubtedly prove useful ; but its 
greatest value is iu an entirely different direc- 
tion ; as a study in social control, it is a master- 
piece. How boards of education are managed, 
how public sentiment can be created and 
brought to bear on them, when the 
superintendent should be bold and when 
not too bold, — these are the topics dealt 
with by Mr. Chancellor in a manner 
that might almost be described as fascinat- 
ing. Pari; of the interest lq these discussions 
is due to the large number of specific cases 
which the author cites. Another source of 
strength, though of inferior importance, is 
found in his acquaintance with modem eco- 
nomics, sociology, and pedagog}'. The book is 
equally free from the patriotic gloss of the pro- 
fessional politician and the hysterics of the pro- 
fessional reformer; it recognises frankly the 
weak spots in our city systems and the difficul- 
ties that confront the superintendent. Any one 
interested in knowing the schools as part of the 
social machinery of tiie countrv- will find the 
work profitable. 

Inspector William H. Winch of the English 
elementary schools endeavors to apply an exact 
standard of measurement to the intellectual 
results accomplished in the schools of different 
countries. ' Xotes on German Schools ' is the 
title of his first work in this direction. The 
volume, in the main, contains accurate and 
detailed descriptions of lessons observed by the 
author in a four months' tour of inspection in 
Germany. In the case of each lesson described, 
all the obtaining conditions (such as age of 
pupil, grade, number in class, preparation, and 
time devoted to that particular branch) are 
stated. The subjects covered in separate chap- 
ters are arithmetic, the language arts, history, 
geography, modem languages, elementary 
science, drawing, physical exercises, and sing- 
ing. The resulting volume lacks the charm and 
picturesque features of some American books on 
the same subject, but is a more useful and solid 
contribution for serious students. 

Critics who complain that in America philos- 
ophy is simply an academic luxury remote 
from the real interests of life should read 
Thomas Davidson's posthumous volume, 'The 
Education of the Wage-Earners,' which con- 
tains the record of a unique experiment among 
the Russian Jews of Xew York City. As the 
result of a challenge at the close of a lecture, 
Professor Davidson organized a class composed 
almost exclusively of wage-earners from the 
tenement houses. With them, he successively 
studied the history of civilization, modem lit- 
erature, and the history of philosophy. In 
spite of broken English, poor facilities for 
study, and the exhaustion from excessive physi- 



cal labor, these students threw themselves into 
the courses with surprising intellectual vigor 
and enthusiasm, which has been continued 
through a series of years, even after the death 
of the founder. This result is a striking con- 
firmation of one of the founder's theories, viz., 
that the true students of the age are not found 
in universities, largely supported by the idle 
sons of the rich, but in the factories and work- 
shops. The volume, which is edited by Mr. 
Charles M. Bakewell, contains a brief biography 
and characterization of Professor Davidson by 
the editor; two of the original lectures of the 
course; the history of the movement, written 
by Professor Davidson, together with his letters 
to the class showing the underlying spirit of tiie 
movement. 

A new volume of addresses or lay sermons 
by Dean Briggs of Harvard follows the lines of 
his previous book, * School, College, and Char- 
acter,' in its attitude toward fundamental col- 
lege problems. Its contents, however, are more 
miscellaneous in character, containing as it 
does the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa poem for 
1903 and the address to the school children of 
Concord on the hundredth anniversary of the 
birth of Emerson, as well as the addresses on 
college topics. I)ean Briggs does not retract 
his scepticism concerning modem methods in 
higher education, so well phrased in the title 
of one of his previous address^, * Old Fash- 
ioned Doubts concerning Xew Fashioned Edu- 
cation.' He preaches the gospel of routine, 
of complete mastery of the automatic side of 
living, as a prime requisite in education. His 
most inspiring chapters are those treating the 
moral and social side of modem college life, 
where his wide experience lend weight and 
insight to his words. He is also unusually for- 
tunate in his illustrative stories. Admiration 
of the author's style should not blind the reader 
to his essentially one-sided presentation of an 
intricate subject. With a sure hand, the weak- 
nesses arising from the elasticity and individu- 
alism of the newer methods in higher education 
are laid bare, but nothing is said of the initia- 
tion into scientific method, the intellectual 
maturity and philosophic spirit which these 
same methods have secured to the abler and 
more serious-minded students. 

Twenty-three of the recent utterances of 
President William E. Harper have been gath- 
ered into a volume called ' The Trend in Higher 
Education.' The majority of the chapters, 
including all those of importance, discuss either 
coUege and university questions or religious and 
theological education. The articles, with the 
exception of some brief occasional addresses, 
are vital and frank almost to the point 
of blimtness, — there is no tendency to

call a spade an agricultural implement. 
At the same time, the treatment is fair, 
and no attempt is made to criticize a 
particular institution by insinuation. Dr. 
Harper takes a vigorous and business-like 
attitude, modem but not radical, and his gen- 
eral conclusions are likely to be more widely 
accepted by the university men of the country 
than those of any other writer in recent years. 
The strongest chapters are ' Waste in Higher 
Education,' which should be sent to every board 
of regents or trustees in the country, 'How 
Shall the Theological Curriculum be Modified,' 
and * The Situation in the Small College.' The 
first chapter, ' Democracy and Education,' does 
not afford President Harper's preeminently 
objective mind as good an opportunity to dis- 
play itself to advantage as many of the later 
themes. Some of the minor topics treated are 
teachers, salaries, endowment C)f college 
athletics, Latin versus science, coeducation, the 
three years' course, and luxury among college 
students. 

Both President King of Oberlin, in his 
volume entitled ' Personal and Ideal Elements 
in Education,' and Dr. George A. Hubbell, in 
his book called *Up through Childhood,' 
endeavor to apply the results of modem 
psychology to moral and religious education. 
President King writes for the scholar a con- 
servative interpretation of the results gained by 
men like Coe, Starbuck, and Leuba in their 
researches concerning the psychology of con- 
version and allied themes. If the basis of his 
careful and well-wrought argument is some- 
times wider than the application to concrete 
problems, this apparent discrepancy is to be 
accounted for by the form of the chapters, which 
were first delivered as papers before religious 
conventions, where striking and concrete con- 
clusions are urgently demanded. The volume 
contains President King's inaugural address, 
another plea for the retention of the old-time 
college course. Dr. Hubbell writes in a popu- 
lar style for a much wider audience. His book 
reads like a number of bright Y. M. C. A. talks 
strung together with some appearance of system. 
It abounds in excellent stories and familiar 
verse, and contains much eloquence. N'o better 
book on religious pedagogy for the average Sun- 
day school teacher has been written. It is 
readable, fearless in its discussion of present 
conditions, and embodies many of the typical 
ideas of the last decade. 

Child study is rapidly emerging from the 
monographic period to a stage characterized by 
general summaries and interpretations. The 
latest venture in the latter direction is a vol- 
ume written by Miss Amy Eliza Tanner, for- 
merly of the University of Chicago, and 



entitled 'The Child, his Thinking, Feeling, 
and Doing.' The book is designed for the 
teacher and the mother. The author avoids 
technical terms and speculative discussions;, 
facts in great abundance have been supplied, 
together with bibliographies suificiently com- 
plete to confuse the average mother or teacher 
who is not also a trained student. Inasmuch 
as the majority of readers ignore bibliographies, 
however, no great amount of damage will result. 
The arrangement of chapters lacks any psycho- 
logical or logical basis. For normal or college 
students who should have some groundwork in 
general psychology before studying child psy- 
chology. Miss Tanner's book is inferior to that 
of Dr. Kirkpatrick; for general readers it will 
prove more serviceable.

Mr. Gosse'a 
estimate of 
Patmore. 



Barely a decade has passed since 
the death of Coventry Patmore, 
and already his work lies more in 
shadow than that of any other well-known poet 
of his generation. Mr. Edmund Gosse, writing of 
Patmore in the series of 'Literary Lives' (Scrib- 
ner), prophesies that the shadow will soon pas& 
and that Patmore 's reputation will grow steadily 
in the future until it reaches a position as secure,, 
if not as eminent, as that now held by Tennyson,. 
Browning, and Matthew Arnold. Mr. Gosse 's biog- 
raphy is highly interesting; explaining much that 
is mysterious in Patmore 's poetry through the 
strange personality of the poet, the biographer 
adds something of distinct value to the critical 
estimate. But his conclusions are at least open 
to debate. As Mr. Gosse himself says, Patmore- 
was the type of the moral and intellectual aristo- 
crat; he arrogated to himself an independence of 
thought and action not in harmony with modern 
theories of social welfare. Moreover, his ideals^ 
both personal and literary, were above his powers 
of realization. The result of all this seems, to- 
an outsider unbiassed by personal admiration for 
Patmore, consistent with the facts as they are. 
Patmore is dead, and with him died the inspira- 
tion of his presence, the impulse of his strong 
and aggressive individuality, and the charm of 
his poetry. Patmore 's poetry was Patmore trans- 
lated into verse, mystically simple, inconsistent,, 
incomplete. Even 'The Angel in the House' is 
fragmentary, and great reputations are not built 
on fragments. If he is to be remembered it will 
be as the friend of great men, the early idol of the 
Preraphaelites. He started thoroughly abreast of 
his times, but he did not care to forge ahead 
with the rest, and Avas only angered when others 
insisted that the goal had not been reached. Still, 
it is something to have been considered an enemy 
Avorth fighting, and the records show a famous 
quarrel for almost every famous friendship. It 
is almost impossible to consider Patmore 's poetry

apart from Patmore. 'The Azalea' is perfect, so 
are other little things and small parts of some 
of the bigger things; then all is said. 

An efficient A. text-book has a possibility to

Psychology. jjj ^ particular section of the intel- 
lectual domain second only to that of the teacher. 
And the requirements demanded of teacher and 
text alike are many, complex, and strenuous. 
Tact, insight, judgment, taste, and a nice feeling 
for compromise amid the emphasis of the essen- 
tials, are all to be exercised without dogmatism, 
without sacrifice of a helpful effort on the part of 
the learner or of enthusiasm on the part of the 
teacher. The new-bom change ia the interpreta- 
tion of subject-matter and of the spirit of the 
teacher has humanized and naturalized the text- 
book. No discipline has profited by, and in turn 
inspired, this consummation more than that of 
psychology; and since James any one who issues 
a dull or unreadable book on psychology does so 
at his peril. Besides readability, such a text 
should inspire effort and lead to effective absorp- 
tion of new ideas. In this aspect its success de- 
pends upon system, point of view, and the sus- 
tained capacity of the author. In all these re- 
spects, and everywhere with distinctive success, 
the volume recently issued by Professor J. R. 
Angell passes a critical examination. The text 
is readable, the doctrine sound, the teaching effect- 
ive. It achieves these merits by judicious se- 
lections and omissions, by emphasis of the im- 
portant and a sufficient indication of the details 
to make a life-like picture. The points of great- 
est emphasis are the importance of the functional, 
active, effective processes in the world of mind, 
the instructive sidelights that are obtained when 
we study such functions as a growth and note 
how such processes came to be, and how differ- 
ently they are distributed in the varieties of 
mental experience. The strength of the book is 
in the descriptions of the higher and more com- 
plex forms of the mental product, those in which 
perception, memory, attention, and the formation 
of concepts play the major part. The introduc- 
tory accounts of the source of the material upon 
which the mind works, and of its relations with a 
nervous system, while adequate, are for many pur- 
poses too condensed, and too summary to balance 
well with the more adequate and congenial treat- 
ment of what comes later. Yet in all, and for 
the purposes of the general introductory course 
in our college psychology, the book has distinctly 
greater adaptiveness and promise of eflBciency, 
with fewer shortcomings, than almost any other 
book that has recently been put forth to meet the 
needs of those young minds about to be ac- 
quainted with the natural history of the mental 
life. (Holt.) '

is to-day held in honored remembrance, while it 
is not twenty years since this library (with the 
Philadelphia Library as a whole) was imder the 
care of its donor's great-great-grandson, the late 
Lloyd P. Smith. It was the latter 's great-grand- 
father, John Smith, who wooed and won the 
beautiful, virtuous, and accomplished Hannah 
Logan; and the fortunate lover's diary, still pre- 
served to the extent of three-quarters of its 
original bulk by the late librarian 's sister, is now 
drawn upon by Mr. Albert Cook Mvers, the editor 
of 'Sally Wister's Journal,' for a quaint and 
pleasing account of this old-time courtship. Intro- 
duction, footnotes, appendix, views, portraits, 
and facsimiles, all attest the antiquarian zeal 
Mr. Myers has brought to the execution of his 
task; and the result is a volume exceedingly 
attractive to students of our colonial history, and 
not unattractive to the general reader. The prom- 
inence of the characters concerned — James Logan 
being at one time acting governor of Penn- 
sylvania, and John Smith Assemblyman of the 
same province and afterward King's Councillor 
of New Jersey — adds to the historic interest of 
the diary. As a specimen of the diarist's style,

ceremony that made Hannah Logan his wife.

The field of modem Irish history 
inTte^uii^ ^^s long been permitted to he fal- 
low ; only here and there, and par- 
ticularly where it directly touches the English 
field, has much genuine work been done. 
Recently, however, Mr. C. Litton Falkiner, an 
enthusiastic student of the Irish past, has begun a 
systematic study of the history of the whcJe 
island, and, especially on the social and topograph- 
ical side. In his earlier ' Studies ' he gives us a pic- 
ture of Ireland in the eighteenth century; in his 
later work, 'Illustrations of Irish History' (Long- 
mans), he takes us back to the seventeenth. The 
book is in two parts: the first is a collection of 
papers — 'by-products of historical research' — 
dealing with various subjects, most of which, 
however, concern the early history of Dublin. To 
the historical student these papers have distinct 
value; but the general reader will find them any- 
thing but inspiring. Of far greater importance 
and interest is the second part, which is a collec- 
tion of source materials, descriptions of Ireland 
by officials and travellers who visited or lived jn 
the country during the Stuart period. As the 
greater part of these were written by royal offi- 
cials, matters are naturally seen from the Eng- 
lish point of view ; and the narrators find much

to censure, especially in popular customs and 
religious observances. Nevertheless, taken together 
they form a picture of Irish society in the six- 
teenth century that is clear and vivid, though 
somewhat exaggerated and unsympathetic. The 
editor's notes explanatory of Celtic terms and 
obsolete place-names are all the reader can desire. 
Some of the essays in Part I., such as those in 
which the author discusses the woods and the 
counties of Ireland, also give considerable help 
toward a proper understanding of these contem- 
porary accounts. It should be added that a large 
part of this material, particularly certain chap- 
ters of Tynes Moryson's Itinerary,' had lain in 
manuscript form till within the last few years, a 
few sections being printed in this work for the 
first time. In publishing a book such as this, Mr. 
Falkiner does the cause of history a service; it is 
only to be regretted that he has found himself 
unable to include a few extracts from writers 
more in sympathy with the Irish people and their 
struggles to maintain their nationality and their 

faith. 

It is well for the title of a book to 

le^rZ'^ce!'''* ^^« ^ f^i^ly accurate idea of its 
contents. When one reads the 
title, 'How to Know the Starry Heavens,' he 
must not be blamed if he infers that the work is 
devoted to teaching a knowledge of the constella- 
tions. But this book of Professor Edward Irving 
is of quite a different nature. Dedicated to 'All 
true citizens of the Great Cosmos and to all who 
wish to become such,' it aims to interest the gen- 
eral reader in astronomical processes, and in 
those results of astronomical research that most 
compel the imagination and are associated with 
the widest — and in some respects the wildest — 
of theorizings. The author's 'chariot of imagina- 
tion' carries the reader through the starry 
realms, leads him to see in an humble rock-frag- 
ment something similar to the entire known uni- 
verse, and in turn to consider the latter as per- 
chance forming a fragment of some yet grander 
structure. The latest speculations about the 
Nebular Hypothesis are here exploited in con- 
siderable detail, the discussion of the structure of 
matter embracing an admirably clear and suc- 
cinct account of various forms of radio-activity. 
Line cuts and photo-engravings abound, but are 
scarcely more picturesque than the language of 
the author, which is usually interesting and genu- 
inely informing. There are occasional lapses 
which offend the serious reader, when the author 
attempts undue jocoseness, or oversteps the 
boundaries of good taste in references to the 
Bible. His philosophical standpoint may be judged 
by a quotation from page 205: 'We have come to 
the conclusion that nothing exists apart from 
matter and its energies. Mind, in the form of 
desires and inclinations, exists not only through- 
out the animal and vegetable kingdoms, but like- 
wise in so-called dead matter. Even the mole- 
cules, atoms, and corpuscles have a kind of sensa- 
tion and will.* On the whole, the book may be 
characterized as a fresh, up-to-date, and stimulat- 
ing series of short essays on the worlds that peo- 
ple space. (F. A. Stokes Co.)

McKinley is connected with the inauguration of 
the Buffalo Exposition. The chief objection to 
the book is, however, the prejudice of the author. 
Not only does he start out with the assumption 
that William II. is un malade, but every page con- 
tradicts the translator's statement that his author 
is 'polite, gracious and free from malice' in his 
presentation of facts and in his conclusions. No 
better evidence of this, or indeed of the whole 
tone of the book, can be offered than a few sen- 
tences from the final summing up. 

' William II. will leave Germany unstable, divided, 
poverty-stricken, nerveless and feeble. As soon as he 
shall have disappeared, the fatality of his work of self- 
advertising and noise will be revealed. . . . One looks 
in vain in his words, examines their humour, their 
substance, their intelligence, their utility, their precision, 
their good sense, and their intent. Only occasionally do 
we find gleams of almost human intelligence amid the 
platitudinous commonplaceness of his incoherent declama- 
tions. This man is always on the surface of everything. 
His brain is a void, and sadder yet, his heart is a 
Sahara. Honour does not blossom there and there pity 
dies.' 

But enough! If the work contains any grains 
of truth they are hid in an even larger measure of 
chaff, and are as little worth the search as Shake- 
speare regarded the reasons of Gratiano. 



Breaking 
the Western 
wilderness. 



The latest of the instructive vol- 
imies prepared by Mr. Frederick S. 
Dellenbaugh out of the memoirs 
and anecdotes of our western frontier bears the 
comprehensive title, 'Breaking the Wilderness: 
The Story of the Conquest of the Far West, from 
the Wanderings of Cabeza de Vaca to the First 
Descent of the Colorado by Powell, and the Com- 
pletion of the Union Pacific Railway, with Par- 
ticular Account of the Exploits of Trappers and 
Traders' (Putnam). It affords curious verification 
of the economic interpretation of history, as 
insisted upon by Marx and Engels, in assigning 
to the beaver and the quest for his valuable pelt 
the first of the motives that led to the exploration 
of the western country to the northward, just as 
the Spanish search for gold led to the entry of 
the white man upon the wilderness to the south. 
Mr. Dellenbaugh 's attitude toward the whites in 
their relations to the Indian — called Amerind 
throughout the work — is all that rightminded- 
ness and honest judgment demand. To have 
cheated and imposed upon the red man, often- 
times in the merest wantonness, to have made 
him drunken for the sake of cheating him the 
more readily, to have denied him ordinary 
humanity, and then to have cast all the odium 
for his acts upon his evil and savage nature, is 
to Mr. Dellenbaugh one of the arch-hypocrisies

of the Auglo-Saxon, and he does not scruple to 
say so. The greatest interest of the book will 
probably be found to lie in the innumerable and 
fully authenticated tales of trappers and traders 
>vith which its pages abound; while the illus- 
trations, generally from photographs, are truly 
illustrative. 

The popular interest that has been 
thTancients. awakened of late years in the furni- 
ture of the past by a number of 
sumptuous volumes upon the subject, is not likely 
to be gratified by the work just issued under the 
title, 'Studies in Ancient Furniture' (University 
of Chicago Press), by Miss Caroline L. Ransom; 
for the subtitle, 'Couches and Beds of the 
Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans,' limits the sub- 
ject-matter both as to the kind of furniture dealt 
with and as to the ancient peoples among whom 
the observations recorded have been made. From 
all that we can learn of the beds and couches of 
the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, they were 
neither beautiful to look at nor comfortable to lie 
upon. ^liss Ransom's book is not intended for 
popular reading. It is a slightly expanded col- 
lege thesis, and a scholarly contribution to the 
archaeologj- of furniture. No phase of the subject 
is overlooked, and the studies include valuable 
chapters upon materials, technique, ornament, 
furnishings, forms, and styles of the beds of the 
different periods, which seem to be exhaustive as 
to the literary and monumental sources of our 
information. The results are presented in a man- 
ner which, though not entertaining to the general 
reader, will prove highly iustrucdve to the stu- 
dent of archaeology. The book is amply illus- 
trated, and well provided with marginsd titles, 
tables, notes, a discussion of the plates, indexes, 
and other supplementary aids to the student in 
pursuit of knowledge regarding ancient dormitory 
furniture. 

The beginnings 'The Conquest of the Southwest, 
of expansion the Story of a Great Spoliation' 
by spoliation. (Appleton) is Mr. CjiTis Townsend 
Brady's contribution to the 'Expansion of the 
Republic' series; and an interesting book he has 
made of it. It deals with the status of the mag- 
nificent sweep of territorj- comprised in the 
Southwestern States and Territories, and in Cali- 
fornia, before the secession of Texas, with the 
settlement by Americans of that territorv', their 
conflicts with the Mexican authorities, their war 
of independence, with annexation, and with the 
war with Mexico and the subsequent Gadsden 
Purchase. It is written simply and effectively, 
and with less elaboration of detail than previous 
works from the same hand. The restraint shown 
in describing the victories of the Americans over 
the Mexicans, for example, adds greatly to the 
effectiveness of the volume: and Mr. Brady's atti- 
tude toward the ethical questions involved in the 
conquest is well indicated by the use of the word 
'spoliation' in his sub-title. A word might have 
been said about the evil precedent then estab- 
lished for policies still at work in the Philip- 
pines; but no doubt is left in the mind of the 
reader that the American nation was an^iiltv of 



a crime against Mexico, made worse rather than 
better by the fact that its chief perpetrators 
seemed to be unaware of their giiilt. 



With the Mr. Frederic Villiers, journalist and 

Japanese at artist, has reprinted in an octavo 
Port Arthur. volume his letters to one of the 
London newspapers, imder the title, ' Port Arthur : 
Three Months with the Besiegers; A Diurnal of 
Occurents' (Longmans). The book contains thir- 
ty-five illustrations, about equally divided 
between the author's sketches on the spot and 
instantaneous photographs, with a map for the 
better understanding of the narrative. The text 
is brightly written, in a vein altogether cheerful, 
in spite of serious discomforts borne with diffi- 
cultj'. Mr. Villiers has nothing but praise for 
Japan, its generals and soldiery, its inventiveness, 
resourcefulness, and politeness; and Americans, 
as deeply in sympathy with Japan as the British, 
will not find the praise fulsome or misplaced. 
Some share of the story is given up to other 
correspondents, by way of affoi'ding a backsrround 
for the accounts of excursions and alanims which 
make up its bulk, and the resvdt is an intimate 
little picture of the life of newspajjer men at 
the front. The volume will add, though not 
greatly, to our knowledge of a war that prom- 
ises to mark a new epoch in the world's history. 



Arbitration '^^^ Hon. John W. Foster has pre- 
and the jjared a compend on 'Arbitration 
Hague Court. 3^^ ^he Ha^e Court' (Houghton), 
in response to a resolution of the Mohonk Arbi- 
tration Conference, of which he is president. 
The result is a slender volume, printed in 
large tj'pe, in which the facts leading up to the 
establishment of the Hague tribunal are set 
forth in broad lines, and with it all that has been 
accomplished since its institution in the way of 
practical arbitrament. An appendix contains the 
statutes ordained by the Hague Conference of 
1S99, the resolutions of the Interpai'liamentary 
Union at St, Louis, specimen treaties effected 
under the influence of the movement, and several 
other matters. To those unfamiliar with the 
entirely practical aspect assumed by this board 
for the settlement of international differences, 
this crystalization of the spirit of Christianity in 
international law, the book will be a revelation. 
It should have an educational effect of the highest 
value on the attitude of the American people 
toward a principle they have done so much to 
cherish, and should react upon the Senate of the 
nation. 

A minor The unsuccessful attempt of Gen- 

episode of eral Anthony Wayne, in 1780, to 

the Revolution, dislodge a band of Loyalists en- 
gaged in cutting fire-wood on the height at Bulls 
Feny. opposite New York City, was one of the 
minor events of the Revolutionary War. Diverted 
from his true purpose of dislodging the wood- 
cutters from the small block-house in which they 
had taken refuge, Wayne had to content himself 
with collecting the cattle, sheep, and hogs, found 
on the way, with which to feed the army. This

aspect of the foraj^ led Major Andre to write the 
famous poem on 'The Cow Chace,' ending,— 

' And now I've closed my epic strain ; 

I tremble as I show it. 
Lest this same warrior-drover Wayne 

Should ever catch the poet.' 

An exhaustive essay on the expedition, written 
by the late Clarke H. Winfield, is presented to 
the public (New York: William Abbatt), with of- 
ficial dispatches and some valuable photographic 
reproductions of original material. It deserves a 
place in every collection of Americana, and espe- 
cially those relating to the American Revolution. 



IS^OTES. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A volume of 'Dramatic Episodes,' by Miss 
Marjorie Benton Cooke, is sent us by the Dramatic 
Publishing Co., Chicago. The success of Miss 
Cooke's previous volume, 'Modern Monologues,' has 
been such as to justify the preparation of the 
present work, which contains ten pieces, each in 
a single scene, dealing mostly with the fashions or 
the humors of present-day life. 

The 'Official Report of the Thirteenth Universal 
Peace Congress,' held in Boston last October, has 
just been published by the Committee intrusted 
with that function, and makes a volume of three 
hundred and fifty pages. It contains the full pro- 
ceedings of the various sessions, besides lists of 
members and delegates. It is a work of deep inter- 
est to all having at heart the cause of civilization. 

Professor Albert S. Cook, as editor of the 'Yale 
Studies in English,' seems to have formed a definite 
plan to produce a new edition of Ben Jonson's 
plays, in the guise of a series of doctoral disserta- 
tions by his advanced students. 'The Alchemist' 
and 'Bartholomew Fair' have already been given 
us in this form, and two more volumes are now at 
hand. Dr. De Winter has edited ' The Staple of 
News,' and Dr. Herbert S. Mallory 'The Poetaster' 
for this series. Each monograph is a volume of 
nearly three hundred pages, presenting a critical 
text, with the accompaniment of elaborate notes, a 
glossary, and an introduction. The plan thus not- 
ably inaugurated by Professor Cook may well be 
recommended to other instructors in other universi- 
ties. It seems to offer a solution of the problem of 
making the doctoral thesis a work of more than 
merely academic interest and usefulness. 

The 'Belles-Lettres Series' of Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co., which we described at the time of its incep- 
tion, is now making substantial progress. Two 
volumes in the dramatic section were published a 
year ago, and to this section there are now added 
volumes of Webster and Browning. The former 
includes 'The White Devil' and 'The Duchess of 
Malfy,' edited by Prof. Martin W. Sampson, while 
the latter gives us 'A Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' 
'Colombe's Birthday,' 'A Soul's Tragedy,' and 'In 
a Balcony,' edited by Prof. Arlo Bates. Mr. 
Andrew J. Georj;e's edition of Coleridge (published 
in 1902) has been fitted into the section of the 
series devoted to nineteenth-century poets. Finally, 
for the Old English section. Prof. James W. Bright 
has edited, in two volumes, the Gospels of Matthew 
and John, from the West-Saxon manuscripts. All 
these books have introductions, notes, bibliographies, 
and carefully-collated texts, and give us great con- 
fidence in the ultimate value of this important edu- 
cational series. 



The very interesting anonymous 'Confessions of 
a Publisher,' which have been appearing recently in 
the Boston 'Transcript,' will be published in book 
form this month by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

'The Etiquette of Correspondence,' published by 
the A. Wessels Co., and prepared by Miss Helen E. 
Gavit, has just been issued in a second edition, 
revised and enlarged. 

'Mechanism,' by Professor S. Dunkerley, is a com- 
prehensive text-book on the kinematics of machines, 
prepared for technical colleges, and published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

The John Crerar Library, Chicago, has just pub- 
lished * A List of Cyclopedias and Dictionaries, with 
a List of Directories,' now contained in that collec- 
tion. The work extends to nearly three hundred 
pages. 

The G. W. Dillingham Co. republish Dr. Craven's 
'Prison Life of Jefferson Davis,' a work of consid- 
erable historical interest, for which the demand has 
recently been renewed by the revival of an old con- 
troversy. 

'The Drink Problem in Modern Life,' by Bishop 
Henry C. Potter, and 'The Personality of God,' by 
the Rev. Lyman Abbott, are two additions to the 
' What Is Worth While ' series of Messrs. Thomas Y. 
Crowell & Co. 

'The First Principles of Pianoforte Playing,' by 
Professor Tobias Matthay, is an extract from the 
author's 'The Act of Touch,' with two extra chap- 
ters, now published in a separate volume for the 
use of schools by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

Simultaneously with the publication of Mr. and 
Mrs. Williamson's 'The Princess Passes,' Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. issue a new uniform edition of the 
earlier book by the same authors, the popular 
'Lightning Conductor,' illustrated from photographs 
of the scenes described in the story. 

'Dodge's Advanced Geography,' by Professor 
Richard Elwood Dodge, is published by Messrs. 
Band, McNally & Co. It is a work of over three 
hundred pages, not unwieldy in form, and consists 
of two parts, 'The Principles of Geography' and 
'Comparative Geography of the Continents.' 

'The Historical Development of the Poor Law of 
Connecticut,' by Dr. Edward Warren Capen, is one 
of the Columbia 'Studies in History, Economics, 
and Public Law.' It is a pamphlet of portentous 
thickness (over five hundred pages), and is pub- 
lished for the University by the Macmillan Co. 

Those who are afflicted with the mania of ances- 
tor-hunting will welcome a little book by Mr. Frank 
AUaben, called 'Concerning Genealogies,' and 
published at the Grafton Press. It is a volume of 
practical suggestions, pleasantly worded, and 
embodies the results of much experience in the 
work. 

Parts 2, 3, and 4 of the Classified Catalogue of 
the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh have for their 
respective subjects Philosophy and Religion, Soci- 
ology and Philology, and Natural Science and Use- 
ful Arts. Each is a fairly thick volume, made valua- 
ble for reference by classification, annotation, and 
an index. 

Four volumes recently added to Macmillan 's 
'Pocket English Classics' series include abridg- 
ments of the translation of Homer's Odyssey by 
Messrs. Butcher and Lang, and of the Hiad by 
Messrs. Lang, Leaf, and Myers; a condensed reprint 
of 'Alice in Wonderland,' with Tenniel's drawings;

and Hawthorne's 'Wonder Book.' This little series, 
carefully edited, well printed, and inexpensive in 
price, should find a much wider field than the class- 
room for which it is particularly designed. 

Mr. J. P. Dunn, Jr. 's volume on Indiana, in the 
* American Commonwealths ' series, has been reissued 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in a new and 
enlarged edition, bringing the history down to date. 
The original text has undergone few changes, hav- 
ing borne the charge of criticism without suffering 
any very serious damage. 

' Early Dutch and English Voyages to Spitzbergen 
in the Seventeenth Century, ' edited by Sir W. Mar- 
tin Conway, is Volume XI. of the second series of 
the publications of the Hakluyt Society. It in- 
cludes the narrations of Gerritsz and Segersz, now 
first translated into English, as well as other lesser 
but pertinent documents. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a 'Syllabus of Cos- 
tinental European History from the FaU of Home 
to 1870,' prepared by Prof. Oliver Huntington 
Bichardson, in collaboration with Messrs, Guy 
Stanton Ford and Edward Lewis Durfee. Seventy- 
eight lectures are outlined, and the alternate leaves 
of the book are left blank for notes. 

The Jewish Publication Society of America have 
issued a small volume of ' Legends and Tales in 
Prose and Verse, ' compiled by Miss Isabel E. Cohen. 
The sources of this material range aU the way from 
Apocrypha and Talmud to the writings of modern 
English and American poets, forming a variety of 
pleasant and instructive reading for the young. 

*Les Classiques Francais' is a new series of 
charming little books with the Dent imprint, pub- 
lished in this country by the Messrs. Putnam. The 
first two volumes issued are 'Contes Choisis' by 
Balzac, prefaced by M. Bourget, and a volume 
containing Chateaubriand's 'Atala, ' 'Ben6, ' and *Le 
Dernier Abenc6rage,' prefaced by the Vicomte de 
Vogufi. 

Professor A. S. Cook, of Yale, has edited for the 
Oxford University Press 'The Dream of the Bood,' 
an Old English Poem attributed to Cynewulf, and 
the little book will be ready shortly. The MS. was 
discovered in 1822 in the Chapter Library of the 
Cathedral of Vercelli, where it still remains. Pro- 
fessor Cook discusses and dismisses the theory of 
Caedmon's authorship. 

Under the title of 'The Life and Nature Series' 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. have in preparation an 
attractive library of supplementary school reading, 
selected, edited, and arranged by Mr. Charles 
"Welsh. The first two volumes, to be published this 
spring, will include 'The Bee People' by Miss Mar- 
garet W. Morley. and 'Lady Lee and Oither Animal 
Stories ' by Hermon Lee Ensign. 

The following books, hitherto published else- 
where, have been added to the list of Messrs. Fox, 
Duffield &: Co.: 'The Case of Bussia,' a composite 
view by Alfred Bambaud, Vladimir Simkovitch, J. 
Novicoff, Peter Boberts, and Isaac Hourwich; 
'Zionism.' by Max Xordau; 'The Little Kingdom 
of Home.' by Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster; and 'Ten 
Girls from Dickens,' by Kate Dickinson Sweetser. 

A volume of 'Specimens of the Elizabethan 
Drama from Lyly to Shirley' (1580-1642) is about 
to be issued from the Oxford University Press. 
Nearly a hundred typical and representative scenes, 
complete in themselves, have been selected by Mr. 
"W. H. Williams, now Professor of EngHsh Litera- 
ture in the University of Tasmania, A short appre- 
ciation is prefixed to each section, notes being 
added. 



The Messrs. Seribner are the American importers 
of the new edition (the fifth) of 'A History of 
Architecture on the Comparative Method,' by Ban- 
ister Fletcher. The revision is by Mr. Banister F. 
Fletcher, the son of the authorJ This handsome 
volume of seven hundred pages and two thousand 
illustrations is a veritable encyclopsedia of its sub- 
ject, and presents in compact form an immense 
amount of information. 

To the 'Oxford Modern French Series' of texts, 
published by the Oxford Clarendon Press, have just 
been added: 'Les Normands en Angleterre et en 
France,' extracted from Thierry, and edited by Mr. 
A. H. Smith; also Jules David's 'Le Serment,' 
edited by Miss C6cile Hugon, Mr. W. B. Jenkins 
sends us texts of 'L'Abbe Daniel,' by Andr6 Theu- 
riet, edited by Mr. C. Fontaine, and Scribe's 'Le 
Verre d'Eau,' edited by Professor F. G. G. Schmidt. 
From Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we have Theodor 
Storm 's ' Geschichten aus der Tonne, ' edited by Pro- 
fessor Frank Vogel. and 'The Story of Cupid and 
Psyche, ' arranged by Miss H. A. Guerber for 
translation into French.

RECENT SUCCESSFUL McCLURG BOOKS 



As this issue of the THE DIAL is somewhat of a celebration number it 
seems proper to take advantage of the occasion to call attention to some 
of the more distinguished successes on our list during the past few years. 

THE JOURNALS OF LEWIS AND CLARK 

'TpHIS two-volume reprint (now in its second edition) was the first issue in the series of Library Reprints of Ameri- 
-^ cana. The publishers' aim was to make the "Journals" available in handy, inexpensive, accurate form, without 
a mass of notes to obscure the thread of the narrative. Recently the Baltimore Sun said, " The making of these vol- 
umes is of high character in paper, printing, and binding, the work leaves nothing to be desired , and the manner of their 
editing calls forth large praise." Dr. James K. Hosmer furnishes an admirable introduction, and the books are pro- 
vided with photogravure reproductions of the best portraits now extant. 

Library Edition $5.00 net ; Limited Large-paper Edition $15.00 net. 

OTHER AMERICANA REPRINTS 
'TpHE other reprints in the series, since published, are Hennepin's " A New Discovery " (2 vols., $6. 00 net) and 
-*• Lahontan's " New Voyages" (2 vols., $7.50 net), both edited by Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, and " Gass's Jour- 
nal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition," edited by Dr. Hosmer (i vol., $3.50 net). 

The limited large-paper edition of " Gass's Journal " is $9.00 net, and those of the " Hennepin " and " LahontaD " 

are $18.00 net, each. 

''THE CONQUEST'' 

17*VEN now, after two years and many additions to the literature of the subject, the greatest amount of exact informa- 
■^^ tion, in a readable form, concerning Lewis and Clark will be found in Mrs. Dye's famous story. Certainly in no 
other one volume is there so vivid a picture of the Indian wars preceding the Louisiana Purchase, the crossing of the 
two great pioneers, and the events following the settlement of Oregon. "The Conquest" has frequently been 
described as the great American epic. With colored frontispiece. $1.50. 

'' THE SOULS OF BLACK FOLK'' 

TT is safe to say that no recent book dealing with the race question has attracted more attention than this extraordinary 
■*• volume by Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois. His fiery eloquence and unquestioned sincerity presented a combination which 
could not help creating a profound impression. It is one of the great books of the 20th century. $1.20 net. 

A HANDBOOK OF MODERN JAPAN 

I3UBLISHED in the Fall of 1903, Mr. Clement's remarkable volume has successfully sustained competition with 
innumerable other books that have followed the awakening of interest in the Far East. A new revised (fifth) edi- 



r 

tion is in preparation, for which the author is writing an additional chapter on the war, and many new portraits of 
the leading figures in the great drama have been added. In this completed form the " Handbook" will justify its 
title more than ever. With many illustrations. $1.40 net. 

''THE ILLINI" 

'TpO put into a book — half fiction, half history — the giant figures of Illinois' heroic sons so that they are made real 
and life-like to the present generation, is an achievement of the highest order. And certainly Clark E. Carr, the 
intimate associate of Lincoln, Grant, Logan, and Douglas was the man most endowed for such a task. His book has 
made a permanent place for itself in a few months, and three editions have been printed — a remarkable record for a 
book of this class. $2.00 net. 

BIRDS OF CALIFORNIA 

TV /TRS. WHEELOCK has established her position among leading ornithologists by her exceptionally painstaking 
and accurate work in this ambitious book. The volume is now recognized as the authority on the birds 
of this locality, and the sound usefulness of the text is supplemented by the eighty-eight beautiful drawings by Bruce 
Horsfall, the leading delineator of bird-life. The production of a reference work destined to become standard is 
a matter of pride with any publisher, $2.50 net.

RECENT SUCCESSFUL McCLURG BOOKS 



THEODORE THOMAS A MUSICAL BIOGRAPHY 

JUST as Mr. Thomas himself was the foremost figure in the development of music in America, this book of his life 
must be regarded as the most important contribution to the history of that development. Fortunately all his personal 
share in the two volumes was finished some time before his death, so that the work is in every way complete. In the 
able hands of Mr. George P. Upton the labor of collecting and editing the immense amount of diverse material has been 
most satisfactorily performed, and the books represent a fitting tribute to the great leader. 

In two volumes (the second almost entirely of programs) with portraits and views, $6.00 net ; Large-paper edition, 

limited, $25 .c» net. 

AN INDEX TO POETRY AND RECITATIONS 

'TpHE distinction belonging to this monumental reference-book is that which always goes to any achievement that has 

■*■ successfully supplied an urgent want of long standing. As over ten thousand selections have been indexed by 

titles, authors, and first lines, it is easy to see what a boon the book is to librarians, booksellers, and teachers. tS-oo <*''• 

MR. CODTS ''WORLD'S BEST'' SERIES 

"\ /f R. Sherwin Cody has been unusually successful in discovering an undeveloped field, and giving to a great many 
■*■-■• people just what they had been unable to find before. His " World's Greatest Short Stories " has been adopted 
in scores of educational institutions, also his "Best English Essays" and "Great Orations." He has an unusual 
faculty for discriminating selections, and the ability to supply introductions and notes that make a wide popular appeal. 
A new volume of the " Great English Poets " will be published in May. Each $1.00 net. 

FICTION IN BEAUTIFUL FORM 

T II /"ITH the publication of " The Thrall of Leif the Lucky" in 1902 a new idea was inaugurated — the presenta- 
' ' tion of the ordinary $1.50 novel with a degree of illustration and ornamentation never before attempted. In 
this book, which brought forward Miss Ottilie Liljencrantz as a romancer of unusual gifts, appeared the first colored 
pictures by the Kinneys, two young artists who have since demonstrated their unequaled ability in the handling of 
mediaeval subjects. "Leif the Lucky," with its illustrations in full color (the first ever used in fiction) and its 
characteristic decorations and type, created a sensation. A year later came another Viking romance from the same 
author and illustrators, "The Ward of King Canute," which proved equally successful, as it was distinguished 
by the same original features. 

MR. RANDALL PARRISH 

TN the introduction of new authors we have been notably successful. After Miss Liljencrantz's books came a 
■*■ romance of early Chicago by another hitherto unknown writer — "When Wilderness Was King." With the 
benefit of the embellishments by the Kinneys it secured immediate attention, which augmented rapidly when the charm 
of the story itself became known. It was a popular success of the first rank, figuring in the " six best sellers" and 
other evidences of prosperity. Mr. Parrish's second novel, "My Lady of the North," has been even more popular, 
and at the present time over sixty thousand volumes of these two stories have been sold — the work of a writer 
absolutely unknown about a year ago. 

''FOR THE WHITE CHRIST'' 

TN this romance of Charlemagne's day (just published) the publishers felt that a suitable story far exceeding all 
■'■ previous efforts in book making was at hand. The author, Robert Ames Bennet, had gone thoroughly into 
his subject and produced one of the "big" novels of early Christianity of the class represented by "Ben Hur " 
and " Quo Vadis." It is a splendid tale of heroic scope and in external adornment surpasses any volume previously 
offered. The illustrations are in full color, several new ideas in decoration have been utilized, and within six weeks 
of publication day there is a universal verdict pronouncing "For the White Christ" "the most beautiful book 
of fiction ever published." 

These and other books of our publication are for sale wherever books 
are sold. A beautifully illustrated catalogue will be sent to any address

THE OPENING OF TIBET 

By PERCEVAL LANDON 

(With Introduction by Colonel Youngliusband) 

THE NEW YORK GLOBE says: 

" * The Opening of Tibet' should take place with such books as Stanley's * In Darkest Africa' and Nansen's 
♦ Farthest North ' — books which, while of the greatest historical importance, yet, because so filled with the romance 
and mystery and thrill of the unknown, fire the popular imagination and are of the liveliest general interest. . . . 
All the exuberance of adjectival praise usually reserved for the latest novel alone might with great appropriateness be 
applied to Mr. Landon's volume, which is of absorbing interest from the first page to the last." 

Colonel Sir Francis Younghusband, the leader of this expedition to Lhasa (the mysterious city 
of Tibet) commends Perceval Landon, Special Correspondent of the London Times^ as the best 
man to chronicle this journey of discovery. In his introduction to the book he endorses this state- 
ment. His opinions as to the author are echoed by all the leading newspapers and periodicals ; 

CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD: 

" Should the British expedition to Lhasa leave no other good results than Perceval Landon's large volume, * The 
Opemng of Tibet' it would still be justified." 

THE SPECTATOR: 

" The unveiling of the last of the hidden civilization of the world has found a worthy chronicler. The Tibetan 
expedition was fortunate to have with it a writer so competent to do justice to its romance, so sympathetic and reten- 
tive of impressions, and, above all, the possessor of a style so dexterous and graceful." 

The volume is superbly illustrated from photographs by the author^ and while it is well worth 
two guineas (the selling price in England), the American edition is published at ^^3.80 net. (Postage, 
38 cents extra.)

To most musical people Alessandro Scarlatti is little more than 

a name, and even musical historians have been singularly cautious 

in their references to him. He is, however, a very important figure 

in the history of music, on account of his influence on the formation 

of the classical style — i.e., the style of Handel, Bach, Haydn, 

Mozart, and Beethoven. The book is copiously illustrated with 

musical examples, and includes a complete catalogue of Scarlatti's

The importance of this work is twofold. In the first place, it 

sums up the teaching of one who has been for many years a leader 

in biological progress. As Professor Weismann has from time to 

time during the last quarter of a century frankly altered some of 

his positions, this deliberate summing up of his mature conclusions 

is very valuable. In the second place, as the volumes discuss all 

the chief problems of organic evolution, they form a trustworthy 

guide to the whole subject, and may be regarded as furnishing — 

what is much needed — a Text-book of Evolution Theory. The 

translation has been revised by the author.

CHAUCER. — Facsimile Reproduction of the First Folio of Chaucer, 1532. Edited, 
with Introduction, by the Rev. Professor SKEAT, Litt.D., etc. 

A Collotype Facsimile of the collected edition of Chaucer's Works (together with many Chaucerian pieces), edited by W. Thtkbi and 
printed in the year 1532, is about to be issued. 

As in the case of Shakespeare, there are four Folio editions of Chaucer. Of these four, Thtvss's edition of 1532 is the only one of real 
value, as all the rest are derived from it. It is of special value as an original authority. There is no other known source of ETsk's 
Teitameni of Love, or for tbe Ballads entitled The Flower Curtetye, To my Sovereign Lady, or A Goodly Ballad. Of the Tetia- 
meni 0/ Cretteid the only other authority is the later (but independent) edition of 1593. Of Sower's Praise of Peace and the 
Romaunt 0/ the Rote, there is no other authority except one MS. In the case of the Bomaont, Thynne's text is better than that 
of the BIS., and supplies many missing lines, inclusive of lines 1-44. Thynne is also an authority for the Ballad of Good Counsel, 
the Envoy to Bukton, and the Assembly of Ladies, of which there are two other copies ; and for the Bnvoy to Seegan, and the Book 
of the Duchess, of which there are three MSS. For lines 31-96 of the last mentioned, which are missing in two of the MSS., Thynne 
is the best authority. In other cases, the text of Thynne is also, in general, well worth consulting ; notably, in the case of TroUus 
and Cressida. And it is well to bear in mind that from 1532 to 1597, the text of the Canterbury Tales was most easily accesrible 
to readers in one of the four Folios. 

Tbe copy to be used as the original for this reproducti<m is that in tbe British Mnaenm Library. It ia taUer aad in better condition than 
tbe Bodleian copy, and is complete. 

The edition will be limited to 1,000 copies, of which the greater number have now been sobecribed for. Tbe price will be SSO.OO net,

what one irrepressible young woman accomplished in a neighborhood almost as unpromising as the celebrated 
"Cabbage Patch." "The story abounds in humor, with a hint of tears, and an overflowing kindness of 
heart bubbling over in infectious gayety." — Boston Herald.

THE BUILDING OF 
A TRUST 



THE BIOGRAPHY OF 
A TRUST BUILDER 



IDA M. TARBELUS 

History of the Standard Oil Company 

The two great questions to-day before the American people are: 

1. The methods by which monopoly has come to control production. 

2. The methods employed by Mr. Rockefeller personally in building up the greatest of all American 
monopolies, the Standard Oil Company. 

In answer to these questions the American people are demanding, not the vague talk and charges that 
are filling the air and papers, hut facts. It is /acts that Miss Tarbell gives them in her history of the Standard 
Oil. She alone shows the real bearing upon monopoly of the railroad rebate, of the control of raw material, 
of spying on competition, of underselling to drive a rival from the market; she alone dissects in every detail 
the practical working of a typical Trust, and tells the truth, the nvhole truth, and nothing but the truth about 
Mr. Rockefeller. 

Says the NEW YORK INDEPENDENT: 

" Miss Tarbell's service, and it is a great one, is making clear to the casual reader as well as to the student the menacing 
greatness of that problem, its ever growing importance, and in furnishing facts necessary for its comprehension, and, let us 
hope, its ultimate solution."

The Romance of 

Victor Hugfo and Juliette Drouet 

By HENRY WELLINGTON WACK, author of "The Congo Free State." 
With an Introduction by Francois Coppee. 12mo, Fully Illustrated, net, $1.50. 

As is well known to students of Victor Hugo, his relations with Mme. Juliette Drouet, extending over fifty years, 
formed the romance of the poet's life. Hugo's letters to Juliette were published in France some time ago, but her 
love letters in reply, or perhaps the letters which inspired Victor Hugo's correspondence, are now for the first time 
made public. They throw an interesting light on one of the most remarkable attachments in literary history. 

Mr. Wack has written a most readable book around the letters, giving a sketch of Hugo's life during his exile 
in Guernsey, with many anecdotes and extracts from his correspondence illustrative of his personality. 

The Works and Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb 

Edited by E. V. LUCAS 
7 vols. Very Fully Illustrated. Each, net, $2.25. 
I. Miscellaneous Prose. 1798-1834. IV. Dramatic Specimens. 

II. The Essays of Elia V. Poems and Plays. 

and The Last Essays of Elia. VI. and VII. The Letters. 

III. Books for Children. (Completing the Work.) 

No edition of Lamb at all approaches this in completeness. Every word of the text has been collated with the 
best editions, a very large mass of new matter has been discovered and incorporated, and Mr. Lucas in his notes has 
endeavored not only to relate Lamb's writings to his life, but to account for all his quotations and allusions — an ideal 
of thoroughness far superior to any that previous editors have set before themselves. 

" We congratulate Mr. Lucas on this crown to his enduring work, and equally congratulate all lovers of Lamb on 
the possession of the seven volumes, which form, if not the ideal edition of Lamb, at least the best which is likely to 
be produced for very many years — it may well be forever." — The Spectator.

a song in prose. No preacher can afford to be without this book, nor can any devout layman. 
It is a fire to warm one's heart at, and a light to help one's eyes. It is full of the stuff strong

The Progress of Hellenism in Alexander's Empire 

By John P. Mahaffy, Sometime Professor of Ancient History in the University of Dublin. 
Professor Mahaffy has in this book epitomized the results of his studies, extending over more than twenty years and 
covering all the known records of Greek influence in Alexander's empire. The book is thus a compendium of rare 
value : to the student it presents an accurate summary of a most brilliant culture-epoch ; to the casual reader it offers 
an outline for more extended reading. $1.00 net; prepaid, $1.10. 



The Messianic Hope in 
the New Testament 

By Shaileb Mathews, 

Professor of New Testament History in 

the University of Chicago. 
New Testament study along histor- 
ical lines and embodying the latest 
results of critical work in popular 
form is extremely rare in America. 
This book is an example of such 
study. It subjects the narrative to 
a searching criticism and seeks to 
determine which of the concepts 
common to the writers are of local 
application and contemporary, and 
wluch are applicable under all 
circumstances of time and place. 
The messianic hope forms the main 
theme of the discussion.

Studies in 
General Physiology 

(In two Tolumes) 

By Jacques Loeb, 
Head of the Department of Physiology in 

the University of California. 
Professor Loeb has long been endeav- 
oring to ascertain the laws controlling 
physical life-phenomena, and espe- 
cially those involved in reproduction. 
He has finally succeeded in artificially 
fertilizing ova, and has been able to 
develop the ova thus treated. The 
experiments have not been elsewhere 
recorded, so that these volumes possess 
a special value to physicians and other 
students of biology. For many years 
Prof. Loeb's results will form the point 
of departure in similar investigations.

Lectures on Commerce 

Edited by Henry R. Hatfield, 
Formerly Dean of the College of Com- 
merce and Administration in the 
University of Chicago. 

These lectures — sixteen in number 
— were delivered before the College 
of Commerce and Administration in 
the University of Chicago. They 
treat of railways, banking, trade, 
industry ; and inasmuch as the lec- 
turers include such men as Secretary 
Morton, Ex-Comptroller Eckels, 
Vice-President Forgan, Professor 
Laughlin, they are extremely inter- 
esting to all who wish a first-hand 
account of modem and successful 
business methods. The book is of 
exceptional value to young men.

The Place of Industries in Elementary 
Education 

By Katharine E. Dopp, 
Instructor in the University of Chicago. 
This book recognizes the relation between the J)eriods of 
growth in the child and the stages or ages of industrial 
development in the race. It is pointed out that better 
results in primary education can be attained only by 
assigning to the industries a much larger place in the 
curriculum than heretofore. A recent revision has 
enlarged the volume by some 70 pages of text and 16 full- 
page illustrations. $1.00 net; prepaid, $1.11. 



The Psychology of Child Development 

By Irving King, 
Professor of Psychology :n Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. 
This book is the first attempt to apply the functional 
point of view to child psychology, and it promises to 
transform the study from a dreary catalogue of " facts " 
for which none but a few enthusiasts care, to a really 
illuminating and scientific account of child-life. To 
those teachers who have felt the stimulus of Dr. 
Dewey's educational thought, this application of his 
method will be welcome and inspiring.

A History of Matrimonial Institutions 

By George E. Howard, Professor of Institutional History in the University of Nebraska. 
Professor Howard has ^ven in these volumes the niost complete study yet published on the history of marriage and 
divorce. The work is in three parts. In the first the author fixes the sociological basis for the discussion; the 
second treats of the development of marriage in England ; the third is devoted to marriage and divorce in the United 
States. Everyone following the widespread discussion of the marriage and divorce problem should have access to 

this work. $10.00 net; prepaid, $10.72. 



The Trend in Higher Education 

By William Rainey Harper, 
President of the University of Chicago. 
Here, within the limits of a single book. President 
Harper gives the gist of his addresses and papers upon 
the general subject of higher education. It goes without 
sa3ring that the volume is meeting a hearty welcome

By William Rainey Harper,

solution for the religious problems which confront men 
and women during the periods of late youth and early 
manhood or womanhood. The book has its message for 
all who are honestly and earnestly striving to answer 
the questions which inevitably arise in connection with 
the religious life ; it is also a faithful index of religious 
conditions in our colleges and universities.

THIS work is the most important and complete history of

scholar who is a specialist in that period of our nation's history of which his volume treats. Each writer 
has spent years of study upon his subject and has searched many records and other historical data, bring- 
ing to light new facts and evidence. The names of these scholars and the standing of the editor are an 
assurance of the authority and permanence of this work. The plan of the narrative is chronological, the 
volumes following each other in close sequence, and its scope a critical, political, biographical account of the 
events and forces which have been vital in the making of our nation.

THE DIAL'S QUARTER-CENTURY. 

Twenty-five years ago on this first day of 
May was begun the publication of The Dial. 
Turning back to its first issue, the date 1880 
has a strangely distant look; but little else 
is changed. The heading is the same; the 
original size of the paper has been adhered 
to, with an increase in the number of pages 
demanded by its growth; and its general 
physical appearance is substantially as it 
was in the beginning, modified by inevitable 
changes in methods and standards of typog- 
raphy. Its bound volumes, of uniform height 
and nearly uniform thickness, standing in 
a long row on the library shelves, express the 
consistency and stability which from the first 
the publication has sought to establish and 
maintain. 

Such details as these are not matters of 
accident, nor are tiiey without significance. 
Fluctuations in a journal's character and 
standards, a lack of fixed ideals and clearly- 
defined aims, the indecision and instability 
that lead to trying first one tack and then 
another in the hope of catching the winds of 
popular favor, are usually typified in capri- 
cious changes of external form. The Dial 
has chosen a very different course; and no 
survey of its career would be at all discern- 
ing that did not take this feature into the 
account. Its effort has been to achieve dis- 
tinction through consistency and persistency; 
to be itself, with its own standards and char- 
acter; to have its ideals, and live up to them. 
Its aims and scope, the sort of journal it 
would try to be, the work it would set itself 
to do and the manner in which it would try 
to do it, were problems that were thought out 
in advance; and the course then decided on 
was followed with as little deviation as pos- 
sible. Whatever of success and influence the 
paper has gained, and the fact that it is now 
able to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary, 
must be attributed largely to this cause. 

Obviously, those who set for themselves 
such tasks, — to work for ideal aims, to limit 
wittingly their opportimities for material 
gain, and sacrifice immediate for ultimate 
success, — must be prepared to travel a long 
and somewhat lonely road. Xo others, indeed.

THE DIAL

have any place therein. But, fortunately for 
the stimulus to higher forms of endeavor, 
there are compensations peculiar to the case. 
The task, though difficult, may not be impos- 
sible; and those who succeed in it are likely 
to find their triumph coming at last through 
the very causes that made it seem at first 
improbable or incredible. It is clear now to 
many, as it was in the beginning to but few, 
that had The Dial been less tenacious of 
its ideals, had it been willing to decline to 
lower levels and to narrower aims, its rea- 
sons for existence would have been defeated 
and its career self-annulled. Definiteness and 
singleness of purpose, a clear view of what 
was intended to be done and unwavering per- 
sistency in doing it, are factors largely to be 
credited with such success as the enterprise 
has achieved. 

The occasion is doubtless one for self-con- 
gratulation and rejoicing. Yet somehow it 
finds us not wholly in an exultant mood. 
Boasting is forbidden before one has taken 
his armor off, and he may then be too weary 
to care much for boasting. Those who have 
large issues have generally paid the price; 
and leaders of forlorn hopes, in life as on 
the battle-field, are little prone to merry- 
making over their success. They are glad 
and proud to be successful: it is for this 
that they have staked and won. But taking 
a retrospective look, they think of other 
things, — of what it all has cost; of the ex- 
penditure of time and strength, the tale of 
years that have been taken from their own 
liv^ to give life to that for which they 
strove. A quarter-century is a big portion 
of a man's working life, particularly when 
it spans the period between thirty-five and 
sixty years; and what one gets in return for 
it should be something worth the while. That 
it is well worth the while, there is no ques- 
tion in this case. But in looking back over 
the way that has been traversed, and counting 
up the cost, one thinks vividly of the toils 
and struggles, the anxieties and disappoint- 
ments, the tragedies unwitnessed and trials 
unrecorded, the menaces and perils, *gorgons 
and chimeras dire,' unseen by all but him, 
that have beset the way. He thinks, too, of 
the many who were with him on the journey 
and are now no more. 

But the occasion lends itself also to a more 
cheerful tone. The heading of our article 
itself shows that we have much to be thank- 



ful for. Those who know something of the 
problems and history of journalism know how 
rarely success is won by periodicals that are 
precluded by the very terms of their being 
from making anything like a popular appeal. 
Earely do such become established; more 
rarely still do they achieve a quarter-century 
of continuous publication. But infinitely 
rarer is it, — so rare, indeed, that instances 
are but exceptions to the contrary rule, — • 
that they remain all that time under the same 
control and guidance with which they began 
their career. The founder and editor of The 
Dial at the beginning is still its chief editor 
and director, and has been such throughout 
the quarter-century. Fortunate in this long- 
continued service, he has been fortimate also 
in the loyal cooperation of his associates, 
and in his staff of capable and often devoted 
contributors. While in the earlier years 
something like half the paper was written 
by the editor, in recent years the work has 
been done by writers scattered from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific coast, following the 
specialization of knowledge and interests that 
is so distinctive a feature of our time. In 
entire sympathy with the ideals and motives 
of the journal, all have labored zealously 
with him to uphold its standard and enhance 
its interest and value. Another cause for 
satisfaction is that the paper has never missed 
an issue, and, as has already been pointed 
out, has never changed its general character 
and aims. The chief change that has taken 
place was in the increased frequency of issue, 
from monthly to semi-monthly, about midway 
of its career; but this was a needed improve- 
ment and advance, which may be followed by 
others as occasion may require. It may not be 
amiss to point ont in this place the fact 
that at the present time The Dial is the 
only journal in America given up to the 
criticism of current literature; it is also the 
only literary periodical in the country not 
owned or controlled by a book publishing 
house or a newspaper. 

If further grounds for felicitation were 
needed than those already cited, they might be 
found in a consideration of the opportunities 
for doing good possessed by an enlightened 
and independent organ of literary criticism 
in America. On this point, however, and on 
the service that The Dial has been able to 
render to this cause, we are content to let 
others speak for us. It would be interesting

THE DIAL

if there were space, to speak of the advances 
in the book-publishing and book-reading 
worlds in the period covered by our hasty 
survey. Here, too, there is cause for satis- 
faction, since we are doubtless safe in saying 
that the demand for books of the better 
class has increased faster than the increase in 
population, denoting an advance in culture 
and civilization. Especially is this true of 
the great Middle Regions of the country, 
the regions making such tremendous strides 
in growth and influence. CJonsiderations like 
these show that it was no mistake that The 
Dial was located in the metropolis of this 
great and growing region, in which its in- 
fluence is doubtless more direct and forceful 
than if emanating from the seaboard. The 
example and inspiration of such a journal 
in a city so lately supposed to be given 
hopelessly to sordid standards and material 
aims is something also to be taken into the 
account. Dealing with literature in the 
largest sense, it is but natural that the 
literature of its own country should be its 
chief concern; but local of course it should 
not and could not be. It is but simple justice 
to the American publishers to add that by 
none are The Dial's work and influence 
more clearly comprehended than by them; 
and not least among the reasons for gratula- 
tion on this occasion should be noted their 
intelligent appreciation and encouragement. 

We began with a note from the past: we 
end with a note for the future. One quarter- 
century of The Dial is ended. It begins 
another with a surer confidence and a soberer 
wisdom; and though the old is tinged with 
sadness, the new is lit with cheerfulness and 
hope. F. F. B. 

The first issue of The Dial (May 1, 1880) was 
made up of nineteen pages of reading matter and 
five pages of advertisements. The present issue 
of May 1, 1905, contains upwards of thirty 
reading pages and some twenty-eight pages of 
advertisements. Besides an account of 'The Orig- 
inal Dial/* by Korman C. Perkins, and other mis- 
cellaneous matter, the first issue contained a review 
of Hildreth's 'History of the United States,' by 
W. F. Poole; of Brooke Herford's 'Keligion in 
England,' by David Swing; of Lindsay's 'Mind 
in the Lower Animals,' by V. B. Denslow; of 
Austin Dobson's 'Vignettes in Ehyme,' by Fran- 
cis F. Browne; of Brander Matthews 's 'The Thea- 
tres of Paris,' by J. S. Eunnion; and of Lalor's 
translation of Nohl's 'Condensed Biographies of 
Musicians,' by George P. Upton. Of the writers 
of these reviews, the Editor and Mr. Upton are the 
only ones now living, both being contributors to 
the present issue of The Dial. 



COMM UNICA TION. 

A MISSING INDIAN NARRATIVE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

May I venture to add a word or two to Mr. 
McPike's interesting letter on the subject of 
cooperation in bibliographical research, in The 
Dial for April IT 

I merely wish to cite an instance, from my 
own personal experience, of at least one direc- 
tion in which the suggested 'Miscellanea Curi- 
osa' might be made of very great service to 
students and investigators in every department 
of human knowledge. 

In looking up material bearing upon the 
Mandans, to utilize in editing that portion of 
the Journals of LaVerendrye and his sons which 
covers their Mandan tour, I came uix>n a let- 
ter, quoted by Schoolcraft in his 'Indian Tribes 
of the United States,' etc., Part in., p. 253. 
The letter is dated January 28, 1852, and is 
from D. D. Mitchell, at that time United States 
Superintendent of Indian Affairs; and the pass- 
age to which I particularly wish to refer is 
as follows: 

' The early portion of their [the Mandan] history I 
gather from the narration of Mr. Mackintosh, who it 
seems belonged to or was in some way connected with 
the French Trading Company [he probably means the 
North West Company, many of whose employees were 
French] as far back as 1772. According to his narration 
he set out from' Montreal in the summer of 1773, crossed 
over the country to the Missouri river, and arrived at 
one of the Mandan villages on Christmas Day. He gives 
a long and somewhat romantic description of the manner 
in which he was received and dwells at some length upon 
the greatness of the Mandan population,' etc., etc. 

It seems clear from the above that Mr. 
Mitchell is not merely giving the substance of a 
conversation with the Mr. Mackintosh referred 
to, but that he refers to a written narrative, 
either in print or in manuscript. 

I have searched high and low for this Mack- 
intosh document, in the Canadian Archives at 
Ottawa, the Parliamentary Library at the same 
place, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian 
Institution, and every other depositary that 
would be likely to contain such a narrative, 
and have enquired of men like Dr. Thwaites 
of Madison, Dr. Bryce of Winnipeg, and Ben- 
jamin Suite of Ottawa, who are recognized as 
authorities on early western exploration and 
the western tribes, but so far as I can learn 
the Mackintosh document is not in any public 
library, nor does it seem to be known to those 
who would be most likely to have seen it. 

Here, it seems to me, is a case in point for 
the proposed 'Miscellanea Curiosa.' Someone, 
somewhere, must surely know something about 
Mackintosh and his elusive narrative. 

While I cite this merely as an example of the 
probable usefulness of the periodical suggested 
by Mr. McPike, I may add that I shall be 
exceedingly grateful for any information that 
can be afforded me by readers of The Dial as 
to the Mackintosh narrative.

A FAMOUS Cornish Character.* 



Eobert Stephen Hawker, for forty years 
vicar of Morwenstow in Cornwall, was emphat- 
ically a ^character.' Mr, Baring-Gould's 
account of him has made Hawker a familiar 
figure to many readers, all the more so that in 
this lively biography the romancer often gets 
the better of the historian. Even in his third 
and revised edition the author (or perhaps his 
publisher) could not find it in his heart to 
suppress some of the good stories that had been 
proved to be untrue; they were too character- 
istic to be spared. Mr. Byles says of this work, 
'As a character-sketch and a jest-book, it is 
clever and amusing, but as a biography it is 
not altogether satisfactory.' Dr. F. G. Lee's 
life of Hawker, which appeared simultaneously 
with Mr. Baring-Gould's, has never been popu- 
lar, as it confines itself almost wholly to mat- 
ters of religious controversy, being partly a 
defense of Hawker's position and partly an 
attack on liberalism in the Church of England. 
Hence the need of a new, full, and authorita- 
tive account of this singular and interesting 
man. 

Of great events, as commonly understood, 
our vicar's life has none to show. He was bom 
at Plymouth in 1803, being the eldest son of a 
physician, who afterward entered the church, 
and grandson of a well-known Calvinist 
preacher. The youthful pranks of Robert 
Hawker, his fertility in harmless practical 
jokes, and the various forms in which his 
excess of animal spirits found vent, would fill 
a book — if it were not too large. But not to let 
the rollicking lad's love of fun scandalize these 
decorous pages, we hasten on to his amazing 
marriage, in 1823, when he was not yet twenty, 
to Charlotte Elizabeth I'ans, a well-to-do spin- 
ster of more than twice his age. Hawker was 
at that time an Oxford student, and we have 
been told, wrongly it now appears, that his mar- 
riage was precipitated by his father's announce- 
ment that the family exchequer could no longer 
meet the expense of the young man's education. 
However that may be, the strangely assorted 
pair enjoyed many years of wedded happiness, 
until in the order of nature the senior partner's 
place was left vacant, whereupon (but with no 
indecorous haste) the sexagenarian survivor 
sought consolation in the arms of a second 
wife, this time young enough to be his grand- 
daughter, with wh om the last eleven years of

Vicar of Morwenstow. By his Son-in-Law, C. E. Byles. 
Illustrated. New York: John Lane. 



his life appear to have passed no less pleasantly 
than the preceding forty. He died in 1875, 
having held the living of Morwenstow a little 
over forty years. His first charge, the curacy 
of North Tamerton, covered only four years, 
and need not claim our notice further than to 
introduce an incident illustrating his unfailing 
readiness of resource from his very youth, and 
also his delightful unconventionality even in 
the pulpit. 

'One day a labourer at Tamerton came to Hawker 
in great trouble, saying that a sack of potatoes 
had been stolen from his garden, and would his 
Reverence kindly help him to discover the thief. 
It was Sunday, and they were on their way to 
morning service. "Well, well," said Hawker, "we 
will see about it after Church." He was taking 
the sermon that day, and he preached on the eighth 
commandment. "And now," he said, "I have a 
sad tale to tell. One of our neighbors has missed 
a sack of potatoes from his garden, and the thief 
is even now sitting among you. He has a feather 
on his head!" A man in the congregation was 
observed surreptitiously to put his hand to his 
head, and so the guilt was brought home.' 

A word in passing as to those foregleams of 
the coming man that we discern in the young 
Oxford student. To ' star-eyed science ' it does 
not appear that he devoted himself with any 
enthusiasm. Neither for the niceties of clas- 
sical scholarship nor for the rigors of higher 
mathematics do we read that he developed any 
taste. The Newdigate prize, however, was 
awarded him for a poem entitled ' Pompeii,' 
which a harsh critic has declared to be an imi- 
tation of Macaulay's prize poem on the same 
subject written at Cambridge eight years 
before. But Mr. Byles makes a good defense 
against this charge. Conviviality, a fondness 
for giving champagne breakfasts, and a readi- 
ness to take the lead in any daring escapade, 
seem to have been young Hawker's distinguish- 
ing qualities. The historian of Pembroke col- 
lege links his name with that of Thomas Lovell 
Beddoes under the heading, ' Two Eccentric 
Poets,' and mentions that some of his ' extra- 
ordinary letters' are still preserved in the col- 
lege library. With something of contempt for 
book-learning, and with some truth too, Hawker 
writes in later life, ' A patient and persevering 
man is always more likely to prosper at the 
universities than one whose genius would shine 
in ordinary life.' Somewhat astonishing (or 
perhaps not astonishing, for nothing need sur- 
prise us in Hawker) is his opinion of Addison's 
style. ' It is one of the lamentable blotches on 
Oxford,' he writes to a nephew about to enter 
Pembroke, 'that they select such a miserable 
composer of sentences as Addison was for trans- 
lation [into Latin]. His parenthetic pages, 
sometimes never ended at all, are about the 
worst elements ever selected to form a clear

and simple style.' (Peace to the shades of that 
earlier and more famous Pembroke scholar 
whose contrary opinion has gained general 
acceptance.) 

It will be easily believed that the vicar of 
Morwenstow was an excellent story-teUer. 
Humor, imagination, and the power to keep his 
gravity of countenance when uttering the most 
astounding assertions, made him a source both 
of delight and of bewilderment to all his 
acquaintance. Indeed, as the author tells us, 
* this habit of hoaxing became so ingrained in 
his nature that perhaps, as he grew older, he 
was hardly able himself to distinguish between 
jest and earnest, fact and fancy, belief and 
simulated belief.' But this inability to draw a 
sharp boundary line between the real and the 
imaginary made him no whit less acceptable to 
children, who quickly recognized in him a 
delightful pla^Tnate, one who never failed to 
respond to that magical watehword of the nur- 
sery, * let's pretend.' ^ One pervading princi- 
ple of Holy Writ,' he notes in his thought-diary, 
' is fondness for little children's weal.' That 
such a man, living in a remote maritime dis- 
trict famous for its superstitions, should have 
himself fallen a victim to superstition, espe- 
cially religious superstition, is not surprising. 
In a letter to his brother Claud he gravely 
describes a storm that had threatened to destroy 
his wheat, until he stilled the tempest by erect- 
ing two wooden crosses, one of them inscribed, 
Imperat ventis, and the other. Dixit mari, Tace. 
' They were fixed and consecrated,' he says, ' by 
six o'clock in the evening, amidst so fierce a 
gale that the carpenter could hardly hear the 
service on the cliff. But the Prince of the Air 
heard it and obeyed.' (In this and subsequent 
quotations the good vicars prodigal use of cap- 
itals is left to be imagined.) His diary con- 
tains the following, under the heading 
' Ghosts' : 

'We know that demons are loose. "We are told 
that the messengers of Satan are volatile, and fiU 
the air. We read that angels glide to and fro. Why 
may not the souls of our beloved traverse the air 
on the errands of their lovef 

StiU another passage, whether from diary or 
letter is not made clear, describes the hair-rais- 
ing experience the vicar had with a ghost in 
the course of a drive one bright summer day. 
Pale with fright, the holy man luckily be- 
thought him to make the sign of the cross, at 
which the spectre fled. ' It was,' he concludes, 
*a kind of nameless and indefinable sensation, 
rather than the sight, that assured me it was 
preternatural : at least, so I thought and think.' 
One little circumstance may serve to explain 
this pronounced propensity for horrors and 
marvels. Hawker was an opium-eater. He 
took the drug first as a medicine — thev all do — 



and afterward from habit. His biographer 
inclines to think that much of his beet poetry 
was written under the influence of opium. But 
the inevitable reaction followed in moods of 
irritability and deep depression. like De 
Quincey, he broke himself of the habit in later 
life, but resumed it some years before his death. 
Among the more admirable qualities of this 
richly endowed nature was a warm love for ani- 
mals. Over them he exerted something of 
Thoreau's influence. To the birds especially 
he was a friend and benefactor. A paragraph 
from his diary illustrates this in a way that is 
both touching and amusing. ' Beans and peas/ 
he writes, *are interdicted by the jackdaws. 
We have sown twice, and twice they have 
devoured them all. And a scarecrow, put up 
by my old man, was so made up in my hat and 
broken cassock that they took it for me, and 
came around it looking up to be fed.' Cats and 
dogs abounded in his house, and even followed 
him to church, where they behaved with great 
propriety. His horses obeyed his voice without 
help of whip or rein. All animals he believed 
to be immortal. 

Dwelling on the coast and seeing much of 
shipwreck, both accidental and * assisted,' 
Hawker naturally reverts to the theme in many 
of his letters. A characteristic passage may be 
quoted. The date is December, 1859. 

'Since 1843 I have taken up from the rocks and 
buried 27. But to me the great comfort is that 
the souls of all these men are grateful to me for 
the respectful interment of their bodies, and that 
all they are permitted to do for me they fulfil. 
That they have brought me tokens of good will 
I am persuaded. Do you know, I was surprised to 
hear you doubt that the dead know what we do. 
I thought the Scripture clear about this. Besides, 
how otherwise can we account for the appearance 
of spirits for especial purposes to the living! And 
that they do so appear everybody in every nation 
under heaven believes.' 

Let us not begrudge our poet-parson whatever 
happiness he found in his primitive beliefs. 

The best thing in Mr. Byles's book is Hawk- 
ers account of a visit he received from Tenny- 
son. The poet came unannounced and unrec- 
ognized in the month of June, 1848, roaming 
over Cornwall in quest of material for his 
' Idylls of the King.' It was a lucky chance, 
or a wise design, that brought him to the vicar's 
door; for no one was more in love with or bet- 
ter versed in the Arthurian legends than 
Hawker. The meeting of the two poets has 
been already very briefly told by one of them; 
the subjoined is a part of the other's fuller 
account : 

*I found my guest at his entrance a tall, swarthy 
Spanish-looking man, with an eye like a sword. 
He sate down and we conversed. I at once found 
myself with no common mind. All poetry in par- 
ticular he seemed to use like household words, and

as chance led to the mention of Homer's picture of 
night [Iliad, viii., 557-559] he gave at once a ren- 
det-ing simple and fine: "When the sky is broken 
u|> and the myriad stars roll down, and the shep- 
herd's heart is glad." It struck me that the trite 
translation was about the reverse motion of this. 
"We talked then about Cornwall and King Arthur, 
ii^y themes, and I quoted Tennyson's fine account 
of the restoration of Excalibur to the lake. Just 
then he said, "How can you live here thus alone? 
You don't seem to have any fit companions around 
you." My answer was another verse, from 
^^JjQcksley Hall"— 

■ "'I to herd with narrow foreheads vacant ot our 
'•'!!, glorious gains, 

f.l 1 Like a beast vrith lower pleasures, like a beast 
with lower pains ! " 

''Why, that man," said he, "seems to be your 
favourite author." "Not mine only, but Eng- 
land's," answered I. . . . I proposed to show 
my unknown friend the shore. But before we left 
the room he said, "Do you know my name?" I 
said, "No, I have not even a guess." "Do you 
^sh to know it ? " "I don 't much care — * that 
Which we call a rose,' " etc. "Well, then," said 
he, "my name is Tennysonl! " . . . So we grasped 
hands, and "the shepherd's heart was glad." We 
went on our way to the rocks, and if the converse 
could all be written down it would make, I think, 
as nice a little book as Charlotte Elizabeth [Mrs. 
Hawker] could herself have composed. All verses- — 
all lands — the secret history of many of his poems, 
which I may not reveal — ^but that which I can 
lawfully relate I will.' . ' T' 

And with this fillip to his appetite the reader 
of this review is referred to the book itself for 
the remainder of a memorable interview. 

From Hawker's own pen much might 
be quoted to complete this brief sketch of the 
man. Among . minor peculiaritiess was his 
abhorrence of a bearded clergy. ' Nothing/ he 
maintains, * can mar a man's character like that 
one thing, a beard. By one of the councils 
which are named in our Articles, and which 
all the clergy at least have vowed to obey, 
beards are forbidden to be worn by the clergy 
at all. So that every clergyman who wears one 
is a rebel against the authorities of the church 
— lowers himself to the level of a lay-person and 
degrades his sacred office.' Thus even Hawker's 
freedom from most forms and conventions was 
balanced by an almost superstitious observance 
of others. It can be truly said of him that he 
never took the impress of what he himself 
called 'the smoothing-iron of the nineteelith 
century/ but, again to use his own words as 
applied to the Cornish clergy of an earlier gen- 
eration, ' became developed about middle life 
into an original mind and man, sole and abso- 
lute within his parish boundaries, eccentric 
when compared with his brethren in civilized 
regions, and yet, in German phrase, "a whole 
and seldom man " in his dominion of souls.' 

Hawker the poet, the ballad-writer, is far 
less familiar' to the world than Hawker the vicar 
of MotwenstdW. Longfellow held his verses in 



high esteem and included i a number of his bal- 
lads in his ' Poems of Places.' His biographer 
might well have reprinted the famous but now 
obsolescent Trelawny ballad, which can soon 
boast an antiquity of fourscore years, having 
first appeared, anonymously, in 'The Royal 
Davenport Telegraph and Plymouth Chronicle ' 
of Sept. 2, 1826. Among those who took the 
piece for a genuine antique were Sir Walter 
Scott and Lord Macaulay, and Hawker seems 
to have had some difficulty afterward in con- 
vincing the public that the refrain and only 
the refrain was ancient, and that he was respon- 
sible for the rest. 

And so, with the author, we take leave of a 
' unique and winning personality, strong 
enough to disregard convention, and free to 
develop in solitude a peculiar charm. In the 
retrospect of those long years of Morwenstow, 
we remember chiefly his charity to the poor, 
his care for the shipwrecked, his hospitality to 
friend and stranger, his tenderness to all living 
creatures, his whole-hearted devotion to wife 
and child and home. Such is the abiding mem- 
ory of Eobert Stephen Hawker.'

A Musical, Encyclopedia.* 



!N'one of the arts has been more copiously 
and, it may be added, detrimentally endowed 
with reference helps than music. Detri- 
mentally, because its dictionaries and lexicons, 
as well as its biographies, in many instances, 
abound in errors, and the despair of the situa- 
tion is that once these errors appear in a given 
lexicon nearly every subsequent lexicographer 
incorporates errors and all into his own work, 
without once stopping to investigate or verify. 
There has been little original source-work done 
in musical dictionaries for fifty years past, 
except by Fetis, Mendel, and Riemann. Nearly 
everything has been second hand, and plagiar- 
isms have been particularly audacious. The 
musical student, unless he is an expert, has been 
misled by inaccuracies and exasperated by omis- 
sions in his reference books. 

When Sir George Grove's ' Dictionary of 
Music and Musiciaiis ' appeared in 1878 it met 
a hearty Welcome everywhere. Its need was 
recognized, for the dictionaries above mentioned 
were growing antiquated, and, besides this, it 
was the first dictionary in the English language 
that made any pretensions to breadth of scope, 
comprehensiveness of treatment, or accuracy of

statement. Nearly all the other works of the 
kind were either imperfect or in some manner 
untrustworthy. Sir George Grove himself had 
accomplished so much in the way of original 
research, had made so many important musical 
discoveries, and was such a well-trained and 
thoroughly equipped musical scholar that it 
was hoped a dictionary had at last appeared 
which would answer the needs of those not 
ters6d in foreign languages. As far as the 
work went, this expectation was gratified. 
Some of its biographies, especially those of 
Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schubert, are 
masterpieces. Its technical contributions are 
searching and quite exhaustive, and its histori- 
cal matter as a rule accurate and reliable. But 
although the two volumes originally announced 
grew into four, numerous omissions were dis- 
covered when consultation began. An appendix 
was added to supply these omissions, but even 
then they were numerous and (as a further 
illustration of the doctrine of the total deprav- 
ity of inanimate things) of course it was just 
the particular thing that was particularly 
wanted which was not in its pages. The 
American student was also greatly disappoint- 
ed, because scarcely an allusion was made to 
any American topic. These defects, however, 
were compensated for by the excellence of the 
dietionarj-^s general content, and for many 
years it has proved of such value that it has 
come to take the place of the German works. 
N"or have the recent reference works of Elson, 
Champlin, and Baker (the latter a very import- 
ant and handy guide in all matters Ainerican) 
affected its popularity in this country, notwith- 
standing its failure to recognize American sub- 
jects, which have been growing steadily in dig- 
nity and importance. 

It is now more than a quarter of a century 
since the first instalment of Sir Greorge 
Grove's work appeared. The time has come, 
therefore, for a new edition, for large numbers 
of new lights have appeared in the musical 
world, many subjects in the old dictionary 
require amplification, and science has pushed 
its researches so far that much new matter has 
been brought to the surface, requiring state- 
ment. Mr. Grove was engaged upon tiie pre- 
liminaries of such an edition when death over- 
took him in his labors and the work had to be 
entrusted to another hand. 

The publishers made no mistake when they 
selected Mr. J. A. Fuller Maitland for the 
editorial task. He has been musical critic for 
' The Thunderer,' assisted Sir George Grove in 
the original preparation of the Dictionary, has 
written some important works in musical biog- 
raphy, edited several, and translated that mon- 
umental work, Spitta's ' Life of Bach.' He has 



brought to his task musical scholarship, attain- 
ments in languages, journalistic experience, and 
love of research. The first instalment of his 
painstaking and scholarly labor has now 
appeared, and it deserves to be called not mere- 
ly a revision of the Grove Dictionary but the 
beginning of a new dictionary ; for while it fol- 
lows the general plan of the old one, and con- 
tains much of the old matter, yet even the old 
matter has been most carefully edited and 
arranged mOre systematically. Unimportant 
items have been omitted, and some errors cor- 
rected. The longer biographies, especially 
those of Bach and Beethoven, have been 
enriched and their compositions have been tab- 
ulated with all the care which Kochel or Notte- 
bohm display in their theme catalogues. The 
general change may be inferred from the fact 
that the first volume of the old edition contains 
768 pages, closing at the middle of the letter 
* I,' while the first volume of the new edition 
has 800 pages and only reaches the close of 
' E.' The cause of this difference is sufficiently 
apparent. Intending to have but two volumes, 
half of the alphabet was put in the first, and 
this explains its scantiness of material and the 
disproportion between the first and the remain- 
ing three volumes. It was a serious error, but 
it has been rectified and the proper balance 
effected by the inclusion of 417 new topics, 
besides brief mention of authorship and first 
performances of all important operas, which 
Mr. Grove almost entirely overlooked, although 
they are of great value as references. 

The new articles of leading importance are 
on ' Acoustics,' with many diagrams, * Auto- 
matic Appliances,' * Baireuth,' ' Chester Music 
Festivals,' ' Coronach,' * Conducting,' profusely 
illustrated, ' Concert Institutions in Paris,' 
' Concert Stiick,' * Dance Music,' ' Dodeka- 
hedron,' and ' Degrees in Music' The new 
biographies are those of Albani, Audran, Briill, 
Bruckner, the Breuning family (Beethoven's 
earliest friends), Marianne Brandt, Bruneau, 
Bottesini, Borodin, Busoni, Bononcini, Boito, 
Ole Bull, Beriot, Balakirev, Burmester, Cur- 
wen, Cui, Calve, Campanini, Capoul, Carreno, 
Carvalho, CeUier, Chabrier, Charpentier, Co 
lonne, Duparc, Ben Davies, Ffranggon Davies, 
Debussy, Dedekind, Delibes, Dolmanyi, Dvordk, 
and Elgar. Of these thirty-six names, fully 
one-half should have been in the first edition, 
which of itself shows its serious omissions. 
Besides this, the inadequateness of treatment 
displayed in such biographical sketches as those 
of Bach, Berlioz, Brahms, Chopin, and a few 
others has been remedied by fuller historical 
detail and critical analysis, which gives the 
reader a clearer idea of the style and character- 
istics of the composer. It is surprising, how- 



312

ever, that the editor should have retained the 
error in the life of Sebastian Bach that attrib- 
utes the ' Lucas Passion ' to that composer. It 
should be within the recollection of all Euro- 
pean music scholars that when the Spitta ' Life 
of Bach' appeared, our own Bernhard Ziehn, 
whose musical scholarship and critical faculty 
are even better known in Germany than here, 
proved beyond dispute that the ' Lucas Pas- 
sion ' was not written by Sebastian Bach and 
thus prevented the inclusion of a spurious com- 
position in the Bach G^sellschaft's famous edi- 
tion — a feat in critical analysis that was per- 
sonally acknowledged by Robert Franz, one of 
the most learned of the Bach students. It is to 
be hoped before the editor gets to the letter * Z ' 
he will have heard of this profound musical 
theorist, and in connection with his biography 
correct the error. 

It will be a grateful announcement that the 
new edition contains many and valuable refer- 
ences to American musicians, — and this for the 
first time in any European musical dictionary. 
The list includes adequate biographical sketches 
of Mme. Albani, Frederick Archer (who may 
be classed as American, for his best work as 
organist and conductor was done in this coun- 
try), Mrs.-H. H. A. Beach, Arthur Bird the 
composer (who has spent most of his time in 
Berlin), David S. Bispham, Lilian Blauvelt, 
Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler, Dudley Buck, Carl 
Bergmann, Annie Louise Gary-Raymond, 
George W. Chadwick, Dr. Leopold Damrosch 
and his sons, Walter and Frank, John S. 
Dwight (who did such a great work for higher 
music in this country half a century ago), the 
music house of Ditson & Co., Emma Eames, 
Clarence Eddy, and Julius Eichberg. Topics 
of a general nature treated are the American 
Guild of Organists, Boston Musical Societies 
(with a picture of Symphony Hall in that 
city), and the Cincinnati Musical Festivals. 

All of these American topics are treated in 
the main with the comprehensiveness and accu- 
racy due to the subjects. It is to be regretted 
that the name of Billings, the father of Amer- 
ican psalmody and the first in the line of 
American composers, should have been over- 
looked. The history of this sturdy American, 
whose anthems were as inspiring to the revolu- 
tionary camps as were the Bach Chorales at 
Rossbach and Torgau in the Seven Years' War, 
and whose somewhat crude but sonorous hymns 
marked the complete liberation of the New 
England churches from that English compen- 
dium, the Bay State Psalm Book, and other 
works sent over from England for the spiritual 
edification of the colonists, deserved a place in 
sucli a dictionary as this. 

As; a rule these topics are characterized by 



praiseworthy accuracy, but we must disagree 
utterly with the writer of the brief sketch of 
Carl Bergmann in his statement that ' Theodore 
Thomas's tastes and talents were largely devel- 
oped under Bergmann's influence.' This is 
grossly incorrect, as shown in the memorials of 
Mr. Thomas just published. Mr. Thomas was 
first closely associated with Mr. Bergmann as 
first violinist in the Mason-Bergmann cham- 
ber concerts, inaugurated in New York City in 
1855, — an event by the way which the writer of 
the sketch entirely ignores. From the very 
beginning, Mr. Thomas, as Mr. Mason, Mr. 
Mosenthal, and Mr. Matzka, the other mem- 
bers, acknowledge, was the master spirit of that 
organization. He dictated its general policy, 
its programmes, its interpretation, and its man- 
ner of performance. Out of personal regard 
for Bergmann, Mr. Thomas is very careful in 
his statements, but those on the inside know 
that Bergmann was jealous of him and had lit- 
tle sympathy with his musical radicalism, and 
that the friction at last was so strong he with- 
drew in a short time and the organization be- 
came the Mason-Thomas instead of the Mason- 
Bergmann, but not until Mr. Bergmann once 
confessed to him, ' you have lifted the veil from 
our eyes.' Neither Mr. Thomas's tastes nor his 
talents were developed under Bergmann's in- 
fluence. Both were manifest before the men 
came together. Mr. Thomas announced his 
tastes publicly when he formed his first orches- 
tra in 1862, — ' the highest music, perfectly 
played.' In his autobiography he mentions the 
only man who had any influence upon his tal- 
ents,! — Carl Eckert. 

The Cincinnati Musical Festival history is 
told succinctly, and the principal choral works 
performed in the first fifteen festivals are 
appended. It is to be regretted that the first 
volume had to go to press too early to include 
the colossal programme of the Sixteenth Festi- 
val (1904) which were the crowning works in 
Mr. Thomas's Cincinnati career, and which will 
always remain as a monument to his genius in 
programme-making and programme-perform- 
ance. They would have been an object lesson to 
the Old World, illustrating the musical 
advancement of the New, for in none of the 
European festivals, the Three Choirs, Birming- 
ham, Leeds, Norwich, Sacred Harmonic (Lon- 
don), Vienna, or the Lower Rhenish, has such 
a colossal series of programmes been presented 
as at Cincinnati in 1904, — the last great work 
of the great conductor. 

The Boston Musical Societies are treated in 
the order of their age, and the careful and 
ample detail of their description is an indica- 
tion that all the musical institutions of this 
country will be adequately represented in the,

succeeding volumes. The societies described 
are the Handel and Haydn, Harvard Musical 
Association, Apollo Club, the Cecilia, the Knei- 
sel Quartette, Choral Art Society, and Boston 
Singing Club. A cross reference promises a 
history of the Boston Symphony Orchestra 
under * S}Tnphony Concerts,' and it will be a 
matter of local interest in this connection that 
there is a similar cross reference for the Chicago 
Orchestra; all of which shows the painstaking 
labor that has been expended upon this new 
edition and the great advancement in method 
and research as compared with the work of its 
original compiling. 

The salient features of the first volume of the 
new dictionary have now been sufficiently set 
forth, and assuming that the remaining foui 
volumes will represent the same standard of 
musical scholarship and will contain similar 
results of careful and accurate labor, it will not 
be premature to announce — and this, too, with- 
out any disrespect to the memory of Sir 
George Grove as a scholar — that at last we have 
an English musical dictionary not only worthy 
to be compared with the French and German 
dictionaries but surpassing them all in the 
lateness of its information and in its compre- 
hensive scope. To all intents and purposes, Mr. 
Fuller Maitland and his associates have given 
us a new ' Dictionary of Music and Musicians.' 
Its scope has been greatly enlarged, as will be 
seen by the following statement in the preface : 
*TJpon the first edition a limit of time was 
imposed, the date 1450 being fixed as the begin- 
ning of the music that could be expected to 
interest modem readers. The study of ancient 
music, and in particular of that which belongs 
to ecclesiastical plainsong, has been so widely 
spread (partly as a result of the scientific arti- 
cles written by the late W. S. Rockstro in the 
latter part of the Dictionary) that no book on 
music could now be considered complete which 
made its starting-point as late as the middle 
of the loth century.' It is not alone in the 
enlargement of its scope that this Dictionary 
has been improved. By amplification and more 
adequate treatment of leading topics, exact 
statement, supplying of omissions, critical 
analyses, correct arrangement of compositions 
under opus numbers, absolutely new articles 
which should have been included in the old edi- 
tion, and the recognition of the new material 
that has been supplied during the last twenty- 
five years, the editor has given the world for the 
first time a reliable and comprehensive Diction- 
ary of Music in English, and has constructed 
an enduring monument to his musical scholar- 
ship. 

In its typography and general arrangement 
the book is entirelv satisfactorv. but some of 



the portraits are unworthy of the general high 

standard. They look like half-tones reproduced 

from half-tones, which are never satisfactory. 

The frontispiece, a portrait of Beethoven, is 

open to this criticism, and besides is not as 

characteristic or as faithful a likeness as might 

have been selected. The chalk drawing by von 

Kioeber, or the pen sketch by Lyser, would 

have been more desirable than the meaningless 

and spiritless one that has been used. Few 

great men have suffered more at the hands of 

artists than Beethoven. ^^^^ t» t-,.,^^..

The Story of a Great Monopoly.* 



The importance of the Standard Oil Com- 
pany is due not so much to its own history as 
to the fact that the profits made through it, 
the methods created by it, and the men elevated 
on account of it have found their way into 
other industries in which the experience of the 
older organization has been used to create new 
concerns. Thus there has come into existence 
what might be called a net-work of Standard 
Oil influences which touch many industries, 
many interests, and many communities. The 
numerous statements and facts concerning this 
remarkable company, together with the exist- 
ence of documents illustrating its entire his- 
tory, have led Miss Tarbell, under the stimulus 
of magazine direction, to undertake the present 
* History of the Standard Oil Company.^ 

In the prospectus to the work issued by the 
publishers the public is informed that this his- 
tory is not controversial and therefore inspir- 
ing; it is not written to prove a preconceived 
theorj-; it is a legitimate study of a thirty 
years' industrial warfare based on documents; 
and the interpretations of the documents are in 
the light of an intimate knowledge of the oil 
industry and of the men engaged in it. As 
though to impress the reader still further with 
the scientific value of the book, another sentence 
is added to the effect that 'every statement, 
ever}- interpretation of fact, every important 
step, is backed by documentary evidence,' This 
sets a high standard, which if attained would 
place the book in the position of an authority 
for all time upon its subject. 

In the gathering of material for a work of 
this kind four courses may be followed: (1) 
the interviewing of persons contemporaneous 
with the times; (2) the study of public opinion 
as voiced in public prints, such as newspapers 
and pamphlets; (3) the perusal of contracts,

price-lists^ legal cases, and printed documents; 
(4) the study of reports of legislative bodies, 
testimony and exhibits of witnesses before 
investigating commissions. Miss TarbelFs book 
gives evidence of an examination of the mate- 
rial that would be brought to light by following 
these methods, although her failure to cite 
authorities in foot-note references makes it 
almost impossible at points to verify some of 
the most important statements made in the 
book. In the interpretation of this material the 
author has undoubtedly been influenced by her 
long association with the people of the * Oil 
Eegions' and the sharing of the feeling there 
prevailing against the common enemy, the 
* Standard.' Despite the statement of the pub- 
lishers to the contrary, a thesis is to be found 
running through the book; this, however, does 
not in the least vitiate its value. This thesis 
may be stated in the following way: The oil 
industry in its early stages * had workers in 
great numbers with plenty of capital, who were 
pieeting every difficulty and overcoming them,' 
which promised 'the normal unfolding of a 
new and wonderful opportunity for individual 
endeavor.' This natural development was pre- 
vented by the Standard Oil Company, which 
was able by its methods to secure a monopoly 
and take away this grand opportunity from 
individual enterprise. In the chapter on ' The 
Birth of an Industry ' the thesis is almost 
unconsciously continued in these words : ' But 
what had been done was, in their judgment only 
the beginning. . . They would meet their 
own needs. They would bring the oil refining 
to the region where it belonged. They would 
make their towns the most beautiful in the 
world. There was nothing too good for them, 
nothing they did not hope and dare. But sud- 
denly, at the very hey day of this confidence, a 
big hand reached out to trottle their future.' 
The rise of the Standard Oil Company took 
place simultaneously with the competition of 
three' railroads for the oil traflBc and three cit- 
ies for the business of refining. In this com- 
petition, rebates and discriminations were the 
outcome, as they were bound to be in unre- 
stricted industrial conflict. It was what each 
railroad expected of the others, and what each 
city expected to fight. We are told that by 1871 
every refiner suspected that his neighbor was 
getting better rates than he; moreover, the 
refiniij^ business seemed to be overdone. Out 
of sucn chaotic conditions the South Improve- 
jnent Company was bom, and though the strug- 
gle, against it was successful nevertheless an 
unseen hand drew the bonds tighter about the 
oil business by shutting off oil, cutting down 
the supply of cars, and taking over customers. 
The plan proposed by the South Improvement 



Company was in effect what has been done a 
hundred times in other ways since that day. 
No more recent example need be cited than the 
cattle trust. Secretly the promoters of the 
South Improvement Company made contracts 
with the railroads; by a mistake the plot was 
discovered, and thereupon began what Miss 
Tarbell calls ' the Oil War of 1872.' The alarm 
and indignation of the oil producers can only 
be imagined; through this feeling an organiza- 
tion was created that fought successfully the 
South Improvement Company. The result was 
the abandonment of the frames, but not the 
annihilation of the framers, of this remarkable 
movement. The rebate system, however, had 
been tested; it could be used at another time. 

The fight against the Standard Oil Company, 
thus begun in its effort to control transporta- 
tion, has continued at different intervals for 
the same reason. So far as economic grounds 
are concerned the contention as to whether the 
shipper of large tonnage shall be granted a 
lower rate than the prevailing one for concen- 
trated traffic remains unsettled. It took no 
great argument to persuade the railroads of the 
soundness of this position, and even to go fur- 
ther in the payment of rebates on shipments 
made by other concerns. Although the oil pro- 
ducers and independent refiners were able to 
break up the South Improvement Company, 
nevertheless its successor, the Standard Oil 
Company, controlled the business of refining 
oil by 1875. 

Even after the result just referred to, the 
Standard Oil Company had three great prob- 
lems to solve: (1) the regulation of crude 
production; (2) the control of pipe lines and 
transportation facilities; and (3) a final form 
of organization that would escape the criticism 
of the law. 

The machinery of the company's organiza- 
tion was thoroughly tested by the efforts of the 
producers to raise the low prices of crude oil a* 
compared with refined. To do this the pro- 
ducers looked to the creation of a pipe line 
to the sea-board and sale of export oil, and the 
regulation of interstate commerce by Congress. 
Both of these projects were for the time defeat- 
ed, and the discovery of new oil fields made the 
task of keeping the price of crude oil at a low 
point an easy matter. There was, however, an 
appeal to the law still open to the producers. 
In 1879 a suit was brought against the officers 
of the Standard. Though vigorously prose- 
cuted for a time, delay of the proceedings in 
1880 brought out strongly the power of the 
Standard to manage recalcitrant officers and 
bitter opponents, and to win a result known a^ 
the ' Compromise of 1880.' This may be 
regarded as a victory for the company for the 



1905.]

reason that the great hopes of the oil producers 
were in no respect realized. 

One opening still remained to the producers. 
To take advantage of it they must build a pipe 
line to the seaboard. Under the able manage- 
ment of Messrs. Benson, McKelvey, and Hop- 
kins, a pipe line was completed in 1881. Thus 
the Standard was brought face to face with its 
second great problem. After a period of two 
years the Standard, by successful maneuvering, 
secured an agreement with the Tidewater Pipe 
Line, and was able to control the transportation 
of oil by this means as well as by rail. By 1887 
the Standard had reached tihe highest efficiency, 
and wished to be let alone; but a rapid series 
of events brought greater attention to its meth- 
ods than ever before. The Buffalo case, the 
Rice contest and the Pa}Tie imbroglio, together 
with the defeat of the oil men's bill in the 
Pennsylvania legislature, stirred the country 
tremendously. Demands for investigation and 
requests for knowledge about the mysterious 
power came thick and fast from all parts of the 
land. As a result there followed the New York 
and Congressional investigations, the suit of 
the State of Ohio against the Standard Oil 
Company and its dissolution on paper. 
Through the leniency of the courts the situation 
did not differ materially from what it was 
before the dissolving order of the courts. It 
remained for another Attorney General of the 
State of Ohio, Hon. Frank S. Mannett, to com- 
plete the dissolution, forcing the company to 
meet its third problem, that of law-proof organ- 
ization, and to create a great holding company, 
the Standard Oil Company of Xew Jersey. 

During this legal contest the producers made 
another attempt to secure their freedom, but 
the Standard now entered the oil fields as an oil 
producer, carrying consternation into the ranks 
of the producers. The one escape open to the 
independents, as before, was an outlet to the 
sea. After many difficulties and great vicissi- 
tudes the United States Pipe Line was built; 
and in time an organization of independent oil 
refiners, despite the most hostile opposition, was 
created in what was called the Pure Oil Com- 
pany. It is through the organization of these 
companies that competition exists in the field 
of oil production. It was, however, a result 
profoundly different from that hoped for by 
the pioneers in the oil business. 

In looking back over the history of the Stand- 
ard Oil Company one is impressed with the 
shrewdness of the men behind it, the real great- 
ness of the company, its economies and admir- 
able methods of handling business. But against 
this are to be contrasted the espionage of the 
business of competitors, the manipulation of 
Ifigiglatures, the determination of rates, the 



securing of rebates, and the harassing of com- 
petitors. The Standard Oil Company would 
have been in any event a great company, but 
the methods used in forestalling competitioii 
have made it a monopoly. "' 

It is of relatively little importance whethef 
every statement made in Miss TarbelFs book 
is absolutely true. The real question is as to 
whether or not she has pictured the history of 
the Standard Oil Company in its true light, and 
has presented correctly the methods practiced 
by this organization and its agents. In tiie 
judgment of the reviewer, the author has 
accomplished both of these tasks in so just, 
clear, and attracti/e a manner as to entitle her 
to the thanks of every American citizen. Tlie 
book is a genuine contribution to that knowl- 
edge of the real inwardness of things industrial 
which Americans as a people so lack.

The Sotjtherxeb's Problem.* 

Mr. Thomas Nelson Page has collected, in a 
book of some three hundred pages, certain 
articles recently contributed by him to 
' McClure's Magazine,' in answer to the uumi- 
swerable argument of Carl Schurz, together 
with several earlier essays of his on the race 
problem. The result is a book the central 
interest of which is psychological rather than 
scientific, — that is, it presents the brief for 
the South, of a Southerner of distinction, who 
while not a friend of the Negro race is certainly 
not to be counted an enemy. 

A careful dissection of the book reveals some 
interesting evidences of growth and feeling. 
The first essay chronologically is Chapter VII., 
written some fifteen years ago and published 
first in another volume. This essay is brought 
down to date by Chapter II., with some repeti- 
tion. Similarly Chapters VI. and I. elaborate 
Mr. Page's only real contribution to the race 
problem in the years of his writing and observa- 
tion, — viz., his account of the training and con- 
dition of the house servant on the best Virginia 
plantations. Two chapters are given to special 
pleas on the subjects of lynching and disfran- 
chisement, and a hastily constructed and inac- 
curate chapter deals with the present condition 
of the Negro. The book ends with a suggested 
solution of the Negro problem notable for its 
breadth and good temper on the one hand and

on the other for its singular agreement with all 
that the Negroes themselves and their friends 
have ever demanded. 

Mr. Page begins by asserting that *no man 
can entirely dissociate himself from the condi- 
tions amid which he grew up, or free himself 
from the influences which surrounded him in 
his youth. The most he can do is to strive 
earnestly for an open and enlarged mind and 
try to look at everything from the highest and 
soundest standpoint he can reach.' Throughout 
most of the book there is evidently a sincere 
effort to keep this judicial attitude, but this is 
seriously marred by careless statements of fact 
and particularly by Mr. Page's large reliance 
on the authority of William Hannibal Thomas, 
and his approval of the monstrous assertions 
of Thomas's book. For instance, to assert that 
'murder might easily have been done' in the 
Boston ' riot ' of some years since is an unfor- 
tunate exaggeration; the story of Sam Hose 
is not at all in accordance with the published 
facts, since many honest men do not believe 
he was guilty of any crime but that of murder. 
Then, too, the character of Thomas and the 
unreliability of his book have been too often 
exposed to permit of this being made the basis 
of reiterated slander upon the American Negro. 

The brief for the South as held by Mr. Page 
is made up of the following points: 1, That 
Slavery gave the Negro excellent training; 2, 
That the mistakes of Reconstruction alienated 
master and freedman; 3, That the freedmen's 
sons and the sons of the masters are growing 
further and further apart; 4, That the Negrc 
is capable of some but limited improvement; 5, 
That by education he should be given a chance 
to improve. 

To one like Mr. Page, whose youthful dreams 
centered on a Virginia plantation of the better 
sort, amid trained family servants and the old 
lazy prosperity of the Southern gentleman of 
the kindlier regime, it seems a monstrous thing 
to condemn slavery as an inhuman and cruel 
system. It was not this, Mr. Page again and 
again declares; rather it was 'a. relation of 
warm friendship and tender sympathy' (p. 
166), 'the "driver" of slave-horror novels was 
as purely the creature of the imagination as 
Cerberus, or the Chimera' (p. 167), often 'the 
affection of the slaves was stronger toward the 
whites than toward their own off-spring' (p. 
174), and the slaves had in many instances ' the 
education which comes from daily association 
with people of culture.' Mr. Page was only 
eight years old when the war broke out, and so 
he knows slavery largely by tradition. Never- 
theless, believing the tradition true, Mr. Page 
resents slurs on slavery, and he has in his 
contention just enough of right to make it next 



to impossible for him to realize his error. It 
is as inaccurate to call Southern slavery bar- 
barous as it is to call the modem wage system 
ideal; but it is not inaccurate to say that 
Southern slavery fostered barbarism, was itself 
barbaric in thousands of instances, and was on 
the whole a system of labor so blighting tc 
white and black that probably the only thing 
that saved Mr. Page's genius to the world was 
the Emancipation Proclamation, — the very deed 
that allows the present reviewer the pleasure 
of criticising Mr. Page's book instead of hoeing 
his cotton. Mr. Page is dean of that school 
of Southern writers which has in recent years 
pictured the Southern planter as a sort of 
demigod. The world has accepted this por- 
traiture in good-humored silence, recognizing 
it as a generous tribute of the New to the Old 
South; nevertheless, it is perfectly clear that 
the Southern gentleman of yesterday was an 
ordinary human being, kindly, indolent, chol- 
eric, and self-indulgent, neither better nor 
worse than the ordinary run of men. It is 
inconceivable that a laboring class placed under 
the complete dominion of such a man should 
prosper; and with all the instances of kindness 
and affection (and there were hundreds of such 
instances) the net result of any such system 
was, and was bound to be, oppression, cruelty, 
concubinage, and moral retrogression. That 
this was the result in the South, one can read 
even in the dry reports of the United States 
Census. 

How far it was possible in the days of recon- 
struction to have acted more wisely than the 
nation did will always be a mooted question. 
Men like Mr. Page, however, forget that in 1864 
practically every Southerner was convinced that 
free Negro labor was impossible, and was 
determined to keep the substance of slavery 
even if he had to surrender the name. Under 
such circumstances there were but two ways 
open : either to establish government guardian- 
ship over the Negroes ; or, by making them full 
citizens at once, to let them guard their own 
rights. The first would have been the wiser 
course, but the South frustrated it. The South 
attacked not simply the working of the Freed- 
men's Bureau but its basic principle. When 
that Bureau fell, what was left but enfran- 
chisement? Only slavery, and war had just 
made slavery impossible. 

That estrangement should follow between ex- 
master and freedman was inevitable. Who 
should be blamed for it, — the intelligent mas- 
ter or the ignorant man? Surely to base the 
Ku Klux Klan on the Union League of 
Negroes, as Mr. Page virtually does, is as 
ungenerous as it is unhistorical. It was inevi- 
table that for one or two generations after 



1905.]

emancipation the parties whose relations were 
disturbed should regard each other with dis- 
like, suspicion, and distrust. And the fault 
of the Southern whites has been that they have 
sought to increase this feeling by exploiting 
it in political and social life, placing personal 
and public humiliations on black people, em- 
phasizing, publishing, and gloating over every 
mistake and foible of a struggling people, and 
hindering their progress in many directions by 
law and custom. 

It is, however, in Chapter III. (and partially 
in Chapter VII.) that the crucial points of ^Mr. 
Page's attitude are evident. This chapter seeks 
to prove that no great amount of development 
can be expected of black people. The sincere 
belief in this has quite evidently preceded the 
massing of the facts, so that any fair student 
would simply say that the case was ' not proven.' 
The negative testimony of Africa and Hayti, 
with all its weight, is inconclusive. His earlier 
argument that no Negroes of ability had ap- 
peared in America, Mr. Page has had to 
modify even in the short space of fifteen years' 
experience, and the present argument that 
' exceptional N'egroes but prove the rule of infe- 
riority ' sounds like a retiring to inner lines of 
fortification. Then, too, there may well be 
considerable difference of opinion as to whether 
or not the accumulation of two hundred and 
thirty millions of dollars in farms in one gen- 
eration is a sign of Negro thrift; Mr. Page 
thinks it is not, and hastens to the more con- 
genial subject of crime, where the testimony is 
more vague and mystifying. 

Tlie trouble with this whole argument is that 
an assumption of the unchangeable inferiority 
of a race of men inevitably leads to actions 
that hinder their development. If these Negroes 
cannot become ordinary civilized human beings, 
why waste time offering them opportunities? 
This is the inevitable conclusion of such phi- 
losophy, and although Mr. Page stops half way 
and insists on education and opportunity for 
blacks, makes the excellent suggestion of black 
police, and defends an intelligent black vote, 
yet the mass of his compatriots in the South 
sweep on far beyond him and act on the phi- 
losophy that Professor William Benjamin Smith 
has recentlv published in his volume entitled 
'The Color Line.' 

^Mr. Smith's book is a naked, unashamed 
shriek for the survival of the white race by 
means of the annihilation of all other races. 
He says bluntly : 

'Compared with the vital matter of pure Blood, 
all other matters, as of tariff, of currency, of sub- 
sidies, of civil service, of labour and capital, of 
education, of forestry, of science and art, and even 
of religion, sink into insignificance. For, to judge 
by the past, there is scarcely any conceivable edu- 



cational or scientific or governmental or social or 
religious polity under which the pure strain of Cau- 
casian blood might not live and thrive and achieve 
great things for History and Humanity; on the 
other hand there is no reason to believe that any 
kind or degree of institutional excellence could per- 
manently stay the race decadence that would follow 
surely in the wake of any considerable contamina- 
tion of that blood by the blood of Africa' (p. IX.). 

Moreover, the author does not stop there. If 
'contamination' is to be avoided, whites and 
Negroes must not live in the same land, nor 
eventually upon the same earth. Not even indi- 
vidual exceptions can save the lower race from 
this judgment. 

'Does some one reply that some Negroes are bet- 
ter than some Whites, physically, mentally, mor- 
ally! We do not deny it; but this fact, again, is 
without pertinence. It may very well be that some 
dogs are superior to some men' (p. 15). 

Nor is the Negro race alone condemned; the 
Chinese must go, the Japanese are questionable, 
and of course the Malays, East Indians, Turks, 
and such people are inadmissible. In fact, 
the majority of humanity is doomed by reason 
of ' disease, vice, and discouragement,' and the 
prophecy of this consummation so devoutly to 
be wished ought, in Mr. Smith's opinion, 'to 
be stamped in letters of gold on the walls of 
the Public Library in Boston and over the pul- 
pit of Plymouth Church in BrookljTi, on the lin- 
tels of the White House, and on the title-page 
of all future editions of "The Independent" 
and " The Nation " ' (p. 185) . 

Such a book could easily be passed over in 
silence, did it not state flatly and with unneces- 
sary barbarism a thesis that is the active belief 
of millions of our fellow countrymen. In vain 
may we smile at the author's hysterics, and 
criticise his slovenly composition; in vain may 
we remind ourselves that this arrogant mani- 
festo of the Princes of the Blood is an out- 
break of world-old pharisaism and brute self- 
assertion; in vain may we remind Mr. Smith 
that nations live for Mercy, Justice, and Truth, 
and not simply for breeding; and that since 
some do^ kill their enemies quickly instead 
of tantalizing them to death by ' disease, vice, 
and discouragement,' this may prove more dogs 
superior to men than he admits. All this argu- 
ing is beside the point ; some men think in this 
wise, and this is the heart and kernel of the 
Negro problem. This is the new barbarism of 
the twentieth centurj-, against which all the 
forces of civilization must contend. Can the 
world conquer it as it has already partially con- 
quered caste and religious persecution and 
feuds ? Mr. E. A. Johnson, author of the vol- 
ume entitled 'Light Ahead for the Negro,' 
recently published, believes that we can. His 
little book, written by a man of Negro blood, 
is curiously yet not unattractively pieced

together in the form of semi-fiction, and con-

hero has asked, in this millenium, of the fate 
of such books as Mr. Dixon's and (may we 
add?) Professor Smith's:

history had not forgotten, but who lived only in 
ridicule and as examples of error. She seemed to 
be ashamed of the ideas once advocated by these 
men, and charitably dismissed them with the remark 
that, "It would have been better for the cause of 
true Christianity had they never been listened to 
by so large a number of our people, as they repre- 
sented brute force rather than the Golden Eule." ' 

'I heard with rapt attention. Although I had 
already seen much to convince me of .the evolution 
of sentiment in the South, these words sank deeper 
than all else. Here was a woman of aristocyatie 
Southern blood, cradled under the hills of secession 
and yet vehement in denunciation of those whom I 
had learned to recognize as the beacon lights of 
Southern thought and purpose! And when I re- 
flected that her views were then the views of the 
whole South, I indeed began to realize the wonder- 
ful transformation I was being permitted to see.'

The Father of American Caricature.* 

It has been pointed out that the Civil War 
made American caricature what it is at the 
present day — one of the most dominating fac- 
tors utilized in formulating public opinion. It 
required very little imagination on the part of 
the artist to make the tall figure of President 
Lincoln appear grotesque, and his many 
strongly marked peculiarities supplied both 
friends and enemies with subjects for ridicule. 
The stirring times from 1861 to 1866 brought 
to view the greatest caricaturist this country 
has ever J^nown — Thomas Nast. In his new 
biography of Nast, Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine 
says that one of the trophies most highly prized 
by the artist was a vase, in the shape of an 
army canteen, representing America decorating 
the cartoonist in the presence of the army, and 
bearing on the reverse side the inscription: 
'Presented to Thomas Nast by his friends in 
the Army and Navy of the United States, in 
recognition of the patriotic use he has made of 
his rare abilities as the artist of the people; 
the gift of three thousand five hundred officer? 
and enlisted men in the Army and Navy of 
the United States.' 

Nast was born at Landau, Bavaria, Septem- 
ber 27, 1840, but left Germany for this coun- 
try before the breaking out of the revolution 
that culminated in 1848. At twenty years of 
age, having shown great skill with his pencil,

he was sent to England to make illustrations^ 
for the ' New York Illustrated News,' of the 
international prize-fight between Heenan ajid 
Sayers, at that time an unparalleled proof of 
newspaper enterprise. So unusually successful 
was he in this venture that he was ordered to 
Italy to join General Medici in the famous 
campaign in which Garibaldi freed Sicily and 
Naples and created the Kingdom of Italy. 

In February, 1861, just before the breaking 
out of the Civil War, he returned to America. 
His campaign in Italy had given him a war 
experience such as no other artist possessed. 
The strong patriotic interest which he took in 
the Rebellion raised his work to the level of the 
heroic. Lincoln acknowledged that his power-* 
ful emblematic picbures were the best recruit- 
ing sergeants for the North. Nast worked in 
a field peculiarly his own. His designs at this 
time were of a serious character, setting forth 
as they did— sometimes emblematically in pic- 
torial allegory, sometimes in direct and strik- 
ing presentment — the many and mutable phases 
of the great war. Pictorial humor and satire 
were his weapons of might, and beneath their 
allegorical exterior were concealed the most 
profound convictions, the most direct! insistence 
on reforms, the most pointed exposure of 
shams. Always earnest and never cynical, he 
had but one view and end ever in mind — the 
moral and political advancement of the people 
and the nation. ' The cartoonist who accom- 
plishes anything worth while,' said N ast, short- 
ly before his death, ' must have his own deep 
convictions that the target at wldch he is aim- 
ing is the right one to attack. Looking over 
my experiences as a cartoonist I deem it one 
of my most satisfying reflections that I never 
allowed myself to attack anything I did not 
believe in my soul was wrong and deserving of 
the worst fate that could befall it.' 

Nast assisted in electing Lincoln the second 
time; and after the Ctmfederate Army had 
laid down its arms at Appomattox Court 
House, he became an ardent advocate of tem- 
perance reform. In this noble cause he won a 
noble battle, putting a stop to one of the most 
intemperate social customs of the day. His art 
had become a ' mighty engine of warfare.' It 
was during the period of reconstruction and 
corruption which invariably follows the 
upheaval of a great country that his work 
achieved the highest point that satiric art has 
ever reached in America. Nast's work at that 
time betokened at once the power of the artist 
and political satirist combined, — a talent that 
but few in the history of art possessed. Kaul- 
bach in Germany had it, as is splendidly shown 
in his 'Reynard the Fox'; Hogarth, Gilroy, 
Cruikshank, and Tenniel had it in English art.

But none of these ever dictated a policy or 
caused a national refonn. To municipa] 
reform Xasf s pen became a battery of artallery,. 
shooting shrapnel at the common enemies of 
freedom and the purity of the ballot-box. The 
exposure of the Tammany Ring and the flighi 
of Tweed's confreres are matters of world-wide 
knowledge. Tweed admitted that Nast cari- 
catured him so often and so sharply that he 
began to look like his counterfeit presentment 
— ^hat coarse, obese figure, those insolent deep- 
set eyes, those thousand and one little char- 
acteristics that are still identified in the public 
mind with fraud incarnate. Nasfs cartoons in 
those days were not the paid work of a mere 
artist hired to carry out the directions of 
another, but the crystallization of his own 
personal antagonism to what he knew was one 
of the most brazen attempts to rob by whole- 
sale in the history of any municipality. 

Comparing the cartoons in the Tweed days 
with those of the present time, Mr. Paine says : 

'Today the merit of our cartoons lies mainly in 
their technique and the clever statement of an 
existing condition. They are likely to be the echo 
of a policy, a reflection of public sentiment, or the 
record of daily events. The cartoons of Thomas 
Nast were for the most part a manifest, a protest 
or a prophecy. They did not follow public events, 
but preceded them. They did not echo public senti- 
ment, but led it. They were not inspired by a mere 
appreciation of conditions, but by a powerful con- 
viction of right and principle whch would not be 
gainsaid. The altered attitude of our pictures to- 
day is not due to the individuals but to the condi- 
tions. Nast began when the nation was in a flame 
of conflict. When the fierce heat of the battle had 
subsided, it left the public in the ebullient forma- 
tive state where human passions run high and 
human morals and judgment are disturbed. At 
such times strong human personalities leap forth to 
seize the molten elements and shape the fabric of 
futurity. Such men have little place today. The 
New York Herald said not long ago, editorially: 
"The press of America merely mirrors public opin- 
ion instead of commanding it." And it is this 
that the cartoonist of the present day must be con- 
tent to do. He can but mirror the procession of 
events — not direct them.' 

It was Xast who gave dignity to the ' anthro- 
pomorphic symbol of American ideas and opin- 
ions ' — UncLe Sam ; depicting him no longer as 
the lean buffoon of former years. He also pos- 
sessed in a remarkable degree the faculty of 
throwing individuality into articles of apparel 
and personal belongings; in fact, in many of 
his pictures he merely indicated the personality 
of his subjects in this way — such as Oakey 
Hall's eyeglasses, Horace Greeley's hat, the 
dollar-mark and money-bag for Tweed's face. 
The first of animals to take its definite place in 
the history of American caricature was the 
donkey. Xast's first application of the donkey 
to Democracy was on January 15, 1870, when 



he represented it as the ' Copperhead (demo- 
cratic) Press' kicking the dead lion, E. M. 
Stanton. Shortly afterwards the Eepublican 
elephant and Democratic donkey took definite 
shape in 'Harpers Weekly.' Speaking of 
Xasf s enduring influence on the art of cari- 
cature, the present biographer says: 

' Being the first, it was necessary for him to estab- 
lish fundamentals, to construct the alphabet of an 
art. The work was not arbitrarily done, nor were 
the results due to accident. The symbols which to- 
day confront us on every hand were each the inevit- 
able expression ot some existing condition Which 
by strong, sure mental evolution found absolute 
embodiment and became a pictured fact. We can 
no more efface them than -ve can erase the char- 
acters of our spelling-book.' 

It was but a question of time when iiie jwib- 
lic would no longer demand pictorial crusades; 
Nasf 3 business relations with ' Harper's 
Weekly ' became strained, and he finally found 
himself practically robbed of a means of liveli- 
hood. For a while he met with success on 
the lecture platform, but at last this also failed. 
' Somehow the gentle and pathetic figure of 
Don Quixote cannot fail to present itself to 
those who in his final days were familiar with 
the dreams and struggles and disappointments 
and with the lovable personality of Thomas 
Xast.' It was in March, 1902, after Mr. Eoose- 
velt had become President, that Xast received a 
letter from his old friend, Hon. John Hay, 
Secretary of State, offering him the consular 
post at ' Guayaquil, Ecuador. Though Xast 
feared the climate, he needed the position, and 
accepted it. On Sunday, December 7, 1902^ 
he succumbed to yeUow fever far away on the 
Pacific coast. 

Xast's art was remarkable for its fertility of 
invention and that clear graphic style which 
insured it the popularity that waits on sim- 
plicity. In defining his position in the world 
of art, Mr. Paine says : 

'There is a divine heritage which rises above 
class drill and curriculum — a God-given impulse 
which will seek instinctively and find surely the 
means to enter and the way to conquer and possess 
the foreordinated kingdom. Such a genius was that 
of Thomas Nast. Lacking a perfect mastery of 
line, he yet possessed a simplicity of treatment, 
an understanding of black and white color values, 
with a clearness of vision, a fertility of idea, and, 
above and beyond all, a supreme and unwavering 
purpose which made him a pictorial power such as 
this generation is not likely to know again. Per- 
haps aU this is not art. Perhaps art may not be 
admitted without the grace of careful training — 
the touch that soothes and fills the critic's eye. 
But if it is not art, then, at least, it is a genius of 
no lesser sort. There are men who will tell you 
that Grant was not a general. There are other* 
who will hold, that Nast was not an artist. Yet 
these two were mighty warriors — each in his own 
way — and the world will honor their triumphs when

Masters of the Early and Late 
Rexaissance.* 



It is too much to expect anything but very 
unequal merit in the different volumes of 
series of monographs on artistic subjects. An 
editor must choose his writers as he may, with 
the inevitable result that certain books will 
fall below the standard set by the best of the 
series. The excellent beginning made by the 
' Library of Art ' in its two early volumes on 
Bonatello and Michael Angelo led the reader 
to hope for a set of monographs of almost uni- 
form excellence. But the inevitable inequality 
of such a series is illustrated by the mediocre 
character of the first of the three books 
forming the latest additions to the series, — 
' Mediaeval Art ' by Mr. W. R Lethaby. The 
volume is devoted chiefly to the history of 
architecture from the year 300 a. d. to 1300 
A. D. It opens with chapters on Byzantine 
art in the East and in Italy; then follow 
passages on Eomanesque art in various coun- 
tries; finally there are chapters on Gothic art 
in different European states. The treatment 
is so cursory that the reader often finds little 
more than a list of monuments. 

The chapter on ' Gothic Characteristics ' 
might be expected to offer a definite field for 
criticism, but it proves to be only a compila- 
tion from other writers; moreover, it does not 
marshal its facts in systematic order. There is 
the bias usual with British writers when deal- 
ing with this subject. Anyone who knows the 
work of Viollet-le-Duc, Louis Gonse, and C. 
H. Moore is not inclined to accept the more 
superficial view of English writers, and our 
author does not even come up to the very mod- 
erate standard of the best British criticism. 
•His exposition, so far as it goes, is not clear, 
and it is evident that he has no proper grasp 
of the fundamental principles of his subject. 
After a rapid review of Gothic art in France, 
England, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and 
Germany the volume ends with a still slighter 
and less satisfactory discussion of Gothic archi- 
tecture in Italy.

Mr, Lethaby's book as a whole shows no new 
grasp of the subject, no general principle or 
underlying philosophy whereby to coordinate 
many artistic movements. It is profusely illus- 
trated, as are all the numbers of the series, and 
is provided with a good index. 

Miss Maud Cruttwell's volume on Verrocchio 
is a scholarly and appreciative monograph of 
great importance. Until the appearance of 
this book, the only serious work devoted to 
this fifteenth century master was that by 
Mackowsky in the *Kiinstler Monographien.' 
But this is published only in German, and is 
neither as accurate nor as stimulating as the 
present volume. A battle of criticism has been 
waged about the work of this master ever since 
Bode's and Morelli's vituperations and diatribes 
of nearly thirty years ago. "Verrocchio has 
indeed presented many difficult problems, one 
of the most interesting of which relates to the 
early works of his great pupil, Leonardo da 
Vinci. Miss Cruttwell brings to her task a 
long residence in Italy, years of training in 
the writing of three earlier volumes of impor- 
tance, especially the monograph on the della 
Robbia, and she applies the methods of modem 
connoisseurship to the various mooted questions. 
In her introduction she says: 

* Verrocchio is perhaps the least known and appre- 
ciated of the great masters of the fifteenth cen- 
tury. The supreme excellence of those works which 
are proved by documentary evidence to be authentic 
is disregarded as the standard of judgment as to 
quality and style, and a quantity of inferior sculp- 
ture and painting is attributed to him for which his 
feeble imitators are responsible.' 

Not only has this been true, but critics have 
judged our master by his earlier, more angular, 
and less beautiful paintings. He was pre- 
eminently a sculptor, and his mature works, 
such as the ' David ' and the ' Boy with the Dol- 
phin ' in Florence and the ' Bartolommeo Col- 
leoni ' in Venice, prove that in his acquaintance 
with anatomy and the laws of movement, in 
his draughtsmanship and technical skill, he was 
inferior to none of his contemporaries, and that 
in breadth of vision and imaginative power he 
was excelled only by Donatello and Leonardo. 
Moreover, ^with an impeccable accuracy in 
representation and a vigoroi^ and facile exe- 
cution, he combined the poetry, the depth of 
feeling, and the wide sympathies of the idealist.' 
How different, and how much truer, is this con- 
clusion from M. Muntz's dictum that Ver- 
rocchio is ' narrow and bourgeois ' and his work 
''commonplace, angular, and dry.' 

There is a popular interest in Vasari's tale 
that Verrocchio left his painting of ' The Bap- 
tism' unfinished, and that Leonardo da Vinci 
added one of the angels in the foreground; 



1905.]

whereupon, the story goes, the older master 
was so discouraged that he never touched 
brush again. On the contrary, our author 
proves by detailed analysis that this angel shows 
the same hand as that which executed the rest 
of the picture, and she cites documentary evi- 
dence to the effect that Verrocchio continued 
to work for many years afterwards. The dis- 
cussion of this picture in connection with ' The 
Annunciation' by Verrocchio in the Uffizi and 
the smaller painting of the same subject by 
Leonardo da Vinci in the Louvre is the occasion 
of some excellent critical writing in regard to 
the latter. Take as an example the following 
passage in regard to Leonardo's style: 

'The most remarkable quality of Leonardo's 
work is its vivacity, a vivacity noticeable in the 
slightest of his engineering sketches and even in 
his handwriting. The least touch of his pen, pencil 
or brush is rapid and vividly alive. It is sensitive, 
yet decisive. It darts and scintillates like flame, 
giving to the painting or drawing, even when the 
subject represented is tranquil in sentiment, an ex- 
cess of life almost fantastic. In his earliest work 
known to us, the predella panel of the "Annuncia- 
tion ' ' in the Louvre, this vivacity is present to so 
great a degree that the solemnity of the theme is 
almost marred by the alertness and briskness of the 
figures. Each touch of the brush in hair and wings 
and grasses sparkles with life.' 

Another passage that deserves notice is the 
discriminating comparison of the artistic styles 
of Pollaiuolo and A'^errocchio. Scientists and 
draughtsmen par excellence in a school of nat- 
uralists and linealists, these two masters are 
the very bone and marrow of quattrocento art; 
and their relative characteristics have rarely 
been so well defined as in Miss Cruttwell's 
words. 

Some profile portraits of women, notably 
that in the Poldi Pezzoli Museum in Milan and 
another in Berlin, which are ascribed to Piero 
della Francesca, are attributed by Berenson to 
Verrocchio. It seems to us that they are cer- 
tainly works of the Florentine rather than of 
the Umbrian school, which would exclude Fran- 
cesca's authorship. Miss Cruttwell, however, 
does not accept these beautiful likenesses of 
women as works of Verrocchio, and indeed 
attributes to our master none of the ]\Iadonna 
pictures bearing his name. In this we follow 
her with approval, for these Madonnas in Lon- 
don. Berlin, and elsewhere certainly show the 
work of several hands. It is by such conclu- 
sions that the authentic works of the master 
are to be distinguished from mediocre school 
pieces. In the list of his genuine works she 
gives him only three paintings : ' The Baptism ' 
in the Florentine Academy, 'The Annuncia- 
tion '" in the Uffizi, and the portrait of a woman 
usually ascribed to Leonardo in Prince Lichten- 
st^in's collection at Vienna. 



Miss Cruttwell gives in an appendix the text 
of documents, some of them discovered by her- 
self, which bear on various questions, and thus 
enables the reader to verify her conclusions. 
In her account of the painter's life she is 
judicial and cautious, while she adds ma- 
terially to our information on the subject. 
Although the present monograph has not 
decided all the difficult problems presented 
by this sphinx of fifteenth century art, it is a 
step towards that result, and is an important 
and stimulating c-ontribution to the history of 
art, a masterly exposition of Verrocchio's com- 
manding position as painter and sculptor. 

The volume on Titian by Dr. George Gronau 
is a translation of a work published in Germany 
four years ago. New material has, however, 
been added, and the whole brought up to date. 
The work is avowedly based on Crowe and 
Cavalcaselle's 'Life and Times of Titian,' in 
two volumes; but since this was published 
research has added much to our knowledge of 
the great Venetian master. Dr. Gronau has 
himself been a diligent investigator of docu- 
ments and interpreter of paintings; he is 
both historian and connoisseur, and it is 
partly due to this twofold equipment that we 
now have a volume of such unusual value. The 
book is popular in that it is avowedly written 
for the general reader, but the writers judicial 
insight and scholarly equipment have enabled 
him to pack an incredible number of details 
into small compass, to give us a masterpiece 
of condensation which possesses at the same time 
breadth of view. He deals with the different 
groups of paintings, — as the early portraits, 
the Giorgionesque Madonnas, the great altar- 
pieces, — in separate chapters without following 
a strictly chronological order. It might be an 
open question if this is the best method, but 
in case the deficiencies of such procedure are 
not thought to be more than made up for by 
its advantages (and we think they are), Herr 
Gronau gives at the end of the book a descrip- 
tive list of the paintings of the master, with 
comments on the date or probable period of exe- 
cution. This forms an admirable key for the 
study of Titan's artistic development in detail, 
and is of unique value, constituting the most 
important feature of the book alike to the ama- 
teur and the critic. 

Our author makes two additions to the mass 
of Titian's known paintings : he has discovered 
in the apartments of the Pitti Palace a portrait 
that he believes may be that of Giulia, Duchess 
of TJrbino, and he moreover attributes to Titian 
the remarkable portrait of a lady in the Crespi 
collection at Milan, which Berenson believes to 
be a copy of a lost Giorgione but which Cook

liolds to be an original Giorgione and the por- 
trait of Catherine Comaro. 
• Much new information is given in regard 
to many of the painter's princely patrons and 
his relations to the courts of Mantua and 
Urbino, while the important facts about the 
painter's life and ch^tracter are summed up in 
d masterly manner. One of the best chapters 
is that on ^Titian's Private Life, — Family, 
Home, Friends/ Additional points of interest 
are Dr. Gronau's belief that the so-called ' Dnke 
of Norfolk' in the Pitti is really a portrait 
of the Duke of Urbino, his discussion of 
Titian's Giorgionesque period, the emphasis he 
places on Palma Vecchio's influence on our 
master, and his chapter on Titian's technique. 
Although he writes on the latter subject with 
the modesty of a layman, and gives his opinions 
with reservations, we are bound to say tiiat his 
discussion of the great master's methods is the 
best contribution yet made to the subject. Of 
especial value also are his remarks on the art of 
portraiture on p. 131, his discussion of land- 
scape in Titian's work (pp. 166 et seq.), and 
the passage in regard to the painter's later style, 
the monochromatic effect of his most mature 
work (pp. 160, 161, and 162). This effect is 
seen in such of Titian's later pictures as his 
' Portrait of Himself ' in Madrid, painted at 
about the age of ninety, and his ' Christ 
Crowned with Thorns' in Munich. In dra- 
matic insight and power of interpretation 
wedded to the highest technical skill, certain of 
these late works are unexcelled, and are not 
generally appreciated as they deserve. 

One of the refreshing features of the book is 
the reproduction, among its abundant illustra- 
tions, of some of Titian's less known yet impor- 
tant pictures. A few of these unfamiliar sub- 
jects are : ' Jacopo Pesaro Doing Homage to St. 
Peter' (Antwerp), 'The Ariosto' (Cobham 
Hall), 'Venus' (Bridgewater House), *Doge 
Gritti ' (Vienna), ' Giulia, Duchess of TJrbino' 
(Pitti Palace), the 'Rape of Europa' (Gard- 
ner Collection, Boston), and the 'Nymph and 
Shepherd' (Vienna). 

Those who recall Dr. Gronau's sympathetic 
monograph on Leonardo da Vinci, published 
some two years ago, may at first feel disap- 
pointment at the comparatively oold treat- 
ment of Titian. It may seem that he is too 
tolerant of the great Venetian's poorer pictures, 
and not sufficiently appreciative of his master- 
pieces. But this scholarly restraint is in fact 
one of the great merits of the book. On this 
account it is much to be preferred to the more 
enthusiastic treatment of the well-known mono- 
graph by Mr. Claude Phillips; the German's 
critical balance and scholarly reserve are in 
striking contrast to the Englishman's bombast | 



and prose poetry. Indeed, Dr. Gronau's volume, 
marked by cautious accuracy and disinterested 
love of truth, is a model for works of its class. 
It is a thing of high art in itself, and is cer- 
tainly the best life of Titian that has appeared.

America's With the publication of Volumes 

historic XI. to XVI., Mr. Archer Butler 

highways. Hulbert's series of 'Historic High- 

ways of America' (Arthur H. Clark Co.) has 
been completed. Volumes XI. and XII., treating 
of 'Pioneer Roads,' begin with an account of 
the evolution of roads from the trail to the first 
American turnpike, built from Philadelphia to 
Lancaster in 1794. Much of this discussion 
repeats the matter of earlier volumes, though 
more attention is given to the means of trans- 
portation, beginning with the pack horse and 
developing, as the trail becomes a road, into the 
freighter and stagecoach. Four highways are 
described: first, the road beginning with Zane's 
trace from Wheeling to Zanesville, which was 
continued to the Ohio river at Mayesville and 
thence to Lexington, Ky.; second, the road built 
in 1832 by Virginia between Winchester and 
Parkersburg, which Mr. Butler calls the 'old 
Northwestern turnpike'; third, the Genesee road, 
built between 1794 and 1800 from Utica to the 
Genesee river and thence to Lake Erie; and, 
fourth, the Catskill turnpike, built in 1802 from 
the Hudson to the Susquehanna. The first three 
roads were selected for treatment by Mr. Hulbert 
because they were in the line of the early west- 
ward movement, and the last one, apparently, 
because an account of it existed ready-made in Mr. 
Halsey's 'Old New York Frontier,' which the 
author was permitted to borrow. The separate 
treatment of the Braddock, Forbes, and Boone 
roads in earlier volumes of the series prevents 
a logical development of the material, so that 
the relation of the various roads to each other 
is lost sight of. The greater part of the two 
volumes consists of accounts, drawn from various 
sources, of travel upon early roads. The narra^ 
tive, taken from Baily's 'Tour,' of a ride over the 
Pennsylvania road in 1796 is both interesting and 
instructive, and an heretofore unpublished let- 
ter describing a trip over Braddock 's road in the 
same year gives a faithful and pathetic picture 
of emigrant life. The remaining accounts are 
of slight value; the chapter from Hall's 'Legends 
of the West' is wholly imaginative, and the 
extracts from Dickens's 'American Notes' are too 
easily accessible to warrant reproduction. Vol- 
umes XIII. and XIV. are entitled 'Great Ameri- 
can Canals.' They furnish accounts of three 
canals: the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Penn- 
sylvania canals, in Volume XIIL, and the Erie 
canal in Volmne XIV. The former volume brings 
out in an interesting way the rivalry between 
the canal and the railway, which ended in the 



X905.1

easy triumph of the railway. The latter volume 
gives a convenient outline of the history of the 
Erie canal, which is particularly timely by reason 
of the great improvements that have recently 
been entered upon for the purpose of maintain- 
ing the commercial prestige of New York. Log- 
ically the order of the two volumes should have 
been reversed, since it was the success of the 
Erie canal that inspired the construction of the 
other canals. It goes without saying that the 
account of these three canals is very far from 
giving that comprehensive view of the era of 
canal building in the United States which it is 
very desirable to have, and which we naturally 
expected from the title of the series. Particularly 
surprising is the omission of the Ohio canals, 
which form a part of the history of the author's 
own state and which for so long a time performed 
a useful service in connecting the Great Lakes 
with the Mississippi system. Volume XV., 
entitled^ The Future of Koad-Making,' is a popu- 
lar treatise on good roads and the way to make 
them. It consists of five chapters by different 
hands. The first is an introductory discussion of 
the sociological importance of good roads by Mr. 
Butler himself. The second is an account of the 
OflSce of Public Road Inquiry of the Department 
of Agriculture, by the Hon. Martin Dodge, Direct- 
or of the Office. The third chapter is a reprint 
of a bulletin entitled 'Good Roads for Farmers,' 
written by Mr. M. 0. Eldredge, Assistant Director 
of the Office of Public Road Inquiry, and issued 
by the Department of Agriculture in 1899. This 
chapter, filling nearly half the volume, is devoted 
to practical directions for road making. Follow- 
ing it are two short chapters, one on 'Materials 
for Macadam Roads' by Mr. L. W. Page of the 
Road Material Laboratory of the Department of 
Agriculture, and the other on 'Stone Roads in 
New Jersey' by Mr. E. G. Harrison, Secretary 
of the New Jersey Road Improvement Associa- 
tion. Such a volume as this seems out of place 
in an historical series. It may, however, bring 
the work now being done by the Unit-ed States 
government in encouragement of the good roads 
movement to the attention of some who might 
not otherwise know of it. Volume XVI. is 
devoted to an index to the entire series. The later 
volumes of the series present both the merits and 
defects of the earlier ones. They are entertain- 
ing and often suggestive, but always incomplete. 
The material is ill arranged, and a surprising 
amount of it is reprinted from other books. 
Taken as a whole the work is more like a 'report 
of progress' than a finished product. 

A Ihttch 'Charge it to Huidekoper' was, 

philanthropist fifty years ago, a familiar phrase 
and pioneer. ^ western Pennsylvania, so numer- 
ous were Harm Jan Huidekoper 's beneficiaries, 
deserving poor bidden to draw on him to the 
extent of their needs. An excellent biography of 
this good man and hardy pioneer has been pre- 
pared by Mrs. Nina Moore Tiffany and Mr. 
Francis Tiffany, and is published by the W. B. 
Clarke Co. of Boston. Huidekoper 's early life 
in HoUand, his coming to America in 1796 at 



the age of twenty, his long and profitable con- 
nection with the Holland Land Company, chiefly 
as their agent at Meadville, Pa., his promoting 
of that town's interests, his exertions in behalf 
of religious «ilight«nnient and liberality, his 
founding of the first Unitarian .church in his 
part of the country, and later his and his son 
Frederic's snceessful endeavors (o start a theo- 
logical school at MeadviUe, and finally his 
lamented death in 1854,— all these and many 
other matters are set forth in due order and 
with abundant pictorial accompaniment. Extracts 
from Huidekoper 's correspondence are given, and 
especially interesting are his letters to James 
Freeman Clarke, who married one of his daugh- 
ters. Selections from his published writings prove 
him to have been a man of intellectual independ- 
ence and great moral force. Copious extracts 
from his manuscript autobiography also add to 
the value of the book. Modestly but unmistak- 
ably he shows himself to have been one of the 
makers of Pennsylvania. At once self-reliant, 
energetic, and earnestly thoughtful, he says, 'I 
have become thoroughly convinced that the most 
valuable part of a man's education is that which 
he gives to himself.' In that utterance lies much 
of the secret of his success in a pioneer life 
that presented problems for whose solution he 
had no one to whom he could turn. Another 
familiar saying, which is probably still current 
at Meadville, commemorates his breaking loose 
from the fetters of old-fashioned orthodoxy. 
'^ What is Unitarianism f Nobody knows but 
Huidekoper, and he won't tell.' Herein is sug- 
gested more truth than at first appears. To 
understand the aims and ideals of this creed- 
less sect, one must be of it ; and, more than that, 
no one member can speak for another. 

Of the men dealt with in Mr. 
oU^^tTrs. Charles Whibley's ' Literary Por- 
traits' (Dutton), Montaigne and 
Jacques Casanova have made full confession of 
themselves; Rabelais and Burton reveal them- 
selves more or less unconsciously in their works; 
Philippe de Comines hides himself completely 
behind his hero, Louis XI.; Drummond of Haw- 
thomden is known by the books he keep)S and by 
Jonson's lucky visit; and Holland by the confi- 
dences of a gossiping godson to Anthony a Wood, 
who transmitted gossip into biography. There is 
considerable difference, therefore, in the fulness 
of the portraits; some are not much more than 
sketches, others are full lengths. Rabelais and 
Montaigne are not only the best done but the 
best worth doing. Rabelais, whom we so identify 
with his work that we hardly think of the latter as 
possessing a name distinct from its author's, Mr. 
Whibley pictures as a learned and genial doctor, 
whose experience in the church made him satirize 
the monks with Aristophanic humor and the 
strong flavor of the esprit gatilois. He is more 
than the author of 'Gargantua' and'Pantagruel.' 
His work, too, is no mere ribaldry, though it is 
hardly so guileless as Mr. Whibley would repre- 
sent it. It does stand for freedom and beauty, 
and its tone is virile. It is in the vanguard of

[May 1, 



the intellectual Renaissance, and its author dared 
much to be an apostle of human progress. Mon- 
taigne, on the other hand, is not distinct from 
his work. His Essays give us almost as complete 
an idea of him as the 'Diary' does of Pepys, 
though, as Mr. Whibley remarks, in an entirely 
different way. Pepys records his daily doings 
with microscopic minuteness, and we draw the 
conclusion. Montaigne treats every experience as 
a means of testing his soul, of knowing himself, 
and he records his results. 'I have no business 
save with myself,' he says. *1 consider myself 
unceasingly; I control and taste myself.' Pepys 
never made such a confession, but he lived up 
to it just as completely. From his abundant 
material Mr. Whibley has only to select to make 
his portrait. The details chosen range from Mon- 
taigne 's eating so greedily that he often bit his 
tongue to his views on nature, life, and death. 
He appears so many sided, so divers et ondoyant, 
as he says himself, that every man feels kinship 
with him. But to say, as Mr. Whibley does, that 
'there is no circumstance of life, whose tangle 
these Essays may not unravel' is to mark just 
that extravagant enthusiasm which appears in 
nearly all these portraits. Rabelais was translated 
by Urquhart and Motteux, Philippe de Comines 
by Danett, and Montaigne by Florio, admirable 
translators all in the noblest period of English 
translation. They are the minor figures in Mr. 
Whibley 's interesting gallery. 



The first 
Christian 
emperor. 



In the ' Heroes of the Nations ' 
series (Putnam) the good work 
goes on apace; and the enterprise 
may now fairly regard its conclusion as approxi- 
mate,— unless, indeed, history shall continue to 
be made so rapidly as to necessitate several addi- 
tions to the niches in this Hall of Fame by such 
great captains as Nogi and Oyama, and even for 
some yet undiscovered latter-day Russian. How- 
ever that may be, thirty-nine biographies have 
been published, and the number announced as 
still in preparation is eleven; which makes a sus- 
piciously precise total of fifty. The round num- 
ber, however, may be the result of history's 
* evening up ' in the long run, rather than of 
any arbitrary predetermination of the editors' 
minds. The volume on Constantine the Great, 
the latest addition to the series, is the work of 
Mr. John B. Firth, an Oxford scholar already 
known to readers by his study of Augustus 
Caesar and his translation of Pliny's letters. The 
fii-st Christian emperor is an historic figure whose 
claim to the somewhat fortuitous title of * great ' 
was derived rather from his grasping the skirts 
of happy chance than from breasting the billows 
of circumstance. Mr. Firth recognizes this; and 
only insists that ' under his [ Constantine 's] aus- 
pices one of the most momentous changes in the 
history of the world was accomplished.' Of 
this period and of its central figure the author 
has written sensibly and satisfyingly. He has 
made the best possible use of his original author- 
ities, who, as he says, were practically without 
exception bitter and malevolent partisans, by a 
masterly divination of the truth, or the probable 



truth, in such polemics as Lactantius, Eusebius, 
and other Christian or pagan writers. His treat- 
ment of the legends surrounding Constantine 's 
conversion is rational without being unsympa- 
thetic; and in his deeply interesting account of 
the Arian controversy and the Council of Nice 
he has recorded the facts as he sees them, and is 
content to be a guide instead of a judge. He 
regards Constantine as a sincere and convinced 
Christian; although ' the Chrisbianity of the 
Emperor was grossly material, and worldly suc- 
cess remained in his eyes the crowning proof of 
the Christian verities.' The concluding chapter, 
' The Empire and Christianity,' is a scholarly 
survey of the real subject— epochal rather than 
individual— of the book. Constantine 's greatest 
political achievement was the founding of the 
splendid capital to which he gave his name; and 
in the long and fascinating chapter devoted to 
this subject, Mr. Firth malies free and grateful 
use of the sumptuous and standard work on Con- 
stantinople by an American scholar. Professor 
E. A. Grosvenor of Amherst College. 

The Napoleonic The history of the Bonaparte 
empire in I'egime in the kingdom of Naples 

southern Italy, jg described by Mr. R. M. John- 
ston in his two volumes entitled ' The Napoleonic 
Empire in Southern Italy' (Macmillan). It 
was a novel proceeding, to say the least, when 
Napoleon, by a simple proclamation addressed 
to his army, deposed Ferdinand and Caroline 
after the battle of Austerlitz. Although he 
did not take this step in the interest of the 
Neapolitans, but rather to establish French 
supremacy in that portion of the Mediterranean, 
his brother Joseph, and afterwards his brother- 
in-law Murat, employed enlightened Neapolitans 
and competent Frenchmen in sweeping away the 
vestiges of feudalism and in reorganizing soci- 
ety on the basis of the French system. So suc- 
cessful was this work that at the Restoration in 
1815 even the French code, with slight modifica- 
tions, was retained and was extended to Sicily. 
The present volumes do not treat social changes 
in much detail, merely describing the condition 
of the kingdom in 1805 and indicating how the 
work of reform was inaugurated. The principal 
emphasis is placed upon political and military 
incidents. The author is not inclined to think 
that England's control in the Mediterranean was 
as undisputed after Trafalgar as commonly sup- 
posed. One of the most interesting chapters of 
the first volume describes the Maida campaign 
,and the insurrection in Calabria during which 
such diverting cut-throats as Fra Diavolo played 
the leading roles. The principal figure of the 
volume is Joachim Murat, a spectacular if not 
an attractive pyersonality. Murat 's situation 
after the disastrous Russian campaign was too 
complex to be simplified by a hero of his cali- 
ber. The story of his fall and fate is told with 
vigor and judgment, and is the best part of the 
whole work. The second volume covers the 
period from 1815 to the end of the insurrection 
of 1820. Its theme is the influence of the secret 
societies, chiefly the Carbonari, upon the liberal

A. icieider of Where Major Arthur Griffiths finds

of entertaining reminiscences of army life, civil-

of warfare appears in his rapid and readable 
narrative: the light-hearted lad almost seems to 
have been playing at war. Of the terrible suffer- 
ings of the arm}' before Sebastopol he says 
barely a word. That he was plucky, popular 
with his fellows, and somewhat of a favorite with 
his superiors, may be read between the lines. 
Lack of funds to purchase a desired promotion 
led him to leave the military for the civil serrice 
after attaining the rank of major. More than 
once he hints at a leanness of purse that may well 
have familiarized him with the traditional sub- 
altern's repast, 'a glass of water and a pull at 
the waistbelt.' His pages perhaps now and then 
owe some of their attractiveness to a pardonable 
unwillingness to spoil a good story in the telling, 
as when he describes the skatmg at Halifax as 
extending 'over longer stretches of ice than are 
to be found anywhere else in the world.' The 
histor>- of his services as prison official contains, 
beside weightier penological matters, accounts of 
noted criminals, remarkable escapes, and other 
interesting incidents. The author's style has the 
unstudied fluency of one who is used to writing 
with the din of the printing-press in his ears 
and the boy at his side waiting for copy. The 
book is a worthy addition to the Major's long 
list of works, grave and gay. 



Primitive The virgin soU of Africa is rich 

customs in with the fruitage of centuries of 
West Afrtca. native-gTown superstitions and 
customs. Dr. Robert Hamill Nassau spent forty 
years in this land as a missionary. The service 
that he was required to render gave him excep- 
tional opportunities to study the thoughts, 
beliefs, and influential customs that form so 
large a part of the life of those ungrown races. 
Throughout the entire period of his service he 
carefully gathered facts on every phase of the 
native's life. These first-hand facts he has clas- 
sified and embodied in a volume entitled * Fetich- 
ism in West Africa ' (Scribner), a work of first- 
class importance to students of ethnology, sociol- 
ogy, and primitive religion. The author devotes 



most of his ^aee to the discussion of the fetich, 
as occupying chief place in the life of the native 
races of West Africa. Travellers who have made 
a hasty trip through that country and have ques^ 
tioned the natives as to their beliefs, have often 
reported that they had found a race so low in 
the scale of being as to have no idea of Grod or 
of a superior being. Dr. Nassau completely 
refutes every such statement, by citing cases 
where the native said what was understood as a 
denial of belief in a higher Being, simply to 
acknowledge his ignorance and inferiority in the 
presence of such learned and mysterious white 
men. Years of close study of many of the most 
degraded tribes have convinced Dr. Nassau that 
there is no race so benighted as not to have the 
knowledge of at least the name of God. He has 
carefully gleaned among several of these primi- 
tive peoples, and has become convinced that, 
with all their superstiti(m and mysterious white 
and black arts, they are jwssessed of a distinct 
and definite religious nature that can be reached 
and educated. 

Closely following Mr, William M. 
of *»Ento'iif Meigs's biography of Thomas Hart 

Benton appears one by Mr. Joseph 
M. Rogers. For this later book there seems to 
be slight excuse, except that it was called for 
in the 'American Crisis Series' (Jacobs), to 
which it belongs. The work is careless and super- 
ficial. The author gives us too few facts about 
Benton, too much apology for Benton, and too 
much of his own unauthenticated opinion. Mr, 
Rogers thinks that Benton was an important 
national statesman who was responsible for much 
sound legislation and many sound pKjlicies. But 
instead of exhibiting Benton's greatness, he pre- 
fers to belittle the contemporaries and opponents 
of Benton— Webster. Calhoun, Clay, and Doug- 
las—as men of selfish ambition, timeservers, 
trimmers, and intriguers. Evidently the author 
holds to the 'great man' theory of history, for 
he shows no appreciation of the influence of 
strong natural forces in American history. Of 
the social, pK)litical, and economic conditions. 
North and South, restdting in the long contro- 
versy over slavery, he displays a profound ignor- 
ance. The non-slaveholders in the South really 
possessed and very actively exercised political 
rights, though Mr, Rogers says the contrary. It 
is not correct to say that Benton lost his seat 
in the Senate because he opposed nullification, 
and that he was the 'first martyr to the slavery 
cause . . struck down by the slave power.' 
He failed of reelection because he was old, arro- 
gant, untactful, and out of touch with his con- 
stituents. He was not killed by defeat, but by 
an incurable disease of long standing, up>on which 
politics had no influence. It was not the memory 
of Benton that preserved Missouri to the Union, 
but natural forces aided by the Germans and the 
United States army. The book does not make 
one understand Benton the man, as does Mr. 
Roosevelt's, nor appreciate the value of the work 
of Benton the statesman, as does that of Mr. 
Meigs.

W i I - ► ; ' L ■' Mabel W. Daniels 's account of 
'An American Girl in Munich' (Little, Brown & 
Co.) is pleasantly written and full of delightful 
humor. In 'twelve long letters, written to an 
intimate friend, the author tells with charm- 
ing frankness her trials and pleasures during a 
year of musical study. She airs her German 
phrases with childish na'ivetS, translates them all 
carefully, and sometimes indulges in a bit of 
fine writing; but for these faults she atones by 
her clever characterization of people, vivid 
descriptions of street scenes and foreign cus- 
toms, as well as by clear and apt comment on 
musical matters. She succeeds remarkably in 
putting into words the impressions made by vari- 
ous symphonies and operas, and gives many 
delightful and not too familiar glimpses of her 
masters, Stavenhagen and Thuille, and of Ysaye 
and Carl Zerrahn. Stavenhagen 's remark, when 
Miss Daniels asked to join his class in composi- 
tion, is too good to be ignored. No woman had 
ever entered this class, but after solemn con- 
sultation with his secretary, the master said : 
'Because a Fraiilein never has joined the class 
is no reason why a Fraiilein never can,'— a 
point of view so un-German as to be truly 
refreshing. The pension, with its familiar fig- 
ures, is well drawn, while the interwoven love 
story turns out in a way almost too good to be 
true. 

A German The translation and republication 

advocate of at this time of Friedrich List's 
protectionism. , National System of Political Econ- 
omy' (Longmans) comes as a result of the recent 
protectionist movement in England. The work 
first appeared in Germany in 1844, and was 
intended as an offset to the extreme free trade 
views of some of the Adam Smith school of 
economists. It is a fairly able presentation of 
the protectionist argument. Having never been 
revised, however, it of course fails to deal with 
some of the more recent phases of that subject. 
The author was a moderate protectionist, believ- 
ing neither in prohibitive duties nor protection 
to raw materials. According to his theory there 
are two stages through which every country 
should ultimately pass; the third stage, that of 
free trade, supposedly being the final one in which 
it should remain. In 1844, according to this 
theory, England was the only country in Europe 
that was actually ready for this third stage. If 
England was ready for it sixty years ago, in 
the estimation of the author, it may be a ques- 
tion how much this book will aid the protectionist 
cause in that country after all. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Several recent additions to the charming 'Oaxton 
Thin Paper Classics,' imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner, comprise the following: Homer's Iliad 
and Odyssey, each in Chapman's translation; The 
Plays and Poems of Ben Jonson; Tke Autobiog- 
raphy of Benvenuto Cellini, in Thomas Boscoe's 



translation; and Coleridge's Poems, edited by Pro- 
fessor Knight. In similar form, and issued by the 
same publishers, is a volume containing the poems 
of Michael Drayton. All of these books are of 
pocket size, carefully printed, provided with photo- 
gravure frontispieces, and daintily bound in limp 
leather of various colors. 

Part IV. of Professor Charles Sprague Sargent's 
'Trees and Shrubs,' illustrating 'new or little 
known ligneous plants,' has just been published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Miflin & Co. This section com- 
pletes a volume of the work, and is provided with 
index and title-page. The plates illustrate thirteen 
species of Acer, and from one to three species each 
of seven other genera. 

Miss Esther Singleton's 'Venice, as Seen and 
Described by Famous Writers,' is the latest in the 
series of skilful compilations that we owe to its 
editor. It offers good reading, for the authors 
are such men as Ruskin, Symonds, Taine, Gautier, 
and H. F. Brown, while the two score of illustra- 
tions are intelligently chosen. Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co. are the publishers. 

'Social Progress' for 1905, edited by Mr. Josiah 
Strong, is published by the Baker & Taylor Co. 
This year-book of economic, industrial, social, and 
religious statistics is a highly valuable work of 
reference, and the second issue of the work shows 
a material advance over the first in usefulness. 
The amount of matter included is very large, and 
it is strictly up-to-date. 

The historical series of 'Publications of the 
University of Pennsylvania ' has received an impor- 
tant accession in Mr. Albert Edward McKinley's 
exhaustive study of 'The Suffrage Franchise in the 
Thirteen English Colonies in America,' a volume of 
over five hundred pages. An addition to the eco- 
nomic series of the same institution is Dr. J. Russell 
Smith's monograph on 'The Organization of Ocean 
Commerce.' Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the agents for 
these publications. 

A new series of 'French Classics for English 
Readers,' edited by Professors Adolphe Cohn and 
Curtis Hidden Page, has been inaugurated by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. These volumes are 
to be translations, rather than critical biographies, 
and the text's the thing, after a few preliminary 
pages of preface and book-lists. The subject of 
the volume which opens the series is Rabelais, and 
the text of the translation used is that of Urquhart 
and Motteux, purged of Ozell's 'improvements.' 
There are expurgations, of course, and the volume 
is one of selections only; nevertheless, the continu- 
ity of the story has been preserved, and the volume 
is big enough to reproduce the greater part of the 
five books. Professor Page is the editor of this 
volume. 

The Macmillan Co. publish, for the London Socio- 
logical Society, a volume of 'Sociological Papers' 
by Messrs. Francis Galton, E. Westermarck, P. 
Geddes, E. Durkheim, H. H. Mann, and V. V. Bran- 
ford, with an introductory address by Professor 
James Bryce, the President of the Society. Perhaps 
the most important of these papers are those by 
Messrs. Galton and Geddes, having for their respect- 
ive subjects ' Eugenics ' and ' Civics. ' The volume con- 
tains not only the addresses proper, but also the dis- 
cussions of this subject-matter when they were read 
before the Society, besides other miscellaneous mat- 
ter. They exhibit the Society as engaged in a 
very active sort of sociology, investigating real 
problems, and discussing the mo6t practical of 
issues, while by no means neglecting the theoretical 
aspect of their subject,

Notes. 



A second series of Mr. Paul Elmer More's ' Shel- 
bume Essays' will be published this month by 
Messrs. Putnam's Sons. 

A new novel by Mr. William Dean Howells is in 
preparation, and will be published by the Messrs. 
Harper during the early summer. 

The works of George Borrow wiU be issued shortly 
by the Messrs. Putnam in a new edition comprising 
five small, leather-bound, thin-paper volumes. 

About the middle of this month Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. will publish 'The Breath of the 
Gods,' a new romance by Mr. Sidney McCall, 
author of 'Truth Dexter.' 

Aristotle 's * Politics, ' in Jowett 's translation, with 
an introduction and other editorial matter by Mr. 
H. W. C. Davis, is a recent publication of Mr. 
Henry Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press. 

'A Short History of England's Ldterature, ' by 
Miss Eva March Tappan, is an elementary text- 
book, illustrated, and provided with chapter-sum- 
maries and reference lists. It is published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Merimee's ' Colomba, ' edited by M. Augustin 
Filon, and Saint -Pierre 's 'Paul et Virginie,' edited 
by M. Melchior de Vogiie, are recent additions to 
the ' Classiques Fran^ais ' published in this country 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

'The Useful Life,' further described as 'a crown 
to the simple life,' is a small book published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. It is a compilation 
of extracts from the writings of Swedenborg, and 
has an introduction by Mr. John Bigelow. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish 'A College 
Text Book of Botany,' by Professor George Francis 
Atkinson. This work is an enlargement of the 
author's 'Elementary Botany,' and is a richly-illus- 
trated treatise of more than seven hundred pages. 

Mr. Edward Dowden's volume on Montaigne will 
be published immediately in the 'French Men of 
Letters' series, issued by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 
Further volumes dealing with the foremost French 
writers have been planned, and will appear at inter- 
vals. 

A fourth edition of Mr. George Gary Eggleston's 
'A ICebel's Recollections,' published by the Messrs. 
Putnam, includes an added chapter on 'The Old 
Regime in the Old Dominion.' Otherwise, the work 
is substantially what it was when first published 
over thirty years ago. 

'Constitutional Law in the United States,' by 
Dr. Emlin McClain, is published by Messrs. Long- 
mans, Green, & Co., in their 'American Citizen 
Series. ' It is the work of a trained jurist, and cites 
leading cases for all the important subjects that 
come up for discussion. 

Dr. Elmer Edgar Stoll's monograph on John 
"Webster is a doctoral thesis enlarged, and is 
devoted to a study of the periods of Webster's 
work as determined by his relations to his contem- 
porary dramatists. It is published by Messrs. 
Alfred Mudge & Son, Boston. 

Baedeker's 'London and Its Environs,' in its 
fourteenth revised edition, is imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner for the American market. London 
has changed so greatly during the past few years, 
that this revision of a standard guide-book is more 
acceptable, or rather necessary, than most of its 
fellow-volumes in the Baedeker series. 



'Whistler's Art Dicta and Other Essays,' by 
A. E. G., is a small volume published by Mr. Charlec 
E. Goodapeed. The five papers which it comprises 
are reprinted from various periodicals, and are 
illustrated by numerous facsimiles. Whistler is the 
subject of three of them, and Aubrey Beardsley of 
the remaining two. 

Two important volumes soon to be published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., which have not pre- 
viously been announced, are an authoritative study 
of 'Our Philippine Problem' by Professor H. Par- 
ker Willis, and a collection of 'Lectures on Shakes- 
peare' by Dr. Stopford Brooke. The same firm will 
also issue shortly a new edition, thoroughly revised 
and much enlarged, of Sir Donald Mackenzie Wal- 
lace 's book on Russia. 

'The Higher Life of Chicago,' by Dr. Thomas 
James Riley, is a recent publication of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago Press. It is a study of such matters 
as educational systems and institutions, libraries 
and newspapers, civic associations, social settle- 
ments, trade unions, charitable agencies, religious 
organizations, and women's clubs. As a compen- 
dium of the facts relating to these varied activities, 
it is a book of much value, both for reference and 
for the further stimulation of cultural and altruistic 
endeavor, 

THE SCHILLZK CELEBRATION. 

The one hundredth anniversary of the death of 
Schiller will occur on the ninth of the present 
month, and the occasion will be widely celebrated, 
not only in the land of the poet's birth, but also 
in many others, our own included. Among the ob- 
servances planned for America those to be held in 
Chicago bid fair to be the most noteworthy. Dur- 
ing nearly a year past, preparations have been 
making for a Schiller Festival in this city, the 
enterprise being under the joint direction of the 
American Institute of Germanics and the Schwaben- 
verein of Chicago. Numerous special committees 
have for some time been at work upon the several 
features of the celebration, and the result gives 
promise of being a noteworthy demonstration of 
loyalty to both the personal memory and the objec- 
tive achievements of the noble poet who inspired 
the idealism of Young Germany a hundred years 
ago, and whose example still offers inspiration to 
all generous spirits everywhere who have the cause 
of humanity at heart. One part of this centennial 
celebration occurred about two weeks ago, taking 
the form of an elaborate stage performance of 
'Wilhehn Tell' in the Auditorium at Chicago. 
The remaining events are to occupy a term of four 
days, beginning May 6, and ending with the anni- 
versary of the poet's death. On Saturday, May 6, 
there will be a concert by the Theodore Thomas 
Orchestra and the Apollo Club, having for its prin- 
cipal feature the Ninth Symphony, with the choral 
setting of Schiller's 'An die Freude.' On Sunday, 
there will be a religious service, with choral feat- 
ures, in the morning, and in the afternoon an 
address by Professor Calvin Thomas, also accom- 
panied by the united Mannerchore. Monday will 
be given over to an Academic Conference in the 
Chicago building of the Northwestern University, 
with addresses by the representatives of varions 
universities. The last day of the festival will witness 
appropriate ceremonies at the Schiller monument in 
Lincoln Park, and an evening celebration devoted 
to a picturesque presentation of 'Das Lied von der 
Glocke.' Prize prologues, in both German and 
English, written for the occasion, will be read at 
the public exercises, and a permanent memorial of

the afifair will be provided by the publication of a 
book, reproducing in autograph facsimile the spe- 
cial 'sentiments' or 'appreciations' of something 
like a hundred eminent persons who have re- 
sponded to a request for such contributions. Taken 
altogether, the festival will be a memorable one, 
and the immense German population of Chicago, 
together with the great numbers of those others 
who feel themselves under a deep debt to German 
culture, assures the popular success of the under- 
taking.

A DIRECTORY OF THE AMERICAN

In the issue of The Dial for May 1, 1900, which 
marked the journal's twentieth anniversary, there ap- 
peared a Directory of the American Publishing Trade, 
carefully compiled from information secured especially 
for the purpose from the publishers themselves. This 
Directory proved so useful to our readers and others, that 
it has been thought desirable to reprint it at this time, 
with such revision as the numerous changes in the trade 
during the past five years make necessary. The descriptive 
data here given regarding the leading houses is neces- 
sarily limited and condensed, but aims to cover the follow- 
ing points : Name in full, date of organization, successive 
changes in name with dates of such changes, names of 
present officers or members of company or firm, special 
class of publications, titles of any periodical publications, 
address in full. It is believed that no name of any signifi- 
cance in the legitimate publishing trade of the country has 
been omitted.

THE DIAL. 



[May 1, 



DOOK publishers and book journals are 
■'-^ alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous joiu-nals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. All 
the readers of a book jom-nal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 



T^HE DIAL is more generally consulted 



1 



and depended upon by Librarians in 



making up orders for books than any 
other American critical journal; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other journal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.

Few magazine articles have attracted so much attention as 
Professor N. S. Shaler's on "The Future of Power" in the 
current number of THE INTERNATIONAL QUARTERLY. 
Power, when the world has grown over-populous and used 
all the coal in sight, will be confined chiefly. Professor 
Shaler says, to that of flowing streams and waterfalls, on 
the strength of which many editorial writers have warned 
legislators against selling their birthrights in streams and 
valleys. The Rev. Washington Qladden's article on "The 
Church and Social Problems " has also excited wide comment. 
Another paper of great importance is by Sydney Olivier, ex- 
governor of Jamaica, on the negro problem, under the title 
of "The White Man's Burden at Home." An essay by Mr. 
Okakura-Kakuzo, called "The Cup of Humanity," from his 
forthcoming " Book of Tea," is pronounced by the Evening 
Post, New York, " the most charming magazine article that 
has appeared in a long time." These articles are typical of 
every number of THE INTERNATIONAL QUARTERLY, arti- 
cles of immediate and striking interest and charm. To sub-

THE ENDOWM ENT OF LEARNING. 

The educational world was agreeably sur- 
prised by the recent announcement that Mr. 
Carnegie had found yet a further distinctive 
purpose for his versatile philanthropy, and pos- 
sibly the most urgent and pertinent of all. In 
establishing the Carnegie Institute, the founder 
had set forth the wholesome doctrine that the 
endowment of men was to be considered as of 
greater intrinsic worth than the furtherance of 
projects or the building of institutions. The 
two latter forms of the endowment of learning 
may be said to be firmly sanctioned by our 
philanthropic traditions; they seem to demand 



no defense as to principle, however obviously 
capable of expansion as to practice. There is, 
on the other hand, a curious wariness in regard 
to the spefcific endowment of individuals, a sort 
of suspicion in some quarters that it does not 
quite harmonize with democratic ideals, a still 
less pertinent misgiving in others that it bears 
a flavor of charity. With a growing apprecia- 
tion of the complexity of the conditions requi- 
site for our maintenance of a dignified, not to 
say a commanding, position in the intellectual 
rivalry of nations, such doubts wiU find their 
own solution. The hopeful message of the 
Carnegie Institute was the more distinct recog- 
nition that the most profitable form of 
endeavor was to find the deserving and origi- 
nal type of investigator, and then to^ secure for 
him the conditions most likely to mature for 
the public benefit the issues of his labors. A 
monotonously constant obstacle that stood in 
the way of even a reasonably favorable environ- 
ment was the awkward necessity in which the 
possessor of the favored gifts found himself, 
of earning his living, to say but little of the 
provision with fair prudence against the rainy 
days of incapacity or the gloomy outlook of an 
incomelees old age. To afford some relief to this 
unfortunate condition is the worthy purpose of 
the recent bequest. It is again to endow men 
rather than institutions, to aid *the cause of 
higher education and to remove a source of 
deep and constant anxiety to the poorest-paid 
and yet one of the highest of all professions.' 
The fund will, so far as the institutions that 
share in its benefits are concerned, make pro- 
vision for a pension system for *the least 
rewarded of all professions,' thus enabling those 
who have reached the years when the harness ia 
growing a bit irksome and the pace a little 
tardy to enjoy days' of merited tranquility, and 
— what is equally important — to permit men 
during their prime to devote themselves with 
greater singleness of purpose to the work in 
hand, with less uneasiness as to what the future 
may bring. 

It is rather remarkable that so small a share 
of the great gifts in behalf of education should 
have recognized this central need. The piti- 
ful inadequacy of the professor's salary seems 
to demand as its indispensable compensation 
the provision for a comfortable retirement after 
long-time service. Having abandoned hope of 
even the most modest of competences, the pro- 
fessor should not be required to face senescent 
penury. The need has not been wholly over-

THE DIAIi 



[May 16, 



looked; dt would be possible to enumerate a 
small group of institutions that have adopted 
a pension system, while others have it under 
earnest consideration. In the brief experience 
of the effects of the provision, ceri^in immedi- 
ate benefits are worthy of record: it has 
strengthened the feeling among the members of 
the faculty that they belong for life to the 
university with whose lot they have cast their 
own. This feeling of permanency of adjust- 
ment exercises a wholesome influence upon the 
attitude of the scholar to his work, a content- 
ment of spirit that finds not the least of its 
benefits in the ability to consider with greater 
composure than is now usual, the overtures of 
other institutions. It is because the extent of 
Mr. Carnegie's foundation Avill draw wide 
attention to this greatest defect in our educa- 
tional provisions — a defect that our foreign 
critics have repeatedly pointed out — that it is 
likely to exercise a permanent influence upon 
the administrative measures of all the higher 
institutions of learning. It thus assumes the 
importance of a national contribution to edu- 
cational policy, of a distinctive and comprehen- 
sive recognition of the most persistently over- 
looked' desideratum in the educational situa- 
tion. As such it merits, as it will doubtless 
receive, the enthusiastic endorsement of those 
by whom the welfare of our intellectual con- 
cerns is properly cherished. 

The day has wholly gone by when it was really 
an impropriety to look a gift horse inl the face. 
Indeed the points of favor and defect of the 
offering are as likely to be as carefully consid- 
ered by the donor as by the recipient. At the 
moment, a rather vigorous discussion is going 
on anent a wholly different contribution, argu- 
ing how far it is incumbent upon the benefi- 
ciary to pronounce upon, the methods by which 
the proffered animal was originally acquired. 
The more usual inquiry relates to the special 
fitness of the benefaction to meet the actual 
needs, and without interference with other 
desirable ends. Mr. Carnegie has passed 
through the experience of having a most gen- 
erous offer to a most worthy cause most consid- 
erately declined because of the mature judg- 
ment of those who were to administer the ten- 
dered foundation, that the complications of the 
measure were likely to entail difficulties which 
they were not prepared to face. The wisdom 
of the details of the provisions, as well as the 
possible dangers' which the bequest brings with 
it, are as legitimate points of discussion as were 
these same considerations in the planning of 
the foundation. 

Whenever a very large sum of money is 
given to a cause of this kind, there is the ready 
criticism that it will diminish the natural 
incentive for others to supply similar needs, and 



thus relieve rather than expand the sense of 
civid and philanthropic responsibility. Against 
Mr. Came^e's libraries it is urged that it 
would have been better to have had them locally 
endowed or wljolly provided by the communi- 
ties; in regard to the Carnegie Institute, that it 
would lead universities to shift the burden of 
research to the fund thus provided and with- 
draw funds that might have been available for 
such purpose; and in regard to the present 
grant, that it will postpone the day when uni- 
versities would have of their own accord estab- 
lished pensions for their s«lf-sacrificing profes- 
sors'. This is a complicated issue, for which 
any formula is an impertinence. It is, how- 
ever, interesting to observe that the environ- 
ment of modem civilization is so baffiingly 
complex, and the many-sidedness of human 
concerns so unexpectedly surprising, that there 
is quite as much room for the very opposite 
influence as for the one that at first sight seems 
imminent. One may at all events express the 
hope that Mr. Carnegie's endowment will sup- 
plement existing provisions rather than exon- 
erate universities from the duty of supplying 
pensdons, andj will lead to similar provisions in 
such institutions as do not benefit by the Car- 
negie foundation. The latter consideration will 
presently be shown to have special pertinence. 
And after all, each generation has a nearer 
concern and a profounder insight for the needs 
of the forseeable future than for the more dis- 
tant and dubious perils of a remote posterity. 
In this aspect of things, there are many who 
look forward to a larger amelioration of the 
conditions of learning in America as a conse- 
quence, direct and indirect, of this timely 
bequest, than from any other application of 
beneficent millions. 

The detail likely to arouse strenuous discus- 
sion is easily selected. It is that relating to the 
exclusion of state universities from the benefits 
of the bequest. ,Mr. Carnegie explains that 
inasmuch as such universities ' may prefer that 
their relations shall remain exclusively with the 
state,' he cannot presume to include them. The 
construction of this position is not easy. If it 
is to be taken at its face value, then it may be 
said without hesitation that the conception of 
the function of the state university which it 
seemingly entertains belongs to a bygone and 
not to the present regime. Doubtless there are 
expressions and actions in the past of almost 
all of the state universities that would lend 
color to such an interpretation of their policy; 
but the modem state university is pre-eminent- 
ly a contribution by a given state to the cause 
of higher education in the land ; and state uni- 
versities have been successful in proportion as 
they have acted upon this liberal interpretation 
of their scope and function. ' How much of the

older sentiment is still current, it would take a 
special inquiry to determine; but it would be a 
distinct surprise to leani that state universities 
do prefer that their relations shall remain 
exclusively with the state. Indeed what is most 
striking in regard to the activities of the lead- 
ing state universities is the completeness of 
their parallelism to the purposes, methods, and 
policy of comparable institutions supported by 
private endowment. The rapprochement of 
the two is a notable feature of educational ten- 
dencies. It appears in the confederation of 
American universities bound by the common 
support of graduate work; it appears in every 
movement of a national character in higher edu- 
cational thought. The particular conditions that 
Mr. Carnegie's bequest were especially to relieve, 
obtain in most typical measure in the state uni- 
versities; the under-pa}-ment, the sacrifice of 
personal comfort, the uneasiness, the deep 
interest in the advancement of learning, the 
service often in an uncongenial and unsym- 
pathetic milieu, are on the whole nowhere to 
be found in more typical combination than in 
the service of state institutions. If it be argued 
that the fund set aside would not have been 
adequate for all American universities, and 
that accordingly the principle of selection was 
that of excluding those upon which a duty 
could be rather forcibly urged of providing 
their own pension system, the matter becomes 
more intelligible though less consistent with 
the published statement. Undoubtedly the 
sentiment of responsibility should be rather 
more readily aroused in regard to oflScial than 
in regard to private service. But the present 
temper of legislatures does not seem favorable 
to this type of measure; so that no practical 
relief seems in sight. It will at all events be 
interesting to see what attitude state universi- 
ties will take) towards their exclusion from this 
bequest. The attitude is certain to be a friendly 
one, because of the well proved fact that move- 
ments of this kind, once inaugurated, grow; 
and that the provisions in one group of insti- 
tutions must in the end be met by equal pro- 
visions in others of the same class. It is more 
to the point at present to antagonize the con- 
ception that state universities have any inten- 
tion to be exclusive, or desire to remain in a 
separate class. Many of them have accepted 
extensive or modest private benefactions, and 
some are urging that such benefactions are in- 
deed necessary,- to the extension of interest in 
their mission, upon which the tmiversity spirit 
feeds and grows. 

Mr. Carnegie's gift once more calls deliberate 
attention to the perils of the academic life in 
America. The attractions of the highways to 
other careers advertise themselves, and leave 
the path that leads to the university chair rather 



bare and uninviting. It requires decided de- 
termination, devotion to purpose, and belief in 
ideals to follow it; and defections and unrest 
are becoming' increaaingly common. Still more 
generally is it observed that the class of young 
men who are willing in spite of conspicuous 
discouragement to enter the ranks, does not 
maintain its quality. Mr. Carnegie adds his 
testimony to the fact that ' able men hesitate 
to adopt teaching as a career.' The only 
source of hesitation relevant to the present dis- 
cussion, not by any means the only one worth 
discussing, is that of inadequacy of income. A 
most timely contribution to the matter appears 
in a pleasantiy intimate article in the May is- 
sue of ' The Atlantic Monthly,' setting forth un- 
der the caption * What Should College Profes- 
sors Be Paid?' an itemized account of actual 
expenses for nine years of a teacher in one of 
the larger American universities. The result is 
that this self-sacrificing individual has actually 
been required to spend nearly double his aver- 
age income from the university for living ex- 
penses, and so has paid some $1400.00 annually 
for the privilege of teaching. What this means, 
when interpreted for the institutions as a whole, 
and! for the universities throughout the land, is 
nothing less than the recognition of the fact 
that the actual supporters of our institutions of 
higher education hiave not been either the mil- 
lionaires or the legislatures but the professors 
themselves. The writer in the ' Atlantic ' 
concludes that an advance of about sixty per 
cent would be needed to supply the basis for 
the necessities of life to a man with an eco- 
nomic temperament, in the social status of the 
professor; which fact, if accepted, may quite 
well be stated by saying that for many years 
professors have been contributing the missing 
sixty per cent of their salaries to the support of 
the institutions for whose benefit their services 
were rendered. And in the aggregate this 
would constitute a sum fairly comparable in 
some cases, if not in most, with the income from 
other sources. 

In this aspect of things the Carnegie founda- 
tion appears as a single but important step in 
the encouragement of the academic life through 
the removal of its present disadvantages. The 
question thus comes to the front whether a still 
more pointed remedy would not have been 
equally or even more effective, in other words 
some direct incentive for the provision of ade- 
quate incomes. The conditional gift is one that 
present-day philanthropists find convenient to 
their purposes of inspiring rather than of dead- 
ening endeavor. If the income from such a 
magnificent sum as Mr. Carnegie has devoted 
to the endowment of learning were offered to 
deserving universities upon condition that the 
authorities provide a certain minimum but ade- 



346

quate income for their professors, it is not 
whollyi idle to hope that the higher education 
would be as decidedly benefited as by the pro- 
vision of pensions; and the effect of the infusion 
of new life would have been more immediately 
and outwardly visible. Perhaps both plans are 
worth a trial ; and the untried method of stim- 
idation may serve as the suggestion for further 
experimentation. Important as are ways and 
means of alleviating distress, the relief of the 
unfortunate condition is far more important 
than the manner thereof. To Mr. Carnegie be- 
longs the honor of the first adequate recognition 
of the importance of the evil which he has at- 
tempted to relieve by a contribution that indi- 
cates that such a step is coordinate in value 
with the endowment of research or the equip- 
ment of instruction. Joseph Jastrow. 



THE BASIS OF LITERATURE. 



When an entomologist finds a new species of 
insect, he writes a description of it, which is 
iorthwith published in a technical journal. 
People do not read such descriptions, unless 
they themselves have an insect which they think 
may be the same. After a careful comparison 
between the printed words and the specimen 
in hand, it may appear that one has the species 
described, and immediately the words live 
again as they did in the mind of the original 
describer. More than this, however, the pub- 
lished account, viewed in the light of its mani- 
fest meaning, almost always contributes some- 
thing new to the stock of ideas of the person 
using it. 

With all literature, apparently, the same 
thing happens. There has to be a common 
factor, X, in the minds of writer and reader, 
which is the carrier of an uncommon factor, 
y. Let it be the test of literature that it con- 
tains both X and y. 

Some very successful writings, in a commer- 
cial sense, owe their vogue to the fact that they 
reflect the minds of the readers. They gratify 
the common taste for regarding one's own 
image. Such, evidently, are not literature in 
our sense; the reaction, x + x, is a perfectly 
sterile one. 

Other writings, rich in y, carry no x for most 
readers. It is notorious that the first readers 
of several notable works found no x therein at 
all, and were ready to reject them altogether. 
They were like descriptions of an insect no 
specimen of which was known to later students. 
It is possible that there now exist works of 
this character, useless to us, but veritable mines 
of wealth to those who have the key — the 
common character which we call x. In science 



an interesting and suggestive case has lately 
come to light. One Gregor Mendel, an Aus- 
trian priest, published in 1865 a paper on 
heredity, as illustrated by experiments in breed- 
ing plants. This paper was ignored until 1900, 
but to-day it is regarded as one of the most 
important of all scientific writings. A better- 
known and equally illustrative case is that of 
Sprengel and his writings on insects and flow- 
ers, — laughed at in his day, but regarded as 
the work of a genius since Darwin showed us 
where to find the x. 

Could there be a perfectly sterile y, carrying 
no x for any one ? It is thinkable, but scarcely 
believable. Picture the man condemned as a 
lunatic or crank, carrying nevertheless the 
greatest message to manlcind, which no man, 
now or hereafter, could ever understand. For- 
tunate it is, that it is possible to address pos- 
terity, so that a voice falling to-day on deaf 
ears may echo hereafter with pregnant mean- 
ing. 

Although it is hard to believe that any 
y-bearing literature, if duly preserved, will 
always remain sterile, there is the question of 
its preservation. Before the days of printed 
books many a good idea must have gone down 
the wind unheeded. In these days of over 
many books, it is as likely to be lost in the very 
chaos of writing, voiceless like the man who 
cries against the crowd. And the worst of it 
is, we are by the nature of the case unable to 
prevent it. 

Can fruitful literature ever cease to be so? 
As it is assimilated, the y is gradually converted 
into X, and in the simpler cases no residue at 
length remains. Whatever was there is now 
fully possessed by the reader, and he may not 
obtain fresh inspiration from that source. Thus 
some scientific papers, y-ivl\ in their day, have 
now no more than historic interest. It is the 
distinction- of really great literature that it 
never loses its ^/-quality; the more it is used 
up, the more seems to flow from it, as from a 
perennial spring. 

If the superiority of the ancient Greeks was 
as great as Galton has maintained, it is think- 
able that their like may never again arise; and 
thus there might be a belated literature, which 
would appeal only to those whom it could never 
reach. Its cr-ness would be extinct before it 
was born. One could, I think, select instances 
of writers who seemed to themselves to write 
for the past rather than for the present or 
future. 

The best literature, evidently, is that which 
carries a maximum of y, with enough x to make 
the former fruitful. Style is clearly an x 
character simply, hence it cannot be the end 
of literature. Nevertheless, it is of the utmost 



1905.J 



THE DIAL, 



347 



value, being the means whereby x-ness is given 
to the most y-some thoughts, as is very well 
seen in the ease of William James, who can 
make even psychology fascinating to ordinary 
readers. On the other hand, y-less style is bar- 
ren, at best tickling the intellectual palate. 

It is useless to expect real literature to grow 
out of anything but mental travail. All litera- 
ture is propaganda; it carries its message as 
from teacher to student, the teacher himself 
being also a student. It cannot be impartial, 
whether it relates to a woman's face or the 
theory of evolution. It must not be afraid of 
giving offense; indeed, it is the knight-errantry 
of the mind. What literature may this coun- 
try and day produce? Ask, rather, what 
advance is it making in thought or deed, what 
are its aims, what tomorrow would it have? 
For literature is prophecy; the first fruit of 
the coming change, the very birth of the 
y-child for whom the inheritance is waiting. 
Will you say, against this, that the highest 
literature has often dealt with the oldest 
themes, and with matters of small import? 
What is it to the world that Romeo loved 
Juliet? Truly, nothing at all, baldly postu- 
lated; but it is the privilege of the highest 
genius, and that only, to really illuminate, 
y-wise, the events of every human life. One 
does not need to possess much talent to add 
something to the subject of beetles, but to 
enrich the thought of mankind on a subject of 
universal consideration, — that is as difficult 
as it is admirable. 

Perhaps I am partial to science; but I ven- 
ture to claim that most scientific writings, dry- 
as-dust if you please, are more genuinely liter- 
ature than much of what is ordinarily put out 
as such. They contain y-elements; not, per- 
haps, of a very distinguished kind, but real in 
their way. There is no reason why science 
should not aspire to be the basis of a very high 
type of literature, but this must be the product 
of genius, here as elsewhere. History is as 
scientific as natural-history, or should be, and 
it has long been recognized as a field for liter- 
ary effort. Euskin did not lose his eloquence 
when he took to sociology, and it would be diffi- 
cult to find any modem American writings 
worthier to be called literature than those of 
William James. In the belief that science has 
a strong and special message for this and com- 
ing generations, I would urge that new attempts 
shoidd be made to give it the ^-quality which 
may make it available literature to the people, 
without reducing it to the meaningless level of 
ordinary popular scientific writings. To this 
task, the best abilities may fittingly be dedi- 
cated; but courage and perseverance are as 
necessary as literary skill.

Southern Jutfe ts "Wak Time.* 



Mary BoyMn Chesnut was the wife of one 
of the most prominent of the ante-bellum south- 
em leaders. Her relatives were all of the 
wealthy slaveholding class — the class that, 
according to the popular histories, precipitated 
the southern people into secession and war for 
the sake of slavery. The published extracts from 
Mrs. Chesnut's diary ought to do much to cor- 
rect some false impressions that most people, 
southern as well as northern, now have of the 
old southern regime. The entries in the journal 
cover a period of four years, from 1861 to 1865. 
In its entirety the diary filled forty-eight small 
manuscript volumes; but for the present pur- 
pose the editors have condensed it by omitting 
matter of purely local interest, and they have 
added a sketch of the author and some explan- 
atory notes in the text. 

Written from day to day, these pages reflect 
the spirit of the times better, perhaps, than 
any other account that we have. AU was grist 
that came to this mill. There are jokes, war 
anecdotes, stories of love and death, notes of 
conversations heard on the cars, in the streets, 
in ballroom, hospital, and dressing room, from 
women, soldiers, statesmen, spies, and negroes, 
descriptions of economic, social, and military 
conditions^ and of Confederate politics. Nearly 
every noted man or woman of the Confederacy 
contributes a conversation or an opinion, which 
Mrs. Chesnut records and comments upon. It 
was not a private journal, but lay open upon the 
parlor table and was read by any friend who 
cared to see what had been written. The style 
is crisp and bright, and the tone frank and 
good tempered. *I praise whom I love and 
abuse whom I hate,' says Mrs. Chesnut, but 
there is little abuse in her pages. It is inter- 
esting to note the difference between South 
Carolina and Virginia in regard to social posi- 
tion. * Until we came here [Richmond] we had 
never heard of our social position,' Mrs. Ches- 
nut wrote ; ' we do not know how to be rude ta 
people who call. To talk of social position 
seems vulgar. Down our way that sort of thing 
was settled one way or another beyond a per- 
adventure, like the earth and sky. We never 
gave it a thought. We talked to whom we 
pleased, and if they were not comme il faut, 
we were ever so much more polite to the poor 
things.'

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



As the conunents of one in closest touch 
with political affairs and possessing the confi- 
dence of the leading Confederates, Mrs. Ches- 
nut's remarks upon secession are most inter- 
esting. Certainly nearly all of the people whom 
she knew were loath to secede, — the men to 
leave high positions, the women to give up 
social prestige. If we may trust her judgment, 
the southern leaders were slow to secede and 
somewhat despondent as to the future. The 
people, however, were enthusiastic, though 
^complaining bitterly of slow and lukewarm 
public leaders.^ President Davis was denounced 
in 1861 as ' no seceder,'^ and in 1863 some one 
accused him of 'not being out of the Union 
yet.' ' Lord ! how he must have hated to do 
it,' is the comment of the diarist when Judge 
Campbell resigned and came south. After the 
Confederacy was formed the general desire was 
for peace, and many hoped for re-union. When 
Mrs. Chesnut heard the cannonade at Sumter, 
she says, ' I prayed as I never prayed before.' 
The future seemed gloomy. Davis told her to 
be ready for a long war; Trescott and Stephens 
had little hope of success; the army officers 
dbclared that the North was overwhelmingly 
superior in resources; and, in 1862, Yancey 
came home from England and reported ' not 
one jot of hope.' Decidedly the chieftains 
dampened enthusiasm, but the average people 
were sanguine. 

There was complaint that half-hearted men 
had secured the high places, and intrigue and 
jealousy were rife in Montgomery and Eich- 
mond as in Washington. Mason and Yancey 
were criticised as not being the proper persons 
to send abroad. The enemies of Davis seemed 
willing to ruin the cause in order to injure him. 
Spies were allowed to come and go almost with- 
out check, and Congress and the newspapers 
could keep no secrets. So run the comments. 
Mrs. Chesnut has small respect for the enemies 
of Davis and their 'virulent nonsense,' and 
when the end draws near she declares that ' the 
soldiers have done their duty' but 'the Con- 
federacy has been done to death by the politi- 
cians.' The stubbornness of Davis and John- 
eon, the slowness of Longstreet, the rashness of 
Hood, — all come in for keen criticism. But 
for the Lees, father and sons, there is nothing 
but admiration. General Lee is to her ' the 
very first man in all the world,' ' so cold, quiet, 
and grand,' and she notes that at the height of 
his fame he wished only for a Virginia farm 
with fresh cream and ' unlimited fried chicken.' 
Of his son, when he spoke well of General But- 
ler, she remarks 'the Lees are men enough to 
speak the truth of friend or enemy, fearing not 
the consequences.' An observation worth men- 
tioning was that the political and military lead- 



ers of the Confederacy were Scotch and Scotch- 
Irish, and not of the planting class, — 'our 
planters are nice fellows, but slow to move.' 
This daughter of South Carolina thinks that 
the southerners of the East bore privation and 
discipline better than those of the West. 

The negroes knew very well what the war 
was about, and some of the southern people 
were in fear of slave uprisings. All during the 
war Mrs. Chesnut watched the blacks closely. 
She states that while some of them were ' furi- 
ously patriotic ' and wanted to enlist and fight 
for their masters, the great majority were pro- 
foundly indifferent, 'utterly apathetic' as late 
as 1865, showing the influence of the war spirit, 
only in ' increased diligence and absolute 
silence.' The only sign of feeling was dis- 
played by the better class of house servants, 
some of whom assumed stately airs, and ' con- 
trived to keep from speaking to us,' though 
attentive to duties. The planters found great 
difficulty in supporting their negroes while no 
cotton was being sold and prices of supplies 
were high. Some planters were ruined by this 
expense. When the end came there was joy at 
freedom among the negroes, yet most of them 
went on plowing and hoeing as usual. The 
disorder came later. 

Slavery, it has been said, was the corner- 
stone of the Confederacy. So it was, as the non- 
slaveholders and the lesser slaveholders and the 
poorer classes saw it. But Mirs. Chesnut's diarj' 
bears repeated evidence that to the hereditary 
slaveholders the institution had become an 
intolerable burden and responsibility, and to 
these emancipation came as a relief. 

It is on the subject of negroes and slavery 
that Mrs. Chesnut's diary will prove most valu- 
able to historians, but the general reader will 
be chiefly interested in the accounts of the 
home life of the beleaguered people. There 
was feasting and dancing in the early 
days of the war, ' starvation parties ' and 
dancing during the latter part, and love- 
making and marriages all the time. There 
were brides dressed in coarse Confederate 
gray, bridesmaids in black, and guests in ' four 
year old finery.' A new book was ' a pleasing 
incident in this life of monotonous misery.' 
The home people were seeking distraction from 
sorrow. ' Hope and f eai: are both gone and it 
is distraction or death. . . If it would do 
any good we would be sad enough.' ' An open 
grave with piles of red earth thrown on one 
side; that is the only future I see.' As the 
years wore on, and the death roll of fathers, 
sons, husbands, and sweethearts grew longer, 
women died silently of grief. ' Our best and 
bravest are under the sod,' writes Mrs. Chesnut, 
' we are hard as stones ; we sit unmoved and

Reason ix Humax Conduct.* 

Professor Santayana of Harvard University 
has the unusual gift of being able to make lit- 
erature out of philosophy, without apparently 
finding it necessary to dilute the latter in the 
process. He has already deserved well of both 
the philosophical and the general public, but 
his projected work on ' The Life of Eeason ' is 
by far the most elaborate and important enter- 
prise that he has yet attempted. Indeed it 
promises to constitute in some ways one of the 
distinctive contributions to philosophy of the 
last few decades. It is, to begin with, more 
encyclopaedic in its scope than anything of the 
kind recently issued. The five volumes that 
are proposed will deal respectively with Reason 
in Common Sense, Reason in Society, Reason 
in Religion, Reason in Art, and Reason in 
Science; of these the first two have already 
appeared. Furthermore, the work may be 
regarded as the first attempt to give any sys- 
tematic expression to that new group of ten- 
dencies which, under the name of Pragmatism, 
or Humanism, is causing a ferment in the 
philosophical world at the present time. The 
movement has been so confused and groping 
hitherto, that any effort to give greater pre- 
cision to its outlines is to be welcomed. But to 
Professor Santayana's work is due not merely 
the commendation that belongs to a pioneer 
attempt ; its own positive quality is so good that 
it can afford to stand on its inherent merits. 
And while it is too early to predict whether or 
not it will be accepted generally by the Prag- 
matists as a satisfactory presentation of their 
apparently somewhat divergent views, it can- 
not fail to influence in a marked way the future 
course of discussion. 

It is not to be supposed that the fuU burden 
of Professor Santayana's thought wiU yield 
itself easily to the casual reader. It is in parts, 
especially in the first volume, hard reading, as 
any fundamental inquiry must be ; and the difl&- 
culty is not greatly lessened (one suspects that 
it may perhaps even be increased a little in 
places) by the literary charm and poetic sug- 
gestion of the style. Nevertheless the qualities 
that lie on the surface will make these volumes 
attractive to almost any one who cares for vital 
and penetrating criticism applied to hum an life. 

• The Ltfe of Reason*. Or, The Phases of Human 
Progress. By George Santayana. Volume I., Introduction 
and Reason in Common Sense. Volume II., Reason in So- 
ciety. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



The statement that the work is encyclopaedic in 
the nature of its treatment should not suggest 
anything of the ponderousness that usually goes 
along with a philosophical survey of human 
reason. These attractive little volumes suggest 
the literary essayist rather than the systematic 
philosopher. And indeed they may be looked 
at as a series of connected essays, in which the 
salient aspects of experience stsuid out in relief, 
treated in a suggestive rather than an exhaust- 
ive way, and made the centre of a play of 
illujninating and sometimes brilliant comment, 
from a mind keen, original, and in possession 
of a single clearly-defined and fruitful point of 
view. Therefore whether one accepts, or even 
wholly understands, the large doctrine of the 
work, he will be likely to enjoy the many rela- 
tively independent discussions of detail scat- 
tered through its pages. The sustained fresh- 
ness of the treatment is rather remarkable. Of 
course there is much that is not new ; but almost 
invariably the treatment escapes any suspicion 
of the stale and commonplace. This is due in 
part to the closeness of the touch that is kept 
with concrete and first hand experience, and in 
part it is to be put to the credit of the writer's 
literary gift, — if indeed the two are not in a 
measure one. Even in the more abstruse dis- 
cussions, we are made constantly aware that we 
have to do with the interpretation of actual 
conscious experiences, and furthermore that 
these are not intellectual contents simply, but 
are also in every case the expression of subtle 
emotional reactions toward life. And Professor 
Santayana is notably successful in the very 
diflScult task of making language suggest these 
most elusive and baffling implications of experi- 
ence. 

For one, therefore, who is willing also to 
think, the work is essentially readable through- 
out. It is full of keen insight wedded to apt 
expression. Take these sentences for example : 
' Fanaticism coi^ists in redoubling your effort 
when you have forgotten your aim.' ' There is 
nothing sweeter than to be s}Tnpathized with, 
while nothing requires a rarer intellectual hero- 
ism than the willingness to see one's equation 
written out.' ' Those who cannot remember the 
past are condemned to repeat it.' ' Activity does 
not consist in velocity of change, but in con- 
stancy of purpose.' * There is nothing cheaper 
than idealism. It can be had by merely not 
observing the ineptitude of our chance preju- 
dices, and by declaring that the first rhymes 
that have struck our ear are the eternal and 
necessar\' harmonies of the world.' And the 
description of metaph3'sics as the ' love affairs 
of the understanding.' Most of the especially 
felicitous passages, however, are too long to 
quote here.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



Any brief summary of Professor Santayana's 
philosophical doctrine must needs be bald and 
inadequate, giving but a slight idea of its sug- 
gestiven^s or of the importance of the ques- 
tions that it raises. Eeason is described 
as vital impulse modified by reflection and veer- 
ing in sympathy with judgments pronounced on 
the past. It involves two sides, therefore, 
either of which may exist in relative indepen- 
dence of the other. Underlying it as its ulti- 
mate presupposition are the dark, irrational 
depths of blind feeling and impulse. But to 
bring out of this anything that we can call 
experience or progress, anything whatever that 
has consicious meaning or value, it is necessary 
that brute sense existence should get an ideal 
dimension. Feelings must be attached to ideas ; 
instincts must become in some degree conscious 
of their ends. So, again, the life of ideas, of 
imagination, may exist parasitically in a man, 
hardly touching his action or environment. A 
dream is always simmering below the conven- 
tional surface of speech and reflection, and 
there may well be intense consciousness in the 
total absence of rationality. Such consciousness 
is suggested in dreams and in madness, and 
for all we know it may be found in tlie depths 
of universal nature. Eeason and humanity 
begin with the union of instinct and ideation, 
when instinct becomes enlightened, establishes 
values in its objects, and is turned from a pro- 
cess into an art, while at the same time con- 
sciousness becomes practical and cognitive, 
beginning to contain some symbol or record of 
the coordinate realities among which it arises. 
The Life of Eeason is the happy marriage of 
two elements, impulse and ideation, which if 
wholly divorced would reduce man to a brute 
or to a maniac. The rational animal is gener- 
ated by the union of these two monsters. He is 
constituted by ideas that have ceased to be 
visionary and actions that have ceased to be 
vain. 

Ideals are thus the very stuff of rational life. 
The physical world itself is nothing but an 
instrument to explain sensations and their order, 
an ideal term used to mark, and as it were to 
justify, the adhesion in space and recurrence 
in time of recognizable groups of sensations. 
No doubt there is some ambiguity in calling this 
ideal, since we ordinarily set it off from ideals 
in the narrower sense as constituting the natural 
conditions from which ideals spring and on 
which they depend; still the origin of both is 
the same in principle. Such conditions have 
already been formulated in the constructions of 
a mechanical science. These are therefore to be 
accepted by philosophy franldy, as the neces- 
sary presuppositions to be recognized in the 
effort to satisfy our preferences in that world 
of values which is the dwelling place of relig- 



ion and art and the other spiritual interests of 
man. 

While truth certainly exists, then, if existence 
be not too mean an attribute for that eternal 
realm that is tenanted by ideals, it is repugnant 
to physical or psychical bfcing. Truth means 
not sensible fact, but valid ideation, verified 
hypothesis, and inevitable and stable inference. 
Eeason is no active force, but merely a method 
by which objects of desire are compared in 
reflection. For the impelling and directive 
force we must needs fall back upon the magical 
involuntary nature of life; it is subterranean, 
deep beneath the realm of ideas and conscious 
intent. Attention simply registers, and watches 
the images bubbling up in tihie living mind and 
the processes evolving there. Consciousness is 
a sort of ritual solemnizing, by prayer, jubila- 
tion, or mourning, the chief episodes in the 
body's fortunes. Spirit is thus useless, being the 
end of things; but it is not vain, since it alone 
rescues all else from vanity, by giving to it 
whatever of value it possesses. 

The aim of philosophy is of course not to 
manufacture ideals, but to interpret them. The 
problem is to imite a trustworthy conception of 
the conditions under which man lives with an 
adequate conception of his ideal interests. There 
are two kinds of mistakes that we may make, as 
has been implied already. The scientific radical 
is BO proud of having got rid of the obsolete 
machinery of past ideals that he remains 
entangled in the colossal error that the ideal 
itself is something adventitious and unmeaning, 
not having a soil in mortal life or a possible 
fulfillment there. The mistakes to which the 
idealist is inclined are of an opposite sort. He 
may forget that he is dealing with the product 
of the poetic imagination, and may try to 
materialize it, to turn it, as popular religion 
does, into a statement of existence, which he 
substitutes for the natural world out of which 
it springs. Or he may in another way lose 
sight of the connection between the ideal and 
the real, and deny or frown upon the natural 
conditions with reference to which alone the 
ideal has meaning. For what are ideals about, 
what do they idealize, except natural existence 
and natural passions ? The soul is but the voice 
of the body's interests. Every phase of the 
ideal world emanates from the natural and 
loudly proclaims its origin by the interest it 
takes in natural existence, of which it gives a 
rational interpretation. To adjust all demands 
to one ideal and adjust that ideal to its natural 
conditions, — this is the * steadfast art of liv- 
ing,' the Life of Eeason. 

With such a conception as this for his start- 
ing point. Professor Santayana has of nece^ity 
the task set for him to render his general prin- 
ciples in terms of the concrete facts of human

life ; and to this the remaining four volumes — 
of which ' Eeason in Society " is the first — are 
to be devoted. While * E^son in Society ' is 
much more easily digested by the reader without 
a technical philosophical training than the 
introductory volume, it is a question whether it 
quite fulfils the promise of its predecessor. Sev- 
eral of the chapters in the first book are really 
notable contributions to speculative thought. 
' Eeason in Society ' somehow strikes one as less 
forcible and well-rounded, less adequate to the 
theme. Nevertheless, it is a thoroughly inter- 
esting book. The first chapter — on Love — 
is possibly the most characteristic, and lends 
itself more readily to the author's peculiar gifts. 
Then follow chapters on The Family, on Indus- 
try, Government and War, The Aristocratic 
Ideal, Democracy, Free Society, Patriotism, and 
Ideal Society. On all these subjects something 
clear-cut and interesting is said; and though 
the treatment is perhaps marked by a certain 
not wholly pleasant character of aloofness and 
a failure in full-blooded himian sympathy, its 
keen analysis and criticism of social ideals is 
bracing and salutary, in view of the dangerous 
power that a sentimental conventionalism has 
to obscure our recc^ition of social facts as 
they really are. 

Nevertheless one may read and admire, and 
still not be convinced that such a Positivism 
as these volumes represent is a final philo- 
sophical creed. It is acutely reasoned, with 
clear consciousness of the issues involved; and 
if true it would vastly simplify the problems of 
philosophy. But will these admit of such a 
simplification? There may be more to be said 
than the author will allow against reducing the 
objects of our spiritual experience without 
remainder to the ideal, as opposed to so-called 
real, existence. The question turns partly upon 
the conclusiveness of certain philosophical rea- 
sonings, partiy on our estimates of values; and 
this is not the place to consider either. But 
one may be permitted to doubt whether the 
embodiment in terms of a real existence which 
(somewhat inconsequentially, it might appear) 
is allowed its right when the conception of 
otiier human selves is concerned, is after all to 
be ruled out so sharply in the case of God and 
Nature. And once admitted into the scheme 
of things at all, one may still more seriously 
question whether a right human attitude wiU 
allow the thoroughgoing subordination of per- 
sons to ideals which Professor Santayana's 
* Eeason in Society' throughout involves. At 
least this will seem to some readers a funda- 
mental weakness of the book, however difficult 
it might be found to establish a contrary creed.

iTAT.iAx By- Ways.* 



Of the many Americans who flock to Italy 
each year, the very large majority stick to what 
has been called the American trail of travel, 
visiting Naples, Eome, Florence, Siena, Venice, 
Milan, with perhaps a glimpse of the Umbrian 
towns of Assisi and Perugia, or Orvieto by the 
way. Comparatively few leave the beaten paths to 
explore the fascinating country villages, to fol- 
low up the course of some of the small streams, 
or to climb on foot or on donkey-back the steep 
hills to some little settlement perched forever 
beyond the approach of any wagon track, and 
there to stop long enough to see something of 
the life lived by its quaint people. Yet he 
who does not do this, who does not penetrate 
into the heaths and make the acquaintance 
of the Italians on their native heath, never 
really knows Italy. The two-months tourist on 
his return discourses eloquently indeed on Ital- 
ian life and character, based upon an acquaint- 
ance with shop-keepers, hotel-clerks, cabmen, 
and beggars. His generalizations are about as 
valuable as one that should be made in America 
from an exclusive acquaintance with our cor- 
responding classes, by some one who had never 
met an educated American, who had never 
been inside an American home, and who under- 
stood only enough of our language to count 
our money and discuss the weather. 

As a matter of fact, Italy does not wear her 
heart on her sleeve, even for those who are 
most alive to her charms. To enter into a real 
comprehension of her life requires a very long 
residence. The customs, the occupations, and 
the social conditions that lie at the base of 
Italian civilization are so different from our 
own as to be often really puzzUng. Mrs, Janet 
Eoss, an Englishwoman living for thirty-five 
years in Florence or its neighborhood, has writ- 
ten many charming books helpful to an under- 
standing of Italy and now offers us a collection 
of short articles under the general title * Old 
Florence and Modem Tuscany.' There are 
fifteen papers in aU, and most of them have 
had previous publication in the English maga- 
zines. They deal with such fascinating sub- 
jects as Popular Songs in Tuscany, Vintaging 
in Tuscany, Oil-Making, Virgil and Agricul- 
ture, Land Tenure, etc. The general impres- 
sion one gets from the book is the same that 
one gets from travel in the country itself, — 
the happiness of the contadino class, amid con-

ditions that to us seem full of hardship. The 
paternal system known as mezzeria or half- 
and-half land-tenure, prevails, based on an 
equal division between landowner and peasant 
of everything the soil produces. Dating back 
tQ the palmy days of the Roman Eepublic and 
having undergone many vicissitudes, it still 
exists in spite of occasional efforts to abolish 
it. That Italy has no wish to copy our own 
conditions is shown by the argument of Signor 
Lambruschini, quoted by Mrs. Eoss. 

'If you abolish mezzeria, all those families who, 
though poor, have a roof they can call their own, a 
field they can call theirs, and a master they love 
and bless; who, toiling and watching under rain and 
sun, hope and pray to God for abundant crops for 
themselves and for their master, will for the first 
time feel the pangs of envy and hatred, the shame 
and despair of being forced to beg, an^ to wait for 
work. At the same time we shall learn to dread 
meetings and strikes such as occur in France and 
England, the destruction of agricultural machinery, 
the burning of ricks, barefaced robbery and — as 
the last and miserable remedy — the poor-tax.' 

Like all human institutions, however, mezzeria 
has two sides. Over against the community of 
interest it establishes between proprietor and 
peasant, may be set the fact that it is a bar 
to agricultural progress, but the old-established 
custom of helping the workers to tide over a 
bad year bears its fruits, and socialism has no 
followers among the contadini. 

Less practical, but more picturesque and 
poetic, than Mrs. Boss's book is the work 
entitled 'The Medici Balls,' written by two 
American women who also have known 
Italy as residents, and not as mere tour- 
ists. The title is a bit far-fetched; hav- 
ing made seven little journeys in Tuscany and 
' in all their travels, even in lanes and modest 
farm houses, having found themselves under 
the aegis of the powerful banker-princes of 
Florence,' they call their account of these seven 
journeys ' The Medici Balls,' from the seven 
balls on the shield as worn by Piero de' Medici 
when the Medicean supremacy was at its height. 
The places visited are The Mugello, Prato, 
Ohianti and the Impruneta, Lucca, Pistoja, the 
Hills of Brancoli, and Barga. It is the illus- 
trations quite as much as the text that make 
the charm of this book. Nearly all of these 
pictures, numbering more than one hundred, 
are quite new, being taken by the travellers' 
own kodak. Olive orchards and vineyards and 
trellised vines, the large, white, violet-eyed Tiis- 
can oxen driven by kindly-faced peasants; 
walled towns, towers, and fortresses ; peasants 
and priests faring along winding lanes; straw- 
plaiters, with busy fingers weaving in front 
of cottage doors, — all those scenes that one 
sees continually in Italy and nowhere else in 



the world, — ^making a charming portfolio of 
studies to be enjoyed by all, but most by those 
Avho can fill in the pictures by memory of the 
golden touch of sun and color and fragrance 
with which the real Italy caresses all. 

Like the two pleasant volumes just noticed, 
Mrs. Edith Wharton's ' Italian Backgrounds ' 
is a collection of impressions and essays about 
Italy. But while the others are books merely, 
this is literature. Through this travellei^s 
story runs a fine thread of scholarship, of 
savoir fairs, of cosmopolitanism, not easily to 
be matched in travel-literature. The reader's 
pulse quickens with an artistic pleasure such as 
might be aroused by a novel by Thackeray or 
George Eliot, or an essay by Matthew Arnold 
or Lowell. The book has what we call distinc- 
tion of style, as impossible to resist as to define. 

Whither Mrs. Wharton goes, and what are the 
subjects of her chapters, it is not important to 
mention. Any particular geography is not the 
point in question when the guide is one so 
steeped in the spirit of the 'land in which any- 
thing may happen save the dull, the obvious, and 
the expected.' If in Mrs. ^^^larton's pages we do 
not see Italy steadily and see it whole, we do 
a better thing, — we trust ourselves to a stream 
of impressions and memories that is much more 
inspiring than any mere observation. Indeed, 
had Mrs. Wharton been practical and well- 
advised, some of her most delightful experi- 
ences would have been lacking. For example, 
everyone would recommend for August an 
Alpine village rather than an Italian journey; 
at Spliigen is not the air pure and fresh and 
cool? But Spliigen was guilty of the unforgiv- 
able offence of\ being too near Italy. 
'One can forgive a place three thousand miles from 
Italy for not being Italian; but that a village on 
the very border should remain stolidly, immovably 
Swiss was a constant source of exasperation. Even 
the landscape had neglected its opportunities. . 
Was it better to be cool and look at a waterfall, 
or be hot and look at St. Mark's? Was it better to 
walk on gentians or on mosaic, to smell fir-needles 
or incense? Was it, in short, ever well to be else- 
where when one might be in Italy?' 

Everyone who has invented excuses for going to 
Italy, or for postponing departure from it, will 
foresee what happened. 

'We tried to quell the rising madness by interro- 
gating the travellers. Was it very hot on the lakes 
and in Milan? "Terribly," they answered, and 
mopped their brows. "Unimaginative idiots!" we 
grumbled, and forebore to question the next batch. 
Of course it was hot there — but what of that! 
Gradually we began to picture our sensa- 
tions should we take seats in the diligence on its 
return journey. From that moment we were lost 
. The two diligences have the silent square 
to themselves. There they stand, side by side in 
dusty slumber, till the morning cow-bells wake them 
to departure. One goes back to Thusis; to the

region of good hotels, pure air and scenic platitudes. 
It may go empty for all we care. But the other 
. the other wakes from its Alpine sleep to 
climb the cold pass at sunrise and descend by hot 
windings into the land where the church steeples 
turn into campaniU, where the vine, breaking from 
perpendicular bondage, flings a liberated embrace 
about the mulberries, and far off, beyond the plain, 
the mirage of domes and spires, of painted walls 
and sculptured altars, beckons across the dustiest 
tracts of memory. In that diligence our seats are 
taken. ' 

To make any new artistic discovery in 
Italy at this late day, would seem hardly 
likely. But such was Mrs. Wharton's joyful 
experience. At San Yivaldo, a secluded mon- 
astery somewhat difficult of access, she found a 
series of pictures representing the Via Crucis, 
having only a local fame but usually ascribed 
to Gk)nnelli of the seventeenth century. This 
late origin, Mrs. Wharton's keen sense for the 
characteristics of the different periods of Ital- 
ian art rejected at once. The treatment was 
seen to be that of an artist trained in an earlier 
tradition. The careful modelling of the hands, 
the quiet grouping, free from effort and agita- 
tion, the simple draperies, the devotional 
expression of the faces, all pointed to the latter 
p^ of the fifteenth century. Expert testi- 
mony has since confirmed the author's opinion 
at every point, and a beautiful photogravure of 
a group from *The Crucifixion,' placed as a 
frontispiece to this volume, enables the reader 
to judge for himself. How many such ' finds ' 
may yet await in Italian by-ways, who shall 
say? Certain it is that our new faculty for 
the differentiation of styles in painting is rapidly 
doing away with our unquestioned allegiance to 
authority and pushing many of the old attribu- 
tions to the wall. 

The temptation to quote from a book of such 
fine flavor as this of Mrs. Wharton's is great 
but must be resisted. The delicate and sym- 
pathetic drawings made by Mr. E. C. Peixotto 
are worthy illustrations of the text. Although 
it is true, as Mrs. Wharton says, that * there 
is no short cut to an intimacy with Italy,' still a 
book like her own is something for which to be 
grateful as an alluring, though roundabout,

PlOXEERS OF WESTEKX EXPLORATIOX.* 

In her volume entitled * Pathfinders of the 
West* Miss Agnes Laut, one of that brilliant 
little group of Canadians who are so creditably 
upholding the intellectual reputation of their 
country in Xew York, adds another and a very 
delightful volume to the growing literature of 
early western exploration. This is the story 

• Pathtindebs of the West. By A. C. Laut, Illus- 
trated. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



of the romantic and adventurous lives of Radis- 
son, LaVerendrye, Heame, Mackenzie, and 
Lewis and Clark. Above all it is the story of 
Radisson, in whose behalf Miss Laut unhesi- 
tatingly challenges the giant form of estab- 
lished opinion. In her * Foreword ' she says : 
'The question will at once occur why no mention 
is made of Marquette and Jolliet and La Salle in 
a work on the pathfinders of the West. The simple 
answer is — they were not pathfinders. Contrary to 
the notions imbibed at school, and repeated in all 
histories of the "West, Marquette, Jolliet, and La 
Salle did not discover the vast region beyond the 
Great Lakes. Twelve years before these explorers 
had thought of visiting the land which the French 
hunter designated as the Pays d'en Haut, the West 
had already been discovered by the most intrepid 
voyageurs that France produced, — men whose wide- 
ranging explorations exceeded the achievements of 
Gartier and Champlain and La Salle put together.' 

Thus Miss Laut throws down the gauntlet to 
the historians, and we learn from the ' Adden- 
dum " to her * Foreword ' that her statements 
have already been challenged, and sharply chal- 
lenged, from all parts of the country. 

Tlie author's explanation of the long oblivion 
obscuring the names of Sieur Pierre Esprit 
Badisson and his fellow-explorer Menard Chou- 
art Groseillers, is this: 

' Badisson and GroseiUers defied, first New France, 
then Old France, and lastly England. While on 
friendly terms with the church, they did not make 
their explorations subservient to the propagation of^ 
the faith. In consequence, they were ignored by 
both Church and State.' 

After citing the original sources from which 
she has drawn the material for her narrative. 
Miss Laut proceeds: 

'The historians of France and England, animated 
by the hostility of their respective governments, 
either slurred over the discoveries of Badisson and 
GroseiUers entirely, or blackened their memories 
without the slightest regard to truth. It would, in 
fact, take a large volume to contradict and disprove 
half the lies written of these two men. Instead of 
consulting contemporaneous documents, — which 
would have entailed both cost and labor, — modem 
writers have, unfortunately, been satisfied to serve 
up a rehash of the detractions written by the old 
historians. In 1885 came a discovery that punished 
such slovenly methods by practically wiping out 
the work of the pseudo-historians. There was found 
in the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and 
Hudson's Bay House, London, an unmistakably 
authentic record of Badisson 's voyages, written by 
himself. ' 

Having thus dug down to the solid rock of 
contemporaneous documents. Miss Laut pro- 
ceeds to build up her story with consummate 
skill. One can conceive that even the romantic 
story of Pierre Esprit Eadisson might, in some 
hands, have been made dry and uninteresting. 
As here told it is fascinating to the last degree. 
Miss Laut brings to her work not only the 
historian's tireless search for truth, but as weU 
the fire and imagination and creative power of

a novelist and poet. Her work is not merely 
authentic, and founded, as history must always 
be founded, on the original documents, but it 
is vivified by the touch of an artist. The dry 
bones of fragmentary narratives have been 
breathed upon, and the man Radisson, with all 
his faults and all his virtues, stands before us. 

Dr. Dionne of Quebec, Dr. Bryce of Winni- 
peg, and above all the veteran historian of 
French Canada, Benjamin Suite, whose 
'destructive criticism of inaccuracies in old 
and modem records has done so much to stop 
people writing history out of their heads and 
to put research on an honest basis,' have from 
time to time combated the long-established 
prejudice against Radisson and the authenticity 
of his western and northern explorations, but 
it remained for Miss Laut to present his case 
80 vividly and attractively that it becomes a 
positive pleasure to be convinced. 

It is not necessary to assume that every one, 
whether competent to form an authoritative 
opinion or otherwise, must accept unreservedly 
all Miss Laut's conclusions. There will doubt- 
less still remain in many minds moot points 
in connection with Radisson's third and fourth 
voyages. Nevertheless, it may be said without 
fear of serious contradiction that Miss Laut 
has established her main contentions — that 
Radisson discovered the North- West, as well as 
the overland route to Hudson's Bay, — and that 
she has done more than any other writer to 
rehabilitate the memory of the explorer in the 
minds of all unprejudiced people. 

'There is no need to point out Radisson's faults. 
They are written on his life without extenuation or 
excuse, so that all may read. There is less need to 
6ulogize his virtues. They declare themselves in 
every act of his life. This, only, should be remem- 
bered. Like all enthusiasts, Radisson could not 
have been a hero, if he had not been a bit of a fool. 
If he had not had his faults, if he had not been as 
impulsive, as daring, as reckless, as inconstant, as 
improvident of the morrow, as a savage or a child, 
he would not have accomplished the exploration of 
half a continent. Men who weigh consequences are 
not of the stuff to win empires. Had Radisson hag- 
gled as to the means, he would have missed or mud- 
dled the end. He went ahead; and when the way 
did not open, he went round, or crawled over, or 
carved his way through.' 

Only those who have groped their way slowly 
and painfully through the extraordinary mazes 
of Radisson's English, in the original narra- 
tives*, can properly appreciate the charm of 
Miss Laut's version. While maintaining in 
every particular the spirit of the original, and 
even some of its quaint phraseology, she has 

* Here is a sample, taken from the narrative of the 
fourth voyage : " They [the Octanacks] are the coursedest 
unablest, the unfamous and cowardiest people that I have 
seene amongst fower score nations that I have frequented." 
One gathers, at any rate, that Radisson did not think much 
of -the Octanacks. 



condensed here, expanded there, interpreted 
elsewhere, and thrown over the whole the glamor 
of romance, until the narrative stands out as a 
clear, compact, and most graphic story. 

Of the remainder of Miss Laut's book limita- 
tions of space forbid more than the briefest 
mention. While by no means so important as 
contributions to history, her accounts of 
LaVerendrye's quest of the far-famed Western 
Sea, of Samuel Hearne's search for the North- 
west Passage, of Mackenzie's splendid exploits 
in pushing his way north to the Arctic, and 
then crossing the Rockies (the first White Man) 
to the Pacific, and of the notable expedition of 
Lewis and Clark, are marked by the same clear- 
ness of statement and charm of style that we 
have already noted in the Radisson story. 

It only remains to note the number and qual- 
ity of the illustrations with which the narra- 
tives are so plentifully supplied. They number 
some sixty in all, and many of them are from 
old and rare prints, hitherto inaccessible.

The PHiLosoT»Hy of Good Fortttne.* 



There is something essentially modern in a 
moral philosophy that preaches salvation 
through good fortune. For centuries the Stoic 
has had an acknowledgment of merit entirely 
denied to the Epicurean. The Church teaches 
the blessedness of renunciation, penance, and 
asceticism; Kant, apart from the Church, 
builds his philosophy on the doctrine of original 
sin, and finds redemption only in a conscious 
intellectual struggle against inherent human 
weakness and imperfection. Even Tolstoy and 
Maeterlinck advocate the return to Nature that 
implies the inferiority of all man-made devices 
for enriching life. It remains for the twentieth 
century moralists to develop a system that advo- 
cates nothing unpleasant, that takes for granted 
no innate and unconquerable sinfulness in man, 
and that offers a scheme of life based upon a 
secure belief in the ultimate perfection of the 
race through its own effort. 

The growth of this idea has been synchronous 
with the supplementing of the economic doe- 
trine of individual rights by the broader one 
of social rights, and the development from in- 
voluntary social cooperation to voluntary and 
conscious cooperation. The new moral code is, 
in fact, an; outgrowth of the new code of social 
economics. The same methods of reasoning 
that justified the conclusion that child-labor 
was economic waste prove that child-labor is

equally moral waste; the same theory that de- 
nies to a nation a strength greater than the 
strength of its component parts denies to a com- 
munity a social welfare exceeding the good for- 
tune of the individual members of the com- 
munity. 

One of the leading American advocates of the 
new philcKophy is Mr. C. Hanford Henderson, 
whose ' Education and the Larger Life ' marked 
an epoch in literature of its class. In that book, 
published almost three years ago, Mr. Hender- 
son developed the educational side of the ques- 
tion, using the term education not in its narrow 
technical sense but to signify the entire process 
of human development from the cradle to the 
grave. He advxx?ated such a training of the 
senses as woidd lead to the highest and most 
complete expression. His ideal of education 
was that which resulted in the greatest bodily 
strength, intellectual receptivity, and spiritual 
insight. To this he added the idea of efficiency, 
— ^the power to put into successful practice the 
newly acquired knowledge of what was worth 
while. 

This unity of worth and efficiency as a defi- 
nite moral standard is the theme of Mr. Hen- 
derson's latest book, *The Children of Good 
Fortune.' The author states his case thus : 

'To apply morality in the concerns of the indi- 
vidual life is to adopt religion. It is to become the 
highest type of man, the philosopher artist, for the 
philosopher is the man of clear vision, the believer 
in cause and effect, the one who sees in what happi- 
ness essentially consists; and the artist is the doer, 
the man who carries cause and effect into beneficent 
action, and practically reaKzes happiness. The 
philosopher represents worth of ends and the artist 
efficiency of means. The moral person must be a 
combination of the two, the man who knows and 
the man who does. He must be competent and he 
must be wise. If he be neither of these, or only 
one of them, he is not moral, no matter what his 
calling or pretensions, no matter what he thinks of 
himself or others think of him, no matter what his 
family or possessions. The man who demands suc- 
cess of himself demands a great deal, but if he ask 
less he is not in earnest in his search for the moral 
life.' 

Even Browning never preached so rigid a doc- 
trine as that. 

Mr. Henderson has little sympathy with fruit- 
less good intentions. Frankly and uncompro- 
misingly he blames desert for unsuccess. Worth 
of ends without efficiency of means he condemns 
as *the immorality of the second-best,' just as 
completely as he condemns the converse. With 
characteristic humor he writes : ' One would 
prefer to strike for heaven and make only a 
few steps on the journey, rather than to set out 
for Hoboken and get there. But the fact re- 
mains that it would have been still better to 
have made Heaven.' 



Xor is Mr. Henderson content with static 
goodness as a worthy end. To him the good 
life, that which represents good fortune, must 
be palpitating, vital, experimental. There is 
no virtue in inexperience. 

*It is a curiously inverted view of morals, the 
view which regards as praiseworthy those narrow, 
inexperienced, poverty-stricken souls whose slender 
virtue consists in the evil they have omitted to do. 
To renounce the world, to renounce Uf e, to renounce 
the self, — this is not the path of the moral life. The 
timid little souls who live in a corner and keep out 
of harm's way by keeping out of the way of good, 
are not moral persons. They are not even harmless, 
for by their cowardice they inspire others with a 
similar lack of courage. Resignation, renunciation, 
self-sacrifice, asceticism, monasticism, all the cheap 
devices by which men and women abdicate life, are 
as unsound morally as the more amusing devices by 
which men and women abuse life.' 

This radical denunciation of the doctrine of 
self-sacrifice, which we have been accustomed 
to regard as the basis of morality, seemed rev- 
olutionary when it was first met in ' Education 
and the Larger Life.' It was a part of the 
conventional creed that had been taught for 
generations, and that received respect for its 
age if for nothing else. The only way for Mr. 
Henderson to redeem his fault was for him to 
offer, in place of the doctrine he so boldly dis- 
carded, some new code of deeper worth and 
greater efficiency in creating happy human be- 
ings and a better state. This he has done in 
his ' Children of Good Fortune.' 

For self-sacrifice, Mr. Henderson substitutes 
self-realization; for renunciation, that eager 
seeking after good fortune which promotes both 
individual happiness and social welfare. To 
him good fortune is not * a tangible possession, 
to be mentioned in one's last will and testa- 
ment, and subject to the inheritance tax.' It 
is an individual ideal, varying according to 
a man's possession of the human wealth of 
strength, beauty, accomplishment, and goodness. 
To one it is health, to another fame, wealth to 
a third, and knowledge to a fourth. It is that 
which the individual man most wants. 

'Good fortune is a personal possession, an affair 
of consciousness. However a man comes by it, it 
must be his own ideal of good fortune. For no man 
can follow a light which he does not see. The 
tragedy of Ufe comes in large part from the per- 
sistent' attempt to force our own ideas down our 
neighbor 's throat. The pathos of life comes in large 
part from his too amiable compliance, his vain 
attempt to follow a light he does not see. If we 
ourselves have found the light, or believe that we 
have, let us by all means try to reveal it to our 
brother. If he share our confidence in believing 
that we have a light not yet perceived by him, let 
him by all means try to catch sight of the beatific 
vision! But. meanwhile, let us be ourselves, both 
me and my brother, the sincere followers of such 
light as we genuinely have.'

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



The chief necessity for the achievement of 
this good fortune, next to the ambition to 
achieve it, is freedom. We are all bound to a 
greater or less extent by the tyranny of circum- 
stance, hampered by bodily weakness, mental 
or manual incapacity, the accident of birth. 
There seems, in the nature of things, no way to 
escape from these marks of our humanity, al- 
though determined effort may lessen the evils 
entailed. But there is a freedom that any state 
may well attain when there are within it enough 
individuals who desire this as a part of their 
good fortune. That is the mingKng of the 
anarchist ideal of non-interference and the so- 
cialist ideal of opportunity, which shall still 
leave to the individual his initiative while se- 
curing to him the nearest possible release from 
the tyranny of things. This is only another in- 
stance of the unity of social welfare and indi- 
vidual good fortune. Every man who desires 
such freedom in his own life and works to se- 
cure it for himself helps to give it to those more 
helplessly bound, to raise the standard of gen- 
eral good fortune. Summing up his arguments 
in favor of the new philosophy, Mr. Henderson 
writes : 

' To save myself, — and therefore to save that part 
of society for which I am directly responsible, — 1 
must do three things. I must blot out all impulses 
and desires that are evil. It is negative work, 
rather a dull sort of weeding in the garden of the 
heart, and not calculated to arouse any great enthu- 
siasm, but it is very necessary. Then I must culti- 
vate the impulses and desires that are good, make 
habits of them, for the garden devoid of wheat is 
hardly better than a garden full of tares. Finally 
I must work, not merely for good fortune, for happi- 
ness, but for high good fortune, for great happiness. 
I want not only to be saved from evil and to attain 
good, but I want the largest good, the most wel- 
fare. ' 

It is this insatiable greed for happiness, this 
longing for more and ever more good fortune, 
which all of Mr. Henderson's work breathes, 
that makes it inspiring and effective. It satis- 
fies a natural human instinct, — the desire to be- 
lieve that happiness is righteousness and that 
every man possesses within himself that power 
of pereonal salvation that shall be also the sal- 
vation of the race. Mr. Henderson's books, 
moreover, are not written from strange heights 
which none but the moral philosopher can scale. 
They are clear and simple, showing a rare first- 
hand knowledge of the larger life. They com- 
bine to an unusual extent the attitudes of the 
observer and the experimentalist; they are at 
once dispassionate and enthusiastic. It is easy 
to predict for ' The Children! of Good Fortune ' 
a welcome equal to that accorded to ' Education 
and the Larger Life,' and one equally deserved.

The ' 'White Since the Boxer uprising of five 
Peril' in years ago much has been made 

the Orient. of the so-called 'yellow peril' and 

of the alleged necessity that rests upon west- 
ern peoples to exercise eternal vigilance to 
protect themselves against a threatened gigantic 
outburst of Oriental savagery and lust of con- 
quest. It has remained for Dr. Sidney L. Gulick, 
in his recent book on ' The White Peril in the Far 
East' (Bevell), to turn matters around and con- 
sider the relations of Orient and Occident exclu- 
sively from the standpoint of the traditions and 
interests of the former. That Dr. Gulick is 
entirely competent to speak upon the subject no 
one can doubt who has read his deservedly popu- 
lar volume on 'The Evolution of the Japanese.' 
After seventeen years of constant intercourse 
with men in all stations in Japan he is able to 
give us, not only a highly interesting interpreta- 
tion of the fundamental character of Japanese 
civilization and life, but also a thoroughly con- 
vincing statement of the attitude of the Japanese 
toward the outside world to-day, especially as 
revealed in the conduct of the war with Russia. 
This, indeed, is the main purport of the book, — 
to show how Japan attained the power, 
material and temperamental, to face and conquer 
the Muscovite, and to explain the significance 
of the war as 'an act in the tragedy of the white 
peril.' By the white peril Dr. Gulick means at 
bottom the proneness of western nations to force 
the peoples of the Orient out of their natural 
channels of development, through efforts to 
exploit their economic resources and donainate 
their affairs for political, commercial, or financial 
ends. For Japan the danger has in times past 
been very real; to-day it scarcely exists, except 
from Russia, and the prospective outcome of the 
present war promises at least temporary relief 
from that quarter. If upon its first intimate con- 
tact with western races an Oriental people has 
backbone enough to adopt ideas and institutions 
that are beneficent without falling into mere ser- 
vility, the white peril becomes for it the white 
blessing; and this, on the whole, is what Japan 
has done. 'The white peril,' says Dr. Gulick, 
'so long feared, has proved for Japan to be the 
very tonic and stimulus required to place her in 
the advance guard of progressive nations.' The 
field where the white peril is most seriously to be 
reckoned with is China, for there seems small 
ground for hope that China will succeed as 
Japan has done in thwarting the designs of 
greedy nations upon her integrity. Dr. Gulick 
expects Japanese victory in the present war to 
have some weight in inducing the white man to 
treat the yellow man with justice and civility, 
but in his judgment the problem of the white 
peril can be solved ultimately only through belief 
on part of the white race in the essential equality 
in worth and rights of all men. To any one inter- 
ested in the larger aspects of contemporary 
world-politics, as well as in the ethics of inter-

national and interracial relations, Dr. Guliek's 
little book must commend itself as a valuable 
piece of work. While in no way profound, it is 
rich in novel and suggestive points of view. It 
contains one of the best statements of the real 
causes of the war with Russia j'et published, and 
gives an interpretation of the Japanese attitude 
toward the conflict that is agreeably clear, con- 
cise, and illuminating. 

Glimpses of Of society's polished horde, but 
high life not in this instance the bores and 

in Rome. the bored, Madame Mary King 

Waddington's second instalment of letters, 
'Italian Letters of a Diplomat's Wife' (Scrib- 
ner), gives many a pleasing glimpse. As seen 
through her eyes the men and women she meets 
are all interesting and interested. Three months 
—February, March, April, 1880— were spent by 
her and her husband in Italy, chiefly in Rome. 
M. Waddington had just resigned the French pre- 
miership, and the two were off on a vacation. 
Eugene Schuyler, who had manied a sister of 
Mme. Waddington, was then consul-general at 
Rome, and of the Schuylers and numerous other 
King and Waddington friends and connections 
we hear much in the course of the book. The 
high oflicial and social station of our tourists 
secured them the most cordial reception in the 
highest quarters. At an audience with the Pope, 
his Holiness advanced to meet them so hospitably 
that the regulation curtseys were impossible ; and 
he even made them sit down, one on each side of 
him, and they had a really interesting three- 
quarters-of-an-hour talk. As Mme. Waddington 
speaks of having some years before 'approached' 
Pope Pius IX., and as she afterward describes 
an audience with the present pontiff, the reader 
incidentally acquires some little familiarity with 
papal receptions. Audiences with King* Hum- 
bert, with Queen Margherita, a dinner at the Ger- 
man Embassy with Crown Princess Frederick, 
balls and other functions at the different embas- 
sies, and a succession of less important society 
events, furnish ample matter for the letters Mme. 
Waddington so dutifully and so frequently 
despatched to her mother in America and to other 
members of the family. Twenty-four years later, 
in the same three months of February, March, 
and April, she revisited Italy, this time a widow, 
and took up the old round of sight-seeing and 
social functions. The book as a whole, though 
entertaining, hardly equals its predecessor in 
interest. It has no comation of a Czar, for one 
thing; and perhaps the scenes described are too 
familiar to arouse and sustain the keenest curi- 
osity. One queries, too, whether here and there 
a letter has not been 'doctored' for the press, as 
for example the one containing a long reminis- 
cent passage (more than twenty pages) describ- 
ing an ascent of Vesuvius and other events that 
occurred in 1867. A delightfully human touch is 
Queen Elena's chat about her children and how 
they prized above their other playthings a rag 
doll given them by the wife of the American 
Ambassador. Numerous illustrations accompany 
the text, but most of the portraits are disappoint- 
ing. 



Chapters on That the drama does not occupy 
contemporary anything like its rightful position 
dramatists. in modem English literature, that 
it is not in England or America a vital intellect- 
ual force as it is in France, and Germany, and 
even in the lesser European countries, is a fact 
so obvious that it hardly calls for statement. 
The remedy for an evil is apt to follow a close 
realization of its existence, and the wider our 
acquaintance with what the Continental stage is 
doing for literature, the nearer we shall come to 
the rehabilitation of a branch of letters in which 
England once set a shining example for the rest 
of the world. For this reason, if for no other, 
we should welcome such books as Mr. James 
Huneker's 'Iconoclasts' (Scribner) and Professor 
Edward Everett Hale's 'Dramatists of To-day' 
(Holt) . But both books deserve a welcome on their 
own account, for they are noteworthy examples 
of literary criticism in one of the most interesting 
of literary fields. Mr. Huneker's book discusses 
no less than twelve contemporary dramatists, 
while Mr. Hale's book considers four of the same 
list, and adds three others. The writers discussed 
in both books are Herr Hauptmann, Herr Suder- 
mann, M. Maeterlinck, and Mr. Shaw; Mr. Hale's 
list is completed by M. Rostand, Mr. Pinero, and 
Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Huneker's by Dr. Ibsen, 
Herr Strindberg, Mil. Becque and Hervieu, 
Yilliers de I'Isle Adam, Princess Mathilde, Sig. 
d'Annunzio, and Mr. Gorky. The two books 
together are thus seen to provide a varied menu 
of the most interesting character, although its 
thorough digestion by English stomachs (not 
wholly used to such strong meat) may be a matter 
of some diflSculty. Mr. Huneker's manner of 
writing is pointed and almost brilliant, but the 
joumadistic origin of his essays is too apparent. 
He is sometimes violent in his way of saying 
things, as if he were determined, writing about 
'iconoclasts,' to show that he could, an he would, 
do a pretty 'stunt' at image-breaking himself. 
He gives us many epigrams, some his own, 
others felicitously borrowed for the occasion. His 
longest paper is upon Dr. Ibsen, and is useful for 
its summaries of plots, besides being stimulating 
in its suggestiveness. Professor Hale's book has 
a na'ivetS of style that is engaging, and he estab- 
lishes confidential relations with the reader from 
the start. But his impressionistic method and 
conversational maimer do not preclude the exhibi- 
tion of verj' definite opinions, clearly reasoned 
and amply fortified by example. Besides the 
discussions of his seven chosen dramatists, he 
gives us a 'Note on Standards of Criticism', and 
an essay on ' Our Idea of Tragedy '. An appendix 
presents a useful table of plays, with the dates 
and places of their first productions. A certain 
portion of the contents of this book will be recog- 
nized by our readers as having been reprinted 
from The Dial, but they will find it well worth 
reading a second time.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



after Victor Hugo's death. An examination 
showed them to comprise a fragment of a journal 
and some letters addressed to the poet. The 
journal seems to be a small part of the journal 
of Frangois Hugo described by M. Octave Uzanne 
in 'Scribner's Magazine' in 1892. It contains 
nothing of importance. Of the letters, two are 
from a young woman who writes in an ecstacy of 
admiration and devotion to arrange further 
secret interviews with her * sublime poet'; they 
were written during the fall of 1851. The others, 
about forty in number, are from 'Juliette,' the 
beautiful Princess Negroni of the first represen- 
tations of 'Lucrece Borgia,' who, as everybody 
knows, was destined to play in the drama of Vic- 
tor Hugo's life, as Madame Drouet, a part infi- 
nitely more important than any that her meagre 
histrionic talents permitted her to aspire to in 
the mimic actions of the stage. These letters, 
with one exception, are also from 1851. The 
other, from 1836, is the only one of real interest 
in connection with the history of the poet. These 
letters exhibit the attitude of Madame Drouet 
towards Hugo, but not for the first time. They 
but repeat the expressions of letters that had 
already been published. And though this repe- 
tition was doubtless sweet to the object of 
Madame Drouet 's devotion, and perhaps did not 
cease to be so through all the thousands of mis- 
sives (six thousand are still preserved) of that 
long correspondence, it is not particularly illu- 
mining to the student of Victor Hugo's life or 
interesting to the general reader. These letters 
are, however, now made the occasion for the pub- 
lication of a book of one hundred and fifty pages 
of wide-spaced lines and open print, of which the 
letters fill about fifty pages. Twenty pages are 
given to an introductory notice by M. Francois 
Coppee, in which personal reminiscences and anec- 
dotes of Hugo, not always new, are told with a 
charm that suffers sometimes at the hands of the 
translator, and not without a sly thrust at 
Hugo's republicanism in a reference to the pres- 
ent republic's use of exile as a mode of dealing 
with political opponents. The rest of the book is 
mainly taken up with a rather scrappy account of 
Hugo's life and home surroundings at Haute- 
ville House, in the course of which Mr. Wack 
betrays the fact that he is no authority on mat- 
ters of Hugo biography. Less than twenty pages 
are devoted to the story of the 'Romance of Vic- 
tor Hugo and Juliette Drouet' that the title 
promises ; and these pages are but a rather unsat- 
isfactory summary of an article by M. Leon 
Seche in the 'Revue de Paris' for February 15, 
1903. There was in Mr. Wack's treasure-trove 
hardly the excuse for a short magazine article. 
His book is quite without adequate raison d' etre. 
(Putnam.) 

Dr. Alexander H. Japp, who found 
about 'R.l'.s.' ^ publisher for 'Treasure Island' 

and a public for its author, has a 
better warrant than most to write about Steven- 
son. Of this, he has taken advantage in his 
recently-published volume entitled 'Robert Louis 
Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Mem- 
orial' (Scribner), in which some personal remi- 



niscence is supplemented by much criticism, 
original and quoted, and by a little controversy. 
The chapters supplying the latter element deal 
with Lord Rosebery as an amateur critic, and 
with Mr. Gosse as an authority on the subject of 
the history of the 'Treasure Island' manu- 
script. The criticism is largely of the familiar 
appreciative order; and since so few dissentient 
voices are admitted to the chorus of praise, it 
seems a pity to give so much prominence to Mr. 
Henley's unfortunate utterance. There can be 
little need to-day of lengthy quotation from this 
article, even for the sake of refutation. Dr. 
Japp gives Stevenson's dramatic attempts a 
decidedly fuller share of consideration than they 
have hitherto received from most critics. Accord- 
ing to him, the chief flaw of these compositions 
is lack of ethical purpose,— a failure to believe 
that 'goodness and self-sacrifice and surrender 
are the only strength in the universe.' The 
admission might seem to render untenable the 
position in the ranks of the optimists that, curi- 
ously enough, seems to have been awarded Stev- 
enson to-day by almost universal consent. But 
Dr. Japp qualifies his criticism by ascribing Stev- 
enson's immoral and consequently undramatic 
belief that ' badheartedness was strength' to 
the influence of Mr. Henley. It seems as though 
a phrase in a passage quoted from M. Marcel 
Schwob might go further towards explaining 
Stevenson's weakness as a dramatist, as well as 
his failure in other respects, with all his mar- 
vellous attainments, to reach the highest level. 
In speaking of Stevenson's characters, M. 
Schwob says: 'Ce sont des fantomes de la v^rite; 
hallueinants comme de vrais fantomes.' And to 
those readers who, loving Stevenson the man no 
less than the writer, are yet able to see him with- 
out the glamor through which some of his wor- 
shippers delight to gaze at their idol, the criti- 
cism may seem to have application to the life of 
its subject as well as to his work. In the dedi- 
cation of 'David Balfour,' written shortly before 
his death, Stevenson said that 'he bowed his head 
before the romance of destiny.' Destiny had in 
truth given him a life full of the romance that 
he loved, but in so doing set him something 
apart from the rest of us, to whom losses and 
gains come more dully. And if the life he gave 
his characters seems more unreal than that which 
belongs to the work of less skilful artists, what 
wonder? 

The life and '^^^ notion that artists are the fit- 
work of test persons to write understand- 

Aliert Durer. ingly about art and artists would 
be truer were discernment always matched by 
power of verbal expression. Mr. T. Sturge 
Moore's volume on Albert Diirer, Avhich is the 
latest addition to the 'Library of Art' (Scrib- 
ner), is an instance of an excellent book marred 
by an involved and slipshod style. This, together 
with the rambling treatment and frequent use of 
metaphor, makes it somewhat difficult to read. 
Three sentences from the first of the biographi- 
cal chapters may be cited as characteristic. 

' It is perhaps Impossible to place oneself in the centre 
of that horizon which was of necessity his and belonged 
to his day, a vast circle from which men could no more

escape than we from ours ; this cage of iron ignorance 
[sici in which every human soul is trapped, and to widen 
and enlarge which every heroic soul lives and dies. This 
cage appeared to his eyes very different from what It does 
to ours ; yet it has always been a cage, and is only lost 
sight of at times when the light from within seems to flow 
forth, and with its radiant sapphire heaven of buoyancy 
and desire to veil the eternal bars. It is well to remind 
ourselves that ignorance was the most momentous, the 
most cruel condition of his life, as of our own ; and that 
the effort to relieve himself of Its pressure, either by the 
pursuit of knowledge, or by giving spur and bridle to the 
imagination that it might course round him dragging the 
great woof of illusion and tent him in the ethereal dream 
of the soul's desire, was the constant effort and resource 
of his days.' 

Comment is supplied by the author himself when 
he says, though in another connection, that 'it is 
easier to bob to such phrases than to understand 
them.' The book does not claim to embody any 
new research. In form it is an elaborate essay, 
or sequence of essays, on Diirer's life and work, 
considered in relation to certain general ideas 
which are rather vaguely set forth in the first 
section. In deference, no doubt, to Diirer's 
search for a canon of proportion for the human 
figure, the opening chapter deals with various 
truisms under the caption of 'The Idea of Pro- 
pK>rtion,' as the author calls it, though 'composi- 
tion' is the usual term for what he has in mind. 
This is followed by a chapter on the influence of 
religion on the creative impulse, which Mr. Moore 
holds to be the vital force that prevents its per- 
vei'sion or exhaustion. The really valuable parts 
of the book are those that deal with Diirer's life 
in relation to his times, and with his work as a 
creator. The chapters on the former subject 
have been drawn chiefly from Sir Martin Con- 
way's 'Literary Remains of Albrecht Diirer' and 
Professor Thausing's Life of Diirer. So far as 
possible the story is told in the artist's own words, 
through extracts from his letters and diary, and 
is of great interest. In his estimate of Diirer as 
an artist Mr. Moore is eminently sound and dis- 
criminating. Here he is on sure ground, and his 
words may be taken without the grain of salt 
that is needed in reading other parts of his work. 
He sees clearly in what the greatness of Diirer 
consists,— that he was a marvellous draughts- 
man, an engraver of unsurpassed skill, a designer 
of the very first rank, but not a painter born, in 
the sense that Titian and Correggio and Rem- 
brandt were, or the equal of these masters as a 
colourist. The author's aesthetic judgments are 
made more intelligible by the abundant illustra- 
tions, many of them from drawings and the less 
well-known works of the artist. These are ac- 
ceptably reproduced; and through the courtesy 
of the Diirer Society four of their photogravures 
of copperplate engravings are included. 

Mr. Robert Ross, to whose care the 
fasTvoYuLT inanuscript was confided, has 

edited Oscar "Wilde's posthumous 
work 'De Profundis' (Putnam), written during 
the unhappy man's imprisonment and preceding 
in point of time the composition of 'The Ballad 
of Reading Gaol.' The essay has, as might be 
expected, great literary charm, and possesses im- 
questioned authenticity as a contribution toward 



the comprehension of the abnormal and in many 
ways inexplicable psychology of its author. 
WiJde confesses to nothing more than a sense of 
outrage upon finding himself reduced to the sorry 
lot of a common felon, confirming the impression 
that he was quite without sense of guilt. It can- 
not be said that at any point in his narrative 
does remorse for his crime manifest itself; he is 
content with reprobation of the general hedonism 
by which he governed his destiny; contrition and 
repentance in the theological sense are unknown 
to him. Nor is it clear that a more refined sort 
of hedonism does not p>ersist. Most interesting 
of all the questions raised by a reading of the 
narrative is the writer's attitude toward Christ, 
whose character Wilde believes himself to com- 
prehend better than others. But he nevertheless 
regards the gospel account as chiefly wonderful 
for its complete and rounded literary charm,— 
the sesthetic aspect is still all-important. The 
end arrived at by Wilde appears to be a species 
of Nature worship. 'I am conscious now,' he 
writes in conclusion, 'that behind all this beauty, 
satisfying though it may be, there is some spirit 
hidden of which the painted forms and shapes 
are but modes of manifestation, and it is with 
this spirit that I desire to become in harmony. 
I have grown tired of the articulate utterances 
of men and things. . . . Society, as we have 
constituted it, will have no place for me, has none 
to offer, but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on 
unjust and just alike, will have clefts in the rocks 
where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose 
. silence I may weep undisturbed. ' 

Daring deeds in ^^f- Gardner W. Allen has dealt 
the early days with a brilliant and hitherto neg- 
0/ our navy. lected chapter in the naval annals 
of the United States in his volume on ' Our Navy 
and the Barbary Corsairs' (Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co.). The book covers the entire ground of our 
official dealings with Algeria, Tripoli, Morocco, 
and Tunis from the recognition of our nationality 
by Great Britain down to the extirpation of 
piracy by the treaty with Algiers in December, 
1816. Several naval expeditions reflecting the 
highest credit upon the service, the nation, and 
the best interests of the world at large, were un- 
dertaken during this period, and aside from the 
direct results accomplished were of great im- 
portance as affording a training school for that 
gallant race of captains who so effectually dis- 
appointed the British on the sea in the War of 
1812. The operations included two deeds of the 
finest courage— the cutting out of the 'Phila- 
delphia,' which the incomparable Nelson himself 
called 'the most daring act of the age,' and the 
entry into the port of Tripoli of Richard Somers, 
Henry Wadsworth (the maternal uncle of Long- 
fellow, from whom the poet was named), and 
Joseph Israel. Besides the op>erations at sea, 
there was a land expedition almost unrecorded in 
our annals, since it does not come within the 
scope of our naval history and was not officered 
by any member of the regular army. Dr. Allen 
has made his work thorough and authoritative, 
but betravs a needless distrust of his own de-

scriptive powers, leaving the more dramatic 
events to be described almost entirely in the 
words of eye-witnesses. The book is supplied 
with portraits and maps of value and interest. 

A Frenchman's The present is a time for interna- 
impressions of tional interpretations, and Vicomte 
Greater Britain. Robert d'Humieres shows gi-eat 
good nature, much wit, and the point of view we 
characterize as French in his book entitled 
'Through Isle and Empire' (Doubleday, Page & 
Co.), which Mr. Alexander Teixera de Mattos has 
admirably translated into English. The author 
often reverts in his writings to Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling as the typical Englishman, and Mr. Kip- 
ling returns the compliment in a prefatory letter, 
polite enough, but differing from the author in 
several respects. The Vicomte seems to have had 
a pleasant time in his sojourn under the British 
flag, beginning with London during the corona- 
tion and passing through England and thence to 
India, and he writes of it all with ease and 
vivacity. He exhibits the usual failure to under- 
stand any aspect of English puritanism, and that 
inexplicable attitude of the Frenchman toward 
the Frenchwoman which is not the least of the 
reasons for the world's misunderstanding her. 
As a ride (though this is denied in the introduc- 
tion) nothing but good is said of the English, 
their goings out and comings in, their sports and 
pastimes, and their normal attitude toward life. 
It is in India that the Vicomte shines chiefly; 
there of all places is the opportunity given for a 
man of southern race to tell the story of a race 
more southern, more religious, more ancient, and 
more subtle. Especially to be commended are 
the discourses upon Indian and Moslem art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the publishers of 
a third edition (not apparently differing from the 
second) of Amelia B. Edwards's ' "Untrodden Peaks 
and Unfrequented Valleys.' This description of the 
Dolomite country has kept its interest remarkably 
well for the past thirty years and more, and we are 
glad to welcome it in its most recent garb. 

Copyright Office Bulletin No. 8 of the Library of 
Congress is a very valuable work indeed. It is a 
volume of more than four hundred pages, bearing 
the title 'Copyright in Congress, 1789-1904,' and 
gives us ' a bibliography and chronological record 
of all proceedings in Congress in relation to copy- 
right,' during the entire period of our national his- 
tory. Mr. Thorvald Solberg is the compiler of the 
work. 

Mr. Charles Sprague Sargent's 'Manual of the 
Trees of North America ' (exclusive of Mexico) 
presents in compact form for the use of students the 
immense mass of information upon its subject gath- 
ered by the author during thirty years of investiga- 
tion, and already presented in his 'Silva of North 
America ' in monumental form. The volume is one 
of about eight hundred pages, describing over six 
hundred species, the descriptions being accompanied 
by about the same number of illustrations, Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co, are the publishers of this 
invaluable work. 



A 'History of the United States from 986 to 1905' 
(Harper), by Messrs. Thomas Wentworth Higginson 
and William Macdonald, turns out to be Colonel 
Higginson 's ' History of the United States of Amer- 
ica, ' with some revisions of the original text, and 
continued from Jackson's administration down to 
the present date. It has a new set of illustrations 
and maps, and is one of the most readable histories 
of this country ever written. 

The fifth edition of 'A Dictionary of American 
Authors,' by Mr. Oscar Fay Adams, is published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The text of the 
preceding edition is reproduced with comparatively 
few alterations, the new matter being relegated to 
a supplement, which contains 1325 new names. The 
work is thus made much more useful than before, 
although the inconvenience of searching through two 
alphabets must be regarded as an unfortunate 
feature. 

'Ethical Addresses' (1305 Arch St., Philadelphia) 
has been published in enlarged form since last Sep- 
tember, and each of the monthly issues is now an 
attractively printed pamphlet of about forty pages, 
containing two or three papers or lectures. Among 
the papers recently printed are 'Is Life Worth 
Living?' by Professor William James; 'Ethics in 
the Schools,' by Mr. W. M. Salter; 'What It Means 
to Work for a Cause,' by Mr. Walter L. Sheldon; 
and 'Shall Ostracism Be Used by Religious Socie- 
ties in the Struggle against Public Iniquity? ' by 
Professor Felix Adler. We wish that this admirable 
publication might have (to put it moderately) one- 
tenth the circulation that it deserves. The combina- 
tion of earnestness with high intellectual quality 
possessed by most of the papers included should com- 
mend them to all thoughtful readers. 

Two volumes of Letters complete the handsome 
library edition of 'The Works of Charles and Mary 
Lamb,' as edited by Mr. E. V. Lucas, which the 
Messrs. Putnam have for some time been engaged in 
publishing. The letters of Mary Lamb are now for 
the first time included in such an edition, while 
about seventy of Charles's letters are now printed 
for the first time. L^^nfortunately, the present col- 
lection is not complete, because many other letters 
are still under copyright, and will remain so for 
some two score years to come. To obtain a complete 
set of the letters now in print means the purchase 
of nine works (in many more volumes), while new 
letters are all the time coming to light. American 
autograph collectors, Mr. Lucas notes, have been 
particularly disobliging in their unwillingness to 
permit their treasures to be drawn upon for the 
present publication. 

'Translations of German Poetry in American 
Magazines, 1741-1810,' by Dr. Edward Ziegler Davis, 
is an interesting volume published at Philadelphia 
by the Americana Germanica Press. The author 
has ransacked very thoroughly the magazines of 
the seventy years covered by his investigation, and 
has listed all the articles giving information about 
Germany and other Teutonic countries. The poems 
are in most cases reprinted in full, the names 
occurring most frequently being those of Gellert, 
Gessner, Burger, and Goethe. Biirger's 'Lenore' 
inspired many American versifiers to translation or 
imitation, and the number of compositions inspired 
by 'Werther' is really remarkable. Most of this 
matter is poor enough stuff as literature, but some 
of the parodies are noteworthy, showing the Amer- 
ican humorist to have been very much alive in the 
later eighteenth century. One burlesque (p. 143) 
of the German ballad may be commended to the 
attention of anthologists as well worth preserving.

Notes. 



It has been found necessary to postpone until next 
autumn the publication of the collection of- Ibsen 
Letters previously announced by Messrs. Fox, Duf- 
field & Co. 

The next novel by Mr. Eider Haggard will be pub- 
lished in this country by Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co. 'Ayesha, ' as the new book is called, forms a 
sequel to Mr. Haggard's most famous story, 'She.' 

A new novel by Mrs, Hugh Fraser, entitled ' A 
Maid of Japan,' will be published this month by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The same firm has also 
in press a storv of Kentucky life called * The Venus 
of Cadiz.' 

An excellent blank verse translation of Oehlen- 
schlager's ' Hakon Jarl, ' the work of Mr. James 
Christian Lindberg, is to be found in the January 
number of the 'University Studies' published by 
the University of Nebraska. 

The famous 'Eowfant' library of the late Fred- 
erick Locker-Lampson, one of the richest private 
collections ever brought together, has recently been 
acquired by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., who will 
offer it for sale to American collectors. 

Baedeker's * Northern France, ' including the 
country from the Channel to the Loire, is published 
in its fourth English edition, and imported for the 
American market by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. There are thirteen maps and forty plans. 

'The Sonnets of Michael Angelo Buonarroti,' in 
the rhymed translation of John Addington Symonds, 
has reached a second edition, which is imported by 
the Messrs. Scribner. It will be remembered that 
this book gives us the Italian text, each sonnet fac- 
ing its translation. 

A revised edition of the 'Mediaeval and Modem 
History' of Professor Philip Yan Ness Myers is 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It is a work of 
over seven hundred pages, with rich illustrative 
equipment, and exemplifies to a notable degree the 
modem art of text-book-niaking. 

'The van Dyke Book,' edited by Dr. Edward 
Mims, and published by the Messrs. Scribner, is a 
volume of selections from the writings of the Eev. 
Henry van Dyke, prepared for child readers both in 
and out of school. Miss Brooke van Dyke supplies 
a biographical sketch of her father. 

A volume of 'Reminiscences of G. F. Watts, E.A.,' 
will be published in about a month by the Maemil- 
lan Co. Mrs. Eussell Barrington, the author of the 
book, was a most intimate friend of "Watts during 
the last forty-five years of his life. The volume 
will be illustrated with reproductions of Watts 's 
paintings. 

The latest of the special Riverside Press Editions 
is a reprint of 'A Consolatorie Letter' written by 
Plutarch 'unto his owne wife as touching the death 
of her and his daughter.' This letter forms one of 
the less-known chapters in the ' Morals, ' and is here 
given in Philemon Holland's translation. Judging 
from the specimen that we have seen, the typog- 
raphy is distinctive and appropriate. The book 
is presented almost entirely without ornament. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. will publish this 
month Mr. Russell Sturgis's 'The Interdependence 
of the Arts of Design,' a series of lectures delivered 
at The Art Institute of Chicago; another of Mr. 
Sherwin Cody's useful compilations, 'A Selection 
from the Great English Poets'; and 'Iowa: The 
First Free State in the Louisiana Purchase,' from 
its earliest discovery to the admission of the state 
into the Union, by Dr. William Salter. 



The Summer School of Library Economy con- 
ducted at Amhurst College for many years past by 
Mr. William I, Fletcher, will hold its fifteenth ses- 
sion this summer from July 3 to August 11, a term 
of six weeks. There are no special requirements 
(beyond an ordinary high-school education) for ad- 
mission to this course. 

Mr. William Alexander 's volume on ' The Life In- 
surance Company,' to be published this month in 
Messrs. Appletons' ' Business Series,' will have an 
especial timeliness just now. The book is a general 
treatise on the history, aims, and accomplishment of 
life insurance, written from thorough practical 
knowledge and experience. 

A uniform edition of the dramatic works of Hen- 
rik Ibsen, to be sold singly or in sets at a reasonable 
price, is announced for early publication by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner 's Sons. The edition will consist of 
seven or eight volumes, and will be made up in the 
main of the authorized Archer translations. The 
biographical, bibliographical, and critical apparatus, 
including introductions to the plays, notes, etc., will 
be unusually full and should prove of much service 
to the student of the Norwegian dramatist. 

The extended list of books relating to the Philip- 
pine Islands will receive an important and authori- 
tative addition in the volume on 'Our Philippine 
Problem,' by Professor H. Parker Willis of Wash- 
ington and Lee University, which Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. expect to issue before the end of the 
month. The writer is well qualified for the task of 
preparing this work by personal investigation, both 
in the Philippines and in official circles in Washing- 
ton, and by his journalistic experience as editorial 
writer for several of the best American newspapers. 

Not long ago the Harvard CoUege Library came 
into possession of an edition, dated 1617, of an hith- 
erto unknown poem by Samuel Rowlands entitled 
'The Bride.' From this copy, which is believed to 
be unique, a facsimile reprint has been made by the 
Merrymount Press, and is published in a limited 
edition by Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed. The poem 
itself is of little account, being hardly up to the 
mediocre level of its author's best work; but owners 
of the Hunterian Club edition of Rowlands will 
want it to complete that work, and book-lovers gen- 
erally will be glad to have the volume for the sake 
of the very unique and interesting setting that 
Mr. Updike has given it. 

The series of twelve photogravure facsimiles of 
rare fifteenth century books printed in England 
and now in the University Library, Cambridge, 
which the Cambridge University Press has in prepa- 
ration, wiU be issued in this country by the Mae- 
miUan Co. The first four books are: Chaucer's 
'Anelida and Arcite,' from the unique copy of the 
Westminster edition of William Caxton (1477-8); 
'Augustini Dacti Scribe sup Tullianis elogancijs & 
verbis exoticis in sua facundissima Rethorica in- 
cipit pornate libellus, ' from the unique copy printed 
at St. Albans (about 1479-80) by 'The Schoolmaster 
Printer'; 'The Temple of glas' by John Lydgate, 
from the unique copy of the Westminster edition of 
William Caxton (1477-8); and 'Thomas Betson's 
Ryght profytable treatyse' (from St. Jerome, St. 
Bernard, Gerson, etc.) (1500), from the copy printed 
by Wynkyn de Worde in Caxton 's house. Only two 
hundred copies of each will be for sale. 

Under the title of 'Types of American Litera- 
ture,' Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. announce an 
interesting series of literary studies which ought to 
prove valuable to the critical reader of books as 
well as to students and scholars. The series is to 
consist of a number of monographs, each volume

Some Press Comments on The Dial's Twenty=fifth Anniversary 



The Dial, that excellent literary periodical which is 
published in Chicago, celebrates on May i its twenty- 
fifth anniversary. Mr. Francis F. Browne, who edited 
the first number, still directs the policy of the paper, and 
to him and his colleagues the warmest congratulations are 
to be offered on the rounding out of a quarter of a century 
of useful and successful work. The leading editorial in 
the current number is written in a modest strain. The 
editor contents himself with saying that the effort of his 
paper has been "to achieve distinction through consist- 
ency and persistency; to be itself, with its own standards 
and character; to have its ideals and live up to them." 
But to the many readers of The Dial, and especially to 
those laboring in the same field which has benefited by its 
activities, it must be a pleasure to testify to the valuable 
services rendered by this sturdy publication; it has been not 
only consistent and persistent in the cause of high literary 
standards. It has brought judgment, taste, enthusiasm, 
to the execution of its task. If it has been active in the 
dissemination of sound opinions, it has also done invaluable 
work in helping to create in the West that atmosphere 
which means not so much the making of opinion, but the 
development of a feeling for literary interests generally. 
Not alone in Chicago, but throughout a wide territory. 
The Dial has been a force in raising up readers of books 
of all kinds. It has steadily increased, both in influence 
and in prosperity, and it passes its twenty-fifth anniver- 
sary to continue upon a campaign in which it has the 
good will of everyone concerned in the welfare of literary 
journalism. ^^^^ York Tribune. 

During all these years The Dial has been an inde- 
pendent critical journal among many "literary organs" 
whose tune has almost always been in harmony with the 
literature published by the house which simultaneously 
owned both books and periodicals. It is refreshing to 
know that this, the only journal in America given up 
exclusively to the criticism of current literature, and the 
only literary periodical not owned or controlled by a 
book publishing house or a newspaper, has its home in 
Chicago. That a paper like The Dial should be printed 
for a quarter of a century, continually sending forth its 
clean pages of well balanced criticism, is surely cause for 
felicitation. Its existence must prove stimulating to good 
taste and a love of good literature, May it live long to 
record the sunny hours of prosperity and progress. 

The Standard (Chicago). 

With its issue dated April i6. The Dial completes a 
quarter of a century of such service to American literature 
as has been rendered by no other periodical. This does 
not mean that there has been no other competent literary 
criticism in the United States — ^ though the sum total of 
that worth any consideration has been slight indeed by 
comparison. But The Dial has been the only journal to 
set for itself as an exclusive task to weigh, to measure, 
in some degree to interpret, and to pronounce judgment 
upon the current literary output. This was the purpose 
with which it was founded twenty-five years ago, and to 
this ideal it has held unswervingly, making no attempt to 
be "popular,".but maintaining always the serene dignity, 
somewhat austere, yet kindly, befitting a Court of Last 
Resort. Wherever it is known, its utterances carry with 
them the weight that always attaches to the deliberate voice 
of the scholar speaking upon the subjects in which he is 

^''P*'^- Out West (Los Angeles). 



With its current issue The Dial enters its second 
quarter century. Outside of bookish circles this fact will 
not seem as worthy of note as it will within. But where- 
ever in America there is any care for the maintenance or 
development of sound and disinterested literary criticism 
there will be gratification that The Dial has not only 
survived so long "the tumult and the shouting," but 
enters auspiciously upon a fresh stage of its career of 
usefulness. . . . It is pleasant to consider that the only 
magazine wholly given to literary criticism and quite 
independent of any publishing concern was founded in 
Chicago, and has been maintained here for twenty-five 
years. During that period it has made its way wherever 
competent and disinterested criticism is sought. 

(From a column article in Chicago Evening Post.) 

Twenty-five years ago, on the first day of May, The 
Dial was founded in Chicago, and now it is celebrating 
its Quarter Century. The editorial on the occasion speaks 
with becoming pride of the career of the paper. Indeed, 
that a purely literary magazine should remain for so long 
a time under the management of the man who created it, 
that it should always stand for the better things in litera- 
ture, and that it should now be prosperous, is a record as 
honorable as it is rare. New York Evening Post. 

All friends of whatsoever things are best in the litera- 
ture of this generation will note with interest that The 
Dial celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary with the issue 
of May I. Throughout the last quarter of a century this 
purely critical literary magazine, published in the intensely 
commercial city of Chicago, has steadfastly held to the 
high aim with which it was founded, gaining for itself an 
undisputed place among the best critical journals in the 
world. Chicago Record-Herald. 

Of more than passing note among newspaper jubilees 
is the quarter century attained on May Day by The Dial, 
the journal of literary criticism whose place of publication 
is Chicago, but whose reading public is scattered over the 
length and breadth of the land, and also across the seas 
in other lands than our own. . . . Curiously enough, to 
this day The Dial is the only paper in the United States 
devoted exclusively to literary criticism. Furthermore, 
it is the only literary periodical in the country which is 
not owned or controlled by a book publishing house. 
Therefore it stands on an eminence of dignified solitude 
that has always helped to give to its judgments the excep- 
tional value that is recognized as belonging to them by 
all in touch with American literature. . . . We extend 
cordial congratulations to our contemporary on the com- 
pletion of a full quarter century of honorable service. 
May the hands of The Dial always keep steadily moving, 
may it continue to ring out the hours of literary achieve- 
ment with resonant chime, and may the wheels behind 
the clock face be always well oiled, as heretofore, with 
the unguents of sound wisdom, clear discernment, and 
sober judgment. Los Angeles Times. 

The Dial of Chicago has just celebrated its twenty- 
fifth anniversary. It is an unusual record of which the 
editor, Mr. Francis F. Browne, writes modestly in the 
anniversary number, recalling his own unbroken editor- 
ship from the first number. The service which a literary 
paper of such high ideals and persistent courage In main- 
taining them has been able to render in the formative 
period of the Interior deserves wide recognition. 

The Congregationalist (Boston).

A PUBLISHER'S CONFESSIONS. 



Confession is good for the sonl, as the old 
•saying has it, and whoever first formulated that 
familiar dictum doubtless meant that the soul 
of the confessor was the one to get the benefit. 
But the writer of 'A Publisher's Confession/ 
an entertaining little book recently published, 
knows a trick worth two of that, and his con- 
fessions turn out to be counsels for the admo- 
nition of others rather than the humble setting 
forth of his own shortcomings. To chasten 
man}- souls with the same rod is obviously a 
worthier object of endeavor than selfishly to con- 
fine the discipline to the simple case of the 
writer himself. 

The first concern of the book is with the 
greedy souls of those authors who undermine the 
financial foundations of the publishing business 
by their unscrupulous demands for large royal- 
ties. The number of these inconsiderate scrib- 
blers who refuse to accept with due gratitude 
the traditional ten per cent is yearly increasing, 
and there is a progressive augmentation in the 
audacity of their stipulations. The average 
author has always found it diflficult to under- 
stand the equity of leaving the other ninety per 
cent in the hands of his publisher. This ninety 
per cent is, of course, a purely imaginary quan- 
tity (since nearly half of it disappears in the cus- 
tomary discount exacted from the publisher by 
the bookseller). There remains then, on the 
basis of the ten per cent royalty, rather less than 
fifty per cent for all the preliminary expenses of 
type-setting, stereotj'ping, and advertising, and 
for all the continuous expenses of manufacture 
and marketing. It is obvious enough that a 
book must sell to the extent of something like 
two thousand copies to pay expenses alone, and 
that if the publisher is to get any profit at all, 
it must come from the sale of a large edition. 
The writer of the present ' confession ' presents 
these elementary facts in a convincing manner, 
and his argument needs no strengthening. 

There are, however, a few points to be made 
on the authors behalf, which this argument 
ignores. For the book of moderate sale, respect- 
ably manufactured and properly advertised, the 
ten per cent royalty is undoubtedly a fair bar- 
gain for the author. But for the book of very 
large sale, a twenty per cent royalty would not 
be unfair to the publisher and not unduly gen- 
erous to the author. The problem is, of course. 



876 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



to form some idea before a book is published 
of the sale that may reasonaibly be expected for 
it. In our opinion, the sliding scale of royalties 
offers the most practically equitable way of deal- 
ing with this uncertain element in a publishing 
venture. The speculative element in most such 
ventures cannot be eliminated, and it is only 
fitting that the benefits of an unexpected suc- 
cess should inure to both parties. The 
fact that the publisher finds it unwise, 
and even ruinous, to contract for large royalty 
payments before the salability of a book has been 
tested does not conflict with the other fact that 
it is unjust to an author to limit his rewards by 
a forecast that the event may show to have been 
unnecessarily conservative. 

A matter of minor importance, but not one 
to be neglected altogether, is found in the sales, 
not inconsiderable in amount, which every pub- 
lisher makes direct to the individual book-buyer. 
The profit resulting from these sales must 
widen materially the narrow margin upon which 
his business with the trade is admittedly done. 
One other point we have emphasized upon sev- 
eral former occasions. It is that books published 
under the ' net ' system call for a special rule 
on the subject of royalty. To give the author of 
a 'net' book the traditional ten per cent is 
equivalent to depriving him of one-fifth of his 
legitimate reward. But we have seen no evi- 
dence since the inauguration of ' net ' prices for 
books that authors' royalties upon these publi- 
cations have been advanced as they should have 
been. Not to make this advance spontaneously 
and as a matter of the barest justice is to take 
an underhanded advantage of a class of persons 
not as a rule well equipped for business dealings. 

One of the most salient features of our little 
book of confessions is the emphasis which it 
places upon professional, as distinguished from 
commercial, publication. The root of this impor- 
tant matter is found in the following passage: 

'It was once a matter of honor that one pub- 
lisher should respect the relation established be- 
tween another publisher and a writer, as a physician 
respects the relation established between another 
physician and a patient. Three or four of the best 
publishing houses still live and work by this code. 
And they have the respect of all the book world. 
Authors and readers, who do not know definitely 
why they hold them in esteem, discern a high 
sense of honor and conduct in them. Character 
makes its way from any man who has it down a 
long line — everybody who touches a sterling char- 
acter comes at last to feel it both in conduct and 
in product. The very best traditions of publishing 
are yet a part of the practice of the best American 
publishing houses, which are conducted by men of 
real character. But there are others — others who 
keep "literary drummers," men who go to see 
popular writers and solicit books. The authors of 
very popular books themselves also — some of them 
at least — put themselves up at auction, going from 
publisher to publisher or threatening to go. This 



is demoralization and commercialization with a 
vengeance. But it is the sin of the authors.' 

Here is an issue squarely presented, and it 
is one of the greatest importance. Shall pub- 
lishers underbid each other in the effort to add 
popular names to their lists? Shall authors 
hawk their wares from house to house for the 
purpose of getting a number of offers and 
accepting the highest of them ? If we change the 
terms of these questions, substituting ' physi- 
cian '* or ' lawyer ' in the one case, and ' patient ' 
or ' client ' in the other, they will be very 
promptly answered in the negative. It 
seems to us that insistence upon a profes- 
sional relation between publisher and author is 
absolutely necessary if the complex process of 
writing and uttering books is to be kept upon a 
dignified plane, and the best intellectual inter- 
ests of the country are to be served. 
Commercial methods may do well enough for 
the publication of the cheap rubbish that still, 
as in all past time, is produced for the infection 
of the public taste — just as the department 
store is a fitting place for its sale — but books 
that have anything to do with literature or with 
the advancement of knowledge should not be 
subjected to such degrading conditions of pro- 
duction. 

The plea of our anonymous author for the 
ethics of professionalism in the publishing busi- 
ness is so reasonable and so convincingly urged 
that little ground is left for any opposing argu- 
ment. And yet there runs through this little 
book a line of thought, perhaps rather a line of 
suggestion, that is strikingly at variance with 
the main tenor of the discourse. We refer to the 
slighting and even contemptuous language with 
which the writer speaks of those who apply 
critical standards to literature. A few quota- 
tions will illustrate this curious bias, the ex- 
pression of which is almost tantamount to the 
rejection of the fine ideals for which the writer 
elsewhere seems to stand. At an early oppor- 
tunity, he takes occasion to make the reckless 
pronouncement : ' I, for one, and I know no 
publisher who holds a different opinion, care 
nothing for the judgment of the professional 
literary class. ' Later on, we find such sayings 
as these : ' The one thing that is certain is that 
the critical crew and the academic faculty are 
sure not to recognize literature at first sight. ^ 
' Most publishers' readers are literarv' folk, pure 
and simple. ' If you have a book to publish, 
first find out who conducts the business of the 
publisher you have in mind. ' If it is conducted 
by a lot of hired literar}- men, avoid it. They 
are, most of them, men who have failed at 
authorship; they read and advise for salaries; 
and most of them know nothing about the

Expressions like these betray a curious lack 
of balance ; they suggest the man -vrith a griev- 
ance, who lets his temper get the better of his 
judgment. And the animus becomes still more 
marked when any reference is made to the * liter- 
ary' journals.' We are told that when some 
worthless novel is made ephemeraUy popular by 
the * brass band method ' of the sensational pub- 
lisher, these journals ' forthwith fall to gossip- 
ing, and keep up a chatter about great sellers, 
and bewail commercialization in literature.' Fur- 
thermore, we read of ' nonsense such as review- 
ers write in the literary magazines,' and of * oui 
shallow gabble called reviews.' We are also 
gravely assured that publishers rarely waste their 
time in reading the reviews of their own pub- 
lications, and that periodicals which ' go only to 
the literary class are to a degree superfluous' 
for advertising purposes. There is no mistaking 
the spirit of such words as these ; it is the spirit 
of the very commercialism which the writer else- 
where deprecates, and it serves to weaken his 
main plea immeasurably. If all ' literary ' opin- 
ion is to be held thus in contempt, what sort of 
opinion, we ask in our bewilderment, does out 
confessing publisher consider deserving of 
respect ? If the judgment of expert criticism is 
to go unheeded, what judgment is there left for 
his guidance, save that of the philistine with 
his commercial aims and his worship of mere 
success? The dilemma is thus squarely pre- 
sented, but our writer seems to seize first one 
horn and then the other, instead of boldly mak- 
ing his choice once for all. 

For our own part, there is no difficulty at all 
in making the choice. The publisher who does 
not rest his ventures upon a sound basis of 
literary judgment, and with whom the approval 
of expert opinion does not count for more than 
the gains resulting from a meretricious popu- 
larity, is not a publisher at all in the higher 
sense of the term. He is at the best a trades- 
man, at the worst a ' quack ' or a * shyster.' He 
can probably make more money by catering to 
vulgarized tastes than by appealing to refined 
intelligences, but in adopting this course, he sac- 
rifices every claim to the respect of those whose 
respect is worth having. That the writer of the 
little book now under our consideration is to 
be reckoned among those who would justify this 
sordid type of publishing by the magnitude of 
its unholy rewards we do not for a moment sup- 
pose. But we cannot help feeling that he has 
allowed himself to indulge in certain vagaries 
of expression that, logically developed, would 
lead to so unfortunate a conclusion. His real 
ideal, however, we believe to be contained in the 
following passage : 

'As nearly as I can make out the publishing 
houses in the Tnited States that are conducted as 



dignified institutions are conducted with as little 
degrading commercialism as the old houses whose 
history has become a part of English literature, 
and I believe that they are conducted with more 
ability. Centainly not one of them has made a 
colossal fortune. Certainly not one of them ever 
failed to recognize or to encourage a high literary 
purpose if it were sanely directed. Every one of 
them every year invests in books and authors that 
they know cannot yield a direct or immediate profit, 
and they make these investments because they feel 
consoled by trying to do a service to literature.' 

We have little doubt that an investigation into 
the motives and guiding principles of the houses 
thus held up to honor would disclose the fact 
that their very genuine success has resulted from 
a constant deference to those very literary stand- 
ards that are made the object of our writer's 
ill-advised and immerited scorn. 



TEE DECAY OF THE GHOST IN 
FICTION. 



' For one, I cannot purge my raind of tbat forlorn 
faith.' — Andrew Lakg. 

For approximately a generation, the ghost 
has been missing from fiction ; after a disappear- 
ance so sudden and of such far-reaching implica- 
tions that it is a matter of some amazement that 
those who profess to concern themselves with 
the phenomena of imaginative literature should 
have paid so little attention to it. It is a com- 
monplace that ever since literature began, as well 
as considerably before that interesting period, 
what we call Hhe supernatural' has been a 
staple material of the tellers of tales. As there 
has always been a literature of love, so there ha^ 
always been a literature of fear; and until the 
development of the present narrow and timorous 
popular taste, one had perhaps as strong an 
appeal as the other. Ghosts in their most literal 
acceptation — not as the more or less imper- 
sonal shades we have sometimes indifferently 
pictured them — have always been held an essen- 
tial complement of tangible everyday life, inex- 
tricably bound up with religion, with love for 
the dead, with hunger for the unknown, with 
many of the most intimate and profound emo- 
tions : and their literary use has seemed, to the 
greater public, not only no less, but even more 
* realistic,' than the modem exploitation of the 
commonplace. 

Twenty-five years ago, even, the reader of 
ma^zine fiction was still able to shudder to his 
heart's content. Spectres glided with the pre- 
cision of long-established custom through the 
pages of the more conventional compendiums of 
light literature. The familiar paraphernalia of 
supernatural incident, — draughty chambers, 
tempestuous nights, blood-staans, wan-faced 
women, — were still in constant and elaborate

requisition. And while there was a discreet drib- 
bling of phantoms from week to week or from 
month to month, a magnificent convocation of 
the spectral tribe occurred annually. That is 
to say, a curious association of ideas connected 
the maximum of ghostly prevalence with Christ- 
mas, the season of popular rejoicing; and by 
way of making sure of these dismal but doubt- 
less salutary companions, it was customary, as 
Mir. Anstey once remarked, ^ to commission a 
band of ingenious litterateurs to turn out 
batches of ready-made spectres for the Christ- 
mas annuals.' The business of chilling the 
popular spine was taken with due seriousness 
and was all the more effectually brought about 
in that the ' magazine ghost,' as this source of 
popular refreshment was termed, was as stereo- 
typed and conventional as the old-fashioned 
novel-heroine. Its looks, manner, haunts, com- 
panions, and alleged errands were those long 
since laid down by tradition ; it evinced no sen- 
sational modern unexpectedness. 

But suddenly, and it must surely have seemed 
mysteriously, the magazine ghost vanished; nor 
were its eerie footprints traced. Whether by a 
concerted action of magazine editors, or by a 
swift and complete paralysis of the contributor^' 
imaginations, or by a profound alteration of 
popular sentiment, or by the operation of a prin- 
ciple presently to be suggested, the literature of 
the supernatural ceased to be produced. Can 
this have happened without protest, without 
comment, even? The subject is rich in its pos- 
sibilities of speculation. For if the acceptance 
and enjoyment of ghost-lore imDly a childish 
quality of mind, as one sometimes hears supe- 
rior persons assert, then our rejection of them 
would argue that we are the wisest generation 
that ever lived. If, again, the reading or writ- 
ing of such tales demand a freshness of imagina- 
tion that in our little day has become desiccated, 
then our plight is pitiable indeed. 

There is at hand, of course, an easy but super- 
ficial explanation to the effect that a prevalence 
of ghost-stories must depend upon a stout popu- 
lar belief in ghosts; and that having lost the one, 
we must forego the other. The slightest reflec- 
tion shows that this position is untenable. Not 
believe in ghosts ? We believe in them with all 
our hearts. Never before, since spectral feet 
first crossed a man-made threshold, have ghosts 
been so squarely, openly, and enthusiastically 
believed in, so assiduously cultivated, as now. 
We have raised ghost-lore to the dusty dignity of 
a science. The invocation of the spirits of the 
dead, far from having its former suggestion of 
vulgar myster}^, is one of the most reputable of 
practices, which men of learning carry on pub- 
licly, with stenograpliers conveniently at hand. 
There even flourishes a ' Haunted House Com- 



mittee,' appointed and maintained by the fore- 
most society for the promotion of ghosts, and 
this for the express purpose of encouraging the 
presence of the shyer and less aggressive spectres 
in what seem their appropriate habitations, — 
of making them, as it were, feel at home. We 
believe in ghosts as sincerely as we believe in 
the very poor; and in similar fashion we en- 
deavor to live among them, establish a cordial 
understanding, and write about them in 
our notebooks. Nor do we believe in them 
the less because, when on our learned 
behavior, we may refer to them as ' phan- 
tasmogenetic agencies.' Not believe in ghosts? 
They are our fetish. Let it never be imagined 
that ghost-stories have suffered decline because 
of our indifference to their subject-matter, 
' material ' though our age is commonly held to 
be. By our very zest in their pursuit, we have 
possibly proved the reverse of Scott's mistaken 
theory that to see ghosts it is only necessary to 
believe in them, — to wish to see. Much truer is 
the proposition that the seer of ghosts commonly 
does not premeditate his vision; that spectres 
manifest themselves by preference to ' unimag- 
inative people in perfect health.' 

No small share of the fascination exerted by 
the ancient and outgrown ghost of fiction was 
due to its invariable and satisfactory conformity 
to type. However frequent its intrusion, or how- 
ever familiar, it was never suffered to deviate 
from its character, so deeply rooted in human 
consciousness, as a source of dread. It was the 
function of the ghost to be consistently unpleas- 
ant, and that function was relentlessly fulfilled. 
No one personal characteristic of the ghost as 
we Icnow it in song or story or as we learn from 
the unimpeachable testimony of our friends' 
friends, can explain its unequalled power to 
arouse the emotion of fear. Distasteful as is the 
ghostly habit of reducing its unfleshly essence 
to a threadlike, infinitely ductile filament — like 
a bit of transsubstantial chewing-gum — in 
order sneakily to penetrate keyholes ; disturbing 
as is its fashion of upsetting our gravely accepted 
laws of nature' ; intolerable as is its lack of vocal 
organs (for phantoms, with few exceptions, can- 
not or will not speak) ; — neither one nor all of 
these undesirable characteristics can completely 
solve the interesting riddle of its fear-compelling 
power. And it is undoubtedly almost as remark- 
able that having for centuries, in and out of 
fiction, maintained this consistent and extreme- 
ly prevalent personality, the ghost should have 
dropped out of literature altogether. Now, how 
can this have been? 

To go as far back as the early English folk- 
tales and ballads, when the wherefore of phan- 
toms was even better understood than now, and 
when fiction more essentially took its origin 



1905.] 



THE DIAL 



379 



from life, ghost-tales gained their grim effective- 
ness from the accuracy with \rhich they reflected 
popular belief. The audiences of that simple 
day had not attained a sufficient refinement of 
imagination to delight in vague, casual, inco- 
herent spectres; every ghost had a name and 
date. What is more important is that there was 
no ghost that had not a reason for being. The 
ingenious notion that the spirits of the dead re- 
turn from an allegedly peaceful Elysium simply 
to make themselves disagreeable, by way of eat- 
ing their minds, had not yet suggested itself. 
On the contrary, the animistic trend of popular 
thought, which of course greatly favored the. ap- 
pearance of ghosts in general, assigned them 
likewise adequate and intelligible motives, 
among the chief of which were : to reveal treas- 
ure, to reunite happy lovers, to avenge a crime, 
and to serve as * a primitive telegraphic service 
for the conveyance of bad news.' Ghosts were 
therefore not only the recognizable shades of 
the familiarly known dead; they were sinister 
symbols of crime, remorse, vengeance. If you 
shuddered at sight of them, it was for a better 
reason than weak nerves. Horror was not piled 
on horror, in early ghost-tales, merely to satisfy 
the artist's own sense of cumulative effect. Each 
detail had a powerful conventional significance, 
and the consequent power to arouse a strong 
primitive emotion. This system not only lent 
an artistic strength and symmetry to the early 
literature; it was intensely satisfactory to the 
Anglo-Saxon mind. 

But . inevitably, when the motives and the 
language of literature became more complex, the 
rationale of ghost-lore became affected. Phan- 
toms began to lose their original force, fell into 
the habit of haunting from motives relatively 
unworthy. Evidences multiplied of their degen- 
eration into a morbid and meddlesome tribe, 
with a sadly diminished sense of the fitting and 
the picturesque. Their visits were even con- 
cerned with the payment of debts, of strictly 
mortal contraction; and thev lamentably lost 
caste by exhibiting themselves as the victims, 
rather than as the scourge, of conscience. A 
ghost has been known to go to the trouble of 
haunting a house for the mere purpose of ensur- 
ing the payment of a shilling, — an episode that 
might well permanently compromise the dig- 
nity of the entire spectral tribe. Likewise when 
they acquired the intrusive habit of giving evi- 
dence in trials, the original and forceful idea that 
ghosts were agents of retribution became se- 
riously coarsened. Legally, the fact that the 
issue of many an actual trial has hinged on 
ghostly testimony is of extraordinary interest. 
So far as imaginative terror-literature is con- 
cerned, however, the introduction of this matter 
serves as a mixed and weakened motive, only. 



During the later years of the ghosf s popu- 
larity in literature, it will readily be seen that 
the greater number of the earliest ghost-motives 
were outgrown. It is some time, for instance, 
since the motive of recovering buried treasure 
through supernatural aid has been able to 
' csxry,' the custom of burying treasure having 
itself somewhat tamely died out. Far more in- 
congruous, even, came to seem the supernatural 
reunion of lovers, as in the familiar case where 
the posthumous suitor reappears to bear his still 
living sweetheart back to the grave with him- 
Ghosts that are to be imderstood as the projec- 
tions of the spirit at the moment of deatii hsLve 
always been popular, it is true, but this motive 
is not in itself strong or picturesque enough to 
serve as the backbone of a corporate section of 
imaginative literature. 

In short, the only ghost-motive that retained 
its strength, plausibility, and appeal to the 
Anglo-Saxon mind was the retribution-motive, 
— the idea that the ghosf s function was to re- 
call, expiate, or avenge a crime. This was im- 
pressive; it was terrifying; it had moral and 
religious significance ; it was not subtle ; it was 
susceptible of indefinitely repeated adjustment to 
time and place. It was the perfect, periiaps the 
only perfect, ghost-motive for English literature. 
So valorous is the Anglo-Saxon temper that it 
Booms or is ashamed to tremble at mere empty 
shadow-tales. It demands not only to be im- 
pressed ; there must be an adequate basis for the 
impression. The clue to the whole matter is 
that the ghost must not be a wanton and irre- 
sponsible power. It must be a moral agent. 

Unfortunately, the realization of tiiis simple 
truth has never been complete. Only subcon- 
sciously has the public known what it wanted. 
As for the tellers of tales, they seem, in those 
latter days of the ghost's Hterary existence, to 
have remained in criminal ignorance of the vital 
principle of their business. The decay of the 
ghost in fiction occurred, not through any loss 
of human interest in the spectral world, but 
through an indolent misapprehension, on the 
port of the story-tellers, of the real character of 
the ghost as we Anglo-Saxons have conceived it. 
Thus it came about that the ghost, previous to 
its subsidence, was, as Mr. Lang truly observed, 
'a purposeless creature. He appears, nobody 
knows why; he has no message to deliver, no 
secret crime to conceal, no appointment to keep, 
no treasure to disclose, no commissions to be 
executed, and, as an almost invariable rule, he 
does not speak, even if you speak to him.' And 
he adds that inquirers have therefore concluded 
that the ghost, generically, is ' not all there,' — 
a dreary result of scepticism, indeed ! At the 
same time, what direct and utilitarian folk could 
put up with a confirmedly inconsequent ghost.

even for the creepy fascination of shuddering at 
his phantom footfall ? And could there be, on 
the whole, a more perfect example of the opera- 
tion of natural selection in art than that, the 
ghost of fiction becoming unmoral, superficial, 
and flabby, it was its pitilessly appropriate 
penalty to be dropped and apparently forgotten ? 
A small group of kindred volumes, which 
have appeared during the past year or so, now 
for the first time indicate that a perception of 
the true nature of the literary ghost is returning 
to the absent-minded craft. Stevenson ha'd, it 
is true, an admirable perception of the terror- 
inspiring, and he did not make the mistake of 
being vague; but his was not the temperament 
that produces the perfect ghost-story. Mr. 
Henry James, in that masterpiece, * The Turn 
of the Screw,' has shown that he can convey a 
sense of mystery and terror more skilfully than 
any of his contemporaries ; but his work is prob- 
ably too esoteric to stand as typical, and it re- 
mains true that the pattern ghost-tale must be 
writ large and obvious. If, as now appears, a half- 
dozen of the ablest writers of the day are realiz- 
ing this, there is hope for the renaissance of the 
literary ghost. It has already been proved that 
the problem of its readjustment to our literature 
is not insuperable, — that the chambers of our 
untenanted imaginations stand ready and wait- 
ing to be haunted by wraiths that our logic can 
approve. There may indeed develop with time 
a regenerated ghost-literature well worth ac- 
quaintance ; for, as an essayist of other times has 
somewhat grandiloquently observed, ' Our in- 
born proneness to a love of the marvellous and 
unimaginable, which has originated in our im- 
perfect acquaintance with the laws of nature and 
our own being, does not appear to suffer diminu- 
tion las education and culture advance; for it is 
found to coexist with the highest intellectual 
development and the most refined critical ioia-

Nehemiah How, a native of Massachusetts, was 
captured by the Indians in 1745, near the site of 
Putney, Vermont, and was carried to Quebec, where 
he was imprisoned with many other British colon-

War. After an imprisonment of eight months, he 
died of a contagious fever, which also carried off 
many of his fellow-prisoners. The diary which 
How kept while a prisoner of war was printed ii

the alliance between French and Indians during the 
American colonial wars and on the official life of 
the French at Quebec, the capital of New France.

In Garden and Orchard.* 



More and more do our amateur gardeners 
commit to paper what they have learned by 
experience, observation, and reading, and what 
they have dreamed as they worked. They are 
moved possibly by the joy and help they have 
themselves found in similar works of other writ- 
ers, or perhaps they are stirred by that renais- 
sance of garden literature in recent years which 
has been accompanied by a truer knowledge of 
gardening as a science and a keener insight into 
its possibilities as an art. The earlier books 
were nearly all English, although scattered pub- 
lications like Celia Thaxter's charming little 
volume, 'An Island Garden,' go to show that 
not all the gardening done on this side was of the 
' bedding plants ' variety that has lately received 
so many hard words, and that not all the 
owners of garden plots turned them over to the 
'hired man' for cultivation and decoration. 
Now, indeed, the books on this justly popular 
subject come so thick and fast that beginners 
hardly know where to turn, and even the experi- 
enced are embarrassed by the riches for their 
choosing, — whether they are looking for practi- 
cal advice or for the sympathetic ramblings of 
other garden lovers like themselves. But the 
true gardener is not to be deterred by quantity, 
or even by quality ; for it is a fact that no mat- 
ter how simple or commonplace or amateurish 
a garden book may be, there is rarely one that 
does not contain some interesting facts or com- 
ments before unthought-of by the reader. More- 
over, the true gardener is just as eager to read 
and criticise the latest advice and comments 
about the plants he knows by heart as he is to 
study the annual seed-catalogues when they first 
appear — and the latter state of mind is pro- 
verbial. 

Most imposing of the garden books that have 
lately appeared is an English collaborated pro- 
duction entitled ' Garden Colour.' This is one 
of the large octavo volumes, with colored repro- 
ductions from paintings, that have been 
imported from England to so considerable an 
extent during the past year or two. Its thick

paper, broad margins, and fifty-one colored 
plates seem to mark it as a book for ornament 
only; but the contents are extremely practical, 
and nearly every picture illustrates some point 
in the text. These pictures, which are from 
water-colors by Miss Margaret Waterfield (who 
also supplies the greater part of the text), 
require a few words of caution. To one seeking 
for the beauties of individual flowers they wiU 
prove only disappointing, for that it is neither 
their purpose nor their effect to depict. They 
were painted to show what combinations of 
color will make the garden itself a series of 
pictures, and as such they are a success. They 
should not be viewed at too close a range, or by 
an artificial light. But one who has considered 
the subject only casually will certainly get some 
inspiring suggestions from both pictures and 
text. A few of the most attractive of the plates 
are the frontispiece, showing purple Clematis 
climbing over an open iron gate, with Tritoma 
and Michaelmas Daisies in the foreground ; those 
of Anemone Blanda and Daffodil Cemuus, of 
Oriental Poppy and Lupin, of Delphiniums, 
Lilies, and Poppies, of Cluster Rose, of Fox- 
gloves and Rose Euphrosyne, of a border of 
annuals, of Tropaeollum Speciosum, and of Mi- 
chaelmas Daisies alone. Many of these were 
painted from the artist's own garden at Xack- 
ington, Canterbury. Miss Waterfield herself 
writes the garden notes for the various months, 
giving advice in regard to cultivation only inci- 
dentgiUy, but chiefly in regard to artistic 
arrangement, — those methods of planting 
whereby each plant or shrub shows its own beau- 
ties to best advantage, while at the same time 
enhancing those of its neighbors. It is true that 
most English books are of little practical use to 
American gardeners, but the very lack of cul- 
tural directions makes this volume an exception 
to the rule. For it is the principles rather than 
the actual facts that the various writers wish 
in this case to enforce. Miss TTaterfield's col- 
laborators include Mrs. C. W. Earle, Miss Rose 
Kingsley, and other well-known English garden 
lovers and writers. 

Mrs. Helena Rutherfurd Ely won so many 
friends two years ago by her volume entitled 
*A Woman's Hardy Garden,' which united in 
a most delightful manner the serious and the 
pleasant sides of garden work and lore, that it 
is no surprise to find she has been encouraged 
to prepare a sequel, which we now have in * An- 
other Hardy Garden Book.' In the later book, 
however, Mrs. Ely has not confined herself to 
the flower garden, but has rather laid emphasis 
upon the material side of the subject, — perhaps 
with a view to reaching masculine readers, for 
she says : * I do not remember a single instance 
of showing the flowers to a man who failed to 



inquire with a strong note of interest about the 
vegetable garden,' She remarks, besides, that 
on the woman's part 'the raising of vegetables 
is often a propitiatory offering to the other mem- 
bers of the family.' However, after the prac- 
tical-minded man has read the chapters on vege- 
tables, fruits, and trees, there still remains for 
the woman who gardens only for beauty about 
half the book, giving additional suggestions in 
regard to perennials and other flowers, * A Gar- 
den of Lilies and Iris,' and special spring and 
autumn work in the flower garden. Mrs. Ely 
is always interesting because of the close per- 
sonal note in what she writes. Yet she does not 
overdo this note: her books are far from being 
sentimental, but are infused with a very vigor- 
ous personality, and with occasional touches of 
humor that prove she is not taking herself too 
seriously. She seldom pauses to rhapsodize, 
being more concerned with the possibility of 
helping others to get as much joy from a life 
out-of-doors as she does herself. Nor does she 
forget that the greater number of home gardens 
are on a much smaller scale than hers, and so 
gives her advice in such a way that it is easily 
adaptable to other places and circumstances. 

Still more utilitarian than Mrs. Ely's book is 
Mr. E. P. Powell's * Orchard and Fruit Garden,' 
which appears in the new ' Coimtry Home 
Library.' Mr. Powell's purpose is to instruct, 
not to amuse ; he is deeply in earnest, and seeks 
to make possible delicious food and financial 
success for the men and women whom he has 
in a previous volume so ardently urged to make 
a home, however small, in the country. The 
greater part of the book is taken up by advice 
as to the best varieties of fruit to plant, ranging 
from apples to small fruits and including some 
Uttle-grown fruits and some nut-trees. The 
usual order is reversed here, for after this long 
dissertation on kinds of fruit, there follow a 
few chapters on culture, training, packing, and 
marketing. Our chief criticism on Mr. Powell's 
book would be that in these last sections he gives 
ear to too many other advisers. For beginners, 
as so many of his readers will be, this is sure to 
prove confusing. One method, forcibly put, is 
worth a half-dozen from which to choose, even 
though they all have their value. In the main, 
however, it is evident that Mr. Powell knows his 
subject, as indeed we might expect, since it is 
imderstood that he is a prize fruit-grower of 
New York state, and has had orchard experience 
in Michigan and Missouri as well. This latter 
fact insures the reader against that onesided- 
ness which is so exasperating in many of those 
writers who deal only with * the northeastern 
United States.' The chief charm of Mr. Powell's 
book, soberly written as it is, is the author's 
manifest enthusiasm, his deep absorption in his 



882

subject. He is at once conservative and pro- 
gressive, and has given us a book valuable to 
have at hand. A serious defect, however, is the 
lack of an index ; few indeed are the books that 
can keep rank nowadays without a good index. 

Altogether bright and clever is Mrs. Edith 
Loring Fullerton's ' How to Make a Vegetable 
Garden.^ The writer has managed to avoid 
everything dull and prosy, without omitting 
anything essential, and so readable is the book 
that the veriest ignoramus cannot fail to under- 
stand and the most hardened opposer of garden 
labor must be tempted to 'have a try.' And 
the illustrations ! — truly, they illustrate, — 
everything from seedlings and tools to the aspect 
of the garden in winter. Mrs. Fullerton does 
not relegate the vegetable garden to the tender 
mercies of men, — at least not all parts of it. 
She is as much at home there as in the flower 
garden, and as fully determined to make it beau- 
tiful. Indeed, she constantly recurs to the idea 
of the 'vegetable flower garden,' and describes 
particularly a Japanese radial vegetable garden, 
which combines use and beauty. She is fertile 
in helpful devices for all purposes, and her book 
ig likely therefore to be a boon to the amateur. 
After several chapters of general advice, she 
devotes herself to special vegetables, telling not 
only how to grow and keep them, but how to 
serve them as well, thereby earning the special 
gratitude of the housewife. She has included 
the small fruits generally raised in a home gar- 
den, and has capped her beneficences by a com- 
plete and very helpful planting-table. Those 
who are readers of ' Country Life in America ' 
and ' The Garden Magazine ' will recognize 
some portions of this book; but its value is by 
no means decreased thereby, and at any rate 
the most entertaining parts are new. 

The last book on our list, Mrs. Sarah "Warner 
Brooks's 'A Garden with House Attached,' is a 
rather thin volume of reminiscence, meditations, 
and garnered scraps of information about 
flowers, mingled with garden lore gained by 
personal experience. The writer is not alto- 
gether modem in her tastes, and the chapters 
have an old-time flavor in spite of their evident 
current knowledge. The style is somewhat dif- 
fuse and parenthetical, except where direct ad- 
vice is given, in which case it is clear enough. 
The practical portion includes a chapter on house 
plants (a paper delivered before the ' Cambridge 
Plant Club' and published in 'The American 
Garden'), chapters on perennials, roses, bulbs, 
annuals, climbers, and herbs. An interesting 
chapter consists of gathered items on the cere- 
bral processes of plants as shown in their move- 
ments toward light, food, and support, — a sub- 
ject of charm and mystery concerning which we 
yet have much to learn. It was an old garden 



in Massachusetts that furnished the founda- 
tion for Mrs. Brooks's experiments and improve- 
ments, mingling the old with the new, destroy- 
ing or adding, as the spirit moved her. It was a 
gracious task, and one from which she evidently 
reaped much joy. So there we will leave her, 
with the feeling we all should have in a garden 
of beauty, 'attuned to the blessed influences of 
the hour, at peace with all mankind.'

Wanderers ts Many Laxds.* 



' The Other Side of the Lantern,' by Sir Fred- 
erick Treves, Sergeant- Surgeon to H. B. M. 
Edward VII., more than justifies its sub-title 
as being 'an account of a commonplace tour 
round the world.' The route was usual enough 
— the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Bed 
Sea, and India, British China, and Japan. The 
return was across the Pacific Ocean and the 
American continent, but Sir Frederick found 
Hawaii — he calls it the Sandwich Islands, with 
fine British conservatism — and the Yosemite 
Valley and the Grand Canon of the Colorado the 
only scenes under the American flag worthy of 
his pen. But the point of view is that of a cul- 
tivated man of the world who is able to set his 
impressions down in excellent English, and the 
result is thoroughly reada;ble. India was gor- 
geously resplendent to the eye of this traveller, 
but it is Japan that holds his attention longest. 
The following story relates to a scene at the 
shrine of Bunzuru, the Japanese god of healing : 

'A wizened peasant from the country 
seemed to have travelled far, for there was a dazed 
look in his face. He led by the hand a boy, whom 
I supposed to be his grandson, and who was suffer- 
ing from wide-spread ringworm of the scalp. It is

probable that the learned in the village had 
wrought their best upon the lad's head, but with- 
out effect, for the malady is obstinate. The old 
man had evidently journeyed to Kyoto to seek the 
aid of the famous healer of Kiyomizu. He rubbed 
the bare wood on Binzuru's head vigorously, and 
then he rubbed the boy's head until he giggled. 
He repeated this ritual many times, and then left 
with great faith in his heart. 

'The next applicant was a worried woman bring- 
ing with her a bald-headed boy who was evidently 
mentally deficient. I think she hoped to convey 
to her son's brain some of that bright sense and 
that power of learning which dwelt beneath the 
brow of the patient divinity. She rubbed the two 
heads, one after the other — with even more ardor 
than the peasant had displayed. The boy laughed 
uproariously, but the mother was very grave. 
Whether in the course of days a brighter intelli- 
gence dawned in the lad's dull eyes I know not; 
but I have little doubt that in its appointed time 
ringworm appeared upon his scalp. Women are 
patient; still there is trouble in the learning that 
the growth of a parasite outside the skull is no 
cure for a lack of activity within.' 

Sir Frederick was privileged to meet two 
rulers on his journey, the Mikado of Japan and 
the President of the United States. Though far 
too long to be reproduced here, his contrasted 
impressions of these two men are assuredly 
worth careful reading. Especially valuable at 
this moment is the following statement regard- 
ing one of the vital questions of the day : 

'The visitor to China is likely to make early 
enquiry from prominent European residents in the 
matter of the "Yellow Peril". It will be with 
some disappointment that he learns that the 
"Yellow Peril" does not exist. The Chinese have 
no desire to spread themselves over foreign lands 
in devastating hordes like the Goths and the Huns. 
They are fired by no desire for conquest, nor for 
new territory. The wish dearest to their hearts 
is to be let alone. The cry of the people is "China 
for the Chinese", and the extreme bitterness of 
this cry has led from time to time to trouble, in the 
form of risings, riots, and indiscriminate murder. 
On each of these occasions the Chinese worm has 
turned, and turned unpleasantly. . . . The 
prayer of the Chinaman is for peace, not for power 
to run riot over the earth; for remunerative work, 
and not for the privilege of filling the dramatic 
part of a Peril, yellow or otherwise.' 

The author's photographs taken on the journey 
have been reproduced by his publishers with un- 
usual delicacy. 

It is difficult to do justice to such a book as 
Dr. and Mrs. William Hunter Workman's 
' Through Town and Jungle.' At the cost of 
great self-sacrifice the writers forsook their fav- 
orite pastime of mountain climbing amidst 
eternal snows and descended to the Indian plain, 
probably the hottest portion of the thickly popu- 
lated earth. On heavily laden bicycles, which 
occasionally had to oe pushed by hand over long 
stretches of sand, they visited not only all the 
ordinary show places of the peninsula but num- 
erous out-of-the-way spots heretofore unknown 
to readers of travel books, their quest being gen- 



erally for specimens of Indian architecture, 
Buddhist, Brahman, Jain, and Moslem. After 
accumulating several hundred photographs of 
temple and village scenes, a flood left them as 
poor as before, and most of the journey was 
made over again in order to replace, at least in 
part, their lost negatives. Java and Ceylon, 
though not portrayed in this large volume, the 
authors had explored thoroughly in the architec- 
tural sense some time before, and the learning 
thus acquired is c-onstantly placed at the read- 
er's disposal. Yet, in spite of all the descrip- 
tions and discussions of the text and the hun- 
dreds of reproduced photographs, the reader's 
resulting impression regarding the Indian art of 
building is confusion itself, the value of the vast 
mass of unrelated facts being lost through lack 
of s^-stematic setting forth. The series of tours 
are put down in chronological and geographical 
order, quite regardless of the particular class of 
architecture, and it is made evident that there 
is vastly more remaining than has been seen. 
Xor can it be said that the recital of experiences 
among the natives adds to our knowledge of that 
vast congeries of human souls, exceeding the 
population of the United States fivefold. The 
inhabitants of higher caste of course declined all 
intercourse with the waj^f arers, and the rest were 
too oppressed by the weight of taxation and over- 
population to be of service in most cases. Such 
religious observances as were seen have been 
fully described by others. There were no adven- 
tures except the most prosaic. European con- 
vention excludes reproduction of many of the 
most interesting photographs. In fine, the book 
is quite the dullest that has come from Dr. and 
Mrs. Workman's hands. On the other hand, it 
would be most unfair to deny the value of the 
material, both textual and pictorial, here gath- 
ered together, however unsystematized, or the 
fact that no other recent work on India gives 
any such general impression of the Indian peo- 
ples and architectures. And certainly the list 
of minor difficulties surmounted is sufficiently 
appalling, taken in the mass, to make it unlikely 
that any one less devoted than this congenial 
couple will feel inclined to emulate their tour. 
Nor should the suggestions to Western architects 
regarding the almost virgin field of the Indian 
art be dismissed lightly by those to whom it is 
chiefly addressed. 

^Mecca and the details of the orthodox pil- 
grimage enjoined upon devout Mohammedans 
have been made known to the Kaffir world 
through the courage and self-devotion of many 
Europeans, notably Englishmen; but never be- 
fore has there been an account written from the 
point of view of a follower of the Prophet, how- 
ever sceptical the Persian author of ^ith the 
Pilgrims to Mecca ' may be. The interest of his 



884 



THE DIAli 



[June ly 



account is further heightened by the magnitude 
of the pilgrimage three years ago, when a quar- 
ter of a million souls from all quarters of the 
Eastern world visited the holy city in one vast 
mass. The author, whose name is composed 
entirely of terms of dignity, is a putative devotee 
in a sect unbeloved of the orthodox, and has 
been brought by an English education to 
thoughts still further remote from orthodoxy; 
but he did not fail to renew the devotional feel- 
ings of his youth when brought into contact with 
such myriads of his co-religionaries, and his 
state of mind when passing through the intricate 
and prolonged ritual was as fervent and unques- 
tioning as could be desired. He describes the 
most sacred object in Mecca thus : 

'At first the Stone was whiter than milk, but it 
grew to be black, either by the touch of a certain 
class of woman, by the sins of mankind, or by the 
kisses of the pilgrims. All believers, whatever may 
be the cause to which they attribute the change 
of color, agree that the defilement is purely super- 
ficial, the inside of the Stone being still as white 
as the driven snow. Let us hope that the same 
thing can be said of the hearts of the Faithful, 
whose lips are supposed to have wrought on this 
lodestone of theirs a transformation so miraculous. 
The silver box wherein it lies is about twenty inches 
square, and is raised a little more than five 
feet from the ground. A round window having 
a diameter of some nine inches is kept open on 
purpose to enable the pilgrims to kiss or to touch 
the treasure within, which is known as ' ' the right 
hand of God on earth". This year the act of oscu- 
lation was not performed by more than ten pilgrims 
out of every hundred that attempted it, the crowd 
being utterly undisciplined in its zeal. It must be 
confessed that I owed my good fortune to main 
strength, for I shoved my way through the excited 
mob and examined the Stone curiously while kiss- 
ing it. In color it is a shining black; in shape, 
hollow like a saucer, presumably the result of the 
pressure of devoted lips. A pilgrim, if he fail in 
touching the Stone, must make a reverential salam 
before it, and then pass on. Certain prayers are 
also said.' 

The entire ceremonial is exceedingly impressive, 
and to many who look upon Islam in the conven- 
tional Western manner the elevation of its 
thought and ethics will come as a surprise. It 
is the ability to sympathize with these religious 
essentials that gives the book its chief value, 
since it is a real interpretation of perhaps the 
greatest of all the world's existing rituals in the 
number of its devotees and in the effect it has 
upon them and their fellows. No portion of the 
book lacks interest for the curiously inclined, 
and it is admirably and graphically written. 

Miss Edith Durham's book, ' The Burden of 
the Balkans,' would, single-handed, redeem her 
sex from the accusation of a lacking sense of 
humor. The author's wanderings took her 
through Montenegro and the Albanian provinces 
of Turkey in Europe, part of the time in fur- 
thering the relief work the British had set on 
foot, the remainder in a veritable dash through 



the realms of the Sultan. She was brought into 
intimate contact with the little known races that 
inhabit (and infest) those regions, and she views 
them here, not merely with sympathy, but with 
an ability to laugh at every annoyance they 
caused her. Tlie earlier chapters are given up 
to a consideration of racial problems, in which 
a fine contempt is shown for the artificialities of 
those European statesmen who seek to partition 
the land with little or no relation to the Slavs, 
Bulgars, Serbs, Greeks, Vlahs (Wallachians), 
Albanians, and others, who constitute essentially 
different peoples, with varying traditions, his- 
tories, tongues, beliefs, and political aspirations 
and ideals. 

'At present we have a free Servia, a free Bul- 
garia, a free Greece, a but half ruled and wholly 
disaffected Albania with no Eastern frontier, and 
a no man's land of mixed population, which each 
race hopes ultimately to possess, and over which the 
Porte has yearly less and less control. The Turk's 
death is now considered so imminent that the chief 
concern of each race is how to keep him alive until 
each has made its own claim clear to Europe.' 

The conditions are mediaeval throughout these 
lands, but Miss Durham takes pains to remind 
those who complain of the lack of twentieth cen- 
tury refinement in the Balkans that ' " Human- 
ity" was not invented even in England till the 
beginning of the nineteenth century,' following 
this with another pregnant statement of fact : 

'When a Moslem kills a Moslem it does not count; 
when a Christian kills a Moslem it is a righteous 
act; when a Christian kills a Christian it is an 
error of judgment better not talked about; it is 
only when a Moslem kills a Christian that we arrive 
at a full blown "atrocity" '. 

While working in the Ochrida hospital Miss 
Durham became thoroughly familiar with 
human nature as it exists in those parts, and she 
leaves this amusing record of her native assist- 
ants: 

'If I dropped in at an unexpected hour, I almost 
always had to "tell them that they must not". 
Then they said, first, that they had not been doing 
it; secondly, that it was what they always did; 
thirdly, that the doctor had told them to; fourthly, 
that they did not do what had been ordered; and, 
lastly, that they had been just about to carry out 
the orders when I had arrived. Then we all 
laughed, for they did not in the least mind being 
found out, and the original order was fulfilled in 
the end.' 

It would be pleasant to quote further incidents 
of similar vein from this most instructive and 
amusing book, did space avail. At least a part- 
ing tribute must be paid to Miss Durham's nerv- 
ous and idiomatic English, characteristically 
that of an educated and refined woman, un- 
spoiled by grammars. 

As correspondent for the London ' Daily 
Mail,' Mr. Edmund Candler was attached to 
Colonel Younghusband's column in its invasion 
of Tibet, and he has preserved an account of the

journey in Ms volume called * The Unveiling of 
Lhasa/ Xo small part of the book deals with 
politics, the events leading up to the expedition 
and the events likely to follow it, and here Mr, 
Candler seems to be flatly apologetic and not 
always consistent. He characterizes Great 
Britain's attitude previous to this expedition as 
* weak and abortive,' meaning thereby that Tibet 
was allowed to mind its own business and com- 
pelled the British to mind theirs. All the dis- 
putes arose through Tibetan unwillingness to 
establish commercial relations, and it once more 
appears that the rights of a race in regard to 
dealing with foreigners are based upon no prin- 
ciple of justice that a stronger nation is obliged 
to respect. Something is said of Eussian in- 
fluence, but the book fails to reveal anything of 
the sort, — though why the Tibetans should not 
have the same right to deal voluntarily with 
Russia as with Great Britain under compulsion 
is not apparent to the non-British mind. For 
the rest, the story is surprisingly tame. Mr. 
Candler bears forced tribute to the bravery of 
the natives with whom the superior arms of the 
British engaged ; but he nowhere succeeds in in- 
vesting his accounts of the fighting with any 
vividness or sense of reality. Lhasa itself was 
profoundly uninteresting in the main, though 
the religious rites were not without elements of 
awe, as is made evident in the following extract 
from an account of the services in the great Jok- 
hang, or cathedral : 

'Service is being held before the great Buddhas 
as we enter, and a thunderous harmony like an 
organ peal breaks the interval for meditation. The 
Abbot, ■who is in the center, leans forward from his 
chair and takes a bundle of peacock-feathers from 
a vase by his side. As he points it to the earth 
there is a clashing of cymbals, a beating of drums, 
and a blowing of trumpets and conch shells. Then 
the music dies away like the reverberation of 
cannon in the hills. The Abbot begins the chant, 
and the monks, facing each other like singing-men 
in a choir, repeat the litany. They have extraor- 
dinary deep, devotional voices, at once unnatural 
and impressive. The deepest bass of the West does 
not approach it, and their sense of time is perfect.' 

One does not gather from Mr. Candler's pages 
that the Tibetans are in any sense barbarians, 
and their religion has certainly preserved them 
from development of the warlike spirit and con- 
sequent acts of foreign aggression. 

So charming are the late George Gissing's 
anecdotes and reminiscences of travel on the 
eastern coast of southern Italy, collected under 
the alluring title of ' By the Ionian Sea,' that if 
is respectfully suggested that more novelists be 
persuaded to travel in little known comers of 
Europe and bring back a sheaf of realities. ^Ir. 
Gissing is in love with antiquity, and Latin and 
Greek are still real to him. It is in the full 
classical and historical spirit that he wanders 
from the beaten path of modem davs and takes 



up the tale where it was interrupted by the bar- 
barian centuries ago. He did not always find 
local appreciation, — as when he sought the an- 
cient home of Cassiodorius at Coscia di Stalletti. 
'I had just begun to explain my interest in the 
locality, and I mentioned the name of Cassiodorius. 
As it passed my lips the jovial fellow [a local 
guide] burst into a roar of laughter. "Cassiodorio! 
Ha, ha! Cassiodorio! Ha, ha, ha! " I asked him what 
he meant, and found that he was merely delighted 
to hear a stranger utter a name in familiar local 
use. He ran out from the cave, and pointed up the 
valley; yonder was a fountain which bore the name, 
"Fontana di Cassiodorio". Thereupon, I tried to 
discover whether any traditions cUng to the name, 
but these informants had only a vague idea that 
Cassiodorius was a man of times long gone by.' 

Illness, bad food, occasional extori:ion, and vast 
ignorance were not permitted to outweigh the 
delight Mr. Gissing found in localities conse- 
crated by age and association with happier times, 
and he has conveyed his enjo}Tnent to his readers 
with undiminished force. The volume contains 
some wood engravings by way of pictures, — a 
welcome departure from the almost universal 
half-tone. 

Many books have been written of our far 
northern possessions, and from them it might be 
possible to obtain most of the information 
brought together by Mr. J. S. McLain in his 
volume entitled 'Alaska and the Klondike.' But 
Mr. McLain resorted to no such device of com- 
pilation, obtaining his knowledge at first hand 
in company with a sub-committee of United 
States Senators, who searched the country to 
learn its needs and report thereon to their col- 
leagues. Every advantage was offered, there- 
fore, to see both the dark and bright side of life 
on the edge of and within the arctic zone, and 
the result is a most informing volume. Some 
novel impressions will be gained by tiie reader, 
as when the author says : 

'I do not care to be regarded as a believer in 
large agricultural possibilities fer Alaska, but I 
am impressed with the probability that in the 
interior of that remote country, where food supplies 
from the States must always be expensive, it will 
be practicable and profitable to produce meat and 
dairy and poultry and garden products in such 
quantity and at such prices as to solve the problem 
of development of large areas of gold-bearing 
gravel. ' 

Nearly every part of Alaska was visited, and the 
book should serve for a long time — ■ as books go 
in these rapid days — in the capacity of an 
authoritative reference work. 

Dr. George Aaron Barton's *A Years Wander- 
ing in Bible Lands ' is an unpretentious work 
made up of letters written home during the 
author's journey through England, Germany, 
Austria, Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt. What

Birds ani> Other Folk.* 



It is interesting to notice that there is little 
blurring of the line between the bird books and 
the other nature books of this season. The all- 
round nature-lover who writes of the general 
fascination of out-of-doors, and embroiders his 
theme with a little bird-lore, has for the time 
betaken himself to silence. So far as this fact 
proves the absence of new volumes from Mr. 
John Bun-oughs and Mr. Bradford Torrey and 
others of their class — if there are others of the 
same class — it is wholly lamentable. So far 
as it proves a growing modesty on the part of 
amateurs it may not be very deplorable. Per- 
haps the time is already at hand when a mere 
love of the wild and the things of the wild does 
not so greatly distinguish the lover from his 
fellows as to justify him in publishing his 
thoughts. It may be that like the famous White 
Company, we have all stepped forward. Or it 
may be that instead of becoming more universal, 
the love of nature is taking deeper hold of those 
who profess it, and inspiring in them thoughts 
that do lie too deep for books. In either event 
we are not the losers by the fact that the new 
writings come to us from specialists, and are 
either bird-books or not hird-books, with no 
' mixed up ' class between. 

Of the two characteristically English books on 
our present list, one is distinctly devoted to 
birds, the other as distinctly to the general study 
of nature. Mr. Miall's ' House, Garden, and 
Field ' is not a book one would take on a sum- 
mer vacation for entertainment — it is both too 
good and too dull for that. For its purpose, 
which is to teach teachers to observe nature and

to teach their pupils to observe nature, it is 
admirably fitted. It is packed with scientific 
facts, with clear and practical suggestions for 
class room and study club, and with eye-opening 
and thought-stimulating questions. The draw- 
ings are accurate and easily comprehensible. 
There is no avoiding the query whether the cause 
of science is advanced by an arrangement which 
places in succession chapters on the rock-barn- 
acle, rats and mice, natural history clubs, the 
purple saxifrage, water lilies, and house flies. 
But no arrangement or lack of arrangement can 
destroy the value of the good sense and clarity 
with which these and all the other subjects are 
treated. The chapters on grasses, wood sorrel, 
and the house cricket are especially interesting. 

Another English book, ' Bird Life and Bird 
Lore,' by the scholarly historian Mr. R. Bos- 
worth Smith, is full of delight for all bird-lov- 
ers, Mr. Smith loves the lore almost as well as 
he loves the birds themselves, and it is scarcely 
too much to say that he knows everything that 
has been said in literature about his favorites, 
since the creation. However, he does not thrust 
the greatness of his knowledge upon j^ou, but 
uses it only to enforce his opinions of his winged 
friends. It seems curious at first that his favor- 
ites should be the owl and the raven; but his 
preferences are justified by his experience. For 
the owl he pleads that it is not destructive, 
except of pests, and that other birds mob it 
because as a bird of night, quite unlike them- 
selves, it is a stranger to them. The owl's dig- 
nity he holds in great admiration, saying of his 
visit to the eagle owls in the keep of Arundel 
Castle that ' as you entered you felt somewhat 
as the rude Gaul or as the envoy of Pyrrhus felt, 
when he entered the Roman Senate, that it was 
an assemblage, if not of gods, at least of kings,' 
The raven, his next best friend, he insists was 
belied by the representative Noah sent forth 
from the ark, for he is faithful, intelligent, and 
companionable, although mischievous and 
greedy. The author celebrates many other Eng- 
lish birds with almost equal affection. The book 
is one to be on permanently good terms with, 
for its genuine love of all feathered folk, its 
hatred of cruelty — and Mr. Smith's influence 
has been potent in abolishing the pole-trap and 
other villainies, — its delicate humor, and its 
poetical perspective. 

Mr, Thompson- Seton's little volume, ' Wood- 
myth and Fable,' was not intended very seri- 
ously, and is all the more delicious in conse- 
quence. It is a series of chips from the work- 
shop of a man who does larger things, — the 
brilliant joking of a thinker off duty. Yet not 
wholly off duty either, for the jokes are too 
keenly pointed — appreciably the picture of the 
father porcupine spanking his baby and remark-

ing ^t hurts me far more than it does you.' 
The land-crab who died climbing telegraph 
poles because he would not move an inch out of 
his accustomed path, the little antelope who for 
his discontent was transformed into a giraffe, 
the grasshopper that made a river valley, — all 
these have things to say not unbecoming a wise 
man to hear. And while the wise man listens 
he will be delighted in eye and refreshed in soul 
by the illustrations, which are the very bub- 
bling-over of the author's genius. 

Admirable fooling as this book of Mr. Thomp- 
son- Seton's is, it whets rather than blunts the 
reader's appetite for two books of very different 
type, which will for time to come mark the 
present season as one of notable accomplishment. 
The first of tliese is the work of Mr. and Mrs. 
George W. Peckham on 'Wasps, Social and Soli- 
tar}'.' Mr. John Burroughs in his introduction 
to the volume calls this Hhe most charming 
monograph in any department of our natural 
history that I have read in many a year,' and 
adds: 

'It is a wonderful record of patient, exact, and 
loving observation, which has all the interest of a 
romance. It opens up a world of Lilliput right at 
our feet, wherein the little people amuse and delight 
us with their curious human foibles and whimsi- 
calities, and surprise us with their intelligence 
and individuality. Here I had been saying in print 
that I looked upon insects as perfect automata, 
and all of the same class as nearly alike as the 
leaves of the trees or the sands upon the beach. 
I had not reckoned with the Peckhams and their 
Solitary wasps. The solitary ways of these in- 
sects seem to bring out their individual traits, and 
they differ one from another, more than any other 
wild creatures known to me.' 

The book is written so untechnically that a 
reader who does not know a wasp from a bee 
can understand and enjoy it. The first chapter 
records a series of experiments which prove that 
wasps detect differences in color, and are 
affected by smells more than sounds; the last, 
which is devoted to the difference between 
instinct and intelligence, shows that the wasp's 
sense of direction is due to a careful study of the 
geography of her nest, and not to a mysterious 
sense of location. The intervening pages describe 
some score of wasps, — their nest-building and 
house-keeping, their killing and conveying of 
their prey, their care of their eggs. The authors 
are so careful and minute in their observation 
that they can sometimes correct ahd amend the 
great authority Fabre himself. They say, for 
instance, of Philanthus punctatus: 

'This is a pretty Little yellow-banded species much 
resembling Cerceris in appearance. The nest con- 
sists of a main gallery with pockets leading from it, 
each pocket being stored with one egg and enough 
bees to nourish a singlet larva. When the wasps 
emerge from the cocoon they find themselves in 
the company of their nearest relatives and in pos- 



session of a dwelling place, and they all live to- 
gether for a time before starting out independently 
to seek their fortunes. On the fifth of August we 
discovered on the island a happy family of this 
kind, consisting of three brothers and four sisters, 
the females, with their bright yellow faces and 
mandibles, being handsomer than the males. They 
seemed to be on the most amicable terms with each 
other, their only trouble being that while they 
were all fond of looking out, the doorway was too 
small to hold more than one at a time. The nest 
was opened in the morning at about nine o'clock, 
and during the next thirty or forty minutes their 
comical little faces would appear, one after another, 
each wasp enjoying the view for a few minutes with 
many twitchings of the head, and then retreating 
to make way for another, perhaps in response to 
some hint from behind.' 

Ko less care and devotion, and much more 
travel, has gone to the making of Mr. Job's 
' Wild Wings,' a bird book that will be a lasting 
joy to everyone who has a heart for life in the 
open. From the Magdalen Islands to the Flor- 
ida Keys, Mr. Job has hunted -svith his camera 
' the wild, hardy birds of the sea, whose strong 
wings make them masters of the elements.' He 
has had the grace, moreover, to tell the story of 
his conflicts and victories in a simple, straight- 
forward way. However firm the ordinary bird 
seeker may be in his affection for thrush, bobo- 
link, and other land birds, he cannot but own the 
greater daring and romance of Mr. Job's quest 
for pelican and ibis, spoonbill and kittiwake, or 
withhold his admiration for the wild and often 
grotesque beauty of the pictures Mr. Job brings 
home. For the securing of these pictures the 
ardent 'hunter' is impervious to all creature 
discomforts, standing regardless for hours in 
swamp water, or lying prone on a sand beach in 
the broiling sun, or cramping himself into a 
basket which his friends let down over a rock. 
Often he fastens his camera in a tree above 
a nest, and shutter-string in hand, hides in a 
thicket beneath until the wary bird comes home. 
He has work for his wits also, as in this con- 
quest of a small oyster catcher : 

'The young rascal never moved a feather while 
it was being photographed. But when I thought 
to take it standing, we had a long, hard tussle. 
Finally I conquered by sheer persistence, putting 
my cap over it and removing it suddenly, to snap. 
When I let it go, it was comical to see those long 
stout legs measure off the rods over that sand to- 
ward its fond parents, apparently shouting, — in 
gesture if not in voice, — "Mamma, Mamma, here's 
your little oyster catcher coming like a good one." * 

Mr. Job's grammar is not always as shaky as 
in this case, but his struggles are always equally 
successful. Xo such collection of 'portraits' can 
be found anywhere else, of kittiwakes and gan- 
nets wheeling and tumbling, of unfledged peli- 
cans and herons gawking in their nests, of 
jaegers and petrels skimming the waves, of a 
laughing gull really laughing, of plovers and

ITie merits of *The Garden of Allah' are 
such as to place it distinctly at the head of its 
author's works. Mr. Hichens has hitherto been 
rather unfortunate both in his themes and in 
their treatment, showing a tendency to portray 
morbid types of character and to indulge in 
much unpleasant detail in the working-out of 
his situations. This tendency he has nearly over- 
come in the present instance, and he has, also, 
found a theme that permits of poetic treatment, 
besides lending itself to a strikingly dramatic 
purpose. A man and a woman are thrown 
together in an oasis on the edge of the Sahara, 
and the imagined peace which both have sought 
in repairing to this outpost of civilization 
becomes real in the joy of their mutual love. The 
joy is not lasting however, for when the man's 
secret is revealed, it appears that he is a Trappist 
monk, who has broken his vows, and escaped into 
the world in quest of that knowledge of life 
which the monastery walls had hidden from him 
for a score of years. But the consciousness of 
sin still gnaws at liis soul, and finally forces 
him to the agony of confession. In this spiritual 
crisis, the wife proves herself the stronger of the 
two, for it is she who shows to him the path of 
duty — which is the patii of renunciation and 
expiation — leading him back, at first reluc- 
tantly, then willingly, and in the end almost 
gladly, to his living tomb. And by vi rtue of this

supreme self-sacrifice, both man and woman 
achieve a serener peace than that which they 
had before vainly sought in the desert. The 
story is one of poignant appeal to the spiritual 
sense, and the grave heauty of the tragedy finds 
fitting language for its expression. There is a 
far greater variety of interest than would be 
imagined from the foregoing outline, and the 
author has achieved a brilliant success in his 
picturesque effects. Neither the desert nor its 
denizens seem to have any secrets from him, 
and he records for us the soul of both with pen- 
etrating observation and subtle phrase. In all 
the three essentials of invention, style, and 
thought, this performance is highly commend- 
able, and entitles Mr. Hichens to more serious 
consideration than ever before. 

' Hurricane Island ' is a romance of adventure 
of the good old-fashioned sort, dear to the hearts 
of boys of all ages, and written, withal, in a 
style that commends it to the judicious reader. 
There is a notable villain, a charming heroine, 
and an acceptable hero, all thrown together upon 
shipboard for a while, and then cast upon a 
desert island. The villain leads a mutiny to 
gain possession of the treasure on board, and 
there follows a desperate and protracted con- 
flict. Meanwhile, the ship, having touched at 
Eio and Buenos Ayres, proceeds through the 
Straits of Magellan into the Pacific, and runs 
into Hurricane Island (invented for this pur- 
pose) . There the chief villain dies, riddled with 
bullets, and those of the lesser villains who do 
not share his fate are marooned upon the island, 
while the ship sails off with triumphant virtue 
at the helm. By this time the heroine, a princess 
by birth, is sufficiently subdued, and the hero 
(the ship's doctor) has won the ship, the treas- 
ure, and the maiden all at once. This is a very 
stirring stor}% and is almost as good as Robert 
Louis Stevenson could have made it. 

The novels of Mr. and Mrs. Castle have a 
charm that almost puts them in a class by them- 
selves, a charm which is as manifest as ever in 
their latest joint production, ' Rose of the 
World.' The charm is essentially one of style, 
for the plot is not remarkable, and the situations 
verge upon the melodramatic. But the style 
invests the whole affair with a sort of magical 
glow, and the romantic sentiment of the story 
is admirably sustained. Beginning in India, 
it ends in England, after a series of successful 
assaults upon our emotions, and one situation so 
startling as to be difficult for even romance to 
justify. That the first husband of the heroine, 
mourned for dead, should have been able to 
become a member of her household in the dis- 
guise of an Afghan, and remain unsuspected 
until he declared himself, involves a severe strain 
upon the credulities. But such things do happen

(in romance), and when they happen to such 
striking dramatic purpose as in the present 
instance, we should not grumble very fiercely 
over their improbability. There is humor in the 
book, too, and of a subtle kind, supplied chiefly 
bv the travelling Frenchman who psychologizes 
about the people he meets, and frames the most 
charmingly plausible theories to account for 
their actions. He is nearly, if not quite, the 
most delightful figure in the story. 

We can find no fault with the fashion of 
collaboration as long as it continues to give us 
such charming work as * Kose of the World,' or 
the motor-car novels of C. ?^. and A. M. Wil- 
liamson. ' The Lightning Conductor ' of these 
vivacious writers proved so entertaining that all 
who read it will be eager to get possession of 
' The Princess Passes,' its worthy successor. 
Here are picturesque travel, humorous incident, 
and tender passion all in one, skilfully com- 
mingled in just the right proportions. It is 
not altogether a tale of motoring, for mechanical 
means of locomotion give place in the Alps, and 
at a certain exciting juncture, to the primitive 
and picturesque donkey. This story is so delight- 
ful that we are not disposed to carp overmuch 
at the impossibility of its central situation — 
that of a man travelling for some weeks with a 
girl in boy's disguise, and not discovering the 
imposition. 

Mrs. Humphry Ward's new novel, * The Mar- 
riage of William Ashe,' is having its full share 
of critical attention, as was made inevitable by 
the great and solid reputation of its accomp- 
lished author. Mrs. Ward is one of the few 
novelists who take their art with entire serious- 
ness, and is hence deserving of the most respect- 
ful attention. There is nothing particularly 
striking about the new book. It moves in the 
circles of English society with which the author 
has already made us acquainted by many other 
novels ; it has an Italian setting for some of the 
most striking chapters; it again borrows some 
of its material from the lives of actual historical 
persons as recorded in the memoirs of a past 
age; and it presents an intricate problem of 
conduct for our investigation. All these things 
it does admirably, with the fimmess of handling 
which Mrs. Ward has taught us to expect from 
her, and its ethical plane is high throughout. 
The author dearly loves a lord, and her hero in 
this instance is a very paragon of his class. 
Infatuated by a young woman of doubtful ante- 
cedents, a young woman who may fairly be 
described as a minx, he makes her his wife, and 
accepts all the consequences of the act. The^e 
turn out to be rather serious, for her escapades 
involve both his political career and his per- 
sonal honor ; but he bravely meets them all, and 
is so preposterously magnanimous about it that 



he seems far too good for this wicked world. 
The interest of the work is sustained, rising to 
an effective dramatic climax, and subsiding into 
the pathos of a closing scene of deathbed repent- 
ance and forgiveness. 

'The Vicissitudes of Evangeline,' by Mrs. 
Elinor Glyn, is the sprightly story, told in the 
first person, of a young woman with red hair 
and green eyes, who lives and moves and has her 
being in the smart set of English society. She 
is an irresponsible little creature, not to be com- 
mended for either grammar or behavior, and her 
subsequent career, were it unfolded to us, would 
probably not be unlike that of Mrs. Ward's 
heroine. Mrs. Glyn gives us a minx in the mak- 
ing, while Mrs. Ward describes the finished 
product. This is the author's third book in 
similar vein, and it has the whipped-cream con- 
sistency of its predecessors. It is mildly 
amusing. 

Dartmoor, for many years the undisputed 
literary province of the late Mr. Blackmore, has 
now fallen under the rule of Mr. Eden Phill- 
potts, who holds sway therein by the same divine 
right of genius. To his lengthening list of 
novels with a Dartmoor setting Mr. Phillpotts 
has recently added 'The Secret Woman,' the 
strongest and the most sombre of all these fic- 
tions. The gloom of impending tragedy shad- 
ows the book from the very outset, and the 
breaking of the storm is direful in its fury. At 
the very close there comes a gleam of light to 
soften the tragic effect of what has gone before, 
but the impression ha& been too deep to be thus 
effaced, and the memory long lingers of the sin 
which has wrought all this ruin, and of its 
dreadful consequences. We are tempted to find 
for this book a motto in Mr. Meredith's familiar 
lines: 

' In tragic Ufe, God wot. 
No Yillain need be ! Passions spin the plot : 
We are betrayed by what is false within.* 

So in ' The Secret Woman ' there is no cheap 
effect of downright viUainy, but there is instead 
a subtle study of impulsive sin and its corroding 
effects — a study that rivals * The Scarlet Let- 
ter' in earnestness and psychological pene- 
tration. What relief the story offers may be 
found in the sayings and doings of the rustic 
types which fill the canvas, grouped around the 
central figures. In the delineation of these 
types the author fairly rivals Mr. Hardy, making 
the indigenous population of Dartmoor as real 
to us as that of Wessex. 

' The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne,' as por- 
trayed by Mr. William J. Locke in the novel 
which he has thus named, constitute a curious 
departure from what is conventionally approved, 
yet, considered essentially, they may fairly 
escape censure. He is a scholar, almost a 
recluse, by habit, yet he maintains sentimental

relations with two women which so flout the 
accepted observances of society that his conduct 
is under grave and not unnatural suspicion. 
Eeally, these relations are strictly decorous, but 
they illustrate almost tragically the danger of 
playing with fire. One of the women he has 
befriended after her desertion by a blackguard 
husband, and has been held to her through many 
years by a strong bond of intellectual sympathy. 
Thinking himself passionless, he does not realize 
that she has loved him passionately all the time. 
This particular entanglement is broken by the 
appearance of the errant husband, in the guise 
of the repentant sinner — the unctuous guise of 
Dr. Ibsen's Einar, — and the wife renounces love 
for duty, devoting the remainder of her life to 
the ordering of his irresponsible footsteps. 
Meanwhile, the other woman has appeared upon 
the scene. She is a fascinating creature — a 
child in disposition and hardly more than a 
child in years, — half Oriental in her parentage, 
escaped from a Syrian harem where she was 
reserved for marriage with an objectionable old 
person named Mustapha, and found homeless 
and disconsolate by Marcus Ordeyne in a Lon- 
don park. He takes her to his home, treats her 
like the untutored child that she is, and seeks 
to fashion her into some sort of conformity with 
the ways of the Western world. Gradually he 
finds himself taking more interest in his 
strangely-acquired ward than in his studies, and 
the projected ' History of Eenaissance Morals ' 
gets less and less of his attention as the weeks 
pass. Just as he discovers that he loves the girl, 
and is about to make her his wife, she elopes 
with a dare-devil fellow who has been impru- 
dently admitted to the intimacy of his house- 
hold, and Marcus finds himself the prey of 
emotions which he had never dreamed would 
touch his equable life. After the misery has 
become a little less poignant, he sums up his 
experiences in a passage which we may quote. 

'In the days gone by I was the victim of a 
singular hallucination. I flattered myself on being 
the one individual in the world not summoned to 
play his part in the comedy of Life. I sat alone 
in the great auditorium like the mad king of 
Bavaria, watching with little zest what seemed 
but a sorry spectacle. I thought myself secure in 
my solitary stall. But I had not counted on the 
high gods who crowd shadowy into the silent seats 
and are jealous of a mortal in their midst. With- 
out warning was I wrested from my place, hurled 
onto the stage, and before my dazzled eyes could 
accustom themselves to the footlights, I found my- 
self enmeshed in intolerable drama. I was un- 
prepared. I knew my part imperfectly. I missed 
my cues. I had the blighting self-consciousness of 
the amateur. And yet the idiot mummery was 
intensely real. Amid the laughter of the silent 
shadowy gods I sought to flee from the stage. 
I came to Verona and find I am still acting my 
part. I have always been acting. I have been 
acting since I was born. The reason of our being 



is to amuse the high gods with our histrionics. 
The earth itself is the stage, and the starry ether 
the infinite auditorium.' 

From this despair, none the l^s deep because it 
has reached the philosophical stage, our unpre- 
pared actor slowly worli his way out. Finally, 
the child whose departure had so torn his heart- 
strings comes back to him, • abandoned by her 
lover, and developed into womanhood by the 
bitterness of her experience. The broken 
threads of life are picked up one by one, and the 
end is a real though chastened happiness for 
both man and woman. We have outlined this 
plot at some length, because a briefer abstract 
would have been worse than useless. It remains 
to say that the story is intensely interesting from 
first to last, besides being rich in the sort of liter- 
ary and scholarly allusiveness that appeals most 
strongly to the cultivated mind. Mr. Locke has 
given us excellent work before, but this is by far 
the best thing he has done, and we give it an 
ungrudging welcome. 

In the matters of typography, illustration, 
and decorative detail, Mr. Eobert Ames Bennet's 
' For the White Christ ' is a companion volume 
to Miss Liljencrantz's two tales of Viking days 
and deeds. In theme, also, the work is similar, 
for it is a romance of the days when Karl the 
Great was engaged in the most difficult part of 
his task of empire-building, and its hero is a 
Norseman who becomes pledged to the great 
ruler and who eventually marries his daughter. 
The canvas of the work is very large indeed, 
and includes battle-fields all the way from the 
Pyrenees to the Baltic, and the hosts of the 
Dane, the Frank, the Saxon, and the Moor. All 
this portentous historical material, blended with 
much intrigue and passion, together with some 
of the gentler elements of romance, is skilfully 
brought into a tale of much action and dramatic 
vigor, couched in language that makes a fair 
pretence of archaism (of the conventional type, 
naturally), and brought to a satisfactory issue. 
The story of Roland at Roncesval is but one of 
the many episodes which ornament this ambi- 
tious historical portrayal. Various verse-frag- 
ments from mediaeval saga and epic serve as 
chapter-headings, and add not a little to the 
poetical effectiveness of the book. But we know 
not ' Gummerle,' who is cited as one of the 
author's authorities. 

Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady's latest romantic 
production is called 'The Two Captains,' and 
consists of two parts — i a preface and a histor- 
ical tale. The latter is a narrative of the duel 
between Kapoleon and Nelson, ending with the 
Battle of the Nile, and introducing many pic- 
turesque incidents and figures. The love-inter- 
est is provided by an Irish Captain imder 
Nelson's command and the fair daughter

of a royalist emigre and ci-dsvant admiral in the 
royal navy of France. The figure of this gentle- 
man is drawn with fine sympathy, and makes 
those of the two great historical protagonists 
seem like lay figures in comparison. Mr. Brady 
gets up his historv- very carefully, and is almost 
over-technical in his description of sea-fighting. 
His pref ac-e, although brief, is quite as interest- 
ing as his romance, being aimed at the critic for 
the purpose of guiding aright the footsteps of 
that miserable person. He is enjoined to discuss 
the book itself, and to refrain from discussing 
the personality of the author, or his literary 
fecundity, — in short, to refrain from minding 
the author at all. We have sought, with diffi- 
culty, to follow this admirable counsel, but feel 
bound to observe that the pages which contain it 
have a pxmgency which make them no less in- 
teresting (as well as instructive) than any of 
those that follow. 

Mr. Samuel M. Gardenhire has written, in 
* The Silence of Mrs. Harrold,' a novel of strong" 
and complex interest. It is one of those novels 
that begin in half a dozen places, and keep the 
reader puzzling over the possible relations of 
the persons and incidents introduced, until 
gradually order is evolved out of the seeming 
chaos, and all these disjecta membra are per- 
ceived to be parts of a single organic whole. It 
is a dangerous method to employ, and is more 
likely than not to lack adequate justification 
when the complete pattern of the plot is dis- 
closed, but in the present case we are bound to 
admit that the writer has done his work skil- 
fully enough to escape serious censure. The 
weakness of the book is in the fact that the 
reasons for Mrs. Harrold's silence (and the 
agony following thereupon) prove to have been 
less cogent than we had a right to expect, and 
regarded in this light, the book is rather disap- 
pointiag. But there is no denying its power to 
hold the attention. The story is essentially one 
of modem life (mainly in Xew York), and it 
makes a special feature of exploiting the ways 
of the unscrupulous syndicate that has of late 
years fastened itself upon our dramatic activity. 
Thus, various types of actors and managers 
divide our interest with the other characters, 
millionaires, lawyers, and inventors — ^to say 
nothing of the women — who people these pages. 
It is certainly a novel of the better sort, and 
deserves respectful consideration. 

The dramatic incidents and the humors of a 
presidential campaign provide a theme for ' The 
Candidate,' Mr. Altsheler's new novel. The 
campaign described is an eclectic affair, not to 
be identified with any particular campaign in 
our recent histor}'. but borrowing features from 
more than one, while in the personality of the 
candidate there are certain suggestions, at least. 



that make us think of Mr. Bryan rather than of 
any other recent leader. But the author has 
skilfully avoided anything like precision of 
characterization, seeking to project into the 
future the imagination of his reaxiers, although 
necessarily dravring his essential material from 
experience of the past. In the ordinary mean- 
ing of construction, there is very little to be 
found in this story. It is a chronicle of the 
doings, the haps and mishaps, of a presidential 
candidate from the time of his nomination to the 
night of his triumph. He seems to be the nomi- 
nee of the Democratic party, although even that 
point is left in uncertainty, for all that 
may be positively averred is that he is a West- 
erner, filled with a righteous hatred of Wall 
Street, and for that reason opposed by the influ- 
ential Eastern minority of his party. When he 
takes a decided stand against the iniquities of 
the tariff, that opposition becomes virulent, but 
the very boldness of the step brings him enough 
new support from unexpected quarters to bear 
him on to victory. It is not exactly easy to 
reconcile one's imagination to an election in 
which tariff reform carries the State of Penn- 
sylvania; but that is the situation which meets 
us in the closing chapter. The interest of the 
gtory is largely provided by certain episodes 
dragged into the narrative by force, as it were, 
in which the candidate acts as a. deus ex machina 
in straightening out private difficulties. Some- 
thing of this sort was necessary for the sake of 
variety, but the book is made thereby a very 
disjointed affair. The newspaper reporter who 
has already figured in one of Mr. Altsheler's 
earlier stories is the secondary hero of the pres- 
ent work. He is the close friend of the candi- 
date, and accompanies him throughout the cam- 
paign. He also falls in love with the candidate's 
niece, which provides a pretty element of 
romance. The author often descends to carica- 
ture of a kind too broad to be really effective, 
particularly in the case of one correspondent of 
a l^ew York newspaper. There can be little 
doubt as to what particular journal is meant, 
and none whatever of the malicious animus with 
which it is assailed. Mr. Altsheler has given us 
a thoroughly readable story, written in the 
breezy journalistic manner for which his expe- 
rience has fitted him; it is a story, moreover, 
which reveals an intimate acquaintance with 
our political life, and a well-developed moral 
sense of its underlying issues.

THE DIAX,

Notes on New Novels. 



It is a curious coincidence that in Mr. Frank 
Lewis Nason's 'The Vision of Elijah BerF and Mr. 
John H. Whitson's 'Justin Wingate, Ranchman,' 
both published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., the 
theme should be taken from the visions of two 
religionaries, the former book bearing out the proph- 
ecy of a Californian valley made softly green and 
luxuriant with orange trees grown by irrigation, the 
latter doing the same thing with a valley in Colo- 
rado brought into fruitfulness through the small 
farms that supplant the older cattle ranches when 
irrigation is introduced. Here, however, resem- 
blances cease. Mr. Nason, himself an engineer, 
accords the place of hero to the man who dams the 
rivers, tunnels the mountains, and brings into being 
the dream of the visionary Berl; while Mr. Whitson, 
experienced in newspaper work and life in the West, 
shows how a little foundling lad grows up into whole- 
someness in spite of sordid surroundings, owing to 
the teachings of a good man and the love of a bright 
and worthy girl. Mr. Nason introduces a theme of 
practical honesty and commercial integrity, showing 
how the almost fanatic Calvinist, sure of his own 
election, is too easily persuaded into rank betrayal 
of trust and actual felony, his moral delinquency 
being accentuated by his discarding the love of 
his adoring and colorless wife for the unretumed 
love of a thoroughly capable Californian woman 
of business. Justin Wingate 's temptations come 
to him while he is a member of the Colorado legis- 
lature, but he keeps his soul and body clean even 
while those most closely connected with him suc- 
ceed in turning the monopoly of the cattlemen into 
the monopoly of water following the introduction 
of irrigation. 

An episode in Boston society is portrayed by an 
anonymous hand in 'The Opal' (Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co.), the book taking its title from the soubriquet 
of the girl whoi plays the leading part. She has 
been so reared that she takes on the color of the 
company she chances to be with, and is married to 
a man whose nature^ requires constant bolstering. 
The result is not fortunate, each intensifying the 
lack of the other. Another girl confesses her love 
for the husband when she is on the point of sub- 
mitting to an operation which promises to be fatal. 
She survives, the wife eventually dies, and after 
a considerable time needed to convince the girl 
that she is not being proposed to merely because 
she had been too confiding, there is a second mar- 
riage and the curtain falls. It will be seen that 
the argument is unusual, and it is strikingly pre- 
sented. It seems, however, to be a theme too ex- 
tensive for treatment so brief, and there are other 
evidences, slight but convincing, of lack of crafts- 
manship. There can be little doubt, for all that, 
of the accuracy of the picture it presents of a 
certain phase of Boston social life, and its interest 
is unfailing. 

Mr. Alfred Henry Lewis, as the interpreter of life 
in a cattle town of the Southwest, is able to com- 
bine fact and fancy into a convincing whole, and 
'The Sunset Trail' (Barnes) follows the 'Wolfville' 
stories in logical succession. Just as an earlier vol- 
ume related the more or less apocryphal deeds and 
sayings of Colonel William Greene Sterett, so this 
is written around Mr. William Barclay ('Bat') Mas- 
terson, informing the world of that worthy's cool- 
headed and unquestioning courage and sureness of 
aim while sheriff of a Texas county. The quaint 
and expressive vocabulary of those parts dominates 



all the conversations, and Mr. Lewis's keen wit and 
almost hypertrophied sense of the ridiculous makes 
the volume intensely interesting to those who have 
any well developed humor of their own — enough, 
say, to keep them from being shocked at a code of 
morals sufficiently practical for the time and place 
but coinciding at few points with that of our more 
usual civilization. Dodge City, the very crown of 
the cattle region, is the scene of this tale of the 
simple life as lived in Texas a generation ago. 

The difficulties that lie between the idealism of 
a woman's college and the finding of one's self iu 
the greater practical world, when that self has a 
Latin temperament and is forced to dwell in 
America, are set forth by Miss Anna Robeson 
Brown in 'The Wine Press' (Appleton), a study of 
character of much worth. The heroine is the 
daughter of a New England mother and an Italian 
poet who has abandoned his family for the love of 
a great actress. To the college where Giovanna is 
struggling with a conventional education comes the 
actress and her daughter. Giovanna takes charge 
of the irresponsible little girl, her half sister, fol- 
lows her to New York, and is with her when she 
comes to an end that Gipvanna thinks morally 
culpable. Thence Giovanna goes as governess to 
the daughter of a distinguished painter, a man 
quite devoid of morals, fleeing thence to the house 
in northern New England in which her mother was 
born. A physician is the hero of the tale, a fine 
fellow who holds the reader's sympathies. The 
book is unconventional in its interest, and above 
the average of contemporary fiction. 

Notwithstanding the flood of Revolutionary 
romances during the past few years, there is still 
room for so true a tale of love and adventure as 
Miss Theodora Peck recounts in 'Hester of the 
Grants: A Romance of Old Bennington' (Fox, Duf- 
field & Co.). The reference in the main title is to 
the New Hampshire Grants out of which the state of 
Vermont came into independent being. The border 
warfare of the period, culminating in the vividly 
and convincingly described battle of Bennington, 
the part played by the scouts and spies of the oppos- 
ing armies, the varying fortunes of war by which 
the captor of to-day becomes the prisoner of to- 
morrow, the strife of three or four men of different 
aspirations and widely variant character for the 
love of the beautiful and patriotic Hester, the intro- 
duction of Ethan Allen, Colonel Stark, Ira Allen, 
and other historic characters, — all these elements 
combine to form a panorama of the times which 
deserves careful reading and much commendation. 

In 'Psyche: A Romance of the Reign of Tibe- 
rius' (Little, Brown & Co.), Mr. Walter S. Cramp 
has done an ambitious and gratifying bit of inter- 
pretation, portraying on one side the simple and 
satisfying family life of humbly situated Greeks in 
exile at Rome and on the other the inconceivably 
corrupt practices of the imperial Roman court. It 
is Psyche, the dancing girl, and Gyges, the chariot- 
eer, who are heroine and hero of the little romance 
that runs through the story, but the writer's chief 
concern is with Tiberius himself and with the infa- 
mous ^lius Sejanus, whose rise from prefect of the 
Praetorian Guard to the consulship by the most 
infamous means and whose sudden downfall just as 
he expected to grasp the reins of power are vividly 
set forth, — in spite of the literary conventions 
which stand between the modern reader and a com- 
plete account of heathendom at its worst. The lead- 
ing figures of Roman palace life appear, Agrippina, 
widow of Germanicus, chief among them, to show 
what Rome had been in better davs.

Mr. William Dana Orcutt's 'The Flower of Des- 
tiny' (McClurg) contains the full story of the love 
between Mademoiselle de Montijo and Prince Louis 
Napoleon, from the moment of their meeting at 
Lady Blessington's in London to the striking scene 
at Compiegne when the newly crowned emperor of 
the French introduces the beautiful girl to his 
brilliant court as the future Empress Eugenie. The 
book opens with the coming of Louis to the British 
capital just ofter his escape from the fortress of 
Ham, and he is permitted to tell in his own words 
the. well-planned release from imprisonment. The 
sincerity of the affection which rises in the princely 
adventurer's heart at his first introduction to the 
lovely Spaniard, the hold it takes and keeps upon 
him, Eugenie 's disinterested willingness to with- 
draw that her lover may wed according to his 
station, and the manner in which her last objection 
is removed form a romance that was well worth the 
interesting treatment Mr. Orcutt has given it. A 
word should be said for the physical beauty of the 
book, its inset illustrations and violet decorations 
for every page being as appropriate as they are 
artistic. 

At last the American fireman has had something 
like justice done him in our literature, Mr. Harvey 
J. O'Higgins's 'The Smoke-Eaters' (Century Co.) 
being an interrelated series of tales of the New York 
fire department, — more particularly of one of the 
companies in it, its captain and its members. Mr. 
O'Higgins, in fine contrast to many of his fellow- 
writers, has paid his readers the compliment of 
carefully revising his work so that it presents itself 
as a homogeneous whole without repetitions; he 
has also confined himself to the heroic deeds and 
curious idiosyncrasies of his characters without at- 
tempting to thrust any love of woman into the 
narrative. With one exception all the characters are 
Irishmen, who seem to have a general qualifica- 
tion for the cool-headed courage which makes mod- 
em successful fire-fighting possible. When these 
heroes of peace are not actually engaged in saving 
lives and extinguishing flames, they are rather more 
human than lovable, as Mr. O 'Higgins depicts them, 
though the writer never lets any sympathy for his 
characters be lost. 

Miss F. F. Montresor borrows the title for her 
latest novel, 'The Celestial Sxirgeon' (Longmans, 
Green & Co.), directly from Stevenson's poem, but 
she fails rather palpably to convince her readers 
that the title is fully applicable. A baby girl, 
the unblest offspring of an Englishman of family 
and a Frenchwoman of education, is taken for 
adoption by an English spinster whose estates adjoin 
those of her father's people, the latter property 
being now in possession of a retired tradesman who 
is writing the family history. The spinster marries 
a discredited physician, and the girl goes to the 
kindly natured neighbor in consequence. The end 
does not come with her eventual marriage to him, 
but is delayed until after his death, the birth of a 
posthumous child, and the reconciliation not only 
of the girl and her mother, but of the mother's 
husband. This sounds somewhat confused, but the 
book itself has a diversity of interests which do 
not admit of succinct statement. The theme, as 
suggested in the title, lies in the gradual awaken- 
ing to charitable thought of the heroine, keeping 
pace with her increased knowledge of life. 

Nothing previously written by Mr. Charles Heber 
Clark — 'Max Adeler' — has given promise of a storj- 
80 creditable as that of 'The Quakeress' (John C 
Winston Co.), the charming and ill-fated heroine of 
•which stands out clearly among the multitudinous 



heroines of contemporary fiction. The scene is 
laid in Pennsylvania just before and during the 
Civil War. The girl is beloved by a fine young 
man of her own creed, but a worldly brother and 
sister from the South come into the; lives of the 
almost betrothed pair with serious results. An ele- 
ment of humor is supplied by the wife of an Epis- 
copalian rector, a character almost worthy of being 
mentioned with Anthony TroUope's famous Mrs. 
Pronty. Some admirable descriptions add to the 
interest of the book, and there is a chapter con- 
cerned with the battle of Gettysburg, as it was seen 
by the inhabitants of the region, which gives a 
vivid conception of the horrors of war. 

The transition stage between the Quaker civiliza- 
tion and that of the world's people in Pennsylvania 
before the Civil War. more especially as illustrated 
in the single career of the firmly drawn character 
whose name is that of the book, is the central 
theme of Mr. Edward Uffington Valentine's new 
novel, 'Hecla Sandwith' (Bobbs-Merrill). The 
story is a long one, and not firmly knit together, 
but it has much to do with the development of the 
spiritual side of a girl whose education has taken 
her far from the simplicity of the Friends. An Eng- 
lish mining engineer prevails upon Hecla to marry 
him while her heart is still in the keeping of her 
cousin, the latter being effectually barred from 
her by the prejudice of the Quaker against the mar- 
riage of cousins. The conclusion, wherein the hus- 
band wins at last the real affection and respect of 
his recalcitrant wife, is the best written portion .-if 
a book that preserves with almost photographic 
fidelity the manners and customs of a time fully 
departed. 

The four stories of varying length that Mr. 
Maurice Hewlett brings together under the title of 
'Fond Adventures' (Harper) will be something of 
a disappointment to nearly all of the large circle 
of admirers who have followed this writer's work 
from the beginning. The brief tale of love, min- 
strelsy, and rapine that opens the volume leaves 
anything but an impress of artistic sincerity, while 
its successor, a revival of the 'Captain Brazenhead' 
of a former volume, is spun out until it is nothing 
less than dull. The third story, setting forth the 
ruthlessness with which a lover is murdered by his 
opponents in the Florence of renaissance days, has 
a climax striking for its exhibition of this quality 
of ruthlessness. and in that is fully up to the stan- 
dard Mr. Hewlett has set for himself in work pre- 
viously published. The last of the four stories, 
'The Love Chase,' is the longest, but is more con- 
spicuous for manner than for matter. Taken as a 
whole, the impression remains that the book is made 
up of work done early in Mr. Hewlett's literary 
career, and denied publication until now. 

Romance of the fourteenth century fills the pages 
of Mr. C. E. D. Phelps's 'The Accolade' (Lippin- 
cott). The hero, son of a worthy Englishman, being 
kidnapped into France by a ship's captain, betakes 
himself to Italy, wins a knighthood through gallant- 
ry, and returns to his native England with wealth 
and honor just in time to prevent his sweetheart 
from entering a convent for lack of him. The poets 
are reverenced in the persons of Chaucer and Pe- 
trarch, and it is from a careful study of the writ- 
ings of the former that the rather difl&cult and mul- 
tifarious dialects of Mr. Phelps's book are con- 
structed, even the ordinary narrative being loaded 
with archaisms. The book shows the most careful 
study and great painstaking, and abounds in varied 
adventure. The rudeness of the England of the 
period and the refinement of Italy serve as foils.

THE DIAL

each for the other, and the whole tale is- in the 
nature of a treasure house for the student of 
customs. 

Cape Cod is in a sense the heart of that New 
England which remains untouched and unassimil- 
ated by modernity. There Mr, Joseph C, Lincoln 
places all the action of his latest story, 'Partners 
of the Tide' (Barnes), and to the book many an 
exiled man and woman of our northeastern states 
can turn for joyful recollection of earlier days. A 
small boy is adopted on the death of his parents 
by two maiden kinswomen, goes to school, and falls 
under the influence of the captain of a vessel in 
the coasting trade. After some years on board his 
ship, the dishonesty of their employers forces them 
back upon their own resources and they become the 
joint owners of a wrecking schooner. The interest 
of the story is pretty well divided between the 
young fellow's love for a neighbor and schoolmate 
and his business success, but it is in the sketches 
of New England character threaded upon the nar- 
rative that its chief attractiveness lies. Dry Yan- 
kee wit, shrewdness, and common sense are scat- 
tered through the pages in a way to delight lovers 
of the sea and of New England. 

'The Belted Seas' (Holt), by Mr. Arthur Colton, 
is both picaresque and nautical, being made up of 
the varied adventures on sea and shore — with a sin- 
gle excursion inland, due to a tidal wave — of one 
Captain Thomas Buckingham, a New Jerseyman, in 
company with a select assortment of 'down-east' 
Yankees, South Americans, savages from the Pacific 
Islands, Central Americans, Chinese, Burmese, an.l 
others, the whole culminating in an elopement after 
the doughty captain had abandoned the sea for 
the comparatively prosaic occupation of hotel-keep- 
ing along Long Island Sound. The captain himself 
tells the story of his thirty years' wanderings with 
a humor characteristically American, interspersing 
his narrative with reflections upon the conduct of 
life in general which sum up no. small part of tho 
wisdom of the ages. Some of his turns of thought 
are provocative of the heartiest laughter, and he 
never permits his auditors an instant of boredom. 

The charming art shown by Mrs, Sara Andrew 
Shafer in her second book, 'Beyond Chance ot 
Change' (Macmillan), has a certain resemblance 
to that of the actor. The life of children not yet 
in their 'teens, inhabitants of a little city of the 
middle West at a time soon after the Civil War, 
is set forth in a manner that will recall his own 
childhood to every grown person into whose hands 
the book may fall. It is a little girl who holds 
the center of the stage, and girls and women are 
accorded practically all the realism of the tales, 
the men and boys being — from a masculine point 
of view, at least — considerably idealized. No smnll 
part of the charm of the narrative lies in its re- 
moval from the strentiosities of modern city life, 
while for the little people there is the most careful 
inculcation of a pure morality which never degen- 
erates into cant. 

Mr. Harold MacGrath contributes two volumes to 
'The Pocket Books' (Bobbs-Merrill). 'The Prin- 
cess Elopes' is a brief tale of that eastern Europe 
which lies near the Bohemian coasts, wherein a 
young American college man of great wealth and 
attractiveness' succeeds in winning the heiress to 
a little throne, it being discovered in the process 
of this adventure that he is the long lost heir to 
a throne adjoining. The story would be much 
more interesting if its outcome were less clearly 
foreshadowed, though it is difficult to see how this 
could be avoided in the space accorded the nar- 



rative. The other volume, 'Enchantment,' con- 
tains five tales, most of them having to do with 
some little turn of destiny rather remote from the 
ordinary course of human existence. The scenes of 
four are in the United States, and deal severally 
with politics, polite adventure, and love; the other 
takes place at Monte Carlo. Without being in any 
way remarkable, both books will provide amuse- 
ment and entertainment, and were not written with 
any other end in view. 

It is the glamour of the artistic temperament 
that leads Mrs. Willa Sibert Cather to name her 
collection of short stories 'The Troll Garden' (Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co.). Seven truly entertaining 
studies of somewhat abnormal human nature fill 
the little book, and leave abundant food for re- 
flection. The first possesses subtlety, being an 
account of a woman who runs after celebrities of 
various sorts, is grossly insulted by one of them, 
and yet persists in blundering on, a subject for mirth 
to her enemies and of pity to her friends, 'The 
Sculptor's Funeral,' which follows, is quite as 
vivid in its abruptness of contrast, the bringing 
home to a sordid little western village of the body 
of a distinguished artist affording the opportunity 
for contrasting noble artistic ideals and the crass- 
est commercialism. Taken as a whole, the book 
indicates more than usual talent for close delinea- 
tion.

THE DIAL 



[Jane 1, 



The material for this work, with its eight hundred 
illustrations, is drawn from the best recent author- 
ities and is presented in untechnical language. 

A timely book for the wide circle of workers in 
the delightful field of nature-photography will be 
published at once by the A. Wessels Co. in Mr. 
P. C. Snell's 'The Camera in the Field.' 

A new volume of essays by Dr. William Osier, 
who recently sailed for England to take up the 
duties of Regius Profes«or of Medicine at Oxford, 
will be published early next fall by Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish a new edition, 
in a single volume, of * A History of Ancient Sculp- 
ture' by IMiss Lucy M. Mitchell. "We see no evi- 
dence of changes in the text, although the work is 
now over twenty years old. 

The annual Summer Classes for the Study of Eng- 
lish conducted by Mrs. H. A. Davidson will be held 
this year at Cambridge, Mass., from July 11 to Aug- 
ust 17. The classes are designed to afford personal 
guidance and instruction in the study of literature, 
literary art, the English language, and composition. 

A new novel by Mr. S. E. Crockett, entitled 
'May Mjargaxet,' will be published at once by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. This firm has also 
in preparation an elaborate volume on 'The Cathe- 
drals of England,' the special feature of which 
will be a series of sixty illustrations in full color. 

Volumes II. and III. of the 'Journals of the Conti- 
mental Congress,' edited by Mr. Worthington C. 
Pord, have appeared from the Government Printing 
Office. The year 1775 is the period covered by this 
instalment of what is perhaps the most important 
work thus far undertaken by the Library of Con- 
gress. 

'Trusts, Pools, and Corporations,' edited by Dr. 
William Z. Eipley, and published by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co., is a volume of discussions of typical cases. 
The eighteen chapters are the work of many hands, 
and in each chapter some combination of recent 
years is analyzed, explained, and commented upon 
at length. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish a new and 
enlarged edition of Mr. AV. C. Brownell's subtle and 
discriminating essays on 'French Art: Classic and 
Contemporary, Painting and Sculpture.' The new 
matter is a chapter on 'Rodin and the Institute,' 
aside from which the text is identical with that of 
the illustrated edition of 1901. 

'Tides of the Spirit,' published by the American 
Unitarian Association, is a volume of selections 
from the writings of James Martineau. The book is 
edited by the Rev. Alfred Lazenby, who contributes 
a sympathetic introduction — an essay on ' the mas- 
ter who first opened mine eyes to the spiritual re- 
alities of life and taught me to see the divine 
.within the human.' 

The American branch of Mr. John Lane's publish- 
ing business has lately been incorporated as The 
John Lane Company, with Mr. Lane as president 
and Mr. Rutger B. Jewett as vice-president and 
business manager. It is the purpose of the corpo- 
ration to occupy more fully the American field, and 
to develop the American section of Mr. Lane's 
magazine, 'The International Studio.' 

Two interesting biographies soon to be issued 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are 'A Pietist of 
the Napoleonic Wars,' an account of the eventful 
life of the Countess Reden, and Mrs. Colquhoun 
Grant's 'A Mother of Czars,' a sketch of the life 
of Marie Feodorowna, wife of Paul I. and mother 



of Alexander I. and Nicholas I. The same firm has 
also in preparation a volume of letters by Count 
Paul Hatyfeldt, late German Ambassador to Eng- 
land, written during the period of the Franco- 
German War from the headquarters of the King of 
Prussia. 

A book called 'The Confessions of Lord Byron,* 
in the form of a collection of the chief personal 
and literary discussions in the poet's Letters and 
Journals, will be published shortly by the Messrs. 
Scribner. The' material has been so selected and 
arranged by Mr. W. A. Lewis Bettany that the 
reader can trace from month to month and from 
year to year the development of BjTon's most inti- 
mate opinions. 

Mr. J. Fitzmaiirice-Kelly in his paper on 'Cer- 
vantes in England ' points out that ' England was the 
firstl foreign country to mention "Don Quixote," 
the first to translate the book, the first country in 
Europe to present it decently garbed in its native 
tongue, the first to indicate the birthplace of the 
author, the first to provide a biography of him, the 
first to publish a commentary on "Don Quixote," 
and the first to issue a critical edition of the text. ' 

The Messrs. Harpers announce that the second 
set of five volumes in the important series of 'The 
American Nation' will not be published all at one 
time, as were the first five. Instead, the volumes 
will appear at the rate of one a month during the 
coming summer. The next in the series, Vol. VI.,. 
will probably be issued in June. It is written by 
Professor Evarts B. Greene, of the Illinois State 
University, and bears the title of 'Provincial 
America. ' 

In his introduction to the recent facsimile repro- 
duction of the First Folio of Chaucer (1532) the 
Rev. Professor Skeat points out that copies of this- 
famous book are even rarer than the First Folio of 
Shakespeare and that in the case of both Chaucer 
and Shakespeare there are four Folio editions. 
Thynne's edition of Chaucer, the only one of 
value, has been reproduced by collotype at the 
Oxford University Press, the British Museum copy 
having been used for the purpose. 

Mr. Francis Hobart Herrick's interesting book 
on bird study and photography entitled 'The Home 
Life of Wild Birds,' first published in 1901, is 
now issued in a revised edition by the Messrs. 
Putnam. " The text has been largely rewritten^ 
there are several new chapters, and forty-eight new 
illustrations have been added in place of a smaller 
number omitted. The author has made long and 
intimate study of a fascinating subject, and his 
book will prove a delight to everj- nature-lover. 

A supplement to the abridged edition of 'Poole's 
Index to Periodical Literature,' edited as usual by 
Mr. William I. Fletcher and Miss Mary Poole, 
with the cooperation of the American Library As- 
sociation, will be published next month by Messrs. 
Houghton, ;Mifflin & Co. This supplement indexes, 
after the approved method of the Poole series, 
thirty-seven leading periodicals for the five years 
1900-1904. The list of periodicals covered is the 
same as in the original abridged edition, except 
that 'Everybody's Magazine' and 'The World's 
Work' are substituted for two older magazines no 
longer published. 

A new edition of Swan Sonnensehein's well- 
known work, 'The Best Books,' with its supple- 
ment, 'The Reader's Guide to Contemporary Lit- 
erature,' is definitely announced for early publica- 
tion. The first book, which classified and described 
the 'best 50,000' books current at that date, was 



1905.]

published in 1887, and reprinted in an enlarged and 
improved form; and 'The Reader's Guide,' issued 
in 1895, brought the literature down to the end of 
1894. The new vrork will contain in a single vol- 
ume all that is worth preserving of the two previ- 
ous books, with additional bibliographies, refer- 
ences, notes and characterizations up to the middle 
of the year 1905.

DOOK publishers and book journals are 
'—^ alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous jovu'nals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. All 
the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preeminently a hook 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 



TTHE dial is more generally consulted 
*■ and depended upon by Librarian's in 
making up orders for books than any 
other American ci'itical journal; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other jom-nal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-bltters, 
covering every section of the country.

By KDWARO DOTLE, Author of "Moody Moments." 
Bound in cloth, gilt top, $1.00 

" Mr. Doyle is a blind singer who, even in hia darkness, finds enri- 
able portions of hope and tenderness. An inspiring song of the last- 
ingness of democracy is among the numbers of his new volume." 

—New York World. 
" I hsTe read the poems with interest and sympathy. It is not given 
to everyone shut from the outer light to have ' inward-seeing eyes ' that 
can make * their own deep midnight and rich mom' — if you will allow 
me to quote some words I wrote on Milton. It must add even to the 
pleasure you take in writing verses to know that others like them, so 
I tell you that I do."— Thomat Bailey Aldrich.

THE MAZZINI CENTENARY. 



"Worsliippers of the ideal who found last 
month chiefly noteworthy because it rounded 
the first hundred years since the death of Schil- 
ler may find the present month mainly memor- 
able as marking the first centennial of Mazzini's 
birth. A believer in the doctrine of metempsy- 
chosis might well be impressed with the fact 
that some six weeks after the German poet 
yielded up his breath the apostle of Italian 
unity became a living soul, and entered upon a 



life which was destined to be consecrated to the 
same lofty aims, and to be crowned with a fairer 
vision ere its close. And those to whom the 
transmigration of souls is but a baseless imagin- 
ing may find in the coincidence an apt illustra- 
tion of the old figure of the torch-bearers, each 
handing to his successor the sacred light of the 
truth that in the end must surely make man 
free. 

Different as were the circumstances environ- 
ing the lives of Schiller and Mazzini, different 
not only in their personal bearings, but also in 
all those broader aspects whereby the eighteenth 
centur}' was separated from the nineteenth, we 
must recognize nevertheless that the two men 
were inspired by one and the same patriotic 
impulse, one and the same gospel of human 
brotherhood, one and the same austere ethics of 
devotion and self-sacrifice. Each in his own 
way all his life long fought the good fight; 
each was a true knight of the spirit in thought 
and deed; and the memory of each remains to 
us as a shining example of fortitude in adver- 
sity, of hopefidness in discoura^ment, and of 
faith in an ideal whose light was dimmed for 
duller visions by the sullen mists of c}"nicism, 
and indifferentism, and selfishness. All honor 
to these souls, and to all kindred souls whose 
keen sight, purged as with euphrasy and rue, 
is fixed steadfastly upon goals too far-set to 
be discerned by the commonalt}', yet surely es- 
tablished as the ultimate aims of human aspira- 
tion. 

Mazzini was not without his meed of sympa- 
thy and fitting appreciation during his lifetime, 
and to few men have such tributes been paid as 
were bestowed upon him in his later years, and 
have continued to be bestowed, by the noblest 
spirits of the age, since his death. 'All honor 
to thee, thou noble Mazzini,' said Clough, writ- 
ing from Eome in the last days of the Trium- 
virate, ' when from Janiculan heights thundered 
the cannon of France.' Carlyle, usually grudg- 
ing of praise, called him ' a man of genius and 
virtue, a man of sterling veracity, humanity, 
and nobleness of mind.' The Master of Balliol 
said of him that 'he had a genius beyond that 
of most ordinary statesmen,' and Mr. John 
Morley pronounced him 'probably the highest 
moral genius of the century.' Imagiaative 
writers, too, have glorified him in verse and 
prose: he is exalted in Mr. Meredith's 'Vit- 
toria,' and Mr. Swinburne has constituted 
himself paneg}Tist-in-chief of him whose ad-

vent is thus prophesied in ' Marino Faliero' : 

* Men that hear 
His name far off shall yearn at heart, and thank 
God that they hear, and live: but they that see, 
They that touch hands with heaven and him, that 

feed 
With light from his their eyes, and fill their ears 
"With godlike speech of lips whereon the smile 
Is promise of more perfect manhood, born 
Of happier days than his that knew not him, 
And equal-hearted with the sun in heaven 
From rising even to setting, they shall know 
By type and present likeness of a man 
What, if truth be, truth is, and what, if God, 
God.' 

These are English tributes only, but they are 
the most effective for our purpose because of 
the witness they tear to the fact that Mazzini's 
teaching and example far transcend the limits 
of his own country and the hearing of his own 
compatriots. 

In spite, however, of the praise thus accorded 
Mazzini by ' those who know,' we may still find 
here and there traces of the undercurrent of 
unsympathetic or antagonistic sentiment which 
during his lifetime sought to asperse his mo- 
tives and belittle his achievements. Those who 
sat in the seats of the mighty found his ardent 
propaganda of republicanism — with its direct 
and vital appeal to the spiritual aspect of hu- 
man nature — a force far more difficult to 
combat than the efforts of ordinary revolution- 
ists, and they did their best to create the legend 
which pictured him as a criminal conspirator 
against the established order. Other critics were 
found in those who sought by more direct 
means and practical methods to restore Italy 
to its proper place among the nations, and who, 
with their partisans, endeavored to exalt those 
means and methods as the only ones really 
worth considering, oblivious of the truth tliat 
the moral regeneration which was the object of 
Mazzini's apostol'ate was the underlying cause of 
all that the Risorgimento accomplished — that 
without this renewal of the spirit neither arms 
nor diplomacy would have been of serious avail 
for so great a task. Such critics, in their zeal 
for the glory of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel 
and Garibaldi, have particularly sought to min- 
imize the influence of the man whose silent 
labors prepared the soil for their harvest, and 
alone made possible the success which crowned 
their efforts. But all this ' cloud of detrractions 
Tude' has wellnigh spent its obscuring effect, 
and as the years that knew Mazzini recede from 
our immediate gaze, we may with more and 
more confidence echo the words of his poet : 

'Life and the clouds have vanished; hate and fear 

Have had their span 
Of time to hurt, and are not: he is here, 

The sunlike man.' 



The message of Mazzini, like the message of 
Scihiller, is one of which our own age ia 
peculiarly in need. Divested of its temporal 
accidents, it stands revealed as the quintes- 
sence of Christian ethics, restated in the terms 
of modem social conditions. It is summed up 
in one pregnant phrase, the duties of man, not 
'Conflicting with, but merely complementing, 
that other phrase, the rights of man, to which 
the French Ee volution gave such ringing utter- 
ance. Here is the doctrine, embodied in a 
definition of the religious idea: 

'That idea elevates and purifies the individual; 
dries up the springs of egotism, by changing, 
and removing outside himself the centre of activ- 
ity. It creates for man that theory of duty which 
is the mother of self-sacrifice, which ever was, 
and ever will be, the inspirer of great and noble 
things; a sublime theory, that draws man near 
to God, borrows from the divine nature a spark 
of omnipotence, crosses at one leap all obstacles, 
makes the martyr's scaffold a ladder to victory, 
and is as superior to the narrow, imperfect theory 
(rf rights as the law is superior to one of its 
corollaries. ' 

What a clearing of the moral atmosphere would 
result from an infusion of this spirit into 
the social conflicts of to-day, with their sordid 
selfishness of motive, their petty and ignoble 
aims. To the belief thus formulated at the age 
of thirty, Mazzini adhered throughout his long 
life, never perturbed by passion, but calm in 
the faith that the fundamental rule of himian 
conduct was to be found in this acceptance of 
the claims of duty as paramount. 

' Mine is not the work of a writer,' he said 
in ' Faith and the Future,' ' it is the stem and 
fearless mission of an apostle.' But if it were 
not for Mazzini's writings we should find it 
difficult to understand his immense influence, 
and wellnigh impossible to realize the loftiness 
of his character. These writings are, indeed, 
a precious legacy from the age of political tur- 
moil that gave them shape, and their value has 
by no means lapsed with the historical occasion 
of their production. More enduring than the 
monument at Genoa those fervent appeals to 
the highest instincts of our nature are likely 
to prove, and the Italian government has done 
itself honor in planning a national edition of 
his complete works. If any further excuse than 
this were needed for speaking of him in the 
pages of a literary journal, it might easily be 
found in those of his writings which belong to 
literature pure and simple, in the keen and 
graceful essays which he devotes to Byron and 
Goethe, to Hugo and Lamennais, to Carlyle and 
Benan, and to the great poet of his own race 
whose genius overtops all but the half dozen 
greatest in the history of all literature.

Mr. IiANG*S XiITERARY liOITERINGS.* 



* Young men, especially in America/ saye 
Mr. Lang, * write to me and ask me to recom- 
mend " a course of reading.^' Distrust a course 
of reiading! People who really care for books 
read ail of them. There is no other course. 
Let this be a reply. No other answer shall 
they get from me, the inquiring young men.^ 
If the writer of these words does not convey the 
impression of having himself read quite all lit- 
erature, he at least has a way of giving one a 
sense of the splendid vastness and infinite vari- 
ety of the literary realm. Contrast with his 
tone the somewhat peevish note in an utterance 
of his fellow-countryman. Hume. Writing to 
Gilbert Elliot in 1757, Hume saj-s, referring to 
his ' History,' — ' I undertook this work because 
I was tired of idleness and foimd reading alone, 
after I had perused all good books (which I 
think is soon done), a somewhat languid occu- 
pation.' But poor Hume was writing a hun- 
dred years before the public-library movement 
had well started, and a century and a half be- 
fore Mr. Carnegie's generosity had endeared him 
to the Anglo-Saxon world of readers. Instead 
of lamenting now that all good books can be 
so soon read, one becomes increasingly and de- 
spairingly conscious how many books in how 
many languages are always waiting, indeed 
clamoring, to be read. Reading is likened by 
Mr. Lang to opium-eating: it unlocks to us 
artificial paradises. The comparison might 
have been carried further, in that the daily dose 
has to be steadily increased to satisfy the crav- 
ing of the true lover of reading, who is a very 
different creature from the mere book-lover, or 
book-collector, with whom reading is often the 
last use to which books are to be put. A pas- 
sage depicting some of the charms of reading 
may be quoted from the opening chapter of our 
author's 'Adventures among Books.' He _ is 
speaking of the ancient classics. 

' There is a eh.ann in finding ourselves — our 
common humanity, our puzzles, our cares, our joys, 
in the writings of men severed from us by race, 
religion, speech, and half the gulf of historical 
time — which no other literary pleasure can equal. 
Then there is to be added, as the university 
preacher observed, "the pleasure of despising our 
fellow creatures who do not know Greek." Doubt- 
less in that there is great consolation.' 

The regret is often expressed that the Bible 
has been from our earliest years so often read 
to us and by us, so regularly dinned into our 
ears from the pulpit, and so quoted and para- 

• Adventubes Among Books. By Andrew Lang. With 
portrait. New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



phrased at every turn, that we are incapable, at 
maturity, of appreciating its worth, spiritual 
and literary. Sir. Lang thinks it is much the 
same with Tennyson's poems: use has made 
them too familiar. To the boy Andrew, turning 
in weariness from Tupper's ' Proverbial Phil- 
osophy,' the poet of the Table Round dawned as 
a new light ; ' a new music was audibile, a new 
god came into my medley of a Pantheon, a god 
never to be dethroned.' Concerning our first 
loves in books, the writer says some irue things. 
'People talk, in novels, about the delights of a 
first love. One may venture to doubt whether 
everybody exactly knows which was his, or her, 
first love, of men or women, but about our first 
loves in books there can be no mistake. They 
were, and remain, the dearest of all; after boy- 
hood the bloom is off the literary rye. . . As 
long as we live we hope to read, but we "never can 
recapture the first fine, careless rapture." Besides, 
one begins to write, and that is fatal. My own 
first essays were composed at school — for other 
boys. Not long ago the gentleman who was then 
our English master wrote to me, informing me he 
was my earliest public, and that he had never 
credited my younger brother with the essays which 
that unscrupulous lad ("I speak of him but 
brotherly") was accustomed to present for his con- 
sideration. ' 

Mr, Lang's recollections of Stevenson are 
among the best things in his book. Although 
not of Stevenson's closest friends, he was inti- 
mate enough to feel the full charm of his bril- 
liant junior. Here is his impression of the 
young man as he first saw him in 1873 : 

'He looked as, in my eyes, he always did look, 
more like a lass than a lad, with a rather long, 
smooth oval face, brown hair worn at greater 
length than is common, large, lucid eyes, but 
whether blue or brown I cannot remember, if brown, 
certainly light brown. On appealing to the author- 
ity of a lady, I learn that brown was the hue. His 
colour was a trifle hectic, as is not unusual at 
Mentone, but he seemed, under his big blue cloak, 
to be of slender, yet agile frame. He was like 
nobody else whom I ever met. There was a sort 
of uncommon celerity in changing expression, in 
thoug'ht and speech.' 

And yet this smooth-faced, girlish-looking 
youngster was brimful of pluck. ' In Paris at 
a cafe,' narrates Mr. Lang, ' I remember that 
Mr. Stevenson heard a Frenchman say the Eng- 
lish were cowards. He got up and slapped the 
man's face. " Monsieur, vous m'avez f rappe," 
said the Gaul. "A ce qu'il parait," said the 
Scot, and there it ended.' To Stevenson life 
was a drama, ' and he delighted, like his own 
British admirals, to do things with a certain 
air.' He was possessed with the inextinguish- 
able childish passion for making believe, and 
it remained with him to the end. ' I have a 
theory,' says Mr. Lang, ' that all children pos- 
sess genius, and that it dies out in the general- 
ity of mortals, abiding only with people whose 
genius the world is forced to recognize. Mr.

Stevenson illustrates, and perhaps partly sug- 
gested, this private philosophy of mine.' But 
the theory is by no means so private a posses- 
sion as the author seems to think. 

Of American writers, Hohnes and Hawthorne 
are deemed worthy of a Chapter apiece. With 
somewhat superfluous particularity Mr. Lang 
explains why he cannot reckon Dr. Holmes 
among the very great authors. No one pr&- 
eumes so to estimate him, and the Scotch critic 
does him ample honor in classing him with Dr. 
Thomas Browne, Dr. John Brown, and Dr. S. 
Weir Mitchell, as representing 'the physician 
in humane letters.' In this essay the writer in- 
cidentally refers to ' the witch-burning, periwig- 
hating, doctrinal Judge Sewall.' The epithet 
* witch-burning ' might be suffered to pass as a 
conventional and convenient fashion of speak- 
ing ; but in the later chapter on Hawthorne Mr. 
Lang's evil genius has made him write ' of those 
judges who burned witches and persecuted 
Quakers.' It must be that our learned author, 
on mature reflection, will remember that witch- 
burning was never a New England pastime, or 
crime. The utmost limit to which the Salem 
frenzy went was the hanging of certain persons 
for alleged undue familiarity with the powers 
of darkness. Nineteen unfortunates thus met 
their fate on Gallows Hill, and a twentieth, old 
Giles Corey, was pressed to death for refusing to 
plead. Toward the end of this interesting paper 
on Holmes, the author appears to be guilty of 
something akin to the putting on of erudite 
airs with no sufiicient cause. He says of the 
Doctor, 'How far he maintained his scholar- 
ship, I am not certain; but it is odd that, in 
his preface to " The Guardian Angel," he 
should quote from "Jonathan Edwards the 
younger " a story for which he might have cited 
Aristotle.' Has not that a very impressive ap- 
pearance of superior learning, of an enviable 
familiarity with the writings of the Stagirite? 
But turn to the preface in question, and there 
you will find a footnote duly explaining that 
'the original version of this often-repeated 
story [which the author has just told] may be 
found in Aristotle's Ethics, Book 7th, Chapter 
7th,' However, it is not beyond the limits of 
possibility that this note was lacking in the copy 
of the book read by Mr. Lang, or that it was 
overlooked by him, or that he recorded its sub- 
stance and afterward, in a moment of forgetful- 
ness, credited the item to his own critical acu- 
men, or finally that he read and remembered 
the note and yet wrote with no intention to 
deceive. He is at liberty to retort, if he wishes, 
with an ' honi soit qui mal y pense.* 

Mr. Lang's relish for Hawthorne is notewor- 
thy and commendable ; but he perhaps does him 
a little injustice in the following passage: 



'It is curious to mark Hawthorne's attempts to 
break away from himself — from the man that 
heredity, and circumstance, and the divine gift of 
genius had made him. He naturally "haunts the 
mouldering lodges of the past"; but when he 
came to England (where such lodges are abundant), 
he was ill-pleased and cross-grained. He knew that 
a long past, with mysteries, dark places, malisons, 
curses, historic wrongs, was the proper atmosphere 
of his art. But a kind of conscientious desire to 
be something other than himself — something more 
ordinary and popular — made him thank Heaven 
that his chosen atmosphere was rare in his native 
land. He grumbled at it, when he was in the 
midst of it; he grumbled in England; and how he 
grumbled in Rome! He permitted the American 
Eagle to make her nest in his bosom, "with the 
customary infirmity of temper that characterises 
this unhappy fowl," as he says in his essay, "The 
Custom House." ' 

A trenchant criticism on 'The Scarlet Letter' 
is worth quoting. 

'The persons in an allegory may be real enooigh, 
as Bunyan has proved by examples. But that cul- 
pable clergyman, Mr. Arthur Dimmesdale, with his 
large, white brow, his melancholy eyes, his hand 
on his heart, and his general resemblance to the 
High Church Curate in Thackeray's "Our Street," 
is he real? To me he seems very unworthy to be 
Hester's lover, for she is a beautiful woman of 
flesh and blood. Mr. Dimmesdale was not only 
immoral; he was unsportsmanlike. He had no more 
pluck than a church-mouse. His miserable passion 
was degraded by its brevity; how could he see this 
woman's disgrace for seven long years, and never 
pluck up heart either to share her shame or pec- 
care fortiterf He is a lay figure, very cleverly but 
somewhat conventionally made and painted. The 
vengeful husband of Hester, Roger Chillingworth, 
is a Mr. Casaubon stung into jealous anger. . . . 
The person of Roger ChilUngworth and his conduct 
are a little too melodramatic for Hawthorne's 
genius. ' 

A considerable number of excellent plots for 
novels and tales are unthriftily given to the 
public in tliis book — because of the plot-maker's 
constitutional inability (so he thinks) to write 
fiction. 'Unluckily,' he sadly confesses, 'my 
brain is not capable of this aesthetic malady, and 
to slave my life, or to "milk a fine warm cow 
rain," as the Zulus say, I could not write a 
novel, or even a short story.' And again, 'As 
Mr. Stevenson says, a man must view " his very 
trifling enterprise with a gravity that would be- 
fit the cares of empire, and think the smallest 
improvement worth accomplishing at any ex- 
pense of time and industry. The book, the 
statue, the sonata, must be gone upon with 
the unreasoning good faith and the unflagging 
spirit of children at their play." This is true; 
that is the worst of it. The man, the writer, 
over whom the irresistible desire to mock at 
himself, his work, his puppets and their for- 
tune, has power, will never be a novelist. The 
novelist must " make believe very much " ; he 
must be in earnest ^^dth his characters. But how 
to be in earnest, how to keep the note of dis-

belief and derision " out of the memorial " ? 
Ah, there is the difficult)', but it is a difficulty 
of which many authors appear to be insensible. 
Perhaps they suffer from no such temptations.' 
One author, however, who could mock at his 
puppets and yet write successful novels, will 
pr^^ly occur to the reader. The very charm 
of ' Vanity Fair ' is partly due to Thackeray's 
refusal to take himself too seriously. 

Last and among the best of Mr. Lang's essays 
is one on *The Boy.^ For awful examples of 
priggish precocity we are referred to the boy- 
hood of John Stuart Mill, and to that of Bishop 
Thirlwall, who *at four read Greek with an 
ease and fluency which astonished all who heard 
him,' at seven wrote an essay ' On the Uncer- 
tainty of Human Life,' and at eleven published 
a volume of * Primitiae ' which went through 
three editions in two years. His infant ser- 
mons, thirty-nine in number — ^the same as the 
Articles — occupy most of this small volume. 
Listen to the little preacher of ten as he piously 
deplores the latter-day desecration of the Sab- 
bath. ' I confess,' Ee sdghs, ' when I look upon 
the present and past state of our public morals, 
and when I contrast our present luxury, dissi- 
pation, and depravity, with past frugality and 
virtue, I feel not merely a sensation of regret, 
but also of terror for the result of the change.' 
One marvels that such a child survived his in- 
fancy. Other chapters of * Adventures,' which 
can here be little more than named, have to do 
with * Bab's Friends,' *Mr. Morris's Poems' — 
especially the earlier ones, which Mr. Lang 
thinks the best,—' Mrs. Eadcliffe's Novels,' * A 
Scottish Romanticist of 1830 ' — ^to wit, Thomas 
T. Stoddart, angler and poet, — 'The Confes- 
sions of Saint Augustine' — wherein a curious 
parallel is drawn between Augustine and Catul* 
lus,—' Smollett,' 'The Paradise of Poets,' 
'Paris and Helen,' 'Enchanted Cigarettes' — 
literar}' projects that one dreams over but never 
executes, — 'The Supernatural in Fiction,' and 
'An Old Scottish Psychical Researcher,' discov- 
ered in the person of Greorge Sinclair, profes- 
sor of philosophy at Glasgow in the latter half 
of the seventeenth century. 

Those who have a taste for books about books 
will hunt long before they will find one more 
tickling to the palate than Mr. Lang's ' Adven- 
tures among Books.' These chapters, it is true, 
are reprints of magazine articles, but mostly of 
a date sufficiently remote to make their reap- 
pearance practically equivalent to a fresh ap- 
pearance. The fine frontispiece portrait in pho- 
togravure is after a painting by Sir William 
Richmond, R.A., which, we are told, ' was done 
about the time when most of the Essays were 
written — and that was not yesterday.'

The Troubled Tax-e of Erin.* 



The persistence of Irish nationality is one of 
tiie marvels of history. Wave after wave of 
invasion has roUed over the island from legend- 
ary times to recent centuries, yet after each in- 
vasion the country and people were still pre- 
dominantly Irish. Internal warfare decimated 
its population in the middle ages; thousands 
perished later in the vain effort to dislodge the 
English conqueror; half a million Irish exiles 
fell on Continental battle-fields in the eight- 
eenth century; hundreds of thousands died 
yearly in the terrible period of famine in the 
early part of Queen Victoria's reign; several 
millions found homes in our own country; and 
yet, after all these ages of national discourage- 
ment, Ireland is still Irish and the Celtic spirit 
seems as vigorous and defiant as ever. 

It is only natural that in a country like ours, 
where the Hibernian element is so numerous, 
there should be a demand for some reliable 
popular account of the Irish past. Two new 
histories have recently been offered to the pub- 
lic, both of which aim to supply such a narra- 
tive. Mr. Charles Johnston and Miss Carita 
Spencer have written 'Ireland's Story' in a 
volume of four hundred pages. Mr. John F. 
Finerty has given us a ' People's History of 
Ireland,' in two volumes of nearly five hun- 
dred pages each. Both histories are properly 
bound in green. 

At first sight the volume entitled ' Ireland's 
Story' gives the impression of having been 
written for text-book purposes; and no doubt 
it win be extensively used in schools having an 
Irish Catholic patronage. It is well provided 
with portraits and illustrations, nearly all of 
which have historic value; it has maps, mar- 
ginal notes, summaries, and an excellent index, 
— in fact, practically all the pedagogical helps 
that one expects to find in the more recent text- 
books. But the book will also interest the gen- 
eral reader. Written in a quiet, almost gentle 
style, the narrative moves calmly forward and 
is easily followed. The authors make no effort 
to conceal the fact that they have looked at 
events from a Catholic view-point; still, the 
treatment is sufficiently fair and charitable to 
satisfy any reader in whom the virtue of tol- 
erance is properly developed. It seems, how- 
ever, that in thtir selection of facts to be pre- 
sented they have studiously avoided almost 
ever}'thing that would tend to discredit the 
Church. Xo reference whatever is made to the • 
papal bull that authorized Henry 11. to seize 
Ireland. Certain writers have, it is true, ar-

goied that this is a matter of slight importance, 
as the pope had no authority to transfer the 
Green Isle to Henry or to any other king. It 
is well known, however, that the current doc- 
trine in the twelfth century as regards papal 
supremacy was totally different. 

No one can make the history of Ireland a 
joyous tale. With so much of treachery, mis- 
ery, and injustice that must be related, the nar- 
rative is likely to be a gloomy one. Yet our 
authors have succeeded in telling a fairly cheer- 
ful story after all. Their purpose is not to 
dwell on what Ireland has endured, but on what 
she has accomplished. The legendary age and 
the early mediaeval period — the period of saints 
and scholars and missionaries, of Patrick and 
Bridget and warlike Columba — are treated 
with a fulness that is almost disproportionate. 
On the other hand, the eighteenth century, a 
time when the Irish Catholic was deprived of 
almost every opportunity and right but the bare 
permission to exist, is treated with all possible 
brevity. The book closes with four interesting 
chapters in which are reviewed the achieve- 
ments of the Irish race in America, in England, 
and on the Continent, and also what has been 
accomplished in the Irish home land in the 
literary field. 

When the reader turns from this finished 
product of the Riverside Press to the more ex- 
tensive * People's History of Ireland,' the im- 
pression received is not the most favorable. The 
print and the paper are not of the best; the 
time-honored preface and the index are want- 
ing; aside from frontispiece portraits of O'Con- 
nell and Parnell, there are no illustrations; a 
solitary map of modem Ireland is all that is 
offered on the geographical side, the map being 
good but inadequate. 

But after reading a few pages one discovers 
that this is not the dry book it seems to be. 
The author has had a varied literary experi- 
ence as editor, lecturer, author, and spell- 
binder, and when writing on the subject of his 
native country Mr. Finerty is utterly incapable 
of being dull. It will not do to say that his 
style is everywhere excellent; in places the lan- 
guage gives evidence of loose and hasty writ- 
ing; some of the expressions used are sadly 
worn, while others lack in point of delicacy; 
but the sentences have fire and vigor, and the 
author employs a great variety of expedients 
to rouse and impress his readers. Melodious 
lines from Thomas Moore, tender stanzas from 
Thomas Davis, frequent anecdotes illustrative 
of Irish humor and genial wit, occasional cita- 
tions from what is best in Irislh oratory, — all 
these and other forms of embellishment are 
freely used and give a distinctly Celtic coloring 
to the pages. 



The narrative is punctuated at regular inter- 
vals with sharp explosions of the author's anger 
and indignation. In speaking of the corrupt 
methods used by the English in dealing with 
the Anglo-Irish toward the close of Elizabeth's 
reign, he says : 

'The bait took as might have been expected — 
for every good cause has its Iseariots — and we 
soon hear of jealous kinsmen of the patriot chiefs 
"coming over to" the queen's interest and doing 
their uttermost — the heartless scoundrels — to 
divide and distract the strength of their country, 
engaged in a deadly struggle for her rights and 
liberty. These despicable wretches are foul blotches 
on the pages of Ireland's history.' 

In the same fashion he characterizes Queen 
Anne, ' the unnatural creature she was,' and 
tells of George I. whose 'black career termi- 
nated in 1742,' and how ' a weight of horror 
was lifted from Ireland's heart when the wel- 
come news of his death spread rapidly, far and 
wide, over the persecuted country.' In sim- 
ilar language he expresses his admiration for 
George III., Lord Castlereagh, the Duke of 
Wellington, and many others. In fact, if an 
artist were to draw imaginary portraits of Eng- 
land's public men from Henry II. to Edward 
VII., using Mr. Finerty's descriptions and 
characterizations as his only guides, we should 
have a gallery of monstrous caricatures the 
sight of which would strike John Bull speech- 
less. 

But when our author introduces the great 
worthies of Irish history, the O'Feills, the 
O'Connells, and the O'Briens, with Grattan, 
Emmet, Moore, and the rest, he uses a wholly 
different vocabulary. But here, too, we must 
be cautious in accepting his estimates, as en- 
thusiastic praise is not always evidence of calm 
judgment. He quotes the orator Walter Burgh 
as declaring that ' England has sown her laws 
as dragons' teeth and they have sprung up 
armed men.' Of this tattered metaphor our 
author says : * This magnificent allusion to the 
rise and progress of the Irish volunteer move- 
ment is one of the finest passages in the oratory 
of ancient and modern times.' It is state- 
ments such as this that make the reader sus- 
picious. 

It is generally believed that a writer of his- 
tory should approach his subject with an open 
and unprejudiced mind; that he should take 
the position of a judge whose duty and desire 
are to ascertain the truth in the given case. 
Such a historian Mr. Finerty is never likely to 
become. He, the Irish radical who has urged 
Irish independence in season and out of sea- 
son, whose published utterances of thirty years 
bear the stamp of an uu weakening radicalism, 
who heads a great organization of Irishmen the 
spirit of which is anything but conciliatory, —

he of all men would seem by nature unfitted to 
write a trustworthy history of his native land. 
He is not a judge, he is an advocate, a bril- 
liant, forceful, relentless advocate; but what 
the world wants is not a plea but a calm judicial 
statement of a complicated case. 

In the preparation of his history Mr. Fin- 
erty seems to have used secondary accounts verj* 
largely; in the first volume there is, indeed, 
little evidence that the sources have been used. 
The author does not, however, show an absorb- 
ing interest in the earlier period; he is at- 
tracted by the great political and parliamentary 
struggle with England that began in the eight- 
eenth century and continued down to the close 
of Pamell's career. Of this struggle he gives 
an extended and readable account, the entire 
second volume being devoted to the century fol- 
lowing the commercial emancipation of Ireland 
in 1780. Of the two volumes this is the more 
valuable. It tells what Ireland suffered 
throughout the nineteenth century, what her 
people strove for, and what they accomplished; 
and as Mr. Finerty has for years been in close 
touch with all the various movements in Ire- 
land, a measure of authority is added to his 
statements which the *reader is compelled to 
respect. It is to be regretted that this thor- 
ough presentation has not been continued 
down to date. The last thirty-five years of 
Irish history — the period of the Land League 
and the Home Rule movement — are summed up 
in a single chapter of seventeen pages. 

Bound up closely with the history of Ire- 
land is that of England; and on the English 
side of his work Mr. Finerty has failed to be 
accurate and just. We are told, for instance, 
that Thomas Cromwell was a churchman, and 
that Praise-God Barebone presided over the 
parliament that bears his name. Trifling 
though such errors are, they show that the au- 
thor has not read his English history so care- 
fully as he should have done. Attention has 
already been called to his estimates of Eng- 
land's great statesmen; in much the same way 
does he treat the nation at large. It must be 
conceded that England's record in Ireland is 
not altogether lovely, and it is not surprising 
that strong terms are used in discussing it. 
And yet England is not wholly to blame for 
what Ireland has suffered. If there had been 
any national spirit, any broad patriotism, in the 
Celtic people in the middle ages, the Conqueror 
might have been repulsed. If the Irishman of 
modem times had not listened too eagerly to 
every disturl>er of Vae world's peace, his lot 
would have been more endurable. It is true 
that Mr. Finerty does find an occasional oppor- 
tunity to say a good word for some English- 
men, but it is too frequently done in a per- 



functory and spiritless manner. It seems pos- 
sible that justice could be accorded England 
without in any way diminishing the glory of 
Ireland. If Mr. Finerty had studied the his- 
tory of his native land in the light of European 
events, the policies of England would have be- 
come intelligible to him, and the ' People's His- 
tory of Ireland' would have been a far more 
trustworthy work. Laubence M. Labson. 



Balzac's IiAtest Biographeb.* 



If a reader were to make a mental catalogue 
of the most romantic and startling fiction that 
has been written in modem times, it is doubtful 
if he oould name a single tale more dramatic, 
more improbable if judged by severe standards, 
than the actual career of Honore de Balzac. 
The life of this man was a summary of the 
many strange personalities and inddents that 
are found in Ms partially recorded ' Comedie 
Humaine.' He seemed to justify his own state- 
ment that genius is never quite sane, for few 
would question either Balzac's possession of 
genius or his lack of poise. With an exaggera- 
tion that has much of truth at its root, he 
analyzed his own character for the Duchesse 
d'Abrantes. 

*I possess, shut up in my five foot eight inches, 
all the incoherences, all the contrasts possible; ana 
those who think me vain, extravagant, obstinate, 
high-minded, without connection in my ideas, — a 
fop, negligent, idle, without application, without 
reflection, without any constancy; a chatterbox, 
without tact, badly brought up, impolite, whimsical, 
unequal in temper, — are quite as right as those 
who perhaps say that I am economical, modest, 
courageous, stingy, energetic, a worker, constant, 
silent, full of delicacy, polite, always gay. — Does 
this kaleidoscope exist, because in the soul of 
those who claim to paint all the affections of the 
human heart, chance throws all these affections 
themselves, so that they may be able, by the force- 
of their imagination, to feel what they paint?" 

In Miss Mary F. Sandare's newly-published 
life of the prince of realists are recorded many 
phases, intimate and varied, of this complex 
character. Though the author has had access to 
some unpublished bits of personalia, especially 
such as have come into the possession of M. de 
Spoelbereh de Lovenjoul, and though she has 
used freely and with good taste the later letters 
to Mme. Hanska, the volume fails in many re- 
spects to equal the excellent Memoir by Miss^ 
Wormele}'. The reader, challenged by the 
words in Miss Sandars's preface that Mis^ 
Wormele}''s book ' was written at a time when 
little was known about the great novelist,' and

[June 16, 



reviewing this exhaustive Memoir which intro- 
duced many of us to the true Balzac, finds much 
to admire anew in the earlier biographer's wise 
and scholarly treatment, her careful quotations 
from many original sources, and her skilfully 
condensed sentences of analysis. At the same 
time, this new contribution to Balzac study is 
interesting and valuable. Its form is attractive, 
its illustrations are good, and its sympathetic 
tone is alluring and generally well-balanced. 
There are exliaustive details of the novelist's un- 
successful monetary ventures. The last portion 
of the work is excellent in its interest and se- 
quence. The acknowledged gaps and mysterious 
lapses in the narrative, impossible for any biog- 
rapher to fill during the periods of Balzac's 
obscure retirements, show how much he needed 
£i Boswell to record his vagaries. 

To the sister of Balzac, Laure Surville, who 
deserves a high place in that list of sisters 
whose influences have been vital on so many 
authors, we are deeply indebted for reminis- 
cences and anecdotes of family traits, and for 
many a secret episode in the boyhood and ma- 
turity of the novelist. Miss Sandars has well 
emphasized the sane affection and guidance of 
this sister. Throughout the brother's life her 
devotion was often his salvation from financial 
and mental disaster. His nervous mother found 
this son, so truly inheritor of many of her own 
faults of temper, a constant source of irritation. 
With new realization of their importance, we 
read here of the influences exerted on Balzac's 
life and writings by many women-friends of 
varying types. At the homes of Mme. de Bemy, 
Mme, Carraud, and the famous Delpihine Girar- 
din, he gained not alone social pleasure but also 
literary stimulus and material, especially for 
his settings of higher social life. His flirtation 
with the coy Mme. de Castries developed his 
emotional faculty into unwonted vigor, and gave 
theme for fictional plot and character-drawing 
in ' La Duchesse de Langeais,' ' Le Medecin de 
Campagne,' and other novels. The woman, 
Mme. Hanska, who was to beiar his name after 
years of courtship and passionate longing on his 
part, by her cold heart in her later relations with 
her lover arouses our indignation; but she was 
his good angel when in 1832 she wrote him 
urging with feeling that he should recall him- 
self from the pruriency and extravagance of his 
latest work and keep steadily in mind the pur- 
ity as well as the strength of his best writings. 
The years immediately following this new in- 
fluence are associated in memory with two of 
Balzac's most perfect and popular novels, ' Eu- 
genie Grandet ' and ' Le Pere Goriot.' At first 
he doubted the truth of the tribute called forth 



by these two novels, but later accepted the de- 
cree of his critical friends, — ■ an estimate which 
the later decades have verified. 

Just as Balzac had gained this lofty rank as 
author, just as he seemed about to free himself 
from the hounds of poverty and debt which had 
haunted his life thus far, he committed two 
errors of judgment wMch proved disastrous 
both to fame and fortune. We are reminded 
of Fenimore Cooper and his quarrels with the 
press, as the biographer cites Balzac's contro- 
versies with both printers and editors. The 
second folly was the visionary extravagance of 
'Les Jardies,' the residence erected with lofty 
ideas and unsupported walls. At this crisis he 
turned yet again to the plan cherished for many 
years, — to write a great drama which shoidd 
retrieve his fortunes and establish his fame. 
Of late, critics have found no little merit in 
some of Balzac's dramas, especially 'Vautrin' 
and ' Pamela Giraud.' The amusing tale of his 
efforts to waken the unfit collaborator, Lassailly, 
out of a sound sleep to give him tragic situa- 
tions, uatil the youth was almost driven mad, 
justifies Miss Sandars's comment on 'the wide 
gulf which separates l^alzac the writer, with 
psychological powers which almost amounted to 
second sight, and Balzac in ordinary life, many 
of whose misfortunes had their origin in an 
apparent want of knowledge of human nature, 
which caused him to make deplorable mistakes 
in choosing his associates.' 

Much space is given to the lesser-known years 
of Balzac's life, the pathetic ending when he 
waited patiently but desperately for Mme. 
Hanska's consent to marriage, his health fast 
failing and his will concentrated on the later 
worlvs of marvellous power, ' Les Paysans/ ' La 
Cousine Bette,' and ' Le Cousin Pons.' It was 
the natural revenge of abused nature that ended 
this turbulent life at its prime. The records of 
those thirty years of industry, productive of 
more than four-score novels with numberless 
other writings, furnish their own comment. 
Though Miss Sandars's book is confessedly a 
study of personality, with meagre attempt at 
literary or critical estimate, in the final pages 
she considers, with discrimination, Balzac's rank 
as realist, compared especially with Flaubert and 
Zola. There is resemblance to Shakespeare in 
his recognized power to create strong types that 
are also individuals. He had 'the gift of see- 
ing vividly — as under a dazzling light — ^to the 
very kernel of the object stripped of supernu- 
merary circumstance,' yet he was kin of the 
Eomantieists 'in his feeling for the beauty of 
atmospheric effects.'

SciEXCE AXD Personality.* 



Bath by resemblance and by contrast, Profes- 
sor Miinsterberg's essay reminds us of the dia- 
logue in the church in Morris's ' Dream of 
John Ball/ It is the record of a supposed con- 
versation between two friends, who have just 
returned from burjing the body of a third. A 
conversation, I call it, but one of them does all 
the talking, while the other offers silent but 
clearly expressed comment. It is written in a 
charming manner, and is really a description of 
the author's philosophy. 

The argument is this: Science is a method 
of interpreting experiences so that they stand 
in a definite relation toward one another, the 
conceptions of time and space, cause and effect, 
being necessary to bring order out of what would 
otherwise be chaos, ' The scientist connects the 
things of this chaotic world in an orderly sys- 
tem of causes and effects which follow one an- 
other; and, as he can do his work only if he 
i&kes for granted that the end can be reached, 
he considers the world of objects as a system 
in which ever3-thing must be understood as the 
effect of causes.' In reality, science can say 
nothing about ourselves, who make the sciences ; 
but it is possible, and for some purposes neces- 
sary, to regard ourselves in a purely objective 
manner, and then, ' all the ideas and imagina- 
tions, feelings and emotions, go on in the brain 
just as it rains and snows in the outer world, 
and our own will is a necessary product of its 
forgoing causes. Such consistency is admirable 
in its realm, but it must not make us forget that 
its realm is determined by our own decision, 
yes, that it is our own free will which decides 
for a certain purpose to conceive ourselves as 
bound, our will as a causal process.' Time and 
space relate not to personality, but merely ex- 
press attitudes of personality towards its objects. 
The real personality no more occupies time than 
space ; * my real life as a system of interrelated 
will-attitudes has nothing before or after, be- 
cause it is beyond time.' Eegarding existence as 
a mere series of phenomena in time, it could not 
have any value for anyone. Time is a system 
in wliich the reality of one moment excludes 
the reality of all others ; only the present exists, 
the past is irrevocably gone, the future is not 
yet. Personality is not thus self-devouring, and 
extension in time would have no more value 
than extension in space: 'a mere expansion, 
a more and more of phenomena in space and 
time, is a valueless amassing of indifferent and 
purposeless material.' History may be con- 
ceived as the description of a great causal 
mechanism, in which everything follows of

ton : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



necessity; but this is merely science, and the 
true historian sees rather the play of will upon 
will, each compelling acknowledgment, demand- 
ing agreement or disagreement, obedience or 
combat. The resulting phenomena are arranged 
by science in a time-series, but the wills them- 
selves are the expression of judgments which 
are independent of time. ' If you insist on 
metaphors, I should liken our will to a circle; 
a circle has no beginning and it has no end; it 
is endless, infinite.' What, then, is the value of 
such a will-life? Its value consists in itself and 
the ends it recognizes, which are absolute, not 
relative. Thus, ' truth . . does not allow any 
further question as to whether or not it is 
useful for s(wnething else, but it is itself the 
end of all questioning. Only that which is such 
an ultimate end for us is really a value.' Onr 
goal is not endless duration, but 'complete re- 
pose in the perfect satisfaction which the will 
finds when it has reached the significance, the in- 
fluence, and the value at which it is aiming.'" 
However, each one of ns is more than merely an 
individual, and the ultimate realization of our 
aims can be found only in the totalitj- of wills, 
or ' the over-individual consciousness, the over- 
soul.' ' If we were to substitute for that empty 
thought of a continuation of time the deeper 
thought of an endless personal influence of vrill, 
endless not in time but endless in personal rela- 
tions, it would seem as if we had really ex- 
pressed an ultimate goal.' Yet to realize the 
totality of this proce^ would be to destroy the 
very thing which makes our individual person- 
alihr, and the impossibility of complete achieve- 
ment gives meaning to our striving. ' This con- 
trast between what is aimed at in our attitude 
and what is reached in our influence is indeed 
full of pathos, yet inexhaustible in its eternal 
value.' 

So much by way of description. For myself, 
the Miinsterbergian philosophy seems to con- 
tain much that is of value, and yet in its totality 
to be strangely meaningless. It is quite possible 
to regard time and space as merely modes of 
extension, independent of duration. At any 
moment of time, things are varied only in 
space ; at any point in space, things are varied 
only in time. Thus the universe may be per- 
manent in all its features, and our personalities 
the only things capable of change, and that by 
the succession of experiences due to motion 
through phenomena. If this motion were on a 
certain plane always in one direction, or along 
the arc of a circle, the effect would be that of 
time, with its succession of events said to be 
related as cause to effect. Are not things in 
space always similarly related? The physicist 
recognizes that every atom is influenced by every 
other, and is in fact held in its place by the

totality of forces in the universe; a relation 
exactly as binding as between successive events. 
At each moment, things ha\"e to be what they 
are; and in ultimate analysis we find ourselves 
simply saying, ' What is, is/ 

According to such a view, our personality 
might be thought of as independent of time and 
space in the sense that it moved irrespective of 
them; and yet finding its being in the reality 
of experiences understandable only as based on 
projected phenomena. One could postulate a 
latent personality, like latent energy, losing all 
power of motion througih phenomena, and con- 
sequently of receiving successive experiences; 
but such latency would be pure dormancy, and 
if perm'anent extinction. The complete attain- 
ment of the desired experiences would naturally 
result in such a cessation of motion, were it per- 
manent, since any departure from the point 
gained would be detrimental. Thus the Bud- 
dhist idea of Nirvana would be the logical out- 
come of such a theory, as also the idea of the 
necessity for continued search while attainment 
remiained incomplete. The very conception of 
God^s life in Christ depends upon the thought 
that experience is only purchased at the expense 
of imperfection of attainment, though not neces- 
sarily imperfection of aim. Here is the neces- 
sary pathos which Professor Miinsterberg de- 
scribes in his closing words. 

The fault I find with Professor Miinsterberg's 
philosophy is really this : that it pretends to get 
rid of time and space in considering personal- 
ity, and yet does not do so, and cannot, in the 
nature of things. Our mental make-up is a 
totality which cannot be divided in the way 
proposed, and while we must necessarily recog- 
nize the truth of much that he urges, we seem, 
in the attempt to grasp his complete meaning, 
to be lost in a mere maze of words. Who can 
speak of 'the eternal life,' and get away from 
the thought of time? Who can think of 'an 
endless personal influence of will,' and get away 
from time and space? There may be truths 
which we cannot grasp, but the psychologist 
should be the last to suggest the practicability 
of building a philosophy independent of the one 
element which gives phenomena their reality 
for us. T. D. A. Cockerell. 



Echoes from the Eastern Struggle.* 



The Libraiy of Congress has published, in 
a sumptuous form altogether unlike the generality 
of the productions of that institution, a 'Catalog 
of the Gardiner Greene Hubbard Collection of 
Engravings' compiled by Mr. Arthur Jeffrey Par- 
sons. This collection, which was presented to the 
Library of Congress by Mrs. Hubbard, contains 
2,707 prints, representing many schools, the French, 
German, English, Dutch, and Italian examples mak- 
ing up about nine-tenths of the whole. Besides the 
catalogue proper, the volume contains a sketch of 
the donor, a series of ten plates, and elaborate 
indexes. 



Two grievances gleam wearily through the 
pages of the volume entitled ' Following the 
Sun-Flag,' by Mr. John Fox, Jr. These are 
that the author was not permitted to see any- 
thing of the actual fighting in the earlier land 
battles of the Russo-Japanese war, leaving Liao- 
Yang just as the heavy fighting was beginning; 
and that the Mikado's officers did not tell him 
the truth, according to any occidental notions of 
wihat it is that constitute verity. Deprived of 
opportunity for accomplishing the purposes 
which took him to the Bast, denied all chance of 
informing the world of the actual struggle which 
he went to see, he has been compelled to con- 
tent himself with describing, in his own vivid 
and picturesque manner, the details of his five 
months' tedious waiting in Tokio and as many 
weeks with his fellow-correspondents from 
America, England, France, and Italy, on the 
trail of the Japanese armies in Manchuria. He 
has made the work interesting by the sketchy, 
breezy manner in which it is written, although 
it is imbued with that fine race prejudice against 
men of darker skin which is the heritage of the 
Anglo-Saxon in general and of the Southern- 
born American in particular. Of the spirit of 
the Japanese people in their heroic struggle, 
Mr. Fox has much to say. 

'The women let their hair go undressed once a 
month, that they may contribute the price of the 
dressing — five sen. A gentleman discovered that 
every servant in his household, from butler down, 
was contributing a certain amount of his wages 
each month, and in consequence offered to raise 
wages just the amount each servant was giving 
awaj*. The answer was, "Sir, we cannot allow that; 
it is an honor for us to give, and it would be you 
who would be doing our duty for us to Japan." 

'A Japanese lady apologized profusely for being 
late to dinner. She had been to the station to see 
her son off for the front, where there were already 
three of her sons. Said another straightway, ' ' How 
fortunate to be able to give four sons to Japan!" 

'Hundreds and thousands of families are deny- 
ing themselves one meal a day that they may give 
more to their country. And one rich merchant, 
who has already given 100,000 yen, has himself cut 
off one meal, and declares that he will if necessary 
live on one the rest of his life for the sake of 
Japan. ' 

Describing a pretty little girl in one of the 
houses where he lodged, Mr. Fox says : 

'Among the thousands of applications, many of 
them written in blood, which the war office has 
received from men who are anxious to go to the 
front, is one from just such a girl. In her letter 
she said that she was the last of an old Samurai

family. Her father was killed in the war with 
China; her only brother died during the Boxer 
troubles. She begged to be allowed to take her 
place in the ranks which had always belonged to 
hen family. She could shoot, she said, and ride; 
and it would be a lasting disgrace if her family 
name should be missing from the rolls, where it 
has had an honored place for centuries, now that 
her country and her Emperor are in such sore need.' 

Mr. Eichard Barry was more fartunate than 
Mr. Fox. Representing a number of periodicals 
in England, and America, from the pages of 
•which the materials for his book on Port 
Arthur have been taken, Mr. Barry saw all the 
later fighting before Port Arthur, and was a wit- 
ness to its surrender. The heroism of both Eus- 
sians and Japanese is freely attested, although 
it is in the latter that he finds the larger share, 
since he was their guest and within their lines. 
This book is that of an eye-witness profoundly 
and sympathetically impressed, still young 
enough to have every impression deep and clear, 
and old enough to set it down justly and vividly. 
He, like Mr. Fox, has the skill of seizing upon 
illustrative episodes, of which we take a few 
examples. 

' The Russians made a sortie into the plain, parad- 
ing for several hundred yards in front of the Two 
Dragons. That was before the lines were as closely 
drawn as they are now, and the Japanese looked 
with amusement on the show-off. At the head 
marched two bands, brassing a brilliant march. 
Then came the colors flashing in the sun. The 
officers were dashingly decorated, and the troops 
wore colored caps. It was a rare treat for the 
Japanese, for they had never seen anything like 
that in their own army. Like a boy bewildered at 
the gay plumage of a bird he might not otherwise 
catch, the simple and curious Japanese let the foe 
vaingloriously march back into the town.' 

Of the commander of the Mikado's forces dur- 
ing the siege, much is said by Mr. Barry. 

'We expected to meet a man of iron, — for Nogi 
is the general whose eldest son, a lieutenant in the 
Second Army, was killed at Nanshan; who has 
under his command a second son, a lieutenant; and 
who wrote home after the first disaster, "Hold the 
funeral rites until Hoten and I return, when yon 
can bury three at once." 

'The General received us in his garden. He was 
at a small table, under a willow, working with a 
magnifying glass over a map. He wore an undress 
blue uniform with the three stars and three stripes 
of a full general on the sleeve, — no other decora- 
tion, though once before I had seen him wearing 
the first-class order of the Eising Sun. His parch- 
ment-krinkled face, brown like chocolate with a 
summer's torrid suns, beamed kindly on us. His 
smile and manner were fatherly. It was impossible 
to think that any complicated problem troubled his 
mind. A resemblance in facial contour to General 
Sherman arrested us, . . . with beard gray, 
shaded back to brown where it met the skin, so 
that he seemed a monotone in sepia, with eyes 
small and wide apart, perfect teeth, tiny, regular 
nose, and a beautiful dome of a head flaring out 
from the temples in tender and eloquent curves. 
He stands five feet ten, unusually tall for a Japan- 
ese, showing the loose power of a master in his 



joints and in that mighty jowl shaded by the gray- 
brown beard.' 

The following passage te\]s of a successful 
attack upon one of tiie forts, and is a sample 
of pages of similar writing. 

'At half -past four in the afternoon, Tereda orders 
the final charge. Three cheers go up — Banzail 
Banzai! Banzai! With bayonets fixed, the squads 
deploying as before, the khaki-covered spots begin 
to move. In advance the men crawl hand over 
hand, helped by blessed waraji (straw sandals). 
Twenty feet from the parapet they pause and fling 
something that leaps through the air like balls from 
catcher to second base. These hand-grenades of gun- 
cotton explode on and in the parapet. The brilliant 
bursts play off the fast setting evening, as the 
khaki-covered ones go in, Tereda pausing and peer- 
ing with his glass. The entire battalion tumbles 
over the parapet. Then the reserves begin climbing 
from the base. 

'Silence. All is over. What has happened? 
Five, ten minutes pass, then the firing recommences, 
but now the object is changed; all the Japanese 
shrapnel is playing over the road leading to the 
Chair fort, and all the Russian fire is directed 
against Xamicoyama. The Russians are retreating, 
throwing away their rifles as they run. Over Nami- 
coyama floats the white flag with the red son in. 
the centre.' 

Mr. Barry went forward to the limit of the 
trenches, within a few score yards of the enemy's 
outworks, where he saw greweome sights. It is 
small wonder, with the breastworks constructed 
in no small part of their own slain, the interval 
between tiironged with corpses, that Mr. Fred- 
eric Yilliers, present in seventeen campaigns, 
should have expressed himself thus, as reported 
by Mr. Barr\-: 

'Scientific warfare! Let me tell you the facts 
about science. Archibald Forbes predicted twenty 
years ago that the time would come when armies 
would no longer be able to take their wounded from 
the field of battle. That day has come. We are 
living in it. Wounded have existed — how, God 
alone knows! — on that field out there, without 
help, for twelve days, while shell and bullets rained 
above them, and if a comrade had dared to come 
to their assistance his would have been a useless 
suicide. The searchlight, the enginery of scientific 
trenches, machine guns, rifles point-blank at 200 
yards with a range of 2,000 — these things have 
helped to make warfare more terrible now than ever 
before in history.' 

The book entitled 'The Yellow War,' for 
which the initial ' ' is responsible as author, 
is of another sort, though dealing witli similar 
material. It is, as the brief ' Foreword ' avers, 
the work of one intimate with the war for a 
year, and an eye-witness of most that is 
described. It is concerned with fighting on sea 
as well as on land, and is more discriminating 
in its choice of incidents and of language than 
either of the foregoing books. There is much 
idealization rather than a precise report, and 
the result is an impression even more veritable 
than the others have been able to convey, not- 
withstanding a certain sense of the fiction that

is truer thani mere fact. An example of the 
quality of this book may be found in the fol- 
lowing graphic parage, which purports to give 
the details of the fighting on the Eussian flag- 
ship of the Pacific squadron in its last naval 
engagement, but which can be held as equally 
descriptive of the more recent fighting in the 
Corean Straits. 

'The great ship quivered — then quivered again. 
For a moment the flag-lieutenant thought that a 
torpedo had struck her. His nervous system remem- 
bered that first torpedo under Golden Hill. It was 
only the twelve-inch guns. But they made the con- 
ning-tower rock. The Japanese had manoeuvred, 
and were now standing in on the starboard beam. 
The Russian Admiral changed his course. Great 
projectiles were ricochetting overhead, and raising 
geysers of salt spray all round them. But for the 
present the flagship could answer shot for shot, and 
one of the hostile battleships — the Shikishima it 
looked like — had drawn out of the fighting line. 

'The Admiral clenched the handrail. His face 
was still pale, but the fighting light was in his eyes. 
For a moment his gaze turned from the Mikasa, 
with her black hull flashing yellow up and down its 
lean length. The mist was up again in the south- 
west, and the sea was rapidly getting up. 

' ' ' Make the fleet signal, ' Close up — follow me. ' ' ' 
Then he turned to the officer at the navigating tube : 
"For the promontory!" 

'At the same moment there was a deafening 
report, and the vessel swung so that every one in 
the conning-tower was thrown against the walls. 

' ' ' What was that — mined ? ' ' 

'The dread of mine and torpedo was by this time 
firmly ingrained in every Russian sailor, and as 
the flag-lieutenant sprang down the ladder the hor- 
rible nightmare of the Petropavlovsk leaped up 
before his mental vision. It was nothing. A deck 
officer, who seemed as unconcerned as if he were at 
manoeuvres, came hurrying forward. He reported 
that a large shell had hit the after 12-inch turret, 
glanced, and in bursting wrecked the top above. 

'The vessel staggered from two terrific blows 
forward. The flag-lieutenant stumbled ahead, draw- 
ing his hands mechanically to his ears, while the 
torn fragments of iron and splinter soughed past 
him. Biting, stinging smoke blinded him, while 
the force of the concussion flattened him against 
a ventilator. The first sight he saw was the man- 
gled frame of his comrade. The top of the poor 
wretch's head was gone; a half -burned cigarette 
was still between the clenched teeth. He threw his 
glance upwards, — the forward smoke-stack was 
rent from top to bottom, and the flame and smoke 
were licking round its base. The 12-inch guns in 
the forward battery solemnly fired, and the ear- 
splitting discharge brought the youth to his senses. 
He made for the ladder. Great God! the conning- 
tower and forward bridge were but torn, smoking, 
and twisted wreck. A man jumped to the deck. 
His face was as black as an Ethiopian's, his uni- 
form and beard torn and discolored to a filthy 
yellow; his left arm severed at the biceps, was dang- 
ling by a sinew. 

' "All are killed, the Admiral, — all!" the figure 
gasped, as it reeled and sank fainting to the deck. 

'Then the port gung fired. The flag-lieutenant 
realized that the ship was not steering — she was 
veering round. He dashed to the after-bridge, past 
the quick-firer crews lying prostrate, amid the 
wreckage and the corpses. He found the commander 



superintending the shipping of the after steering- 
gear, and reported the paralyzing intelligence. For 
a moment the commander looked at him blankly. 
He was bleeding from a skin wound in the neck, 
and such of his uniform not stained yellow was 
scarlet with blood. 

' "Good!" he ejaculated; "she is steering again. 
Full steam ahead! Make a fleet signal. Make the 
signal, 'The Admiral transfers the command." ' 

The sympathies of the writers of these three 
books, setting forth the rigors of war with a 
Verestchagin-like fidelity, adequately represent 
the feelings of the English-speaking world, 
English and Americans being quoted with, 
impartiality. All rejoice at Russia's downfall, 
as a menace to the more peaceful nations of the 
earth well removed. But what of the religions 
of Christ and Buddiha, apostles both of peace 
and life ? Little of their spirit and influence is 
to be found in the hideous scenes and incidents 
set forth in works like these.

Briefs on New Books. 

The story Professor Edwin E. Sparks 's latest 

of American work, 'The United States of Amer- 
nationaiity. jgj^^> constitutes a valuable addition 
to the 'Story of the Nations' series (Putnam). 
It is a pleasant variation from our usual expe- 
rience to find a work which out of some eight 
hundred pages devotes but twenty-two pages to 
the events of the years 1861-1865, and in these 
refers to but one battle. The space thus gained 
by eliminating 'drum and trumpet history,' Pro- 
fessor Sparks employs to good advantage in 
explaining the political and social growth of the 
United States, and the economic changes and 
currents of public opinion which characterized 
the first century of our national existence. The 
tone of the work is fair, and the author avoids 
unkind epithets and biassed partisan feeling. 
Yet one can hardly call the work a history in 
the truest sense; it is rather a prose epic of 
American nationality. It is frankly centralistic 
and expansionist. 'To apply to America,' says 
the author in conclusion, 'the term "the States," 
as in the custom in foreign lands, is to ignore 
both past history and present tendency. It is to 
think of units instead of a whole. Historically 
and prophetically, the United States as a fed- 
eration of States have ceased to exist and the 
United States as a centralized Republic has 
taken the place.' To this thesis the whole work 
leads up. A spade is called a spade, and _ no 
vain idealism is permitted to distort our vision. 
Thus, speaking of American ideals, Professor 
Sparks gives us neither the old-fashioned eagle 
screaming nor the modem cry of helpless 
negation and obstruction. Instead, his comment 
is this: 

' America Is not what many hoped it would be. What- 
ever social equality was construed Into the Declaration 
of Independence by enthusiasts and reformers has been 
abandoned. It Is now applied to equality of political 
rights, the only kind which self-government is author-

Ized to promise. Freedom of speech has been curtailed to 
freedom of sensible and unobjectionable speech. A dis- 
interested patriotism as an impulse has lost much of the 
confidence formerly placed in it. That men naturally 
place country above their own Interests is a maxim 
of former days, which is still proclaimed, but few 
believe or demonstrate by their actions. The individual 
was once considered apart from the mass. That is no 
longer possible. Government was once said to proceed 
from the consent of all the governed. Now we are satis- 
fied to say that it proceeds from a majority of the gov- 
erned, and are even willing to coerce the minority into 
submission. America was once said to be a refuge for 
the poor of all nations ; but self protection has placed 
many barriers before the doors. American simplicity both 
at home and abroad was once thought to be a special 
virtue. At present the ambition is to make as good a 
showing as your neighbor in order not to be conspic- 
uous or an object of ridicule. Large wealth was once 
considered as Indicative of an aristocracy and prophetic 
of nobility. Now it is acknowledged to be a most desir- 
able adjunct to a useful and happy life. Government was 
formerly declared to be instituted in America for the 
direct benefit of the individual. It now seeks this ben- 
efit indirectly through fostering the interests which fur- 
nish him with a livelihood. In other words, it is diffi- 
cult to create a new order of mankind even by placing 
man in a new environment unless the old inheritance is 
sorted out' (vol. II., pp. 373, 374). 

Of really unique worth are the illustrations, of 
which there is barely one without historic value. 
Many are reproductions of early political car- 
toons, which the general reader would rarely 
come across. Excellent press work and careful 
revision make the text pleasant reading, and the 
rarity of such obvious slips as 'Macon of Geor- 
gia' (vol. II., p. 74), only shows the general 
accuracy of the work. 

Last of the 'Books of jokes are proverbially 

'Notes from dull,' says Sir Mountstuart E. 
a Diary.' Grant Duff in his 'Notes from a 

Diary, 1896-1901' (Dutton). These volumes, the 
thirteenth and fourteenth of a series reaching 
back, in date of items selected, to 1851, are 
largely devoted to pleasantries, heard or read or 
uttered by the writer, and though by no means 
dull reading are a little cloj'ing if taken in 
course and at a sitting. They form, we are told 
in a prefatory note, the final instalment of the 
series; but is it not just possible, and indeed 
rather to be hoped, that the diarist, like many 
another celebrity before him, will change his 
mind and make one or more further farewell 
appearances? The English 'Who's Who' records 
as our author's recreations, fencing, botanizing, 
travelling, and conversation; and one who con- 
verses so well and has a knack of hearing so 
many good things said, ought to let his light 
shine. His manner, it is to be inferred, is not 
exactly that of a Johnson, who delights to lay 
mind to mind in an Atellectual wrestling match, 
or still better to fold his legs and have his talk 
out in monologue; it is rather the light fencing 
and graceful repartee of a Chesterfield. He 
refers with evident satisfaction to 'a perfect 
debauch of interesting talk' in which he took 
part on one occasion. It is curious to note his 
repeated references to Mrs. Craven and her 
'Recit d'uneSoeur.' Here, as in former volumes, 
she is evidently on his mind. A good story about 
Samuel Warren is short enough to quote. War- 
ren published his 'Ten Thousand a Year' anony- 



mously, but was none the less desirous to have 
its authorship known, introducing the subject 
in season and out of season. Waiting for a 
train with Sergeant Ballantine, he asked him if 
he had any idea who wrote the book. 'Well, 
Warren,' was the reply, 'there are not many 
to whom I would entrust the secret; but it is 
safe to do so to you. The truth is, I wrote it 
myself!' Another story, less credible, is also 
good and short. Horace Smith, at the christen- 
ing of a daughter, was asked by the clergyman 
for the name to be given to the child. 'Rosa- 
lind,' answered Smith. 'Rosalind, Rosalind,' 
repeated the clergjTnan in perplexity, 'I never 
heard such a name. How do you spell it?' 'Oh, 
as you like it,' was the ready rejoinder. For 
some occult reason, or for no reason, the author 
gives the name of Fanny Kemble's husband as 
Piers Butler; othenvise his pages seem to be 
admirably free from noticeable errors. 

A plea for the Dr. Henry G. Hanehett's book on 
appreciation 'The Art of the Musician' (Mac- 
0/ music. millan) is addressed to all students 

of music, whether performers or not, and is 
'designed to emphasize the distinction between 
the real study of music and the study of the 
arts of playing and singing which has so long 
been mistaken for it.' The author's chief plea 
is for the understanding of music as an art — 
the understanding of the rhythms, harmonies, 
melodies, and motives which composers have 
used, and their aims, purposes, and methods in 
using them. With this object in view. Dr. Han- 
chett has made a unique and useful book, and 
one which goes far to demonstrate his theory 
that music can be thoroughly and usefully 
taught without teaching the art of performance. 
He insists that 'the true assthetic delight to be 
derived from the art of the musician is some- 
thing widely different from and far above the 
mere sensuous charms of musical sounds, how- 
ever luscious,' and agrees with St. Paul that he 
'would rather speak five words with his under- 
standing than ten thousand words in an unknown 
tongue.' Thorough and scholarly understanding 
he himself has, combined with a rare clearness 
of statement and keenness of analysis. He calls 
rhythm the life of music, harmony its soul, 
melody and phrasing its beauty, and motives its 
germ. Not everyone may incline to the changes 
he suggests in musical phraseology— 'meter' for 
'time,' 'clause' for 'phrase' (except when all 
the notes under one slur are meant), 'mozarta* 
for 'sonata-form.' But everyone can learn much 
from the examples of music he gives with mark- 
ings which point unmistakably to the art used 
in their composition,— studies of rhythm from 
Bach, Chopin, and Schumann, of melodies from 
Rheinberger and Schubert, of theme-develop- 
ment from Beethoven, and so on through a wide- 
ly varied list. Technically, this latter is the 
most valuable part of the volume. In the clos- 
ing chapters on Interpretation and Musical 
Education Dr. Hanchett maintains, with pointed 
good sense, his thesis that 'What we need is 
education in music; not more professors, but 



420

more amateurs; not more concerts, but more 
intelligent interest in those we have; not more 
compositions, but more comprehension; not more 
vocal culture, but more and larger choral 
societies; not more technic, but more interpreta- 
tion.' In spite of his faith that one may be a 
cultivated musician without being a performer, 
Dr. Hanchett gives the final praise to the inter- 
preter—the artist who absorbs the composer's 
thought, and gives to compositions their crowning 
touch by interpreting their beauties to the 
world. 

Brisk and breezy, we will not say 

b'^a^welter^r ^^®^^ ^^^ frisky, but certainly 
instinct with the indescribable and 
unmistakable buoyancy and vitality of the great 
West, combined with something of the rich 
scholarship more often associated with the older 
East, Miss Kate Stephens's 'American Thumb- 
Prints' (Lippincott) deserves more than cursory 
notice at the reviewer's hands. The first chapter, 
'Puritans of the West,' presents some striking 
peculiarities of the writer's fellow-Kansans. The 
matter with Kansas appears to be too many 
'isms. Chapter two, 'The University of Hes- 
perus '— which is, being interpreted, the Univer- 
sity of Kansas — discusses with the wisdom of 
bitter experience some of the evils afflicting a 
state university. The woman professor dismissed 
from the Greek chair much on the rotation-in- 
oflfice principle, one surmises to have been Miss 
Stephens herself. At any rate, her abundant 
allusions to and quotations from Hellenic litera- 
ture go to show her ability to fill such a chair. 
The St. Louis and the New England types of 
men and women are treated at some length. 
The parting hit at 'the distorted morality and 
debilitating religion' to which the writer says 
Yankee women (and men, too, we infer) have 
been subjected, is, to say the least, a rather 
harsh way of expressing oneself. Like Mr. Paul 
Elmer More, Miss Stephens makes Christian 
Science a direct descendant of New England 
transcendentalism. 'The idealism of Emerson 
foreran the dollar-gathering idealism of Mrs. 
Mary Baker Eddy as the lark of spring foreruns 
the maple worm.' Lack of space forbids argu- 
ment or protest here. A retrospective and pros- 
pective treatise on cookery, displaying scholarly 
research, forms the seventh essay; and a decid- 
edly informing and original presentation of 
Franklin as a plagiarist closes the book. A word 
in conclusion on Miss Stephens's style. Pos- 
sessing as she does a command of excellent Eng- 
lish, she does not need to write in polyglot. A 
lavish sprinkling of foreign words and phrases, 
undistinguished by italics or quotation marks, 
may delight the philologist, but it annoys the 
unlearned reader. The translation, too, is often 
quite as effective, even to a scholar, as the orig- 
inal. 'Unextinguishable laughter' will be rec- 
ognized by the Homeric student as readily as its 
Greek equivalent, and will bewilder no one. Too 
frequent quotation, in any language, is the trick 
of one whose learning sits not quite easily on the 
shoulders. A few unnecessary departures from 



common usage arrest the eye in Miss Stephens's 
pages, as fool for foolish, pertain for obtain or 
prevail, and longanimity for the shorter and 
equally expressive patience. Her 'summa sum- 
marium' it is safe to take for a mere misprint. 



Sydney Smith, Mr. G. W. E. Russell contributes 
reformer to the 'English Men of Letters' 

and wit. series (Macmillan) a biography of 

Sydney Smith, which will be opened with much 
eagerness, and laid aside with some disappoint- 
ment, by the admirers— still sufficiently numer- 
ous — of the robust, manly, witty parson who 
brightened the literature of the early nineteenth 
century. It is not that the book is ill done— 
quite the contrary; but that Mr. Russell, who 
is an expert maker of biographies, has been 
working, as he says, 'in a harvest field where 
a succession of diligent gleaners had preceded' 
him; and has not added very much to what was 
previously known. It is just fifty years since 
Sydney Smith's daughter Saba, Lady Holland, 
issued a volume of her father's memoirs, on 
which she had been engaged for ten years suc- 
ceeding his death in 1845; and to this was soon 
added a volume of extracts from his letters, com- 
piled by Mrs. Austin. In 1856, Mr. Evert A. 
Duyckinck published (through the forgotten 
house of J. S. Redfield, New York), a work enti- 
tled 'Sydney Smith's Wit and Wisdom,' quar- 
ried largely from the collected 'Works,' the 
Lady Holland 'Memoirs,' and the Austin 'Let- 
ters.' Mr. Duyckinck 's book remains the best 
compilation extant on Sydney Smith; and Mr. 
Russell's smaller work, good though it is, has 
only sent us back (on the Emersonian principle) 
with renewed zest to the larger collection. Mr. 
Russell's chief merit, then, consists, not in new 
material discovered, or in any specially clever 
exploitation of the existing material, but in the 
shrewd and kindly criticism which he bestows 
upon Sydney Smith's energy, goodness, wit, and 
occasional foibles. His battles for Catholic eman- 
cipation, his keen satires on the weaknesses of 
Anglicanism, his complete failure to do justice 
to Dissent, his imperfect sympathies (as Lamb 
would have called them) with art and music; 
and over, in, and through all, the bubbling 
perennial fountain of a wit that was as sponta- 
neous as Schubert's music— all these are 'tasted' 
for us by Mr. Russell with much intelligent 
relish. His book will properly hold its place 
in the series, and serve as an adequate intro- 
duction to the study of Sydney Smith. 



Dr. Mahaffy's Students of Classical history and 
lectures on civilization will be interested in a 

Hellenism. i^^^^^ volume on 'The Progi-ess of 

Hellenism' (University of Chicago Press) by 
Professor J. P. Mahaffy of Dublin. The learned 
author has written much on Greek subjects, and 
in this book he sums up the conclusions that he 
has reached after years of study of Greek civi- 
lization as developed at Athens and Antioch and 
Alexandria. Six lectures delivered at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago in the summer of 1904 make 
up the work. In the opening lecture Professor

Mahaffy discusses 'Xenophon the Precursor of 
Hellenism,' whom he views as a somewhat cos- 
mopolitan Greek, one of larger tastes and 
broader views than those possessed by the aver- 
age cultured Athenian. Through his extensive 
travels he had come in contact with Oriental civ- 
ilization, of which he had absorbed a great deal, 
at the same time losing certain characteristics 
and surrendering certain opinions that would be 
classed as distinctly Greek or Athenian. The 
development of Athenian culture after it had 
been transplanted to Macedon, Syria, and Egypt 
is the subject of the following three lectures. 
The author does not find that Hellenism was the 
formal and sterile thing that it is reputed to 
be: it produced a literature that inspired Tirgil 
and ser\-ed as a model for the writers of the 
Christian gospels; it gave us the Victory of 
Samothrace and the Venus of Melos; it left us 
the Corinthian style of architecture. Of par- 
ticular interest is the closing lecture in. which 
the author discusses Hellenic influences on 
Christianity. A deeper meaning is given to the 
trite statement that Greek was the language of 
the apostolic missionaries. The author holds 
'that the peculiar modemness, the high intellec- 
tual standard of Christianity, as we find it in 
the New Testament, is caused by its contact 
with Greek culture,' Tbe doctrine of the logos 
as presented in the gosp>el of St. John is, he 
believes, *a purely Hellenistic conception derived 
ultimately from Plato.' In St. Paul's epistles 
F^rofessor Mahaffy finds much of the phrase- 
ology of Stoicism, and also some peculiarly 
Stoic doctrines, notably the doctrines of the 
unity of the human race, the value of the human 
soul, the active nature of human virtue, and the 
necessity of complete reform of each individual 
life, or what may be called conversion. In a 
lecture the author cannot, of course, present 
much evidence; but the subject is of too great 
interest to be disi>osed of in a few pages, and 
we trust Professor Mahaffy will discuss it more 
fully in his promised work on 'Greek Life from 
Polvbius to Plutarch.' 



An album A pleasant souvenir of the remark- 

of Schiller ablv successful Schiller celebration 
tributes. i^^i^ £jj Chicago last month takes 

the shape of a quarto volume, 'Zur Wiirdigung

Koelling & Klappenbach, Chicago. The princi- 
pal contents of this volume consist of about 
eighty tributes and appreciations, contributed 
by both Germans and Americans, and here 
reproduced in autograph facsimile. The Presi- 
dent of the United States and the King of 
TTiirtemberg lead off in this symposium, and are 
followed by such notabilities as Presidents Gil- 
man, Hadley, and Wheeler, Professors Carruth, 
Cutting, Goebel, Hatfield, von Klenze, Learned, 
Matthews, Miinsterberg, and Thomas, and Messrs. 
Paul Carus, Heinrich Conried, W. T. Harris. 
T. W. Higginson, Henrj- Holt, TV. S. Schley, and 
Carl Schurz. The contributions of these gentle- 
men and others are varied, including pKjems, per- 



sonal tributes, critical appreciations, and trans- 
lations. The fine sonnet of Professor Calvin 
Thomas may be given by way of illustration. 

' He kept the faith. The ardent poet- soul. 

Once thrilled to madness by the fiery gleam 
Of Freedom glimpsed afar in youthful dream. 

Henceforth was true as needle to the pole. 

The vision he had caught remained the goal 
Of manhood's aspiration and the theme 
Of those high luminous musings that redeem 

Our souls from bondage to the general dole 

Of trivial existence. Calm and free. 

He faced the Sphinx, nor ever knew dismay. 
Nor bowed he to extremities the knee 

Nor took a guerdon from the fleeting day. 

But dwelt on earth in that eternity 

Where Truth and Beauty shine with blended ray.' 

The publication contains, besides this interest- 
ing autograph material, complete programmes of 
the Chicago exercises, the prize poems (in Eng- 
lish and German) written for the occasion, and 
a series of illustrations— portraits, pictorial 
scenes, and reproduced title-pages. Taken alto- 
gether, it is a creditable production. 

A group of We have received from the Gut«n-

ing publications, of which a few notes may be 
made. 'Das Maifest der Benediktiner und An- 
dere Erzahlungen, ' by the late Karl Rick, is the 
third edition of the three stories comprised with- 
in the volume. The stories are pictures from the 
life of the Catholic clergy, and are remarkable 
for their psychological insight as well as for 
their intimate acquaintance with the themes pre- 
sented. Rick (1815-1881) was an Austrian poet 
and novelis£ of distinction, and the present 
volume has an introduction by his son, Herr 
Wofgang Rick. 'Wunder und Wissenschaf t, ' by 
Dr. Richard Hennig, is a book of popular science, 
dealing with the 'occult phenomena' of hypnotic 
suggestion, the sub-liminal consciousness, and 
telepathy. The treatment is not imscientifie, 
although it seems to us to go too far in the 
direction of credulity, or of willingness to accept 
as thinkable certain alleged happenings which to 
most well-balanced minds are flatly impossible. 
It must be admitted that Dr. Hennig is not with- 
out good company in his conclusions. Dr. J. 
Loewenberg's 'Deutsche Dichterabende' is a 
volume of studies in modem German literature. 
Among the subjects of the essays are Lenau, 
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach, Herr Detlev von 
Liliencron, Herr Gustav Frenssen, and Herr 
Hauptmaim. A thin volume reprints the 'Rede 
auf Schiller' of Jakob Grimm, an address given 
in Berlin in 1859, and very timely in this year of 
Schiller celebrations. An 'Auswahl aus den 
Kleinen Schriften von Jakob Grimm,* with an 
introduction by Dr. Schultze, gives us Grimm's 
' Selbstbiographie, ' his Schiller address, his 
address upon the death of his brother, and his 
paper upon his dismissal from Gottingen in 1837. 
This latter is a document of great importa.nce in 
the history of the German stnigele for intellec- 
tual freedom. Several brief philological papers 
are also included. Finally, this group of publi- 
cations reprints in a handsome volimie the trans-

lations made by the Grimm brothers of Ekke- 
hard's 'Walthari-lied,' of 'Der Arme Heinrieh,' 
and of the songs from the Elder Edda. 

Shortcuts From ancestors whose work in the 

to health field and shop would have made 

and strength. anything in the nature of addi- 
tional 'exercise' appear preposterous, the mod- 
ern American has come to be a person who sits 
at a desk throughout the hours of sun and seeks 
to make up the resulting inevitable physical 
deficiencies by spasmodic movements of one sort 
and another in the privacy of his apartment. As 
a result he is accumulating at a rapid rate a 
library on the art of keeping well by devoting a 
few minutes to real muscular labor while spend- 
ing many hours in doing his best to fall ill. 
Two contributions of this sort appear nearly 
simultaneously: Mr. George Elliot Flint's 'Power 
and Health through Progressive Exercise' (Ba- 
ker & Taylor Co.), and Mr. H. Irving Hancock's 
'The Physical Culture Life: A Guide for All 
Who Seek the Simple Laws of Abounding 
Health' (Putnam). Mr. Flint's book is devoted 
to proof that the way to get strong is to take 
those exercises, chiefly by the use of parallel 
bars and heavy weights, that make the utmost 
demand upon the muscles,— a proposition that 
would be self-evident to the least intelligent if 
there had not arisen a curious school which caters 
to the physically slothful by making them believe 
that great strength can be produced through 
trifling exertion. It is pleasant to find Mr. Flint 
not so wholly committed to his ideas that he is 
unwilling to concede to swimming the palm for 
being the best and most wholesome of all forms 
of physical effort. Mr. Hancock is in sub- 
stantial agreement with Mr. Flint on the main 
question raised, and takes it rather for granted. 
He improves, we believe, on Mr. Flint's pre- 
scriptions by introducing a number of exercises 
in which the element of play and of rivalry 
enters, passe-tem/ps h deux so to speak. A brief 
introduction to Mr. Flint's book, written by his 
father. Dr. Austin Flint, confirms the son's 
opinions, and the work is illustrated by photo- 
graphs of the author in action. Mr. Hancock 
uses pictures of others, and he has much to say 
about hygiene in all its aspects. Both books 
shoTild act as stimulants to the slothful and 
those whose waist line is growing unduly. 



. With keen insight and a peculiar 

essays*^ art. warmth of description, Mr. Ken- 
yon Cox has given us, in 'Old 
Masters and New' (Fox, Duffield & Co.), a 
series of appreciations of individual masters of 
art— a sort of vade mecum presenting, in a gen- 
eral way, the course of painting since the six- 
teenth century. The author states that his book 
has the unity of a point of view — that of a 
painter, seeing with his own eyes and not 
bound by authority; it expresses the feeling and 
the judgments of one who practices, with credit, 
one of the arts of which he writes. Much of the 
material used has appeared at different times 
during the past twenty years in various peri- 



odicals, but it has been subjected to thorough 
revision, so that the more youthful essays con- 
tain no expressions which the author does not 
still hold. He points out that art in the past 
has been traditional, national, and homogeneous; 
art in our day has been individual, international, 
and chaotic. Modern means of commimieation 
and modem methods of reproduction have 
brought the ends of the earth together, and 
placed the art of all times and countries at the 
disposal of every artist. While in no sense a 
systematic history of art, Mr. Cox has so har- 
monized his colors, and weaved them into a s3tii- 
metrical whole, that his work will appeal not 
only to the artist and scholar, but to the ordi- 
nary lay reader of intelligence. 



Chapters for Polite learning of a delightful sort 
the meditative pervades the pages of the anony- 
fisherman. j^^^^g volume entitled 'Super 

Flumina: Angling Observations of a Coarse 
Fisherman' (John Lane)— the word 'coarse' m 
the sub-title referring to the quality of the fish 
caught and not at all to the angler himself. The 
book might be summarized briefly as a modem 
and more erudite revival of Izaak Walton, so 
gentle and humane is its attitude towards the 
finny tribe, so liberal and comprehensive its 
learning. In this latter respect, and in its 
knowledge of human nature, ancient and modem, 
it is reminiscent also of Montaigne. These things 
must indicate that it is a very good book indeed. 
There is a chapter of more than ordinary humor 
'In Dispraise of the Latins,' inspired by the dis- 
respectful attitude of the Romans toward fish 
iu any other aspect than as a means of humaa 
sustenance. The Greeks gain the author's appro- 
bation, because they were so much more of 
the gentleman and so much less of the pot 
fisherman. Several chapters are devoted to 
specific 'coarse' fish, such as the pike, dace, 
perch, and chub, and these are shown to have 
virtues and characteristics quite at odds with 
the adjective used to describe the quality of 
their flesh. But there is a deal of practical 
learning also, and a plea for rational economy 
in the use of rods, reels, and flies. No better 
gift for an ingrained fisherman who preserves 
the meditative tradition could be found in re- 
cent literature. 

New volumes in -^ volume of ' Selections from the 
the 'Musician's Music Dramas of Richard Wagner,' 
Library.' arranged for the piano by Mr. Otto 

Singer, is a recent addition to the 'Musician's 
Library' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co. The 
transcriptions are not too difiicult for the ordi- 
nary amateur, and illustrate the eleven dramas 
from 'Rienzi' to 'Parsifal.' There are twenty- 
four numbers in all. A portrait of Wagner, a 
facsimile of ' Tristan ' manuscript, a bibliography, 
and an introductory essay by Mr. Richard Aldrich, 
are the accessory features of this singularly wel- 
come volume. Another addition to this series 
is a book of 'Twenty-four Negro Melodies', tran- 
scribed for the piano by Mr. S. Coleridge-Taylor. 
This is an extremely interesting work. The com-

poser has sought to do for the melodies of his 
race what has been done for Hungarian and 
Bohemian and Norwegian melodies by Brahms, 
Dvorak, and Grieg. Each number is prefaced 
by the original melody in motto form, and con- 
sists of a series of variations upon the theme thus 
presented. The special interest of this work is 
that it gives us ^not only American plantation 
songs (which are to some degree sophisticated) 
but also primitive examples from several regions 
in Africa. Mr. Booker T. Washington provides 
the volume with an introduction. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



* The Athlete's Garland ' (McClurg), compiled by 
Mr. Wallace Eiee, is 'the first attempt in any 
language to gather together verses relating exclu- 
sively to athletic sports.' The volume is happily 
prefaced by a couplet from William Morris: 
'For no fame may a man win better the while he hath his 

life 
Than from what his feet have accomplished, or his hands 

amid the strife.' 

The selections are from a wide range of authors, 
English and American, and number about one hun- 
dred and fifty. Something like thirty sports and 
games are celebrated, the favorites being boating, 
cricket, football, and golf. Each of these subjects 
has a score or so of poems. Strange to say, an 
exhaustive search through Canadian literature 
yielded no pieces in celebration of la crosse and 
tobogganing, although the Canadian poets are other- 
wise well represented. Good taste and judgment 
characterize this selection throughout, and it is sure 
of a welcome from all lovers of sport. 

The new 'Biographical' edition of Eobert Louis 
Stevenson, now in course of publication by the 
Messrs. Scribner, finds its chief excuse for being 
in the series of introductions written by Mrs. Stev- 
enson, on much the same plan as in Mrs. Eichmond 
Eitchie's edition of Thackeray. These prefaces, 
though brief, are of much interest, and the edition 
is in all other ways an attractive one. The volumes 
are convenient in size, clearly and openly printed 
on thin paper, and bound in prettily-stamped maroon 
cloth. For the many who cannot hope to possess the 
expensive ' Edinburgh ' or ' Thistle ' sets, this edition 
will prove a decided boon, and we fancy that even 
the owners of those works will be glad to have this 
also. Six volumes have so far appeared. 

'Shakespeare: The Man and his Works' is a 
little book published by Messrs. Sibley & Co. It has 
for its contents a reprint of all the matter about 
Shakespeare contained in 'Moulton's Library of 
Literary Criticism,' and thus serves the double pur- 
pose of calling attention to the merits of that 
admirable work and of providing students of Shakes- 
peare with a compendium of the opinion of critics 
new and old concerning the greatest of poets and 
his separate plays. 

'The Student's American History,' by Mr. D. H. 
Montgomery, is a text-book upon Lines similar 
to those followed in the author's 'Leading Facts,' 
but is much fuller than that elementary work in 
its treatment of political and constitutional topics. 
It has all the teaching apparatus of the best type 
of modern high-school book, and may be cordially 
recommended. Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publish- 
ers. 



Notes. 



'The Corrected English New Testament,' edited 
by Mr. Samuel Lloyd, and given ecclesiastical ap- 
proval in a preface contributed by the Bishop of 
Durham, is published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. 

Professor Albert S. Cook has edited for the Oxford 
Clarendon Press the Old EngUsh poem 'The Dream 
of the Rood,' attributed to Cynewulf. Ten pages 
of text to one hundred of apparatus is a statement 
of the proportions of this little volume. 

'The Historic Role of France among the Nations' 
is a pamphlet publication of the University of 
Chicago. It gives us a translation, by Professor T. 
A. Jenkins, of the address given before the Uni- 
versity last October by Professor Charles-Victor 
Langlois. 

Messrs. John W. Luce & Co., Boston, publish a 
volume of 'Epigrams and Aphorisms,' selected from 
the writings of Oscar Wilde, and prefaced by Mr. 
George Henry Sargent, whose brief but sympathetic 
introduction predisposes the reader to appreciate 
what follows. 

'Who Said That?' by Mr. Edward Latham, and 
'Who Wrote That?' by Mr. W. S. W. Anson, are 
two reference books, of vest-pocket dimensions, pub- 
lished by Messrs. B. P. Dutton & Co. The nature 
of their contents is sufficiently indicated by their 
respective titles. 

M. Georges Pellissier is the author of a volume 
of 'Etudes de Litterature et de Morale Contempo- 
raines' (Paris: Comely), which discourse mainly of 
modern French literature. Among the more recent 
authors considered in this score of brief essays are 
MM. Marcel Barriere, de Vogiie, Barres, Prevost, 
and de Regnier. 

An anthology, for college use, of * The Chief Poets 
of America' has been made by Mr. Curtis Hidden 
Page, and will be published later in the year by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The selections 
from each author will be prefaced by a brief bio- 
graphical and critical introduction, and a full list 
of references. 

'Briefs on Public Questions,' by Mr. Ralph Curtis 
Ringwalt, is a companion volume to that author's 
'Briefs for Debate,' and is published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. There are twenty-five 
subjects, each with a selected list of references. 
High-school and college students will give this book 
a warm welcome. 

To the 'Temple Autobiographies,' published by 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., there has been added 
'The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,' edited 
by Mr. William Macdonald. This is one of the 
charming Dent reprints, and is noteworthy as being 
the first edition of the fuU and authentic text to be 
printed in England. 

An English nature calendar entitled 'The Country 
Day by Day, ' by Mr. E. Kay Robinson, will be pub- 
lished this month by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
The author has aimed to fit each day with its proper 
seasonal accompaniment in the form of a note about 
the life of birds, animals, insects, or some distinct- 
ive aspect of nature. 

A volume of 'Specimen Letters,' selected and 
edited by Professor Albert S. Cook and Mr. Allen 
R. Benham, is a recent publication of Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. The collection is an admirable one, repre- 
sentative of every form of the epistolary art, and 
made particularly attractive to the general reader 
bv its freedom from editorial encumbrances.

THE DIAL. 



[June 16, 



Among the books of the now half -forgotten seven- 
teenth century lawyer, courtier, and author, Francis 
Quarles, perhaps the most interesting for the pres- 
ent-day reader is his 'Sions Sonets,' a poetical par- 
aphrase of the Song of Songs. In this work 
Quarles succeeded in retaining no little of the im- 
passioned beauty of the Hebrew book, and 
achieved besides a few flashes of original poetic fire. 
As was common in his day, Quarles regarded the 
Song as a religious allegory, representing the union 
of Christ and the Church; but beyond a few the- 
ological references in the form of footnotes, this 
interpretation is not forced upon the reader. In 
reprinting 'Sions Sonets' as one of their Eiverside 
Press Editions, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
have performed a grateful task. The little book is 
a charming one in every detail of make-up. It is 
printed on handmade paper of antique tone, from 
a large size of old-style type set within rules, the 
whole effect being a most successful imitation of 
seventeenth-century typography. The binding is of 
boards, appropriately crimson in hue. Four hun- 
dred and thirty copies only have been printed.
